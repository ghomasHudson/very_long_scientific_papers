The Standard Model of elementary particles can not be the final theory.
There are theoretical reasons to expect the appearance of new physics,
possibly at the energy scale of few TeV. Several possible theories of
new physics have been proposed, each with unknown probability to be
confirmed. Instead of arbitrarily choosing to examine one of those
theories, this thesis is about searching for any sign of new physics in
a model-independent way. This search is performed at the Collider
Detector at Fermilab (CDF).

The Standard Model prediction is implemented in all final states
simultaneously, and an array of statistical probes is employed to search
for significant discrepancies between data and prediction. The probes
are sensitive to overall population discrepancies, shape disagreements
in distributions of kinematic quantities of final particles, excesses of
events of large total transverse momentum, and local excesses of data
expected from resonances due to new massive particles.

The result of this search, first in 1 fb @xmath and then in 2 fb @xmath
, is null, namely no considerable evidence of new physics was found.
