This thesis determines some of the implications of non-universal and emergent
universal statistics on arithmetic correlations and fluctuations of arithmetic
functions, in particular correlations amongst prime numbers and the variance of
the expected number of prime numbers over short intervals are generalised by
associating these concepts to $L$-functions arising from number theoretic
objects.
