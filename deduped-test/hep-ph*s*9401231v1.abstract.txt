The extended technicolor theory is a candidate of the physics beyond the
standard model. To explain the mass hierarchy of the quarks and leptons, the
extended technicolor gauge symmetry must hierarchically break to the
technicolor gauge symmetry. Tumbling gauge theory is considered as a candidate
of the dynamics of such hierarchical symmetry breaking, since the sequential
self-breaking of the gauge symmetry (``tumbling'') can be expected in that
theory. It is well known that the extended technicolor theory induces too
strong flavor-changing neutral current interactions to be consistent with the
experiments. This problem can be solved if the technicolor dynamics is the
special one with very large anomalous dimension of the composite operator
${\bar T}T$ composed by the technifermion field $T$. Two types of the models
with large anomalous dimension have been proposed. One is the gauge theory with
slowly running coupling, another is the gauge theory with strong four fermion
interaction. It is expected that the large anomalous dimension is realized in
the tumbling gauge theory. In this thesis we systematically estimate the
strength of the effective four fermion interactions induced in the tumbling
gauge theory
