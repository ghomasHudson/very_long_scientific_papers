In this thesis, we review and examine the replica method from several
viewpoints. The replica method is a mathematical technique to calculate general
moments of stochastic variables. This method provides a systematic way to
evaluate physical quantities and becomes one of the most important tools in the
theory of spin glasses and in the related discipline including information
processing tasks.
  In spite of the effectiveness of the replica method, it is known that several
problems exist in the procedures of the method itself. The replica symmetry
breaking is the central topic of those problems and is the main issue of this
thesis. To elucidate this point, we review the recent progress about the
replica symmetry breaking including its physical and mathematical descriptions
in detail.
  Based on those descriptions, several spin-glass models and Ising perceptron
are deeply investigated.
