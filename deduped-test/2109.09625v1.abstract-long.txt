The focus of this thesis is the construction and analysis of efficient
representations in nonlinear signal processing, and the applications of
these structures to inverse problems in a variety of fields. The work is
composed of three major sections, each associated with a different form
of data:

-   Regression and Distance Estimation on Graphs and Riemannian
    Manifolds.

-   Instantaneous Time-Frequency Analysis via Synchrosqueezing.

-   Multiscale Dictionaries of Slepian Functions on the Sphere.
