We are living in a world which is getting more and more interconnected
and, as physiological effect, the interaction between the entities
produces more and more information. This high throughput generation
calls for techniques able to reduce the volume of the data, but still
able to preserve the carried knowledge. Data compression and
summarization techniques are one of the possible approaches to face such
problems. The aim of this thesis is to devise a new pipeline for
compressing and decompressing a graph by exploiting Szemerédi’s
Regularity Lemma. In particular, it has been developed a procedure
called CoDec (Compression-Decompression) which is based on Alon et al’s
constructive version of the Regularity Lemma. We provide an extensive
experimental evaluation to measure how robust is the framework as we
both corrupt the structures carried by the graph and add noisy edges
among them. The experimental results make us confident that our method
can be effectively used as a graph compression technique able to
preserve meaningful patterns of the original graph.
