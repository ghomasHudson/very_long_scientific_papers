## Chapter 1 Introduction

“A plasma is a quasineutral gas of charged and neutral particles which
exhibits collective behaviour” [ 12 ] It is often referred to as the
“fourth” state of matter, following the well-known solid, liquid and
gaseous states, because of the special collective behaviour involved. It
was first identified by Sir William Crookes in @xmath in a Crookes tube,
who named it “radiant matter”. [ 13 ] The term “plasma” was coined by
Irving Langmuir in @xmath considering that the electrified fluid carries
high velocity electrons, ions and impurities in a similar way of the
blood plasma which carries red and white corpuscles and germs. [ 14 , 15
] The Greek word “ @xmath ” (“plasma”) means “moldable substance”. Since
the mercury arc that Irving Langmuir used to study oscillations in
ionised gases diffuses through the whole glass chamber, and molds
itself, this may be another reason for Irving Langmuir to call the
ionised gas “plasma”. [ 16 ]

Although the plasma rarely exists in our natural life due to its high
temperature, more than @xmath of the matter of the universe is believed
to be composed of plasmas, e. g. stellar interiors and atmospheres,
gaseous nebulae and much of the interstellar medium, excluding the more
speculative nature of dark matter. [ 12 , 17 ] The field of plasma
physics can be dated back to @xmath s when Langmuir, Tonks and their
collaborators worked on gas discharges. It was significantly advanced
later by the nuclear fusion program and industrial applications of
plasma processing. [ 18 , 19 ] Plasma physics is the underlying science
of space and solar physics, astrophysics, and finds applications in
diverse areas of MagnetoHydroDynamics (MHD) energy conversion and ion
propulsion, solid state plasmas and gas lasers. [ 12 ]

Both space and laboratory plasmas can be associated with static magnetic
field, and the field geometry varies from uniform to non-uniform. This
thesis investigates the impact of magnetic geometry on wave modes in
cylindrical plasmas. The cylindrical configuration is chosen so as to
explore this impact in a tractable but experimentally realisable
configuration. Three magnetic geometries are considered: uniform,
focused and rippled.

This chapter first introduces the plasma source employed in the thesis,
and then illustrates four magnetic geometries. Specifically, the
dispersion relation of helicon waves, which drive the helicon discharge
and will be considered in detail in the following chapters, is derived
from a cold-plasma dielectric tensor perspective. Then the concept of
helicon discharge is given, together with its typical applications. We
select low temperature helicon plasma sources for comparison to
experiments, both because of availability, and diagnostic opportunities.
Finally, examples of helicon discharge with uniform (WOMBAT, Waves On
Magnetised Beams And Turbulence [ 20 ] ) and focused magnetic fields
(MAGPIE, MAGnetised Plasma Interaction Experiment [ 8 ] ), large linear
plasma device with multiple magnetic mirrors (LAPD, LArge Plasma Device
[ 9 ] ), and magnetic confinement fusion with toroidal magnetic field
(tokamak) are given. Gap eigenmodes that will be formed in a linear
plasma with rippled magnetic field, by introducing a local defect to the
system’s periodicity, are applicable to understanding the gap-mode
formation and its interaction with energetic particles in tokamaks. [ 21
]

### 1.1 Plasma source

Although a cold plasma model, which assumes zero-temperature
frictionless fluids of ions and electrons, ignores physics such as
pressure and flow, it is tractable in its mathematical analysis and
provides a remarkably accurate description of the common small-amplitude
perturbations that are possible for a hot plasma. [ 22 ] Particularly,
it is applicable to plasmas and physics for which the thermal effects
and particle motions are ignorable, e. g low-temperature plasma and
long-time scale problems. For the helicon discharge studied in this
thesis, the temperature is low, and so we utilise the cold plasma model
to describe helicon waves and shear Alfvén waves. The approach that is
followed is essentially that of Stix, and Gurnett and Bhattacharjee. [
22 , 23 ] .

#### 1.1.1 Helicon wave

##### Conductivity tensor and dielectric tensor

We start from the first of Maxwell’s equations

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the plasma current @xmath and the vacuum displacement @xmath have
been combined into the electric displacement @xmath . Here, @xmath and
@xmath are the electric and magnetic fields, respectively, @xmath is the
permeability of free space, @xmath is the permittivity of free space,
and @xmath is time. The conductivity tensor @xmath and the dielectric
tensor @xmath are defined as:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

respectively. We substitute Eq. ( 1.2 ) into Eq. ( 1.1 ) and consider
perturbations of the general form @xmath , with @xmath the wave vector,
@xmath the space vector, and @xmath the wave frequency. The relation
between @xmath and @xmath is thus

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath the unit tensor and @xmath the unit imaginary number. The
plasma is assumed to be uniform, unbounded and immersed in a uniform
static magnetic field @xmath . For a cold plasma, the equilibrium
velocities of particles are zero, and the equilibrium electric field
vanishes. Therefore, a set of linear equations that govern the plasma
system is formed:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the particle velocity and @xmath is the plasma density.
The subscript @xmath denotes the plasma species, namely electrons and
ions, @xmath denotes the equilibrium values, and @xmath denotes the
small-amplitude perturbations. The linearised current density and
momentum equation are thus:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath and @xmath the particle charge and mass respectively.
Substituting the solved @xmath from Eq. ( 1.6 ) into Eq. ( 1.5 ) and
recalling @xmath , we get the conductivity tensor

  -- -- -- -------
           (1.7)
  -- -- -- -------

where @xmath is the cyclotron frequency. According to Eq. ( 1.3 ), the
dielectric tensor is thereby [ 22 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here, the quantities @xmath (for sum), @xmath (for difference), and
@xmath (for plasma) are defined as:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

and @xmath is the plasma frequency. It will be shown later (through
Eq. ( 1.17 ) and Eq. ( 1.18 )) that the parameters @xmath and @xmath
stand for right-hand circularly polarised (RHCP) and left-hand
circularly polarised (LHCP) modes, respectively. Equations ( 1.8 )- (
1.10 ) represent the well-known cold-plasma dielectric tensor which has
been used widely for plasma wave analyses, and will be employed below to
derive the dispersion relation of helicon waves.

##### Whistlers: unbounded helicon waves

We first study the normal modes of this unbounded plasma system.
Combining Eq. ( 1.1 ) with the Faraday’s law

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

we get the homogeneous-plasma wave equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

which can be written in a more convenient form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

by introducing the dimensionless index of refraction vector @xmath . The
magnitude of @xmath is the ratio of the speed of light @xmath to the
wave phase velocity @xmath , with @xmath the wave number. Without losing
the generality, we choose a 3D Cartesian coordinate system @xmath and
assume @xmath to be in the @xmath plane and @xmath along the @xmath
axis. The angle between @xmath and @xmath is @xmath . Equation ( 1.13 )
can be written in a matrix form [ 22 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

which has nontrivial solutions of @xmath only if the determinant of the
matrix equals zero. The zero-value determinant results in

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

describing the normal modes (no source term in Eq. ( 1.13 )) of the
system. For modes propagating parallel to the static magnetic field,
namely @xmath , the electric field eigenvectors associated with each of
the three roots of Eq. ( 1.15 ) are:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here, the @xmath component of the electric field has been expressed in
form of the @xmath component. Equation ( 1.16 ) represents the electron
plasma oscillations which occur at the plasma frequency according to
Eq. ( 1.10 ), i. e. @xmath ( @xmath ), and do not propagate. This is the
same as that in an unmagnetised plasma because the presence of the
static magnetic field does not affect particle motions (driven by @xmath
) in the parallel direction. This mode is called longitudinal mode due
to the parallel wave vector to the electric field. Equations ( 1.17 )
and ( 1.18 ) represent transverse modes because of @xmath , and from the
phases of @xmath and @xmath we can see that they are RHCP and LHCP
modes, respectively. The dispersion relations of these two modes are
plotted in Fig. 1.1 for a singly ionised argon plasma, as an example,
with density @xmath and field strength @xmath T.

While Fig. 1.1 is the straight visualisation of Eqs. ( 1.17 )-( 1.18 ),
as done by Ginzburg, [ 24 ] the singularity at @xmath is “unreal” and
can be removed by introducing the quasineutral condition of @xmath . In
the fact, for this low frequency range ( @xmath ) of waves, careful
analysis shows that [ 23 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here, @xmath and @xmath are the phase velocity and refraction of index
of Alfvén waves, as labeled in Fig. 1.1 . Branch I is called shear (or
slow) Alfvén waves (SAW), which will be used to form a gap eigenmode in
Chapter 5 . Due to the same direction of the ion cyclotron motion and
wave polarisation, this branch sees the ion cyclotron resonance when
@xmath , forming the so-called ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF)
waves. The ICRF waves have an important role in heating ions in fusion
plasmas. [ 25 ] Similarly, the branch II, named compressional (or fast)
Alfvén waves, sees the electron cyclotron resonance when @xmath ,
because of the same direction of the electron cyclotron motion and wave
polarisation. The electron cyclotron range of frequency (ECRF) waves
have been used widely in studying the energy transport, driving the
current, and diagnosing the radial profile of electron temperature.
Waves polarised in the opposite direction of particle cyclotron motions
do not resonate with these particles, so that the LHCP branch does not
see the electron cyclotron motion and the RHCP branch does not see the
ion cyclotron motion. Branch II is also called whistlers, which for
@xmath are viewed as unbounded helicon waves. [ 18 ] The dispersion
relation of whistlers for @xmath can be obtained by neglecting the ion
terms and assuming @xmath in Eq. ( 1.17 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

which further gives the corresponding group velocity

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

Equation ( 1.21 ) shows that the group velocity of whistlers increases
with the wave frequency. This implies that a received frequency of a
finite duration burst will decrease in tone, leading to the name
“whistler”. It was first observed around the second half of the World
War I, [ 18 ] reported later by Barkhausen in @xmath , [ 26 , 27 ] and
explained by Storey in @xmath . [ 28 ] It can be used to measure the
electron density due to @xmath , and believed to be the only diagnostic
for the electron density at high altitudes above the Earth’s ionosphere,
before direct in situ measurements were available. [ 23 ] Interestingly,
there exists another type of whistlers which, however, have a rising
tone with the increasing time. They occur near the ion cyclotron
frequency on the branch I, and are thereby called ion cyclotron
whistlers. [ 29 ] The ion cyclotron whistlers cannot be observed from
the ground but satellites outside of the ionosphere. [ 23 ]

##### Helicon waves in a cylindrical uniform plasma

When the plasma is bounded, e. g. in a cylindrical geometry, the wave
field of whistlers needs to meet the either conducting or insulating
boundary conditions, and their pure electromagnetic features cannot be
kept. Then they become helicon waves, named after the associated helical
force lines which rotate and carry electrons. [ 18 ] The word “helicon”
was first suggested by Aigrain in @xmath to describe an electromagnetic
wave which propagates in solid metals at low temperatures and with
frequencies @xmath . [ 30 ] The dispersion relation of helicon waves in
a cylindrical plasma with uniform density was first derived by KMT, [ 31
] and more recently by Chen and Arnush. [ 32 , 33 , 34 ] We shall follow
the steps of the latter.

For a cylindrical coordinate system ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ), the
exponential factor changes to @xmath with @xmath the axial wave number
and @xmath the azimuthal mode number. We introduce a total current
@xmath and recall @xmath to get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

which can be equivalently written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here, the relation @xmath (according to Eq. ( 1.9 )) has been used,
@xmath is the conduction or polarisation current, @xmath is the Hall
current or @xmath drift, @xmath is the displacement current, and @xmath
is the unit vector along @xmath . [ 33 ] Assuming that the plasma is
sufficiently dense ( @xmath ) to ensure the ignorable displacement
current compared to the plasma current and the wave frequency is in
range of @xmath to ignore the ion current, [ 35 ] we neglect the ion
terms in Eqs. ( 1.10 ) and get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

Equation ( 1.24 ) results in @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and simplifies
Eq. ( 1.23 ) to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath . Combining Eq. ( 1.25 ) with Eq. ( 1.1 ) (neglect the
vacuum displacement @xmath ) and Eq. ( 1.11 ), we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath . Here, @xmath is the wave number of helicon waves in free
space (namely whistlers according to Eq. ( 1.20 )), and @xmath is the
skin number standing for the decay constant of electromagnetic waves
penetrating into the plasma. Equation ( 1.26 ) can be factored into [ 31
]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath and @xmath the separation constants representing the roots
of

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the limit of @xmath , which yields @xmath , there is only one root of
Eq. ( 1.28 ),

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is the usual dispersion relation of helicon waves in a bounded
uniform plasma. The root @xmath , as will be seen in Eq. ( 1.36 ), is
determined by the boundary condition and the mode structure of @xmath .
Taking the curl of Eq. ( 1.26 ) and employing @xmath , we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

The axial component of Eq. ( 1.30 ) is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

which has the solution

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

due to the finite @xmath at the origin. Here, @xmath is the amplitude
constant, @xmath is the Bessel function of the first kind of order
@xmath , and @xmath . The other two components of @xmath can be obtained
from Eq. ( 1.26 ) ( @xmath ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

Equations ( 1.32 )-( 1.34 ) describe the radial and azimuthal components
of the wave magnetic field, from which we can also compute the electric
wave field through Eq. ( 1.11 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here, the axial component of @xmath vanishes because of @xmath assumed
in Eq. ( 1.25 ), namely @xmath . A conducting boundary requires @xmath
which thereby gives @xmath , while an insulating boundary requires
@xmath . Here, @xmath is the radius of the boundary wall. Neglect the
displacement current in Eq. ( 1.1 ) ( @xmath ) and combine it with Eq. (
1.26 ) ( @xmath ), we get @xmath which implies a vanishing radial
component of @xmath , i. e. @xmath . Hence, there exists a universal
boundary condition for both conducting and insulating boundaries for
@xmath , namely,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

The root @xmath can then be solved from Eq. ( 1.36 ) for a given mode
structure. For the lowest two azimuthal modes, i. e. @xmath and @xmath
which are usually observed in helicon discharges, Eq. ( 1.36 ) gives
@xmath and @xmath , respectively, which also vanishes for @xmath , a
long, thin tube. The lowest root of @xmath is @xmath which yields @xmath
for @xmath . To illustrate the helicon wave, we shall plot the
electromagnetic field line patterns of the @xmath and @xmath modes.
Putting back the exponential factor, we can write the real parts of the
wave field of these two modes as:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

The cross sections of these two modes can be visualised easily by
comparing the radial and azimuthal components in Eq. ( 1.37 ) and Eq. (
1.38 ). For @xmath , we introduce @xmath , and plot the electromagnetic
field line pattern as a function of @xmath . As shown in Fig. 1.2 , the
magnetic field line pattern changes from purely radial to spiral and to
purely circular as @xmath is decreased.

The electric field line pattern shows a reverse trend, consistent with
Faraday’s law. Due to the usually true @xmath in helicon discharges
(inclusion of cylindrical boundary decreases @xmath over the case of
infinite plane wave propagation), [ 36 , 32 ] which implies @xmath and
the dominance of @xmath over @xmath , the best way to excite this mode
is through coupling the @xmath component. Here, @xmath and @xmath stand
for the electrostatic and electromagnetic components, respectively. For
@xmath , we introduce @xmath and set @xmath . Figure 1.3 shows the
corresponding magnetic and electric field line patterns which stay
almost the same with @xmath increased from @xmath to @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath .

The corresponding values of @xmath are: @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath , respectively. As time advances or @xmath increases,
the field line pattern rotates about its centre point but the shape does
not change. To show the variation of wave field strength in radius, we
plot the wave magnetic field over radius for the @xmath and @xmath
modes. Here, all components are normalised to their own maximum values
to show a clear radial structure. Figure 1.4 (a) shows the result of the
@xmath mode, which implies that the profiles of @xmath and @xmath are
overlapped and peak off axis, while the profile of @xmath peaks on axis.

By contrast, for the @xmath mode as shown in Fig. 1.4 (b), the profiles
of @xmath and @xmath peak on axis, while the profile of @xmath peaks off
axis and vanishes at the origin. The difference between Fig. 1.4 (a) and
Fig. 1.4 (b) helps identifying @xmath and @xmath modes in experiments.

Although the approximation of @xmath works for most scenarios of helicon
discharges, the inertia of electrons is found to strongly affect the
high order radial modes. [ 37 ] Actually, it has been verified
experimentally that the inertia of electrons brings in measurable effect
on the dispersion relation of waves whose frequencies are at least as
low as @xmath . [ 38 ] For @xmath , Eq. ( 1.28 ) has two roots according
to the quadratic formula:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

They can be simplified for @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath standing for the helicon mode (same as @xmath , see Eq. (
1.29 )) and @xmath evidently for an electron cyclotron mode (or TG mode,
shortened for the initials of Trivelpiece and Gould who first discussed
it with cylindrical boundaries [ 39 ] ). The solution of Eq. ( 1.27 ) is
eventually the combination of the following two Helmholtz equations:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . A complete boundary condition for Eq. ( 1.41 ) was given
by Chen and Arnush [ 33 ] for a conducting cylinder

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath and @xmath . From Eq. ( 1.42 ), we can solve the two roots
of @xmath and @xmath for a given mode structure, and then obtain the
corresponding dispersion relation.

##### Helicon waves in a cylindrical non-uniform plasma

In this section, we consider a plasma cylinder with radial density
gradient, which is more realistic for helicon discharges than a uniform
density profile that has been used so far. [ 19 ] The effect of the
radial density gradient on helicon discharges was first recognised
experimentally by Lehane and Thonemann [ 40 ] and theoretically by
Blevin and Christiansen [ 36 , 41 ] , and examined in more detail by
Chen and his colleagues. [ 42 , 43 ] Although Blevin and Christiansen
achieved an analytical dispersion relation for a specific radially
non-uniform density profile, most previous studies rely on numerical
computations for arbitrary radial non-uniformity in plasma density. In
@xmath , Breizman and Arefiev presented a theoretical analysis to
explore the effect of the radial density gradient on helicon waves, and
discovered a new surface-type helicon mode. Though their analysis is
based on a step-like radial profile of plasma density, the analytical
dispersion relation they obtained is actually valid for general radially
non-uniform density profiles, as long as the plasma column is long, thin
( @xmath ) and sufficiently dense ( @xmath ). The surface-type helicon
mode is called so because it is caused by a localised “surface” current,
formed by the radial density jump. This radially localised helicon (RLH)
mode may shed light on the high efficiency of helicon wave production of
plasmas. Since the RLH mode will be employed in Chapter 4 to form a gap
eigenmode in a plasma cylinder with periodic magnetic field, a short
overview is given below. [ 35 ]

For @xmath , we rewrite Eqs. ( 1.9 )-( 1.10 ) as:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

and combine Eq. ( 1.1 ) with Eq. ( 1.11 ) to get the linear wave
equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

The three components of Eq. ( 1.44 ) in cylindrical coordinates are:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

For a small longitudinal wave number ( @xmath ) and a sufficiently dense
plasma ( @xmath ), both Eq. ( 1.45 ) and Eq. ( 1.46 ) read

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

As will be shown, the radial nonuniformity of plasma density has a
surprisingly strong effect on the structure of helicon modes with @xmath
, and this effect is most pronounced in the limit of small @xmath
considered here. For @xmath , expanding the quasineutrality ( @xmath )
gives

  -- -- -- --------
           (1.49)
  -- -- -- --------

Equations ( 1.47 )-( 1.49 ) are combined to form a closed set which can
be reduced to:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -- -- --------
           (1.51)
  -- -- -- --------

Here, a new unknown function has been introduced, @xmath , which
measures the radial component of the perturbed magnetic field.
Equations ( 1.50 )-( 1.51 ) indicate two modes: a helicon mode with wave
equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

and a TG mode with wave equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

For the helicon mode, Eq. ( 1.52 ) can be solved for @xmath based on a
step-like radial profile of plasma density

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the corresponding radial profile of electric field

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the radius of the density discontinuity and @xmath is a
constant electric field. Under the limit of @xmath , an analytical
dispersion relation can be obtained

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

The mode involves a perturbed “surface” current which is localised near
the peak of the eigenfunction @xmath and distinguishes it from the modes
studied previously. [ 31 , 44 ] This RLH mode can couple strongly to the
antenna current during helicon discharges.

For comparison, the dispersion relations of whistlers (Eq. ( 1.20 )),
helicon waves (Eq. ( 1.29 )) and the RLH mode (Eq. ( 1.56 )) are plotted
together in Fig. 1.5 .

The plasma parameters employed here are the same to those used for Fig.
1.1 . For helicon waves, the root @xmath in Eq. ( 1.29 ) has been set to
@xmath , taking the lowest root of @xmath . For the RLH mode, a
numerical form factor @xmath has been introduced to Eq. ( 1.56 ), which
then has a new form @xmath , for a Gaussian radial profile of plasma
density. Fitting this new form with the computed dispersion relation
results in @xmath . [ 45 ] Figure 1.5 indicates that the dispersion
curves of these three modes approach to each other when @xmath .

#### 1.1.2 Helicon discharge

A helicon discharge usually refers to a plasma discharge driven by
helicon waves which, as shown in Sec. 1.1 , are RHCP electromagnetic
waves propagating in a bounded magnetised plasma with frequencies
between the ion and electron cyclotron frequencies. [ 18 , 46 ] Although
helicon waves in a cylinder can be either RHCP or LHCP, the former is
often dominant. [ 1 , 47 , 48 , 19 ] A radio frequency (RF) antenna is
usually employed to excite helicon waves and drive the helicon
discharge. [ 49 ] Figure 1.6 shows the schematic of the first RF antenna
(double-saddle) used to successfully drive a helicon discharge, [ 1 ]
together with those of other two widely used RF antennas:
plane-polarised Nagoya Type III [ 2 , 3 ] and twisted Nagoya Type III
(half-turn helical). [ 4 , 5 , 6 ]

The RF antenna is connected to a RF power supply and wrapped around an
insulating chamber (usually a glass tube). The time-varying current on
the antenna wire induces a time-varying magnetic field, which then
induces an electrostatic field in the opposite direction of the current
through Faraday’s law. The induced electrostatic field is nulled by the
build up of space charge. Legs of the antenna opposite to the machine
axis have opposite induced space charge, giving rise to a transverse
electric field. [ 48 ] This transverse field couples the transverse
@xmath mode structure, as shown in Fig. 1.3 ( @xmath ). The spatially
oscillating electric field accelerates free electrons in the neutral gas
and ionises it through collisional (high pressure) and collisionless
(low pressure) heating mechanisms. [ 19 , 50 ] For an inductively
coupled discharge which does not have a static magnetic field, the
formed surface plasma shields the wave field from the antenna and allows
the propagation of waves only within a short distance (known as skin
depth) into the column. [ 12 , 49 ] If, however, an external magnetic
field is applied axially through the plasma column, the dielectric
scalar of the plasma becomes a tensor (see Eqs. ( 1.8 )-( 1.10 )), and
waves of a certain frequency range will be allowed to propagate inside
the plasma and not confined within the skin depth. [ 22 , 18 , 51 ] This
frequency range of waves are typically helicon waves. Because they can
propagate deep inside the plasma, which increases the efficiency of the
wave energy deposition significantly, helicon waves generate plasmas
with densities typically an order higher than the inductively coupled
discharge when operated at similar pressures and input RF powers. [ 52 ]

An enhancement in collision frequency is usually required to fit
experimental data to theoretical calculations for helicon discharges, [
1 , 53 , 54 ] and the high efficiency in helicon wave production of
plasmas has not yet been completely understood. The pursuit of this
understanding has stimulated a large amount of research and promoted the
discovery of various applications using helicon plasma sources. [ 19 ,
50 ] These include, to name a few, processing semiconductor circuits, [
32 , 19 ] plasma propulsion for space travel, [ 55 , 56 , 57 , 58 ] gas
laser media and plasma lenses for high energy particle beam, [ 32 ]
magnetised plasma opening switches, [ 35 ] laser plasma sources, [ 59 ]
and possibly electrodeless beam source and laser accelerator. [ 48 ] The
helicon plasma can be also used as a research tool for measuring Hall
coefficients in semiconductors, [ 60 ] studying Landau and Cherenkov
damping, [ 60 ] measuring Doppler-shifted cyclotron damping, [ 61 ]
studying magnetic fusion, [ 62 ] driving RF current, [ 63 ] , studying
intense-beam plasma interactions, [ 35 ] understanding ionospheric
phenomena, [ 60 , 35 ] and studying Alfvén wave propagations. [ 64 ]

Helicon wave production of plasma was first achieved by Boswell in
@xmath , [ 1 ] following ten years history of helicon propagation study
first in solid state plasmas [ 65 , 66 , 40 ] and then in gaseous
plasmas. [ 67 ] The basic theory of helicon waves was also studied
extensively in the @xmath s. [ 68 , 69 , 31 , 70 , 71 ] The early
history of helicon studies prior to @xmath is reviewed by Boswell and
Chen. [ 18 , 19 ] Two questions remain unresolved: the reason for the
high efficiency of helicon discharges and the dominance of the RHCP mode
over the LHCP mode. [ 19 ] This thesis first models the wave instability
in helicon plasmas with consideration of plasma flows, which have been
observed recently in multiple helicon devices. [ 8 , 72 ] Second, the
thesis studies the propagation of helicon waves inside a pinched plasma
and supports the hypothesis that multiple radial modes could be excited
simultaneously, [ 48 , 73 , 74 , 75 ] which may contribute to the
understanding of the “strangely” high efficiency. Due to the robust
field line patterns of @xmath mode, which does not vary with axial
position as discussed in Sec. 1.1.1 , helicon waves (particularly the
RLH mode) will be utilised to form a gap eigenmode in the downstream
region of a helicon discharge.

### 1.2 Magnetic geometry

The magnetic geometry of plasma confinement varies from uniform to
focused, diverged, rippled, toroidal, dipolar, irregular et al.,
depending on the specific applications. Here, we consider four
geometries: uniform as typically used for the helicon discharge, focused
to get a pinched plasma for material processing, rippled to form a
spectral gap and a gap eigenmode through breaking the periodicity
locally, and toroidal mainly for magnetic confinement fusion where the
gap eigenmode found in the rippled field has applications.

#### 1.2.1 Uniform: WOMBAT

For a uniform magnetic geometry, we consider the WOMBAT, [ 20 ] which
was designed to provide a plasma environment to study wave physics
including chaos, turbulence, wave saturation and the related driving
mechanisms. This device will be employed in Chapter 2 for investigating
drift waves in a flowing plasma cylinder. [ 76 ] Figure 1.7 shows a
schematic and the employed magnetic field.

It comprises a glass source tube and a large stainless steel diffusion
chamber, which are attached to each other on axis. The source tube is
@xmath cm long and @xmath cm in diameter, while the diffusion chamber is
@xmath cm long and @xmath cm in inner diameter. A large solenoid is
employed inside the diffusion chamber to provide a steady magnetic
field, which can be up to @xmath T and highly uniform along the axis. To
generate the plasma, a single loop antenna ( @xmath cm in diameter,
@xmath cm wide and @xmath cm thick) surrounding the source tube coupled
the RF power to the argon gas. The @xmath MHz electric current passing
through the loop creates a time varying magnetic field, which in turn
induces azimuthal current in the argon gas and leads to break down and
formation of the plasma. [ 60 ] The base pressure of the diffusion
chamber was maintained at @xmath Torr by a turbomolecular pump and a
rotary pump. In this work, the large solenoid was used to produce a high
density blue core in the diffusion chamber. The dispersion relation of
resistive drift waves, different from that of helicon waves shown in
Eq. ( 1.20 ), Eq. ( 1.29 ) and Eq. ( 1.56 ), is given in Eq. ( 2.12 )
coming from a two-fluid model. [ 77 , 78 ]

The PCEN (Plasma CENtrifuge [ 79 ] ), for which a two-fluid
electrostatic flowing plasma model (used in Chapter 2 ) was developed, [
77 ] is a typical vacuum arc centrifuge designed for separating metal
isotopes. It also employs a uniform magnetic field but with faster
normalised rotation frequency, higher temperature and higher axial
velocity than those of the WOMBAT. Moreover, the plasma source is not a
helicon discharge but a DC discharge, namely the plasma is generated by
a discharge between cathode plate and anode mesh. A schematic of the
PCEN can be found in [ 77 ] .

#### 1.2.2 Focused: MAGPIE

To illustrate a focused magnetic geometry, the MAGPIE is employed. It is
a linear plasma-material interaction machine which was recently built in
the Plasma Research Laboratory at the Australian National University,
and designed for studying basic plasma phenomena, testing materials in
near-fusion plasma conditions, and developing potential diagnostics
applicable for the edge regions of a fusion reactor. [ 8 ] Similar to
other helicon devices, [ 46 ] MAGPIE mainly consists of a dielectric
glass tube surrounded by an antenna, a vacuum pumping system, and a gas
feeding system, together with a power supply system connected to the
antenna, and various diagnostics. Figure 1.8 shows a schematic and the
employed magnetic field, and introduces a cylindrical ( @xmath , @xmath
, @xmath ) coordinate system. The plasma is formed in the region under
the antenna ( @xmath m) and the near field to the antenna. [ 74 ]
Following convention, however, we define the whole glass tube ( @xmath
m) as the source region and the compressed field region ( @xmath m) as
the target region (or equivalently “diffusion region” in some
references). In MAGPIE, the @xmath m region is named “upstream” and
@xmath m “downstream”.

A glass tube of length @xmath m and radius @xmath m is used to contain
source plasmas in MAGPIE. A left hand half-turn helical antenna, @xmath
m in length and @xmath m in radius, is wrapped around the tube and
connected to a tuning box which can be adjusted between @xmath and
@xmath MHz, a directional coupler, a @xmath kW RF amplifier, and a
@xmath W pre-amplifying unit. For the study presented in Chapter 3 , a
RF power of @xmath kW, a frequency of @xmath MHz, a pulse width of
@xmath ms and a duty circle of @xmath % is used. The antenna current is
measured by a Rogowski-coil-type current monitor. For these experiments
an antenna current of magnitude @xmath A was measured. A grounded
stainless steel cylindrical mesh surrounding the whole source region is
employed to protect users. The source region is connected on-axis to the
aluminium target chamber which is @xmath m in length and @xmath m in
radius. Gases are fed through the downstream end of the target chamber,
and drawn to the upstream end of the source tube by a @xmath L/s turbo
pump. Gas pressures are measured in the target chamber by a hot cathode
Bayard-Alpert Ionization gauge ( @xmath Pa), a Baratron pressure gauge (
@xmath – @xmath Pa) and a Convectron ( @xmath Pa– @xmath kPa). In this
experiment, argon gas is used with a filling pressure of @xmath Pa. The
two regions, source and target, are surrounded by a set of water cooled
solenoids, with internal radius of @xmath m. These source and target
sets of solenoids are powered by two independent @xmath A, @xmath V DC
power supplies, providing flexibility in the axial configuration of the
static magnetic field, e. g. maximum of @xmath T and @xmath T in the
source and target regions, respectively. The non-uniform field
configuration is expected to provide a flexible degree of radial
confinement, better plasma transport from the source tube to the target
chamber, and possible increased plasma density according to previous
studies. [ 8 , 18 , 47 , 19 , 80 , 81 ] Wave propagations in the pinched
plasma of the MAGPIE will be studied in Chapter 3 . [ 54 ]

#### 1.2.3 Rippled: LAPD

We use the LAPD to illustrate a rippled magnetic geometry. The LAPD is a
large, linear plasma research device designed to study space plasma
processes, [ 9 ] and more recently fusion research. It is ideal for
studying the fundamental properties of plasmas on a large scale length,
e. g. propagation of low frequency whistlers and SAW. [ 9 , 10 ] As
shown in Fig. 1.9 , the LAPD consists of four stainless-steel chamber
sections, each of which is mounted on a wheeled platform to allow
separate maintenance.

The diameter and length of the machine are @xmath m and @xmath m,
respectively. [ 10 ] The first bell-shaped section mounts a heater, a
cathode and an anode. The heater is made of hollow alumina ceramic tubes
which are threaded with tungsten filaments. This special design is
expected to provide a uniform heating for the cathode with temperature
slightly above the cathode emission temperature. When applied a negative
voltage, the heated cathode emits electrons through both the thermionic
electron emission and the DC discharge (towards the anode). The emitted
electrons then go through the grid anode and ionise the neutral gas
filled in the system, forming a plasma column along the system’s axis.
The plasma column is @xmath m long and with densities up to @xmath . [ 9
] Radial expansions of the plasma are confined by an externally applied
magnetic field, which is generated by a set of @xmath magnet coils
surrounding the chamber, as shown in Fig. 1.9 . The field strength can
be up to @xmath T, and varied with axial position by varying the current
on each of the magnet coils, making it capable to configure a periodic
array of magnetic mirrors. [ 10 ] Therefore, the LAPD is a promising
device for identifying a spectral gap of plasma waves, and also an
appropriate candidate for observing a gap eigenmode. [ 45 ] Discussions
about identifying the gap eigenmodes of RLH waves and SAW will be given
in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 , respectively. Moreover, there are @xmath
radial ports on the vacuum chamber thus providing excellent access for
diagnostics. [ 9 ]

#### 1.2.4 Toroidal: tokamak

Finally, a toroidal magnetic geometry is illustrated in term of a
tokamak. Controlled thermonuclear fusion can be an environmentally
attractive and sustainable energy source, providing a large scale
base-load power. [ 82 ] However, realising the controlled thermonuclear
fusion faces many challenges, which in science is the combined
requirement of confining a sufficient quantity of plasma for a
sufficiently long time at a sufficiently high temperature to make net
fusion power. The Lawson criterion formulates this requirement
specifically as @xmath s keV, with @xmath and @xmath the peak ion
density and temperature in the plasma and @xmath the energy confinement
time. [ 83 , 84 ] We focus on the magnetic confinement fusion (MCF): the
most achievable scheme. To avoid the loss of charged particles parallel
to the magnetic field line, the magnetic field is usually shaped into a
torus. A tokamak is an axisymmetric torus with a poloidal magnetic field
that is produced by a toroidal electric current flowing inside the
plasma, and a very strong longitudinal field parallel to the current. [
85 ] The word “tokamak” is a transliteration from an acronym of Russian
words: to roidalnaya ka mera and ma gnitnaya k atushka, meaning
“toroidal chamber” and “magnetic coils”. [ 84 ] Figure 1.10 shows a
schematic of the tokamak: two components of the magnetic field (poloidal
and toroidal) forming a helical magnetic field nest confining the plasma
torus.

The world’s largest tokamak is being under construction at the Cadarache
facility in the south of France: International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor (ITER), which aims to demonstrate the scientific
and technological feasibility of producing commercial energy from the
controlled thermonuclear fusion. It is designed to produce @xmath MW of
fusion power from @xmath MW of input power, with the energy gain of
@xmath . [ 86 ]

Given that fusion plasmas are energetically rich, complex exothermic
physical systems, charged particles can still be lost even if the
toroidal magnetic configuration is perfectly designed. Populations of
charged particles can be accelerated well above thermal speeds through
processes such as resonant wave absorption, charge exchange with
injected high energy neutral beams, magnetic reconnection, and the
fusion process itself. The importance of these energetic populations is
that they can drive electromagnetic waves which, in turn, can eject the
same driving particles from confinement. [ 87 ] The most easily excited
modes usually reside in their spectral gaps, which are formed by the
various periodicities in the toroidally confined plasma. [ 21 ] These
gap eigenmodes are introduced by symmetry-breaking due to toroidicity,
plasma ellipticity and higher order shaping effects. Therefore, it is of
practical interest to study the formation of gap eigenmodes and their
interactions with energetic particles. We shall investigate two types of
gap eigenmodes: RLH waves in the whistler frequency range, which can be
driven unstable by energetic electrons, [ 45 ] and SAW with frequency
below the ion cyclotron frequency, which can be excited by energetic
ions in tokamaks.

### 1.3 Aims of the thesis

The aim of thesis is to study the impact of magnetic geometry on
spontaneous and driven wave modes in cylindrical helicon-source plasmas.
Three questions will be addressed:

(1) what are the plasma-driven wave modes in a rotating, flowing plasma
with uniform magnetic field?

(2) how do wave propagation characteristics of antenna-driven modes
change with ramping magnetic field, and can this non-uniformity enhance
the plasma density?

(3) can gap eigenmodes be formed in a plasma cylinder with rippled
magnetic field, by breaking the field periodicity locally?

## Chapter 2 Drift waves in a uniformly magnetised plasma with flows

A two-fluid model developed originally to describe wave oscillations in
the vacuum arc centrifuge, a cylindrical, rapidly rotating, low
temperature and confined plasma column, is applied to interpret plasma
oscillations in a RF generated linear magnetised plasma (WOMBAT) with
similar density and field strength. Compared to typical centrifuge
plasmas, WOMBAT plasmas have slower normalised rotation frequency, lower
temperature and lower axial velocity. Despite these differences, the
two-fluid model provides a consistent description of the WOMBAT plasma
configuration and yields qualitative agreement between measured and
predicted wave oscillation frequencies with axial field strength. In
addition, the radial profile of the density perturbation predicted by
this model is consistent with the data. Parameter scans show that the
dispersion curve is sensitive to the axial field strength and the
electron temperature, and the dependence of oscillation frequency with
electron temperature matches the experiment. These results consolidate
earlier claims that the density and floating potential oscillations are
a resistive drift mode, driven by the density gradient. To our
knowledge, this is the first detailed physics model of flowing plasmas
in the diffusion region away from the RF source. Possible extensions to
the model, including temperature non-uniformity and magnetic field
oscillations, are also discussed.

### 2.1 Introduction

Oscillations have been observed in the electric probe signals of many
laboratory plasmas, including theta pinches, [ 88 , 89 ] magnetic
mirrors, [ 90 , 91 , 92 ] Q machines, [ 93 ] vacuum arc centrifuge [ 94
] and helicon plasmas. [ 95 , 96 , 97 , 98 , 99 ] Theta pinches and
magnetic mirrors behave vastly different from the latter because of
their high beta and significant magnetic curvature, which result in
highly different plasma and field geometry. In contrast, Q machine,
plasma centrifuge and helicon plasmas have low beta and negligible
magnetic curvature, and have similar plasma properties. We exploit this
similarity by deploying a two-fluid collisional model, initially
developed to describe vacuum arc centrifuge plasmas, to describe the
configuration and oscillations in a helicon plasma. Our goal is to
better describe a class of electrostatic oscillations observed, but not
yet conclusively identified, in the diffusion region of helicon plasmas,
away from the RF source.

The helicon plasma we study is provided by the WOMBAT device, whose
schematic has been given in Fig. 1.7 . The WOMBAT has been used to study
helicon waves, [ 100 , 97 , 11 ] which have attracted great interest in
the past decades due to their ability to produce high plasma densities.
[ 101 ] Such plasmas also provide a rich environment for the
experimental study of drift waves and their impact on anomalous
transport, [ 102 ] which is important to understand in fusion plasmas.
Although there have been many publications on helicon wave physics, less
attention has been devoted to the physics of low frequency oscillations
in the diffusion region away from the source. [ 103 ] Light et al. [ 104
, 105 ] observed a low frequency electrostatic instability only above a
critical magnetic field and identified it as a mixture of drift waves
and a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Degeling et al. [ 97 , 106 ]
observed relaxation oscillations in the kilohertz range that were
associated with the various types of mode coupling in helicon
discharges. More recently, a cylindrical linear model which treats
global eigenmodes [ 107 ] has been employed to study drift waves in the
magnetically confined plasma device VINETA, [ 103 , 102 , 108 ] however,
the model does not involve the @xmath rotation and neglects ion parallel
motion which may influence the characteristics of low frequency
oscillations. [ 109 ] Sun et al. [ 99 ] observed low frequency ( @xmath
kHz) oscillations near the end of helicon source region, and identified
them as resistive-drift Alfvén waves. Sutherland et al. [ 110 ] observed
low frequency ion cyclotron waves that were highly localised along the
axial center of the WOMBAT plasma device. Their analysis of spectral
measurements suggested the possible existence of a four wave
interaction, where energy is down-converted to the ion cyclotron mode
from the helicon pump.

Low frequency oscillations in helicon plasmas can be broadly classified
into two types: the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and drift waves. The
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is driven by a velocity shear in a mass
flow or a velocity difference across the interface between two fluids. [
111 ] This can occur in helicon plasmas, because the streaming velocity
of the ion fluid is much slower than that of electrons. The drift wave
is a universal instability driven by a plasma pressure gradient
perpendicular to the ambient field. [ 12 ] It can arise in fully
ionised, magnetically confined and low-beta plasmas, [ 112 ] and has
been observed in both linear and toroidal field geometries. [ 113 , 114
, 115 , 116 , 117 ] In WOMBAT plasmas, the velocity shear is small and
the density and temperature gradients produce large pressure gradients,
suggestive of large drive of drift waves. We thus restrict attention to
this class of modes.

In this chapter, a two-fluid model, which was developed originally for
the vacuum arc centrifuge by Hole et al. [ 77 , 118 ] to explain
oscillations observed in the density and electric potential, is applied
to study low frequency oscillations observed in the WOMBAT. We show that
the equilibrium and perturbed density profiles and the space potential
profile from the model and data are consistent. The model predicts
unstable modes with a similar global mode radial structure, and a
frequency comparable to observed signals. The chapter is organised as
follows: Sec. 2.2 gives a brief description of the diagnostics on
WOMBAT, together with typically measured parameters, Sec. 2.3 introduces
the two-fluid model and Sec. 2.4 discusses the wave physics revealed by
this model and the data. Finally, Sec. 2.5 discusses the possible
extensions to this model and presents concluding remarks.

### 2.2 Diagnostics and measured parameters

To measure spatial and temporal profiles in the plasma, an
uncompensated, translating Langmuir probe was inserted radially into the
diffusion chamber, 50 cm from the source and diffusion chamber
interface. The central wire of the probe was fed through an alumina
support which was in turn shielded by a 6 mm diameter grounded steel
tubing covering the whole extent of the probe length up to the probe
tips. The removable probe tip was made of a @xmath mm diameter and 8 mm
long nickel wire. Radial translation of the probe was set using a
computer controlled stepper motor arrangement that allowed the probe tip
position to be selected with an accuracy of a few micrometers. To
determine the plasma @xmath characteristics, the bias voltage on the
Langmuir probe was swept between @xmath V and @xmath V using a Labview
program. The plasma density ( @xmath ), electron temperature ( @xmath ),
plasma potential ( @xmath ) and floating potential ( @xmath ) were
determined from the @xmath characteristics of the cylindrical probe. For
the present high-density plasma discharge, the effect that RF
fluctuations have on the floating potential, and hence the @xmath
characteristics, was found to be negligible. The reproducibility for
@xmath was within @xmath eV, and the signal-to-noise ratio was improved
by averaging many @xmath curves. The effect that fluctuations due to
waves will have on time-averaged @xmath characteristics will be far more
dominant than the RF fluctuations. These wave fluctuations would lead to
error magnification in the second derivative of the @xmath curve and
hence the electron energy distribution function. For this reason, the
plasma parameters were obtained directly from the @xmath curve and not
by the Druyvesteyn method. [ 119 ]

Typical Langmuir probe measurements of WOMBAT argon plasmas are shown in
Table 2.1 .

Other parameters, obtained for similar helicon plasmas, [ 120 , 72 ] and
measured by laser induced fluorescence, include: the ion temperature
@xmath , the bulk rotation frequency @xmath , and axial streaming
velocity @xmath . The parameter @xmath is the argon ion mass and the
charge number @xmath is taken to match similar argon plasma conditions.
[ 121 ] The remaining parameters are introduced in section 2.3 . The
antenna driving frequency is @xmath MHz, which is much higher than the
bulk rotation frequency and wave frequency. Finally, plasma parameters
for the PCEN device are taken from published work. [ 79 , 77 ] It should
be noted that the operating gas in the PCEN work is magnesium while here
it is argon.

### 2.3 Plasma model

#### 2.3.1 Model assumptions

The two-fluid model developed by Hole et al. [ 77 , 78 ] is based on the
following plasma assumptions:

(1) Ions of different charge can be treated as a single species with
average charge @xmath .

(2) The plasma is quasi-neutral, giving that @xmath .

(3) The steady-state plasma is azimuthally symmetric and has no axial
structure.

(4) The effects induced by plasma fluctuations on the externally applied
field can be neglected.

(5) Both finite Larmor radius (FLR) and viscosity effects are
negligible.

(6) For the range of frequencies considered here, the electron inertia
can be neglected.

(7) The ion and electron temperatures, @xmath and @xmath , are uniform
across the plasma column.

(8) The steady-state ion density distribution has a form of @xmath ,
which is a Gaussian profile. Here, @xmath is the on-axis ion density,
and @xmath is the characteristic radius at which the density is @xmath
of its on-axis value.

(9) The steady-state velocities of ions and electrons can be written as
@xmath and @xmath , respectively, where @xmath is the ion rigid rotor
rotation frequency, @xmath is the ion uniform axial streaming velocity,
@xmath is the electron rotation frequency, and @xmath is the electron
streaming velocity. While treated in other work [ 78 ] , radial
diffusion of both ions and electrons due to electron-ion collision is
negligible.

Here, length and time are normalised to @xmath and @xmath respectively.
A normalised cylindrical coordinate system is then developed, with
@xmath and @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath are the normalised radial
and axial positions, respectively.

#### 2.3.2 Two-fluid equations

The model comprises the motion and continuity equations of ion and
electron fluids, written respectively as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

with terms defined as follows:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Here, subscript @xmath and @xmath refer to ion and electron parameters
respectively, @xmath is the normalised radial velocity divided by @xmath
, @xmath is the normalised rotation frequency, @xmath indicates the
normalised axial velocity, @xmath is the ratio between ion and electron
temperatures, @xmath is a convenient constant which for @xmath becomes
the square of the normalised ion thermal velocity, @xmath is a
normalised electric potential @xmath , @xmath is the logarithm of the
ratio of the ion density @xmath to its on-axis value @xmath , and @xmath
is the ratio of the electron-ion collision frequency @xmath to its
on-axis value @xmath . Also, @xmath is the normalised resistivity
parallel to the magnetic field, where @xmath is the electrical
resistivity of a Lorentz gas and @xmath is the ratio of the conductivity
of a charge state @xmath to that in a Lorentz gas. [ 122 ]

#### 2.3.3 Steady-state solution

In cylindrical geometry with a purely axial constant field @xmath , the
steady-state solution of this model is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

with

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is an arbitrary reference potential. The axial current in
this model is unconstrained, and can arbitrarily be set to zero ( @xmath
), consistent with WOMBAT boundary conditions.

We have compared the steady-state solution to experimental data.
Measurements of the fluctuation frequency from probe measurements
suggest rigid rotation, which is consistent with the spectroscopic data
obtained by Scime et al .. [ 72 ] Figure 2.1 (a) shows the equilibrium
density profile of the WOMBAT plasma for two different axial field
strengths, @xmath T and @xmath T, respectively. [ 11 ]

Overlaid are best fits to the profile using a Gaussian profile ( @xmath
): these show reasonable agreement over the range of the data. The
stronger field produces better confinement with a smaller characteristic
radius @xmath . Figure 2.1 (b) shows the radial variation of the space
potential in WOMBAT for a slightly different field strength, @xmath T. [
7 ] Overlaid is a best fit to the data using the parabolic potential
profile in Eq. ( 2.5 ), with the arbitrary reference potential ( @xmath
) and gradient @xmath free parameters. Although the fit, for which
@xmath , is reasonable, the scatter in the data is large. For the same
@xmath , we have over plotted the model potential profile with @xmath .
Within the bulk of the plasma, out to the characteristic radius @xmath
m, model and observed potential profiles broadly agree. Figure 2.1 (c)
shows the radial profile of @xmath in the WOMBAT plasma. [ 11 ] The
constant electron temperature of the model is an approximation to the
radially varying experimental profile. For the model, we have chosen the
@xmath value at the position at which the frequency was determined,
@xmath cm.

#### 2.3.4 Normal mode analysis

To compute the normal modes of the system, Hole et al. [ 77 ] apply a
linear perturbation treatment with plasma parameters @xmath taking the
form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here, @xmath is the perturbation parameter, @xmath the azimuthal mode
number, @xmath the axial wave number and @xmath the angular frequency.
We consider a complex value of @xmath so as to study both the mode
frequency and growth rate, i. e. @xmath . To first order in @xmath the
system of Eq. ( 2.1 )-( 2.4 ) reduces to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the matrix

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here, @xmath is the frequency in the frame of the ion fluid, @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath and we have introduced a new dependent variable @xmath ,
where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

For large axial wavelength modes of the resistive plasma column, for
which @xmath , this model can be reduced to a second order differential
equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and @xmath with the normalised axial wave number @xmath . For odd @xmath
modes, the boundary conditions for Eq. ( 2.11 ) are @xmath and @xmath
with the infinite radius @xmath representing the edge of plasma column.
For even @xmath , these conditions become @xmath and @xmath . We seek
unstable solutions to Eq. ( 2.11 ), for which @xmath . The solutions
@xmath are stable and hence discarded.

### 2.4 Wave physics

The experimental results indicate that a @xmath drift wave mode
dominates the density fluctuations, and that the mode appears to
propagate purely azimuthally in direction of the electron diamagnetic
drift. [ 123 ] There is no clear radial component of the mode
propagation. The observed phase velocity of the mode is approximately
@xmath m/s in the region of maximum density perturbation.

#### 2.4.1 Dispersion curve

As in Hole et al. , [ 77 ] we have solved Eq. ( 2.11 ) by a shooting
method but using our new code written in Mathematica. For @xmath the
boundary conditions are @xmath . As the differential equation is
homogeneous, the gradient at the edge @xmath is arbitrary: we have
chosen @xmath . To solve for given @xmath , we choose a trial @xmath and
march the solution from the edge to the core. The complex frequency
@xmath is then adjusted until the on-axis boundary condition is
satisfied. We commence the procedure at @xmath , for which an analytical
solution for @xmath is available. This is found from the solution to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the number of radial nodes in the plasma. Figure 2.2
shows the dispersion curve for the plasma conditions of the PCEN in
Table 2.1 .

We have compared the dispersion curve to Hole et al. , [ 77 ] and found
it to be identical, thus validating our numerics. For PCEN plasmas, the
peak of normalised growth rate @xmath lies at @xmath , with normalised
frequency @xmath : the wave is thus near stationary in the frame of the
ion fluid. The mode crossings located at @xmath are associated with the
centrifugal instability. Also shown is the dispersion curve for WOMBAT
plasma conditions of Table 2.1 . For WOMBAT plasmas, the peak growth
rate of @xmath occurs at @xmath , for which @xmath . There is no mode
crossing in the dispersion curve for WOMBAT plasmas. Also, @xmath , and
so in the laboratory frame @xmath , approximately @xmath , such that the
frequency of unstable waves is always larger than the sum of the plasma
rotation frequency and axial velocity, and the wave propagates in the
@xmath direction (electron diamagnetic drift direction). We attribute
the difference between dispersion curves to the very low ion temperature
@xmath and slow normalised rotation frequency @xmath in WOMBAT plasmas,
compared with PCEN plasmas. Indeed, this can be seen by varying the
parameters from PCEN to WOMBAT conditions. If @xmath is held fixed and
@xmath lowered, the growth rate drops linearly with @xmath , and the
dispersion curve shifts to lower @xmath . Conversely, if @xmath is held
fixed and @xmath lowered, the dispersion curve expands to higher @xmath
, and the growth rate drops. Thus, the decrease in growth rate is due to
both the decrease in rotation and temperature, while the expansion of
the dispersion curve to higher @xmath is due to the lower temperature.
The corresponding increase in @xmath at low @xmath occurs because as
rotation drops, the Doppler shifted frequency, @xmath , increases.

#### 2.4.2 Dispersion curve sensitivity with plasma parameters

We have examined the sensitivity of the WOMBAT plasma dispersion curve
with @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . For @xmath the dispersion curve
changes by less than @xmath . Figure 2.3 shows the change in dispersion
curve for different @xmath and @xmath .

Figure 2.3 (a), (b) shows that @xmath and @xmath decrease with
increasing @xmath : the physical growth rate @xmath also obeys this
trend while @xmath exhibits the same trend in the range @xmath . Also,
the peak growth rate shifts to lower @xmath , and so for constant @xmath
the axial wavelength of the most unstable mode is increased. In
contrast, Fig. 2.3 (c), (d) shows that @xmath and @xmath increase with
increasing @xmath , and the peak growth rate shifts to larger @xmath .
The dependence of growth rate with pressure gradient, and frequency with
inverse field strength is consistent with a resistive drift wave. [ 12 ]

#### 2.4.3 Wave oscillation frequency with @xmath and @xmath

In this section we compute the variation in wave frequency at the
maximum growth rate with field strength, for two choices of electron
temperature: a constant @xmath eV, independent of @xmath ; and a @xmath
dependent @xmath . As @xmath data is only available at two field
strengths (Fig. 2.1 (c)): @xmath T, @xmath eV; and @xmath T, @xmath eV,
we have used linear interpolation to compute @xmath at other field
strengths. Fluctuation data is available at five field strengths: @xmath
T, @xmath T, @xmath T, @xmath T and @xmath T. We have solved the
dispersion curve for each case, and selected @xmath corresponding to the
maximum @xmath to calculate the frequency in the laboratory frame. The
maximum error in the electron temperature measurements is @xmath eV
which was determined from the reproducibility of the experimental
measurements. This is also the minimum temperature that we could
measure.

Figure 2.4 shows the measured and predicted oscillation frequencies.

For both curves, the predicted and measured frequencies differ by a
factor of @xmath . There are various possible reasons for this gap. The
most likely is that the model assumes flat @xmath and @xmath profiles,
whereas WOMBAT plasmas exhibit a non-uniform @xmath profile. It may also
be the case that the @xmath profile is non-uniform. Second, there may be
slip between the rotation of WOMBAT plasmas and the oscillation
frequency. Third, we have neglected the fluctuations in the magnetic
field, which may affect the dispersion curve. Finally, the calculation
of @xmath for each @xmath is a linear interpretation between the two
known data, which may bring errors and imprecisions into the prediction.
Figure 2.4 also reveals that two trends predicted by using a constant
@xmath eV and a @xmath dependent @xmath are divergent. Predictions for
the @xmath dependent @xmath profile exhibit the same trend as the data,
suggesting the model may have correctly captured the @xmath dependence
with @xmath . Finally, to ensure that this model is in principle capable
to reproduce the data, we adjusted @xmath to fit the data points. We
found that a value of @xmath eV at low field dropping to @xmath eV at
high field was able to reproduce the observed frequency.

#### 2.4.4 Perturbed density profile

Figure 2.5 shows the measured and predicted radial profiles of the
perturbed density @xmath , together with the equilibrium density
gradient @xmath .

The data used here were taken under the conditions of @xmath T, @xmath
cm and @xmath eV. The linear perturbation treatment gives no solution
for the absolute magnitude of @xmath , and so we have fitted for the
amplitude. Inspection of Fig. 2.5 suggests @xmath has a single peak, and
therefore consistent with @xmath of the perturbed mode. Also, the peak
of the eigenfunction occurs in the region where the equilibrium density
gradient is large, suggesting that the instability has resistive
drift-type characteristics. [ 112 ] The exact radial position of the
peak in @xmath however does not agree. This could be due to uncertainty
in the core position of the plasma, or the assumption of constant @xmath
in the model.

Finally, to complement our visualisation of the mode structure, we have
computed the vector field of the linear perturbed mass flow by @xmath .
The perturbed velocity components @xmath , @xmath and perturbed density
@xmath can be computed from the solution of @xmath and following
equations:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

Figure 2.6 shows the flow vector field at time @xmath .

As time advances, the mass flow vector field rotates in the clockwise
direction, which is the direction of electron diamagnetic drift with
@xmath into the page. Here, the coordinate @xmath and @xmath label the
cross-section of the plasma, with @xmath and @xmath . The @xmath vector
points clockwise with @xmath into the page. The mass flow is zero on
axis ( @xmath ), consistent with the boundary conditions for density.
The symmetric mass flow represents a flow around a stagnant core, with
the largest flow in regions of peak density gradient. While we have only
studied linear oscillatory response in this work, a similar nonlinear
flow pattern may contribute to rotation damping.

### 2.5 Conclusions

In this chapter, we employed a two-fluid model, which was developed
originally for describing the wave oscillations observed in PCEN, [ 77 ,
78 , 118 ] to study the low frequency oscillations in WOMBAT. To ensure
that this model is consistent with WOMBAT, the measured and predicted
plasma configurations were compared, including the equilibrium density
profile and the space potential profile. These show that although the
density and space potential profiles agree, the temperature profile is
not flat, as assumed by the model. Next, dispersion curves were
generated for WOMBAT plasmas. Compared to the more rapidly rotating
centrifuge plasma, the drift wave instability, unstable at larger
wavelengths, has a normalised frequency much larger than the normalised
frequency for the centrifuge. The difference between dispersion curves
is principally due to the low rotation speed of WOMBAT plasmas compared
to those of the centrifuge.

Our study of the wave oscillation frequency with @xmath and @xmath
reveals that the measured fluctuation frequency is a factor of @xmath
lower than the predicted frequency, and the predicted trend of
oscillation frequency with @xmath for inferred @xmath matches the data.
The discrepancy between the measured and predicted fluctuation
frequencies may be attributable to the limitations of assumed
temperature uniformity across plasma column. Weaker model limitations
may be our neglect of effects induced by plasma fluctuations on the
externally applied field. These effects are included in a TwO-fluid
Electromagnetic Flowing pLasma (TOEFL) model developed in Appendix A.3 ,
for which, however, the computation has not yet been finished. Data
limitations include the simultaneous measurements of plasma rotation
profile and probe frequency, and the measured dependency of @xmath with
@xmath .

Finally, we find that the measured and predicted perturbed density
profiles have a single peak in the radial direction, indicating the
perturbed mode has @xmath , and the peak position is in the region of
maximum equilibrium density gradient. This qualitative agreement
consolidates earlier claims that the mode is a drift mode, driven by the
density gradient of the plasma. To our knowledge, this is the first
detailed physics model of flowing plasmas in the diffusion region away
from the RF source.

## Chapter 3 Wave propagations in a pinched plasma

A RF field solver [ 124 ] based on Maxwell’s equations and a cold plasma
dielectric tensor is employed to describe wave phenomena observed in a
cylindrical non-uniform helicon discharge. The experiment is carried out
on a recently built linear plasma-material interaction machine: the
MAGPIE (see Fig. 1.8 ), [ 8 ] in which both plasma density and static
magnetic field are functions of axial position. The field strength
increases by a factor of @xmath from source to target plate, and the
plasma density and electron temperature are radially non-uniform. With
an enhancement factor of @xmath to the electron-ion Coulomb collision
frequency, a @xmath reduction in the antenna radius, and the same other
conditions as employed in the experiment, the solver produces axial and
radial profiles of wave amplitude and phase that are consistent with
measurements. A numerical study on the effects of axial gradient in
plasma density and static magnetic field on wave propagations is
performed, revealing that the helicon wave has weaker attenuation away
from the antenna in a focused field compared to a uniform field. This
may be consistent with observations of increased ionization efficiency
and plasma production in a non-uniform field. We find that the
relationship between plasma density, static magnetic field strength and
axial wavelength agrees well with a simple theory developed previously.
A numerical scan of the enhancement factor to the electron-ion Coulomb
collision frequency from @xmath to @xmath shows that the wave amplitude
is lowered and the power deposited into the core plasma decreases as the
enhancement factor increases, possibly due to the stronger edge heating
for higher collision frequencies.

### 3.1 Introduction

To date, most helicon studies have treated devices with uniform static
magnetic fields, however, many applications require operation with axial
magnetic field variations. [ 73 ] A few researchers have investigated
helicon plasma sources with non-uniform magnetic fields, and have found
that the plasma density increased when a cusp or non-uniform magnetic
field was placed in the vicinity of the helicon antenna. [ 18 , 47 , 19
, 80 ] However, detailed examination of the reasons for this enhanced
plasma density has not yet been conducted, although fast electrons and
improved confinement are mentioned as possible contributors. Guo et al.
[ 81 ] furthered this study by looking at the effects of non-uniform
magnetic field on source operations, and found that a strong axial
gradient in density associated with non-uniform field configuration can
contribute to the absorption of wave fields and a high ionization
efficiency. Takechi et al. [ 125 ] also suggested that there may be a
close relationship between plasma density profile and RF wave
propagation and absorption regions, finding the density uniformity in
the radial direction improved markedly with the cusp field. Therefore,
studying the effects of various static magnetic field configurations on
helicon wave propagation is of significant importance to producing
desired plasma profiles and understanding the role of magnetic field in
helicon plasma generations.

This chapter is dedicated to modelling the wave field observed in
MAGPIE, and investigating helicon wave propagation in the non-uniform
magnetised plasma of this machine, in which both the static magnetic
field and its associated plasma density are functions of axial position.
The plasma density and electron temperature are also dependent on
radius. Independent measurements of electron temperature @xmath in
MAGPIE at lower field and power conditions show that @xmath does not
change substantially along @xmath . We have thus assumed @xmath is
independent of @xmath in the present study. The static magnetic field is
almost independent of @xmath (Eq. ( 3.5 )). A RF field solver, [ 124 ]
based on Maxwell’s equations and a cold plasma dielectric tensor, is
employed in this study. The motivations of our work are to explain the
wave field measurements in MAGPIE, and to study the effects of magnetic
field configuration on helicon wave propagation. The rest of the chapter
is organised as follows: Sec. 3.2 describes the diagnostic tools,
together with the measured static magnetic field, plasma density and
temperature profiles; Sec. 3.3 provides an overview of the employed
theoretical model and the numerical code, together with comparisons
between computed and measured wave fields; Sec. 3.4 is dedicated to a
numerical study of the effects of plasma density and static magnetic
field profiles on the wave propagation characteristics; and Sec. 3.5
studies the physics meaning of the enhancement factor to the
electron-ion Coulomb collision frequency, and the effects of the
direction of static magnetic field on wave propagations. Finally, Sec.
3.6 presents concluding remarks and future work for continuing research.

### 3.2 Experiment

#### 3.2.1 Plasma profile diagnostics

A passively compensated Langmuir probe was employed in our experiment to
measure the plasma density and electron temperature, calculated from the
@xmath curve obtained by an Impedans Data Acquisition system. [ 126 ]
The probe comprises a platinum wire of diameter @xmath mm, and a
surrounding alumina insulator. The length of the insulator is @xmath mm
shorter than that of the platinum wire so that the exposed platinum wire
forms the probe tip. Electron currents were drawn to clean the probe
during regular intervals of argon discharges. The probe is located at
@xmath m as shown in Fig. 1.8 .

Typical measured axial profile of field strength and radial profiles of
plasma density and electron temperature in MAGPIE are shown in Fig. 3.1
. As shown in Fig. 3.1 (a), the increase in field strength, @xmath ,
from antenna end ( @xmath m) to field peak ( @xmath m) is a factor of
@xmath . The axial profile of plasma density, @xmath , is assumed to be
proportional to @xmath , consistent with generally accepted knowledge
that the density follows the magnetic field linearly. [ 49 , 127 ]
Figure 3.1 (b) shows the radial profiles of plasma density, @xmath , and
electron temperature, @xmath , measured at @xmath m and fitted with
straight lines. During the density fitting procedure, in order to avoid
negative fitted values, the density was set to zero in the region of
@xmath m. We assume the total density profile is separable, such that
@xmath . The fitted lines in @xmath and @xmath , and the measured @xmath
data will be used in Sec. 3.3 to constrain wave field simulations.

#### 3.2.2 Wave field diagnostics

Helicon wave fields were measured by a two-axis “B dot” or Mirnov probe.
Details about the probe can be found in Blackwell et al.. [ 8 ] To
measure the axial profiles of @xmath and @xmath , the probe was inserted
on axis from the end of the target chamber. The probe is long enough to
measure @xmath and @xmath in the range @xmath m. Two perpendicular
magnetic field components ( @xmath and @xmath in this case) can be
sampled simultaneously. To measure the radial profiles of the three
magnetic wave components, @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , the probe was
inserted radially at @xmath m, and rotated about its axis to measure
@xmath and @xmath . The B-dot probe couples inductively to the magnetic
components of the helicon wave and electrostatically to the RF time
varying plasma potential. To limit our measurements to the inductively
coupled response, a current balun was employed to screen the
electrostatic response. Further information about the procedure to
eliminate the electrostatic response of the probe can be found in Franck
et al.. [ 128 ] Both axial and radial profiles of wave phase were
measured through a phase-comparison method, similar to Light et al.. [
75 ] To measure the variation in wave phase with axial position, the
signal from an on-axis axially inserted probe was compared to the phase
of the antenna current. A similar procedure was conducted to measure the
variation in wave phase with radial position at @xmath m. It should be
noted that all probe diagnostics are intrusive, and can affect the
plasma parameters, and hence the wave fields.

### 3.3 Simulation

A RF field solver (or ElectroMagnetic Solver, EMS [ 124 ] ) based on
Maxwell’s equations and a cold-plasma dielectric tensor is employed in
this study to interpret the RF waves measured in MAGPIE. This solver has
been used successfully in explaining wave phenomena in two other
machines: a helicon discharge machine at The University of Texas at
Austin [ 53 ] and the LAPD at the University of California at Los
Angles. [ 10 ] Since these two machines have similar plasma density,
temperature and particle species to those on the MAGPIE, the EMS should
be applicable to describing the wave observations in MAGPIE. Details of
the solver can be found in Chen et al., [ 124 ] while a brief overview
is given below.

#### 3.3.1 Ems

The Maxwell’s equations that this solver employs to determine the RF
wave field in a helicon discharge are eventually Eq. ( 1.1 ) and Eq. (
1.11 ) but including an external antenna current @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here, we have dropped the subscript “ @xmath ” for simplicity. Because
the wave field is driven by the antenna, the wave frequency is the same
to the antenna driving frequency @xmath . The quantities @xmath and
@xmath are linked via the cold-plasma dielectric tensor @xmath (Eq. (
1.8 )) that represents vacuum, glass and plasma. In the vacuum and glass
regions, the dielectric tensor is @xmath , where @xmath is the Kronecker
symbol and @xmath is a scalar. The term @xmath equals to @xmath and
@xmath for vacuum and glass regions, respectively, where @xmath is the
dielectric constant of glass. In the plasma region, the relation between
@xmath and @xmath has the form [ 24 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the unit vector along the static magnetic field. To take
into account the collisions of particles in the discharge, we introduce
a phenomenological collision term @xmath for each species into @xmath ,
and rewrite Eq. ( 1.9 ) and Eq. ( 1.10 ) to: [ 24 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

For plasma parameters typical of MAGPIE, the electron-neutral collision
frequency is found to be an order of magnitude smaller than the
electron-ion collision frequency, and two orders smaller than the
electron-ion collision frequency required to match the experimental
results (Sec. 3.3.2 ). Thus, electron-neutral collisions are neglected.
Because @xmath and @xmath do not contribute to the momentum exchange
between electron and ion fluids, [ 12 ] collision frequencies for
electrons and ions species are @xmath and @xmath , respectively, from
which we can see @xmath . Here, @xmath and @xmath are given in eV and
@xmath , respectively, and the Coulomb logarithm is calculated to be ln
@xmath . Singly ionised argon ions are assumed in this study, so that
@xmath .

The static magnetic field is assumed to be axisymmetric with @xmath and
@xmath . It is therefore appropriate to use a near axis expansion for
the field, namely @xmath is only dependent on @xmath and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

The antenna, as described in Sec. 1.2.2 , is a left hand half-turn
helical antenna. We assume that the antenna current is divergence free,
to eliminate the capacitive coupling. Fourier components of the antenna
current density are given by:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the antenna length, @xmath the antenna radius, @xmath
the distance between the antenna and the endplate in the source region,
and @xmath the Heaviside step function. Note that the antenna geometry
selects only odd harmonic mode number @xmath , as indicated by Chen et
al.. [ 124 ]

Equations ( 3.1 ) and ( 3.2 ) are Fourier transformed with respect to
the azimuthal angle and then solved (for an azimuthal mode number @xmath
) by a finite difference scheme on a 2D domain ( @xmath , @xmath ). The
computational domain is shown in Fig. 3.2 .

The enclosing chamber is assumed to be ideally conducting so that the
tangential components of @xmath vanish at the chamber walls, i. e.

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath and @xmath the radius and the length of the chamber,
respectively. Moreover, all field components must be regular on axis,
thus, @xmath and @xmath for @xmath ; @xmath and @xmath for @xmath . [ 10
] In the present work, we choose the fundamental odd mode number @xmath
, which is preferentially excited in the helicon discharge launched by a
left hand half-turn helical antenna. [ 74 , 75 , 129 ] . In the
experiment, there is a radial air gap ( @xmath m) between the antenna
and the glass tube, which is taken as glass region in the computational
domain. We found that simulated results are insensitive to the
dielectric constant in the glass region @xmath m by varying the constant
from @xmath to @xmath . As no change was detected in the wave field, we
therefore expanded the glass area radially to fill this air gap. The
thickness of the antenna is approximately @xmath m.

#### 3.3.2 Computed and measured wave fields

Based on the measured field strength configuration and plasma profiles
shown in Fig. 3.1 , simulations are performed. Figure 3.3 shows the
axial profiles of the computed @xmath amplitude and phase on axis, and
their comparisons with experimental data. With the collisionality set to
@xmath , where @xmath is the effective collision frequency, and the
antenna radius set to match the experiment, the predicted wave field is
@xmath of the measured value, and the profile a poor match to the
experiment. It is possible to obtain better agreement by varying the
collisionality, which strongly affects the profile but leaves the
magnitude largely unchanged, and the antenna radius, which strongly
affects the field amplitude and leaves the radial and axial profiles of
@xmath unchanged. A qualitative match between measurement and simulation
of the axial variation of @xmath is found using an enhancement in
collisionality of @xmath with @xmath , and an adjustment in antenna
dimension of @xmath with @xmath . Since the collision frequency is
proportional to @xmath , if the electron temperature was wrong, it has
to be @xmath times smaller in order to get the agreement. Calculation of
the axial gradient of the computed phase variation shows a travelling
wave, with a good agreement with data.

The local minimum observed both experimentally and numerically in the
axial profile of @xmath around @xmath m has been also observed in many
other devices, [ 81 , 130 , 75 , 73 ] for both uniform and non-uniform
field cases. For the uniform field case, it has been suggested that the
spatial modulation of the helicon wave amplitude is not caused by
reflections from the end boundaries, but by a simultaneous excitation of
two radial modes. [ 48 , 74 , 75 , 73 ] Similarly, the minimum observed
in MAGPIE cannot be explained by standing waves, because the amplitude
becomes much smaller at bigger @xmath (suggesting strong damping), and
the phase advances with increasing @xmath (denoting a travelling wave).
Further, radial profiles of the wave field in Fig. 3.4 feature a
possible superposition of the first and second radial modes of the
@xmath azimuthal mode. Therefore, we speculate that the minimum observed
here may be also due to the simultaneous excitation of two fundamental
radial modes. We will show later that radial gradient in plasma density
is essential for the excitation of this local minimum under the present
experimental conditions.

Figure 3.4 shows the radial profiles of computed wave fields for @xmath
and @xmath at three axial positions in the target region, together with
the experimental data measured at @xmath m. The predicted wave field
amplitude profile at @xmath m is consistent with the data, but the
magnitude is nearly double the measured value, and the phase profile is
a poor match. We have also computed the wave fields at axial locations
with best agreement to the amplitude ( @xmath m) and phase ( @xmath m).
We justify this freedom of choice by the experimental uncertainty in
axial density profile, and the numerical sensitivity identified in the
radial profile of the wave field with axial position. Inspection of Fig.
3.4 reveals that it is possible to find a reasonable agreement to the
wave amplitude and phase profile, albeit independently. As expected, all
calculations show the wave mode structure of @xmath through @xmath ,
consistent with the antenna parity. The near-null minima in both @xmath
and @xmath suggest a likely simultaneous excitation of the first and
second radial modes. This may account for the minimum in Fig. 3.3 (a),
and is consistent with conclusions from others. [ 48 , 73 , 74 , 75 ,
129 ] Mori et al. [ 73 ] suggested that the superposition feature is
associated with a wave focusing effect caused by the non-uniform
magnetic field in the target region.

### 3.4 Numerical profile scans

It has previously been shown that the plasma density can be further
increased by introducing a cusp or non-uniform static magnetic field in
the vicinity of the helicon antenna. [ 18 , 47 , 19 , 80 ] To shed light
on the increased plasma production, we perform a detailed numerical
study on the effects of radial and axial plasma density gradients and
axial magnetic field gradient on wave propagation characteristics. The
enhancement of @xmath to @xmath and the adjustment of @xmath to @xmath
are still employed in this section because they provide a good agreement
with the measured wave field.

#### 3.4.1 Axial profile of plasma density

We first study the effect of varying the axial gradient of plasma
density, which has been assumed to be linear with the static magnetic
field so far, on wave propagations by comparing the wave fields from
three different on-axis density profiles shown in Fig. 3.5 (a).

Other conditions are kept the same as previous sections. The computed
wave fields in axial direction (on-axis) are shown in Fig. 3.5 (b) and
Fig. 3.5 (c). A log scale in the amplitude has been employed to see the
wave propagation features clearly. We can see from the phase variations
(Fig. 3.5 (c)) that as density is decreased in the target region the
wavelength increases, which is consistent with a simple theory developed
previously (see Eq. ( 1.29 )), [ 48 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

Thus, if @xmath , @xmath (plasma radius) and @xmath are all fixed,
@xmath is proportional to @xmath , which means that the wavelength
becomes larger at lower density. Here, the value of @xmath is the first
non-zero Bessel root of @xmath , representing the first radial mode,
which is assumed to be dominant in our case. Moreover, for all density
profiles shown in Fig. 3.5 (a), the wavelength is bigger in region of
@xmath m than that in other regions, indicating a locally increased
phase velocity. Further inspection of Fig. 3.5 (b) and Fig. 3.5 (c)
shows that density increasing in proportion to the static magnetic field
has little effect on RF absorption, while the density level near the
antenna affects the wave amplitude significantly at all axial locations.

#### 3.4.2 Axial profile of static magnetic field

Second, following Sec. 3.4.1 , we keep the axially uniform density
profile and study the effects of axial gradient in static magnetic
field, which is radially near uniform according to Eq. ( 3.5 ). Three
employed field profiles are shown in Fig. 3.6 (a),

which enable us to study the effects of field gradient in target and
source regions seperately on wave propagations. Comparison between solid
and dashed lines in Fig. 3.6 (b) and Fig. 3.6 (c) shows that the axial
gradient in magnetic field in the target region may increase the
propagation distance of helicon waves, consistent with Mori et al.’s
conclusion that a focused non-uniform magnetic field provides easier
access for helicon wave propagations than a uniform field, [ 73 ] or
perhaps the increased field strength in that region increases the
collisional damping length of helicon waves. The simple theory in Eq. (
3.8 ) is satisfied again here: with decreased field strength in the
target region, the wavelength becomes shorter. Although the difference
between dashed and dotted field profiles is small as shown in Fig. 3.6
(a), the computed field amplitudes are significantly different. Figure
3.6 (b) and Fig. 3.6 (c) show that with a uniform field profile, the
wave amplitude is much bigger than that with non-uniform field profile
for @xmath m. Furthermore, waves keep their travelling features till the
left endplate for uniform @xmath , whereas for non-uniform @xmath the
wavelength becomes smaller when approaching left, and the waves are not
travelling at all when @xmath is low enough ( @xmath m).

#### 3.4.3 Radial profile of plasma density

Now, we keep the plasma density and static magnetic field both uniform
in the axial direction, and study the effects of radial gradient in
plasma density. The two density profiles employed are shown in Fig. 3.7
(a),

with and without radial gradient, and their corresponding results are
shown in Fig. 3.7 (b) and Fig. 3.7 (c). We can see first that the local
minimum in wave amplitude profiles, e. g. at @xmath m and @xmath m,
disappear when the radial density profile is flat, suggesting that the
radial gradient in plasma density is essential to have a local minimum
under the present conditions. Second, the wave amplitude is much bigger
in both target and source regions for plasma density with radial
gradient, suggesting that a radial gradient in density may be useful to
maximise the plasma production.

### 3.5 Collisionality and field direction

#### 3.5.1 Enhancement of electron-ion collision frequency

In a similar manner to other work, [ 10 , 53 ] we have used an
enhancement to @xmath (here @xmath ), in order to find a qualitative
match of simulated wave field to the data. In this section, we explore
the physical consequences of scaling @xmath in simulations while keeping
the adjustment @xmath in the antenna radius. Variations of wave
amplitude on axis in the axial direction for different collision
frequencies are shown in Fig. 3.8 .

As the collision frequency is increased from @xmath to @xmath , the wave
amplitude decreases nearly everywhere, and the wave decay length is
shortened. This indicates that the wave energy or power coupled from the
antenna to the core plasma drops as the collision frequency becomes
higher, and the power is more absorbed under the antenna. This is
consistent with a previous conclusion that the RF energy is almost all
absorbed in the near region of the antenna rather than in the far
region. [ 74 ] The oscillations near the downstream and upstream ends at
low @xmath are caused by reflections from the ideally conducting
endplates, which disappear if the endplates are moved further away.

As suggested by Lee et al., [ 53 ] an enhanced electron-ion collision
frequency may be due to ion-acoustic turbulence which can happen if the
electron drift velocity exceeds the speed of sound in magnetised
plasmas. Based on the experimental conditions in MAGPIE, we have
calculated the threshold field strength @xmath , below which
ion-acoustic turbulence can happen. This threshold is given by @xmath ,
where @xmath is the electron drift velocity with @xmath Boltzmann’s
constant and @xmath the speed of sound in magnetised plasmas.
Application to MAGPIE conditions yields @xmath . Thus, the whole source
region which produces helicon plasmas and waves, has a magnetic field
below this threshold. The ion-acoustic turbulence has the effect of
providing additional electron-ion collisions within a dielectric tensor
model, and thereby improves the agreement with observations. Other
possible reason for this enhanced electron-ion collisionality includes
kinetic effects which are beyond the reach of the employed cold-plasma
model, e.g. Landau damping. The Trivelpiece-Gould mode, which could be
present in the low field region ( @xmath T) and is consistent with the
strong edge heating observed at enhanced collision frequencies, [ 131 ,
132 ] is included in the present full wave simulations. For the present
conditions of MAGPIE, the electron drift velocity is well blow the
electron thermal speed, therefore, the Buneman instability does not
occur.

#### 3.5.2 Direction of static magnetic field

Observations have been made previously that the directionality of
helicon wave propagations is dependent on the direction of static
magnetic field in helicon discharges using helical antennas, but all in
uniform field configurations. [ 74 , 48 , 133 , 53 ] In this section, we
study the directionality in a non-uniform field configuration for a
left-hand half turn helical antenna. Specifically, we have computed the
wave amplitude and wave energy density in MAGPIE for the experimental
and field reversed configurations. In MAGPIE, the field points from
target to source. Figure 3.9 shows the computed axial profiles of wave
amplitude on axis and 2D contour plots of wave energy density for both
field direction pointing from target to source (Fig. 3.9 (a) and Fig.
3.9 (b)) and field direction pointing from source to target (Fig. 3.9
and Fig. 3.9 (d)). In this calculation, we have chosen @xmath to see
more details, and chosen the density profile to be linear with @xmath in
the axial direction and non-uniform in radius as measured in Fig. 3.1
(b). The field strength profile used here is shown in Fig. 3.1 (a).
Inspection of Fig. 3.9 reveals that the wave energy is larger on the
opposite side of the antenna, relative to the direction of the static
magnetic field. This observation has been confirmed experimentally
through finding that the plasma is brighter on the opposite side of the
antenna relative to the direction of the applied external field. In
summary, the dependence of the direction of helicon wave propagations to
that of static magnetic field still exists even when the field
configuration is non-uniform.

### 3.6 Conclusions

A RF field solver based on Maxwell’s equations and a cold-plasma
dielectric tensor is employed to describe the wave phenomena observed in
a cylindrical non-uniform helicon discharge, MAGPIE. Here, the
non-uniformity is both radial and axial: the plasma density is dependent
on @xmath and @xmath , the static magnetic field varies with @xmath ,
and the electron temperature is a function of @xmath . A linear fitting
was conducted for radial profiles of plasma density and electron
temperature, and the fitted profiles were utilised in wave field
calculations. A linear relationship between the axial profile of plasma
density and the static magnetic field was also assumed. Other conditions
used in the simulation were taken from experiment directly, including
filling gas (argon), antenna current of @xmath A, driving frequency of
@xmath MHz, and a left hand half-turn helical antenna.

With an enhancement factor of @xmath to the electron-ion Coulomb
collision frequency @xmath to approximate the observed attenuation, and
a @xmath reduction in the antenna radius to match the amplitude of the
wave field, the wave solver produced consistent wave fields compared to
experimental data, including the axial and radial profiles of wave
amplitude and phase. A local minimum in the axial profiles of wave
amplitude was observed both experimentally and numerically, agreeing
with previous studies. [ 81 , 130 , 75 , 73 ] Mode structure of @xmath
is consistent with the left hand half-turn helical antenna being used. A
possible explanation for the enhanced electron-ion collision frequency
has been offered through ion-acoustic turbulence, which can happen if
the electron drift velocity exceeds the speed of sound in magnetised
plasmas. [ 53 ] By calculating these two speeds based on MAGPIE
conditions, we found that it is indeed satisfied in the source region of
MAGPIE where the helicon plasmas and waves are produced. For the field
strength under the driving antenna, the ratio of electron drift velocity
and the speed of sound is around @xmath . Other possible candidate
explanation may also include kinetic effects which are neglected in the
cold-plasma model employed here.

A numerical study on the effects of axial gradients in plasma density
and static magnetic field on wave propagations was carried out. This
showed that density increasing in proportion to the static magnetic
field has little effect on RF absorption, while the density level near
the antenna affects the wave amplitude significantly at all axial
locations. The axial gradient in magnetic field increases the decay
length of helicon waves in the target region. The relationship between
plasma density, static magnetic field and axial wavelength is consistent
with a simple theory developed previously. [ 48 ]

A numerical scan of the enhancement factor to @xmath reveals that with
increased electron-ion collision frequency the wave amplitude is lowered
and more focused near the antenna. This is mainly because of stronger
edge heating at higher collision frequencies which prevent more energy
transported from the antenna into the core plasma. The wave amplitude
profile at @xmath , which agrees with experimental data, shows
consistent feature with a previous study that the RF energy is almost
all absorbed in the near region of the antenna rather than in the far
region. [ 74 ] We also studied the effect of the direction of static
magnetic field on wave propagations, and found the antiparallel feature
that waves propagate in the opposite direction of magnetic field for the
antenna helicity existing in these experiments. This dependence of the
direction of helicon wave propagations to that of static magnetic field
in a non-uniform field configuration is consistent with previous
observations made in uniform field configurations. [ 74 , 48 , 133 , 53
]

Physics questions raised by this work include: further explanation of
exactly how axially non-uniform field might affect the radially
localised helicon mode, [ 35 ] inclusion of different @xmath numbers in
the glass layer and any subsequent coupling to the plasma at the
plasma-glass interface, and identification of independent first and
second radial modes that superpose to yield a local minimum in wave
field amplitude at @xmath m. Experimental measurements that might
corroborate the wave field generation mechanism and associated physics
include: the measurement of axial profile of density, and measurements
of @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath with a reversed field.

## Chapter 4 Gap eigenmode of radially localised helicon waves in a
periodic structure

The EMS (ElectroMagnetic Solver [ 124 ] ) is employed to model a
spectral gap and a gap eigenmode in a periodic structure in the whistler
frequency range. A RLH (Radially Localised Helicon [ 35 ] ) mode is
considered. We demonstrate that the computed gap frequency and gap width
agree well with a theoretical analysis, and find a discrete eigenmode
inside the gap by introducing a defect to the system’s periodicity. The
axial wavelength of the gap eigenmode is close to twice the system’s
periodicity, which is consistent with Bragg’s law. Such an eigenmode
could be excited by energetic electrons, similar to the excitation of
Toroidal Alfvén Eigenmodes (TAE) by energetic ions in tokamaks.
Experimental identification of this mode is conceivable on the LAPD. [ 9
]

### 4.1 Introduction

It is a generic phenomenon that spectral gaps are formed when waves
propagate in periodic media, and eigenmodes can exist with frequencies
inside the spectral gaps if a defect is introduced to break the system’s
perfect translational symmetry, and create an effective potential well
to localise these waves. [ 134 , 135 , 136 , 137 , 138 , 139 ] Fusion
plasmas have a few periodicities that can produce spectral gaps:
geodesic curvature of field lines, [ 140 ] elongation [ 141 , 142 ] or
triangularity of flux surfaces, [ 143 ] helicity [ 144 ] and periodic
mirroring in stellerators. [ 145 ] Weakly damped eigenmodes which are
readily destabilised by energetic ions often reside in these gaps, and
they may degrade fast ion confinement. [ 146 , 147 ] The most
extensively studied gap eigenmode is TAE, [ 148 ] however, there are
also numerous other modes with similar features. [ 149 , 150 , 151 , 152
]

Zhang et. al. [ 10 ] observed a spectral gap in the shear Alfvén wave
continuum in experiments on the LAPD with a multiple magnetic mirror
array, and obtained consistent results through two-dimensional numerical
modelling using the finite difference code, EMS. [ 124 ] Although
eigenmodes inside this gap were not formed, a possible experimental
implementation was proposed to detect them. The idea is to use the
endplate of the machine as a “defect” that breaks the axial periodicity
or to vary current in one of the independently powered magnetic coils.

In this chapter, we will use EMS to examine a gap eigenmode in a linear
system with slightly broken axial periodicity. We will consider the RLH
mode, whose radial structure has been described in [ 35 ] . Beyond [ 35
] , which deals with uniform magnetic field, the spectral gap and gap
eigenmode of the RLH mode will be theoretically and numerically studied
in a rippled magnetic field in the present study, together with those
for shear Alfvén waves in Chapter 5 . We will show that the computed gap
frequency and gap width agree well with the theoretical analysis, and
that there is a discrete eigenmode inside the gap. Such an eigenmode
could be excited by energetic electrons, similarly to the excitation of
TAE by energetic ions in tokamaks, and possibly observed on a linear
device, e. g. LAPD.

### 4.2 Theoretical analysis

#### 4.2.1 Basic equations

The spatial structure of RLH wave field and the corresponding dispersion
relation can be found from Eq. ( 1.52 ) that applies to a whistler-type
linear wave in a cold plasma cylinder. [ 35 ] For a cylindrical
coordinate system of ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ) with @xmath the
azimuthal angle and wave form of @xmath , it has the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath with @xmath and @xmath the axial and azimuthal components
of the wave electric field, respectively, @xmath , and @xmath . Here,
@xmath and @xmath are the electron plasma frequency and electron
cyclotron frequency, respectively. In this section, we will limit our
consideration to the case of sufficiently dense plasma in which @xmath ,
where @xmath is the plasma radius, and nonzero values of the azimuthal
mode number @xmath as the radial nonuniformity of plasma density has a
surprisingly strong effect on the structure of helicon modes with @xmath
. [ 35 ] The resulting eigenfrequency for the mode of interest scales
roughly as [ 35 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

which shows that the term @xmath in the denominator of Eq. ( 4.1 ) can
be estimated as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

It was also shown in [ 35 ] (see Eq. (16) there) that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is thus much less than unity for the mode of interest. The
underlying reason is that the electron conductivity along the guiding
magnetic field is much greater than the cross-field Hall conductivity.
It is therefore allowable to set @xmath and ignore the term @xmath in
the denominator of Eq. ( 4.1 ), which gives

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

We now generalise this equation to the case of slightly modulated (
@xmath -dependent) plasma equilibrium with a following separable form of
@xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here, @xmath and @xmath are the modulation envelope and wavenumber
respectively. The axial scale-length of the envelope @xmath is assumed
to be much greater than @xmath . We recall that @xmath and transform
Eq. ( 4.5 ) to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

The modulated equilibrium introduces resonant coupling between the modes
with @xmath and @xmath , which suggests the following form for @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath are slow functions of @xmath compared to @xmath
. Let @xmath be an eigenfrequency of Eq. ( 4.7 ) for @xmath and @xmath .
It is then straightforward to separate spatial scales in Eq. ( 4.7 ) and
obtain a set of coupled equations for @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

We have neglected second axial derivatives of @xmath and @xmath and
arranged Eq. ( 4.9 ) and Eq. ( 4.10 ) so that their right hand sides
represent relatively small terms compared to the dominant terms on the
left hand sides. With this ordering, we conclude that the radial
dependencies of @xmath and @xmath need to be close to the eigenfunction
@xmath of the lowest order ODE

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

The differential operator in this equation is self-adjoint. As a result,
multiplication of Eq. ( 4.9 ) and Eq. ( 4.10 ) by @xmath and integration
over radius lead to:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.13)
  -- -- -- --------

Having eliminated the lowest order terms, we now set:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

in Eq. ( 4.12 ) and Eq. ( 4.13 ) to obtain the following set of coupled
equations for @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 4.2.2 Spectral gap and continuum

In the case of @xmath -independent @xmath , Eq. ( 4.15 ) and Eq. ( 4.16
) have exponential solutions

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath the wave number. The corresponding dispersion relation has
two roots:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here, @xmath and @xmath are the continuum frequencies above and below
the spectral gap, respectively. The upper and lower tips of the spectral
gap correspond to @xmath :

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.19)
  -- -- -- --------

The normalised width of the gap, @xmath , is therefore equal to the
modulation amplitude @xmath . The central frequency of the gap @xmath
needs to be found from Eq. ( 4.11 ) as the RLH eigenfrequency for an
axially uniform plasma cylinder and it can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are the on-axis values and the numerical
form-factor @xmath is determined by the plasma radial profile.

#### 4.2.3 Wall-localised eigenmodes

A discrete-spectrum eigenmode can be created inside the spectral gap if
the system’s periodicity is broken. We illustrate that by considering an
ideally conducting endplate located at @xmath , so that the plasma now
occupies only a half cylinder to the right of the endplate ( @xmath ).
The boundary condition at the endplate is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

or, equivalently,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

(see Eq. ( 4.8 ) and Eq. ( 4.14 )). The electric field of the
discrete-spectrum mode must also vanish at @xmath , i. e.,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

Equation ( 4.15 ) and Eq. ( 4.16 ) (with @xmath ) admit an exponential
solution

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

with a positive value of @xmath that satisfies boundary conditions in
Eq. ( 4.22 ) and Eq. ( 4.23 ). Indeed, the exponential ansatz, Eq. (
4.24 ), reduces Eq. ( 4.15 ), Eq. ( 4.16 ) and Eq. ( 4.22 ) to an
algebraic set:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

The solvability conditions for this set determine @xmath and @xmath as
functions of @xmath as follows:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

We observe that @xmath is positive for @xmath , and the wave field
therefore vanishes at infinity in this case to represent a discrete
eigenmode whose frequency is automatically inside the gap. In
particular, the eigenfrequency is exactly at the gap centre when @xmath
. We further note that this wall-localised solution can also be viewed
as an odd-parity eigenmode ( @xmath ) in the entire periodic cylinder
with a defect at @xmath . An axial profile of @xmath with such defect is
shown in Fig. 4.1 (a).

#### 4.2.4 Even-parity eigenmode

In contrast with Fig. 4.1 (a), Fig. 4.1 (b) illustrates a defect with
@xmath that does not produce an odd-parity mode. Instead, an even-parity
mode exists in this case. This mode is still described by Eq. ( 4.15 )
and Eq. ( 4.16 ), but the boundary condition at @xmath now changes from
Eq. ( 4.21 ) to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

or, equivalently,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

The solvability conditions for Eq. ( 4.25 ), Eq. ( 4.26 ) and Eq. ( 4.31
) now give:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

and we observe that @xmath is positive (the wave field vanishes at
infinity) when @xmath , i. e. this even-parity eigenmode indeed requires
@xmath for its existence.

#### 4.2.5 Schrödinger equation for gap eigenmodes

Equation ( 4.15 ) and Eq. ( 4.16 ) can be straightforwardly transformed
into two independent second-order equations for @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

Both of them can be further reduced to a time-independent Schrödinger
equation when @xmath is nearly constant. We assume @xmath with @xmath
and @xmath . The discrete-spectrum modes in this case are very close to
the tips of the gap. For the lower tip, we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath . We can then neglect @xmath and @xmath in the derivative
term of Eq. ( 4.34 ) and get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

Similar procedure for the upper tip gives

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

We note that any negative function @xmath acts as a potential well that
supports spatially localised eigenmodes of Eq. ( 4.37 ) and Eq. ( 4.38 )
with @xmath and @xmath , respectively. The eigenfrequencies of these
modes belong to the spectral gap in the continuum.

### 4.3 Numerical results and discussion

The EMS, [ 124 ] as introduced in Sec. 3.3.1 , is employed to study the
RLH spectral gap and gap eigenmode inside. The computational domain is
shown in Fig. 4.2 . A helical antenna is employed to excite an @xmath
mode in the plasma. The enclosing chamber is assumed to be ideally
conducting so that the boundary conditions are the same to those in
Eq. ( 3.7 ).

#### 4.3.1 RLH mode in a straight cylinder

We first use EMS to calculate the radial structure of the RLH mode in a
straight cylinder with a uniform static magnetic field and recover the
mode dispersion relation. We consider a single-ionised argon plasma with
a radial density profile shown in Fig. 4.3 (a).

The surrounding vacuum chamber and the position of the rf-antenna are
shown in Fig. 4.2 . The static magnetic field in this simulation is
@xmath T and the electron-ion collision frequency on axis is @xmath . We
run EMS for various frequencies of the antenna current, select the
@xmath azimuthal component of the plasma response and calculate the
dominant axial wavenumber, @xmath , of this component via Fourier
decomposition. We observe an apparently preferred axial coupling
direction for the @xmath wave generated by the helical antenna. The
collision frequency is sufficient to damp the radiated waves
significantly towards the endplates but the dominant wavelength is still
seen clearly in the plot of the excited field (Fig. 4.3 (b)). The
resulting relation between @xmath and @xmath is shown in Fig. 4.3 (c).
We note that @xmath scales as @xmath with frequency, in agreement with
analytical scaling obtained in [ 35 ] , namely @xmath . A least squares
fit to the dispersion relation given by Eq. ( 4.20 ) with @xmath shows
that the form factor @xmath equals @xmath for the selected density
profile. The radial profile of this @xmath mode is presented in Fig. 4.3
(d).

#### 4.3.2 Spectral gap in a periodic structure

In order to demonstrate the spectral gap, we run EMS for the same
conditions as in Sec. 4.3.1 except that the static magnetic field is
weakly modulated along @xmath and has the form @xmath with @xmath T and
@xmath . The radial component of the static field is determined by Eq. (
3.5 ). We scan the antenna frequency (for a fixed amplitude of the
antenna current) and analyse the wave propagation from the antenna.
Figure 4.4 illustrates the results. Figure 4.4 (a) is a plot of the
on-axis signal at a @xmath m distance from the antenna, and shows an
interval of strong suppression (from @xmath Mrad/s to @xmath Mrad/s),
which represents the anticipated spectral gap. The location and width of
this gap agree well with analytic estimates based on Eq. ( 4.19 ) and
Eq. ( 4.20 ). Figure 4.4 (b) presents spatial distributions of wave
energy for frequencies that are inside and outside of the spectral gap,
from which we also see that wave propagation is evanescent inside the
gap.

#### 4.3.3 Gap eigenmodes

To form an eigenmode inside the spectral gap shown in Fig. 4.4 , we
introduce a defect in the otherwise periodic static magnetic field.
Equation ( 4.28 ) and Eq. ( 4.32 ) suggest that this defect should be
located at @xmath , in order for the eigenmode frequency to be at the
gap centre. The mode is then expected to have the shortest possible
width (see Eq. ( 4.29 ) and Eq. ( 4.33 )). Moreover, Sec. 4.2.3 and Sec.
4.2.4 indicate that the gap eigenmode can have either odd parity or even
parity, depending on the defect profile. We will confirm this analysis
by simulation results shown in Fig. 4.5 and Fig. 4.6 .

Figure 4.5 (a)-(d) illustrates the odd-parity gap eigenmode associated
with the defect shown in Fig. 4.1 (a). In order to minimise the role of
collisional dissipation and thereby obtain a sharper resonant peak in
Fig. 4.5 (c), we have reduced the collision frequency to @xmath in Fig.
4.5 simulation results. Figure 4.5 (a) shows that the eigenmode is a
standing wave localised around the defect. Its exponential envelope with
a decay length of @xmath m is consistent with analytical expectation
from Eq. ( 4.29 ). The evanescent field of the mode is only weakly
coupled to the distant antenna, but the resonance with the antenna
frequency still allows the mode to be excited easily. The internal scale
of this mode is close to twice the system’s periodicity, consistent with
Bragg’s law. Figure 4.5 (b) shows the on-axis profile of the mode
electric field, implying an odd function of @xmath at @xmath . The
corresponding magnetic field @xmath is, instead, an even function.
Figure 4.5 (d) presents a full view of the plasma response in ( @xmath ,
@xmath ) space with a clear eigenmode peak inside the spectral gap.

We have also performed similar calculations for the defect shown in Fig.
4.1 (b). This defect produces an even-parity mode seen in Fig. 4.6
(a)-(d). Except for different symmetries, the features of the even and
odd modes are apparently similar.

The effects of collisionality on gap eigenmodes are shown in Fig. 4.7 ,
from which we could see clearly a strength drop as the collisionality is
increased. Although the resonant peak decreases and broadens for larger
values of @xmath , it is still clearly visible even at the highest
collision frequency.

### 4.4 Summary and thoughts about possible experiments

We have shown that longitudinal modulation of the guiding magnetic field
in a plasma column creates a spectral gap for radially localised helicon
waves. Calculations performed with an EMS code reveal that this gap
prohibits wave propagation along the column when the driving frequency
of the RF antenna is in the forbidden range. The calculated width of the
gap is consistent with analytical estimates. We have also shown that a
discrete eigenmode can been formed inside the spectral gap by
introducing a local defect to the periodic structure. Both the
theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate two types of gap
eigenmode in the “imperfect” system: odd-parity mode and even-parity
mode, depending the type of the defect employed. The gap mode is
localised around the defect and represents a standing wave rather than
travelling wave. Its distinctive feature is a resonant peak in the
plasma response to the antenna current. The gap eigenmode has two
characteristic spatial scales: a short inner scale and a smooth
envelope. The inner scale is nearly twice the system’s periodicity,
which is characteristic for Bragg’s reflection; the envelope depends on
the modulation amplitude and it scales roughly as the inverse width of
the spectral gap.

A plausible way to identify the gap mode in a linear device with
multi-mirror configuration would be to use the end-plate of the machine
as a controllable defect in the periodic system. This could make the
mode observable with a modest number of mirrors in the machine. The LAPD
is an apparent candidate for such experiments, provided that dissipative
processes in the plasma do not destroy the gap-mode resonance. We have
estimated these dissipative processes for LAPD plasma conditions.
Collisional damping rate of the @xmath RLH mode can be roughly estimated
as @xmath , [ 32 ] where @xmath is the collision frequency for electrons
(a sum of electron-ion and electron-neutral collisions). Collisional
damping can therefore be controlled by varying the plasma radius. Our
illustrative simulation is for @xmath m, but the LAPD vacuum chamber
allows to produce plasmas with considerably larger value of @xmath (up
to @xmath m [ 10 , 9 ] ) and thereby reduce the damping significantly.
It may be preferable to choose plasma parameters in such a way that the
gap mode frequency is in the range of operational frequencies for
standard RF generators ( @xmath MHz [ 18 ] ) through Eq. ( 4.20 ). The
LAPD magnetic coils are about @xmath m in radius (inner), [ 9 ] which
limits the number of magnetic field periods within the machine length to
about @xmath . This number seems to be large enough for the mode
identification, especially because the axial extension of the mode is
expected to decrease when the modulation amplitude increases. Stronger
modulation of the magnetic field broadens the gap and makes it easier to
identify the mode in the presence of finite damping. Thus, the amplitude
of modulation is an apparent control knob for the conceivable
experiment. The LAPD experiment can use larger plasma radius and
stronger magnetic field (with the same plasma density @xmath ) to reduce
the damping but still keep the mode frequency in the convenient
operational range for the RF-antenna.

## Chapter 5 Gap eigenmode of shear Alfvén waves in a periodic structure

In this chapter, a gap in the shear Alfvén wave spectrum is predicted
for a cold cylindrical plasma by modulating the magnetic field
periodically. A discrete eigenmode is generated inside the gap by
breaking the field periodicity through an introduced defect. We find
that the axial wavelength of the gap eigenmode is nearly twice the
system’s periodicity, which is characteristic of Bragg’s reflection, and
the decay length of the eigenmode agrees well with the analytical
estimate. Our treatment is based on numerical and analytical solutions
to the cold plasma dielectric tensor, and complements Chapter 4 on the
gap eigenmode generation in the whistler frequency range.

### 5.1 Introduction

In Chapter 4 , a discrete eigenmode of RLH waves was generated inside a
spectral gap by introducing a defect to the system’s periodicity. [ 45 ]
This gap eigenmode is in the whistler frequency range and could be
excited by energetic electrons, similar to the excitation of toroidal
Alfvén eigenmodes by energetic ions in tokamaks. We concluded that this
eigenmode is observable on the LAPD, given that dissipative processes in
the plasma do not destroy the gap-mode resonance. The LAPD, which has
@xmath sets of pancake electromagnets ( @xmath in total) surrounding a
@xmath -m-long, @xmath -m-diam plasma column, is capable of forming
multiple magnetic mirrors and identifying a spectral gap of plasma
waves. [ 10 ] This makes it a promising candidate to identify a gap
eigenmode. However, to observe the RLH gap eigenmode, plasma parameters
on the LAPD have to be chosen carefully to keep the mode frequency
within the convenient operational range of standard RF generators. In
2008, Zhang et al. [ 10 ] observed spectral gaps and continua of SAW on
the LAPD, with the gap frequency about @xmath of the ion cyclotron
frequency. Although eigenmodes were not formed inside this gap, they
proposed a possible experimental implementation to detect them: varying
current in one of the independently powered magnetic coils to introduce
a strong defect that breaks the system’s periodicity. Therefore, we are
interested in generalising the gap-mode analysis from the whistler
frequency range to ion cyclotron range of frequencies. The SAW, which
have frequencies below the ion cyclotron frequency and are fundamentally
different from those with frequencies above, will be focused on with
reference to Zhang et al.’s experiment. [ 10 ] We shall numerically form
a gap eigenmode of SAW by introducing a defect to the system’s
periodicity.

### 5.2 Theoretical analysis

Although the focus of the study is on SAW, the theoretical analysis
presented below is also valid for waves with frequencies slightly above
the ion cyclotron frequency.

#### 5.2.1 Basic equations

We consider an electromagnetic wave in a cold plasma cylinder with
uniform static magnetic field and radially non-uniform plasma density.
The cold plasma approximation implies a much greater longitudinal wave
phase velocity than particle thermal velocity, and assures low Landau
damping. We start from the linear wave equation (see Eq. ( 1.44 ))

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

For @xmath , the components of @xmath become

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here, the relation @xmath has been used. As in Chapter 4 , we will limit
our consideration to the case of sufficiently dense plasma and nonzero
values of the azimuthal mode number @xmath , because the radial
nonuniformity of plasma density has a surprisingly strong effect on the
structure of @xmath modes. [ 35 ] Due to @xmath , the parallel
conductivity @xmath is very large so that the axial component of the
electric field vanishes, namely, @xmath . This simplifies the radial and
azimuthal components of Eq. ( 5.1 ) as:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

It is convenient to combine Eq. ( 5.3 ) and Eq. ( 5.4 ) into

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

and use Eq. ( 5.3 ) and Eq. ( 5.5 ) instead of Eq. ( 5.3 ) and Eq. ( 5.4
). It follows from Eq. ( 5.3 ) that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

for modes with sufficiently small values of @xmath and @xmath . We
choose small values of @xmath to see clear effects of the radial
non-uniformity in plasma density on the wave mode structure for non-zero
azimuthal mode numbers. [ 35 ] We can then use Eq. ( 5.6 ) to eliminate
@xmath from Eq. ( 5.5 ), and obtain the wave equation of SAW

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

Equation ( 5.7 ) is identical to the wave equation of RLH waves when
@xmath (see Eq. ( 1.52 )) and can be solved in a similar way.

#### 5.2.2 Uniform magnetic field: dispersion relation

We first solve Eq. ( 5.7 ) for a uniform magnetic field to derive the
dispersion relation of SAW. We shall construct a surface-wave solution
through considering a step-like radial profile of plasma density (see
Eq. ( 1.54 ))

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath the radius of the density discontinuity. The width of the
discontinuity layer at @xmath is assumed to be larger than the skin
depth, namely @xmath with @xmath half width of the layer. This density
profile leads to:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

We then assume a specific form of @xmath (see Eq. ( 1.55 ))

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath a constant electric field. Equation ( 5.7 ) is satisfied at
@xmath for any @xmath and @xmath for the density profile constructed.
For modes caused by the density jump, we integrate Eq. ( 5.7 ) across
the discontinuity layer @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

The right hand side of Eq. ( 5.11 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

due to Eq. ( 5.9 ), and the second term on the left hand side vanishes
because of the small value of @xmath and finite @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

Substituting Eq. ( 5.2 ), Eq. ( 5.9 ) and Eq. ( 5.10 ), Eq. ( 5.11 ) can
then be rewritten as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here, @xmath with @xmath and @xmath the ion plasma frequencies inside
and outside of the discontinuity layer, respectively, and @xmath is the
normalised wave frequency. Equation ( 5.14 ) describes the dispersion
relation of SAW propagating in a plasma cylinder with uniform magnetic
field and step-like radial profile of plasma density. For SAW with
@xmath and propagating in a uniform plasma, Eq. ( 5.14 ) becomes @xmath
due to @xmath and @xmath . This is the well-known dispersion relation
for SAW in a slab geometry.

#### 5.2.3 Periodic magnetic field: spectral gap and continuum

We now introduce a slight periodic modulation to the static magnetic
field, and solve Eq. ( 5.7 ) for the corresponding SAW spectrum. The
modulated field is of the form @xmath with @xmath the equilibrium field
strength, @xmath and @xmath the modulation factor and wavenumber,
respectively. This modulated equilibrium introduces resonant coupling
between the modes with @xmath , whose frequencies are the same and can
be solved from Eq. ( 5.14 ). Note from Eq. ( 5.7 ) that this modulation
takes effect through @xmath and @xmath , which are functions of @xmath
according to Eq. ( 5.2 ), we thereby have their linear Taylor expansions
about @xmath :

  -- -- -- --------
           (5.15)
  -- -- -- --------

Here, @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are the corresponding values
of @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath for a uniform static magnetic
field. The dependences of @xmath and @xmath on the frequency difference
( @xmath ) and modulation ( @xmath ) have been separated. By introducing
variables:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

we rewrite Eq. ( 5.15 ) as:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

Assuming @xmath and substituting Eq. ( 5.17 ) into Eq. ( 5.7 ) result in

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

Letting @xmath be the eigenfunction of the wave equation for the
equilibrium magnetic field @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

we multiply Eq. ( 5.18 ) by @xmath and integrate over radius to
eliminate the equilibrium terms via integration by parts,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

We try the following form of @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath and @xmath slow functions of @xmath compared with @xmath ,
and @xmath the wave number in the modulated field. Separating the
longitudinal Fourier harmonics in Eq. ( 5.20 ), we obtain two coupled
equations for @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

Introducing the following integrals of the eigenfunction:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

we rewrite Eq. ( 5.22 ) and Eq. ( 5.23 ) as:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

Recalling Eq. ( 5.16 ), we take the product of Eq. ( 5.25 ) and Eq. (
5.26 ), and obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

Multiplying Eq. ( 5.19 ) by @xmath and integrating over radius lead to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

We then rewrite Eq. ( 5.27 ) as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

Equation ( 5.29 ) is the dispersion relation of SAW propagating in a
plasma cylinder with periodic static magnetic field and arbitrary
density profiles.

This dispersion relation can be evaluated with a specific choice of
density profile. We investigate a step-like radial profile of plasma
density shown in Eq. ( 5.8 ) to avoid the continuum damping of SAW,
which may occur if plasma density changes continuously in radius.
Moreover, a realistic density profile gives multiple dispersion curves,
the feature of coupling to other modes, which makes it difficult to
study the propagating feature of SAW. The aim is to acquire an insight
into the problem first. Recalling @xmath , we have:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

which leads to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

Through Eq. ( 5.21 ), the eigenfunction @xmath corresponding to the
step-like density profile is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

and so we evaluate

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

Equation ( 5.30 ) further gives:

  -- -- -- --------
           (5.34)
  -- -- -- --------

We then calculate @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

which further gives

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

Substituting Eq. ( 5.31 ) and Eq. ( 5.36 ) into Eq. ( 5.29 ), we get the
dispersion relation of SAW for a step-like radial profile of plasma
density

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

When @xmath , @xmath is imaginary and waves are evanescent along the
plasma column, forming a spectral gap. The lower ( @xmath ) and upper (
@xmath ) edges of the gap can be calculated by setting @xmath in Eq. (
5.37 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

The gap width is thereby @xmath , which is the same to that of RLH waves
(see Eq. 4.19 ). When @xmath , @xmath is real and waves are propagable
along the plasma column, forming the spectral continuum.

#### 5.2.4 Defective magnetic field: gap eigenmode

Now we introduce a defect to the system’s periodicity, similar to that
employed in Chapter 4 , to create the gap eigenmode of SAW inside the
spectral gap indicated by Eq. ( 5.29 ) and Eq. ( 5.37 ). We assume that
the gap eigenmode will decay away from the defect location as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath the decay constant. Similarly to Eqs. ( 5.21 )-( 5.26 ) but
replacing @xmath with @xmath , we get:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

The system is completed with a boundary condition for @xmath . An
odd-parity gap eigenmode can be formed by applying the boundary
condition @xmath , which gives @xmath . The sum and difference of Eq. (
5.40 ) and Eq. ( 5.41 ) are:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

respectively. By using Eq. ( 5.16 ) and Eq. ( 5.28 ), we then solve for
the frequency and decay constant of the odd-parity gap eigenmode:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

Similarly, an even-parity gap eigenmode can be formed by applying the
boundary condition @xmath (with @xmath over @xmath ), which gives @xmath
. The corresponding frequency and decay constant of the even-parity gap
eigenmode are:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

By using Eq. ( 5.31 ) and Eq. ( 5.36 ), Eq. ( 5.45 ) and Eq. ( 5.47 )
can be evaluated for the step-like radial profile of plasma density
shown in Eq. ( 5.8 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

for the odd-parity and even-parity gap eigenmodes, respectively.

### 5.3 Numerical results

To validate the theoretical analysis in Sec. 5.2 , numerical
computations are conducted in this section. We use the EMS code [ 124 ]
to model the spectral gap and gap eigenmode of SAW. Figure 5.1 shows the
computational domain, which is similar to that in Chapter 4 but with
glass tube removed.

This will, for the step-like density profile employed below, ensure that
there is only one density discontinuity in the whole chamber, and it is
the density jump constructed. The enclosing chamber is assumed to be
ideally conducting, and the RF antenna is placed inside the plasma. To
well couple SAW, which are left-hand circularly polarised, the RF
antenna is twisted in the left-hand direction to the static magnetic
field, and it is half-turn helical to mainly excite non-axisymmetric
modes, as considered in the analysis. We choose step-like radial
profiles of plasma density to precisely compare with the analytical
results in Sec. 5.2 , and eliminate potential continuum damping of SAW.
Illustrative results for broadened density profiles will be given in
Sec. 5.4.1

For a step-like-peak density profile, as shown in Fig. 5.2 (a), the
discontinuity is chosen at @xmath m so as to ensure the total number of
particles in each volume is the same.

The on-axis plasma density is chosen to be @xmath , which is
sufficiently dense as assumed for Eq. ( 5.1 ). We consider a
single-ionised helium plasma, as did by Zhang et al., [ 10 ] so that the
on-axis electron-ion collision frequency is @xmath . The wave field
structure and dispersion relation of SAW are studied in a plasma
cylinder with uniform static magnetic field. Figure 5.2 (b) and Fig. 5.2
(d) show the axial and radial profiles of the computed wave field,
respectively, for an illustrative frequency at @xmath . A preferred
axial coupling direction can be seen clearly from Fig. 5.2 (b) due to
the helical antenna being used. Figure 5.2 (c) shows the computed
dispersion relation and its comparison with that from Eq. ( 5.14 ). The
inset figure shows the ratio between the numerical and analytical
results. The computed data were obtained by running the EMS for various
frequencies, for the same conditions, and calculating the dominant axial
mode number through a Fourier decomposition. We can see that they
qualitatively agree but diverge more when the wave frequency approaches
the ion cyclotron frequency. This may be due to that the computed values
of @xmath and @xmath , which become bigger when @xmath , are not
sufficiently small as assumed in the theoretical analysis (see Eq. ( 5.6
)).

Next, we introduce a small periodic modulation to the uniform magnetic
field, @xmath , to form a spectral gap of SAW. The periodicity @xmath
was chosen to locate the gap within the frequency range of @xmath where
SAW have a long decay length. Running EMS for the same conditions as
above, we obtain a clear spectral gap in both axial and radial
directions, as shown in Fig. 5.3 .

The gap width ( @xmath ) agrees well with the analytical estimate from
Eq. ( 5.38 ) ( @xmath ), although the gap location ( @xmath ) is
slightly lower than that @xmath from Eq. ( 5.14 ).

Section 5.2.4 indicates that an eigenmode could be formed inside the
spectral gap if a defect is introduced to break the system’s
periodicity. Moreover, the defect should be located at @xmath in order
to form the eigenmode with frequency at the gap centre (see Eq. ( 5.44 )
and Eq. ( 5.46 )) and with shortest possible width (see Eq. ( 5.48 ) and
Eq. ( 5.49 )). Further, the gap eigenmode can be either odd-parity or
even-parity around the defect location, depending upon the defect
configurations. Figure 5.4 and Fig. 5.5 show the defect configurations
employed and the corresponding odd-parity and even-parity gap eigenmodes
formed.

To minimise the role of collisional dissipation and thus get a sharper
resonant peak (see Fig. 5.4 (c) and Fig. 5.5 (c)), the collision
frequency has been reduced to @xmath . Figure 5.4 (a) and Fig. 5.5 (a)
show that the eigenmodes are standing waves and their wavelengths are
close to twice the system’s periodicity, which is characteristic of
Bragg’s reflection. The decay lengths indicated by the exponential
envelopes agree well with the analytical estimates from Eq. ( 5.48 ) and
Eq. ( 5.49 ). The odd-parity and even-parity features are indicated by
the axial profiles of the azimuthal electric field around the defect
location, shown in Fig. 5.4 (b) and Fig. 5.5 (b), respectively. Figure
5.4 (d) and Fig. 5.5 (d) give full views of the plasma response in (
@xmath ) space with a clear eigenmode peak inside the spectral gap.

We also obtained similar gap eigenmodes for a step-like-hollow density
profile shown in Fig. 5.6 (a).

The discontinuity location is moved radially outward ( @xmath m) to keep
the total number of particles equal on each side. For a uniform static
magnetic field, illustrative axial and radial profiles of the computed
wave field are shown in Fig. 5.6 (b) and Fig. 5.6 (d), respectively, for
@xmath . A preferred axial coupling direction is again seen clearly in
Fig. 5.6 (b). The computed dispersion relation is compared with that
from Eq. ( 5.14 ) in Fig. 5.6 (c). It can be seen that the two
dispersion curves match at @xmath . To form a spectral gap, we modulated
the uniform static magnetic field in form of @xmath . We select @xmath
to locate the centre of the gap around the matching point by setting
@xmath in Eq. ( 5.14 ), and get @xmath . Figure 5.7 shows the computed
spectral gap and its comparison with the analytical estimates at @xmath
m.

The analytical lower and upper edges of the gap are calculated from
Eq. ( 5.38 ): @xmath and @xmath . We can see that numerical and
analytical spectral gaps agree quite well, in terms of the gap location
and width. The spatial distribution of wave energy for frequencies
inside and outside of the spectral gap is shown in Fig. 5.7 (b),
confirming that wave propagations along the plasma column are evanescent
for frequencies inside the spectral gap. The gap eigenmodes were formed
by introducing two types of defect to the system’s periodicity, as shown
in Fig. 5.8 and Fig. 5.9 for odd-parity and even-parity respectively. We
can see that they are similar to those for the step-like-peak density
profile, shown in Fig. 5.4 and Fig. 5.5 .

### 5.4 Experimental implementation

In this section, we comment on the possible experimental realisation of
the gap eigenmode of SAW in a periodic magnetic field.

#### 5.4.1 Radial width of density jump

The step-like radial profile of plasma density, which has been used so
far for precise comparison with the theoretical analysis in Sec. 5.2 ,
is not easily achievable in experiment. It clearly breaks down with
additional physics such as particle diffusion and cyclotron motion,
which act to broaden the radial width of density jump. We investigate
the effect of this width on the gap eigenmode formation by increasing it
from @xmath m, as used for Fig. 5.4 (c), to @xmath m, @xmath m and
@xmath m. Figure 5.10 (a) shows the density profiles broadened, and Fig.
5.10 (b) shows the corresponding resonant peaks inside the spectral gap.

It can be seen that the peak width and location remain the same. The
peak width was found to remain the same even when the density jump width
is increased to @xmath cm. Therefore, broadening the density profile
shown in Fig. 5.2 (a) to that achievable in experiment is unlikely to
affect the gap eigenmode formation. This is a sanity check that the gap
eigenmode observed here is sufficiently resolved in the absence of
continuum damping. Figure 5.10 (c) shows the location of this gap
eigenmode relative to the continuum damping region. The analytical
dispersion relations for uniform (same to the dashed line in Fig. 5.2
(c)) and periodic ( @xmath ) magnetic fields are overlaid. The location
of the gap eigenmode is at the joint point of the dispersion relation
for uniform field and the middle line of the spectral gap, because of
the chosen defect which forces @xmath to be zero in Eq. 5.44 and Eq.
5.46 . The dispersion relations for uniform plasma densities inside and
outside of the density jump (for uniform field) are also shown. They
label the upper and lower edges of the continuum damping region, because
the continuum damping only occurs when the wave frequency experiences
the local Alfvén frequency, namely @xmath . [ 153 ] We can see that the
gap eigenmode is currently outside of the continuum damping region. We
further found that deepening the density jump did not move the gap
eigenmode location into this region. To study the impact of continuum
damping on gap eigenmode formation, spectral gaps need be formed in a
lower frequency region, e. g. around @xmath where the dispersion
relation for uniform field is within the continuum damping region, and a
very high radial resolution across the broadened density jump should be
employed. This will surely increase the computation time significantly,
and we leave this work for future research.

#### 5.4.2 Implementation on the LAPD

A modification to the experiments of Zhang et al. [ 10 ] on the LAPD, in
which they observed spectral gaps and continua of SAW, is a possible
candidate. It is essential to ensure that dissipative processes in the
plasma do not destroy the gap-mode resonance. [ 45 ] There exist mainly
two types of dissipative mechanisms: continuum damping and collisional
damping. The former needs to be avoided first of all because it will
affect the mode structure globally and even prevent the propagation of
SAW. Decreasing the radial gradient of plasma density to narrow the
continuum damping region so that the gap eigenmode is located outside of
the region will probably help. The latter needs to be small in order to
form a sharp resonance peak, as pointed out in Chapter 4 . The
collisional damping rate of Alfvén waves (in terms of wave amplitude) is
given by [ 153 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are components of the wave
vector and electric conductivity in the directions parallel and
perpendicular to the static magnetic field, respectively. Because of
@xmath and @xmath for the SAW, we approximate the damping rate as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here, the relations @xmath and @xmath (in perpendicular motions, the
slow electrons, which have small Larmor radii, contribute less to the
conductivity than in parallel motions [ 12 ] ) have been used.
Equation ( 5.51 ) indicates that stronger magnetic field leads to larger
ion cyclotron frequency and thus lower damping rate. Moreover, the
damping rate can be further reduced by lowering the wave frequency. For
the gap eigenmode formed here (step-like-peak density profile), the
damping rate on axis is about @xmath , which is nearly half the width of
the resonance peak shown in Fig. 5.4 (c) (around @xmath ). The
difference may be due to the fact that Eq. ( 5.51 ) does not consider
radial boundaries but an infinite slab geometry. For the conditions
employed in [ 10 ] the damping rate is about @xmath . Thus, the
collisional dissipation on the LAPD can be controlled very low. Also, a
bigger modulation factor of the periodic magnetic field broadens the
spectral gap (see Eq. ( 5.38 )), and makes it easier to resolve the gap
eigenmode with finite damping. Detailed comparison between the
parameters employed for the present study and those in [ 10 ] is given
in Tab. 5.1 .

In this chapter, we have decreased the spatial periodicity of the
magnetic field in order to form a larger number of field ripples and
thereby remove conducting endplate boundary conditions, and employed a
stronger magnetic field to weaken @xmath and thus the effect of
collisional damping. The aim is to, for this numerical study, form a
clear spectral gap and a sharp gap eigenmode, and verify the analytical
model developed here before modelling the LAPD.

To introduce a defect to the system’s periodicity, besides powering one
magnetic coil with extremely strong current [ 10 ] , a conducting mesh
could also be inserted radially into the plasma. The mesh should have a
radial slot to prevent the formation of azimuthal current, and be
insulated from the enclosing chamber to avoid short circuiting the
plasma. Because the azimuthal electric field vanishes on the mesh (
@xmath ), this will form an odd-parity gap eigenmode. To form an
even-parity gap eigenmode, which requires @xmath , a conducting ring
with small radial thickness could be placed co-axially with the static
magnetic field. The ring should have an axial slot and be insulated from
the chamber, for the same reasons as for the mesh.

Therefore, by controlling the collisional damping rate, varying the
modulation factor, and selecting the appropriate defect, the
experimental implementation of the gap eigenmode of SAW is conceivable
on the LAPD.

### 5.5 Conclusion

The gap-mode analysis of RLH waves in the whistler frequency range [ 45
] has been generalised to ion cyclotron frequencies. We applied this
generalised analysis to SAW, whose spectral gaps and continua were
recently observed on a linear plasma device (LAPD), [ 10 ] and utilised
an electromagnetic solver [ 124 ] to model the spectral gap and gap
eigenmode. The employed conditions, such as the ratio of wave frequency
and ion cyclotron frequency, ion species, and geometry, are close to
those on the LAPD, except the radial profile of plasma density which is
step-like and chosen for precise comparison with the analytical
estimates. For a uniform magnetic field, the computed dispersion
relation qualitatively agrees with that from the generalised model.
However, they diverge more when the wave frequency is close to the ion
cyclotron frequency. This may be because the computed values of @xmath
and @xmath are no longer sufficiently small as assumed in the
theoretical analysis. For a periodic magnetic field, a clear spectral
gap is formed in both @xmath and @xmath spaces, and the gap width and
location qualitatively agree with the analytical estimates. Moreover, we
found a resonant peak inside the spectral gap when the field periodicity
is broken with a local defect. The resonant peak stands for a gap
eigenmode, which is a standing wave and with wavelength near twice the
field periodicity, a characteristic of Bragg’s reflection. The decay
length of the gap eigenmode is consistent with the analytical
prediction. We further explored the effect of the radial scale of
density jump on the gap eigenmode formation, and found that the effect
is ignorable. The collisional damping rate of SAW on the LAPD was also
calculated, for the conditions employed in [ 10 ] , and it was found
much smaller than that in our simulations. Therefore, the dissipative
processes on the LADP can be controlled at a very low level and will not
destroy the gap-mode resonance. We conclude that experimental
implementation of the gap eigenmode of SAW is conceivable on the LAPD,
providing that appropriate modulation factor and defect are selected.

## Chapter 6 Summary and recommendations for future research

The purpose of this thesis was to explore the impact of magnetic
geometry on wave modes in cylindrical plasmas. This has been achieved by
increasing the magnetic shaping on wave modes in helicon plasmas. A
two-fluid model was applied to describing plasma-driven electrostatic
drift waves in a uniform field. The model provided a consistent
description of the plasma, as well as a qualitative match to the mode
structure of spontaneously-driven electrostatic waves. The model is
amongst the first to capture the physics of flow in a helicon discharge.
The construction of a new field-pinched helicon source at the ANU
afforded the opportunity to explore the impact of a ramp in the magnetic
field on the waves and plasma. In the model, antenna-driven wave fields
led to plasma formation through the dielectric tensor and electron-ion
collisions. Wave fields in agreement with experimental data were found
with a @xmath -fold increase in the Coulomb collision frequency: this
anomalous enhancement is consistent with other works. This analysis was
amongst the first to describe the observed variation of wave field
strength and plasma density with field strength. Finally, it was shown
that the introduction of a periodic magnetic field to the system can
create gaps in the continuum of whistler and shear Alfvén modes, while
the addition of a defect to the system can create gap eigenmodes. The
opportunity to excite such modes in a simple magnetic confinement device
offers the tantalising prospect to expand the study of gap eigenmodes of
Alfvén waves from fusion to basic plasma physics.

In the remaining part of the chapter a detailed summary of each topic is
given, together with possible extensions.

### 6.1 Uniform @xmath: wave instabilities in a flowing plasma

#### 6.1.1 Summary

In Chapter 2 , a two-fluid flowing plasma model, which was developed
originally to describe wave oscillations in a vacuum arc centrifuge, [
77 , 78 , 118 ] was employed to interpret low frequency oscillations in
a RF generated linear magnetised plasma. The following conclusions were
obtained:

(1) Compared to the more rapidly rotating centrifuge plasma, the drift
wave instability, unstable at larger wavelengths, has a normalised
frequency much larger than the normalised frequency for the centrifuge.

(2) The difference between dispersion curves is principally due to the
low rotation speed of RF plasmas compared to those of the centrifuge.

(3) The measured fluctuation frequency is a factor of @xmath lower than
the predicted frequency, and the predicted trend of oscillation
frequency with field strength for inferred electron temperature matches
the data.

(4) The discrepancy between the measured and predicted fluctuation
frequencies may be attributable to the limitations of the model: assumed
temperature uniformity across plasma column and neglected effects
induced by plasma fluctuations on the externally applied field, and the
lack of measurements in the experiment: simultaneously measuring plasma
rotation profile and probe frequency and measuring the dependency of
electron temperature with field strength.

(5) The measured and predicted perturbed density profiles have a single
peak in the radial direction, indicating the perturbed mode has @xmath ,
and the peak position is in the region of maximum equilibrium density
gradient.

(6) Qualitative agreement consolidates earlier claims that the mode is a
drift mode, driven by the density gradient of the plasma.

#### 6.1.2 Recommendations for future research

Recommendations for future research regarding this topic include:

(1) generalising the electrostatic vacuum arc centrifuge model to
include magnetic field oscillations to describe electromagnetic
perturbations in a cylindrical flowing plasma (this was partly done in
the appendix),

(2) including an external drive into the generalised electromagnetic
model to describe driven modes in a flowing plasma,

(3) including radial non-uniformity into the ion and electron
temperatures to possibly reduce the @xmath -factor discrepancy between
computed and measured wave frequencies,

(4) and experimentally measuring the plasma rotation profile and probe
frequency simultaneously, and the dependence of electron temperature
with field strength.

### 6.2 Focused @xmath: wave propagations in a pinched plasma

#### 6.2.1 Summary

In Chapter 3 , an electromagnetic solver based on Maxwell’s equations
and a cold-plasma dielectric tensor was employed to describe the wave
phenomena observed in a cylindrical non-uniform helicon discharge. Here,
the non-uniformity is both radial and axial: the plasma density is
dependent on radial and axial positions, the static magnetic field
varies with axial position, and the electron temperature is a function
of radial position. The following conclusions were obtained:

(1) With an enhancement factor of @xmath to the electron-ion Coulomb
collision frequency to approximate the observed attenuation, and a
@xmath reduction in the antenna radius to match the amplitude of the
wave field, the wave solver produced consistent wave fields compared to
experimental data, including the axial and radial profiles of wave
amplitude and phase.

(2) A local minimum in the axial profiles of wave amplitude was observed
both experimentally and numerically, agreeing with previous studies. [
81 , 130 , 75 , 73 ]

(3) Mode structure of @xmath is consistent with the left hand half-turn
helical antenna being used.

(4) A possible explanation for the enhanced electron-ion collision
frequency has been offered through ion-acoustic turbulence, which can
happen if the electron drift velocity exceeds the speed of sound in
magnetised plasmas. [ 53 ]

(5) Density increasing in proportion to the static magnetic field has
little effect on RF absorption, while the density level near the antenna
affects the wave amplitude significantly at all axial locations.

(6) The axial gradient in magnetic field increases the decay length of
helicon waves in the target region.

(7) The relationship between plasma density, static magnetic field, and
axial wavelength is consistent with a simple theory developed
previously. [ 48 ]

(8) With increased electron-ion collision frequency, the wave amplitude
is lowered and more focused near the antenna, which is mainly because of
stronger edge heating at higher collision frequencies that prevent more
energy transported from the antenna into the core plasma.

(9) The wave amplitude profile at the enhanced electron-ion collision
frequency (by a factor of @xmath ), which agrees with experimental data,
shows consistent feature with a previous study that the RF energy is
almost all absorbed in the near region of the antenna rather than in the
far region. [ 74 ]

(10) The antiparallel feature that wave energy is larger on the opposite
side of the antenna relative to the direction of static magnetic field
has been observed both numerically and experimentally, and is consistent
with previous observations made in uniform field configurations. [ 74 ,
48 , 133 , 53 ]

#### 6.2.2 Recommendations for future research

Recommendations for future research regarding this topic include:

(1) further explaining exactly how an axially non-uniform field might
affect the radially localised helicon mode, [ 35 ]

(2) including different azimuthal mode numbers in the glass layer and
any subsequent coupling to the plasma at the plasma-glass interface;
this will possibly increase the computed wave signal which is currently
weaker than measurement,

(3) identifying independent first and second radial modes that superpose
to yield a local minimum in wave field amplitude,

(4) measuring the axial profile of plasma density, and the plasma
density and electromagnetic wave field with a reversed static magnetic
field,

(5) and modelling a diverged plasma configuration which may be of
interest for plasma thruster applications.

### 6.3 Rippled @xmath: gap eigenmodes of RLH waves and SAW

#### 6.3.1 Summary

In Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 , spectral gaps of RLH waves and SAW were
investigated in a plasma cylinder with periodic magnetic field, and
discrete eigenmodes were formed inside their gaps by introducing a
defect to the field periodicity. The following conclusions were
obtained:

(1) Longitudinal modulation of the guiding magnetic field in a plasma
column creates a spectral gap, which prohibits wave propagation along
the column when the driving frequency of the RF antenna is in the
forbidden range.

(2) The calculated width and location of the gap are consistent with
analytical estimates.

(3) A discrete eigenmode can been formed inside the spectral gap by
introducing a local defect to the periodic structure.

(4) Both the theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate two types
of gap eigenmode in the “imperfect” system: odd-parity mode and
even-parity mode, depending the type of the defect employed.

(5) The gap mode is localised around the defect and represents a
standing wave rather than travelling wave.

(6) The distinctive feature of the gap eigenmode is a resonant peak in
the plasma response to the antenna current.

(7) The gap eigenmode has two characteristic spatial scales: a short
inner scale which is nearly twice the system’s periodicity and
characteristic for Bragg’s reflection, and a smooth envelope which
depends on the modulation amplitude and scales roughly as the inverse
width of the spectral gap.

(8) Experimental identifications of the gap eigenmodes of RLH waves and
SAW are conceivable on the LAPD.

#### 6.3.2 Recommendations for future research

Recommendations for future research regarding this topic include:

(1) identifying the gap eigenmodes of RLH waves and SAW in a linear
plasma device, e. g. LAPD, which if succeed will pave the way to further
studying the interaction between gap eigenmode and energetic particles:
important for energetic particle confinement in fusion plasmas,

(2) including continuum damping into the gap-mode analysis of SAW and
further studying its effect on the gap eigenmode formation.
