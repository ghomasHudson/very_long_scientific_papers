The thesis deals with holomorphic germs $ \Phi: (\mathbb{C}^2, 0) \to
(\mathbb{C}^3,0) $ singular only at the origin, with a special emphasis on the
distinguished class of finitely determined germs. The results are published in
two articles (arXiv:1404.2853 and arXiv:1902.01229), joint with Andr\'{a}s
N\'{e}methi. In Chapter 3 of the thesis we study the associated immersion $ S^3
\looparrowright S^5 $, while Chapter 5 contains an algorithm providing the
Milnor fibre boundary of the non-isolated hypersurface singularity determined
by the image of $ \Phi $. These results create bridges between different areas
of complex singularity theory and immersion theory. The background of these
topics is summerized in Chapter 1, 2 and 4.
