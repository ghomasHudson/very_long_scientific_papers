# Contributions

The author and his collaborators have made the respective contributions
to the results presented in this work. They are listed following the
structure of the Thesis as presented in the outline.

##### Relativistic quantum information

These results are based on the papers published in Phys. Rev. D 84 ,
104043 (2011) and Class Quantum Grav. 29 , 224011 (2012). The idea of
deriving a gauge invariant phase for closed paths came from A/Prof.
Daniel Terno. I did the calculations for the explicit form of the phase.
The discussions on quantum experiments in space were initially suggested
by A/Prof. Thomas Jennewein and Prof. Raymond Laflamme. A/Prof. Terno
and I contributed to section 3 of the review paper, which accounts for
the relativistic effects in quantum information theory. We performed the
analysis of relative magnitudes of the effects within the parameters of
the QEYSSAT mission.

##### Gaussian states

I have written a pedagogical review on Gaussian states, arXiv:1209.2748,
where I focus on the entanglement properties of such states, analyzing
in particular the form of the covariance matrix and symplectic
eigenvalues for a pair of coupled quantum harmonic oscillators.

##### Continuous-variable topological order

The idea of detecting topological order using continuous-variable
systems was the result of fruitful discussions between A/Prof. Gavin
Brennen and myself. I proposed to calculate the topological entanglement
entropy for a lattice of oscillators using the Gaussian states formalism
and Dr. Nicolas Menicucci introduced us to the graphical calculus for
Gaussian states. I derived the form of the covariance matrix for the
continuous-variable physical surface code state and did all the
numerical simulations and graphs presented here. A/Prof. Brennen and I
calculated the gap for the surface code state, while A/Prof. Brennen
derived the bound for the decay of the correlations. I proposed to test
topological order using the topological logarithmic negativity and did
the related calculations. A/Prof. Brennen, Dr. Menicucci and I
constructed the noise model and derived the related covariance matrix.
Dr. Menicucci and I derived the analytical bound for the topological
mutual information, while A/Prof. Brennen suggested how to derive the
bound for the topological entanglement entropy and I did the
calculations. The experimental proposals at the end of chapter 6 are due
to the visionary ideas of Dr. Menicucci and his collaborators. These
results are presented in arXiv:1305.0409v3, while the manuscript has
been submitted to the New Journal of Physics.

##### Entropy in polymer quantization

The idea of studying the behavior of entropy in different quantization
schemes is due to A/Prof. Terno and was the original project of my PhD.
I first proposed to use Gaussian states as an example and did the
calculations for the entropy of two coupled oscillators quantized in the
polymer scheme, which then helped us to derive the precise entropy
bonds. A/Prof. Terno introduced me to the representation theory of
canonical commutation relations that were the basis for the proofs of
the entropy bounds, which have been derived jointly by the two of us.
These results have been published in Class. Quantum Grav. 30 , 135006
(2013).

    bound for the topological mutual information (TMI) @xmath for noisy
    state preparation modeled as a mapping from a thermal state of the
    cluster-state Hamiltonian in the high-temperature limit (note that
    this is not the TMI for a thermal state of the surface code
    Hamiltonian.) The main graph shows the maximum single-mode squeezing
    of @xmath dB achieved to date [ 8 , 9 ] . Finally the dashed line
    corresponds to TEE for the CV cluster-state, which is always zero.

-    C.1 Simplified network of modes with which to derive an upper bound
    on the TEE for the CV surface code: (a) This shows a surface code
    state for a quantum double model with discrete variables. There are
    six vertices, two faces, and seven edges where physical modes
    reside. Not all the vertex stabilizers are independent. Rather,
    their product is the identity, so the number of independent
    stabilizers is @xmath , equal to the number of physical modes. We
    can deform the lattice while preserving the topological order by
    replacing three modes of each face, excluding the mode on the shared
    boundary, with one mode as shown in (b). This network has two
    independent vertex stabilizers, and two independent face stabilizers
    which equals the number of physical modes. For the toric code, the
    network represents a ground state that is a GHZ state. (c) A
    finitely squeezed cluster-state graph with seven modes maps to the
    three-mode network by measuring the grey modes in the @xmath basis
    and the black modes in the @xmath basis. In fact, the nullifiers on
    the top and bottom black modes of the graph act equivalently on the
    white modes meaning one of them is redundant. Therefore, an even
    simpler CV cluster-state graph suffices as depicted in (d). Upon
    measurements, the reduced network has three modes with a correlation
    matrix that can be computed exactly to yield an upper bound to the
    CV surface code TEE.
-    C.2 Regions used for the TMI calculations. Note that they are the
    same as those used by Kitaev and Preskill [ 6 ] for the definition
    of the TEE, but since the state is mixed now also the external
    region D needs to be considered.

## Chapter 1 Introduction

Quantum mechanics was introduced at the beginning of the last century as
a radical new theory, defining the space where physics takes place and
the rules that physical systems are required to obey at the very cold
and small scales [ 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ] . This
astonishing novel concept, together with the newly born theory of
relativity [ 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 ] , turned the rational idea of
classical physics on its head, completely changing our understanding of
the laws of physics. This was the first quantum revolution . Despite the
innumerable experimental confirmations of quantum theory, foundational
questions such as the resolution of the measurement problem (the
macroscopic transition from quantum to classical) remain [ 24 ] .

The “second quantum revolution” kicked off at the end of the last
century when researchers started to wonder wether it was possible to
obtain a better understanding of the laws of the quantum world looking
at information theory through the lenses of quantum mechanics (and
vice-versa). While the seminal proposals for a quantum computer are
familiarly attributed to Feynman [ 25 ] and Deutsch [ 26 ] , it was not
until Shor’s factorization algorithm [ 27 ] , which gave the shivers to
every cryptographers on the planet, that these ideas led to a new view
of the role played by information in physics, giving birth to the
fascinating field of quantum information. As a result, the past 25 years
have been a prosperous time for the physicists interested in
understanding how to exploit the quantum mechanical properties of nature
in order to accomplish computational and operational tasks that would be
incredibly onerous in terms of classical physical resources, if not
practically impossible [ 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 ] . Today, in parallel with
discoveries in quantum information theory, experimentalists have reached
an extraordinary level of control over single and composite quantum
systems [ 32 ] , opening up the doors to the world of large scale fully
quantum devices and the related applications and implications [ 33 , 31
] .

In this Thesis, we pursue investigations to some of the open problems in
present-day quantum information and quantum computation theory,
analyzing geometrical and topological properties of both discrete and
continuous quantum information systems. Roughly speaking this work is
divided in three parts, preceded by a general introduction to the
concepts of quantum mechanics, quantum information, relativity and loop
quantum gravity.

The first part, Chapter 3 , deals with photons in curved space-time [ 34
, 35 ] . While photons can be used as physical realizations for qubits [
31 ] , the basic elements in quantum information, it is still not
entirely understood how the presence of a gravitational field affects
the information stored in the polarization of a single photon [ 1 ] .
Taking into account these effects is particularly important when
designing schemes of quantum communication between Earth and orbiting
satellites [ 2 ] . Moreover, future tests of general relativity
involving quantum systems will rely on precise estimations of the
relativistic effects on the quantum degrees of freedom [ 36 ] . After a
brief account of the relativistic description of the system, we will
focus on polarization rotation in closed trajectories on a curved
space-time, detecting interesting invariants and suggesting possible
experimental applications for these effects.

Chapters 4 - 6 account for the second part of the Thesis. We first
introduce the notions of Gaussian states [ 3 , 37 ] and topological
order [ 38 ] and then combine them together into the new concept of
continuous-variable topological order [ 5 ] . In general, topology
refers to the ability of relating systems whose shape look different at
a first glance. By analyzing common geometrical properties, one extracts
quantities that are used to characterize the global properties of
otherwise very different-looking systems. Topological quantum
computation is the area of quantum information that studies the
topological properties of a special class of two-dimensional system,
also called topologically ordered [ 39 , 40 ] . These systems are
particularly fascinating because they can support anyons [ 41 ] ,
unusual quasi-particles that are neither bosons nor fermions and whose
very non-local properties enable the implementation of fault-tolerant
quantum computation via braiding operations [ 42 , 43 ] . Performing
quantum computation using anyons does not require the physical
implementation of quantum gates, whose action is now replaced by the
spatial exchange of anyons. While very appealing from a theoretical
point of view, the experimental realization of topological systems based
on qubits (or qudits) is highly challenging, due to the level of control
needed to build a lattice of interacting spins [ 5 ] .

We present here an alternative approach that allows for a much simpler
realization in the laboratory with today’s technology. Starting from the
toric code state, defined as the ground state of an highly-entangled
lattice of qubits, we introduce its continuous-variable surface code
state analog, replacing qubits with light field modes, which are
described mathematically by Gaussian states. This choice is motivated
both by the easy mathematical formalism that characterizes Gaussian
states, which allows for a straightforward description of the state in
terms of its first and second statistical moments [ 44 ] , and the
availability of well-developed experimental techniques [ 45 ] .
Exploiting the Gaussianity of the state, one can prove that the
continuous-variable surface code exhibits topological order by detecting
a non-zero topological entanglement entropy, which is the distinctive
feature of topological phases [ 6 , 7 ] . Remarkably, this can be
achieved simply performing measurements of the quadrature operators of
the light modes. Furthermore, this system requires only two-body
nearest-neighbor interactions for its creation, and hence opens up to
scalable implementations using, for instance, quantum optics [ 46 , 47 ]
or circuit-QED technology [ 48 , 49 ] .

Since the identification of topological order in topological quantum
computation theory is strictly related to the entropic properties of the
system [ 40 ] , in the third and last part of this Thesis, Chapter 7 ,
there will be space to investigate the well-definiteness of the concept
of entropy in different quantization schemes. In particular, we will be
dealing with polymer quantization [ 50 ] , a representation of the
Weyl-Heisenberg group unitarily inequivalent to the standard Schrödinger
quantization [ 51 , 52 ] , which was introduced as a toy model to study
the kinematic and the dynamic of 1-dimensional quantum systems in
analogy with the more complicated setup of Loop Quantum Gravity [ 53 ,
54 , 55 ] .

While there are ways to demonstrate that physical observables in
Schrödinger and polymer quantizations converge to the same value in the
appropriate limit [ 56 , 57 ] , analysis of the quantum entropy in the
two schemes was missing. Specifically, it was not clear for a quantum
state whose observable predictions in the two unitarily inequivalent
quantization schemes are close, whether the values of the entropy will
also be close or not [ 4 ] .

Here we give an answer to this question, establishing the conditions for
entropy convergence. Gaussian states happen to be particularly useful
also in this context. By looking at the entropy of two coupled quantum
harmonic oscillators, it is relatively easy to construct an example that
confirms our findings and allows us to show explicitly how the
corrections introduced by the discretization of the physical space
affect the value of the entropy.

### 1.1 Outline

Our intent is to give a uniform flow to the discussion, alternating
necessary background and new results. This Thesis has three main parts,
with four appendices presenting detailed calculations and additional
useful theoretical background. Briefly, this is the outline of the work.

-   General introduction to the concepts of the Thesis:
    Chapter 2 summarizes the essential facts of quantum mechanics,
    quantum information, relativity and quantum gravity needed for an
    effective comprehension of this Thesis. We first start with some
    basic structural ideas of quantum mechanics. Then we review the
    properties of entropy for classical and quantum systems, and
    introduce entanglement together with ways to quantify it in pure and
    mixed states. After introducing the stabilizer formalism, this
    Chapter is concluded with general concepts of relativistic quantum
    information and a short section about loop quantum gravity.

-   Part 1 - Geometric phase of photons:
    The first part of the Thesis is based on the results from [ 1 ] and
    [ 2 ] . We discuss the gauge-invariance of the polarization phase
    for photons traveling along closed trajectories in closed paths.

    -   Chapter 3 : Here we start explaining the relativistic effects on
        the states of a photon and their dependence on the choice of a
        well-suited reference frame. Then we introduce the geometric
        meaning of polarization phase through the derivation of an
        alternative equation for the phase in a static space-time,
        written in terms of the bundle connection. One can then prove
        that in a closed trajectory the change in polarization depends
        only on the geometrical properties of the space-time and not on
        the choice of reference frame. The Chapter is concluded with
        some remarks about experimental applications of quantum
        information in space.

-   Part 2 - Topological order with Gaussian states:
    The second part is based on [ 3 , 5 ] and analyses the interplay
    between Gaussian states and topologically ordered phases.

    -   Chapter 4 : In this Chapter we rigorously introduce the
        mathematical description of Gaussian states, starting with the
        Hilbert space and phase space representations of such states,
        and continuing with the state evolution under symplectic
        transformations. Then a step-by-step derivation of the
        entanglement entropy formula for pure Gaussian states is
        presented, together with an example. To conclude, we introduce
        the graphical calculus for Gaussian states and give some
        examples of graphical representations of common experimental
        Gaussian procedures. This Chapter is based on the review [ 3 ] .

    -   Chapter 5 : This Chapter serves as an introduction to the most
        common physical codes used in the theory of topological quantum
        computation. After a brief account of quantum lattice systems,
        we give a concise explanation of the cluster-states and surface
        code states, explaining how to detect topological order by means
        of appropriate witnesses, both in the case of pure and mixed
        states.

    -   Chapter 6 : After the two chapters of introduction and
        motivation, here we present the results from [ 5 ] . We start
        this Chapter introducing the continuous-variable states that are
        used in the analysis, carefully describing all the properties of
        the physical continuous-variable surface code state. This is the
        analog of the toric code state, constructed by means of
        interacting light modes instead of qubits and described by
        Gaussian states formalism. We use the graphical calculus for
        Gaussian states to derive an explicit form of the covariance
        matrix of the state and from that we calculate the value of the
        topological entanglement entropy, which proves that the state
        exists in a topological phase. We conclude with the analysis of
        a noise model for the surface code and describe possible
        experimental implementations for this model.

-   Part 3 - Entropy in polymer quantization:
    The third and last part of this Thesis follows the results from [ 4
    ] , where we studied entropy in different quantization schemes.

    -   Chapter 7 : We start explaining the concept of algebraic quantum
        theory: this is done introducing @xmath -algebras and posing the
        conditions for the physical equivalence of two representations
        of the same algebra. After reviewing polymer quantization, a
        representation of the Weyl-Heisenberg algebra, we use the
        properties of entropy to analyze its convergence in two
        different quantization schemes, specifically polymer and
        Schrödinger quantization. We then derive a general bound that
        relates entropies of physically equivalent states in unitarily
        inequivalent representations and conclude with an example where
        we employ Gaussian states to calculate the bipartite
        entanglement entropy of two coupled oscillators in polymer
        quantization.

-   Conclusions and appendices:

    -   Chapter 8 presents the results of this work in a concise manner,
        highlighting connections between different areas and open
        questions.

    -   Appendix A is a short summary of differential geometry. It
        contains explanations of all the concepts used to derive the
        photon polarization equations in Chapter 3 .

    -   In Appendix B we first set the rules and then derive the
        nullifier sets that are used in Chapter 6 to describe the
        continuous-variable code states.

    -   An upper bound for the topological entanglement entropy in the
        CV surface code is derived in Appendix C , together with an
        explicit proof of the lower bound formula for the topological
        mutual information. These results are based on [ 5 ] .

    -   Appendix D presents explicit calculations of the canonical
        operators expectation values in polymer quantization. These are
        used to calculate the value of the entropy in the coupled
        harmonic oscillators example illustrated in Chapter 7 .

## Chapter 2 Thesis’ Prolegomena

This Thesis starts with a minimal review of all the relevant
mathematical definitions and physical features that will be used in the
following Chapters ¹ ¹ 1 We acknowledge [ 58 ] for inspiring the title
of this Chapter. . We begin with a short introduction to quantum
mechanics, defining the basic concepts of Hilbert space, quantum states,
physical observables and measurements [ 31 , 59 ] . Then we move to
information theory, focusing in particular on the concept of entropy and
information [ 60 ] . First we offer a parallel view of different
information measures both in classical and quantum physics, secondly we
specifically list the required properties of the quantum entropy. We
then introduce the paradigmatic notion of entanglement [ 61 ] ,
clarifying the meaning of bipartite entanglement and presenting a number
of quantities that are normally used to quantify the quantum
correlations shared between two systems [ 62 ] . The next notion to be
described is the stabilizer formalism [ 63 ] , a method that can be used
to simplify the description of quantum many-body systems on a lattice.
This method is important for us because these are the systems that will
be employed in the discussion of topological order for
continuous-variables [ 5 ] in Chapter 6 .

After that, we take our quantum systems up to space, where in addition
to the quantum theory we also need the laws of relativistic quantum
information [ 34 , 2 ] . There, we investigate the behavior of quantum
information enclosed into the degrees of freedom of photons traveling a
curved space-time [ 1 ] . Therefore, in this Introduction we succinctly
describe the physics of massless point-like particles in special
relativity, in order to simplify the subsequent extension to general
relativity in Chapter 3 .

Eventually, we conclude this introductory Chapter spending few words
about quantum gravity and specifically loop quantum gravity [ 54 , 64 ,
65 ] , one of the most promising attempts to derive a theory that
encloses both quantum mechanics and general relativity. Loop quantum
gravity is one of the main motivations to examine entropy in different
quantization schemes [ 50 , 4 ] , as we do in Chapter 7 .

### 2.1 Basic elements of quantum mechanics for quantum information

The protagonist of quantum information is the quantum bit, or qubit [ 31
] . As the name suggests, the qubit is the conceptual extension of a
classical bit to the quantum world, where physical states can exist in a
unique condition known as superposition of states. Classically, a bit is
the basic unit of information, which physically corresponds to a system
that can exist in two different states, traditionally called zero and
one . Start with a (fair) coin, and flip it in the air. It will fall
showing you either the head ( @xmath ) or the tail ( @xmath ). This is
the street version of a bit. The concept of qubit is built upon similar
considerations, but it is now implemented by a 2-level quantum state and
exhibits some extra features that cannot be found in classical physics.
Before clarifying what the last sentence means, let me explain briefly
part of the terminology we will adopt.

Traditionally (any quantum mechanics book is a good source for the
details presented here, see for example [ 31 , 59 , 66 ] ), quantum
mechanics tells us that a (quantum) system is described by a unit
vector, or state, that belongs to an Hilbert space . Hilbert spaces are
a class of @xmath -dimensional complex vector spaces with certain
additional properties. First of all they are equipped with a positive
definite scalar product ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is a continuous map conventionally anti-linear in the first
argument and linear in the second argument. Using the inner product one
can introduce the concept of norm of an element @xmath as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Furthermore, a Hilbert space is a complete inner product space, meaning
that all the Cauchy sequences in @xmath converge to a value in @xmath .

A qubit state lives in a 2-dimensional Hilbert space spanned by some
(vector) basis that we choose to label

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

in analogy with the classical description of the bit states @xmath ,
where the symbol @xmath is called a ket and is the standard depiction
for a (pure) state of a quantum system. As mentioned before, quantum
mechanics actually tells us more: A qubit can exist in states that are
linear superpositions of the basis states, such as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the absolute value of the coefficients, namely amplitudes , (
@xmath and @xmath ) correspond to the normalized probabilities of
finding the state @xmath in one of the two possible outcomes @xmath ,
@xmath after an appropriate measurement. For future references, we call
the basis @xmath , @xmath with the established name of computational
basis . In Eq.( 2.4 ) lies (part of) the real power of quantum
computation. Quantum states can exist as linear combinations of other
quantum states, weighted with different amplitudes. Notice also that,
although the amount of information that can be extracted from a qubit is
exactly the same of a classical bit, one bit, the quantum superposition
principle or more generally the linearity of quantum mechanics, allows
us to perform pre-measurement operations on qubits that are in no way
possible for classical systems.

In the ket formalism, the inner product is rewritten as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the element @xmath is called bra and is the vector dual to the ket
@xmath . Duality is a basic concept in algebra and in differential
geometry. It will be discussed with more rigor later in the introduction
and in Appendix A . To generalize the inner product, introduce an
orthonormal basis @xmath defined on some Hilbert space @xmath and
consider any two vectors @xmath , @xmath , then we have that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

The following concept we require to introduce is the representation of
physical observables in quantum mechanics. In the quantum regime,
physical (classical) observables, as position, momentum and energy, are
associated to (quantum) operators that act on quantum states. When one
represents quantum states by kets, any observable operator is given by a
hermitian matrix @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath is the Hermitian
adjoint of @xmath . Every Hermitian matrix has real eigenvalues, and for
an operator they correspond to the values that the associated physical
observable can acquire after a measurement. The expectation value of
some observable @xmath in the state @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

and if @xmath , the quantities

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

are the matrix elements of the observable @xmath .

The temporal evolution of a closed quantum system from a time @xmath to
a time @xmath is given by some unitary operator @xmath , such that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

and @xmath , where @xmath is the unit operator. The unitarity condition
immediately implies that @xmath . Unitary operators can be seen as gates
acting on one or many-qubit state, evolving it accordingly to their
properties. Among the most important 1-qubit gates are the Pauli
operators :

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.10)
  -- -- -- --------

For instance, it is trivial to see that the @xmath operator swaps the
computational basis vectors

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Pauli matrices, together with the unit operator @xmath , taken with
multiplicative factors @xmath form a group closed under matrix
multiplication [ 67 ] , called the qubit Pauli group . Its extension to
@xmath -qubits is at the basis of the stabilizer formalism [ 31 ] and
the generalization [ 68 ] to quantum-modes [ 45 ] , to be specified
later, plays a fundamental part in our future treatment of
continuous-variable topological phases in Chapter 6 .

It is worth pointing out that an alternative basis to the computational
basis is the conjugate basis

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the two basis are related by the Hadamard operation;

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

Measurements in quantum mechanics are a tricky business. If we write the
desired observable @xmath on a orthogonal basis

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

then the outcome of a measurement can solely be one of the eigenvalues
@xmath of the linear decomposition. Specifically, the probability to
obtain @xmath for a state @xmath is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

The measurement operators @xmath are also known as projectors , and they
satisfy the completeness equation @xmath and @xmath . After a
measurement @xmath with outcome @xmath , the state of the system, which
initially was @xmath collapses into the state

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath if @xmath .

States that can be labelled by a ket, as the ones treated so far, are
called pure states . All the required information for their description
is encoded in @xmath . Whenever we are ignorant about the description of
a state, we are only allowed to treat it statistically as an ensemble of
pure states with different probability amplitudes. This is the density
matrix of a system, defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath probability of the system to be in @xmath . If there exists
a base where @xmath , then @xmath and the state is pure. For pure
states, the density matrix language is analogous to the ket language. If
this condition is not satisfied, then the state is mixed and cannot be
represented by a ket.

In the density matrix representation the conservation of probability is
given by the obvious relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

and each density matrix is a positive operator such that, given a ket
@xmath , the following inequality always holds

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

The expectation value of an observable with respect to @xmath is
expressed by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

while the action of an unitary operator @xmath on the density matrix is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the time evolution of @xmath obeys the following equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath time-dependent Hamiltonian of the system.

Let me recall that this description of quantum mechanics, named after
Heisenberg [ 12 , 13 ] , is completely equivalent to the formulation
introduced by Schrödinger [ 15 ] , where kets are replaced by wave
functions @xmath and physical observables are equivalent to differential
operators.

### 2.2 Entropy and its properties

Statistical thermodynamics, quantum mechanics and information theory
promoted entropy from an auxiliary variable of the mechanical theory of
heat [ 69 , 70 ] to one of the most important quantities in science [ 71
] . In the field of information theory, entropy plays a most fundamental
role: It quantifies the amount of uncertainty, or lack of information,
the observer has over a system [ 31 , 72 ] . Classically, entropy is a
concept associated to the probability distribution of a classical
variable, while in the quantum regime entropy is a function of the
density matrix of the state [ 60 ] . In the following, we will first
introduce different classical statistical functions and then present
their quantum counterparts.

#### 2.2.1 Classical world

In classical information theory, the basic measure of uncertainty is the
Shannon entropy [ 73 ] . Given a random variable @xmath , the Shannon
entropy quantifies how much we do not know about the variable @xmath
before we learn its value. Less prosaically, if the variable @xmath can
take @xmath different values, each of them with a certain probability
@xmath , such that @xmath is the probability distribution of the
variable @xmath , then the Shannon entropy is defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

and it is maximized by a uniform distribution with all equal @xmath .

The Shannon entropy is the lower parametrical limit of a one parameter
family of entropies known as Rényi- @xmath entropies [ 73 , 60 ] ,
defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the limit @xmath , one recovers the Shannon entropy for @xmath .
Fruitfully, for each value of @xmath the Rényi entropy vanishes for
@xmath and it acquires its maximum value for the uniform distribution.

Given two variables @xmath and @xmath with probability distributions
@xmath and @xmath , there exists a measure that quantifies how different
these distributions are. This is called the relative entropy [ 72 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

and it is related to the rate at which, in the limit of very large
sampling, one can safely identify if we are sampling from the @xmath or
@xmath distribution.

The last concept we wish to introduce at this point is a quantity that
tells us something about how much information two distributions have in
common. This is the mutual information [ 31 ] . Classically, the mutual
information is a quantity associated to the probability distributions of
two classical variables @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

Intuitively, the mutual information describes how much information about
@xmath we learn by measuring the value of @xmath . If the two quantities
are not correlated, then it simply reduces to the Shannon entropy of
@xmath .

#### 2.2.2 Quantum world

The quantum analog of the Shannon entropy is the von Neumann entropy, or
quantum entropy [ 74 ] . It is constructed replacing the classical
probability distribution with the closest quantum concept, i.e. the
density matrix ( 2.17 ) of the quantum state, generically @xmath . Thus,
given @xmath , its von Neumann entropy is defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the set of the eigenspectrum of @xmath . From this last
definition, it is trivial to realize that for a pure state @xmath since
@xmath the von Neumann entropy is always identically zero. Therefore,
only non-pure states have non-vanishing von Neumann entropy, whose
greatest value @xmath is given by the maximally mixed state ( @xmath ).

The quantum version of the relative entropy for two states @xmath is
defined as [ 73 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

In analogy with the classical case, it says something about the
statistical distinguishability between the two states @xmath and @xmath
. Operationally, larger the value of the relative entropy, greater is
the amount of information we can extract when performing a measurement
aimed at distinguish the two states.

In complete analogy with the classical case, one can construct a family
of quantum Rényi entropies for @xmath with @xmath [ 73 ] ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the von Neumann entropy @xmath is given by the @xmath limit. Rényi
entropies are particularly appealing because the full family contains
information about the (entanglement) spectrum of the state @xmath ,
which is more than the information given by the only entanglement
entropy. Furthermore, Rényi entropies showed to be useful in the
treatment of topologically ordered systems, offering an alternative way
to identify topological phases [ 75 ] .

The quantum mutual information for two states @xmath and @xmath is
defined substituting the Shannon entropy in the classical definition
with the von Neumann entropy [ 31 ] ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

The quantum mutual information is the most used measure to quantify
correlations in mixed states, since it captures the total amount of
information between the two subsystems, both in the classical and
quantum case. It will be useful when dealing with mixed states of
topologically ordered quantum systems.

Before proceeding, it is necessary to say something about the spaces
where a state is defined. So far we have been dealing with density
matrices @xmath implicitly associated to an Hilbert space @xmath .
However, we will mostly consider situations where states are defined on
the tensor product of two or more Hilbert space. In this sense, systems
made of @xmath subsystems each associated to an individual Hilbert
spaces @xmath are described by states that live in the composite product
space

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

For instance, if @xmath lives in @xmath , then the subsystem defined on
@xmath is described by the reduced density matrix @xmath . This is
derived tracing out all the degrees of freedom associated to @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

and, conversely, @xmath .

#### 2.2.3 Everything you always wanted to know about the von Neumann
entropy but were afraid to ask

At this point you should be convinced that quantum entropy is a rather
significant and interesting quantity. It is not by any means an
observable of the system, i.e. there is no quantum mechanical operator
whose expectation value is the entropy. Quantum entropy is instead a
functional of the state, just like in classical theory. From Eq.( 2.27 )
it is evident that for a generic quantum state @xmath one has

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

Moreover, @xmath only if the rank of @xmath is finite and vice-versa.

We will now list some of the basic properties of the von Neumann entropy
[ 60 ] that will be useful hereinafter. A good starting point is to
notice that the entropy of a quantum state is invariant under unitary
evolution of the state. For a unitary transformation @xmath , this
property translates into

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

If one considers a direct product state @xmath given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

then the total entropy is equivalent to the sum of the entropies of the
single constituents:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

This property is called additivity of the entropy. If we now limit
ourselves to two Hilbert spaces such that @xmath (but the following is
easily generalizable to more dimensions) then we can introduce another
property of the entropy called subadditivity .

To define subadditivity, consider the joint state state @xmath of two
lower dimensional density matrices as in Eq.( 2.32 ), with

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then the following inequalities hold

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.38)
              @xmath      (2.39)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

where the latter is known as the triangle inequality.

An interesting immediate consequence of this is that for a global pure
state @xmath , the quantum entropy of a subsystem @xmath of @xmath can
still be non-zero and quantifies the degree of entanglement , a special
kind of correlations unique to quantum systems. From subadditivity,
another property of the entropy follows. This is the concavity [ 76 ] ,
which implies that the total entropy of a mixed state is always bigger
or equal to the weighted sum of the single entropies of the composing
elements, i.e. for @xmath , then

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

Physically, this last inequality is telling us that by sampling from a
mixture of state we also lose information by not knowing from which
state we sample. Using concavity, it is possible to derive an
upper-bound for @xmath [ 77 ] . This will be used later when discussing
the convergence of entropy in different quantization schemes, namely

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the Shannon entropy of the probability distribution
@xmath . In the special case where the states @xmath are all
one-dimensional projections, a fancy way to say that they can be written
as @xmath , then Eq.( 2.41 ) reduces to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

The equality in ( 2.41 ) is satisfied when the @xmath have support on
orthogonal subspaces.

For infinitely dimensional Hilbert spaces, entropy as a function of
@xmath is generally a discontinuous quantity and small variations of the
density matrix can induce a discontinuous jump in the value of the
entropy. For finite-dimensional systems this change is bounded by the
Fannes’ inequality [ 78 ] : Taken two density matrices @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the trace distance between the two density matrices. A
continuity property for the entropy is the lower semicontinuity . Given
a sequence of density matrices @xmath that weakly converge to the
density matrix @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

i.e. all matrix elements satisfy @xmath , then the entropy @xmath is
upper bounded by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

Furthermore, the weakly convergence for density matrices also implies
that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

When the trace distance relation above ( 2.46 ) holds, together with the
convergence of the energy expectation values,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

then the following continuity property is satisfied

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

The continuity conditions can be relaxed when we consider bounded
Hamiltonians,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

for all @xmath such that @xmath , in which case the entropy @xmath is
automatically continuous in the sense of Eq.( 2.48 ) for all density
matrices @xmath associated to finite energy [ 60 ] , i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

### 2.3 My name is Verschränkung, but you can call me Entanglement

In 1935, the EPR trio Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen, realized that
quantum description allows for local operations performed on part of a
global system to affect the state of another part of the system
indefinitely separated in space [ 79 ] . Whereas the ghost of the
verschränkung, the term coined by Schrödinger to describe this wonder of
Nature, haunted Einstein till the end of his life, today entanglement is
widely recognized as the distinctive trademark of quantum mechanics and
arguably the main ingredient in quantum information processing [ 61 ] .

Beyond its elusive nature, entanglement reveals itself as a non-local
more-than-classical kind of correlations among two (or more) quantum
states. Practically, we say that a state is entangled if it is not
separable [ 31 ] . A pure state @xmath is separable if it can be written
as the direct product of states of the subsystems,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath . Physically, separability has a direct
connection to locality, meaning that different parts of a pure separable
state can be prepared locally and the outcomes of local measurements on
the subsystems are independent. The easiest example, for the two-qubit
Hilbert space @xmath , consists of the Bell basis ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

These states are entangled, because they cannot be written as the
product of two states

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

Similarly, a mixed state is separable if its global density matrix can
be written as a convex sum of product states,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

as shown in [ 80 ] . If this is not possible, then the state is
entangled.

Entanglement might well be considered the quintessence of quantum
mechanics, or its quantessence ² ² 2 I apologize for the terrible joke.
. Apart from being rather interesting as a phenomenon per se ,
entanglement proved to be an additional physical resource exclusive of
the quantum regime. One of the first and most fascinating examples where
entanglement was used to achieve something otherwise impossible in
classical physics was quantum teleportation [ 29 ] . Following that
successful application, it was understood that entanglement could be
used to perform tasks within quantum information, such as quantum
computing, super-dense coding and quantum cryptography [ 28 , 61 ] .

Interestingly enough, it is extremely challenging to quantify and
identify correlations, quantum or classical, between subsystems of a
larger system and a unique characterization of the degree of
entanglement of a system (assuming this last sentence makes physical
sense) still does not exist [ 62 ] . The classification of correlations
and the appropriate choice of measures goes beyond the scopes of this
Thesis, so they are not treated here. However, we still need to define a
few measures of entanglement that will be used in the following
Chapters. A criterion to determine whether a quantity is a meaningful
entanglement witness or not was derived in [ 81 ] . It states that any
quantity that does not increase on average under local operations and
classical communication (LOCC) is an entanglement monotone , and can be
meaningfully used to quantify entanglement. The physical reason behind
this idea is that entanglement cannot increase when we limit ourselves
to operations performed locally (a mathematical motivation follows from
Nielsen’s majorization theorem, see [ 82 ] ).

In the following section we start with the quantification of bipartite
entanglement in the case of pure states and then extend the same concept
to mixed states.

#### 2.3.1 Bipartite entanglement of pure states

For pure states, entanglement manifests itself as disorder in the
subsystems of the entangled system. Consider the pure state @xmath ,
divide it into two complementary subsystems @xmath and @xmath and hand
them to the most revered quantum couple of all times, Alice and Bob (a
strictly not necessary but always enjoyable step to do). The preferred
measure to quantify the amount of entanglement between any @xmath
bipartition held by the two lovers ³ ³ 3 I believe that every quantum
physicist likes to think that between Alice and Bob there is something
more than just entanglement (although things get kinky when Eve gets
involved). is the entanglement entropy , or degree of entanglement,
which is equivalent to the von Neumann entropy of any of the two
partitions (see [ 31 , 61 , 3 ] )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

If the subsystems @xmath and @xmath are in a product state, then no
entanglement is present and hence @xmath . Otherwise, the quantum
correlations along the cut induce a positive value of the von Neumann
entropy. Although the entanglement entropy is an appropriate measure of
entanglement for pure states, it does not have any particular physical
interpretation for mixed states.

#### 2.3.2 Negativity and logarithmic negativity

While quantum mutual information takes in account all kind of
correlations, a measure that manages to capture solely the quantum
correlations for mixed states is the negativity [ 83 ] , which is based
on Peres’ criterion to determine if a mixed state @xmath is entangled
between @xmath and @xmath . The criterion says that for any (bipartite)
separable state, taken the general form of the density matrix

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

then the partial transposition of @xmath with respect to @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

is always positive definite @xmath [ 84 ] . Consequently, the condition
@xmath is sufficient to assert that the state is entangled.
Mathematically, this is equivalent to saying that the state is entangled
if the partial transpose of the density matrix has at least one negative
eigenvalue. This property can be used to construct a quantitative
measure of the degree of entanglement for mixed states: For a generic
@xmath , the negativity of a subsystem @xmath is defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the term @xmath is the trace norm of the partial transpose of
@xmath . The negativity is therefore equal to the absolute value of the
sum of all the negative eigenvalues of the partial transpose (whose sum
can be different to 1) and it is zero if @xmath and its complement are
not entangled.

A second entanglement monotone is the logarithmic negativity [ 83 ] ,
simply given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

This quantity proved to be very useful since it is an upper bound to the
entanglement entropy for all pure states

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

and it can be computed in a simpler way, since it requires the full
spectrum of the density matrix instead of the reduced one that is
usually more difficult to extract.

#### 2.3.3 Beyond bipartite entanglement

Entanglement is not only a property of bipartite systems, but it reveals
itself also in the more complicated setup of multi-partite systems.
Nowadays, despite a very large literature on this topic [ 62 ] , we
still do not have a meaningful quantification and characterization of
multi-partite entanglement [ 85 ] .

In between classical correlations and entanglement, lies another measure
of correlations, the quantum discord . For the bipartite state @xmath ,
discord is defined as the difference between quantum mutual information
and classical correlations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the maximization of the classical correlations measure
over all possible POVM measurements @xmath , explicitly

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.62)
  -- -------- -- --------

and @xmath is the difference between von Neumann entropy and conditional
entropy. Originally, discord was introduced in [ 86 , 87 ] as an attempt
to discriminate between the purely classical correlations and the
quantum ones. Since its introduction, the nature of discord has been
widely investigated and many physical interpretations have been given,
especially in terms of computational advantages for states with positive
discord but zero entaglement [ 88 ] ⁴ ⁴ 4 Just before posting this
Thesis on the arXiv, a new work by Gheorghiu and Sanders [ 89 ] suggests
that non-zero discord is a quantifier for noisy measurements rather than
the flagpole of the quantum-classical border. .

Although we will not use these concepts in this Thesis, it is important
to be aware that quantifying correlations in quantum information theory
is still a controversial and open topic. A nice introduction to the
argument of multi-partite entanglement and additional references can be
found in [ 90 ] , while we suggest to look at [ 91 ] for a complete
review about quantum discord and related measures.

### 2.4 Stabilizer formalism

As we have seen, operations in quantum mechanics can be rather difficult
to understand, especially from a physical point of view. For this
reason, when dealing with graph states [ 85 ] and lattice quantum
many-body systems, particular classes of systems that can be described
in terms of the geometrical properties of the underlying pattern of the
interactions, we will make use of a method known as stabilizer formalism
[ 63 ] . This allows to describe quantum states in terms of the action
of certain special operators, called stabilizers . For a generic state
@xmath , we call stabilizer any operator @xmath such that [ 31 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.63)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then the stabilizer set @xmath of a quantum state @xmath composed of
@xmath subsystems, is defined as the set of stabilizer operators that
have @xmath as eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath . The stabilized state
@xmath is uniquely determined if the stabilizer set @xmath is generated
by exactly @xmath independent stabilizer generators. If @xmath is
generated by @xmath elements, then it does not stabilize a single state
but rather a @xmath dimensional subspace of the global Hilbert space of
the system for qubits and @xmath for qudits of dimension @xmath . When
we discuss the toric code [ 38 ] in 5.2.1 , it will be shown that the
Hamiltonian ground state is not unique but four-degenerate because the
toroidal structure of the system lattice causes two stabilizers to be
linearly dependent by the others, see 5.2.1 .

The stabilizer formalism is a powerful tool to describe topologically
ordered systems such as quantum double models [ 39 ] . The ground state
of each of these models is in a topological phase and the defining
Hamiltonian is constructed as a linear combination of the elements
composing the ground state subspace stabilizer set, as explained in
Chapter 5 . Most importantly, the stabilizer formalism allows for a
simpler description of the evolution of the state. Given the stabilizer
condition from Eq.( 2.63 ), under a unitary transformation of the state,
@xmath , @xmath transforms as @xmath in order to preserve its stabilizer
status @xmath . Note that the transformation @xmath under the action of
@xmath is opposite from the Heisenberg evolution of the observables
under the same unitary @xmath . In fact, when we evolve stabilizers we
are not modeling the evolution of observables, but rather evolving the
old stabilizers into new stabilizers for the new state. Hence, the
unitary evolution applied to the stabilizer must counteract that applied
to the state in order to maintain the stabilizer’s role as such [ 5 ] .

In the context of continuous-variable systems, there exists an
equivalent way to express the stabilizer relations by using nullifiers [
68 , 92 ] . In analogy with Eq.( 2.63 ), an operator @xmath is called a
nullifier for a state @xmath when the relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

holds. When the generators of the stabilizer set are elements of a Lie
group [ 67 ] , then the elements of the Lie algebra that generates the
Lie group compose the nullifier set of the state. Note that nullifiers
transform under the same transformation rule of the stabilizers.

### 2.5 Relativistic quantum information

Quantum mechanics deals with physics at small length scales. A
fascinating new area in physics is the study of relativistic and
gravitational effects on quantum information at scales usually
associated to the relativistic regime and, to a lesser degree, the use
of quantum information theory in relativistic physics. This is called
relativistic quantum information [ 34 , 35 ] and deals with the
interaction between gravity and the quantum phenomena, analyzing the
evolution of quantum systems over very large distances.

Previously we introduced the concept of qubit. But so far a qubit has
only been a mathematical concept, without any physical realization. In
practice, a qubit can be encoded by well-chosen degrees of freedom of
some physical system. For example photons , massless particles of light,
are a popular implementation of qubits [ 93 ] . In fact, while it is
possible to encode a 2-level quantum state into their spin degrees of
freedom, they also serve well as information carriers at relativistic
lengths, enabling for gedanken (and in the near future real) experiments
in open space [ 2 ] .

However, these degrees of freedom are not isolated, and they are
generally transformed under the effect of gravity during the evolution
of the information carriers. Understanding the gravitational effects on
photons [ 1 ] is therefore essential. From a theoretical point of view,
it helps to increase our comprehension of the physics of quantum
phenomena at relativistic scales, which is particularly important with a
theory of quantum gravity in mind, and practically it is a key step
toward the implementation of quantum communication protocols between the
Earth and satellites [ 2 , 94 , 95 ] .

#### 2.5.1 Physics of photons in special relativity

In this subsection we aim to give an intuition of the meaning of
polarization rotation for a photon, looking at the problem in the
setting of special relativity. In the following Chapter we will analyze
the effects induced by general relativity, motivating how one can
construct paths along which the phase introduced is independent of the
choice of reference frame.

In a Minkowski space-time, the generic state of a spin-particle is given
by some irreducible representation of the Poincaré group [ 96 , 67 ] and
can be represented by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.65)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the momentum four-vector, @xmath is the Lorentz
invariant measure and @xmath symbolizes the total spin degrees of
freedom. The basis states are complete and labeled by the four-momentum
and the spin along a particular direction. Experimentally, a generic
single photon state would correspond to a wave packet of the form in
Eq.( 2.65 ). In the following, the single photon state of interest
@xmath is described by a well-defined three-momentum @xmath , since
@xmath , and the helicity eigenvalues @xmath . Hence, a sharp-momentum
state can be written as [ 34 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

One can therefore think of the states @xmath as the computational basis
of a qubit. Alternatively, it is possible to use a pair of three-vectors
to label the same state, the momentum vector @xmath and the polarization
vector @xmath , where @xmath and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

The descriptions of a quantum state looked by observers associated to
two different reference frames connected by a Lorentz transformation
@xmath , are related by a quantum Lorentz transformation . This is a
unitary representation of the Poincaré group [ 96 , 67 ] @xmath that
describes the transformation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.68)
  -- -------- -- --------

States of definite helicity are invariant under Lorentz transformations,
while momentum states are generally affected. This motivates the choice
of working with sharp-momentum states: Since the basis states in Eq.(
2.67 ) are direct products of momentum and polarization, the spin states
do not entangle with momentum states, although they still acquire a
phase. Note that wave packets introduce an additional hurdle. The
entangling of the momentum and spin degrees of freedom forbids complete
distinguishability of states with different polarizations. As explained
in [ 34 ] , a Lorentz transformation acts on the generic spin @xmath
single-particle state with sharp momentum as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.69)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the matrix element of the representation of the Wigner
little group element @xmath , related to the spin @xmath representation
of the Lorentz group. In this sense a Lorentz transformation acts as a
quantum gate on the particle state. The classical information stored in
@xmath controls how @xmath transforms, and both control how the spin
state @xmath changes.

In order to keep things simple, we are not interested in presenting all
the mathematical details of the transformation rules for a massless
particle and thus, with much hand-waiving, we outline the idea and show
the final result straight-away. For a photon with well-defined momentum
@xmath , the effects of any Lorentz transformation are equivalent to the
effects of a single rotation around the @xmath -axis by an angle @xmath
[ 97 ] ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.70)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the reference frame is defined by the standard vector, which is a
unit light-like vector pointing in the @xmath -direction, mathematically
@xmath ⁵ ⁵ 5 The standard vector is transformed into the particle
momentum by a Lorentz transformation, @xmath , where @xmath , @xmath
rotations and @xmath boosts [ 98 ] . . For any @xmath rotation, the
matrix elements are given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.71)
  -- -------- -- --------

and consequently, the photon state transforms as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.72)
  -- -------- -- --------

The physical significance of this last equation is that a Lorentz
transformation introduces a relative phase for a photon state written in
the helicity basis,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.73)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the angle @xmath is exactly that phase. If one chooses a reference
frame to measure the polarization of the photon at the source, then the
phase introduced after the Lorentz transformation can be considered as a
consequence of the rotation of the polarization frame along the
trajectory.

In a flat space-time, if the sender knows the direction of propagation
of the photon it is always possible to setup a standard reference frame
as the triad of 3-vectors

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.74)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and the two polarization vectors are respectively @xmath
and @xmath . Then, in principle, one could invert the gate described by
Eq.( 2.72 ) to align the receiving detector in accordance with the
detector of the sender and measure the correct polarization. We will see
in the following Chapter that in general relativity there is no similar
procedure to follow and it is therefore necessary to find other ways to
extract the information encoded within [ 1 ] .

### 2.6 Loop quantum gravity

The two theories we have been discussing in this introduction are the
pillars of modern physics: The quantum theory, ranging from quantum
mechanics [ 59 ] to quantum field theories [ 99 ] , and Einstein’s
theory of relativity [ 100 ] . In general, the gauge theories that
describe the fundamental interactions of Nature can be quantized in a
canonical way [ 96 ] , i.e. starting from a classical theory and somehow
promoting the classical variables to quantum field operators. More
deeply, gauge theories are based on the concept of symmetry . All forces
among particles in Nature are identified by a structural group, which
determines the gauge invariance of the theory, in the sense that a
solution of the theory equations is still a solution under the action of
the gauge group [ 101 ] .

Although this approach works intimately well for particle interactions,
something more devious happens when attempting to canonically quantize
general relativity [ 54 , 101 ] , mainly for two reasons [ 65 ] : First,
a theory of quantum gravity seems to require a non-perturbative, or
background independent, quantization, since the metric of the manifold
becomes itself a dynamical variable that interacts with the presence of
mass. Second, it is not a trivial task to identify the gauge group of
general relativity, which is usually believed to be the group of
space-time diffeomorphisms. Under these assumptions, it becomes rather
hard to choose the proper physical observables of the theory [ 64 , 55 ]
.

Loop quantum gravity (LQG) is a non-perturbative canonical quantization
of gravity, where Einstein’s equations are described in terms of a SU(2)
Yang-Mills gauge theory [ 54 ] . The most remarkable (and maybe not
completely unexpected) result from LQG is that the geometry at the
quantum level is discrete [ 102 ] . In the theory, one defines area and
volume operators that have discrete spectra and minimal values. The
orthonormal basis states related to the diagonalization of these
observables are graphs called spin networks. The vertices of a spin
network are labelled by representations of the SU(2) group, and the
graph is set on a metric-independent manifold. The dynamics of the
theory is specified by a sequence of (allowed) moves that transform the
graph from an initial to a final quantum geometrical state. The
superposition of all the possible histories determine the quantum state
of a space-time [ 55 ] .

With these ideas in mind, the authors in [ 50 ] introduced polymer
quantization. Polymer quantization is a toy model proposed to study how
semiclassical states can arise from the full theory of quantum gravity,
and relies on assumptions similar to the construction of LQG. In
practice, it is a representation of the Weyl algebra unitarily
inequivalent to the Schrödinger’s one, which succeeded in describing the
kinematics and dynamics of a one-dimensional quantum system on a
discretized version of the real line. In Chapter 7 we will study quantum
entropy in the context of polymer quantization, investigating whether
the entropic predictions of different quantizations are in accordance.

### 2.7 Discussion

The short introduction to Loop Quantum Gravity concludes this
introductory Chapter. While no new physics has been introduced in these
pages, we covered most of the basic definitions that will be employed in
the following Chapters and give a taste of the various flavors of the
Thesis’ topics.

## Chapter 3 Photons – Phases and Experiments

In 2.5.1 we have analyzed the meaning of polarization rotation in
Minkowski space-time. In this Chapter we look at photons traveling in a
general gravitational field [ 100 , 103 ] . In particular, gravity
causes the polarization of photons to rotate and a meaningful evaluation
of the rotation can be achieved only by an appropriate definition of
reference frames [ 36 ] . The problem of comparison of reference frames
is not new, and it has been widely analyzed in the context of quantum
information [ 104 ] . The encoding of quantum information into the
degrees of freedom of a physical system always requires a choice of
frame where the encoding acquires informational meaning [ 105 ] . Then,
exchange of quantum information runs parallel to exchange of information
about reference frames between sender and receiver. Partial knowledge of
reference frames can lead to loss of communication capacity, and to
mistakes in identifying the information content of a physical system [ 1
] .

Precise understanding and estimation of the change in photon
polarization can be used for tests of relativity [ 106 ] , by sending
signals between earth and satellites in orbit. Furthermore, these
effects must be accurately evaluated when dealing with the
implementation of quantum protocols in space [ 107 , 108 , 109 ] , such
as quantum key distribution [ 30 ] . In principle, in a curved
space-time the sender needs to fix a reference frame at each point of
the trajectory, which is practically impossible, and exchange this
information with the receiver in order to measure the signal
appropriately. Therefore, all these implementations hide an expensive
price to pay: Finding a realistic way to share a reference frame between
the source of the signal and the receiver.

An answer to this problem was given in [ 36 ] , where the authors
introduced a natural gauge convention that fixes a set of rules to
define reference frames without the need of communication between the
parties. Here we present an alternative solution to the problem by
determining gauge-invariant trajectories of the photons along which the
polarization rotation can be precisely calculated irrespective of the
choice of reference frame [ 1 ] .

We begin this Chapter explaining concisely the mathematical treatment of
photons in general relativity, extending the meaning of polarization
rotation to curved backgrounds. We then show how one can look at this
problem from a geometrical point of view and demonstrate gauge-invariant
aspects of gravity-induced polarization rotation along closed
trajectories both in three-dimensional static projections of the
four-dimensional space-time and in the entire four-dimensional manifold.
To conclude the analysis we review a number of experimental proposals
aimed at testing general relativity at new scales, which are prominently
based on some of the concepts derived in this Chapter.

In the discussion we will make use of abundant terminology and elements
taken from differential geometry. While we use [ 101 ] and [ 110 ] as
primary sources, Appendix A provides a short introduction to the
relevant concepts. In the following we adopt the @xmath signature
convention for the metric ( A.3 ).

### 3.1 General relativitistic effects on photon states

Our kinematic description of photons in a gravitational field relies on
the short wave, or geometric optics limit, assumption [ 111 ] . We
assume that the wavelength of the particle is much smaller than the
minimum value between the typical curvature radius and some distance
taken large enough to ensure that the values of the amplitude,
polarization and wavelength vary significantly in its range ¹ ¹ 1
Analogously, the wave period must be much shorter than the time scales
involved in the process. . This allows to adopt the first post-eikonal
approximation [ 100 ] : Such approximation is an expansion of the
source-free Maxwell equations in empty space, based on the geometric
optics limit and on the implicit assumption that the electromagnetic
field is weak enough not to experience self gravitational interaction [
112 ] . Then, the more complicated laws of wave propagation in the
space-time reduce to the amplitude of the wave being transported along
the photons world lines [ 113 ] . At the first-order expansion, photons
are approximated to point particles that follow null trajectories with a
tangent 4-momentum,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

and carry a transversal, @xmath , space-like polarization vector,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

The momentum and polarization vectors are parallel transported along the
trajectory,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where a generic @xmath corresponds to the covariant derivative of @xmath
in the direction of @xmath as explained in A.33 . An interesting future
line of research consists of analyzing the gravitational effects on the
light polarization if one where to proceed using the full classical
Maxwell equations instead (for an example of such a description in a
uniform gravitational field, see [ 114 ] ).

A space-time manifold can always be covered by patches that locally look
like a Minkowski space-time [ 101 ] . Hence, at any point of the
space-time, one can define an orthonormal tetrad

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the observer is at rest. Then the local components of the momentum
and polarization vectors @xmath are defined in this tetrad.

In the following discussion we consider stationary gravitational fields.
A gravitational field is stationary , or constant , if it is possible to
choose a reference frame where all the components of the metric tensor
are independent of the time coordinate @xmath [ 115 ] . In other words:
On a stationary space-time, after a choice of reference frame (or, more
poetically, after a choice of time ) one can select three-dimensional
space-like surfaces @xmath all equipped with the same metric.
Practically, it is possible from a tetrad, using the @xmath
Landau-Lifshitz formalism, to construct a triad foliating the space-time
into space-like surfaces. This three-dimensional projection of the
space-time is defined by the map

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the four-dimensional space-time manifold and @xmath is a
three-dimensional spatial space. Consequently, any four-vector is
transformed into the three-vector corresponding to our choice of
foliation by a push-forward map @xmath (see [ 101 , 116 ] for details).
This is equivalent to dropping the time-like coordinate of the
four-vector. In the following we refer to this as the projection of a
vector on the static surface @xmath .

Hence, the local (static) description of a photon state can be provided
by the standard reference frame

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

as explained in 2.5.1 . The polarization vectors @xmath specify a linear
polarization basis and are dependent upon the momentum vector @xmath .
One can rewrite the parallel transport equations in this local
representation of the space-time mapping the four-dimensional covariant
derivative to the correspondent three-dimensional expression. Then

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the derivation of these formulas is provided in [ 112 , 116 , 117
] . The parameter @xmath is called affine parameter and determines the
trajectory while the symbol identifies the three-dimensional covariant
derivative.

The polarization and momentum vector from Eq.( 3.7 ) undergo an
evolution known as gravitational Faraday rotation [ 118 , 119 , 120 ] ,
which causes the momentum-polarization triad to rotate with angular
velocity @xmath given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

This is analog to the electromagnetic Faraday effect, which explains how
a polarized electromagnetic wave that travels through plasma rotates
under the action of a magnetic field [ 121 ] . In contrast with the
classical Faraday effect, in this case the rotation is purely a
geometric effect where @xmath is the gravitoelectric field term, and
@xmath plays the role of the gravitomagnetic field term. The names
follow from the quasi-Maxwell form of the Einstein equation for a
stationary space-time, derived from the @xmath Landau-Lifshitz formalism
[ 116 ] . Both terms are related to the elements of the projected
three-dimensional metric shown in A.3 as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

where g is a three-dimensional vector with components @xmath .

### 3.2 Geometric phase

In this section we look at the problem of polarization rotation from a
geometric perspective. Starting from the parallel transport equations,
we initially derive an alternative equation for the polarization
rotation for an arbitrary choice of the polarization basis. We then
project it to a static space-time and show that the phase accrued by the
photon state in the sense of Eq.( 2.73 ) depends on a Machian term and
on a reference frame term. The main result of this section is that the
phase, along a closed trajectory on @xmath , is invariant under the
choice of a different reference frame. Moreover, we extend the
discussion to general four-dimensional space-times and demonstrate that
for closed paths constructed ad hoc the same argument still holds.

##### An equation for the polarization rotation

We begin by defining at each point of the trajectory a local orthonormal
tetrad (or vierbein ) @xmath such that the momentum vector is locally
given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

The temporal gauge @xmath simplifies things quite a lot, and allows us
to set

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the local polarization basis @xmath is chosen according to some
procedure. Hence, the general form of the real linear polarization
four-vector at some point of the trajectory is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the phase @xmath explictly appears in the formulation. We set the
initial phase @xmath and thus

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

at the starting point of a trajectory. Using the parallel transport
equations from Eq.( 3.3 ), we can derive a differential equation for the
polarization rotation. Since along the trajectory we generically have
that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

one can calculate the following covariant derivative

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using differential geometry rules this transforms as

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (3.16)
              @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

The final equation is therefore given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

##### A static equation for the polarization rotation

One can project the polarization equation derived above to the
space-like surface @xmath by constructing the relevant vectors using the
push-forward map extracted from Eq.( 3.5 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

Consequently, in three spatial dimensions we have the following
equation:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (3.20)
                          
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

The two terms that compose the phase evolution equation are the Machian
effect term @xmath , and the reference-frame contribution, respectively.
The first quantity corresponds to the original Machian effect that was
postulated in [ 122 ] and specifies how the ‘gravitational dragging’
caused by a rotating mass affects the polarization. The second term is
due to the variation of the polarization basis along the trajectory.

The geometric meaning hidden behind this equation is rather interesting.
First introduce a basis of 1-forms @xmath , dual to the orthonormal
polarization basis (or triad) @xmath at every point of the trajectory,
such that @xmath . One can write a matrix of connection 1-forms @xmath
using the 1-form basis and with the help of the Ricci rotation
coefficients @xmath as [ 100 , 110 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

For sake of clarity, remember that the polarization vector can be
rewritten as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

We can then calculate the covariant derivative of @xmath ; we will
explicitly show how to do it component-wise. The general formula for the
covariant derivative of a vector field @xmath in @xmath -dimensions
along a direction @xmath is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

For @xmath and keeping in mind that in this case

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

one easily finds that

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (3.25)
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Applying the same argument for the second component, we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

On the other hand, the third and last component is simply equal to

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (3.27)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Taking into account that for any orthonormal frame such as ours, the
matrix of the connections is antisymmetric [ 110 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

we can use the antisymmetry of the Ricci coefficients, i.e. @xmath , to
rewrite the covariant derivative of @xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (3.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

What is the physical meaning of the @xmath , @xmath coefficients? From
Eq.( 3.28 ) it follows straightforwardly that @xmath and therefore also

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

Finally, since @xmath , Eq.( 3.2 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now we compare this last equation with the three-dimensional stationary
propagation equation ( 3.7 ) for the polarization vector [ 112 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

From this equation one finds that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

so the immediate goal now is simply to extract @xmath from Eq.( 3.8 ),
which is rather easy

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using this last expression in Eq.( 3.31 ) we have that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

and an alternative equation for the polarization rotation follows
straightforwardly [ 1 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

This equation shows manifestly the dependence of @xmath , intended as
the phase variation along the trajectory, on the geometrical properties
of the space manifold. For completeness, these considerations also lead
to the equalities:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 3.2.1 Gauge invariance of the phase @xmath

Having now a convenient way to describe the polarization rotation in a
time-independent three-dimensional surface, we can show that any choice
of polarization basis along a closed (spatial) trajectory does not
affect the value of @xmath . On a three-dimensional oriented Riemannian
manifold, given a trajectory with a tangent vector @xmath , one can
always assign at each point a two-dimensional tangent vector space with
local basis @xmath [ 110 ] . Since each two-dimensional real vector
@xmath belongs to the space @xmath , which is homeomorphic to @xmath ,
it is clear that the transition function between two charts is given by
the complex number

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

that determines a rotation of the basis vectors. In terms of
differential geometry this is equivalent to saying that we can define
along the trajectory a complex line bundle normal to the direction of
movement. This is a special case of vector bundle ( A.4 ), the
connection of which is a single 1-form, in this instance equal to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

defined similarly to the usual treatment of geometric phase [ 110 , 123
] . The structure group for this line bundle is thus SO(2). Physically,
this last statement means that the freedom of choosing the polarization
frame @xmath at every point of the trajectory is represented by a SO(2)
rotation @xmath [ 110 ] .

Under the change of basis @xmath , the connection transforms as [ 110 ,
101 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

and for its only component this corresponds to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore, the gauge transformation modifies Eq.( 3.36 ) into

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since we are now dealing with a purely spatial surface, it does no harm
to consider a closed trajectory [ 115 ] . For a closed trajectory the
resulting phase is gauge-invariant, in the sense that @xmath does not
depend upon the choice of the frame at any point on the trajectory, as
long as one employes the same reference frame to measure polarization at
the beginning and at the end of the closed curve. To prove this
assertion, it is enough to notice that the last term of Eq.( 3.42 ) is a
total differential and drops out upon the integration on a closed
contour @xmath , i.e. @xmath and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

Thus, the polarization phase is a topological invariant with respect to
the reference frame, arising, as often happens in physics, by
integrating a local geometric quantity.

We can formalize this with the help of the bundle 2-form curvature. In
general, given a connection @xmath the matrix of curvatures is defined
as @xmath (see A.39 ), and component-wise this can be rewritten as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the particular case of local orthonormal frames for a two-dimensional
Riemannian manifold, since only the off-diagonal terms survive in the
matrix of local connections, i.e. @xmath [ 110 ] , the curvature matrix
is exactly given by @xmath and for the SO(2) bundle it reduces to the
single 2-form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

By using Stokes’ theorem, which states that the surface integral of the
differential of a @xmath -form is equal to the integral of the same
@xmath -form along the boundary of the surface [ 101 ] , the
reference-frame term in Eq.( 3.43 ) can be rewritten as a surface
integral of the bundle curvature as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

from which follows:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

If we are working in any stationary space where the gravitational body
is not rotating and @xmath , the phase will only be a function of the
geometrical properties of the manifold embedded inside the closed
trajectory of the photon.

For a Schwarzschild space-time there exists an explicit choice of local
reference frames, the Newton Gauge [ 36 ] , where the standard
polarization basis vectors are chosen to prevent the necessity of
references to parallel transport or communication between the observers.
The Newton gauge is designed to give a zero phase along any trajectory
in the Schwarzschild space-time. As a result of the independence of the
choice of reference frame, or gauge invariance, of Eq.( 3.47 ), a photon
traveling on a closed path in a stationary projection of the
Schwarzschild space-time does not accrue a gravitationally-induced
phase, regardless of the gauge convention.

##### General four-dimensional space-time

This argument can be taken a step further and generalized to a
four-dimensional space-time. From Eq.( 3.12 ) we already know that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

and we can calculate the covariant derivative @xmath easily, starting
with @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

The calculations for the other indices are maybe boring, but can be
comfortably done without too much effort:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (3.50)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.51)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.52)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Thus the covariant derivative of @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (3.53)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

where we have used again the antisymmetry ( 3.28 ) for the elements of
the matrix of connection 1-forms. From the parallel transport condition
@xmath , we can see that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

where now @xmath plays the role of a bundle connection.

As long as time-travel remains part of the science-fiction realm, we
cannot have a closed trajectory in space-time. Nevertheless, to obtain a
gauge-invariant result one can consider two future-directed trajectories
that begin and end in the same two space-time points. The careful reader
will easily notice that this layout is similar to the two arms of a
Mach-Zender interferometer [ 111 , 93 ] . To avoid phase variations
induced by other factors, the observers align the initial and final
propagation directions of the beams and agree on common rules to define
the standard polarization basis. In analogy with the previous case, the
bundle curvature is the differential of the connection

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

Integrating Eq.( 3.55 ) for two open curves @xmath and @xmath such that
@xmath is closed, and using again the Stokes’ theorem, one finds that
the phase is equal to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

Note that in this case it is not necessary to consider a stationary
space-time (which is necessary instead for our definition of the @xmath
projection) and the result above holds for any general space-time [ 1 ]
.

### 3.3 Discussion and experimental applications

In this Chapter we showed that the reference frame term in Eq.( 3.2 ) is
responsible for a gauge-independent geometric phase, or polarization
rotation, accrued by the photon state on a closed trajectory.

Proper understanding of polarization behavior and polarization rotation
measurements is a necessary step when quantum technology is meant to be
used for precisions tests of relativity, for quantum information
protocols in the presence of gravity and, more at the fundamental level,
to design feasible tests for a theory of quantum gravity. A wide variety
of potential tests of fundamental physics that can be conducted with
satellites in Earth orbit and quantum communication protocols are
reviewed in [ 2 ] . The main reason to have experiments performed with
the help of satellites is because they allow to reach length-scales and
velocities that are practically unreachable on the ground.

Tasks directly related to the contents of this Chapter include detection
of the special and general relativistic effects on the polarization of
single photons exchanged between Earth surface and an artificial
satellite moving in low earth orbit (LEO), an elliptical orbit about the
Earth with altitude up to @xmath Km. In a number of realistic scenarios,
the frame-dragging effects are dominant over the Machian effects, see [
36 ] for the analysis. The expected optical effects are very small. Two
examples presented in [ 2 ] illustrate the order of magnitude.
Considering the gravitational field produced by the Earth and taking a
photon emitted from the LAGEOS satellite orbit ( @xmath Km) [ 124 ] and
detected at infinity, one obtains a rotation of @xmath arc msec in a
single run. In the scattering scenario of a photon emitted along the
axis of rotation of the Earth, the resulting phase is minuscule, @xmath
arc msec. These results are not gauge-invariant in the sense illustrated
previously, in fact to model a closed path one needs at least three
nodes. The tiny measurable effects set these experiments beyond reach
with the current technology.

We conclude this section describing a proposal for a satellite-based
quantum optics experiment conceivable with today’s technology, and
offering a short overview about more exotic experiments that go beyond
the detection of purely relativistic effects.

##### The optical COW experiment

Realistic results in a near-term timeframe are expected to be provided
by a satellite-based proposal of the famous Colella, Overhauser, and
Werner (COW) experiment. The COW experiment [ 125 ] is a
well-established experiment used to verify the classical equivalence
principle in the quantum limit through observation of the phase shift in
a neutron beam interferometer induced by a gravitational potential.
While the standard experiment is conducted using neutron beams and a
rotating interferometer, an equivalent optical setup can be designed
making use of optical fibers and a satellite in low earth orbit. This is
particularly appealing since a satisfying correspondence between theory
and experiment [ 126 ] has not been achieved yet: Hence, a test
conducted at larger length-scale could shade some light on this
discrepancy.

To perform the test, at the Earth’s surface an optical beam of
wavelength @xmath is split by a semitransparent mirror: While one path
is delayed on the ground by an optical fibre of length @xmath Km, the
second path is transmitted to the satellite and then coherently
recombined at the end to construct an interferometer. The difference in
Newtonian gravitational potential between the two paths causes a
different phase shift in the two fibers. Using this optical setup one
can analyze gravitational redshift effects in the context of quantum
optics. In a weak gravitational field, the phase difference for a
wavelength @xmath nm is approximately equal to [ 2 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the free fall acceleration on Earth’s surface, @xmath Km
is the satellite altitude, and @xmath is the speed of light. It is
interesting to point out that the large speed of the satellite may
introduce rotational effects since the interferometer path covers an
area, caused by the orbital movement of the satellite. Moreover, because
of the large distances involved the Earth’s gravitational field is not
constant and the apparatus would detect a general-relativistic
phase-shift, with quantum interference caused by the curvature of the
space-time.

##### Beyond tests of relativistic effects

The first and most direct extension to the tests of relativistic effects
on discrete quantum systems is probing the physics of quantum field
theory in accelerating frames, such as testing the Unruh effect [ 127 ]
. Other possible experiments achievable making use of satellites include
more exotic topics. For instance, one can consider tests of entanglement
at relativistic scales, such as long distance Bell tests [ 128 , 129 ]
and Bell tests with detectors in relative motion. A more practical
application is the implementation of quantum cryptography protocols in
space [ 108 , 107 , 109 ] , which could allow to implement secure
quantum communication on a global scale. Finally, a fascinating
direction to undertake is the analysis of possible manifestations of
quantum gravity effects at the Planck scale and how to detect these
effects [ 2 ] .

## Chapter 4 Gaussian States

The basic primitive of quantum computation is the qubit [ 31 ] . Qubits
and their @xmath -dimensional generalizations, the qudits, are the
abstraction of discrete physical systems, and their quantum states are
defined in finite dimensional Hilbert spaces. However, not every
physical system can be described by such states, and especially in the
field of quantum optics [ 130 , 93 , 111 ] , a generalization to
infinitely-dimensional Hilbert spaces is required. With this in mind,
here we introduce and analyze continuous-variable (or CV) systems [ 131
] , which are often important for quantum computation and information
protocols on either practical or theoretical grounds [ 132 ] . In
particular, we will focus on Gaussian states [ 3 , 37 , 45 ] , a subset
of the CV states that allow for a very simple and precise mathematical
characterization. Furthermore, Gaussian states are widely used today for
experimental purposes in quantum optics and quantum information [ 45 ,
47 , 46 , 5 ] . They also serve as main ingredients for the CV
generalizations of the most famous quantum protocols, for instance
Gaussian quantum teleportation [ 133 , 131 , 134 ] and Gaussian quantum
key distribution [ 135 , 136 ] . Last but not least, there exist several
proposals to realize quantum computation by means of Gaussian states: At
first, in [ 137 ] it was analyzed how to perform Gaussian quantum
computation in the circuit-model setup. This was followed by a second
approach, based on encoding qubits into quantum harmonic oscillators in
order to simplify error correction and increase the structural fault
tolerance [ 138 ] . A third different scheme is the CV cluster-state
quantum computation [ 46 ] , where the information is processed via
local measurements on the modes of a Gaussian lattice of entangled
oscillators.

In this Chapter we start presenting the usual phase-space notation for
Gaussian states, showing the equivalence between the density matrix and
the Wigner functions description. Then we introduce the basic concepts
of covariance matrix, symplectic transformations, Williamson’s form and
symplectic eigenvalues. After that, we demonstrate how to quantify
bipartite entanglement for pure Gaussian states making use of the
symplectic spectrum and give an explicit example for two coupled
oscillators. To conclude, we introduce the graphical calculus for
Gaussian states [ 92 ] , a powerful method to represent pure Gaussian
states in terms of their graph properties.

This short review serves as a necessary introduction to the following
sections of the Thesis. In Chapter 6 , we use Gaussian states to
construct the CV analog to the Kitaev surface code [ 38 ] , a
2-dimensional lattice of highly-entangled harmonic oscillators that
exhibits topological order [ 39 , 40 ] , through simple Gaussian
operations that are experimentally feasible today in the laboratory. But
Gaussian states prove to be useful also in the context of polymer
quantization [ 50 ] , Chapter 7 . Their simple mathematical formalism is
the perfect playground to demonstrate the convergence properties of
entropy for two coupled quantum harmonic oscillators quantized in
unitarily inequivalent representations of the Weyl-Heisenberg algebra [
4 ] . This Chapter, being a short review of a well established topic,
follows the structure of [ 3 ] .

### 4.1 Bosonic systems and Gaussian states representations

In general, a continuous-variable state is described in terms of
observables with continuous spectra associated with an infinitely
dimensional Hilbert space [ 132 ] . The most typical example is a set of
@xmath quantum harmonic oscillators, or bosonic modes. Physically, this
is equivalent to the noninteracting quantized electromagnetic field in a
cavity, where each @xmath -th bosonic mode, or harmonic, is associated
to a Hilbert space @xmath , and the global space is @xmath . In natural
units where @xmath , and adopting the convention @xmath , we assign to
each mode a pair of field operators @xmath that fulfill the bosonic
commutation relation @xmath and define the single-mode Hamiltonian
@xmath [ 45 ] .

The set of commutation relations of all the @xmath bosonic operator
pairs can be rewritten by collecting the bosonic operators into the
vector @xmath of length @xmath , and defining the symplectic form @xmath
[ 44 ] , whose entries are given by the commutators of the elements of
@xmath

  -- -- -- -------
           (4.1)
  -- -- -- -------

with @xmath and @xmath the @xmath identity matrix. Note that @xmath is a
skew-symmetric matrix with @xmath . The Hilbert space @xmath of the
@xmath -th oscillator is spanned by an infinitely-dimensional Fock basis
@xmath , whose elements are the eigenstates of the number operator
@xmath , explicitly @xmath . The action of the bosonic operators on the
basis states is described by the relations @xmath , and @xmath . Each
single-mode annihilation operator @xmath nullifies the corresponding
ground state @xmath , i.e. @xmath [ 59 ] .

We can use an alternative set of field operators to describe a @xmath
modes CV state. These are the @xmath pairs of quadrature operators
@xmath , defined in terms of linear combinations of the annihilation and
creation operators:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

with canonical commutation relations

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

In analogy with what done before, one introduces a @xmath vector @xmath
such that the symplectic form @xmath can be equally defined as

  -- -- -- -------
           (4.4)
  -- -- -- -------

The operators @xmath and @xmath correspond to observable physical
quantities with continuous spectra. Their eigenstates are the
non-normalizable basis states @xmath and @xmath , where @xmath and
@xmath , related by a Fourier transform as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

and vice-versa.

To give a precise mathematical definition to these statements, one needs
to take into account the phase-space description of a CV system.
Introduce the Weyl operator or phase-space displacement operator [ 139 ]
:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

The vector @xmath defines the displacement, which can equally be
represented in complex form as @xmath . The action of the @xmath -th
displacement operator on the @xmath -th mode ground state results in the
coherent state @xmath , where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

The important point here is that any state @xmath of @xmath modes can be
characterized by its characteristic function [ 130 , 93 ] , defined as
the expectation value of the Weyl operator

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

In fact, @xmath is equivalent to the Wigner distribution [ 130 , 93 ] ,
which is a phase-space representation of the density matrix @xmath
defined in terms of the @xmath phase-space quadrature variables @xmath
and eigenvectors @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

The Wigner function is usually expressed by the Fourier transform of the
characteristic function,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath . The density operator of the quantum state can be written
in terms of its characteristic function by means of a Fourier-Weyl
relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the Weyl operator from Eq.( 4.6 ), and therefore the
state is uniquely determined by @xmath [ 3 ] . This leads to the
following important definition: A @xmath -mode state @xmath is Gaussian
whenever its characteristic function @xmath is a Gaussian shaped in
phase-space, which means that it can be written as [ 45 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

As a consequence of Eq.( 4.10 ) this is equivalent to saying that a
state is Gaussian when its Wigner distribution is a Gaussian function.

In general (see [ 140 , 59 ] for a proof), the ground state of any
system of N harmonic oscillators is a Gaussian state. In fact, the
ground state of any system described by a Hamiltonian linear or
quadratic in the canonical operators

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

defined by a real and positive-definite crossing matrix @xmath , is
Gaussian.

The first two statistical moments of a Gaussian state are captured by
the vector @xmath of expectation values of the quadrature operators and
the @xmath real symmetric matrix @xmath , which carries the information
about the variances

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

The matrix @xmath is called covariance matrix (or sometimes noise matrix
) and it plays a central role in the description of the entanglement
properties of a Gaussian state [ 141 , 142 , 143 ] . We can see from the
form of the characteristic function @xmath in Eq.( 4.12 ) that a
Gaussian state @xmath is entirely described by the set of its first two
statistical moments [ 144 ] , meaning that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

Consequently, all higher-order statistical moments of a Gaussian state
can be expressed from @xmath and @xmath . Local unitary transformations
do not change entanglement [ 145 ] and since displacements @xmath are
single-mode local translations in phase-space, they leave the
entanglement properties of the state unaffected. Therefore the elements
of @xmath do not contribute to the entanglement and they can all be made
zero. Accordingly, the covariance matrix can be rewritten as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

However, a real symmetric matrix @xmath cannot be arbitrary. The
canonical commutation relations require the positive definiteness of [
141 , 143 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

which really is just another way to rewrite the Heisenberg uncertainty
relations.

#### 4.1.1 Symplectic transformations

Gaussian states are of fundamental importance in quantum information
applications because of the existence of a class of mathematical
operators corresponding to common laboratory procedures that preserve
Gaussian properties [ 68 , 37 ] . Thus, we define a Gaussian unitary
operation any unitary transformation that maps a Gaussian state onto a
Gaussian state.

There exists a symplectic representation of the Gaussian unitary group [
141 ] . To each Gaussian transformation @xmath we can associate a unique
symplectic transformation @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the Lie group @xmath is called the real symplectic group ¹ ¹ 1 For
more details about this group and its properties, see [ 44 ] . . The
group element @xmath describes a linear transformation of the quadrature
operators expressed by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

In order to leave the kinematics invariant, these linear homogenous
transformations must preserve the canonical commutation relations from
Eq.( 4.3 ). Hence, in analogy with the classical Hamilton’s equations of
motion [ 37 ] , the action of any @xmath on the matrix @xmath is given
by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

Furthermore, if @xmath is a symplectic transformation then it also
satisfies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.21)
     @xmath      (4.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

and @xmath . Under the action of a symplectic transformation, the
evolution of the covariance matrix is governed by the transformation [
37 , 45 , 142 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

##### Symplectic eigenvalues

The eigenvalues of a matrix are invariant under a similarity
transformation such as @xmath [ 146 ] . However, Eq. 4.23 tells us that
the covariance matrix does not transform by a similarity transformation
under the action of the symplectic group. Hence, we want to find an
alternative form of @xmath such that its eigenvalues are invariant under
a symplectic transformation and can be used to uniquely characterize the
state.

To do so, we use Williamson’s theorem [ 147 ] . It states that any real
symmetric positive-definite @xmath matrix, for instance the covariance
matrix @xmath of a @xmath -mode Gaussian state @xmath , can always be
made diagonal by means of a suitable symplectic transformation @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

where now

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

and all the @xmath are real. After the transformation @xmath , one finds
for the transformed quadrature operators @xmath that @xmath . The matrix
@xmath is called the Williamson’s normal form of the matrix @xmath . It
is important to realize that in general the @xmath are not the
eigenvalues of @xmath or of any @xmath determined by a transformation
@xmath different from @xmath .

Define a new matrix @xmath such that @xmath and thus

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

From ( 4.20 ) it is easy to see that @xmath and therefore the action of
a symplectic transformation @xmath on the matrix @xmath results in a
similarity transformation of @xmath that preserves its eigenvalues,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

Hence, every matrix @xmath that is determined by varying @xmath over the
group @xmath shares the same spectrum [ 141 ] . In particular, if we
take the matrix @xmath to its Williamson form and transform @xmath
accordingly, the eigenvalues of the matrix

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

will be equal to @xmath [ 83 ] . The @xmath absolute values @xmath of
the elements of the spectrum correspond to the @xmath distinct
eigenvalues of @xmath . These are the symplectic eigenvalues of the
(covariance) matrix @xmath while the set @xmath is called the symplectic
spectrum . This spectrum characterizes the Gaussian state. By
construction it is invariant under any Gaussian transformation.

This description has immediate practical consequences. Once the
covariance matrix @xmath of some Gaussian state is given or calculated,
the set of symplectic eigenvalues can be directly obtained from the
spectrum of the matrix @xmath . In the following section we will show
how the symplectic eigenvalues contain the total information about the
entanglement properties of the state. This is the reason why this
algebraic description of Gaussian states is extremely efficient. It
allows to quantify entanglement simply from the symplectic eigenvalues
of the matrix of second moments of the state, which are in general much
easier to calculate than the eigenvalues of the full density matrix.

### 4.2 Entanglement entropy for Gaussian states

We have seen previously that for pure states, the entanglement entropy (
2.55 ) is the preferred way to quantify the entanglement between a
subsystem @xmath of some system @xmath , and its complement @xmath .
Unlike the general case, the von Neumann entropy of Gaussian states has
a simple expression in terms of a finite number of the symplectic
eigenvalues @xmath of the covariance matrix. Specifically [ 3 , 148 ] ,

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.29)
  -- -- -- --------

where the index @xmath runs over the modes of one of the two subsystems
under examination. Here we present an accessible and precise
step-by-step derivation of this formula, showing the link between
covariance matrix of a Gaussian state, symplectic eigenvalues and
entropy.

#### 4.2.1 Derivation of the formula

Start with a generic @xmath -modes Gaussian state @xmath with covariance
matrix @xmath and @xmath pairs of mass and frequency parameters @xmath .
Although rather unphysical, the choice of using equal frequencies for
the oscillators is motivated by simplicity, as it is often done in the
literature, see for example [ 149 ] . We still use natural units where
@xmath . Since @xmath is a real symmetric matrix, there always exists a
unitary symplectic transformation @xmath represented by a matrix @xmath
that acts on the state as @xmath and takes @xmath to the normal form
@xmath , which in general is not the Williamson form @xmath [ 146 , 143
] . As a consequence of the diagonalisation of the covariance matrix,
the transformed state @xmath is now described by the direct product of
@xmath density matrices

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

which correspond to uncoupled and non-local thermal quantum oscillators
[ 150 ] .

Following the transformation, each oscillator has new mass and frequency
@xmath and transformed creation and annihilation operators

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.31)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

From Eq.( 4.19 ) it is easy to see that under a symplectic
transformation @xmath , the bosonic operators transform according to the
quadrature operators transformation, an operation more conventionally
called a Bogolyubov transformation:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

Finally, the Hamiltonian of a single thermal oscillator is equal to
@xmath ² ² 2 In the following, since we will be always referring to the
transformed modes unless stated explicitly, we drop the primes to
lighten the notation. . A quantum harmonic oscillator in thermal
equilibrium with a bath at temperature @xmath is statistically described
by a canonical ensemble [ 59 ] . More explicitly, we can rewrite its
density matrix in the Fock basis @xmath as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the @xmath are the probabilities associated to each state @xmath ,
with @xmath energy of the @xmath -th state of the Hamiltonian @xmath and
@xmath partition function that normalizes the probabilities [ 151 ] .
Considering the decomposition from Eq.( 4.30 ), a single-mode partition
function is equivalent to

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.33)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

where we used @xmath and @xmath is a cumulative parameter that depends
on the transformed frequency @xmath . Using properties of the geometric
series, the last part of Eq.( 4.33 ) can be rewritten as

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (4.34)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

and then the density matrix of each uncoupled thermal mode is equal to

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (4.35)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

One can further simplify this expression rewriting the density matrix in
terms of @xmath , mean occupation number of the transformed modes:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (4.36)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

As a result we obtain the following alternative way to write the thermal
density matrix,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

Explicit calculation of the von Neumann entropy @xmath gives:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
                          
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (4.38)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

where we used the following summation properties [ 152 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is precisely the von Neumann entropy of a single oscillator thermal
state expressed in terms of the mean occupation number:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is a well-known result in statistical physics [ 151 ] .

It is now very simple to show the connection of the entropy with the
symplectic eigenvalue @xmath of the state. After the symplectic
transformation @xmath that takes the (total) covariance matrix @xmath to
its normal form, each reduced covariance matrix associated to a
single-mode non-local thermal state @xmath looks like

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.41)
  -- -- -- --------

Using the creation and annihilation operators ( 4.31 ), one easily finds
that the expectation values of the transformed quadratures are

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
                          
              @xmath      (4.42)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

From a simple algebraic argument, the eigenvalues pair @xmath of the
matrix multiplication @xmath are:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

The following equivalence shows the explicit connection between the
symplectic eigenvalue of a generic thermal Gaussian state and its mean
occupation number

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

We know from Eq.( 2.36 ) that entropy is an additive quantity, and the
total entropy of a state @xmath equal to the direct tensor product of
@xmath states, is simply the sum of the entropies of each state, i.e.
for @xmath we have @xmath . Using Eq.( 4.40 ), the von Neumann entropy
for the Gaussian state @xmath can therefore be written in terms of the
@xmath symplectic eigenvalues @xmath of the diagonalised @xmath as

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.45)
  -- -- -- --------

which corresponds to Eq.( 4.29 ). Recall that we are now considering the
transformed modes. Since the quantum entropy of a Gaussian state is
solely a function of the symplectic eigenvalues, which are invariant
under any symplectic transformation @xmath , entropy is invariant under
any @xmath itself.

It is interesting to note from Eq.( 4.36 ) and Eq.( 4.44 ) that the
thermal parameter @xmath of each non-local oscillator is related to the
correspondent symplectic eigenvalue as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 4.2.2 An example: Two coupled harmonic oscillators

As a simple example consider a system composed of two quantum harmonic
oscillators with equal mass @xmath and frequency @xmath coupled in
position, described by the following Hamiltonian:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath positive coupling parameter such that @xmath . We will use
this example again in Chapter 7 , so pay attention now! Since the
Hamiltonian is bilinear, the ground state of this system is still
Gaussian and we want to exploit this property to calculate the bipartite
ground state entanglement between the two oscillators. The global
symplectic transformation @xmath described by the matrix

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.48)
  -- -- -- --------

transforms the system into two uncoupled oscillator with new frequencies
equal to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

After diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, the corresponding normal modes
covariance matrix analog to ( 4.41 ) is

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.50)
  -- -- -- --------

Inverting Eq.( 4.23 ) one easily obtains the covariance matrix @xmath of
the system

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.51)
  -- -- -- --------

In this case, it is straightforward to trace out the complementary
degrees of freedom and derive the reduced covariance matrix for the
first (or, equivalently, the second) oscillator:

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.52)
  -- -- -- --------

The last step is to calculate the single symplectic eigenvalue that
belongs to the reduced covariance @xmath matrix from the spectrum of
@xmath , which is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now @xmath can be used to quantify the bipartite entanglement between
the coupled oscillators using the formula from Eq.( 4.29 ).

#### 4.2.3 Physical intuition

We conclude this part mentioning few thermodynamical considerations that
highlight a particularly interesting connection between entanglement and
thermal properties of the subsystems. It should be understood that
through an appropriate choice of a global symplectic transformation
@xmath , a Gaussian state @xmath (or @xmath ) of @xmath coupled
oscillators can be decomposed into the tensor product of @xmath single
thermal oscillators. If @xmath is pure, the new non-local oscillators
@xmath are also pure, following the decomposition properties of a pure
state. Hence, the decoupled oscillators are all in the ground state and
a virtual temperature @xmath can be assigned to each of them. From the
relation ( 4.44 ) it follows that all the symplectic eigenvalues are
equal to @xmath and therefore the formula in Eq.( 4.29 ) confirms the
well-known property that the total von Neumann entropy of a pure state
is zero.

Divide the @xmath modes into two sets @xmath and @xmath such that @xmath
and @xmath belongs to Alice, while @xmath belongs to Bob. In order to
calculate the entanglement entropy @xmath across the bipartition, one
needs to know the set of symplectic eigenvalues that belong to one of
the two partitions. If Alice wants to study her part of the system, she
first notices that, in general, after the division the reduced density
matrix @xmath corresponds to a mixed state. Therefore, locally
decomposing @xmath by means of a local Gaussian unitary @xmath
associated to the symplectic transformation @xmath gives a new state
@xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

which contains both thermal (at virtual temperature @xmath ) and ground
state oscillators.

Alice’s symplectic spectrum @xmath is obtained from the spectrum of
@xmath where @xmath is the reduced covariance matrix of the set @xmath .
Suppose Alice extracts @xmath symplectic eigenvalues satisfying

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

and @xmath eigenvalues @xmath . This means that Alice’s set can be
decomposed as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

Physically, this corresponds to having @xmath virtual thermal
oscillators with thermal parameter @xmath given by Eq.( 4.46 ) and
@xmath ground states. Only the thermal oscillators contribute to the
bipartite entanglement entropy . It is important to be precise at this
point and to avoid taking these conclusions too far. The density
operator for the virtual modes has the same form as a Gibbs ensemble,
however these oscillators are completely isolated and not in thermal
equilibrium with any reservoir.

The construction in Eq.( 4.56 ) was made rigorous in [ 150 , 153 ] ,
where the authors proved that, after identifying the two sets @xmath and
@xmath , it is always possible to write the Gaussian pure state @xmath
as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are transformed modes resulting from the
application of some local symplectic transformations on the set @xmath
and @xmath , and @xmath is equal to the number of symplectic eigenvalues
associated to Alice’s or Bob’s reduced covariance matrix. This means
that the state @xmath can always be rewritten as the direct product of
@xmath two-mode squeezed states, where each mode belongs to a different
partition of the system, and @xmath oscillator ground states @xmath
(respectively, @xmath in partition @xmath and @xmath in partition @xmath
).

Each two-mode squeezed state @xmath is described by a sum over the Fock
basis of the partitions

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath squeezing parameter correspondent to the thermal parameter
of the @xmath -th thermal oscillator of the local normal-modes
decomposition of @xmath (or @xmath ).

### 4.3 Graphical calculus for pure Gaussian states

We conclude this Chapter with a short introduction to the graphical
calculus for pure Gaussian states [ 92 ] , an elegant graphical
representation that allows to describe any Gaussian pure state (and the
most common Gaussian transformations) by its graph (and graph
transformations). This formalism will provide an important
simplification in the subsequent discussion of topologically ordered CV
systems [ 5 ] , Chapter 6 , when describing the connection between the
CV cluster-state [ 46 , 47 ] and the CV surface code state [ 5 ] , since
both are Gaussian states. Specifically, the measurement patterns that
connect the two types of states have definite graph transformation
rules, so the connection between the two graphs can be derived using the
graphical calculus directly. Before starting, we introduce the concept
of graph.

#### 4.3.1 Elements of graph theory

A graph [ 154 ] is a collection of vertices and connections between
vertices, called edges. It is defined by the pair @xmath , where @xmath
is the set of vertices, uniquely labelled by an integer and normally
pictured as a set of dots, and @xmath is the set of edges, represented
by lines joining pairs of vertices. The structure of the relations among
the vertices of a graph @xmath is described by its adjacency matrix
@xmath . This matrix has elements @xmath , if the edge @xmath and @xmath
otherwise. For a vertex @xmath , its neighborhood @xmath is given by all
the vertices @xmath such that @xmath . Physically, one usually
identifies the vertices with quantum systems and the edges with the
interaction between the systems.

A graph is directed if each edge is given a particular orientation, and
weighted if all the edges are associated with a number, in which case
the corresponding entries in the adjacency matrix are replaced by the
values of each weight. Loops are edges that start and end at the same
vertex. Undirected graphs without loops and at most one edge between any
pair of vertices are called simple graphs . The adjacency matrix of a
simple graph is thus symmetric with zero diagonal elements. In the
description of the graphical calculus we will in general make use of
undirected graphs with self-loops and complex entries, such that the
adjacency matrix is still symmetric but with non-zero elements on the
diagonal. Certain properties of a graph can be understood in terms of
vertex coloring, a map @xmath , where @xmath is the set of colors, and
@xmath for all adjacent vertices @xmath .

#### 4.3.2 The graphical calculus

From the precedent discussion, a @xmath -vacua Gaussian state is
described by the covariance matrix

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

After a generic Gaussian unitary transformation, represented by the
matrix @xmath is applied to @xmath , the resulting Gaussian state simply
has a covariance matrix given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

Exploiting the decomposition properties of symplectic matrices as shown
in [ 142 ] , we can rewrite the symplectic matrix @xmath using the
following unique decomposition

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.61)
  -- -- -- --------

where both @xmath and @xmath are @xmath symmetric matrices and @xmath .
The last matrix in the decomposition above does not contribute to the
@xmath product since it is orthogonal and @xmath , therefore one can
choose @xmath and @xmath . After these considerations, we define @xmath
as

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.62)
  -- -- -- --------

and the product @xmath is uniquely specified by @xmath , with the
covariance matrix @xmath equal to

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.63)
  -- -- -- --------

Therefore, it is clear that the complex (adjacency) matrix

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

offers an alternative description for a pure Gaussian state, since it is
a linear combination of the matrices that completely determine its
covariance matrix.

The matrix @xmath has a simple transformation rule under a symplectic
transformation @xmath . If @xmath is decomposed into block form

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.65)
  -- -- -- --------

then the @xmath matrix associated to the transformed state is given by [
92 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

The matrix @xmath represents a graph, in the sense that it is equivalent
to the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph with complex-valued edge
weights.

It is easy to establish the connection between the quadrature
correlations of the Gaussian state and its graph properties. From Eq.(
4.63 ) one notices that the left upper block of the covariance matrix
(where the @xmath -correlations are contained), is equal to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

Analogously, from the right upper block the matrix @xmath is related to
the quadrature correlations as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.68)
  -- -------- -- --------

and therefore, the @xmath matrix can be quickly rewritten as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.69)
  -- -------- -- --------

which shows how the @xmath matrix is related to the correlations of the
Gaussian state and vice-versa [ 92 ] . Because of this connection the
matrix @xmath shows up directly in the position-space wavefunction
@xmath for a @xmath -mode Gaussian state @xmath .

Recall that the most general position-space wavefunction of a single
mode Gaussian state with zero means (i.e. @xmath is equal, up to a
phase, to [ 140 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.70)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . Using the relations in Eq.( 4.67 - 4.69 ) one obtains the
@xmath -mode extension of the wave function as a function of @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.71)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a column vector of position-space variables.

##### Transformation rules and measurements

The usefulness of the graphical calculus lies in the simple
transformation rules of @xmath for the most common laboratory procedures
corresponding to Gaussian unitary transformation, as listed in [ 92 ] ,
which indeed permit the study of Gaussian states evolution simply in
terms of appropriate graph transformations on @xmath . To give an
example of these concepts, we note that for some generic @xmath -mode
gaussian state

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.72)
  -- -- -- --------

with @xmath a scalar, @xmath a column vector of length @xmath and @xmath
a @xmath matrix, any single-mode local Gaussian unitary represented by
the matrix

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.73)
  -- -- -- --------

acting on the first mode of @xmath , returns the transformed matrix:

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.74)
  -- -- -- --------

The simplest single-mode transformation is the quadrature squeezing,
performed by the unitary operator

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.75)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is known as the squeezing parameter . In the Heisenberg
picture,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.76)
  -- -------- -- --------

such that the variance of @xmath (or @xmath ), after squeezing, changes
by a factor of @xmath (of @xmath ) times from its original value. The
symplectic matrix associated to the single-mode @xmath -squeezing (
@xmath ) is

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.77)
  -- -- -- --------

Substituting the matrix elements into Eq.( 4.74 ) gives the @xmath
matrix of the state after the squeezing. Another Gaussian operation is
the phase shift @xmath , represented by

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.78)
  -- -- -- --------

which is equivalent to a single-mode Fourier transform for @xmath . From
@xmath and the form of ( 4.74 ) it is clear that the phase-shift
transformation can create additional edges on the graph.

Following the same logic, one constructs two-mode local Gaussian
transformations. The most useful for our purposes is the controlled-Z
gate @xmath , which correlates the two modes @xmath and adds a weighted
edge between the corresponding vertices in the graphical representation.
While the symplectic matrix for the @xmath is

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.79)
  -- -- -- --------

its action on some state @xmath is expressed by

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.80)
  -- -- -- --------

Measurements have a straightforward translation in the @xmath
transformation rules language. A @xmath measurement on the @xmath th
mode is equivalent to deleting the @xmath th row and column of the
@xmath matrix, see Fig.( 4.1 ) as an example, while a @xmath measurement
is equivalent to applying a @xmath phase shift, a Fourier transform, on
the @xmath th mode and then measuring the @xmath quadrature. At the
level of the @xmath matrix, any @xmath measurement deletes the measured
mode while creating new connections among its nearest neighbors [ 92 ] .

### 4.4 Discussion

In this Chapter we introduced the reader to the relevant concepts of
Gaussian states theory, analyzing the phase space representation and
demonstrating the dependance of the pure states bipartite entanglement
on the symplectic eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. Furthermore, we
illustrated the Graphical calculus for pure Gaussian states, which will
be used in Chapter 6 , and showed some examples of simple Gaussian
transformations.

## Chapter 5 Topological Order

The Holy Grail of quantum information theory is building a quantum
computer [ 32 ] . Nowadays there exist many proposals based on different
techniques for achieving this goal. From quantum computing with ion
traps [ 155 ] , superconducting quantum computation [ 156 ] , and all
the way up to adiabatic quantum computation [ 157 ] we have a number of
paths to start the quest, but so far no one of them has managed to prove
to be the fastest and more reliable way to take us to the final
destination. The main problem related to quantum computation is the
intrinsically ephemeral nature of quantum information. The environment
dramatically affects quantum systems, introducing errors that destroy
the fragile stability needed to run a quantum algorithm. This effect is
known as decoherence [ 24 , 158 ] .

The necessity to find a reliable solution against errors in the
computation suggested a different approach to quantum computing, based
on a class of systems known as topologically ordered [ 43 ] .
Topologically ordered systems form an unusual class of systems, whose
ordered phase cannot be described by Landau’s theory of spontaneous
symmetry breaking. Typically, transitions between different phases of
matter correspond to the loss (or gain) of symmetry by the state of the
system. However, the discovery of the fractional quantum Hall effect [
159 ] , where states that belong to different phases have equal
symmetries, opened to doors to the concept of topologically ordered
systems. Indeed, the physical properties of these systems are not
characterized by local order parameters, but rather by appropriate
non-local quantities that reflect their global topological properties [
39 ] .

Thanks to these topological properties, such systems store information
non-locally in logically stable structures, allowing for a more
efficient protection against external perturbations [ 43 ] . Moreover,
in two-dimensions they can serve as platforms where special
quasi-particles called anyons manifest [ 41 ] . The anomalous
statistical properties of anyonic excitations allow for the
implementation of quantum gates by braiding-like operations, and more in
general can be used to perform quantum computation [ 160 ] .

In this Chapter we examine the main ideas, techniques and subtleties
required to comprehend topological order, as a means to prepare the
ground for continuous-variable topological order in Chapter 6 . Our
starting point is the toric code [ 38 ] , a two-dimensional multi-spin
system defined on a discrete lattice, which is revered as the Godfather
of all topological systems. Because of its simple description, the toric
code has been widely used as a playground to understand the correlations
configuration of topological phases, and how these relate to the entropy
scaling for sub-partitions of the system [ 40 , 161 ] . We conclude the
Chapter by explaining how to detect topological order harnessing the
entanglement properties of the system [ 6 , 7 , 162 , 163 ] .

### 5.1 Quantum lattice systems

The toric code belongs to the extended family of quantum double models [
38 ] , a particular class of quantum many-body systems structurally
based on the properties of finite groups and physically defined on a
lattice [ 90 ] . This means that, given an underlying graph, the quantum
degrees of freedom are depicted by the vertices of the graph while the
edges connecting them determine the interactions. Consider a graph
@xmath , defined as in 4.3.1 , with @xmath set of vertices and @xmath
set of edges. One can introduce a distance @xmath measure between
vertices, which for us is just the shortest path connecting the vertices
on the graph. For nearest neighbors @xmath .

In general, quantum systems sitting at the vertices can either be spin
degrees of freedom of finite dimension or bosonic (fermionic) degrees of
freedom, associated to an infinitely dimensional Hilbert space.

As for the dynamics, in the following we will always be working with a
special class of Hamiltonians called local Hamiltonians

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where each term @xmath is supported only on the site @xmath and on a
finite number of neighboring sites, typically the nearest-neighbors.
Given the Hamiltonian @xmath we define the ground state manifold as the
Hilbert space whose basis states are the ground states, or states of
lowest energy, of @xmath . In general the ground state can be
degenerate.

The energy gap of the Hamiltonian is defined as the energy difference
between any ground state and the first excited state of the system

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the energy of the ground states. The energy gap is an
extremely important quantity in the study of topological quantum
systems: It directly relates to many of their properties, first of all
the resilience against external perturbations. It is also related to a
more subtle concept, the scaling behavior of the ground state
correlations along the subsystems of the lattice. For local operators
@xmath defined on a finite number of sites @xmath , the correlation
between two operators is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the ground state expectation value of @xmath . If @xmath
in the thermodynamic limit of @xmath number of vertices of the lattice,
then the correlations decay exponentially with the operators distance [
164 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the correlation length determining the distance on the
graph on which the correlations go to zero, and dist @xmath with @xmath
, @xmath vertices where the local operators @xmath act upon. However,
there is more than that. Consider a subsystem @xmath , where @xmath now
stands for the region of the subsystem on the lattice, of a gapped free
bosonic [ 165 , 166 ] or fermionic system [ 148 ] (free means that its
Hamiltonian is quadratic in the bosonic or fermionic operators). Then,
if @xmath represents the (pure) ground state of the system, the von
Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix @xmath scales as the size
of the boundary of @xmath [ 148 ] ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

This is an essential concept in the description of the entropic
properties of topological models. Only when an area law for the
entanglement entropy is satisfied, it is then possible to construct the
particular methods utilized to detect topological order by means of
linear combinations of entropies, as we discuss below in Section 5.3 .

In the following subsection we describe an example of quantum lattice
system, the cluster-state. While this is not related to quantum double
models, its generalization to continuous-variable will be used in
Chapter 6 as a platform for the implementation of the
continuous-variable surface code.

#### 5.1.1 The cluster-state

The cluster-state model is a quantum many-body system on a lattice that
was introduced as the physical platform to perform measurement-based
universal quantum computation [ 167 , 168 ] . A cluster-state is a
@xmath -qubit system associated to a (generally) two-dimensional square
graph @xmath , whose vertices correspond to qubits and whose edges
depict the interactions among them [ 169 ] . The cluster-state is the
result of a specific preparation procedure: One starts with a collection
of @xmath qubits equally prepared in the superposition state @xmath ,
such that the initial global state is @xmath . A controlled-Phase
(c-Phase) gate is then applied between pairs of neighboring qubits in
accord with a chosen graph, with one qubit per vertex of the graph.
Recall that the qubit c-Phase gate between two sites @xmath is given by
the unitary transformation [ 85 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

whose action on two spin states is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath . The cluster-state has a easier description in terms of
stabilizers ( 2.4 ). After the initialization of the spin states, but
before the application of the c-Phase gates, the stabilizer group of the
global state is simply given by the set @xmath , since @xmath .

On a two-dimensional square lattice, after creating the interactions
through c-Phase gates, the stabilizer set is transformed into a new set
equal to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath identifying the nearest neighbors of qubit @xmath , and with
N, S, E, and W indicating the qubit to the North, South, East and West
of qubit @xmath , respectively.

Finally, the cluster-state is the ground state of the Hamiltonian
constructed by imposing an energy penalty for violating any of the
stabilizers conditions:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

The description of experimental realizations of small cluster-states can
be found for example in [ 170 , 171 , 172 ] . For the sake of clarity,
universal quantum computation on a cluster-state is performed by means
of a mechanism known as one-way quantum computation. Here, instead of
performing logical gates on the individual qubits of the state, as in
the circuit-based model of quantum computing, one performs a sequence of
single-qubit projective measurements in order to establish the
equivalent of a quantum circuit on the state [ 173 ] .

### 5.2 Quantum double models

Topological phases of matter reveal themselves in systems usually
associated to gapped Hamiltonians with a degenerate ground state
subspace, whose degeneracy is determined by the geometric, or
topological, properties of the underlying manifold [ 39 ] .

Quantum double models @xmath , or surface codes , are a broad class of
well-studied lattice realizations of topologically ordered systems based
on the theory of error-correcting codes and introduced by Kitaev in [ 38
] . In particular, they are spin systems on a 2-dimensional lattice,
constructed starting from a finite group @xmath whose elements label an
orthonormal basis @xmath that define an Hilbert space @xmath with
dimension @xmath . Taken the graph of the lattice, with vertex set
@xmath , edge set @xmath and face set @xmath , we assign the Hilbert
space @xmath to each edge, in order to have a qudit-particle living on
every link with @xmath internal levels. The total Hilbert space of the
model is thus @xmath . An orientation is assigned to every edge @xmath ,
intended as an arrow pointing from one vertex to the other, and a global
one is assigned to all the faces (clockwise or counterclockwise) [ 41 ]
.

It is possible to define a local Hamiltonian for a quantum double model,
defining two set of operators. The first set @xmath describes the
interaction of the particles meeting at a vertex @xmath , while the
second set @xmath describes the interaction among particles sitting on
the boundary of a face @xmath . First recall that a particle state is
equivalent to @xmath . For instance, for the toric code @xmath and thus
the particle state is labeled by the elements @xmath . Then, introduce
the linear operators @xmath , whose action on a generic particle state
is [ 39 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Hamiltonian is constructed so that the ground state of the model is
invariant under the following local gauge transformations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

and it is equal to [ 38 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

The vertex operators @xmath project out states that do not satisfy the
local gauge invariance condition at @xmath , and are given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

The physical meaning of the face operators is inspired by the
interpretation of the quantum double models in terms of lattice gauge
theories, where each @xmath becomes a magnetic field on the face @xmath
[ 38 ] . Then the operators @xmath project out states with non-vanishing
magnetic flux at the face @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we are summing over series of group elements such that, for a face
boundary of size @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath identity element of @xmath , and the function @xmath whether
the face orientation is the same as the orientation of the edge @xmath
or not. For a square lattice with counterclockwise face orientation,
vertical links oriented upwards, horizontal links oriented rightwards
and edge labeling as in Fig. 5.1 , we have the following explicit
expressions:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is easy to check that the vertex and face operators are projectors
@xmath and that they all commute with each other and with the
Hamiltonian by construction. Moreover, the ground state @xmath of the
Hamiltonian satisfies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

and it is thus stabilized by the set of vertex and face operators, which
completely determines the ground state manifold.

##### Anyone anyons?

After this basic explanation of the theory of quantum doubles, let us
spend few words about anyons and the anyonic properties of such models.
Quantum double models are so called because the set of operators @xmath
and @xmath generate an algebra @xmath ¹ ¹ 1 There is more! The algebra
@xmath is a finite-dimensional @xmath -algebra, see 7.2.1 for the
precise meaning of @xmath -algebra and irreducible representation. that
is the quantum double of the original group @xmath , in the sense of [
174 ] . The ground state of a quantum double model corresponds to the
absence of anyons on the lattice, or simply to the anyonic vacuum .
Excited states are those states that do not satisfy the stabilizer
conditions in ( 5.18 ) and indicate the presence of quasi-particles on
the lattice. The particle’s types that are supported by a particular
quantum double model correspond one-to-one to irreducible
representations of the algebra @xmath [ 38 ] . In this sense the
properties of the anyons are dictated by the structure of the group
@xmath [ 39 ] .

An elementary excitation occurs when one of the stabilizer conditions is
violated. Anyons always exist in pairs and they are created at the
endpoints of a string that can be located on two vertices or two faces.
Astonishingly enough, anyons do not follow the bosonic or fermionic
statistic of particles exchange [ 42 ] . In three spatial dimensions and
one time dimension, when two point-like particles are exchanged, their
wave function will acquire either a plus (bosonic) or a minus
(fermionic) sign. In two spatial dimensions, things are different and
the wave function can acquire any phase under the braiding of two
particles [ 43 ] . Hence anyons obey a fractional statistics and in this
sense they elude the usual characterization of particles [ 175 ] .
Anyons are abelian if, after having braided one quasi-particle around
another (as long as they are different types), the wave-function of the
entire system acquires a @xmath phase that does not depend on the
specific form of the paths followed by the particles. Conversely,
non-abelian anyons have a more exotic behavior and realize unitary
transformation on the state when wrapped one around the other [ 160 ] .
These, together with their fusion properties, are at the basis of the
so-called topological, or anyonic, quantum computation [ 39 , 41 ] .
Hence, anyone anyons ² ² 2 This is A/Prof. Brennen’s favorite line about
anyons. ?

#### 5.2.1 The toric code state

The toric code [ 38 ] is the simplest topologically ordered system. It
serves as a fantastic toy-model for the study of topological properties
of most general models and it is usually used to show how quantum
information can be stored in a resilient way in a spin-system lattice.

We mentioned earlier that the toric code represents the basic
realization of a quantum double model, since it is the quantum double
@xmath of the group @xmath . It is an ensemble of @xmath qubits, @xmath
-spin particles, sitting on the edges of a @xmath square lattice with
toroidal boundary conditions, which does not require any explicit
orientation because of the simple group structure. The vertex operators
are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

while the face operators become

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath Pauli- @xmath and Pauli- @xmath operators respectively. From
Fig.( 5.1 ) it is clear that each vertex and face can only have 2 or no
sites in common and, from the Pauli operators commutation, it correctly
follows that all the @xmath and @xmath commute. Recall that these
operators are projectors, and consequently their eigenvalues are @xmath
. In analogy with ( 5.12 ), the Hamiltonian of the system is defined by
a linear combination of the stabilizers

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

and it can be diagonalized easily. This Hamiltonian commutes with all
the stabilizers and defines the qubit toric code. Again, the ground
state subspace of ( 5.21 ) is the space of all states stabilized by the
set @xmath , rigorously [ 38 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

If there were as many independent stabilizers as there are qubits on the
lattice, then the ground state of the toric code would be unique.
However, as a consequence of the constraints on the stabilizers

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

there are only @xmath independent stabilizers. This means that the
dimension of @xmath is @xmath and the ground state is four-degenerate [
176 ] . If the code was defined on a Riemannian surface with genus
@xmath , then the ground state subspace would be @xmath -degenerate [ 40
] . Thus, this should convince the reader that certain properties of the
system explicitly depend on the geometry of the underlying manifold.

Local spin operations create excitation pairs on the lattice, and the
group structure of @xmath defines the families of anyons supported by
the code. When in the ground state, the action of a single @xmath on a
spin creates a pair of @xmath -type anyons located inside the adjacent
faces, while a @xmath creates a pair of @xmath -type anyons on the two
adjacent vertices. There is a third kind of particle pairs @xmath which
is the composition of the first two excitations, explicitly @xmath [ 39
] .

Closed contractible loops of @xmath and @xmath operators on the lattice
leave the ground state invariant. Physically this corresponds to moving
one particle of the pair to the site of the other, annihilating them.
However, on the torus it is possible to construct 4 types of
non-contractible loops along the two spatial dimensions [ 40 ] . These
loops act as logical gates and, while still invariant with respect to
the ground state manifold, they transform one ground state basis vector
into another. In this sense the toric code can serve as a quantum
memory: The basis vectors of the 4-fold degenerate ground state manifold
encode two logical qubits in the model of the code.

### 5.3 Witnesses of topological order

Physically, topological order results from non-local long-range
correlations that extend across all the spins (or modes, as we will see
in the continuos-variable case in the following Chapter) of the system
in a topological phase. The resulting lack of a local order parameter
makes identifying topological order a difficult task, and a different
approach is required to identify it. In this section we deal with this
problem: First, we briefly analyze the entropic properties of a
topological system and then explain the concept of topological
entanglement entropy (TEE), an intrinsically non-local parameter that
has been appositely defined to characterize topological phases in a
variety of systems, including the toric code.

#### 5.3.1 Topological effects

The first hint regarding the topological effects on the bipartite
entropy of a region of the toric code (and consequently on the nature of
the TEE) was given in [ 40 , 161 ] , where the authors argued that the
entanglement entropy @xmath could help to detect topological order. By
calculating the entanglement entropy of an arbitrary bounded connected
region of the lattice for the toric code ground state, they found that
its value solely depends on the order of the group generated by the
vertex operators that act only on the boundary of the region, which is
equivalent to the boundary size, minus a constant ( @xmath ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

Moreover, it was understood that the correction to the area law behavior
of the entropy is due to the constraint on the number of independent
vertex operators @xmath . Another interesting conclusion is that,
although no two spins are correlated, there is no bipartition of the
system that gives a zero entropy. Also in this sense the ground states
of topological systems are multi-body, highly entangled states. Note
also that the result in 5.24 is independent of the choice of ground
state in case of degeneracy.

As a remark for the lovers of simplicity and beauty in Nature, in [ 177
] it was found an identical result for a theory based on a different
group in a different setup. Specifically, the entanglement entropy of a
closed boundary of space for pure three-dimensional Riemannian gravity,
formulated in terms of a topological BF theory for the gauge group
SU(2), scales in the very same same way as the toric code one:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the number of boundary loops across the cut.

#### 5.3.2 Topological entanglement entropy

These ideas were later broadened, and unambiguous relationships among
the apparently unrelated concepts of entanglement entropy, total quantum
dimension of the model, and topological entanglement entropy were
established. A topological system can support different types of anyons.
One can assign to each anyonic species @xmath a quantum dimension @xmath
, i.e. the dimension of the Hilbert space associated to the anyon.
Alternatively, the quantum dimension is the rate of growth of the
Hilbert space when we increase the number of particles @xmath by one.
The sum over all the quasiparticle species is the total quantum
dimension of the model [ 41 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

Both Kitaev and Preskill (KP) [ 6 ] and Levin and Wen (LW) [ 7 ]
intuited that, for a topologically ordered phase, the entanglement
entropy of a region @xmath scales as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath , @xmath is the size of the boundary of region @xmath ,
@xmath is a contribution that goes to zero in the limit of @xmath , and
the quantity

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

is exactly the topological entanglement entropy (TEE).

KP, by an appropriate selection of regions of the system, focus on
constructing a linear combination of entanglement entropies such that
all the terms proportional to the length of the boundaries of the
regions cancel out, leaving only the topological term. Specifically,
this corresponds to:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

Once the regions are chosen to be reasonably bigger than the correlation
length @xmath of the system, the parameter introduced in Eq. ( 5.4 )
that determines the exponential decay of the correlations of local
operators @xmath with respect to the ground state of the system

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

it is possible to demonstrate that deformations of the boundaries of the
regions, and smooth deformations of the system Hamiltonian, do not
change @xmath . Physically, this means that @xmath is both invariant,
hence only determined by the underlying topological properties, and
universal, i.e. local modifications of the Hamiltonian do not affect its
value.

LW moved along a different line of thought, considering partitions of
the system with different topologies rather than more general regions as
KP, see Fig. ( 5.2 ). The partitions are constructed such that their
pairwise differences are equivalent, and chosen to be large enough, so
that short-range correlations decay inside the boundaries. In analogy to
Eq. ( 5.29 ), an explicit expression for the TEE can be derived

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

If the system is not topologically ordered, and if the entanglement
entropies only depend on terms proportional to the boundaries, then the
differences in both Eq. ( 5.29 ) and Eq. ( 5.31 ) are exactly zero (up
to exponentially decaying corrections). But while in Eq. ( 5.29 ) this
corresponds to extracting @xmath directly by canceling the
area-dependent terms, the nonzero contribution in the LW construction is
less trivial. Analyzing the honeycomb lattice with spin- @xmath on the
edges [ 38 ] , LW prove that if topological long-range correlations are
present, non-local closed string operators with non-vanishing
expectation value exist [ 7 ] and operators that wind around the region
@xmath contribute to a lower value of the entropy @xmath . This
therefore corresponds to a nonzero value of Eq. ( 5.31 ). They indeed
call this contribution TEE.

The TEE is a witness for topological order in the following sense: the
value of @xmath characterizes the global anyonic and entanglement
properties of the topological state. When @xmath , it follows from Eq. (
5.28 ) that @xmath , which physically means that no anyons are supported
by the system, and no long-range topological correlations contribute to
the entanglement. The idea behind both the KP and LW derivations of the
TEE formulas is to suppress the non-topological correlations and extract
only the topological information.

#### 5.3.3 Topological order at finite temperature

For mixed states or states at finite temperature, the von Neumann
entropy does not quantify properly the amount of correlations shared by
two partitions of a system, and cannot be used as a parameter to detect
topological order. Instead, the appropriate signature of topological
order is given by a quantity called topological mutual information
(TMI), introduced in [ 162 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is calculated using the same regions of the KP construction for the
TEE, Fig.( 5.2 ). Now the correlations are measured using (one half of)
the quantum mutual information @xmath , see 2.2.2 , between a region A
of a system and its complement @xmath , i.e. @xmath , which replaces the
von Neumann entropy @xmath for a pure state (up to a factor of 2).

In [ 178 ] a modified version of the TMI was proposed to avoid
treacherous ambiguities in the recognition of topological order. In
fact, certain mixed states (in particular mixture of degenerate ground
states of gapped local Hamiltonians) can exhibit long-range non
topological correlations and therefore affect the value of the TMI.
Together with a new formulation for the TMI, the author also introduced
lower and upper bounds that precisely determine the TMI whenever they
coincide. Consider now the LW regions as defined in Fig.( 5.2 ) and
label @xmath , set difference of @xmath and @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath
(from which follows that @xmath ). Then the value of the TMI lies
between these two bounds:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

##### Topological logarithmic negativity

Recently [ 179 , 163 ] it has been proved that, for the toric code, also
the negativity and the logarithmic negativity scale with the boundary of
the region considered minus a topological constant related to the
topological entropy. We will exploit this additional property of
topological phases to give stronger evidence that our
continuous-variable model of harmonic oscillators on a lattice really
exhibits topological order.

### 5.4 Discussion

In this Chapter we gave a short overview about the theory of topological
quantum systems on 2-dimensional lattices, introducing the stabilizers
structure of local Hamiltonians and in particular the notion of
topological entanglement entropy. In the next Chapter we will extend
these concepts to continuos-variable states: Using Gaussian states
theory as a toolbox we demonstrate, through the witnesses of topological
order introduced here, that also the continuous-variable version of the
toric code can exhibit topological order.

## Chapter 6 Continuous-Variable Topological Phases

We have seen in the previous Chapter that the unusual properties of
topologically ordered systems, in particular the resilience against
local perturbations, make them attractive candidates for stable quantum
memories or processors [ 39 ] . However, probing topological order
experimentally is an onerous task. Some possibilities include measuring
non-local string operators [ 180 ] or the statistics of anyonic
excitations above the ground state, as has been demonstrated
experimentally with small photonic networks [ 181 ] . However, due to
finite correlation lengths of local operators [ 182 ] , these methods
suffer from low visibility if the system is not prepared in a pure phase
with vanishing two-point correlations.

An alternative is to study properties of the state itself that are
robust to small changes in the correlation length: For instance one
could consider the topological entanglement entropy (TEE) [ 6 , 7 ]
introduced previously in 5.3.2 , which is an intrinsically non-local
quantity that characterizes topological phases in a variety of systems,
including bosonic spin liquids [ 183 ] such as the qubit toric code [ 40
] , and fermionic Laughlin states [ 184 ] . While useful for numerics,
actually measuring TEE in a physical system is a daunting task, since
extracting the von Neumann entropy requires knowledge of the complete
spectrum of the reduced state.

In this Chapter we present a possible solution to this problem, studying
for the first time topological order in a continuous-variable Gaussian
state [ 45 ] analog of the discrete-variable surface code states [ 38 ]
introduced in 5.2 . As it happens, rather remarkably, we prove that the
TEE of the CV surface code can be easily computed simply from
measurements of the quadrature operators (introduced in 4.2 ). We also
show that unlike its qubit counterpart, the CV surface code state has a
parent Hamiltonian that is gapless in the thermodynamic limit.
Nevertheless, the quadrature correlations on the lattice still decay
exponentially with the distance.

After a short introduction to the CV formalism, we describe how to
prepare the CV surface code efficiently using an intermediate mapping to
first an ideal (infinitely squeezed) [ 46 , 47 ] and then a physical
(finitely squeezed) CV cluster-state [ 185 , 186 , 187 ] . The physical
CV cluster-state is the ground state of a quadratic Hamiltonian
constructed, in analogy with the quantum double models, using the
elements of the nullifier sets: We study its spectrum and show that in
the thermodynamic limit it is gapless. The central part of the Chapter
deals with the problem of detecting topological order: After showing how
to derive the covariance matrix @xmath of the CV surface code using the
graphical calculus for pure Gaussian states ( [ 92 ] and 4.3 ), we prove
the exponential decay of the correlations studying the special form of
@xmath . We then calculate the topological entanglement entropy and the
topological logarithmic negativity [ 179 , 163 ] , following the methods
introduced in Chapter 5 . These quantities are non-zero for any value of
the initial squeezing. We continue by analyzing the stability of the CV
topological order against two forms of noise: thermalization and noisy
input states. To conclude, we propose experimental realizations for this
model that are accessible with today’s technology.

### 6.1 Continuous-variable generalities

We have already introduced the Gaussian states formalism in Chapter 4
and presented the qubit-based cluster-state [ 167 , 168 ] in 5.1.1 . In
order to extend the cluster-states and surface codes formalism to
continuous-variable states, we need to introduce the language in which
continuous-variable logic is spoken. As a first thing we must generalize
the Pauli group of single qubit gates ( 2.10 ) to the Weyl-Heisenberg
group of phase-space displacements ¹ ¹ 1 Additional information about
this group is presented in 7.3 [ 68 ] . For a single qubit, this
generalization is most easily accomplished by thinking of the qubit
@xmath and @xmath gates as implementing one-unit cyclic shifts in
‘position’

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

and ‘momentum’

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

The CV analogs of the qubit gates are the translation (position-shift)
operator @xmath and boost (momentum-shift) operator @xmath , with @xmath
. While for qubits the shift is by an element of the cyclic group @xmath
, i.e. the gates transform a basis element into the other, in the CV
case, one may implement a shift in position or momentum by any real
valued amount. In fact, the Weyl-Heisenberg group for
continuous-variables is a continuous Lie group, whose generators are the
elements of the Lie algebra spanned by the identity operator @xmath and
the canonical self-adjoint quadrature operators @xmath , @xmath , which
satisfy the canonical commutation relation @xmath [ 67 ] .

Specifically, the displacement operators are equal to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

with group commutator

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

The action of the displacement operators on the eigenstates (or
continuous computational basis) of @xmath and @xmath is given by [ 137 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the subscript means that @xmath and @xmath . Then, the Pauli group
@xmath for CV quantum computation on @xmath oscillators is simply given
by the set @xmath with generating algebra @xmath for @xmath .

The transformations we will use in the following discussion belong to
the Clifford group for continuous-variable @xmath [ 68 ] . This is the
group of transformations that preserve @xmath under conjugation, i.e.
that given any @xmath , then @xmath for every @xmath . In this way we
enforce the requirement that all the operations we perform on the state
transform stabilizer operators into stabilizer operators, see 2.4 .

The CV Clifford group is the semi-direct product of the Pauli group
@xmath and @xmath , the real symplectic group met in 4.1.1 . From the
definition, it is clear that CV Clifford operations are Gaussian
operations. Moreover, because of the algebraic structure of @xmath one
can prove that it is generated only by four operations [ 68 , 188 ] ,
namely:

-   The translation operator @xmath ;

-   The Fourier transform operator @xmath , which is the CV analog of
    the Hadamard operator for qubits and act on the continuous
    computational basis as @xmath and @xmath ;

-   The phase gate @xmath ;

-   The generalization to CV of the controlled-PHASE gate from 5.1.1 ,
    now called controlled- @xmath gate and represented by the operator
    @xmath ;

Although these operations do not form a universal set of gates for CV
quantum computation [ 68 , 137 ] , together with quadrature measurements
they are sufficient to prepare the CV surface codes and detect
topological order [ 5 ] . Note that the single-mode squeezing
transformation @xmath , from 4.3.2 , belongs to the Clifford group.

All the transformations just shown have a representation in the
graphical calculus for Gaussian pure states, as explained in 4.3 . For
the full list of graph transformation rules see [ 92 ] .

### 6.2 Ideal continuous-variable codes

We start the description of the continuous-variable models introducing
the so-called ideal codes [ 47 , 188 ] . These codes are called ideal,
or infinitely squeezed, because they represent unphysical states of
infinite energy and therefore are not normalizable. Although these codes
are mere mathematical approximation without an equivalent physical
state, they play the role of theoretical CV analog of the qubit
cluster-state and Kitaev’s surface codes, being also the limiting case
of the physical states that will be introduced in the next section.

#### 6.2.1 The ideal continuous-variable cluster-states

The continuous-variable surface code can be easily described and
efficiently prepared using an intermediate mapping to the
continuous-variable cluster-state via a simple pattern of quadrature
measurements: Hence, this will be our starting point. Intuitively, the
CV cluster-state is the CV analog of its qubit-based cousin [ 167 ] .
There are many ways to construct physical CV cluster-states [ 46 , 47 ,
185 , 186 , 187 , 48 , 189 ] , all of which give slightly different
states in the finitely squeezed case [ 92 ] . Each has important
differences that manifest when using them for measurement-based quantum
computation. In the ideal, infinitely squeezed case, however, these
differences become largely irrelevant, and since infinitely squeezed
states are unphysical anyway, we are free to choose for their analysis
the method that is simplest. For this reason we choose the canonical
method [ 46 ] : Despite its inefficiency when used in practice [ 190 ] ,
this is the most straightforward generalization of the qubit
cluster-state preparation procedure described in 5.1.1 .

Given a square lattice defined on a graph @xmath ( 4.3.1 ), we first
substitute the @xmath qubits on the vertices with @xmath qumodes
initialized in the infinitely-squeezed zero-momentum eigenstate @xmath ,
which is equivalent to the @xmath state for qubits. The global state is
therefore @xmath , and this is stabilized by the single mode operators
@xmath in the sense that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

Alternatively, the same state is nullified, as expected, by the set
@xmath of generators of the stabilizer group since,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

As in the qubit case, the ideal CV cluster-state @xmath is the result of
the pairwise application of controlled-Z gates @xmath upon all the
nearest-neighbor modes @xmath of the initial state @xmath as depicted by
the graph, explicitly

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

How does the application of these gates affect the stabilizer set? Under
the @xmath evolution, the quadrature operators transform as (see B.1 in
Appendix B and [ 191 ] )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.9)
     @xmath      (6.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the initial state stabilizers @xmath are changed into the
cluster-state stabilizers

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

which have the same form of the qubit cluster-state stabilizers in Eq. (
5.8 ). We can also express these stabilizers by [ 92 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

equivalent to define the elements of the CV cluster-state nullifier set
@xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

All the @xmath (and linear combinations of them) commute, and are the
elements of the algebra that generates the stabilizer group of @xmath .
In complete analogy with the qubit case, we can construct a Hamiltonian
@xmath whose ground state is the CV cluster-state @xmath by imposing an
energy penalty for violating any of the nullifier conditions:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since all nullifiers commute and have a continuous spectrum of
eigenvalues @xmath , this Hamiltonian also has a continuous spectrum
@xmath , and is therefore gapless [ 47 ] , see also ( B.1.1 ) in
Appendix B .

##### Non-unit edge weights

It is worth pointing out that even at the ideal level there is some
additional freedom in the CV cluster-state construction procedure. In
particular, ideal CV cluster-state graphs can have any nonzero
real-valued weight @xmath associated with each edge. This modifies the
strength of the @xmath gate represented by that edge: @xmath . These
weights were first introduced in [ 185 ] as a way to enable new methods
of construction. They have shown themselves to be very important for the
computational properties of these states [ 192 ] and when considering
efficient construction of cluster-states with very large graphs [ 187 ,
189 , 92 ] . For the purposes of all future derivations in this Thesis,
we set @xmath . However, when describing possible experimental
implementations of the CV codes at the end of this Chapter, we will show
how the results obtained with this assumption apply indistinctly to CV
cluster-states constructed with non-unit–but still uniform weight @xmath
.

#### 6.2.2 The ideal continuous-variable surface code

In this section we present the description of the continuous-variable
surface code. We start introducing the stabilizer description for a
general lattice implementation, and then look at the special case of a
planar square lattice with defined orientations.

The ideal CV cluster-state on a square lattice can be transformed into
the corresponding ideal CV surface code by a simple scheme of quadrature
measurements [ 188 ] , which was inspired by the dynamical mapping of
qubit cluster-states to surface codes [ 193 ] . In short, start with the
CV cluster-state and label vertices by row and column. Then measure in
@xmath those modes on rows and columns that are both odd and in @xmath
those that are both even, as in Fig.( 6.1 ) for the case of a square
lattice.

The measurements change the form of the stabilizers [ 92 ] , and
therefore after the measurements we are left with a state described by a
new set of nullifiers that corresponds exactly to the CV analog of
Kitaev’s surface codes, as we show in Appendix B .

To continue with the analysis is convenient to borrow notation from the
qudit version of surface codes [ 194 ] , which describes the nature of
the coupling involved in the nullifiers in terms of a surface code graph
@xmath . We assume the graph is oriented and that the faces inherit this
orientation. Each quantum mode reside on an edge @xmath , with the
orientation of any edge determined by @xmath for the base of the edge
starting at vertex @xmath and the head at vertex @xmath .

In this very general case, the stabilizers for the CV surface code are
given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (6.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the symbols in these expressions denote:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.16)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

and the dot ( @xmath ) stands for any vertex. By construction, the
stabilizers commute:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

The CV surface code subspace is the @xmath co-eigenspace of the
stabilizers @xmath and @xmath , in complete analogy with Kitaev’s
surface codes [ 39 ] .

To simplify the discussion, and to compare our results directly with the
toric code state, we specialize to the case of the code graph @xmath
being a toroidal square lattice. In the following discussion, we will
always stick with this choice, fixing the edge orientations such that at
any vertex @xmath , all incident edges point toward @xmath , or all
point away from @xmath and the faces inherit equal counterclockwise
orientation; see Fig.( 6.2 ). Under these assumptions, the symbol @xmath
is a constant @xmath for any vertex @xmath and it only amounts to a sign
flip on @xmath in Eq.( 6.15 ), which has no effect on a stabilizer’s
role as such, and we can ignore it.

In this case, the CV stabilizers function as the CV analogs of the
surface code stabilizers for qubits from Eq. ( 5.19 ) and Eq. ( 5.20 )
(up to a @xmath swap)

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

and explicitly become

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the stabilizers generators, i.e the nullifiers, are:

  -- -- -------- -- --------
        @xmath      
        @xmath      (6.20)
  -- -- -------- -- --------

If, on the boundary, one of the edges is missing, then that mode is not
included in the nullifiers. It should be clear that the choice of the
orientation is purely conventional and does not change the state. Hence,
if we were to flip the orientation of every edge, @xmath simply becomes
@xmath , which is still a nullifier.

The ideal CV surface code is the non-normalizable ground state of the
quadratic Hamiltonian [ 188 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

In analogy with the ideal cluster-state Hamiltonian, the spurious mode
operators @xmath and @xmath are actually Hermitian quadrature operators
that all commute, and because of

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (6.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

an extensive number of gapless modes exist. Therefore this Hamiltonian
has a fully continuous spectrum @xmath and is gapless for any number of
systems, even on a square lattice with boundary. Anyonic braiding in
this model was studied in [ 188 , 195 , 196 ] .

### 6.3 Physical continuous-variable codes

Ideal states are mathematical representations of states that cannot be
produced in the laboratory. While the ideal CV surface code is the
perfect analog of the qubit toric code, with experimental realization in
mind we are required to speak about states that have actual physical
significance and can be implemented experimentally. In this section, we
consider physical realizations of the ideal states, or more
specifically, we analyze the case of finite squeezing.

#### 6.3.1 Physical continuous-variable cluster-state

Similarly to the previous section, we start considering the CV
cluster-state first [ 46 ] . We follow the canonical method again:
starting from @xmath vacuum modes @xmath . The elements of the initial
nullifier set are simply the dimensionless single-mode annihilation
operators @xmath , since

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

These states are then all squeezed by @xmath , squeezing operator with
squeezing parameter @xmath ( 4.75 ), in contrast with the ideal case,
where one starts directly with @xmath zero-eigenstates of the
quadratures @xmath , i.e. @xmath . The squeezing is followed by the
pairwise @xmath coupling, yielding the transformed nullifiers (see
Appendix B for the details of this transformation):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

These operators satisfy the canonical commutation relations for normal
mode operators,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

and therefore the CV cluster-state Hamiltonian can be written as [ 48 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

For finite @xmath , the system as a gap of @xmath . The prefactor
provides for finite energy even in the limit of infinite squeezing,
where @xmath .

#### 6.3.2 Physical continuous-variable surface code

Using the same measurement pattern shown in Fig.( 6.1 ), the finitely
squeezed CV cluster-state can be mapped to the finitely squeezed CV
surface code. While the necessary steps to derive the nullifiers are
once more outlined in Appendix B , for the case of a square lattice with
toroidal boundary conditions, the precise nullifiers follow from Eq. (
B.4 ):

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath               
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.27)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . Note that now also the next-nearest neighbors contribute
to the structure of the nullifiers, in contrast to the ideal case, as
illustrated in Fig. ( 6.3 ).

Without loss of generality we can consider a square @xmath lattice: Then
the nullifiers commutation relations from Eq. ( B.4 ) can be rewritten
as

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (6.28)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are the Euclidean distance between vertices and
faces, respectively on the unit-edge-length lattice and dual lattice.
The functions @xmath and @xmath are given by:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.29)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using these nullifiers we can construct a Hamiltonian for the physical
CV surface code:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

The squeezing dependence of the prefactors is done to ensure the
Hamiltonian has finite energy for @xmath .

Having described the very basics of the CV surface code, we will proceed
exploring the defining properties of this model. We start with an
analytical calculation of the energy gap of the Hamiltonian from Eq. (
6.31 ), showing that the system is gapless in the thermodynamic limit.
Nonetheless, we will demonstrate analytically that the ground state
correlations decay exponentially on the lattice despite the zero gap,
and utilize different quantities to numerically prove topological order
for the surface code state. Remarkably, all these quantities can be
easily computed from quadrature measurements.

##### Energy gap

Unlike the discrete-variable case [ 40 , 161 ] , the Hamiltonian @xmath
is gapless in the thermodynamic limit of infinite modes. This happens
because the nullifiers of the most general physical CV surface code in
Eq.( B.4 ) do not define normal modes, since the non-trivial commutation
relations of the neighboring nullifiers allow for low-energy mode
excitations.

On the @xmath torus, the specifics of the graph are @xmath , @xmath ,
and @xmath [ 154 ] . We first focus on the case where @xmath is odd, so
that there are @xmath independent nullifiers that therefore span the
space of all the physical-mode annihilation operators. We want to
diagonalize the Hamiltonian, and to do so we introduce the normal-mode
operators

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the vertices at the lattice sites have coordinates @xmath , and
the faces at the dual lattice sites have coordinates @xmath . In this
base the Hamiltonian is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

To find the normal-mode frequencies, we need to solve the equations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the equality is ensured by @xmath , and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath . If we introduce the generic vertex label state @xmath and
the face label state @xmath , the two linear equations above can be
vectorized and rewritten in these two basis respectively as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are the vectorized form of the operators @xmath
and @xmath that result from Eq. ( 6.32 ). In the following, we define
operators for a periodic square lattice that make the problem solvable.
First, define the shift operator @xmath , whose action on the generic
vertex label state @xmath is:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (6.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

The action of the shift operator on the face basis is completely
analogous. This allows to rewrite the matrices @xmath and @xmath , whose
elements are non-zero according to the form of the commutation relations
in Eq. ( 6.3.2 ), in the following elegant way:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.38)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

The linear equations in Eq. ( 6.36 ) can be solved in the Fourier basis
via @xmath , where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the nullifiers in the Fourier basis are decomposed as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this way, the solutions written in the basis @xmath and @xmath are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
                 
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (6.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

treating the normal mode index @xmath as a collective index. Then, the
(squeezing-dependent) gap energy is the lowest-frequency mode energy:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

For large system sizes, i.e. @xmath , and choosing freely that @xmath ,
the gap is equal to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

and in the thermodynamic limit @xmath the gap goes to zero.

If @xmath and @xmath are even, then not all the face nullifiers are
independent. To see this simply bicolor all the lattice faces and assign
a plus sign to face operators of one color and a minus sign to faces of
the other, then add them to get zero. Thus, the Hamiltonian @xmath is
underconstrained, and there exists an exact gapless zero mode. For a
square lattice with planar boundaries (and not toroidal as we discussed
so far), there are boundary effects, but these make only a small
modification to the gap, which still scales like the inverse of the
system size.

To conclude, we have proved that in distinction to the cluster-state
Hamiltonian @xmath ( 6.26 ), the surface code Hamiltonian @xmath ( 6.31
) is gapless in the thermodynamic limit, although for infinite squeezing
both models are gapless. This may not sound promising, since the qubit
toric code state is gapped [ 38 ] , and usually topologically ordered
states are associated with gapped parent Hamiltonians that provide
dynamical stability. However, there are other instances of topologically
ordered gapless models in two dimensions, such as quantum loop gases:
They have been investigated in different contexts, see for example [ 197
, 198 ] . In the following section we prove that, although our CV
surface code model happens to be gapless, it still obeys an area law and
exhibits topological order.

### 6.4 Detecting topological order in the continuous-variable surface
code

Our aim in this Chapter is to prove that the CV cluster-state, in
analogy with the qubit-based cluster-state [ 40 , 161 ] , is
topologically ordered. To accomplish this objective we exploit the
Gaussian properties of the physical CV cluster-state: In fact, the
ground state of the Hamiltonian in Eq. ( 6.31 ) is Gaussian, since the
procedure to construct it makes use only of Gaussian transformations and
quadrature measurements.

The easiest approach to test topological order is by computing the
topological entanglement entropy (TEE) for the state and check whether
it is bigger than zero or not. Computation of the TEE requires
calculating the entanglement entropy for different regions of the
system, which is generally very complicated. However, as we have seen in
Chapter 4 , for Gaussian states this reduces to having complete
knowledge of the state covariance matrix, from which calculating the
entanglement entropy of any subsystem is as easy as stealing candies
from a mathematician.

In this section we first show how to derive the covariance matrix of the
CV surface code state making use of the graphical calculus for pure
Gaussian states. Then we study the behavior of the correlations, proving
analytically that they decay exponentially with the graph distance.
Under this assumption we are allowed to use the two formulas for the
TEE. Finally we present our numerical results and confirm that the state
is topologically ordered with a TEE that asymptotically grows linearly
with the squeezing parameter @xmath . To give additional evidence to
this result, we also test the state against two other witnesses of
topological order, the topological mutual information and the
topological logarithmic negativity.

#### 6.4.1 Graphical representation

We start the discussion by showing how to represent the physical CV
cluster-state using the graphical calculus [ 92 ] . This will provide us
with a straightforward method to calculate the covariance matrix of the
state.

Both qubit cluster-states and the qubit surface code state can be
represented by graphs. However, their definitions in terms of graphs are
incompatible. In particular, qubit cluster-states (or qubit “graph
states”, as they are often confusingly called in the literature,
although cluster-states are just a specific form of graph states) are
represented by graphs that act as a well-defined recipe for creating the
state, in the sense that nodes represent qubits prepared in @xmath
state, and the edges denote controlled-PHASE gates between them. While
it is not necessary to make cluster-states this way, any cluster-state
can be so constructed.

Nonetheless, if this recipe is applied to the graphs for qubit surface
code states, one fails because for the surface code the qubits live on
the edges, while faces and vertices define stabilizers in terms of all
@xmath ’s or all @xmath ’s. Hence there is no analog for this in the
graph recipe used to define qubit cluster-states, and although one can
define by fiat a connection between the two types of graphs, it is at
best a patch-up job.

In contrast with the discrete-variable case, we have seen in 4.3 that
the graphical calculus for Gaussian pure states offers a unified
graphical representation of any Gaussian pure state in terms of a recipe
for its creation. Again, one does not have to follow this recipe to
construct a Gaussian state, but any Gaussian state can be prepared
following the instructions defined uniquely by its graph. As such, since
both the CV cluster-states and the CV surface code are Gaussian, only
one type of graph is needed. Furthermore, the measurement pattern that
connects these two types of states has definite graph transformation
rules ( 4.3.2 ), so the connection between the two graphs can be
directly derived using the graphical calculus instead of invented ad hoc
patches between two inequivalent kinds of graphs, as in the qubit case ²
² 2 One can use the Clifford group representation for the qubit case in
an analogous sense. .

The @xmath -mode physical CV cluster-state can be directly and uniquely
represented by the undirected, complex-weighted graph whose adjacency
matrix is @xmath , making solely use of the additional adjacency matrix
@xmath that describes the square-lattice pattern of interactions among
the modes [ 92 , 5 ] . Explicitly:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

with squeezing parameter @xmath and @xmath the @xmath unit matrix. This
is illustrated in Fig.( 6.5 ).

To derive the graph of the finitely squeezed CV cluster-state with open
boundary conditions, we start with @xmath and perform the measurement
scheme as shown in Fig.( 6.1 ), with the advantage that measurements
have a straightforward translation in the @xmath transformation rules
language as explained in 4.3.2 . We repeat them, noting that a @xmath
measurement on the @xmath -th mode is equivalent to deleting the @xmath
-th row and column of the @xmath matrix, while a @xmath measurement is
equivalent to applying a @xmath phase shift on the @xmath -th mode and
then measuring (on the same mode) the @xmath quadrature.

Then the @xmath matrix transforms into the CV finitely squeezed surface
code state @xmath , shown in Fig.( 6.4 ) [ 5 ] . In this case, it is a
purely imaginary matrix whose entries are given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

and @xmath is the unweighted adjacency matrix of the surface code
(without self-loops, see Fig. 6.4 ). Note that the @xmath component of
the @xmath matrix, see Eq. ( 4.64 ), is zero for the surface code. Using
the connection between @xmath matrix and covariance matrix from Eq.(
4.63 ), we finally derive the covariance matrix of the physical CV
surface code state:

  -- -- -- --------
           (6.47)
  -- -- -- --------

Complete knowledge of the covariance matrix makes calculations of
entanglement entropy for different regions of the system
straightforward.

#### 6.4.2 Quadrature correlations on the lattice

The covariance matrix @xmath allows us to study the @xmath and @xmath
-correlations for the modes of the surface code [ 3 ] . In fact, if we
have a look at the generic formulation for the covariance matrix, Eq.(
4.14 ):

  -- -- -- --------
           (6.48)
  -- -- -- --------

and compare it with the expressions in Eq. ( 6.46 ) and Eq. ( 6.47 ),
one can immediately notice that the @xmath -correlations are non-zero
exclusively in the nearest neighborhood of each mode, due to the
particular form of the matrix @xmath . Furthermore, the form of the
covariance matrix tells us that the @xmath - @xmath -correlations are
zero everywhere. On the other hand, because of the presence of the
@xmath term, the @xmath -correlations require a more elaborate analysis.
The exponential decay of the quadrature correlations is a necessary
assumption to use the topological entropy formulas, as explained in
Chapter 5 . Numerical values of the @xmath -correlations along the main
axes of the system are shown for a few values of the initial squeezing
in Fig. ( 6.6 ). In the following we provide bounds on the correlations
for arbitrary squeezing.

In [ 5 ] we show that the spectral range of @xmath , denoted @xmath ,
satisfies @xmath where @xmath and @xmath . On a generic @xmath lattice,
the @xmath matrix @xmath is block tridiagonal with @xmath identical
@xmath matrices @xmath on the diagonal and identical @xmath on the
immediate upper and lower blocks. Now the matrix coordinates @xmath
correspond to Euclidean coordinates @xmath on the lattice, where @xmath
for @xmath and @xmath , etc. It is convenient to define a graph distance
@xmath between coordinates @xmath and @xmath . Since, away from the
edges, the bulk of the @xmath graph is the union of a square graph with
a graph having two diagonal edges passing through every other face, the
graph distance is the number of edges on the shortest path between
@xmath and @xmath , and it satisfies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the Euclidean distance. The matrix @xmath is itself
tridiagonal with elements @xmath on the main diagonal and @xmath on the
immediate upper and lower diagonal. The matrix @xmath is also
tridiagonal with diagonal elements @xmath and immediate upper and lower
diagonal elements either equal to zero or @xmath . A theorem of Demko,
Moss and Smith [ 199 , 200 ] shows that banded matrices of a certain
class have inverses with matrix elements that decay exponentially with
the distance from the diagonal. Specifically they show for matrices
@xmath of size @xmath and spectral range @xmath with @xmath [Ref. [ 199
] Proposition 5.1]:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the decay sets are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the support sets are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Here @xmath and @xmath .

The matrices relevant to our problem are in this class. The matrix power
@xmath is a banded block symmetric matrix with blocks of size @xmath and
block band width @xmath . Furthermore, each such block is banded with
band width @xmath . Thus the support set @xmath is the set of those
matrix coordinates @xmath such that the graph distance @xmath , is no
more that @xmath . Similarly, the decay set is all matrix coordinates
outside the support set. The statement in Eq. ( 6.50 ) means that for
nodes separated in graph distance @xmath , with associated matrix
coordinates @xmath , the inverse matrix element @xmath falls off
exponentially with graph distance as @xmath .

This implies that the position correlations between nodes @xmath and
@xmath separated in graph distance by @xmath satisfy

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the constant is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the correlation length is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

as we wished to prove.

#### 6.4.3 Proof of topological order

After this long and slightly tedious introduction, we are ready to give
a proof that the CV surface code is topologically ordered. A key feature
of topological phases is the absence of local parameters that allow to
detect them. The exponential decay of the correlations ensures area law
behavior of the entropy, which is the necessary condition for using the
topological entanglement entropy (TEE) formulas in Eq. ( 5.29 ) and
Eq. ( 5.31 ), while the complete knowledge of the covariance matrix
allows calculations of the entanglement entropy between different
regions of the system. For instance, consider a generic set of modes
@xmath , which corresponds to a region of the lattice. To calculate the
entanglement entropy @xmath , it is enough to derive the proper reduced
covariance matrix @xmath deleting from @xmath the rows and columns
corresponding to the modes in @xmath , the complementary set of @xmath .
Then one extracts the symplectic eigenvalues and applies the formula in
Eq. ( 4.29 ), as explained in Section 4.2 . Also recall that the TEE
formulas we use are [ 6 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

and [ 7 ]

     @xmath      (6.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

with regions shown in Figs. 5.2 a and 5.2 b, respectively. If the system
is not topologically ordered, these combinations (i.e. @xmath ) are
exactly zero. In our simulations, we use the @xmath square bulk of a
larger CV surface code state. Selecting from the covariance matrix
@xmath the reductions corresponding to regions of the lattice chosen as
prescribed by the formulas in Eq.( 6.53 ) and Eq.( 6.54 ), we evaluate
the TEE as a function of the initial squeezing.

In Fig.( 6.7 ) we show our results [ 5 ] . While the caption of the
figure explains in detail what the symbols indicate, we wish to comment
on these findings. First of all, note that even for @xmath , which
corresponds to starting (in the CV cluster-state preparation) with
vacuum states instead of momentum-squeezed states, the TEE is very small
but non-zero. This is not a numerical artifact but a consequence of
applying the controlled- @xmath gates, which introduce additional
squeezing [ 190 , 201 ] to input vacuum states. It is worth noting that
the values of the TEE calculated using the KP formula ( 6.53 ) and the
LW formula ( 6.54 ) are extremely close for relatively large squeezing,
and the difference accounts for numerics approximation, as expected.
However, on the inset the difference is greater that the absolute values
of @xmath and @xmath : This is due to the different formulas used, which
result in different values of @xmath for small squeezing. As a sanity
check, we also calculated the TEE for a large ( @xmath modes ³ ³ 3 The
CV cluster-state TEE must be zero for any system size ) CV
cluster-state, which proves to be zero for any value of the squeezing.
This is in complete analogy with the qubit-based cluster-state, which
does not exhibit topological order.

Further, we plot the Topological Log-Negativity (TLN) for the KP
regions, because of recent results that show this quantity to be a good
witness of topological order for stabilizer states of Abelian anyon
models [ 163 , 179 ] . For a global state with covariance matrix @xmath
, as in our case ( 6.47 ), the log-negativity of the reduced state with
support on a subsystem @xmath is [ 83 , 149 ] ⁴ ⁴ 4 Note that in [ 149 ]
the authors define the logarithmic negativity in the same way we do in
Eq. ( 6.55 ), but forget an important @xmath overall factor in the
definition. :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath , with @xmath being the projector onto the modes in region
@xmath [ 149 ] and @xmath being the @xmath -th eigenvalue of the matrix
argument. Then the TLN is constructed replacing the von Neumann entropy
with the logarithmic negativity corresponding to the same region,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

Remarkably, we find that the TLN is a tight upper bound on the TEE with
the same asymptotic slope.

To obtain this slope, we derived an upper bound (details can be found in
Appendix C ) to the TEE by considering the smallest meaningful portion
of the surface code. Specifically, the upper bound is the entanglement
entropy of a one-mode subsystem of a three-mode correlated state. The
squeezing-dependent symplectic eigenvalue of the reduced covariance
matrix corresponding to the chosen mode is given by @xmath , and the
exact value of the upper bound for the TEE is represented by the
straight line in Fig. ( 6.7 ), with an asymptotic slope of @xmath .

#### 6.4.4 Noise model

To conclude the analysis, we check the resilience of the CV topological
phase against noise in the state preparation [ 5 ] . Errors in the
construction of the finitely-squeezed CV cluster-state can be modeled by
considering a thermal state with respect to the CV cluster-state
Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

as the pre-measurement initial state. Such a state could be generated by
several different physical mechanisms. One scenario is in a network of
non-interacting photons: One could start with @xmath separable thermal
modes as input states instead of the momentum-squeezed vacuum states
considered in the theory explained before. Each one of these thermal
states is described by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

with inverse temperature parameter @xmath . It follows that the thermal
cluster-state can be generated by subsequent unitary operations via
squeezing, beams splitters, and phase shifters in analogy with the
procedure for the pure CV cluster-state. Another scenario is to engineer
the Hamiltonian @xmath , which is gapped for finite squeezing, and then
wait until the system reaches equilibrium with an environment at
temperature @xmath . Eventually, the thermal CV surface code is derived
from the thermal cluster-state by quadrature measurements, exactly as
explained for the pure case.

We have seen in 5.3.3 that for such mixed states topological order can
be detected by making use of the topological mutual information (TMI) [
162 ] . The TMI is constructed replacing in Eq. ( 6.53 ) the von Neumann
entropy @xmath with (half of) the mutual information @xmath between a
region @xmath and its complement @xmath , precisely:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

Calculations of the values for the TMI still require knowledge of the
covariance matrix of the system (together with its reductions) and its
symplectic spectrum. Unfortunately, for mixed states we cannot use the
graphical calculus for Gaussian states to derive the covariance matrix,
since it only applies to pure states. In spite of that, for this
particular system things are easier than one might expect and the
covariance matrix of the thermal CV surface code state can be calculated
in a rather simple way. First of all, it is straightforward to see that
any initial state composed of @xmath equal non-interacting thermal modes
is a Gaussian state with covariance matrix given by

  -- -- -- --------
           (6.60)
  -- -- -- --------

and characterized by the parameter

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath energy gap of the finitely squeezed CV cluster-state. Any
Gaussian operation @xmath performed on @xmath is easily computed
noticing that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.62)
  -- -------- -- --------

and therefore the mixed CV cluster-state covariance matrix corresponding
to the density matrix ( 6.57 ) is just given by @xmath , with @xmath
covariance matrix of the pure CV cluster-state. In order to check how
the covariance matrix @xmath maps to the covariance matrix for the mixed
surface code state after the quadrature measurements, we have to
translate the effect of measurements into the covariance matrix
language. Take a @xmath covariance matrix @xmath : If we perform a
measurement on the @xmath -th mode (this can be easily generalized to
any mode), then @xmath is

  -- -- -- --------
           (6.63)
  -- -- -- --------

where @xmath is the reduced @xmath covariance matrix of the first @xmath
modes, @xmath is the reduced matrix for the measured mode @xmath , and
@xmath is the @xmath matrix that keeps track of the intra-modes
correlations. A @xmath measurement on the @xmath mode results in a new
covariance matrix given by [ 202 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -- -- --------
           (6.65)
  -- -- -- --------

and @xmath is the pseudo-inverse (or Moore-Penrose inverse [ 203 ] ) of
the singular matrix @xmath . For a @xmath measurement one has instead [
202 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since the covariance matrix of the mixed CV cluster-state is @xmath , it
follows immediately that the special form of this matrix provides with
an easy solution to the problem of representing measurements in the
mixed case. For either quadrature measurement, using the formulas above
shows that @xmath under the same evolution of the pure states case, maps
to the surface code state covariance matrix equivalent to the
zero-temperature covariance matrix times @xmath , explicitly:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is really important (before someone turns white thinking that I am
claiming topological order is resilient against temperature) to note
that this is not a thermal state for @xmath . More naively, here we are
modeling noise in the preparation of the CV surface code considering
input thermal states instead of pure states. As a result, we have a
final state that is not in thermal equilibrium, created via gaussian
operations performed on an initial thermal state.

As explained in 5.3.3 , the TMI is limited by lower and upper bounds [
178 ] . Considering divisions into regions as in Fig. ( 6.8 ), we find
that the value of the TMI is bounded by:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.68)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . The TMI for this class of mixed states is lower bounded
by the value computed for the worst-case scenario of @xmath . We then
need to calculate the corresponding lower bound for @xmath . In fact,
this value for the bound is the lowest possible bound when creating the
CV surface code state from a thermal CV cluster-state. It therefore
illustrates the maximum extent to which the TMI can sink below the TEE
for any given value of the squeezing parameter for this particular
construction of the noise model. The value of the lower bound for the
1296 modes mixed CV surface code is depicted by the circles @xmath in
Fig. ( 6.9 ).

Surprisingly, the difference between the TEE and the lowest possible
value of the TMI is very small. Intrigued by this behavior, we have
studied analytically the @xmath case and found that all the @xmath
-dependent contributions in Eq. ( 6.59 ) cancel out. As shown in
Appendix C , the TMI for @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.69)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath runs over all the regions as in Fig. ( 5.2 )a and their
complements, @xmath in accordance with the TMI formula in Eq. ( 6.59 ),
and the prime on the sum indicates that we include only the
zero-temperature symplectic eigenvalues @xmath (for each region @xmath )
for which @xmath holds. This confirms the results of our numerical
analysis.

It is worth adding a comment about our error model. This is a very
general noise model, which acts as an appropriate playground to test the
robustness of the topological phase against preparation errors.
Nevertheless, this is not the most likely source of error for a quantum
optical realization of such a scheme. Since it is not possible to
perform arbitrarily accurate quadrature measurements, a physical
motivated error model would be mixing the relevant mode with a vacuum
mode through a beam splitter having reduced transmittivity and then
perform perfect quadrature measurements. This procedure would mimic
imperfect measurements and allow for additional investigations of the
order resilience.

### 6.5 Experimental implementations for the continuous-variable surface
code

We conclude this Chapter presenting potential experimental realizations
of the CV surface code. The CV cluster-states considered in this Chapter
are canonical CV cluster-states [ 92 ] , so named because they are the
states that would result if one were to use the canonical method of
constructing them [ 198 , 46 , 47 ] . This method generates Gaussian
states with graphs of the form @xmath , where the entries of @xmath are
either 0 or 1. While this method is straightforward theoretically, the
@xmath gates are experimentally difficult and inefficient in an optical
setting, where the most progress has been made [ 190 , 201 ] .

There exist more efficient and scalable optical construction methods
although they produce cluster-states with uniform non-unit edge weight [
190 , 185 , 186 , 187 , 204 , 189 ] . By using these optical methods one
can produce medium-sized or even very large states [ 205 , 206 , 207 ] ,
including a recently demonstrated @xmath mode cluster-state with linear
topology [ 10 ] . Very large square lattices with toroidal [ 186 ] ,
cylindrical [ 92 ] and planar topology can also be made, as well as
higher-dimensional lattices [ 208 ] .

Another procedure to create similar states is by cooling a circuit-QED
system to the ground state of the Hamiltonian @xmath in Eq. ( 6.26 ) [
48 ] . It has been shown [ 49 ] that by using superconducting co-planar
waveguides coupled pairwise via dissipative Cooper pair boxes, one can
engineer an effective @xmath interaction between the microwave modes in
neighbouring waveguides. Similarly, one can also generate the @xmath
coupling by changing the location of the box in the waveguides. While
the cluster-state Hamiltonian in Eq. ( 6.26 ) also has @xmath couplings,
there exist parent Hamiltonians for CV cluster-states (up to phase
shifts) that consist only of @xmath and @xmath couplings [ 92 ] .

All of these methods can be used to efficiently produce square-lattice
CV cluster-states with uniform edge weight @xmath , with @xmath . In the
optical case, these states can be very large (thousands of modes) [ 187
] and all produce a Gaussian state with a graph of the form @xmath . It
is easy to notice that such a state can be transformed into a canonical
CV cluster-state with effective initial squeezing @xmath by squeezing
each mode in @xmath by a factor of @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.70)
  -- -------- -- --------

despite being constructed by a completely different method. Since
entanglement measures are local-unitary invariant, all of our results
apply to these states if we take @xmath . Furthermore, we do not need to
actively perform the single-mode squeezing before measuring the
TEE/TMI/TLN. We can simply rescale the outcomes of measurements on the
original @xmath -weighted) state [ 5 ] .

### 6.6 Discussion

In this Chapter we presented a model of a topologically ordered
continuous-variable surface code state, analog of the toric code,
constructed using only correlated quantum harmonic oscillators and
Gaussian operations. Besides allowing for a simple experimental
preparation, this model manifests the remarkable property that its
topological entropy @xmath can be observed simply via quadrature
measurements.

Moreover, in contrast to discrete-variable systems, the topological
entanglement entropy @xmath now is a continuous function of a physical
system parameter, specifically the initial squeezing; however, this is
not surprising since the parent Hamiltonian for the system is gapless.

It is also shown here that the CV surface code state can be prepared
beginning in a gapped CV cluster-state phase, and that the topological
phase is robust against preparation errors modeled as thermal input and
can be detected by the topological mutual information. This provides a
practical path to observe topological order in systems of interacting
bosons using technology available today.

## Chapter 7 Entropy in Polymer Quantization

### 7.1 Introduction

Entropy brings on its shoulders the weight of most of the classical and
quantum information theory [ 31 , 105 , 34 ] . Historically, entropy was
considered to have an extensive behavior, thus growing or decreasing
proportionally to the volume of the system under analysis. As a matter
of fact, the entropy of Gibbs states in statistical mechanics scale
extensively with the size of the volume of the system. On the other
hand, black hole thermodynamics [ 209 , 210 ] introduced the idea that
an upper bound on the entropy of a system (and entanglement between the
subsystems) scales with the area, and not with the volume. This idea was
later formalized as a holographic principle [ 211 ] , suggesting that a
@xmath dimensional theory can be described by a @xmath dimensional
theory that lives on the boundary of the region considered.

Such an area-law behavior has been demonstrated in a variety of
situations [ 148 ] , which include string theory and loop quantum
gravity (LQG) [ 54 , 55 ] , calculations of black hole entropy [ 209 ,
212 ] , and related models [ 213 , 177 ] . These properties seem to
suggest a deeper connection among the entropic properties of massive
objects and the behavior of correlations in entangled quantum many-body
systems.

Loop quantum gravity and the spin networks/spin foams formalisms
introduced the idea of fundamental discreteness of Nature. Investigation
of the problem of emergence of the semiclassical states of quantum
gravity and the associated mathematical issues were one of the
motivations to study a procedure known as polymer quantization of a
single non-relativistic particle [ 50 ] as a useful toy model to test
the predictions of LQG.

In this framework and considering recent advances in coupling gravity
and matter [ 65 ] in LQG, where it was necessary to re-consider
holography in these systems, one could wonder wether compatible
predictions for observables in two unitarily inequivalent quantization
schemes correspond to “close” values of the predicted entropies or not.
While the desirable answer is yes , its validity is neither obvious nor
guaranteed. The polymer quantization provides a convenient model setting
to study this problem, which becomes particularly interesting after the
results of Chapter 6 , where area laws are exploited to characterize
quantum systems.

With these questions in mind, in this Chapter it will be demonstrated
that if the Schrödinger and the polymer schemes give close (to be
precisely defined below in the sense of physical equivalence)
predictions for fundamental observables, their predictions of entropy
are also close [ 4 ] . Moreover, the two entropies coincide in the
continuum limit of the polymer quantization. We start introducing the
algebraic approach to quantum theory, which relies on the concept of
@xmath -algebras [ 214 ] . Then we describe the polymer quantization of
the Weyl algebra, pointing out its differences from the Schrödinger
quantization, before analyzing the behavior of entropy in the different
representations. Finally, the formal proof is illustrated by comparing
the ground state entanglement entropy of two coupled harmonic
oscillators in the two schemes. The task is easily accomplished using
once more the properties of Gaussian states.

### 7.2 Algebraic quantum theory

In the usual Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics, physical
observables are elements of an algebra represented as a set of operators
acting on a Hilbert space, whose unit vector elements are identified
with physical states. A different approach consists in promoting this
algebra to the fundamental object of the theory. In this sense the
physical theory is inscribed into the properties of the algebra and
quantum states are characterized independently from the representation
of the algebra of observables on the Hilbert space [ 214 ] . This
procedure was first introduced in [ 57 ] for quantum field theories
defined on a Minkowski space-time. The first step consists in assigning
to a quantum system a @xmath -algebra that implicitly describes the
relations among observables and contains all the relevant physical
structure (i.e. locality, Lorentz invariance). One then returns to the
usual Hilbert space formulation after defining quantum states via the
Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) construction [ 58 ] , which establishes a
1-to-1 correspondence (bijection) between vectors of a Hilbert space and
linear positive functionals, or states, of a @xmath -algebra.

If the algebra is the basic structure of the theory, one may ask whether
different representations of the same algebra lead to different values
of the observables. While there are theorems that relate observables in
unitarily inequivalent representations, this question raises more subtle
issues. What about quantities like entropy that are not observables? Are
they affected by the choice of a different algebra representation? And
if they are, to what extent? This is our motivation to study the
behavior of entropy in quantization schemes that are unitarily
inequivalent to the usual Schrödinger quantization.

#### 7.2.1 @xmath-algebras

Here we clarify the terminology used in the previous section. A complex
or real algebra @xmath [ 57 ] is a linear space such that, for each
@xmath , there exists an element @xmath called their product, which is
bilinear, associative and satisfy certain additional properties as
listed in [ 101 ] (these are not important for the following
discussion). Then, an algebra @xmath is a @xmath -algebra if for all
elements @xmath there exists @xmath , the adjoint of @xmath , such that
the map @xmath satisfies @xmath and @xmath . In addition, an algebra is
normed if we can associate to each element @xmath a non-negative number
@xmath called the norm of @xmath , such that @xmath if @xmath . When the
additional condition @xmath holds for all @xmath , the algebra @xmath is
a @xmath -normed algebra.

A Banach algebra is a @xmath -normed and complete algebra, where
complete means that all the Cauchy sequences of elements in the algebra,
topologically defined in terms of the distance between elements @xmath ,
converge. Finally, the set of @xmath -algebras is defined by the subset
of Banach algebras whose elements satisfy the condition @xmath and
@xmath .

In order to define the representation of an algebra, one needs to
introduce a couple of concepts more: A homomorphism is a linear mapping
between two algebras that preserves the product. If the homomorphism
also preserves the adjoint, then it is a @xmath -homomorphism. A
bijective @xmath -homomorphism is a @xmath -isomorphism between
algebras.

Finally, the representation of a given algebra @xmath is a homomorphism

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

that maps the elements of @xmath to the elements of @xmath , the algebra
of linear operators on the linear space @xmath (note, not necessarily a
Hilbert space). If the map @xmath is a isomorphism, it is called
faithful . If the only subspaces of the space @xmath invariant under the
action of @xmath are the zero element set @xmath and the space @xmath
itself, the representation is irreducible . Two representations @xmath
and @xmath , defined over the spaces @xmath and @xmath , are unitarily
equivalent if, for all @xmath , there exists a unitary transformation
@xmath such that @xmath [ 58 ] .

But what is so special about @xmath -algebra? These algebras are
interesting because, as it was proved by Gelfand and Naimark in [ 215 ]
, each (abstract) @xmath -algebra is isomorphic to the algebra @xmath of
linear bounded operators on a Hilbert space @xmath . More precisely, the
operators are bounded if for all vectors @xmath of unit norm in @xmath
one has @xmath . Therefore, if we start from a @xmath -algebra, we can
always describe the associated physical theory in the usual terms of
vectors, operators and Hilbert space, and the converse is also true. For
this reason @xmath -algebras are at the ingredients of the algebraic
description of quantum theory.

As a final remark, states on a @xmath -algebra @xmath are defined as
positive linear functionals @xmath , in the sense that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

States are normalized, i.e. @xmath , where @xmath is the identity of the
algebra. Pure states are states that cannot be written as linear
combinations of two functionals @xmath , and mixed otherwise. It is
straightforward to see that states here belong to the (positive) dual
space @xmath of the algebra (not to be confused with the set of
adjoints). The duality between states and operators is the reason why
the Heisenberg and the Schrödinger representations are equivalent
despite their apparent dichotomy ¹ ¹ 1 I am extremely pleased I managed
to use this word in the Thesis, eventually. in the description of the
evolution of the system.

#### 7.2.2 Inequivalent representations of an algebra and physical
equivalence

In the algebraic description of quantum theory, states are determined by
the expectation values of the elements of the algebra, which determine
the physical significance of the theory. Given a @xmath -algebra,
assuming there are different representations, how can one choose the
physically relevant ones or, alternatively said, those representations
that describe the same physics? This question is easy to answer in the
case of unitarily equivalent representations, since they leave the
eigenspectra of the observables invariant and therefore describe the
same physics. The problem is far less trivial when one considers
unitarily inequivalent representations, where the eigenvalues normally
differ between representations. Haag and Kastler [ 57 ] understood that
limited experimental accuracy in measurements of observables relaxes the
conditions for physical equivalence, defining new criteria that are
expressed below.

Assuming a state is described by the collection of probabilities

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

in the laboratory, the experimentalists can only extract values of the
observables correspondent to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

for the set of positive tolerances @xmath . Then, for all practical
purposes, the state @xmath is not a point of the algebra @xmath but it
is identified by a neighborhood of a point in @xmath , whose size
depends on the given tolerances. Therefore, two representations @xmath
and @xmath are physically equivalent if each state neighborhood of
@xmath contains an element of @xmath and vice-versa.

This condition of physical equivalence is equivalent to Fell’s theorem [
56 ] , which guarantees that, although two representations may be
unitarily inequivalent, it is impossible to distinguish between them by
using finite-precision expectation values of a finite number of
observables. Let us state this concept more precisely. For a state
@xmath of one of the representations, a finite set of operators @xmath
that belong to the chosen algebra @xmath and whose expectations are
calculated on that state, and the set of tolerances @xmath , then there
exists a ‘physically equivalent’ state @xmath on another representation
resulting in the expectation values that differ from the first set by
less than the prescribed tolerances. Mathematically, this corresponds to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

Unfortunately, just like Haag and Kastler’s statement, Fell’s theorem’s
proof is not constructive, therefore an explicit construction of states
and operators is needed in each case.

In the following section we first define the Weyl algebra, and then
introduce the polymer quantization, a unitarily inequivalent
representation of the Schrödinger quantization of the Weyl algebra,
which shares many similarities with the structure of loop quantum
gravity. The unitarily inequivalence of the representations will be
demonstrated using the Stone-von Neumann theorem [ 216 ] , which states
the condition for two different irreducible representations of the
canonical commutation relations to be unitarily inequivalent. In this
frame we investigate the behavior of entropy for one-dimensional quantum
systems.

### 7.3 Polymer quantization

The relevant @xmath -algebra for the following discussion is the Weyl
algebra , uniquely defined by the Weyl relation,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the unitary condition

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

The algebra elements @xmath are known as Weyl or displacement operators,
where @xmath and @xmath are the translation and boost parameters,
respectively. Generically, the Weyl operator can be expressed as a
product of the translation and boost operators, respectively @xmath and
@xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

We have already encountered these operators before, see Eq. ( 6.3 ),
when generalizing the Pauli operators to the continuous-variable
description of quantum states. In order to differentiate the contexts,
here let me stick with the traditional formalism of polymer
quantization, using @xmath and @xmath to label them.

##### Schrödinger representation of the Weyl algebra

In the standard Schrödinger representation of the Weyl algebra, the
@xmath and @xmath operators are continuous functions of the real
parameters @xmath and @xmath and are thus generated by self-adjoint
operators [ 67 ] , specifically the canonical position and momentum
operators,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

Hence, the Weyl operator is defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

and it acts on wave functions as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

There exists different representations of the Weyl algebra but,
curiously enough, the Schrödinger’s is the only representation where the
translation and boost operators are continuous functions of their
parameters and can both be written as in Eq. ( 7.9 ).

##### Polymer representation of the Weyl algebra

The polymer quantization is an alternative irreducible representation of
the Weyl algebra where quantum states are represented by countable sums
of plane waves. In this sense the polymer Hilbert space @xmath is built
around (Harald) Bohr compactification of the real line [ 52 , 217 ] . A
slightly different construction is possible [ 50 ] , defining first a
countable set of points @xmath on the real line (a ‘graph’ in the
following), and noting then that the (position) space @xmath is spanned
by the basis states @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the Kronecker’s delta, and the various bracket signs are
explained below. Countable superpositions of these basis states,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a graph and the functions @xmath satisfy certain
fall-off conditions, form a space of cylindrical functions @xmath . The
generalized infinite-dimensional space Cyl is a space of functions that
are cylindrical with respect to some graph. The Hermitian inner product
on Cyl follows from ( 7.12 ),

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

notice that the inner product is performed solely on the intersection
set of the two graphs. The Cauchy completion of Cyl is the space @xmath
, and the triplet of spaces

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is an (algebraic) dual of Cyl, shares similarities with the
construction of the physical space of LQG: However, this extends well
beyond the scope of this Thesis. Nevertheless, it is interesting to
point out that, similarly to LQG, polymer quantization is built on a
background independent Hilbert space of discrete sum of plane waves. In
LQG it is not possible to define directly the curvature of the
connection, just like the momentum operator in the polymer scheme. Other
questions regarding the topological problems are discussed in [ 50 , 218
, 219 , 220 , 221 ]

Dual elements belonging to @xmath are denoted by @xmath , and their
action on the elements of @xmath is denoted by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

The inner product defines a dual element by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

We introduce now the momentum dual states @xmath by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

hence

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the ‘position’ representation that was described so far, the operator
@xmath acts on a basis state as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

and, being weakly continuous in @xmath , it has a self-adjoint generator
@xmath that acts by multiplication and has normalized eigenstates,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

just like in Schrödinger quantization. On the other hand, the action of
the @xmath operator is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

and it is easy to see that since @xmath and @xmath are orthogonal to
each other independently from the size of the translation, the
translation operator is not weakly continuous and the momentum operator
is undefined since there is no self-adjoint operator generating @xmath .
Notice also that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

Similarly, while it is easy to show that the usual relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

holds, it does not correspond to any state of Cyl.

Clearly, a polymer momentum representation is spanned by the states
@xmath . In this case there exists a self-adjoint momentum operator with
normalizable eigenstates, but the position operator is undefined.

##### The Stone-von Neumann theorem

The relationship between the polymer and Schrödinger representation is
determined by the Stone-von Neumann theorem [ 51 ] . This theorem
asserts that: Given pairs of different irreducible representations of
the Weyl algebra @xmath on a Hilbert space, satisfying Eq. ( 7.8 ) and
weakly continuous in the parameters @xmath and @xmath , then they are
equivalent to the standard Schrödinger representation on the Hilbert
space @xmath [ 216 ] . Since the polymer representations are not weakly
continuous, they do not satisfy the conditions of the Stone-von-Neumann
theorem and thus are not unitarily equivalent to the Schrödinger
representation [ 50 , 52 ] .

##### Polymer kinematics

While a mathematically rigorous construction of the polymer states and
operators involves a multi-scale lattice [ 218 ] , for sake of
simplicity we follow an easier approach and will work with a regular
lattice @xmath , where the neighbouring points have a fixed spacing
@xmath . This means that in our discussion, for a graph @xmath , the
following

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

always holds. We have seen that a momentum operator cannot be defined in
the same way as in Schrödinger quantization. Nevertheless, it is
possible to introduce an effective momentum operator through a finite
difference of translation operators

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

The limit @xmath in Schrödinger representation gives the usual momentum
operator @xmath . Similarly, its square is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is easy to prove that these operators are self-adjoint [ 218 ] .
However, we still need to be careful when working with @xmath , because
this operator is not positive on a general space @xmath , even if it is
defined on a regular lattice. Consider for example the state (we now
drop the @xmath lower index for the position states labeling whenever is
not needed)

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

then the expectation value @xmath is given by:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (7.29)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

which is real only for a symmetric graph, i.e. when @xmath . Hence, we
restrict ourselves to such graphs.

There is another subtlety concerning this operator. From ( 7.27 ) it
follows that @xmath skips the neighboring lattice sites when acting on
states, hence its eigenfunctions can have support on either even- or
odd-numbered sites @xmath , @xmath . As a result, using @xmath as the
kinetic term for a Hamiltonian @xmath leads to a double degeneracy of
the eigenstates [ 50 , 222 , 223 ] when compared with the Schrödinger
representation. Without appealing to it, one can also note that the
state counting gives twice the semiclassical result @xmath . Depending
on one’s goals, it is possible either to adjust the state counting or to
introduce an ‘adjusted’ kinetic operator as in [ 50 ] ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

which resolves the double degeneracy.

The commutation relations between the operators are given by:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.31)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- --------

It is important to emphasize that certain modifications introduced by
the polymer quantization are a consequence of the form of the effective
momentum operator. Since it is defined using the translation operator
@xmath , it carries within a direct dependence upon the choice of the
scale of the lattice.

A key step in extracting physical predictions in the polymer
quantization is to consider certain states, called shadow states [ 53 ]
, which realize the physically equivalent state on @xmath [ 50 ] . Given
a state @xmath , a shadow state corresponding to the dual element @xmath
is constructed such that its action on @xmath is equivalent to the
scalar product between its shadow and the same state, i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

physically this means that the shadow states are projections of the
elements of @xmath onto @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using these states it is possible to explicitly demonstrate physical
indistinguishability of the predictions of the polymer and Schrödinger
quantizations, as mandated by Fell’s theorem, in the sense that the
expectation values of the observables of interest, using shadow states,
fall within a prescribed range of tolerance from the Schrödinger
predictions.

With the definition of the shadow states we concluded this short review
of all the necessary concepts for the understanding of the following
section, where we address the convergence of entropy in polymer
quantization and compare it to known results in ‘canonical’ quantum
mechanics.

### 7.4 Entropy in different quantization schemes

Our goal in this Chapter is to find a relationship between the von
Neumann entropy of a state @xmath (in the Schrödinger representation),

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

and of its polymer analogue state @xmath . There are several reasonable
ways to relate the states but, unlike the case of observables, there is
no theorem that guarantees equivalence of the entropy predictions!
Moreover, entropy is not a continuous function, and without additional
restrictions there are states of infinite entropy in a neighborhood of
any state [ 60 ] .

Throughout the following we will use certain properties of entropy as
described in Section 2.2 (see [ 60 , 74 ] for more details). The
concavity of the entropy of a convex combination of one-dimensional
projectors @xmath , with @xmath and @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

together with its upper bound

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the upper bound given by a set of density matrices @xmath weakly
convergent to the density matrix @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

Keep in mind that the relation @xmath is ensured by the weak
convergence.

It can be shown [ 60 , 224 ] that the lower semicontinuity of the
relative entropy @xmath in @xmath implies the lower semicontinuity of
the free energy @xmath at the temperature @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the Hamiltonian of the system, and the state @xmath is
not necessarily thermal.

This point is crucial for our goals: The lower semicontinuity of the
free energy has an important consequence. If in addition to the weak
convergence of the states ( 2.46 ), also the energy expectation values
converge, i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

then, from ( 7.38 ), the entropies converge as well,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now that the hypothesis have been set, we can analyze entropy in polymer
quantization. The simplest case to study in order to establish the
relationship between the state @xmath and its polymer analogue is when
the Schrödinger state

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

is a mixture of the eigenstates of some operator, and its polymer
counterpart @xmath has the corresponding eigenbasis @xmath . Then the
decomposition

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

trivially has the same entropy. In this case, it is natural to argue
that the expectation values of all the observables of interest in two
representations are close, but it should be established in the
case-by-case analysis.

Consider now the analogue

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath , the normalized ‘close approximation’ of the states @xmath
in the sense of Fell’s theorem, are mixed with the same weights. We
assume that the states @xmath are pure, but not necessarily orthogonal.

In this case, the inequality ( 7.36 ) that results from the concavity of
entropy reads as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

therefore the entropy of the state in the Schrödinger quantization
bounds the entropy of the polymer analog. This result holds for any two
representations where the equivalent state of any pure @xmath is also
pure.

A closely related result is derived as follows [ 4 ] . In the following
we will use the harmonic oscillator eigenstates both in the Schrödinger
and polymer representations, labeling the states as @xmath and @xmath ,
respectively. If the Schrödinger state is projected on the regular
lattice with spacing @xmath , resulting in @xmath , then

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

In these bases the two physically equivalent states @xmath and @xmath
can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

for some @xmath . This quantity converges to zero as to ensure the
agreement for the probabilities for projecting on the states @xmath and
their polymer analogues.

Consider now a classical Hamiltonian of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

We can test the convergence of the energy, establishing the separate
convergence of expectations of the kinetic and potential energy terms as
follows. The polymer kinetic term is given by Eq. ( 7.30 ), and is built
from the difference of two Weyl algebra operators. Hence, the direct use
of the Fell’s theorem guarantees that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

On the other hand, using Eq. ( 7.45 ) for all potentials @xmath such
that the value @xmath is finite, the projection onto the lattice and the
subsequent summation form the Riemannian sum for the above Schrödinger
integral expression. Then, for @xmath growing sub-exponentially with
@xmath we have that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

hence

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the potential in the first term refers to polymer quantization and
in the last term to Schrödinger quantization. This ensures the
convergence of the potential term.

Since both the matrix elements of the density matrices and the energy
expectation values converge, Eq. ( 7.40 ) applies and we can establish
the desired convergence

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

proving indeed that, for lattice size @xmath , the value of the entropy
in polymer quantization reduces to the same value in Schrödinger
quantization [ 4 ] .

#### 7.4.1 An example: Convergence of the entropy of two coupled
harmonic oscillators

We illustrate the result from Eq. ( 7.51 ) by considering the
entanglement of the ground state of two position-coupled harmonic
oscillators, in the simplest case of the quadratic Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the positive constant @xmath , which is bounded by @xmath ,
determines the coupling. Just like in the previous Chapters, we arrange
the position and momenta (either classical or quantum) of the @xmath
particles (in this example @xmath ) into a single @xmath -dimensional
vector @xmath and make use of the Gaussian states formalism.

In the following, the parameter that determines the closeness of the
physical predictions in the two different quantization schemes is the
ratio of the lattice size @xmath to the oscillator scale @xmath . Since
we want to model quantum geometry, we always assume that @xmath , i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the Schrödinger representation, it is very easy to calculate the
covariance matrix of the ground state of a single harmonic oscillator.
Using a covariance matrix definition physically equivalent to the one in
Eq. ( 4.14 ), but slightly different in the mathematical form to take
care of any modification induced by the polymer quantization scheme,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the anticommutator, then we are simply required to
calculate the second statistical moments of the canonical observables [
3 ] . This is an easy-to-achieve task, and using some old good
first-year calculus it is immediate to check that for the ground state
of a free quantum harmonic oscillator the following holds [ 59 ] :

  -- -- -- --------
           (7.55)
  -- -- -- --------

Recall that for a Gaussian state @xmath described by a covariance matrix
@xmath , the von Neumann entropy of any subsystem @xmath (which is still
Gaussian) is simply given by the formula of Eq. ( 4.29 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath set of the symplectic eigenvalues of the reduced covariance
matrix @xmath .

Calculations in the polymer representation are a bit trickier because
one needs to take into account the corrections due to the introduction
of the discrete spatial lattice. Let me start recalling that the wave
function of the harmonic oscillator ground state in the Schrödinger
quantization, using the @xmath representation and units where @xmath ,
is equal to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then the corresponding harmonic oscillator ground state in the polymer
quantization is described by the state

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

To extract the physical information from @xmath we use its shadow state

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

for any generic element @xmath . On an infinite regular lattice with
spacing @xmath , each point of the lattice @xmath is given by @xmath .
We assume for simplicity that the lattice is centered on @xmath , but
the discussion is equivalent for any center point. From Eq. ( 7.57 ),
the explicit form of the state @xmath is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

where now @xmath is an arbitrary normalization constant and @xmath is a
orthonormal basis on @xmath . To be pedantic, we should label the shadow
state as @xmath , but we drop the under-script @xmath when it is clear
what we are referring to. The norm of the shadow ground state is

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (7.61)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

since @xmath . To simplify this expression, we can make use of the
Poisson summation formula [ 152 , 50 ] . It states that for sufficiently
well-behaved real functions @xmath , with @xmath , the following
equality holds:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.62)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the Fourier transform @xmath of the function @xmath ,
defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.63)
  -- -------- -- --------

After rewriting Eq. ( 7.4.1 ) using Eq. ( 7.62 ), we have (with @xmath )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

The easiest way to solve this integral is by completing the square in
the exponent, i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.65)
  -- -------- -- --------

such that the right-side of Eq. ( 7.64 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the variable substitutions

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

we can immediately derive the following expression

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.68)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we exploited the well-known equality @xmath . The assumption
@xmath allows us to keep only the @xmath terms of the series, therefore
the norm of the shadow ground state is approximately equal to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.69)
  -- -------- -- --------

Calculations in the polymer representation also give zero expectations
for the ground state of the harmonic oscillator, @xmath , @xmath , but
the variances now carry modifications dependent on the lattice size
@xmath [ 50 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.70)
  -- -------- -- --------

Furthermore, the correlation terms vanish exactly

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.71)
  -- -------- -- --------

For the complete details of these calculations, the reader can refer to
Appendix D . Hence, keeping only the leading terms in @xmath the
correlation matrix for one oscillator in polymer quantization becomes:

  -- -- -- --------
           (7.72)
  -- -- -- --------

One of the consequences of the polymer quantization is that now the
product of the uncertainties is less than its standard normalized value
of @xmath , in fact:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.73)
     @xmath      (7.74)
  -- -------- -- --------

This means that the state is no longer Gaussian: The correlation matrix
violates the defining inequality @xmath , and the entropy calculated
using Eq. ( 7.56 ) becomes complex for a pure state, explicitly @xmath .

Going back to the coupled oscillators, to quantify the amount of
entanglement among them we use again the von Neumann entropy of either
of the reduced density matrices. It was shown in the example ( 4.2.2 )
at the end of Chapter 4 how to calculate the von Neumann entropy of two
coupled oscillators transforming the system to the normal modes by means
of a symplectic transformation. This gives two uncoupled oscillators
with new frequencies @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.75)
  -- -------- -- --------

The (Schröedinger) correlation matrix in the normal coordinates is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.76)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the only symplectic eigenvalue of the reduced correlation matrix is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.77)
  -- -------- -- --------

The polymer quantization is treated similarly. As it is done in the
usual quantization process, one needs to perform the symplectic
transformation before quantizing (á la polymer), since these two
procedures do not commute. Using @xmath and similarly to Eq. ( 4.50 ),
the covariance matrix of the two uncoupled oscillators in polymer
quantization looks like:

  -- -- -- --------
           (7.78)
  -- -- -- --------

The original covariance matrix can be reconstructed using the (inverse
of the) appropriate symplectic transformation @xmath described in Eq. (
4.48 ). Then we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
                 (7.79)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the reduced covariance matrix for either the first or second
oscillator is simply

  -- -- -- --------
           (7.80)
  -- -- -- --------

Keeping only the leading terms in the powers of @xmath , the symplectic
eigenvalue determining the bipartite entanglement in the polymer
quantization is

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (7.81)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

and the von Neumann entropy, calculated using @xmath into Eq. ( 7.56 )
is equal to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.82)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath von Neumann entropy in the Schrödinger quantization, in
agreement with the results about entropy derived in previous sections of
this Chapter [ 3 ] .

### 7.5 Discussion

The main result in this Chapter is the derivation of a general bound
that relates entropies of physically equivalent states in unitarily
inequivalent representations of the Weyl-Heisenberg algebra. In
particular, we proved that the entropies of two states described in the
Schrödinger and the polymer quantizations agree.

The lattice effects modify the expectation values of physical
observables, the commutation relations and the entropy values such that
shadow states of semi-classical states do not satisfy the Gaussian
property exactly, but only up to the terms of the order of @xmath . The
results derived here give also physical justification to the entropy
corrections derived by Chacon-Acosta et al. [ 225 ] for the statistical
thermodynamic properties of one-dimensional polymer quantum systems.

Since the convergence of entropy of the shadow states to the Schrödinger
representation value is not necessarily uniform, the following scenario
is plausible. Remember that both the discrepancy in the expectation
value of the momentum variances and symplectic eigenvalues are of the
order of @xmath for each (uncoupled) oscillator. We showed that this is
also the order of magnitude of the corresponding change in entropy
contribution if the formula ( 7.56 ) is used. Therefore, even if the
expectations of the observables agree, for a fixed value of @xmath and a
large number @xmath of oscillators the two entropies will differ by
@xmath , which may be a significant amount. We leave this as an open
question.

## Chapter 8 Conclusions

In this Thesis we investigated the interplay of geometry and quantum
information in various physical situations. In the first part we looked
at the effects of gravity on photon polarization, identifying paths that
induce a gauge-invariant phase of the photon state. In the second part
we studied topological order in the context of continuous-variable
systems. While the first two parts of this work are driven by the effort
of simplifying the experimental realizations of certain quantum
information tasks, the third part is mainly theoretical and deals with
the problem of entropy in different quantization schemes. In this
conclusive Chapter we review the results obtained in each part of the
Thesis and wind up this work by tickling the reader’s attention with a
list of open questions.

### 8.1 Relativistic quantum information

Quantum information tasks in space rely on the sapient use of reference
frames to make the processing of information meaningful.

In Chapter 3 we dealt with this problem, describing the effects of
gravity on photon polarization. We investigated the possibility to
design particular paths of propagation along which the polarization
phase accrued is gauge-invariant, i.e. independent of the choice of
reference frame in the course of the trajectory. We first focused on the
spatial three-dimensional projection of a general four-dimensional
space-time, which is an excellent approximation of the near-Earth
environment. After deriving an equation for the phase polarization in
terms of the geometrical properties of the underlying spatial manifold,
in section 3.2.1 we showed that along a closed path that phase is
invariant under a change in the polarization reference frame.

Interestingly enough, the same argument can be extended to general
four-dimensional space-times. Constructing a closed path by means of
mirrors carefully posed, we proved that the total variation in the
polarization of two photons moving along the two paths of a closed
trajectory that resembles a Mach-Zender interferometer, depends again
solely on the geometrical bundle curvature enclosed by the curve.

Gauge-independence of the phase bypasses the problem of having to
communicate reference frames between observers at the two ends of a
trajectory, simplifying for instance the setup of an experiment aimed at
testing the relativistic effects of gravity on quantum systems. We
discussed this and other related experimental proposals at the end of
Chapter 3 in section 3.3 .

### 8.2 Continuous-variable topological order and Gaussian states

Topologically ordered systems are the platforms for implementing stable
quantum memories or universal quantum computers. However, topological
phases are usually associated with discrete-variable systems, which are
extremely challenging to prepare and control in the laboratory. Here we
extended this concept to continuous-variables, proving that it is indeed
possible to detect topological order on a lattice of interacting quantum
harmonic oscillators, which is based on two-body interactions and offers
an easier experimental implementation.

In Chapter 6 we describe the properties of the physical
continuous-variable surface code state, analog of Kitaev’s surface
codes, identifying the appropriate form of the stabilizer set in 6.3.2
and using them to construct the defining Hamiltonian, whose ground state
determines the code state.

Although the parent Hamiltonian of our surface code model is gapless (
6.3.2 ), which might affect the topological stability, we proved that
the entropy on the lattice follows an area law. Besides, we provided
with an analytical proof of the exponential decay of the correlations in
the system. In section 6.4.2 we showed that the momentum-momentum
correlations are finite, and the momentum-position correlations are
zero. Then, the position-position correlations are completely determined
by the inverse of a matrix @xmath that is proportional to the adjacency
matrix with self loops for the graph describing the surface code state.
The matrix @xmath is banded block-diagonal, positive and has bounded
spectrum, which means that the position-position correlations decay
exponentially. We also derived an upper bound on the correlations.

A prominent feature of our model, made evident in the numerics presented
in Fig. ( 6.7 ), section 6.4.3 , is that the topological order can be
verified via quadrature measurements on the state. Moreover, errors in
state preparation modeled as thermal inputs do not affect the size of
the topological order as adequately quantified by the topological mutual
information, see Fig. ( 6.9 ). If an experiment were to follow our
protocol, even for highly mixed states, the output surface code would
have topological mutual information only slightly lower than the pure
state case. This means the order in the state is well protected against
local errors during preparation, as it should be.

Continuous-variable surface codes have not received proper attention in
the literature, and when they did, it was done under the unphysical case
of infinite squeezing. The results we derived here open up new
possibilities for topologically protected operations with continuous
degrees of freedom. Given the tremendous advance in technologies to
construct large-scale continuous-variable cluster-states, as described
in 6.5 , we expect that this will motivate further progress in this
direction.

### 8.3 Entropy in polymer quantization

Loop quantum gravity is a background-independent theory that attempts to
find a solution to the problem of the quantization of gravity. The basic
feature of the theory is quantum geometry, and the fundamental spatial
discreteness is one of its predictions.

Polymer quantization provides a simple mathematical setup in a purely
quantum mechanical context to investigate different aspects of loop
quantum gravity, such as the emergence of semiclassical states of
quantum gravity. Similarly to loop quantum gravity, in the polymer
quantization of a usual non-relativistic system there is a
well-specified position operator with exact eigenstates, but no momentum
operator – only an effective analog that acts as a translation operator
on the underlying lattice. In this sense polymer quantization is
different from the canonical Schrödinger quantization of the
Weyl-Heisenberg algebra.

Motivated by the absence of a conceptual analysis of entropy across
different quantizations, in Chapter 7 we studied the relation between
the value of the quantum entropy in polymer and Schrödinger quantization
schemes. While the two theories are physically equivalent in terms of
physical observables, whose closeness of the values is ensured by Fell’s
theorem, we were interested in investigating eventual discrepancy
between the values of the entropy. In 7.4 we proved that for mixture of
pure states, the entropy of the state in the Schrödinger quantization is
a general bound for the polymer analog.

Moreover, exploiting the continuity properties of the entropy, we showed
the convergence of the value of the polymer entropy to the canonical
Schrödinger one in the limit of lattice size going to zero.

To conclude this analysis, in 7.4.1 we examined the case of two coupled
harmonic oscillators quantized in the polymer sense. We derived the
covariance matrix of the ground state and showed the form of the
corrections induced by the discreteness of the space. These corrections
are propagated to the value of the entanglement entropy of any of the
two oscillators, reducing it by a series of terms proportional to the
lattice size: This confirmed our theoretical predictions.

### 8.4 Open Problems:

-   An important extension of our work on photonic qubit probes of
    space-time curvature is the analysis of gravitational effects on
    massive spin @xmath particles. This is a particular cumbersome task,
    since in this case we have to take care of the coupling between spin
    and momentum explicitly, without having the advantage of classical
    analysis. While these effects have been studied under Lorentz
    transformations, an extension to account for general relativistic
    effects is wanting.

-   We still do not have a complete mathematical characterization of the
    continuous-variable surface code state in terms of the quantum
    double of a continuous group, for example the @xmath group. It would
    be fascinating to establish a connection between CV topological
    phases and gauge theories, in analogy to generalized Kitaev’s
    surface codes and discrete gauge theories.

-   An interesting open question is whether it is possible to perform
    local error correction following errors in the preparation of the
    state, analogous to what is done for toric codes, for example by
    local measurements of the hermitian quadratic form of the
    nullifiers.

-   One could study whether it is possible to utilize the toroidal
    version of this model to store quantum information, in analogy with
    the qudit-version of the toric code, and additionally investigating
    how the string-net operators introduced in [ 5 ] would affect such
    information.

-   Further investigations involve the existence of a meaningful
    correspondence between the entanglement spectrum on a cut of the CV
    surface code and a thermal state of a boundary Hamiltonian, as shown
    for the discrete case in [ 226 ] .

-   A future expansion of the work related to the study of entropy in
    polymer quantization involves the precise estimation of the
    discrepancy in entropies for a fixed lattice scale and systems
    composed of a large number of particles. In fact, while the polymer
    correction for a single oscillator is too small to be observed in an
    experiment, it might be that for a large number of particles the
    discrepancy grows and becomes significantly large.

## Appendix A Elements of Differential Geometry

In this Appendix we review the basic concepts of differential geometry
that are used in the main text of this Thesis, in particular throughout
Chapter 3 . As a comment for the students or the interested readers,
this short set of notes is mainly based on the book by Baez and Muniain
[ 101 ] , in our opinion one of the clearest books on the subject.

### a.1 Manifolds

Physics does not happen on white sheets of paper, it has to happen
somewhere physical . The conceptual abstraction where the modern field
theories of physics, and in particular General relativity, come to life
is a space-time. The mathematical description of our space-time is given
by a pair ( @xmath , @xmath ), with @xmath a smooth 4-dimensional
manifold and @xmath a metric. Physically, each point of @xmath is an
event and the metric is used to calculate the distance (in a manifold
sense) between events. Physical processes are intended as continuous
lines connecting events over a manifold. It is always possible to assign
a set of coordinates to the events, and indeed necessary when dealing
with applied physics. But different observers may assign different
reference frames to the same physical events. How can they communicate
their findings if they are speaking seemingly different languages? This
is where differential geometry comes to help.

Differential geometry contains the set of rules necessary to expand
Euclidean geometry to any general space-time (or manifold). The
underlying physical idea is that the laws of physics can be rewritten in
a form independent of any choice of coordinates or reference frame or,
more specifically, the laws of physics are covariant.

Therefore, the mathematical stage where physics takes place is a
manifold. Without worrying too much about the rather technical
mathematical properties, let us define a @xmath -dimensional smooth
manifold as a (topological) space that can be covered by open sets
@xmath that locally look like the Euclidean space @xmath . Furthermore,
there must exist continuous functions @xmath such that @xmath and each
transition function @xmath , defined over the overlap of two such sets
@xmath , is smooth, or infinitely differentiable. Each pair @xmath is
called a chart . The collection of these charts is an atlas and
Einstein’s principle of general covariance states that all observers
must observe the same physics independently of their choice of atlas.

### a.2 Calculus on manifolds

Since we are not dealing with physics defined on the usual @xmath spaces
anymore, we need to extend the calculus elements to manifolds. For the
sake of this Thesis, there is no need to define each and every concept
of differential geometry, but we will clarify the meaning of the
entities used in Chapter 3 to describe the gauge-invariance of the
polarization in closed paths. These entities are vector fields ,
differential forms , sections of fiber-bundles and the functions of
these sections, familiarly known as connections .

#### a.2.1 Vector fields

To define vector fields we need to introduce the concept of real scalar
function on a smooth manifold. This is a function that takes a point in
@xmath and assigns to it a real number, namely

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

Locally on a chart @xmath , @xmath looks like

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

We can only define the mathematical properties of a function for its
local description; For @xmath patches covering the manifold, there will
be @xmath local description of @xmath . If each of these functions is
(locally) smooth, i.e. @xmath , and one can glue them together using the
charts transition function for each overlapping @xmath , @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

then we say that @xmath itself is infinitely-differentiable and @xmath .

Vector fields are the generalization of the derivative for manifolds.
Specifically, a vector field @xmath on @xmath is a linear function
acting on @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

which also satisfies the Leibniz rule @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

We name the space of all vector fields @xmath . Things can be easily
understood when the manifold is @xmath . Then we can use the usual
cartesian coordinates @xmath to label events and for a function @xmath ,
a vector field looks like

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath are the components of the field and the elements @xmath
form a basis for every vector field on @xmath .

##### Tangent vector fields

Take a point @xmath , for @xmath a @xmath -dimensional manifold. Then,
intuitively, a small neighborhood of the point can be considered locally
equivalent to @xmath , just like a soccer field on the Earth is
practically equivalent to a flat 2-dimensional plane.

A curve on @xmath is a continuous smooth map from some interval in
@xmath to @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

Fixing @xmath , one can see that each vector in @xmath , the local
representation of the neighborhood of @xmath , determines the directions
a curve can depart from @xmath . Then a tangent vector in @xmath is a
map that takes a function and gives a real number

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

or, given some curve @xmath , where @xmath then

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

We therefore define tangent space @xmath at @xmath as the vector space
of all the tangent vectors @xmath . By construction the space @xmath is
isomorphic to @xmath .

Now consider a chart @xmath such that the point @xmath has local
coordinates @xmath . Let us explain the difference between having the
coordinates index @xmath on the top @xmath or the bottom @xmath of a
symbol. Assume the vector field basis is @xmath , then every @xmath can
be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we call @xmath the vector components in @xmath of the tangent
vector @xmath . If we describe the same point from another chart @xmath
, with @xmath , then the same vector is written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath , and the two basis must be related by some linear
transformation @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

From this, it immediately follows that there exists a transformation
rule for the two sets of components, explicitly given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

Any vector @xmath that transforms in such a way is a contravariant
vector . Hence, the components of a tangent vector are said to be
contravariant and they deserve an index up @xmath .

#### a.2.2 Differential forms

One of the goals of differential geometry is to extend the concepts of
differential calculus as gradient, cross product, and such to the
coordinate-free manifolds world. The technical entities that allow us to
do so are known as differential forms , together with their calculus
rules. A differential form is some mathematical beast that belongs to
the Algebra @xmath , a vector space with more special properties,
defined over @xmath and generated by the elements of the sub-algebra
@xmath . We are aware this may sound very confusing, so let us try to
explain better this concepts in a concise but precise way. Please keep
in mind that our intention here is not generalising differential
calculus, but rather defining what differential forms are, in order to
clarify our findings in the main body of this Thesis.

##### Cotangent vector fields: The 1-forms.

Take @xmath as our reference manifold with global chart coordinates
@xmath : then @xmath .. are functions @xmath and @xmath generic elements
of @xmath , the vector space in @xmath with basis @xmath . We then
introduce a new object @xmath , call it 1-form and define it as a map

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

So a 1-form is something that takes a vector field @xmath and produces a
function instead, i.e. @xmath . It is created by acting with the
exterior derivative on any function @xmath , where @xmath , and @xmath
is the algebra of 1-forms on the manifold @xmath . It easily follows
that in this special case,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

and @xmath is a basis for @xmath . For @xmath the basis generalizes to
@xmath and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

Thus, in the comfort of @xmath , @xmath reduces to the well-known total
differential of a function. Generalizing now to a manifold @xmath , we
say that @xmath is a 1-form (or a covector field) satisfying

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath space of all 1-forms on @xmath . Note that on a coordinate
chart, a 1-form can be expressed as a linear combination of the
coordinate differentials

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

Consider again the usual point @xmath ; It is always possible to
construct a vector space @xmath of cotangent vectors @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

The equations above explain the concept of duality . We say that on
@xmath the basis @xmath is a 1-form basis dual to @xmath . On the qubit
Hilbert space @xmath , the kets @xmath span the space @xmath and the
bras @xmath span @xmath , where @xmath is the centre of the Bloch’s
sphere.

From Eq.( A.18 ) we see that the components of a 1-form carry a lower
index. Why is that? By considering again two charts describing @xmath
with coordinates @xmath and @xmath , one can prove that the
transformation rule for the @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

For this reason, the components @xmath of @xmath form a covariant vector
, and their transformation rule is the inverse of the one for
contravariant vectors Eq.( A.13 ).

##### 2-forms, 3-forms.. n-forms

For a manifold @xmath with 1-form space @xmath and dimension @xmath , it
is possible to build 2-forms, 3-forms and so on up to n-forms starting
from the 1-forms. Defining the @xmath symbol, which combines two 1-forms
and satisfies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

for a local chart @xmath and @xmath , a n-form space @xmath is the
exterior algebra ¹ ¹ 1 An exterior algebra is an algebra equipped with
the anti-commutative property from Eq.( A.21 ). of n-forms

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath . It follows that the total space of the differential forms
is the algebra over @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

### a.3 The metric

The concept of distance between two points of a manifold, or rather two
events in a space-time, is summarized by the concept of a metric . For a
vector space @xmath , a metric @xmath is a map that takes two vectors in
@xmath and produces a real number

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

For a manifold, a metric determines at every point @xmath a local metric
@xmath that defines an inner product for the tangent space @xmath . The
easiest example for a metric is the Minkowski metric ² ² 2 We do not
discuss here the problem of the signature of a metric, but simply adopt
the usual convention @xmath . @xmath , globally defined for a Minkowski
space-time:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

The quantity above defines an interval in such a space-time. More
generally, an interval is locally defined in terms of the differential
of the coordinates as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the elements @xmath are the components of the metric @xmath . For
our purposes, given a four-dimensional manifold @xmath , a generic
interval, and therefore its metric @xmath , can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a scalar, @xmath is a three-dimensional vector with
components @xmath and @xmath determines the metric of the
three-dimensional static space @xmath that can be assigned to each point
of @xmath and described by the Landau-Lifshitz @xmath formalism [ 115 ]
.

For the definition-lovers, we call a manifold Riemannian [ 110 ] iff
@xmath at each point of the manifold. In the most general case, the
manifold is pseudo-Riemannian, which simply means that it comes equipped
with a non-degenerate metric (i.e. @xmath for all @xmath only if @xmath
). The space-times used in relativity (and the Minkowski space-time as a
special case) are Lorentzian manifolds, a subset of the
pseudo-Riemannian that exhibits a special form of the metric signature [
101 ] .

### a.4 Fiber bundles

Modern field theories are expressed in terms of sections and connections
on fiber bundles . These concepts are also central in general relativity
and for that reason we are going to deal with them now. The main idea is
the following.

Consider a manifold @xmath , a base manifold of dimensions @xmath
corresponding to a physical space-time, and a second manifold @xmath ,
the total manifold with dimensions @xmath . Then take a continuous and
non-invertible map

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

which projects the total manifold to the base manifold. We then
associate a sub-manifold @xmath of dimension @xmath to each point @xmath
, composed of all those points that are projected into @xmath by the map
@xmath . We name this sub-manifold the fibre over @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

For example, we can think of the tangent space @xmath as a fiber over
@xmath and thus the total manifold will be the tangent bundle of all the
tangent spaces of each point in our space-time. It is important to
understand the point here: Locally, for a chart @xmath of @xmath , the
sub-manifold @xmath is homeomorphic ³ ³ 3 An homeomorphism is the
equivalent of isomorphism for manifolds. to the manifold produced by the
direct product of the chart itself and the standard fibre @xmath with
@xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

If this condition is always satisfied, then we say that the bundle
@xmath is locally trivial.

We can make things easier, assuming that the standard fiber @xmath is a
n-dimensional vector space. Then we call the bundle @xmath , with @xmath
, a n-dimensional real vector bundle .

##### Bundle sections

Given a bundle @xmath , a section is a map @xmath that associates to
each point @xmath of the base manifold a point @xmath in the fiber above
@xmath , i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

Intuitively, a section is the projection of a path from the base
manifold to the fibers above the points of the base path. The set of all
sections is denoted by @xmath and locally we can always define a basis
@xmath such that each section on a patch is given by @xmath with @xmath
.

In modern physics, sections of certain special bundles represent fields
and are used to describe the different interactions in Nature. Such
bundles are vector bundles called G-bundles , where @xmath is a Lie
group [ 67 ] . For a @xmath -bundle, the standard fiber is a vector
space @xmath where the group @xmath has a representation @xmath . This
allows to study the symmetrical properties of the sections of a @xmath
-bundle, which are determined by gauge transformations of the sections.
With some mathematical freedom, we define a gauge transformation as a
linear map @xmath that acts over the set @xmath with @xmath some @xmath
-bundle

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

and @xmath element of the gauge group @xmath for any @xmath . In the
main text, we apply these concepts showing the gauge invariance of the
photon polarization under rotation of the polarization axis in closed
curves.

##### Connection and curvature

The problem that arises almost immediately after introducing the
sections, is how to describe the variation of a section, since it
crosses different vector fields at different points. It should be clear
from the previous discussion that a section is nothing else but a vector
field defined on the base manifold! Therefore its variation corresponds
to calculating the derivative of a vector field at two different points,
each described by two different patches and set of coordinates. How can
we connect these descriptions together? Through the introduction of the
covariant derivative of a vector field.

Consider a point @xmath over a manifold @xmath , whose neighborhood is
covered by the chart @xmath with local coordinate frame @xmath . Then,
the covariant derivative in the direction @xmath of a vector field
@xmath , locally defined around @xmath , whit @xmath tangent vector in
@xmath , is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

The @xmath are called Ricci coefficients or the coefficients of the
affine connection . For a local vector field basis @xmath , these
coefficients are defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

The theory of general relativity is torsion free . This means that a
specific quantity, the torsion tensor @xmath , is equal to zero

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

which implies the symmetry of the connection’s coefficients:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

Note that it is always possible, given a chart with a local vector field
basis @xmath and a dual 1-form basis @xmath , to build a local matrix of
connection 1-forms as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the covariant derivative one can define the meaning of a geodesic
and parallel transport . Take a curve @xmath on a manifold @xmath ,
where @xmath is an affine parameter that describes the curve, then a
vector @xmath is parallel transported along @xmath iff

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

When this condition is satisfied, the curve @xmath is a geodesic.

A curved space-time is characterized by a quantity that captures the
difference from a flat space-time. This is called, unsurprisingly,
intrinsic curvature and it is described by a local matrix of curvature
2-forms

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

While we are not interested in explicitly showing the mathematical
derivation of the formula above, the analogy between Eq.( A.39 ) and the
notion of intrinsic curvature is given by the coefficients expansion of
@xmath in terms of some local 2-forms basis @xmath , i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

When the local vector field basis is @xmath , then the coefficient
@xmath is the Riemann curvature tensor, a quantity that only depends on
the metric of the manifold and, in this sense, a fully intrinsic
property of the space-time.

## Appendix B Nullifiers transformations

Here we present details of the derivation of the nullifier sets for the
continuous-variable cluster state and surface code, both in the ideal
and physical case.

### b.1 Ideal continuous-variable cluster state

In the ideal case of @xmath free quantum harmonic oscillators the
initial global state is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the ground state of the quantum harmonic oscillator, or
the vacuum state, and @xmath is the zero-eigenstate of the operator
@xmath . This state is nullified by the collection of operators @xmath .
To study the evolution of the nullifiers after the application of the
controlled- @xmath gates

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

we really only need to calculate the transformation:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

This is easily done by defining

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

Hence, the derivation over the evolution parameter is:

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (B.5)
              @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Since @xmath and @xmath , for @xmath one finds that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

Additional controlled- @xmath gates applied between the mode @xmath and
its neighboring sites repetitively add the corresponding @xmath factor
since

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

for the obvious commutativity of the operators. Therefore, on a square
lattice the new set of nullifiers for the @xmath state is equal to
@xmath with

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

#### b.1.1 Spectrum of the @xmath Hamiltonian

To prove that the Hamiltonian whose ground state is the ideal CV cluster
state

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

is gapless, we consider the case where all but one qumode states are
initialized to @xmath . Then the initial global state is equal to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath with @xmath and the label @xmath is chosen for simplicity.
After the application of the controlled- @xmath gates, the resulting
state

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

fails to satisfy the nullifier condition imposed by the element @xmath
and corresponds to an excited state of @xmath . The parameter @xmath
determines the distance of @xmath from the ground state @xmath . Then,
using the relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

one can calculate

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

Hence, it immediately follows that @xmath is indeed an eigenstate of
@xmath with eigenvalue

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

and this confirms that the Hamiltonian @xmath is critical in the limit
of infinite squeezing.

### b.2 Physical continuous-variable cluster state

For the finitely squeezed cluster state the approach is similar. The
only difference lies in the initial state, which is now given by a
collection of momentum-squeezed states,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since the operators @xmath do not nullify this state anymore, one has to
start from the very initial nullifier set of (dimensionless)
annihilation operators @xmath . Then, following the same reasoning as
before, the nullifier set @xmath for the cluster state derives from

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (B.16)
              @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

and a generic element of the set is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

### b.3 Ideal continuous-variable surface code

The derivation of the nullifier set for the CV surface code requires
more attention and implies knowledge of the nullifiers transformation
rules under quadrature measurements, which we are going to review
briefly here.

The explicit form of the surface code nullifiers for a square lattice
(while allowing for smooth or open boundaries) are obtained by taking
linear combination of neighboring nullifiers of the CV cluster state. A
quadrature measurement on a qumode removes it from the cluster [ 47 ] .
Given a set of exact nullifiers for a Gaussian state [ 92 ] , one can
obtain new nullifiers by a three-step process [ 5 ] :

-   Given a quadrature measurement @xmath to be made on mode @xmath ,
    where @xmath , using linear combinations of the original nullifiers,
    write a new set of nullifiers (remember, they need to commute) such
    that the canonically conjugate local quadrature @xmath (where @xmath
    appears only in one nullifier in the new set.

-   In each new nullifier, replace @xmath with the real-valued
    measurement outcome.

-   Eliminate the nullifier that contains @xmath .

We always assume that the outcome of the measurement is zero because any
other outcome would merely result in the same state up to displacements
in phase space. These displacements can always be undone by local
unitaries and therefore do not change any entanglement measure we might
want to calculate [ 3 ] , as explained in 4.1 .

As an example consider the simplest case of the square @xmath ideal CV
cluster state, with the vertices labeled from 1 to 9, row by row. The
initial nullifier set is @xmath for @xmath from Eq. ( B.8 ). We follow
the measurement scheme [ 188 ] illustrated in Fig ( 6.1 ) and start
performing the measurement @xmath .

Step one of the process described above makes us note that both @xmath
and @xmath contain the canonical conjugate @xmath . Thus, we substitute
@xmath with the linear combination @xmath and leave @xmath as it is. We
then jump to step two and substitute @xmath with its (zero) measurement
outcome, de facto replacing @xmath . Finally, we remove @xmath from the
set, and obtain the nullifier set for the post-measurement state:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

This procedure, while tedious, can be efficiently repeated for the other
measurements. After measuring @xmath one is left with the new set:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

The @xmath measurement simply disconnects the node from the cluster and
we are left with:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

To save some ink, we collapse measurement @xmath and @xmath into one
line and the final set of nullifiers is:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

The form of the nullifiers in this case, expressed by the signs in the
linear combinations, corresponds to the special case of a square lattice
with counterclockwise face orientation and all edges pointing toward or
away from the vertices, alternatively. For a square lattice with generic
orientation, the construction just described tells us that the CV ideal
cluster state nullifiers are:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.22)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath if the edge @xmath is oriented with @xmath or against
@xmath the face @xmath . A more general expression that holds for any
kind of lattice is given in the main text in 6.2.2 and it is based on
the same derivation presented here.

### b.4 The physical continuous-variable surface code

For the physical CV surface code the procedure to follow is the same of
the precedent case, but more elaborate. To obtain the face nullifiers
@xmath , one sums the cluster state nullifiers immediately adjacent to
the @xmath -measured mode (along the cardinal directions) with
orientation-dependent signs (e.g. @xmath ). The vertex nullifiers @xmath
are more complex and require next-nearest-neighbor nullifiers to be
added to the sum of neighboring nullifiers around the @xmath -measured
mode in order to achieve step one in the procedure above. Then, the
general form of the CV surface code nullifiers for a generic lattice
with possibly incomplete vertices and faces is [ 5 , 191 ]

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.23)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

with @xmath , @xmath valence of vertex @xmath and @xmath boundary size
of the lattice face. It is important to realize that now there is a
dependence upon the position on the lattice of the vertex or face that
we consider. The form of the commutation relations for these nullifiers
is not as straightforward as in the previous cases. They are determined
by the distance between the vertices and the boundary size of the faces
as [ 5 ]

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (B.24)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Now @xmath is the Euclidean distance between the two vertices @xmath and
@xmath , where the edge lengths of the graph are unit length. Then the
most generic CV physical surface code Hamiltonian is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the squeezing dependence of the prefactors for the vertex and face
parts ensures the Hamiltonian has finite energy in the infinitely
squeezed limit:

  -- -- -- --------
           (B.26)
  -- -- -- --------

Here we used the fact that for infinite squeezing, each vertex nullifier
involves a sum of @xmath ’s around that vertex and its four neighboring
vertices, and since they all commute, the parent Hamiltonian is simply
the squared sum of @xmath ’s around each vertex.

## Appendix C Entropy bounds

In Chapter 6 we have shown how to calculate the topological entanglement
entropy (TEE) @xmath and the topological mutual information (TMI) @xmath
for the finitely squeezed continuous-variable (CV) surface code. In this
Appendix we first compute an upper bound to the TEE, calculating the
subsystem entropy of a simpler network of entangled modes and then,
analyzing the structure of the contributions to the TMI in the limit of
high temperature noisy input states, we derive a lower bound to the TMI.

### c.1 Topological entanglement entropy upper bound

To derive the TEE upper bound, we invoke the calculation of subsystem
entropy appropriate to stabilizer states, which have vanishing two-point
correlation functions. Consider stabilizer states that are quantum
doubles of a finite group @xmath (such as the toric code, the quantum
double of @xmath ) as explained in Chapter 5 . As shown in [ 40 ] , the
TEE is calculated by dividing the system into two subsystems @xmath and
identifying the redundant gauge transformations defined on the boundary
between the two regions. Then the entanglement entropy of subsystem
@xmath is the logarithm of the number of the (all equivalent) Schmidt
coefficients of the state. Exploiting the group properties of @xmath
allows one to write the entropy as @xmath , implying the TEE is @xmath .

For the CV surface codes (or for CV systems in general), it is
complicated ¹ ¹ 1 For the interested researchers: Maybe impossible? to
extract an analogous exact expression for the entropy of a subsystem
because the Schmidt coefficients are not all equal as in the discrete
case. Furthermore, the TEE is infinite for infinitely squeezed (ideal)
CV surface code states, and the definition of quantum dimensions is not
so clear for finitely squeezed CV surface code states since we do not
yet have a description of this model in terms of the quantum double of a
group. Nevertheless we can go ahead and compute the subsystem entropy in
the same way that would be done for the discrete case and treat this as
a bound for the TEE of the CV surface code state. It is simply an upper
bound because we are ignoring longer-range correlations that degrade the
topological order, but since the correlations length is bounded for any
finite amount of squeezing, this should be a reasonable tight bound.

A simple configuration to start with is a quantum double model with a
discrete group on a lattice with two faces. This can be realized using a
graph with just three edges (that correspond to physical modes) and two
vertices, as shown in Figs.( C.1 a,b). For the toric code, the ground
state of such a configuration would be the GHZ [ 227 , 228 ] state
@xmath since both vertices implement the stabilizer @xmath , and one
face enforces @xmath , while the other face enforces @xmath .

Identifying two qubits on one of the faces with subsystem @xmath , the
subsystem entropy is @xmath , where 2 comes from the size of the
boundary of region @xmath and therefore @xmath . There is a simple way
to obtain this simplified surface code network of three modes from a
finitely squeezed CV cluster state with six modes, after measuring out
three of the modes (Fig.( C.1 c,d)). The resultant CV network has a
correlation matrix that can be computed exactly, following the method
explained in Chapter 6 . The symplectic spectrum for the single-mode
subsystem @xmath , complement of @xmath , has two symplectic eigenvalues
@xmath ( 4.1.1 ) with

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

thus, using the formula in Eq.( 4.29 ), the entanglement entropy @xmath
is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the upper bound for the TEE can be expressed as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

### c.2 Surface code topological mutual information from
high-temperature cluster-states

In 6.4.4 we introduced a noise model for the CV surface code state,
modeling a CV cluster state at thermal equilibrium with an environment
at temperature @xmath and preparing the CV surface code by quadrature
measurements on the mixed CV cluster state. Here we derive a lower bound
for the topological mutual information (TMI) of this (noisy) CV surface
code state, analyzing the limit @xmath (with @xmath , @xmath gap of the
CV physical cluster state), which corresponds to the strongest possible
decrease of the TMI from the TEE for the noise model considered.

Recall that for a reduction @xmath of a pure state @xmath , the von
Neumann entropy @xmath determines the entanglement entropy of the
subsystem with respect to its complement. We should know by now that for
Gaussian states one can use the formula

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the collection of @xmath symplectic eigenvalues
associated to the reduced covariance matrix @xmath of the subsystem
@xmath . About the notation (proudly invented by the author of this
Thesis), in the following @xmath indicates the total number of
symplectic eigenvalues @xmath associated to a region @xmath , @xmath
indicates the number of symplectic eigenvalues @xmath , and @xmath
denotes those @xmath .

Since the normal-mode energies of the thermalized CV cluster state
Hamiltonian we are considering are all equal, this is physically
equivalent to squeezing identical thermal single-mode states (still
defined by the parameter @xmath ) instead of vacuum states in the
canonical construction procedure as explained in Chapter 6 . To detect
the topological order of the resulting mixed CV surface code state, we
use the TMI ( 5.3.3 ):

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath mutual information for a subsystem @xmath .

The numerical simulations show that the TMI does not decrease
significantly with an increment of the initial value of @xmath . This is
interesting and rather unintuitive since we expected that higher
temperature of the initial states would quickly kill the value of the
TMI, hence an analytical expression is required to confirm our findings.

First of all, recall that the covariance matrix @xmath of the resulting
mixed CV surface code state is equivalent to the “pure” one ( @xmath )
times @xmath , mathematically

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

As a consequence, the symplectic eigenvalues of @xmath (or any reduced
section of it) are simply given by the pure symplectic eigenvalues
multiplied by the overall @xmath factor, @xmath . This simple
transformation of @xmath is a special case that only arises due to the
fact that all normal modes of the CV cluster state Hamiltonian are
identical, resulting in equal symplectic eigenvalues @xmath .

For a large value of @xmath , we find the following asymptotic
expression for each eigenvalue contribution to Eq.( C.4 ):

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We can use this to show the behavior of the TMI as @xmath . To start,
consider the first term of the TMI formula, Eq.( C.5 ):

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the regions used are shown in Fig.( C.2 ).

If the total state @xmath has @xmath modes, then, for region @xmath , we
have @xmath modes and for its complement @xmath we have @xmath modes,
such that @xmath . Hence, the von Neumann entropy for @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the limit of very high temperature, corresponding to @xmath , we can
use the approximation ( C.2 ) and rewrite the von Neumann entropy @xmath
as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

Divide now the @xmath symplectic eigenvalues into the two sets @xmath
and @xmath , such that @xmath . Hence, we can rewrite @xmath as:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

The same argument can be repeated for the region @xmath and find that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

The @xmath symplectic eigenvalues of @xmath are all equal to @xmath ,
consequently:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the value for the mutual information @xmath in the @xmath limit is
given by

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (C.13)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

The miracle is that all the @xmath -contributions cancel out exactly
and, asymptotically, @xmath is not a function of @xmath . Using @xmath
and the area law behavior for the entropy, i.e., for regions
sufficiently big, @xmath (although this does not mean that the sets
@xmath and @xmath are the same), we can rewrite the mutual information
as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

The same argument applies for each other contribution to the TMI, for
example, for region @xmath we have:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

When substituting these expressions for the mutual information into the
TMI formula in Eq.( C.5 ), all the elements @xmath , which depend on the
size of the region boundary, sum to zero for the same reason why all the
area-dependent elements cancel out in the KP argument [ 6 ] for the
topological entanglement entropy.

Consequently, the lower limit for the TMI is simply given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath runs over all the possible combinations of regions, and the
function @xmath is defined as

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

for a partitioning of the system as in Fig. C.2 . This formula confirms
our numerics and prove that that the value of the TMI, for the
particular case of a CV surface code state, is not affected by @xmath in
the limit of thermal input states at high-temperature.

## Appendix D Expectation values in polymer quantization

In this Appendix we show the calculations to derive the expectation
values and the variances of the position and momentum-analog operators
in polymer quantization [ 50 ] . As pointed out in Chapter 7 , when we
speak about expectation value of an observable for a state @xmath , what
we really mean is extracting a physical prediction using the shadow
state @xmath that realizes the physically equivalent state to @xmath on
@xmath .
Before starting we list the definitions and results needed to perform
the calculations. First of all, recall that the variance of an operator
@xmath for some generic state @xmath with norm @xmath is given by:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (D.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

In polymer quantization, physical states are defined as @xmath and for
practical calculations we need to substitute the usual @xmath ¹ ¹ 1 À la
Schrödinger. with @xmath [ 4 ] . The space dual to @xmath is the space
of cylindrical functions with respect to some graph, in our case the
real symmetric line with spacing @xmath . An orthonormal basis on is
given by @xmath , which is the set of the eigenstates of the position
operator @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (D.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Intuitively, the dual basis @xmath is defined by the product

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (D.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the action of the translation operator @xmath on a generic state
@xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (D.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

Consider now a 1-dimensional harmonic oscillator in polymer quantization
on the real symmetric line. The shadow ground state of the harmonic
oscillator is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (D.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

and, as shown in the main text, its norm is equal to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (D.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then, the expectation value of the position operator @xmath is
calculated as

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (D.7)
              @xmath      (D.8)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where we used the definition for the dual basis @xmath in @xmath ,
@xmath and the obvious antisymmetry in the expression above, i.e. @xmath
. Interestingly enough, this is equivalent to the @xmath expectation
value for the oscillator ground state in Schrödinger quantization. To
calculate the variance we also need the expectation value of the
fluctuations @xmath , which can be derived exploiting the useful Poisson
summation formula

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (D.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then we have:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (D.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we used the substitution

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (D.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the Gaussian integral formulas [ 152 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (D.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

After having obtained the expectation value for @xmath , we can
calculate the fluctuations in @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (D.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

keeping in mind that @xmath ; for the first terms, i.e. @xmath , we
have:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (D.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

equivalent to the expectation value in the Schrödinger quantization
@xmath plus a correction induced by the discretization of the real line.
In the main text we defined the effective momentum operator by the
finite difference

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (D.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

and to obtain the expectation value @xmath one first calculates

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (D.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is equal to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (D.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

Thanks to the always useful Poisson re-summation formula and integral
tricks as shown before in this Appendix, we can rewrite the equation
above in a more suitable form:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (D.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

After keeping only the first few terms thanks to the ratio @xmath , we
have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (D.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

To normalize this value, we divide by the norm @xmath of the state:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (D.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

One can notice at first sight that the expectation value of the operator
@xmath is equal to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (D.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

since in the last expression, the @xmath parameter only appears squared
and a sign flip is irrelevant. Therefore, the expectation value of the
polymer momentum operator vanishes similarly to what happens in
Schrödinger quantization:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (D.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the main text we defined in two different ways the kinetic operator.
Canonically, it is represented by the square of the momentum operator,
which, in polymer quantization, corresponds to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (D.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is easy to calculate the fluctuations of @xmath by substituting
@xmath with @xmath in Eq.( D.20 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (D.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (D.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore one immediately derives that:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (D.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

For simplicity, a renewed version of the kinetic operator was
introduced, in order to explain how to avoid some conceptual problems
deriving from the use of the @xmath operator. This is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (D.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

whose fluctuations are calculated in an identical fashion:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (D.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

Things become a bit more complicated when trying to calculate the
expectation values for the position-momentum correlations @xmath and
@xmath . Surprisingly, the polymer approximation does not affect the
total value and one obtains that the equality @xmath holds exactly, in
accordance with Schrödinger quantization predictions. Let us show the
explicit calculations for this result. For our purposes, it is
sufficient to calculate the following quantity:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (D.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

which reduces to calculating

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (D.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

Let us consider the first half of the line above first. It is equal to:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (D.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

Proceeding in the same way, we can solve the second part of Eq.( D.30 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (D.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

and we immediately notice that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (D.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

## Appendix E List of Symbols

Here we present a list of symbols used throughout the thesis. The tables
are labeled according to the chapters they refer to. Whenever a symbol
is used throughout the thesis with the same meaning, it is only
mentioned once in the chapter where it has been introduced for the first
time.

As a general rule, matrices and vectors are depicted in bold , for
example @xmath . On the other hand, four-dimensional vectors are written
in sans serif, i.e. @xmath . Operators have a caret on top, @xmath (with
the exception of density matrices, i.e. @xmath , which always correspond
to greek letters). Bold vectors with a caret identify unit-length
vectors, for instance @xmath . Note that some symbols are repeated in
different chapters with a different meaning. Refer to the tables below
for the precise distinctions.
