In this thesis we study compactifications of type II string theories and
M-theory to four dimensions. We construct the four-dimensional N=2
supergravities that arise from compactifications of type IIA string theory and
M-theory on manifolds with SU(3)-structure. We then study their potential for
moduli stabilisation and give explicit examples where all the moduli are
stabilised. We also study the effective action for type IIB conifold
transitions on Calabi-Yau manifolds. We find that, although there are small
regions in phase space that lead to a completed transition, generically the
moduli are classically trapped at the conifold point thereby halting the
transition.
