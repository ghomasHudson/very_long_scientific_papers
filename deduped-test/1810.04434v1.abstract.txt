Twenty years have passed since the discovery of the accelerated expansion of
the Universe, reviving the interest for alternative theories of gravity. Adding
a scalar degree of freedom to the usual metric of general relativity is one of
the simplest ways to modify our gravitational theory. In parallel, our
knowledge about black holes and neutron stars is booming, notably thanks to the
advent of gravitational wave astronomy. This thesis is at the crossroads
between the two fields, investigating the properties of compact objects in
extended scalar-tensor theories. We start by reviewing essential no-hair
results established since the seventies. After discussing the no-hair theorem
proposed for black holes in Horndeski theory, we present its extension to
stars. The second part of the thesis investigates in detail the various ways to
circumvent this theorem. These notably include solutions with a time-dependent
scalar field in order to match cosmological evolution, but also static and
asymptotically flat configurations. In a third part, we establish an important
stability criterion for these solutions, based on their causal structure. It is
also the occasion to study the propagation of gravitational waves in black hole
environments, and to select the theories where gravitational waves travel at
the same speed as light.
