Let @xmath be a 3-dimensional affine variety with a faithful action of a
2-dimensional torus @xmath . Then the space of first order infinitesimal
deformations @xmath is graded by the characters of @xmath , and the
zeroth graded component @xmath consists of all equivariant first order
(infinitesimal) deformations.

Suppose that using the construction of such varieties from [ 1 ] , one
can obtain @xmath from a proper polyhedral divisor @xmath on @xmath such
that the tail cone of (any of) the used polyhedra is pointed and
full-dimensional, and all vertices of all polyhedra are lattice points.
Then we compute @xmath and find a formally versal equivariant
deformation of @xmath . We also establish a connection between our
formula for @xmath and known formulas for the dimensions of the graded
components of @xmath of toric varieties.
