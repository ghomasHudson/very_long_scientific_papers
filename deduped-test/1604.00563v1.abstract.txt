The Sun is a magnetically active star and is the source of the solar wind,
electromagnetic radiation and energetic particles which affect the heliosphere
and the Earths atmosphere. The magnetic field of the Sun is responsible for
most of the dynamic activity of the Sun. This thesis research seeks to
understand solar magnetic field generation and the role that magnetic fields
play in the dynamics of the solar atmosphere. Specifically, this thesis focuses
on two themes: in the first part, we study the origin and behaviour of solar
magnetic fields using magnetohydrodynamic dynamo theory and modelling, and in
the second part, utilizing observations and data analysis we study two major
problems in solar physics, namely, the coronal heating problem and initiation
mechanisms of solar flares.
