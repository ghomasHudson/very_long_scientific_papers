[Shortened abstract:] In this thesis we investigate a solution to the
`problem of time' in canonical quantum gravity by splitting spacetime into
surfaces of constant mean curvature parameterised by York time. We argue that
there are reasons to consider York time a viable candidate for a physically
meaningful notion of time. We investigate a number York-time
Hamiltonian-reduced cosmological models and explore some technical aspects,
such as the non-canonical Poisson structure. We develop York-time
Hamiltonian-reduced cosmological perturbation theory by solving the Hamiltonian
constraint perturbatively around a homogeneous background for the physical
(non-vanishing) Hamiltonian that is the momentum conjugate to the York time
parameter. We proceed to canonically quantise the cosmological models and the
perturbation theory and discuss a number of conceptual and technical points,
such as volume eigenfunctions and the absence of a momentum representation due
to the non-standard commutator structure. We propose an alternative,
wavefunction-free method of quantisation based on an ensemble of trajectories
and a dynamical configuration-space geometry and discuss its application to
gravity. We conclude by placing the York-time theories explored in this thesis
in the wider context of a search for a satisfactory theory of quantum gravity.
