In this thesis we present a new formalism to study linear and non-linear
response in extended systems. Our approach is based on real-time solution of an
effective Schr\"odinger equation. The coupling between electrons and external
field is described by means of Modern Theory of Polarization. Correlation
effects are derived from Green's function theory. We show that the inclusion of
local-field effects and electron-hole interaction is crucial to predict and
reproduce second and third harmonic generation in low dimensional structures,
where strong bound excitons are present. Finally in the last part we introduce
a real-time density functional approach suitable for infinite periodic crystals
in which we work within the so-called length gauge and calculate the
polarisation as a dynamical Berry's phase. This approach, in addition to the
electron density considers also the macroscopic polarisation as a main variable
to correctly treat periodic crystals in presence of electric fields within a
density functional framework.
