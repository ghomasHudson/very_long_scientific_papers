In this thesis I study various aspects of theories in the two most studied
examples of noncommutative spacetimes: canonical spacetime
($[x_{\mu},x_{\nu}]=\theta_{\mu\nu}$) and $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime
($[x_{i},t]=\kappa^{-1} x_{i}$). In the first part of the thesis I consider the
description of the propagation of "classical" waves in these spacetimes. In the
case of $\kappa$-Minkowski this description is rather nontrivial, and its
phenomenological implications are rather striking.
  In the second part of the thesis I examine the structure of quantum field
theory in noncommutative spacetime, with emphasis on the simple case of the
canonical spacetime. I find that the so-called IR/UV mixing can affect
significantly the phase structure of a quantum field theory and also forces us
upon a certain revision of the strategies used in particle-physics
phenomenology to constrain the parameters of a model.
