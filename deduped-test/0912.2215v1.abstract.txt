In the first part we define a "BTZ" black hole in anti de Sitter space in any
dimension by defining as "singular" the closed orbits of the Iwasawa component
of SO(2,n).
  In the second part, a strict quantization of the black hole by action of
group is performed and its Dirac operator is computed.
  We introduce, in the appendix, most of the notions about homogeneous spaces
and Iwasawa decompositions that are needed. Explicit matricial decompositions
are given for every Lie algebra that will be used in the thesis: sl(2,R),
so(1,n), so(2,n), sl(2,C) and sp(2,R).
