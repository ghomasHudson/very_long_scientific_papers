A semantics for quantified modal logic is presented that is based on
Kleene’s notion of realizability. This semantics generalizes Flagg’s
1985 construction of a model of a modal version of Church’s Thesis and
first-order arithmetic. While the bulk of the paper is devoted to
developing the details of the semantics, to illustrate the scope of this
approach, we show that the construction produces (i) a model of a modal
version of Church’s Thesis and a variant of a modal set theory due to
Goodman and Scedrov, (ii) a model of a modal version of Troelstra’s
generalized continuity principle together with a fragment of
second-order arithmetic, and (iii) a model based on Scott’s graph model
(for the untyped lambda calculus) which witnesses the failure of the
stability of non-identity.
