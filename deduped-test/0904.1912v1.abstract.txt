This thesis investigate the channel estimation and the postprocessing of the
quantum key distribution protocols. In particular, we propose a new channel
estimation procedure, in which we utilize the bit sequences transmitted and
received by different bases, and a new postprocessing with two-way classical
communication. Then, we show that the key generation rates of the QKD protocols
with our channel estimation and/or our postprocessing are higher than those
with conventional ones.
