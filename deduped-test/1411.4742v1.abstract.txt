In order to better understand the plasma supply and leakage at active
regions, we investigated physical properties of the upflows from edges of
active region NOAA AR10978 observed with the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS)
onboard Hinode. Our observational aim is to measure two quantities of the
outflows: Doppler velocity and electron density.
