One of the most promising platforms for one-dimensional topological
superconductivity is based on semiconducting nanowires with strong spin-orbit
coupling (SOC), where s-wave superconductivity is induced by proximity effect
and an external Zeeman field drives the system into the topological
superconducting phase with Majorana bound states (MBSs) at the end of the wire.
During last years this idea has led to a great number of important experiments
in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor systems, where the main signature is an
emergent zero-bias peak (ZBP) in the differential conductance as the Zeeman
field is increased.
  This thesis focuses on the study of hybrid superconductor-semiconductor
junctions made of semiconducting nanowires with Rashba SOC. We emphasise the
importance of employing hybrids superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions
towards the unambiguously detection of MBSs beyond zero-bias anomalies.
