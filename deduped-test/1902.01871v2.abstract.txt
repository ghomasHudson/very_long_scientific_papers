The first main result is that the Casselman-Wallach Globalization of a real
analytic family of Harish-Chandra modules is continuous in the parameter. Our
proof of this result uses results from the thesis of Vincent van der Noort in
several critical ways. In his thesis the holomorphic version of the result was
proved in the case when the parameter space is a one dimensional complex
manifold up to a branched covering. The second main result is a proof of the
meromorphic continuation of $C^{\infty}$ Eisenstein series.using Langlands'
results in the $K$ finite case as an application of the methods in the proof of
the first part.
