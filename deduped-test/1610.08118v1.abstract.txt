The study of traversable wormholes is very hot topic for the past 30 years.
One of the best possible way to make traversable wormhole is using the
thin-shells to cut and paste two spacetime which has tunnel from one region of
space-time to another, through which a traveler might freely pass in wormhole
throat. These geometries need an exotic matter which involves a stress-energy
tensor that violates the null energy condition. However, this method can be
used to minimize the amount of the exotic matter. The goal of this thesis study
is to study on thin-shell and thin-shell wormholes in general relativity in 2+1
and 3+1 dimensions. We also investigate the stability of such objects.
