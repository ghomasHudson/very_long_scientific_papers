## Chapter 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

The neutrino was proposed by Pauli in 1929 “ ….as a desperate remedy to
save the principle of energy conservation in beta decay ”. This particle
which can take part only in weak interactions was discovered
experimentally by Reines and Cowan in 1956. Neutrinos can come in
different flavors in analogy to the different flavors of charged
leptons. However, the decay width of Z @xmath boson in the LEP2
experiment restricts the number of light active neutrinos to three [ 1 ]
. We now have experimental evidence for the existence of all the three
types of neutrinos, @xmath , @xmath and @xmath .

The neutrino is known to be a neutral particle which carries a spin 1/2.
But whether it has mass or not has been an intriguing issue ever since
it was proposed. The direct upper limits on neutrino masses are quite
poor. The limit on @xmath mass is obtained from tritium beta decay
experiments and the best bound is @xmath eV [ 2 ] . The bounds on @xmath
and @xmath masses are much more weaker, @xmath 190 keV and @xmath 18 MeV
[ 3 ] . If the neutrinos are assumed to be Majorana particles then
another experimental bound on neutrino mass comes from the neutrino-less
double beta decay experiments ( @xmath or @xmath , where J is a
Majoron). This is a lepton number violating process which will be
possible only if the neutrinos are massive Majorana particles. From the
non-observation of this process the most stringent bounds on the
Majorana neutrino mass is @xmath eV at 90% C.L. [ 4 ] .

Even though these upper bounds, particularly the ones coming from direct
mass searches are still weak (these limits on neutrino masses far exceed
the cosmological bound which we will discuss later), they clearly
indicate that the neutrino masses are much smaller than the mass of the
corresponding charged leptons. This leads to an intra-familial hierarchy
problem, a challenge for any model which can predict neutrino mass. In
the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam standard model of particle physics, which is
consistent with all known experimental data till date, the neutrinos are
assumed to be massless. However there is no underlying gauge symmetry
which forbids neutrino mass, unlike as in the case of the photons. In
most extensions of the standard model, the Grand Unified theories and
the supersymmetric models, the neutrino is massive [ 5 , 6 ] .

If one does allow for non-zero neutrino mass then the flavor eigenstates
of the neutrino can be different from the mass eigenstates. One then
encounters the quantum mechanical phenomenon of neutrino flavor mixing
where one neutrino flavor oscillates into another flavor due to
interference effects. The parameters involved in this process is the
mass square difference between the two states which mix, @xmath and the
mixing angle between them, @xmath . This mechanism can probe very small
neutrino masses. Neutrino flavor oscillations was conjectured long ago
as a plausible solution to the solar neutrino problem [ 7 ] and the
atmospheric neutrino anomaly [ 8 ] .

The thermonuclear fusion reactions responsible for energy generation in
the Sun release a huge flux of neutrinos. This flux of pure @xmath
arriving from the Sun have been measured for almost the last 40 years
now by the Homestake, SAGE, GALLEX/GNO, Kamiokande, Super-Kamiokande and
the SNO experiments. All these experiments have observed a deficit of
the solar neutrino flux predicted by the “standard solar model” (SSM) [
9 ] . This discrepancy between theory and experiment came to be known as
the solar neutrino problem. Neutrino flavor mixing – either in vacuum [
10 ] or in solar matter [ 11 ] – can account for the solution to this
apparent anomaly. The most favored solution to the global data demands a
@xmath eV @xmath and large values for the mixing angle.

The atmospheric neutrinos are produced due to collision of the cosmic
ray particles with the air nuclei. These neutrinos were detected in
large water @xmath erenkov experiments which reported a depletion of the
@xmath flux compared to expectation. Solution to this atmospheric
neutrino anomaly again called for neutrino flavor oscillations with
@xmath eV @xmath and maximal mixing to reconcile data with predictions.
The results from the Super-Kamiokande (SK) atmospheric neutrino
experiment in 1998 [ 8 ] became a hallmark in the history of particle
physics when it finally confirmed that the atmospheric neutrinos do
oscillate and are hence indeed massive. The observation of neutrino mass
in the SK experiment (although indirect) is the first and till date the
only evidence of physics beyond the standard model.

There have been many terrestrial neutrino oscillation searches using
both accelerators as well as reactors as neutrino sources [ 12 , 13 ] .
But all of them except the LSND experiment at Los Alamos, have yielded
negative results for neutrino oscillations. The LSND experiment has
continued to give positive signal for oscillations since 1996 with
@xmath eV @xmath [ 14 ] . Thus we have three indications of neutrino
oscillations. However since the three different hints demand three
different values of @xmath , it is difficult to explain all the
experimental data in the framework of three neutrinos. There have been
quite a few attempts in the literature to explain all the three
experiments with three flavors but it is largely believed that if the
LSND results are correct then one has to introduce a fourth sterile
neutrino.

Neutrinos are known to play a pivotal role in the supernova dynamics and
nucleosynthesis. A huge flux of neutrinos and antineutrinos are released
during the thermal cooling phase of a core collapse supernova. These
neutrinos can be detected in the terrestrial detectors. The detection of
the neutrinos from SN1987A in the Kamiokande and IMB [ 15 ] gave birth
to the subject of neutrino astronomy and heralded the beginning of a new
era in neutrino physics. A careful study of the resultant neutrino
signal from a galactic supernova in the terrestrial detectors, can throw
light on not just the type-II supernova mechanism but also on the
neutrino mass and mixing parameters.

The neutrinos are the most abundant entities in the Universe after
radiation. Hence even a small mass for the neutrinos can make a huge
difference to the total mass of the Universe. The energy density of the
neutrinos cannot exceed the total energy density of the Universe and
this puts a strong upper bound on the sum of all the light neutrino
species [ 16 ] , @xmath eV [ 5 ] . Small neutrino masses can be an
important component of the dark matter . Since neutrinos were
relativistic at the time of structure formation they are called “hot”
dark matter. It is believed that a combination of hot+cold dark matter
is required for a correct explanation of this problem. Neutrino
properties and number of neutrino generations are also severely
constrained by primordial nucleosynthesis arguments.

Neutrinos play a crucial role in the understanding of stellar evolution,
type-II supernova mechanism, nucleosynthesis and dark matter studies. A
huge amount of theoretical and experimental effort has gone into the
study of neutrino properties. Thus the importance of the subject
warrants a detailed analysis of the neutrino mass and mixing parameters
in the context of the current experimental data and a careful study of
its implication for astrophysics.

### 1.2 Plan of Thesis

In this thesis we explore the implications of neutrino oscillations in
the context of solar neutrino problem, atmospheric neutrino anomaly and
the terrestrial accelerator/reactor neutrino oscillation experiments. We
perform detailed statistical analyses of the solar and atmospheric
neutrino data and map out the regions of the parameters space consistent
with the experiments. We investigate the effect of neutrino mass and
mixing on the predicted neutrino signal from a galactic supernova in the
current water @xmath erenkov detectors.

We begin in chapter 2 with the presentation of the basic aspects of
neutrino oscillations in vacuum and in matter. We discuss the adiabatic
and non-adiabatic propagation of neutrinos in a medium with varying
density and present the expressions for the survival probability.

In chapter 3 we give a detailed description of the current status of the
neutrino oscillation experiments in terms of two flavor oscillations.
For the solar neutrinos we present a brief review of the SSM
predictions, summarize the main experimental results, work out the
unified formalism for the solar neutrino survival probability, describe
our solar neutrino code and perform a comprehensive @xmath analysis of
the global solar data. Similarly for the atmospheric neutrinos we
discuss the theoretical flux predictions, the SK experimental data, our
atmospheric code and perform a @xmath fit with the @xmath oscillation
scenario. We briefly review the bounds from the most important
accelerator/reactor experiments.

We extend our study of the solar neutrinos in chapter 4 where we probe
the potential of the energy independent solution in describing the
global solar neutrino data. We investigate the signatures of this
scenario in the future solar neutrino experiments.

In chapter 5 we analyse the SK atmospheric neutrino data and the
accelerator/reactor data in a three-generation framework. We present the
results of the @xmath analysis of (1) only the SK data and (2) SK+CHOOZ
data and compare the allowed regions with those obtained from the
accelerator/reactor experiments. For the only SK analysis we indicate
some new allowed regions with very small @xmath which appear due to
matter effects peculiar to the mass spectrum of the neutrinos that we
have chosen here. We study the implications of this mass spectrum in the
K2K experiment.

In chapter 6 we work in a scheme where one of the components in the
neutrino beam is unstable and explore the viability of this decay model
as a solution to the atmospheric neutrino problem.

In chapter 7 we make quantitative predictions for the number of events
recorded in the current water @xmath erenkov detectors due a galactic
supernova. We examine the signatures of neutrino mass and mixing which
can show up in the detectors and suggest various variables that can be
used to study the effect of oscillations in the resultant signal.

We present our conclusions in chapter 8 with a few comments on the
physics potential of the most exciting future detectors.

## Chapter 2 Neutrino Oscillations

Neutrino oscillations in vacuum is analogous to @xmath oscillations in
its quantum mechanical nature. Neutrinos produced in their flavor
eigenstates lack definite mass if they are massive and mixed. The states
with definite mass are the mass eigenstates and neutrino propagation
from the production to the detection point is governed by the equation
of motion of the mass eigenstates. Finally the neutrinos are detected by
weak interactions involving the flavor states, leading to the phenomenon
of neutrino oscillations, first suggested by Bruno Pontecorvo [ 1 ] and
later by Maki et al [ 2 ] . Some very good reviews on neutrino
oscillations include [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] .

When neutrinos move through matter they interact with the ambient
electrons, protons and neutrons. As a result of this they pick up an
effective mass much the same way as photons acquire mass on moving
through a medium. This phenomenon has non-trivial impact on the mixing
scenario of the neutrinos. In section 2.1 we first develop the formalism
for neutrino oscillations in vacuum. In section 2.2 we discuss in detail
the effect of matter on the mass and mixing parameters of the neutrinos.

### 2.1 Neutrino Oscillations in Vacuum

The flavor eigenstate @xmath created in a weak interaction process can
be expressed as a linear superposition of the mass eigenstates @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the unitary mixing matrix analogous to the
Cabibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix in the quark sector. We consider the
general case of neutrinos with @xmath flavors and henceforth set @xmath
. After time t, the initial @xmath evolves to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the energy of the @xmath mass eigenstate. For simplicity
we assume that the 3-momentum p of the different components of the
neutrino beam are the same. The energy @xmath of the @xmath component is
given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the mass of the @xmath mass eigenstate. However since
the masses are non-degenerate, the @xmath are different for the
different components and eq. ( 2.2 ) is a different superposition of
@xmath compared to eq. ( 2.1 ). Hence one expects the presence of other
flavor states in the resultant beam in addition to the original flavor.
The amplitude of finding a flavor @xmath in the original @xmath beam is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

Hence the corresponding probability is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

For ultra relativistic neutrinos with a common definite momentum p ,
@xmath and t can be replaced by the distance traveled L. Then we obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.6)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

is the oscillation wavelength which denotes the scale over which
neutrino oscillation effects can be significant and @xmath . The actual
forms of the various survival and transition probabilities depend on the
neutrino mass spectrum assumed and the choice of the mixing matrix
@xmath relating the flavor eigenstates to the mass eigenstates. The
oscillatory character is embedded in the @xmath term. Depending on the
value of @xmath and @xmath , if the oscillation wavelength is such that
@xmath , @xmath , the oscillations do not get a chance to develop and
the neutrino survival probability is @xmath . On the other hand, @xmath
implies a large number of oscillations, so that once the averaging over
energy and/or the distance traveled is done @xmath and one encounters
what is called average oscillations. But when @xmath then one has full
oscillation effects and constraints on @xmath can be put from
observations of the resultant neutrino beam.

If we restrict ourselves to two-generations for simplicity then the
mixing matrix takes a simple form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.9)
     @xmath      (2.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is called the mixing angle. The expression of the
transition probability from @xmath to a different flavor @xmath reduces
to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

The survival probability of the original neutrino beam is simply

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.12)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

### 2.2 Neutrino Oscillations in Matter

So far we have discussed the neutrino transition and survival
probabilities in vacuum. When neutrinos move through a medium they
interact with the ambient matter and this interaction modifies their
effective masses and mixing. It was pointed out in [ 9 , 10 ] that the
patterns of neutrino oscillations might be significantly affected if the
neutrinos travel through a material medium. This is because normal
matter has only electrons and so the @xmath experience both charged as
well as neutral current interactions while the @xmath and @xmath can
participate in only neutral current processes.

Since the flavor eigenstates are involved in weak interactions we work
in the flavor basis for the time being and will introduce neutrino
mixing later. All the expression for the interaction terms given below
are for neutrinos. The corresponding expressions for antineutrinos are
same with a -ve sign. The charged current scattering of @xmath with
electrons gives the following contribution to the Lagrangian

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the Fermi coupling constant. On rearranging the spinors
using Fierz transformation one gets

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

For forward scattering of neutrinos off electrons, the neutrino momentum
remains the same so that charged current contribution after averaging
the electron field over the background becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

The axial current part of @xmath gives the spin in the non-relativistic
limit while the spatial part of the vector component gives the average
velocity, both of which are negligible for a non-relativistic collection
of electrons. So the only non-vanishing contribution comes from the
@xmath component which gives the electron density.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the ambient electron density. The extra contribution to
the Lagrangian then reduces to @xmath . Hence for unpolarized electrons
at rest, the forward charged current scattering of neutrinos off
electron gives rise to an effective potential

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

The effect of this term is to change the effective energy of the @xmath
in matter to

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Thus the charged current interaction gives rise to an extra effective
contribution to the @xmath mass square called @xmath or the Wolfenstein
term [ 9 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

The neutral current contribution to the effective neutrino energies can
be calculated in an identical manner and comes out to be

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath stands for the electron, proton or neutron, @xmath is the
density of @xmath in the surrounding matter, @xmath is the charge of
@xmath and @xmath is the third component of weak isospin of the left
chiral projection of @xmath . Since for the proton @xmath and @xmath ,
while for the electron @xmath and @xmath and since normal matter is
charge neutral ensuring that @xmath , the contributions due to electron
and proton cancel each other exactly. Hence the only remaining
contribution is due to the neutrons for which @xmath and @xmath so that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

In order to see the effect of these extra contributions due to
interactions of the neutrino beam with the ambient matter, on neutrino
mass and mixing parameters, let us look at the equation of motion for
the neutrino states. We restrict ourselves to a two-generation scheme
for simplicity ( @xmath mixing with either @xmath or @xmath ) and first
write down the evolution equation for the mass eigenstates in vacuum
which can be subsequently extended to include matter effects. The
equation of motion for the mass eigenstates in vacuum can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the mass matrix, diagonal in the mass basis

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

As the interaction terms are defined in the flavor basis we have to look
at the evolution equation in the flavor basis. Since the mass
eigenstates are related to the flavor eigenstates by the relation ( 2.1
) and since the mixing matrix in two-generations is given by ( 2.8 ),
the equation of motion in terms of the flavor states can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.25)
              @xmath   @xmath      (2.26)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the vacuum mass matrix in the flavor basis and @xmath .
We next include in the mass matrix the interaction terms in the mass
matrix for neutrinos moving through matter. Once these extra
contributions to the Hamiltonian due to interactions of the neutrino
with matter are taken into account, the equation of motion for the
neutrino beam in the flavor basis is given by eq. ( 2.24 ) with the
@xmath in vacuum replaced with @xmath in matter given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.27)
                                @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where @xmath as defined before. The terms proportional to the identity
matrix play absolutely no role in flavor mixing and can be safely
dropped. Hence we see that the neutral current term which affect all the
flavors equally, falls out of the oscillation analysis and the only
non-trivial contribution comes from the charged current interaction.

The energy eigenvalues in matter are obtained by diagonalising the mass
matrix @xmath . We define @xmath to be the mass eigenvalues and @xmath
to be the mixing matrix in matter. In analogy with the vacuum case
@xmath can be parametrized as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the mixing angle in matter. Then since

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

the eigenvalues of the mass matrix are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

Hence the mass squared difference @xmath in vacuum is modified in
presence of matter to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

while the mixing angle in matter is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

or equivalently

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

The mass and the mixing angle in matter are changed substantially
compared to their vacuum values depending on the value of @xmath
relative to @xmath . This change is most dramatic when the condition

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

is satisfied. If this condition is attained in matter then @xmath and
the mixing angle in matter become maximal irrespective of the value of
the mixing angle in vacuum. So even a small mixing in vacuum can be
amplified to maximal mixing due to matter effects This is called the
matter enhanced resonance effect or the the Mikhevey-Smirnov-Wolfenstein
or the MSW effect [ 9 , 10 , 11 ] which is the favored solution to the
Solar Neutrino Problem, a subject we shall address later in great
details. Note that for @xmath one encounters this resonance for
neutrinos ( @xmath ) only if @xmath . Also note that the expression (
2.34 ) can be rewritten as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the electron density at the point of neutrino production
and @xmath is the corresponding density at resonance. So that for @xmath
the mixing angle in matter @xmath .

We next look for the electron neutrino survival probability. For a
constant density medium the survival probability is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.38)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.39)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Hence for a constant density medium the expressions for transition and
survival probabilities are exactly similar to ones for the vacuum case,
with the mass squared difference and the mixing angle replaced by the
corresponding terms in matter. But things get more complicated when the
neutrinos move through a medium of varying density. We address this
complex issue in the next section.

#### 2.2.1 Neutrino Survival Probability in Medium with Varying Density

In most situations encountered in nature the neutrinos propagate through
medium with varying density. Since the eigenstates and the eigenvalues
of the mass matrix both depend on the density of the medium, the mass
eigenstates defined in eq. ( 2.28 ) are no longer the stationary
eigenstates. For varying density one can define the stationary
eigenstates only for the Hamiltonian at a given point. Starting from the
equation of motion in the flavor basis and dropping the irrelevant terms
proportional to the identity matrix we have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.40)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where we have substituted @xmath for @xmath . Keeping in mind that the
mixing matrix is now @xmath dependent we obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.41)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

The off diagonal terms in eq. ( 2.41 ) mix the states @xmath and @xmath
and the mass eigenstates in matter keep changing with @xmath . Hence one
has to solve the eq. ( 2.41 ) to get the survival and transition
probabilities. However the mass eigenstates travel approximately
unchanged and unmixed as long as the off diagonal terms in ( 2.41 ) are
small compared to the diagonal terms. Since the terms proportional to
the unit matrix do not affect oscillation probabilities, the only
physical parameter in the diagonal elements is their difference. Thus
the condition for the off diagonal term to be small can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is called the adiabatic condition . Since @xmath has a maximum at
resonance while @xmath has a minimum, the adiabaticity condition becomes
most stringent at the resonance. One can define an adiabaticity
parameter as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

The adiabatic condition then reduces to @xmath . Depending on whether
the adiabatic condition is satisfied or not neutrino propagation in
matter may be of two types: adiabatic and non-adiabatic .

@xmath The Adiabatic Case: If one can neglect the off diagonal terms in
eq. ( 2.41 ) in comparison to the diagonal elements, @xmath and @xmath
approximately become the eigenstate of the mass matrix. This is the
adiabatic approximation. As long as the adiabatic condition is
satisfied, the two mass states evolve independently and there is no
mixing between them. The @xmath state created in matter then remains a
@xmath always. This is the adiabatic propagation of neutrinos in matter.
Adiabatic propagation of neutrinos in matter has very interesting
consequences. For example, consider the neutrinos produced at the center
of the Sun or a supernova. Since the matter density at the point of
production of these neutrinos is much higher that the resonance density,
the mixing angle @xmath and since

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

the @xmath are created almost entirely in the heavier @xmath state.
Thereafter the neutrino moves adiabatically towards lower densities,
crosses the resonance when @xmath and finally comes out into the vacuum.
Since the motion was adiabatic the heavier state remains the heavier
state even after it comes out. Since in vacuum the heavier state is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

the survival probability of the electron neutrino is just @xmath . Hence
for very small values of the mixing angle @xmath one may have almost
complete conversion of the @xmath produced inside the sun.

In the discussion above the survival probability is @xmath for @xmath .
For any general angle @xmath at the production point of the neutrino,
the survival probability is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

@xmath The Non-Adiabatic case: One may encounter cases where @xmath and
the adiabatic condition ( 2.42 ) is not satisfied. This breakdown of
adiabaticity is most pronounced at the position of resonance as
discussed in the previous section. This violation of adiabaticity at the
resonance signals that the off diagonal terms in eq. ( 2.41 ) become
comparable to the diagonal terms and there is a finite probability of
transition from one mass eigenstate to another. This transition
probability between the mass eigenstates is called the level crossing or
the jump probability . It is defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath refer to two faraway points on either side of the
resonance. @xmath can be determined by solving the equation of motion (
2.41 ) for a given matter density profile. For a linearly varying
density, the jump probability is given by the Landau-Zener expression [
12 , 13 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the adiabaticity parameter given by eq. ( 2.43 ). For
the Sun the density profile is roughly exponential and we will address
that issue in the next chapter.

The electron neutrino survival probability, taking into account the
finite level crossing between the mass eigenstates due to breakdown of
adiabaticity is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

This can be easily computed if one knows the form of @xmath .

#### 2.2.2 Matter Effects with Sterile Neutrinos

In the entire discussion above on the effect of matter on neutrino mass
and mixing we had tacitly assumed that both the flavors involved in
oscillations were active flavors, that is, can take part in weak
interactions. But one may consider situations where one of the states
involved is sterile . Sterile states have no interactions with the
surrounding medium, neither charged nor neutral. Thus for the @xmath
mixing, relevant for the solar neutrino problem, the mixing angle and
the mass squared difference in matter are given by,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.50)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.51)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The survival probability @xmath is still given by eqs. ( 2.46 ) and (
2.49 ). For the @xmath mixing, relevant for the atmospheric neutrino
anomaly the corresponding expressions are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.52)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.53)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Note however that whether the neutrinos are oscillating into active or
sterile species matter only when a material medium is involved. The
oscillations in vacuum is the same for both the cases.

## Chapter 3 Bounds on Two Flavor Neutrino Mixing Parameters

The question whether neutrinos are massive or not has been answered. The
Super-Kamiokande (SK) atmospheric neutrino data has quelled all
apprehensions about the existence of neutrino flavor mixing and has
propelled neutrino physics to the forefront of particle phenomenology.
The other puzzle which has warranted neutrino oscillations as a
plausible solution is the long standing solar neutrino problem. For the
last four decades solar neutrino detectors have recorded a flux far less
than that predicted by solar models. Though the theory of neutrino
flavor oscillations can offer the best possible solution to this
anomaly, there are still a lot of issues that have to be settled.
Finally there have been earnest searches for neutrino flavor mixing in
the laboratory, using both reactors as well as accelerators as sources
for neutrino beams. But all such quests have lead to negative results,
with the exception of the LSND experiment at Los Alamos which has
reiterated since 1996 to have observed positive neutrino oscillation
signals.

In this chapter we survey the current status of the solar neutrino
problem, the atmospheric neutrino anomaly and the laboratory
experiments. We briefly discuss the incident neutrino fluxes, the
detection techniques, present the main experimental results and perform
detailed statistical analysis of the solar and the atmospheric neutrino
data in terms of two-generation neutrino oscillations. We describe our
solar and atmospheric neutrino code and discuss the method of @xmath
analysis. We identify the best-fit solutions and display the allowed
regions in the neutrino parameter space. We begin with the solar
neutrino problem in section 3.1, next take up the case of the
atmospheric neutrino anomaly in section 3.2 and finally move over to the
description of the most stringent accelerator/reactor experiments in
section 3.3.

### 3.1 The Solar Neutrino Problem

Neutrinos are an essential byproduct of the thermonuclear energy
generation process inside the Sun whereby four proton nuclei are fused
into an alpha particle.

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

This process is called Hydrogen Burning and is responsible for the
hydrostatic equilibrium of the Sun. About 2-3% of the total energy
released in the process ( 3.1 ) is carried away by the neutrinos. The
rest is in the form of electromagnetic radiation, which diffuses out
from the core to the surface of the Sun, getting degraded in frequency
to appear as sunlight. It takes millions of years for the photons to
emerge from the Sun due to interactions with the solar matter. As a
result of these repeated scatterings, the photons cannot give us any
direct information about the core of the Sun. The neutrinos on the other
hand have typical scattering cross sections of about @xmath cm @xmath ,
which for a solar density of about 100 g/cc gives a mean free path of
the order of @xmath cm. This is much larger than the radius of the Sun.
The neutrinos escape from the Sun unadulterated and bring along, all the
information about the solar core imprinted on them. Thus a careful study
of these neutrinos promises to provide detailed information about the
solar interiors and the thermonuclear energy generation process inside
the core and hence holds the potential to verify or refute the existing
solar models.

Keeping this in mind, Ray Davis began his pioneering experiment in which
neutrinos are captured by the @xmath atoms [ 1 ] . The corresponding
work on theoretical predictions for the solar neutrino fluxes were done
by Bahcall and his collaborators [ 2 ] in the framework of what is
called the “standard solar model”. The first results of this experiment
were declared in 1968 [ 1 ] . This experiment has been running for
almost four decades now [ 3 ] and the results have been remarkably
robust; the experiment sees a depletion of the solar neutrino flux over
the standard solar model (SSM) predictions. The solar neutrinos seem to
vanish on their way from the Sun to the Earth and this mystery of
missing solar neutrinos constitutes the Solar Neutrino Problem (SNP).
Two decades later the Kamiokande water @xmath erenkov experiment
corroborated this observed deficit of solar neutrinos [ 4 ] . This
conflict between the SSM prediction and observation has been further
substantiated by the results from the @xmath experiments – the SAGE [ 5
] , the GALLEX [ 6 ] and now the GNO [ 7 ] , which is the upgraded
version of the GALLEX. The advent of the Super-Kamiokande [ 8 , 9 , 10 ]
, the upgraded version the the original Kamiokande experiment, brought
with it rich statistics, which provided further insight into the SNP in
terms of the overall depletion of the solar flux [ 8 ] , the energy
dependence of the suppression rate [ 9 ] and the presence of any
difference in the observed rate at day and at night, a phenomenon called
the day-night effect [ 10 ] . The recently declared results on the
electron scattering events (ES) from the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory
(SNO) [ 11 ] are consistent with the observations of SK while their
charged current (CC) events when compared with the SK events signify the
presence of a @xmath component in the resultant neutrino beam at the
@xmath level while the total solar flux is calculated to be @xmath which
is in agreement with the SSM predictions [ 11 ] .

Thus if the neutrinos are assumed to be the standard particle predicted
by the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam standard model of particle physics then
there seems to be an apparent discrepancy between the experimental
observations and the SSM predictions. There have been several attempts
in the literature to explain the experimental results by modifying the
solar models, assuming neutrinos to be standard. These endevours are
collectively called the astrophysical solutions . In the most general
class of these solutions the solar neutrino fluxes are considered as
free parameters, with the only requirement being the reproduction of the
observed solar luminosity [ 12 ] . But all such analyses fail to explain
the observations from all the three experiments, Cl, Ga and water @xmath
erenkov simultaneously. In fact the best-fit for these solutions predict
a negative flux for the @xmath neutrino which is an unphysical
situation. The astrophysical solutions fail to explain even two of the
solar neutrino results simultaneously. After the declaration of the SNO
results the astrophysical solution has fallen into further disfavor [ 13
, 14 ] . In [ 13 ] Bahcall has shown that while prior to SNO the
astrophysical solution failed to fit the data at the @xmath level, after
including the SNO data it is ruled out at @xmath . Thus it is not the
uncertainties in the solar models that are responsible for this anomaly.
In fact the solar models have been remarkably refined in the last four
decades and the flux uncertainties have been reduced to a large extent.
Hence one needs to consider some non-standard property for the neutrino
in order to be able to reconcile the data with the standard solar model
predictions.

Among the various particle physics solutions proposed till date,
neutrino oscillations in vacuum [ 15 ] and/or in matter [ 16 , 17 ] ,
have been the first and the most appealing solution [ 18 , 19 , 20 , 21
, 22 ] . Neutrino flavor mixing has the potential to explain not only
the total suppression of the solar flux, but also the energy dependence
of the suppression factor and the day-night asymmetry. The analysis of
the solar neutrino problem in terms of neutrino mass and mixing gives
four pockets of allowed area in the neutrino oscillation parameter
space. One of them has @xmath eV @xmath and mixing angles very small and
is called the small mixing angle (SMA) region. Another has @xmath eV
@xmath with large mixing angles and is referred to as the large mixing
angle (LMA) solution. A third allowed zone has @xmath in the range
@xmath eV @xmath and mixing angle close to maximal. This is the LOW-QVO
region, LOW stands for low @xmath and QVO for quasi vacuum oscillations
. The last region is the one associated with vacuum neutrino
oscillations with @xmath eV @xmath and mixing close to maximal. While
doing an analysis of the solar data one has to consider @xmath
oscillations to either an active flavor ( @xmath , @xmath ) or some
sterile species ( @xmath ). The latter case will be different, firstly
because the sterile neutrinos will not show up in the detectors in the
neutral current interactions even though @xmath , @xmath can. This
feature affects both the MSW as well as the vacuum solutions. For the
MSW solutions there is an extra difference as the sterile neutrinos do
not have any interaction with the ambient matter, both in the Sun and in
the Earth. Thus the effect of matter on the mixing parameters will be
different for the @xmath as compared to @xmath , as discussed in the
previous chapter.

We perform detailed @xmath -fits for both the @xmath and @xmath
transformations. We perform a global @xmath analysis of the solar
neutrino data from all experiments in the framework of neutrino mass and
mixing. We adopt an unified approach for the presentation of the MSW,
the vacuum and quasi-vacuum oscillations solutions. We find the best-fit
solution to the global data and show the allowed regions in the @xmath -
@xmath parameter space. From the global analysis of all available solar
neutrino data, one finds that the large mixing angle @xmath MSW solution
gives the best fit.

Section 3.1.1 is a brief discussion on the solar neutrino flux
predictions in the standard solar models and the various uncertainties
involved. In section 3.1.2 we briefly present the essential features of
the solar neutrino experiments and summarize their main results. In
section 3.1.3 we discuss the solar neutrino code developed by us. In
section 3.1.4 we introduce neutrino flavor mixing and develop the
unified formalism for the analysis of the SNP in the context of neutrino
mixing. Finally in section 3.1.5 we present the results of a
comprehensive @xmath analysis of the solar neutrino data. We identify
the best fit solutions and give C.L. allowed areas in the neutrino
parameter space.

#### 3.1.1 Neutrinos in Standard Solar Models

“Standard Solar Model” is a solar model constructed with the best
available physics and input data. Almost all solar models postulate the
thermonuclear fusion of protons ( 3.1 ) to be the main energy generation
process in the Sun [ 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 ] . The eq. ( 3.1
) is actually the compactified form for a chain of reactions in which
four hydrogen nuclei are fused to form a helium nucleus. This chain of
reactions, called the pp chain is shown in fig. 3.1 .

The other series of nuclear reactions in the core of the Sun that
release neutrinos is the @xmath cycle. However, since the @xmath cycle
becomes important only above core temperature @xmath K, it produces only
about 1.5% of the total solar neutrinos released. Nevertheless the
@xmath cycle is responsible for three sources of solar neutrinos and we
call them the @xmath , @xmath and @xmath neutrinos. So one has eight
different types of solar neutrinos, five produced in the @xmath chain
and three in the @xmath cycle.

From the observed solar luminosity and from the fact that 28 MeV energy
are released per two electron neutrinos produced in eq. ( 3.1 ), one can
make an order of magnitude estimate of the solar neutrino flux

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.2)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

The exact solar neutrino flux calculations depend on a number of factors
such as the nuclear reactions rates, the metallicity ( @xmath ), the age
of the Sun and the opacity. Detailed solar neutrino flux calculations
from the standard solar models are available [ 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 ,
28 , 29 ] and agree with the rough estimate made in eq. ( 3.2 ) in order
of magnitude. The first two columns of Table 3.1 list the total solar
neutrino fluxes along with their @xmath uncertainties, from the eight
different reactions, as given by the year 2000 model of Bahcall,
Pinsonneault and Basu, which we shall henceforth refer to as BPB00 [ 29
] . In fig. 3.2 we show the energy spectrum of the neutrinos emitted in
various reactions of the @xmath chain in BPB00. Also shown are the
@xmath uncertainties in the various fluxes ¹ ¹ 1 This figure has been
taken from John Bahcall’s homepage; www.sns.ias.edu/ @xmath jnb/ .

Among the predictions for the neutrinos from different reactions in the
Sun, the flux of the @xmath neutrino is the most uncertain. In fact the
largest contribution to the differences in the predictions of the
various standard solar models is their choice of different values for
the @xmath which is the astrophysical @xmath -factor for the reaction
@xmath . While the SSM of Dar and Shaviv [ 27 ] uses a value of @xmath
as low as @xmath eV barn, the earlier 1992 and 1995 models of Bahcall
and Pinsonneault [ 24 , 26 ] had used @xmath eV barn. The value of
@xmath used in BPB00 is @xmath eV barn which is the value accepted by
the Institute of Nuclear Theory (INT) [ 30 ] .

The solar fluxes are sensitive not just to the uncertainties in the
nuclear reaction rates, but also to the value of the core temperature
@xmath . In fact the @xmath flux @xmath , the @xmath flux @xmath while
the @xmath flux @xmath . Hence even a slight increase in the value of
@xmath can seriously affect all the solar fluxes. In particular, it will
sharply raise the @xmath and @xmath fluxes and lower the @xmath flux ² ²
2 This implies that just by adjusting the value of @xmath alone one
cannot solve the SNP since Cl and SK experiment will require a lowering
of @xmath which will raise the @xmath flux making the Ga results look
all the more puzzling. . The value of @xmath is sensitive to a number of
factors including the value of the opacity of the solar core. If the
value of the opacity is raised, it slows down the heat transport,
leading to higher core temperatures. The value of the opacity in turn
depends on the abundance of heavy elements in the Sun or the
metallicity. Another very important ingredient in the solar models is
the inclusion of element diffusion. Apart from convection, the two other
mechanisms important for transporting solar matter are; (1)
gravitational settling, which pulls heavier elements towards the center
and (2) temperature gradient diffusion, which results in pushing lighter
elements outward. Both of these cause the inward diffusion of @xmath and
outward diffusion of @xmath . Hence diffusion increases the opacity,
which results in a higher @xmath leading to an increase of @xmath and
@xmath fluxes and decrease of the @xmath flux.

In spite of the various uncertainties involved, only a fraction of which
have been discussed above, it was shown in [ 24 , 26 ] that if the same
input physics is used, then all the standard solar models agree with one
another to an accuracy of better than 10%. Hence though we have
presented the results on the total fluxes and the neutrino spectra from
the standard solar model of Bahcall, Pinsonneault and Basu, predictions
by almost all the standard models published so far are in reasonable
agreement with each other. For our analysis of the SNP in terms of
neutrino mass and mixing, we have used the latest SSM predictions by
Bahcall, Pinsonneault and Basu (BPB00) [ 29 ] .

#### 3.1.2 The Solar Neutrino Experiments

##### The Cl Experiment (Homestake)

This is the first and the longest running experiment on solar neutrinos
started in the sixties by Davis and his collaborators with 615 tons of
@xmath (perchloroethylene) in the Homestake Gold mine in South Dakota [
1 ] . The neutrino detection process in this experiment is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

The @xmath atoms are extracted from the detectors at the end of a
certain period of time and counted by detecting the Auger electron
released when the @xmath decays by capturing a K-shell or an L-shell
electron. The reaction ( 3.3 ) has a threshold of 0.814 MeV so that the
Cl experiment predominantly detects the @xmath and @xmath neutrinos. It
misses out on the most abundant and least uncertain @xmath neutrinos
which have a maximum energy of only 0.42 MeV (cf. fig 3.2 ). The third
column of Table 3.1 shows the BPB00 predictions [ 29 ] for the neutrino
capture rates in the Cl experiment for the different neutrino sources.
Also shown for the Cl detector are the total predicted rate and the
@xmath uncertainties in the model calculations. The numbers quoted are
in a convenient unit called SNU, defined as, @xmath . The observed rate
of solar neutrinos in the experiment is [ 3 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

Compared to the BPB00 prediction of @xmath as in Table 3.1 , this gives
a ratio of observed to expected SSM rate of @xmath .

##### The Ga Experiments (SAGE, GALLEX, GNO)

These are also radiochemical experiments that use @xmath as their
detector material. The @xmath captures a @xmath to produce @xmath by the
reaction

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

This reaction has a threshold of only 0.233 MeV. Hence the advantage
that this detector has is that it is capable of seeing the @xmath
neutrinos which are responsible for 98.5% of the energy generation of
the Sun. Hence the fact that the Ga detector could detect these
neutrinos confirms the basic postulate of all the solar models, that the
Sun generates its energy through thermonuclear burning. This itself was
a very significant achievement of the Ga detectors.

The SAGE ( S oviet A merican G allium E xperiment) in Russia and GALLEX
( Ga llium Ex periment) in Italy are experiments that use this detection
technique. The SAGE in Baksan Neutrino Observatory uses 60 tons of
metallic @xmath as the target. The @xmath produced is separated and
counted. The observed rate is [ 5 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

The GALLEX is located in the Gran Sasso laboratory in Italy and uses 30
tons of @xmath in the form @xmath solution. The observed neutrino rate
in GALLEX is [ 6 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

The GALLEX has now finished its run and has been upgraded to the GNO ( G
allium N eutrino O bservatory) which has already given results [ 7 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

The combined SAGE and GALLEX+GNO results is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is more than 6 @xmath away from the SSM predicted rate of @xmath
SNU [ 29 ] (cf. Table 3.1 ).

##### The Water @xmatherenkov Experiments (Kamiokande and
Super-Kamiokande)

The water @xmath erenkov detectors detect solar neutrinos by the forward
scattering of electrons

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

As it moves, the scattered electron emits @xmath erenkov light, which is
viewed by the huge number of photomultiplier tubes covering the entire
detector volume. The water detector in general has a higher threshold so
that it is sensitive to just the @xmath and the vanishingly small @xmath
neutrinos. But it has many other advantages. It is a real time
experiment which has directional information. The reaction ( 3.10 ) is
forward peaked and the detector can reconstruct the direction of the
incoming neutrino from the angle of the emitted @xmath erenkov cone.
Earlier the Kamiokande [ 4 ] and now the Super-Kamiokande [ 8 ] have
found an excess of events peaking broadly in the solar direction and
have thus confirmed that the observed neutrinos are indeed coming from
the Sun. The water detector can observe not just the @xmath as in the
radiochemical experiments, but neutrinos and antineutrinos of all
flavors. Thus it can detect @xmath and @xmath through neutral current
electron scattering though the neutral current scattering cross-section
is about @xmath of the charged current scattering cross-section. This is
important if one wants to distinguish between neutrinos oscillating out
into either @xmath or to some @xmath species @xmath , which does not
have any standard model interactions. But the real strength of this
experiment lies in its ability to provide information about the incident
neutrino energy spectrum from the observed recoil electron energy
spectrum. This piece of experimental observation tells us about the form
of the energy dependence of the suppression rate which is extremely
important in distinguishing between allowed solutions to the SNP. Also,
since it is a real time experiment, it can divide its data set into day
and night bins. Hence the detector can give information on the
difference between the observed solar flux during day and night.

The Kamiokande experiment, located in a deep mine at Mozumi, Japan, was
a 4.5 ktons detector with a threshold of 7.5 MeV. The observed solar
neutrino flux reported by this experiment is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

Super-Kamiokande (SK) [ 8 ] is the upgraded version of Kamiokande. The
first result of this experiment on solar neutrinos was released in 1998
[ 8 ] . The SK has now managed to reduce its threshold to 5.0 MeV [ 31 ]
and the observed solar flux reported by SK after 1258 day of data taking
is [ 31 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

The recoil electron energy spectrum [ 9 ] released by the SK
collaboration after 1258 day of data [ 31 ] is consistent with no
spectral distortion. This means that the suppression rate observed is
essentially energy independent. The SK gives not just the total recoil
energy spectrum but also the spectrum at day and the spectrum at night.
In fig 3.3 we show the day and the night spectra separately for the 1258
day SK data. We can see that both the day and the night spectra are flat
upto @xmath . The night bins have slightly more events than the day
bins. The degree of difference between the day and night event rates is
conveniently measured by the day-night asymmetry, defined as @xmath and
@xmath , where @xmath is the observed flux during night(day). The SK
reports [ 31 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is just a @xmath effect which signifies almost no day-night
asymmetry.

In order to study the day-night effect in greater details, the SK divide
their data on total rates into a day and five night bins according to
the zenith angle at which the neutrinos arrive [ 10 , 31 ] . They have
now also divided their observed spectrum into zenith angle bins [ 31 ] .
This helps to study the energy dependence of the suppression rate as
well as the predicted day night asymmetry together in the most efficient
manner.

The Sun-Earth distance changes with the time of the year due to the
eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit. If the neutrinos oscillate in vacuum
on their way from the Sun to Earth, then one should expect an extra
modulation of the solar neutrino flux due to oscillations with the time
of the year, as the survival probability depends very crucially on the
distance that the neutrinos travel. The SK have reported the seasonal
variation of the solar flux. The data is consistent with the expected
annual variation due to orbital eccentricity of the Earth assuming no
neutrino oscillations.

##### The Heavy Water Detector (SNO)

The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory at Sudbury, Canada is the worlds first
heavy water detector containing 1 kton of pure @xmath surrounded by 7
kton of pure @xmath . The main detection process is the charged current
(CC) breakup of the deuteron

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

It has now declared its first results on the observed @xmath flux [ 11 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

The detector threshold for the kinetic energy of the observed electron
released in ( 3.14 ) is 6.75 MeV. SNO has also released its observed
@xmath flux measured by the electron scattering (ES) reaction (cf. eq. (
3.10 )) and they report [ 11 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

which agrees with the SK observation ( 3.12 ), though the errors are
still large. Apart from the total rates, SNO also gives the recoil
electron energy spectrum for the CC events and they do not report any
significant distortion with energy. However the real strength of this
detector is its ability to measure the flux of all the neutrino species
with equal cross-section via the neutral current (NC) breakup of
deuteron

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

The observed NC rate from SNO is being eagerly awaited. Implications of
the NC rate for the mass and mixing parameters is discussed in detail in
[ 32 ] .

##### Summary of the Experimental Results

In order to summarize the main results available from all the solar
neutrino experiments, we present in Table 3.2 the ratio of the observed
to the expected total rates ³ ³ 3 From now onwards we shall call these
ratios as the observed rates. in the Ga, Cl, SK and SNO experiments ⁴ ⁴
4 We choose to neglect the Kamiokande data since the Kamiokande
observations are consistent with the SK data which has much higher
statistics. . The corresponding rough estimates for the compositions of
the observed flux is also shown. Since the ES rate in SK and SNO is
sensitive to both @xmath as well as @xmath , we show in brackets
separately the @xmath contribution to the observed rate assuming @xmath
oscillations. We note that the observed rate have a strong nonmonotonic
dependence on the neutrino energy since the Ga experiments which see the
lowest energy @xmath have the highest rate, the Cl experiment observes
intermediate energy neutrinos and reports the lowest rate, while the SK
and SNO which are sensitive to the highest energy neutrinos, have a rate
that is intermediate between the Ga and Cl rates.

In sharp contrast to the strong nonmonotonic energy dependence exhibited
by the data on total rates, the recent SK data on the energy spectra at
day and night show no evidence for any energy dependence. The SNO is
also consistent with no spectral distortion, however the errorbars for
the SNO spectrum is still high. Hence there is an apparent conflict
between the total rates and the SK spectrum data since the former would
prefer solutions with strong nonmonotonic energy dependence while the
latter would favor solutions with relatively weak dependence on energy.
In addition the SK data is consistent with little or no day-night
asymmetry which we shall see rules out large parts of the parameter
space which predict strong Earth matter effects.

#### 3.1.3 The Solar Neutrino Code

We perform a dedicated analysis of the global solar neutrino data on the
total observed rate and the SK day-night recoil electron energy
spectrum. This takes into account all available independent experimental
features of the solar neutrino data. We take the rates from the Cl, Ga
(SAGE and GALLEX+GNO combined), SK and SNO CC experiments. The SNO ES
data is not incorporated as it has large error. We also leave out the
SNO CC spectrum for the same reason. We do not incorporate the
Kamiokande rate as discussed before. We use the @xmath minimization
technique to determine the best-fit parameters and draw the C.L.
contours. For the statistical analysis for the total rates we define the
@xmath function as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the theoretical prediction of the event rate for the
@xmath experiment and @xmath is the corresponding observed value shown
in Table 3.2 . The error matrix @xmath contains the experimental errors,
the theoretical errors and their correlations. For the evaluation of the
error matrix @xmath we have followed the procedure given in [ 33 ] .

The expected event rate for the radiochemical experiments Cl and Ga in
presence of oscillations is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the capture cross section for the @xmath detector,
@xmath is the detector threshold, @xmath is the neutrino survival
probability averaged over the distribution of the neutrino production
region inside the Sun, @xmath is the neutrino spectrum from the @xmath
source inside the Sun and the sum is over all the eight sources. For the
SK experiment the corresponding event rate is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the normalized @xmath neutrino spectrum, @xmath is the
true and @xmath the apparent(measured) kinetic energy of the recoil
electrons, @xmath is the detector threshold energy which is 5.0 MeV and
R( @xmath , @xmath ) is the energy resolution function which is taken as
[ 34 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.21)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.22)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

In eq. ( 3.20 ) @xmath is the time averaged @xmath survival probability,
@xmath is the time averaged transition probability from @xmath to @xmath
, where @xmath is either @xmath or @xmath , @xmath is the differential
cross section for ( @xmath ) scattering while @xmath is the
corresponding cross section for ( @xmath ) scattering. Note that if one
has @xmath transitions involved the second term will be absent and only
the @xmath contribution to the scattering rate will survive.

For the @xmath CC event rate in SNO we use

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.23)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.24)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

For SNO @xmath MeV, where @xmath is the mass of the electron and d
@xmath /dE @xmath is the differential cross section of the @xmath
interaction. One of the major uncertainties in the SNO CC measurement
stems from the uncertainty in the @xmath cross-section. We use the
cross-sections from [ 35 ] which are in agreement with [ 36 ] . Both
calculations give an uncertainty of 3% which is also the value quoted in
[ 11 ] ⁵ ⁵ 5 It was recently pointed out in [ 37 ] that the calculation
of both [ 35 ] and [ 36 ] underestimate the total @xmath cross-section
by 6%. We have not included this effect in our calculation. . @xmath for
SNO is given by the same functional form ( 3.21 ) with the @xmath given
as [ 11 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.25)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

For the analysis of the day-night effect and the energy behavior of the
suppression rate we define a @xmath function for the SK 1258 day
day-night recoil electron energy spectra as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are the theoretically calculated predictions for the @xmath
energy bin, normalized to BPB00, @xmath are the corresponding observed
values and the sum is over 19 day + 19 night energy bins provided by SK.
The error matrix for the spectrum analysis is defined as in [ 38 ] . In
eq. ( 3.26 ) @xmath is an overall normalization constant which is
allowed to vary freely in the analysis. The SK provides information
about three aspects of the solar neutrino flux suppression, (i) the
overall suppression rate, (ii) the energy dependence of the suppression
and (iii) the effect of Earth matter on the suppression rate. The
information about the overall @xmath flux observed by SK is embodied
both in the total rate and in the spectrum data. Since we have already
accounted for this piece of information in the @xmath we avoid the
double counting of the total suppression rate in @xmath by introducing
this floating normalization @xmath . Thus the SK day-night spectrum data
provides information on only the presence of energy distortion, if any.
It gives information on the the day-night asymmetry as well.

For the global analysis we take into account the data on total rates as
well the SK day-night spectrum data and define our total @xmath as
@xmath . If we assume no new property for the neutrino and use the flux
predictions from BPB00, then the value of @xmath which is definitely
unacceptable. Even if the constraints on the solar models is relaxed, so
that one allows the fluxes to take on any arbitrary value subject to the
solar luminosity constraint, the fit is extremely poor if all the three
experiments are considered together. The data cannot be explained by
this approach, even if one takes only two experiments at a time. In fact
as discussed in the introduction, all such fits predict “missing @xmath
neutrinos”. This happens because the Ga observed flux can be almost
accounted for by the @xmath and @xmath fluxes alone, given the
luminosity constraint. If simultaneously the observations of the water
@xmath erenkov experiments are to be accounted for, then there is an
extra contribution from the @xmath flux in Ga leaving no room for the
@xmath flux. If on the other hand one considers Cl and SK together, then
the expected @xmath flux in the former from the observation of the
@xmath flux in the latter, more than compensates the observed rate in
Cl, again demanding complete suppression of @xmath [ 39 ] . With the
advent of the SNO CC result the astrophysical solution gets
comprehensively ruled out [ 13 ] . Thus one has to invoke some new
property for the neutrinos beyond the standard model of particle physics
in order to solve the solar neutrino problem. We probe the viability of
neutrino mass and flavor mixing as a possible explanation of this
discrepancy.

We first find the best-fit solution to the data on only the total rates
by minimizing @xmath . Next we take into account the global data on
rates as well as the SK day-night spectrum data so that our total @xmath
is @xmath . We minimize this @xmath for @xmath oscillations keeping the
@xmath flux normalization in the total rates fixed at the SSM
prediction. We repeat the entire analysis for @xmath oscillations. For
both these neutrino flavor mixing analyses we adopt a unified approach
to which we turn our attention next.

#### 3.1.4 Unified Formalism for Analysis of Solar Data

The general expression for the probability amplitude of survival for an
electron neutrino produced in the deep interior of the Sun, for two
neutrino flavors, is given by [ 40 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath gives the probability amplitude of @xmath transition at the
solar surface, @xmath is the survival amplitude from the solar surface
to the surface of the Earth and @xmath denotes the @xmath transition
amplitudes inside the Earth. We can express

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the phase picked up by the neutrinos on their way from
the production point in the central regions to the surface of the Sun
and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the mixing angle at the production point of the neutrino
and is given by eq. ( 2.34 ) for transitions to active and by eq. ( 2.51
) for transitions to sterile neutrinos, @xmath is the non-adiabatic jump
probability given by eq. ( 2.47 ) which for the exponential density
profile of the Sun can be conveniently expressed as [ 41 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.30)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.31)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The survival amplitude @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the energy of the state @xmath , @xmath is the distance
between the center of the Sun and Earth and @xmath is the solar radius.
For a two-slab model of the Earth — a mantle and core with constant
densities of 4.5 and 11.5 gm cm @xmath respectively, the expression for
@xmath can be written as (assuming the flavor states to be continuous
across the boundaries) [ 42 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.33)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where ( @xmath ) denotes mass eigenstates and ( @xmath ) denotes flavor
eigenstates, @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are the mixing matrices in
vacuum, in the mantle and the core respectively and @xmath and @xmath
are the corresponding phases picked up by the neutrinos as they travel
through the mantle and the core of the Earth. The @xmath survival
probability is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.34)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Identifying @xmath and @xmath eq. ( 3.34 ) can be expressed as [ 40 , 43
, 44 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.35)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where we have combined all the phases involved in the Sun, vacuum and
inside Earth in @xmath . This is the most general expression for
survival probability for the unified analysis of solar neutrino data.
Depending on the value of @xmath one recovers the well known
Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) [ 16 , 17 ] and vacuum oscillation
(VO) [ 1 ] limits:

@xmath In the regime @xmath eV @xmath /MeV matter effects inside the Sun
suppress flavor transitions and @xmath . Therefore, from ( 3.29 ), we
obtain @xmath as the propagation of neutrinos is extremely non-adiabatic
and likewise, @xmath to give

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

@xmath For @xmath eV @xmath /MeV, the total oscillation phase becomes
very large and the @xmath term in eq. ( 3.35 ) averages out to zero. One
then recovers the usual MSW survival probability

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

@xmath In between the pure vacuum oscillation regime where the matter
effects can be safely neglected, and the pure MSW zone where the
coherence effects due to the phase @xmath can be conveniently
disregarded, is a region where both effects can contribute. For @xmath
eV @xmath /MeV @xmath eV @xmath /MeV, both matter effects inside the Sun
and coherent oscillation effects in the vacuum become important. This is
the quasi vacuum oscillation (QVO) regime [ 40 , 45 ] . In this region,
@xmath and @xmath and the survival probability is given by [ 43 , 46 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

We calculate @xmath in this region using the prescription given in [ 46
] .

##### Day-Night Effect

For the the range of @xmath for which matter effects inside the Earth
are important (the pure MSW regime), one expects a significant day-night
asymmetry. During day time the neutrinos do not cross the Earth and
@xmath is simply the projection of the @xmath state onto the @xmath
state. Hence the @xmath survival probability during day is simply

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

The probability during night is given by the full expression ( 3.37 ).
If one factors out @xmath in the complete expression ( 3.37 ) which
includes the Earth matter effects then ⁶ ⁶ 6 Note that for the purpose
of simplicity of presentation we show the expressions where the phases
have been averaged out to zero. However for the actual calculation of
the probabilities we use the unified expression ( 3.35 ).

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . From eq. ( 3.39 ) and ( 3.40 ) we see that the extra
contribution coming due to the matter effects inside the Earth is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is the total regeneration of @xmath inside the Earth which we shall
call @xmath . For convenience we shall define the regeneration factor

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the absence of any Earth matter effects, @xmath and so @xmath and we
get back @xmath from eq. ( 3.40 ). We also note that (with @xmath )

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.43)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

In other words the above factor quantifies the amount of level crossing
due to loss of adiabaticity at resonance. The Earth regeneration now can
be conveniently expressed as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.44)
              @xmath   @xmath      (3.45)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Hence from eq. ( 3.44 ) and ( 3.45 ) we see that the @xmath regeneration
inside the Earth depends on

1.   The adiabatic factor @xmath : @xmath is maximum for @xmath ,
    decreases with increasing @xmath , hits the minimum ( @xmath ) for
    @xmath and changes sign for @xmath . Which means that for @xmath we
    have further depletion of @xmath as they pass through the Earth.

2.   The value of @xmath : We can see from eq. ( 2.34 ) that @xmath if
    the resonance density is more than the density at which the
    neutrinos are produced, @xmath if the neutrinos are produced at the
    position of resonance and @xmath if the resonance density becomes
    less than the production density. As the resonance density decreases
    @xmath decreases and reaches the value @xmath . As the value of
    @xmath decreases the position of resonance for the solar neutrinos
    shifts further outward and the value of @xmath approaches @xmath .
    Thus for the LOW solution @xmath for almost all neutrinos energies
    and one gets maximum regeneration for the LOW solution.

3.   The regeneration factor: The net regeneration due to Earth matter
    effects depends crucially on the value of @xmath which determines
    quantitatively the actual effect of Earth matter.

In fig 3.4 we show the Earth regeneration @xmath as a function of @xmath
for three values of the mixing angle in the range @xmath . We note that
the Earth matter effects are important only for @xmath eV @xmath eV
@xmath which is the “pure” MSW regime and peaks at @xmath eV @xmath .
Since around @xmath MeV the SK day-night data allows for very small
day-night asymmetry, most of regions around @xmath eV @xmath for large
mixing angles are disfavored. In fig 3.5 we show the regeneration factor
@xmath and the total Earth regeneration @xmath vs energy at the SK
latitude for typical values of the parameters in the SMA, LMA and
LOW-QVO regimes. Since the latitude of the other detectors are not very
different we do not expect @xmath and @xmath to be very different for
them. Noteworthy point is that while the regeneration factor @xmath is
positive for all the three cases considered, @xmath turns out to be
negative for the SMA case. This is because for the SMA solution @xmath ,
or in other words @xmath , signifying large level crossing from the
@xmath to the @xmath state in the solar matter at resonance. On the
other hand for the LMA and LOW solutions the neutrino moves
adiabatically inside the Sun, the @xmath produced in the @xmath state
remains in a @xmath state throughout and @xmath , so that @xmath . Thus
for both LMA and LOW solutions one has positive regeneration of @xmath
inside the Earth, the effect being more for the latter since for low
@xmath all the neutrinos resonate far away from the production zone and
@xmath is closer to -1. Also note that for the LOW solution the
regeneration is important at low energies while LMA has more
regeneration for higher energy neutrinos.

We finally present in fig 3.6 the actual survival probability @xmath vs
energy during day (shown by dotted lines), during night (shown by dashed
lines) and the day-night average (shown by solid lines) for SMA, LMA and
LOW case. In order to understand the nature of the probabilities we call
@xmath and note that:

@xmath For the SMA region @xmath and from fig. 3.5 we observe that
@xmath is very small excepting for two peaks at E @xmath 6 MeV and E
@xmath 15 MeV corresponding to strong enhancement of the earth
regeneration effect for the neutrinos passing through the core [ 47 , 42
] . Hence

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this region for low energy ( @xmath ) neutrinos, resonance is not
encountered (resonance density @xmath maximum solar density) and hence
@xmath and @xmath giving @xmath . For intermediate energy ( @xmath )
neutrinos @xmath (resonance density @xmath production density) and
@xmath for these energies. For high energy ( @xmath ) neutrinos also,
@xmath and @xmath , with @xmath rising with energy.

@xmath For the LMA solution the motion of the neutrino in the solar
matter is adiabatic for almost all neutrino energies and @xmath . For
low energy neutrinos the matter effects are weak both inside the Sun and
in Earth giving @xmath and @xmath so that for Ga energies [ 48 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

At SK and SNO energies matter effects result in @xmath while @xmath is
small but non-zero ( @xmath 0.03 at 10 MeV as seen from fig. 3.5 )
giving

#### 3.1.5 Results and Discussions

We present in Table 3.3 the results of the @xmath analysis for @xmath
oscillations, using data from the Cl, Ga, SK and SNO ⁷ ⁷ 7 We
incorporate only the SNO CC rate as the SNO ES rate and the SNO CC
spectrum still have large errors. experiments. We use the total rates
given in Table 3.2 and the 1258 day SK recoil electron energy spectrum
at day and night. We show the best-fit values of the parameters @xmath
and @xmath , @xmath and the goodness of fit (GOF) for the SMA, LMA,
LOW-QVO, VO and Just So @xmath [ 49 ] solutions.

The best-fit for the only rates analysis comes in the VO region which is
favored at 28.79%. Prior to SNO the SMA solution could explain the
nonmonotonic energy dependence of the survival probability from the Cl,
Ga and SK experiments well and was the best-fit solution. But with the
advent of SNO it falls into disfavor and is allowed at only 6.59%. For
the LMA solution on the other hand the survival probability is given by
eqs. ( 3.47 ) and ( 3.48 ) at Ga and SK/SNO energies respectively and
for the values of @xmath from Table 3.3 and @xmath given in fig. 3.5 ,
it approximately reproduces the rates of Table 3.2 . LMA is allowed at
18.27% while LOW-QVO is barely allowed at 1.55%. In fact the LOW
solution gets allowed only due to the strong Earth regeneration effects
at low energies which helps the LOW solution to explain the Ga data
better. In addition to these four solutions we have a fifth solution
called the Just So @xmath solution [ 49 ] at @xmath eV @xmath . For
these @xmath one gets a very small survival probability for the @xmath
neutrinos while for the @xmath neutrinos the survival probability is
close to 1.0 [ 50 ] . Therefore it cannot explain the total rates data.

We next perform a complete global analysis of the solar neutrino data
taking the four total rates and the 1258 day SK day-night recoil
electron spectrum data. We present in Table 3.3 the results obtained by
minimizing @xmath . We get five allowed solutions LMA, VO, LOW, SMA and
Just So @xmath in order of decreasing GOF. The LMA solution can
approximately reproduce the rates as discussed above and since the
survival probability ( 3.48 ) for SK is approximately energy independent
it can account for the flat recoil electron energy spectrum. LMA thus
gives the best-fit being allowed at 72.18%. The LOW solution with
best-fit @xmath and @xmath for Ga and @xmath for SK energies (cf. fig.
3.5 ) can just about reconcile the Ga and SK rates. However it provides
a very good description of the flat SK spectrum and is allowed at
46.99%. The VO solution at @xmath eV @xmath gives a very low @xmath for
the spectrum data and hence the overall fit for VO is very good. However
for the SMA solution there is a mismatch between the parameters that
give the minimum @xmath for the rates data and the spectrum data. The
spectrum data prefers value of @xmath which are one order of magnitude
lower than those preferred by the rates data. Thus the overall fit in
the SMA region suffers and it is allowed at only 9.22%. The Just So
@xmath solution is very bad for the rates but since it gives a flat
probability for the @xmath neutrinos the spectrum shape can be accounted
for and the global analysis gives a GOF of 8.1%.

In fig. 3.7 we show the 90%, 95%, 99% and 99.73% C.L. allowed areas from
the analysis of the data on total rates (shown in the left hand panel)
and the combined data on rates and the SK spectrum (shown in the right
hand panel). For the only rates case we have allowed areas in the SMA,
LMA, LOW-QVO and VO regions. For the global analysis we get allowed
zones in the LMA and the LOW-QVO zones. In the VO region we get just two
small areas which are allowed. But the most significant feature is the
disappearance of the SMA solution from the global fit even at 99.73%
C.L. ( @xmath ).

We have repeated the entire analysis for the @xmath case and have
reported the results of the fit in Table 3.4 . We find that after the
inclusion of the SNO data, all the solutions are disfavored with a
probability of more than 99% from the total rates analysis while for the
global analysis the GOF of these become much worse.

### 3.2 The Atmospheric Neutrino Anomaly

The atmospheric neutrinos are produced due to the collision of cosmic
rays ( @xmath ) with the nuclei in the atmosphere ( @xmath ) resulting
in a chain of reactions which culminates in the production of neutrinos
and antineutrinos with expected flavor ratio of roughly @xmath .

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.50)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.51)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The first pioneering measurement of events induced by these neutrinos
were made in the Kolar Gold Fields in India [ 51 ] and almost
simultaneously in South Africa [ 52 ] . But the interpretation of the
results from these experiments remained ambiguous due to both
theoretical as well as experimental uncertainties. It was only since
late eighties that people earnestly started pursuing this problem [ 53 ,
54 , 55 , 56 , 57 , 58 ] and around 1988 Kamiokande, which was
originally designed to detect proton decay, declared its results on
atmospheric neutrino measurements which showed a marked deficit of
observed to expected @xmath ratio [ 53 ] . This embodies the Atmospheric
Neutrino Anomaly . This was the second evidence of missing neutrinos
after the solar neutrino problem and again called for the existence of
neutrino mass and mixing for the correct interpretation of the
experimental results.

However due to the large theoretical and experimental uncertainties
involved in the atmospheric neutrino measurement, it failed to prove
itself as a compelling evidence of neutrino oscillations until the
arrival of the Super-Kamiokande atmospheric results in 1998 [ 58 ] . The
SK atmospheric neutrino data [ 58 , 59 , 60 ] not only confirmed the
suppression of the muon type neutrinos, it also firmly established the
fact that the observed deficit has a zenith angle dependence. That is,
the neutrinos coming at larger zenith angles and hence traveling
distances of the order of the diameter of the Earth were suppressed more
compared to neutrinos arriving directly from the top of the detector.
This differential depletion of the atmospheric @xmath flux is referred
to as the observed up-down asymmetry . The @xmath events on the other
hand are reported to be consistent with theoretical expectations.

The most convincing particle physics scenario which can explain all
aspects of the SK data is @xmath oscillations with @xmath eV @xmath and
@xmath [ 61 , 62 , 63 , 64 ] . Thus the theory of neutrino mass and
mixing, which was conjectured in the late sixties as a plausible
solution to the solar neutrino problem, was established as an accepted
reality by the SK atmospheric neutrino results in 1998. This observation
of neutrino mass by the SK (although indirect) is the first and till
date the only evidence of physics beyond the standard model of particle
physics.

The observed depletion of atmospheric neutrinos was also reported by the
IMB [ 55 ] earlier and more recently by the Soudan2 [ 65 ] and MACRO [
66 ] collaborations ⁸ ⁸ 8 The Frejus [ 56 ] and Nusex [ 57 ] experiments
though were consistent with no deficit of atmospheric neutrinos. . In
order to do justice to all these experiments one should perform a global
analysis taking all the experimental data into account. However due to
its overwhelming statistics, the SK data dictates the atmospheric
neutrino analysis, with the other experiments having little impact on
the fit and the allowed parameter regions. Hence considering the rich
statistics and low systematics of the SK, we choose to work with just
the SK data in our analysis of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly and
perform dedicated @xmath -fits to the SK 1144 day data. We describe two
different established methods of @xmath analysis of the atmospheric data
and discuss their merits and demerits, present the best-fit @xmath and
@xmath and display the 90% and 99% C.L. allowed zones in the @xmath -
@xmath parameter space for two-generation @xmath oscillations.

In section 3.2.1 we give an essence of the atmospheric neutrino flux
calculations and the theoretical uncertainties associated with it. In
section 3.2.2 we discuss the various features of the SK atmospheric
experiment and state the main experimental results. In section 3.2.3 we
describe our atmospheric neutrino code and discuss the advantages and
disadvantages of the two methods of @xmath analysis that we have used.
Finally in section 3.2.4 we present the results of our @xmath fits.

#### 3.2.1 Atmospheric Neutrino Flux Predictions

Atmospheric neutrinos are the result of a cascade of reactions following
the interaction of the cosmic rays with the air nuclei (cf. eq. ( 3.50
), ( 3.51 )). In the decay chain ( 3.51 ), for every electron neutrino
(or antineutrino) created one has two muon type neutrinos (or
antineutrinos) ⁹ ⁹ 9 For the purpose of discussion we shall henceforth
use the term neutrino to mean both neutrino as well as antineutrino
though for the actual calculation they are treated differently.
produced. Thus one may naively guess that the ratio of fluxes

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.52)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

But for a realistic prediction for the atmospheric neutrino fluxes one
needs to fold in the cosmic ray fluxes with the hadronic interaction
model, which takes into account the complete reaction chain and perform
a comprehensive calculation. Two such widely used atmospheric flux
calculations are by Honda et al. [ 67 ] and Agarwal et al. [ 68 ] .

The primary cosmic rays which are the main ingredient of the atmospheric
neutrino flux calculations have large uncertainties in their over all
normalization, composition, as well as in their spectrum, all of which
are extremely crucial in the atmospheric neutrino flux calculations.
Though the cosmic ray fluxes are relatively well known at @xmath GeV
(these give rise to the sub-GeV atmospheric neutrino fluxes), there are
few experimental measurements for the higher energy cosmic rays ( @xmath
GeV which result in multi-GeV neutrino fluxes) and hence this regime is
plagued with large uncertainties.

The resultant atmospheric neutrino fluxes also depend crucially on the
hadronic interaction model. In their calculation, Honda et al. use a
full Monte Carlo method for the sub-GeV neutrinos while for the
multi-GeV fluxes they employ a “hybrid model” [ 67 ] . They make their
atmospheric neutrino flux calculations using a one-dimensional
approximation where they assume that all the secondary particles
including the mesons and the leptons are collinear with the incident
primary cosmic ray. Though this approximation works well for the higher
energy calculations, it fails for the low energy sub-GeV fluxes,
particularly for the horizontal zenith angles and therefore should be
replaced by a full three-dimensional calculation [ 69 ] .

Let us next discuss some of the most important factors which affect the
atmospheric neutrino flux predictions.

1.   The solar activity : The effect of the solar wind on the cosmic
    rays entering the solar sphere of influence is to deviate their
    trajectories away from the Earth. This affects the low energy cosmic
    rays more than the higher energy ones and is known as the solar
    modulation of the cosmic ray fluxes. Since the solar wind depends on
    the solar activity, the fluxes are maximum at the solar minimum and
    minimum at the solar maximum.

2.   The geomagnetic field : Since the cosmic rays consist of charged
    particles they experience a repulsion due to the Earth’s magnetic
    field and may be deflected away. Hence only particles with momentum
    above a certain threshold can break this barrier and enter the
    Earth’s atmosphere. This threshold is called the rigidity cut off
    and is defined as, rigidity=momentum/charge. This effect results in
    cutting off the lower energy cosmic rays which affects the low
    energy neutrino fluxes. The geomagnetic field bends the cosmic rays
    and thus introduces a directionality into the atmospheric fluxes,
    the effect obviously being more for lower energy neutrinos. This
    effect of the geomagnetic field results in predicting more neutrino
    flux from the west than from the east and is known as the east-west
    effect . SK has made observations of this predicted east-west
    anisotropy and has confirmed this estimated directional behavior [
    70 ] .

3.   The density structure of the atmosphere: Once the pions and kaons
    are produced in the air, they may either decay creating muons and
    neutrinos or may interact with other particles. Which of these
    processes dominate is dictated by the energy of the meson and decay
    becomes comparable to interaction when

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (3.53)
      -- -------- -- --------

    where @xmath is the rest frame lifetime of the meson of energy
    @xmath and mass m, @xmath is the interaction cross-section with air
    and @xmath is the number density of the air nuclei. Since the
    interaction rate depends inversely on the density of the atmosphere,
    and since the cosmic rays moving along the horizontal zenith angle
    interact with the air nuclei at a higher altitude (and hence lower
    density), the decay probability for these is more compared to
    interaction. Hence the resultant neutrino fluxes are maximum along
    the horizontal and minimum along the vertical directions. This gives
    rise to the zenith angle variation of the neutrino flux. Again,
    because the interaction rate of the meson is determined by its
    energy, the zenith angle dependence of the neutrino flux increases
    with energy.

4.   Decay lifetime of the mesons: The ratio @xmath only for @xmath
    decays at rest for which the decay ( 3.51 ) is complete. However
    above @xmath GeV the decay lifetime of the produced muon becomes so
    large that they fail to decay in air. This results in raising the
    value of @xmath from 2. Again, as the effective atmospheric depth
    along the horizontal direction is more than that along the vertical,
    the decay chain ( 3.51 ) has comparatively a better chance of
    completion along the horizontal direction and this results in
    endowing @xmath with a zenith angle dependence.

Though the uncertainty due to primary cosmic rays for the sub-GeV
neutrinos is small, they are significantly modulated by the solar
activity and the geomagnetic field. Being low in energy, they have less
zenith angle dependence. The multi-GeV fluxes on the other hand have
less dependence on solar activity and geomagnetic field, but have large
zenith angle variation and have to contend with huge cosmic ray
uncertainties. We show in fig 3.8 the atmospheric neutrino flux
predictions by Honda et al. [ 67 ] as a function of the zenith angle for
three typical values of energies. Also shown in the lower panels are the
corresponding values of @xmath . The fluxes shown are without the
geomagnetic effects so that they are symmetric about the horizontal and
hence the sign of @xmath is not important. We note that both @xmath as
well as @xmath decrease along the vertical, displaying the zenith angle
behavior discussed above, the effect being more for the @xmath . Thus
the ratio @xmath gets raised from the often quoted value of 2 along the
vertical. The above effect is seen to intensify with energy.

Among the major uncertainties involved in the atmospheric flux
calculations, the most important contribution comes from the lack of
correct estimates for the cosmic ray flux normalization, composition and
spectrum. This results in about @xmath error in the sub-GeV fluxes and
20% error in the multi-GeV flux range. The hadronic interaction model
brings about 10% uncertainty above 300 MeV. The other sources of
uncertainties include the method of calculation employed and the use of
one-dimensional approximation. All these factors sum up to result in
total uncertainty of about 20–30% in the absolute values of the fluxes [
67 ] . For the ratio @xmath on the other hand the uncertainties due to
the primary cosmic rays and the error in the calculation scheme cancel
out and one has only about 5% error for the sub-GeV and about 10% error
for the multi-GeV neutrinos [ 67 ] .

#### 3.2.2 Results from the Super-Kamiokande

The Super-Kamiokande as described before is a large water @xmath
erenkov detector. It contains 50 kton of ultra pure water, divided into
two concentric cylinders. The inner detector with a fiducial volume of
22.5 ktons, has its surface lined by 11,146 inward facing 50cm
photomultiplier tubes and 1885 outward facing 20cm photomultiplier
tubes. The outward facing phototubes view the outer detector volume
which serves both as a particle shield as well as a detector. The main
process by which it detects the atmospheric neutrinos is the charged
current quasi-elastic interaction

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the flavor of the incident neutrino is tagged onto the flavor of
the released lepton. As this lepton moves in water it emits a @xmath
erenkov cone which can be viewed by the phototubes lining the detector
walls. The SK classifies its data into

-   @xmath type or @xmath type events : The single-ring events can be
    classified into @xmath or @xmath type depending on whether the
    observed @xmath erenkov ring is fuzzy or sharp respectively.

-    contained events: Events for which the products of neutrino
    interaction are contained within the detector volume are called
    contained events. If the products are fully contained within the
    inner detector volume itself, then these events are termed
    fully-contained events (FC). On the other hand if the produced
    leptons exit the inner detector volume and stop in the outer
    detector, then these events are called partially-contained events
    (PC). Only muons are penetrating enough to be able enter the outer
    detector and so only @xmath have PC events.

-    sub-GeV and multi-GeV events: Depending on the value of the visible
    energy of the released lepton ( @xmath ) the FC events are
    categorized as sub-GeV (if @xmath GeV) or multi-GeV (if @xmath GeV).

-    upward-going muons: If the muons are produced in the rock below the
    detector and penetrate into the detector volume, then such events
    are grouped together to be called upward-going muons [ 71 ] . If
    these muons traverse the entire detector volume and escape out then
    they are termed as upward through-going muons . If on the other hand
    they stop within the detector then one has upward stopping muons .
    These upward-going muons are recorded for zenith angle @xmath only.
    The neutrino induced muons with zenith angle less than this are not
    taken into account due the huge contamination resulting from the
    muons in the cosmic ray fluxes themselves.

-    zenith angle bins: At the detector, the neutrino flux come from all
    directions. Thus, the total path length between the production point
    in the atmosphere and the detector varies from about 10 km to 13,000
    km depending on the zenith angle. Neutrinos with zenith angle less
    than @xmath ( downward neutrinos ) travel a distance of @xmath 10 –
    100 km from their production point in the atmosphere to the detector
    while the neutrinos with larger zenith angles ( upward neutrinos )
    cross a distance of up to @xmath 13,000 km to reach the detector.
    The SK can see the zenith angle of the lepton that emits the @xmath
    erenkov cone. The lepton zenith angle @xmath is related to the
    incoming neutrino zenith angle @xmath through the relation

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (3.55)
      -- -------- -- --------

    where @xmath is the angle between the incoming neutrino @xmath and
    the scattered lepton @xmath and @xmath is the azimuthal angle
    corresponding to the incident neutrino direction. The SK divides its
    events into bins corresponding to the zenith angle of the observed
    lepton @xmath .

After 1144 day of data taking [ 72 ] the SK divide their observed number
of sub-GeV and multi-GeV @xmath type and @xmath type events into 10
zenith angle bins each. Instead of showing the actual number of events
reported by SK, for the sake of clarity we present in fig 3.9 the ratio
of the number of observed ( @xmath ) to the number of expected ( @xmath
) events, for the sub-GeV @xmath -type ( @xmath ), multi-GeV @xmath
-type ( @xmath ), sub-GeV @xmath -type ( @xmath ) and multi-GeV @xmath
-type ( @xmath ) data samples. We have included the PC events along with
the FC @xmath events in the panel for @xmath . Henceforth we will follow
this procedure for representation of the PC and @xmath data samples. The
ratio @xmath are shown for the ten zenith angle bins along with the
@xmath errorbars.

Had there been no anomaly this ratio would have been one for all the
data bins. However we observe that

1.  The @xmath -type events, both @xmath and @xmath , are consistent
    with theoretical expectations.

2.  The observed @xmath -type events on the other hand show depletion
    compared to expectations.

3.  The deficit of @xmath -type events has a zenith angle distribution.
    The @xmath depletion being most in the first zenith angle bin
    (upward) and least in the last one (downward), for both the @xmath
    and @xmath data samples. Thus the data has a marked up-down
    asymmetry.

4.  In addition the @xmath deficit has an energy dependence. The up-down
    asymmetry being more for the multi-GeV than for the sub-GeV
    neutrinos.

Since the uncertainties in the absolute fluxes are immense ( @xmath ),
one may instead use the double ratio,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are the ratio of the total number of observed @xmath -type
to @xmath -type events in the detector and @xmath is the corresponding
Monte Carlo expectation. Different atmospheric flux calculations agree
to within better than 5% on the magnitude of this quantity. The up-down
asymmetry can be then expressed in terms of an up-down asymmetry
parameter @xmath defined as [ 64 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here @xmath denotes the number of @xmath -type events produced in the
detector with zenith angle @xmath , i.e. the upward neutrino events
while @xmath denotes the number of @xmath -type events for @xmath i.e.
events coming from downward neutrinos. The central bin has contributions
from both upward and downward neutrinos and is not useful for studying
the up-down asymmetry. For the 848 day and 535 day data the @xmath and
@xmath are given in Table 3.5 . The @xmath is close to 1 but the @xmath
and @xmath are less than unity for both the sub-GeV as well multi-GeV
cases.

#### 3.2.3 The Atmospheric Neutrino Code

The expected number of @xmath (e or @xmath ) like 1 ring events recorded
in the detector in presence of oscillations is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.58)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where @xmath denotes the number of target nucleons, @xmath is the
neutrino energy, @xmath is the energy of the final charged lepton,
@xmath is the angle between the incoming neutrino @xmath and the
scattered lepton @xmath , @xmath is the zenith angle of the neutrino and
@xmath is the azimuthal angle corresponding to the incident neutrino
direction (the azimuthal angle relative to the @xmath has been
integrated out). The zenith angle of the charged lepton in terms of
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath is given by eq. ( 3.55 ). @xmath is the
differential flux of atmospheric neutrinos of type @xmath , @xmath is
the differential cross section for @xmath scattering and @xmath is the
detection efficiency for the 1 ring events in the detector. The
efficiencies that were available to us are not the detection
efficiencies of the charged leptons but some function which we call
@xmath defined as [ 73 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

@xmath is the survival probability of a neutrino flavor @xmath after
traveling a distance @xmath given by,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

@xmath being the radius of the Earth and @xmath is the height of the
atmosphere where the neutrinos are produced. We use the atmospheric
neutrino fluxes from [ 67 ] . For the sub-GeV events the dominant
process is the charged current quasi-elastic scattering from free or
bound nucleons. We use the cross-sections given in [ 74 ] . The events
in multi-GeV range have contributions coming from quasi-elastic
scattering, single pion production and multi pion production and we have
used the cross-sections given in [ 75 ] . For the multi-GeV events we
assume that the lepton direction @xmath is the same as the incoming
neutrino direction @xmath . But actually they are slightly different. We
simulate this difference in the zenith angles by smearing the angular
distribution of the number of events with a Gaussian distribution having
a one sigma width of @xmath for @xmath type events and @xmath for the
@xmath type events [ 63 ] . For the sub-GeV events, difference in
direction between the charged lepton and the neutrinos are exactly taken
care of according to eq. ( 3.58 ) and ( 3.55 ).

In order to do a statistical analysis of the data we define a @xmath
function as [ 64 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the sum is over the sub-GeV and multi-GeV cases. The
experimentally observed rates are denoted by the superscript “exp” and
the theoretical predictions for the quantities are labeled by “th”.
@xmath is the error in @xmath obtained by combining the statistical and
systematic errors in quadrature. @xmath corresponds to the error in
@xmath . For this we take only the statistical errors since these are
much larger compared to the systematic errors. We include both the
@xmath -like and the @xmath -like up-down asymmetries in the fit so that
we have 4 degrees of freedom (6 experimental data - 2 parameters) for
the oscillation analysis in the two parameters @xmath and @xmath .

The use of these type of ratios for the @xmath analysis test has been
questioned in [ 76 ] because the error distribution of these ratios is
non-Gaussian in nature. However as it has been shown in [ 64 ] the use
of the @xmath ’s and @xmath ’s as defined above is justified within the
3 @xmath region around the best-fit point for a high statistics
experiment like SK and provides an alternative way of doing the @xmath
-analysis. A comparison of the results of [ 64 ] with those obtained in
[ 63 , 61 ] shows that the best-fit points and the allowed regions
obtained do not differ significantly in the two approaches of data
fitting. The advantage of using the ratios is that they are relatively
insensitive to the uncertainties in the neutrino fluxes and
cross-sections as the overall normalization factor gets canceled out in
the ratio. We have included the @xmath in our analysis because to
justify the @xmath oscillation scenario, it is necessary to check that
@xmath including the data on electron events gives a low value and hence
it is the standard practice to include these in the @xmath -analysis [
64 , 63 , 61 ] .

Even though the method of @xmath analysis defined above is acceptable, a
better method is to use the absolute number of e or @xmath type events
taking into account the errors and their correlations properly [ 61 , 63
] . Following this method we define our @xmath as [ 61 , 63 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.62)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the sum is over the sub-GeV and multi-GeV electron and muon bins.
The experimentally observed number of events are denoted by the
superscript “exp” and the theoretical predictions for the quantities are
labeled by “th”. The element of the error matrix @xmath is calculated as
in [ 61 ] , including the correlations between the different bins. For
two-generation analysis of the SK atmospheric neutrino data we employ
this second more widely used method of @xmath analysis and present our
results in the next section.

#### 3.2.4 Results and Discussions

Since the @xmath type events are consistent with the Monte Carlo
expectations, the only possible two-generation oscillation schemes that
one should consider to be responsible for the @xmath deficit are the
@xmath and @xmath oscillation modes ¹⁰ ¹⁰ 10 In more general four
generation schemes the @xmath can oscillate into a mixture of @xmath and
@xmath [ 62 ] . . The two cases differ from each other in the Earth
matter effects on the mass and mixing parameters for the upward
neutrinos. While for @xmath oscillations there are no effects of the
Earth matter, the @xmath has its @xmath and @xmath modulated in presence
of matter since the sterile neutrinos do not have any interaction with
the ambient matter. For the @xmath case the mass squared difference and
mixing angle in matter are given by eq. ( 2.52 ) and eq. ( 2.53 ) of
chapter 2. Since for the atmospheric neutrino anomaly the mixing angle
in vacuum is close to maximal, the effect of matter in this case is
mostly to reduce the mixing. Thus the @xmath oscillations predict a
lower suppression of the upward neutrinos than demanded by the data and
fail to reproduce the correct zenith angle distribution, the effect
being more for the higher energy neutrinos. Thus the @xmath solution
gets disfavored by the zenith angle data. In addition, since the sterile
neutrinos do not induce any neutral current event in the detector while
both the @xmath and @xmath neutrinos do, for @xmath mixing one expects a
reduction of the neutral current events while for @xmath oscillations
they remain unchanged. In their paper [ 77 ] , the SK collaboration have
shown that their neutral current sample is consistent with expectations,
there is no depletion of the events and hence transition of @xmath to
@xmath are disfavored. The SK collaboration have given 99% C.L.
exclusion plots for a combined analysis of the neutral current enriched
multi-ring events, the high energy partially contained events and the
upward-going muon data sets, in terms of @xmath oscillations. They
superimpose the 99% C.L. allowed region that they obtain from the @xmath
analysis of the FC data over these exclusion plots and show that there
is no region of overlap between the two. They thus conclude that pure
two-generation @xmath oscillations are disfavored by the data and hence
the pure @xmath mixing, which can provide excellent fit to all the
atmospheric data samples without any inconsistency is the favored
alternative [ 77 ] . The latest 1289 day data sample on the upward-going
events are consistent with @xmath appearance at the @xmath level [ 78 ]
thereby further disfavoring the sterile option. We therefore concentrate
on the @xmath oscillation scenario.

In the two-flavor @xmath picture the survival probability of an initial
@xmath of energy @xmath after traveling a distance @xmath in vacuum is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.63)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the mixing angle between the two neutrino states in
vacuum and @xmath is the oscillation wavelength defined as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath denotes the mass squared difference between the two mass
eigenstates. If we insert eq. ( 3.63 ) in eq. ( 3.58 ) and minimize the
@xmath function defined by ( 3.62 ), then for the 1144 day of SK data we
get the following best-fits and @xmath

-   @xmath , @xmath = 0.0027 eV @xmath , @xmath = 1.0

For 38 degrees of freedom ( @xmath ) this corresponds to a goodness of
fit of 55.14%. We present in fig. 3.10 the 90% and 99% C.L. allowed area
in the neutrino parameter space for two-generation @xmath oscillations.
In fig 3.9 we show with dashed lines the histograms for the best-fit
value for two-generation @xmath oscillations. Both the absolute number
of events as well as the zenith angle distributions of the SK data are
seen to be reproduced well.

### 3.3 Bounds from Accelerator and Reactor Experiments

Neutrino oscillations experiments can be broadly classified into two
types:
@xmath Disappearance experiments : In these one starts with a neutrino
beam of a definite flavor @xmath and looks for a reduction in the
original flux, after the beam has traveled a certain distance.
@xmath Appearance experiments : These experiments search for a new
flavor @xmath in the original @xmath beam, after it has been made to
travel a distance L.

Both the solar neutrino problem and the atmospheric neutrino anomaly
that we have discussed above are disappearance experiments. But both
these experiments have the intrinsic defect of large uncertainties in
model predictions of neutrino fluxes. The neutrino beams in the
laboratory experiments on the other hand have well controlled spectrum
as well as path length and hence are better suited for precise study of
neutrino mass and mixing parameters. The laboratory accelerator and
reactor experiments may operate in either the disappearance or
appearance modes. While the appearance experiments have the advantage of
being apparently easier, since one is looking for a new flavor absent in
the initial beam, the disappearance experiments have the strength to
probe the oscillations of the initial @xmath to all channels including
@xmath which can never be seen in an appearance experiments.

In two-generations the conversion probability of @xmath to another
flavor @xmath after traveling distance @xmath is given by eq. ( 2.11 )

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.65)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

@xmath being the oscillation wavelength. Sensitivity of a given
experiment can be ascertained in terms of the minimum @xmath and @xmath
that the experiment can probe. For @xmath very large @xmath , and @xmath
. For the limiting value of @xmath seen by the experiment

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

On the other hand if @xmath is such that @xmath is very small then we
can replace the sine function by its argument.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

Hence the minimum value of @xmath that the experiment can constraint
corresponds to the case where @xmath , that is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.68)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the above argument the terrestrial experiments give exclusion
plots in the @xmath – @xmath plane. All accelerator and reactor
experiment till date barring the LSND in Los Alamos have failed to
observe any positive signal of neutrino oscillations ¹¹ ¹¹ 11 The
preliminary results from the K2K experiment in Japan also gives a
positive indication of neutrino oscillations. and give exclusion plots
in the @xmath – @xmath plane. We give below a list of the most prominent
experiments and their main features.

@xmath Reactor Experiments
The neutrinos in these experiments are produced in @xmath decay of
fission products in the reactors. Thus typically one has an initial
@xmath beam with energies of the order a few MeV. Since the energies are
so small these experiments operate in the disappearance mode. These
@xmath are detected by liquid scintillation detectors through the
reaction

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.69)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since these are necessarily disappearance experiments, the incident
neutrino flux should be very accurately known to reduce the systematic
uncertainties. Due to these high systematic uncertainties the reactor
experiments fail to probe very low values of @xmath . To overcome this
problem to some extent and to reduce the uncertainties, most experiments
use two or more detectors placed at different distances and what is used
in the analysis is the ratio of the neutrino flux observed at these
different detectors. The characteristics of the most important reactor
experiments and their limits on the oscillation parameters are listed in
Table 3.6 . Among the reactor experiments the most stringent bounds in
the low @xmath range are obtained from the CHOOZ long-baseline
experiment in France [ 82 ] . This experiment has a baseline of 1 km so
that it has an average @xmath ( @xmath MeV) and hence is sensitive to
@xmath as low as @xmath eV @xmath . It observes no neutrino oscillations
in the @xmath disappearance mode and rules out @xmath for @xmath eV
@xmath [ 82 ] .

The Bugey experiment [ 81 ] also in France is most constraining in the
higher @xmath region. It rules out large parts of the LSND allowed zone
so that only @xmath eV @xmath of the allowed parameter space remains
valid.

@xmath Accelerator Experiments
The neutrino beam in these experiments consist of mainly @xmath , @xmath
, @xmath , @xmath , produced from decay of pions and kaons in
accelerators. These experiments have much higher energy neutrinos and
may operate either in the disappearance or the appearance mode,
depending on the energy of the initial neutrino beam. Table 3.6 reviews
the characteristics of the main accelerator experiments.

The L iquid S cintillator N eutrino D etector at the Los Alamos Meson
Physics Facility has claimed to have seen neutrino mass and mixing [ 89
, 90 ] . In this experiment a high energy proton beam is made to impinge
on a target thereby predominately producing @xmath . The small number of
@xmath created are absorbed so that the dominant decay chain is @xmath ,
and @xmath . Thus this beam has a paucity of @xmath and in their first
experiment, the LSND made a search for @xmath oscillations by looking
for @xmath appearance by recording the @xmath events. They reported a
detected transition probability of @xmath [ 89 ] . In this case the
@xmath and @xmath decay at rest (DAR). On the other hand if they are
made to decay in flight (DIF) (the energy for this has to be much
higher) then the @xmath do not decay much and the flux of @xmath in the
beam is small making it possible to probe the @xmath oscillation channel
as well. The LSND again claims to have seen a positive signal with a
transition probability of @xmath [ 90 ] . They have recently done a
reanalysis of their entire data sample collected between 1993-1998 for
both @xmath and @xmath oscillations with a common selection criteria and
use a novel event reconstruction [ 91 ] . The final transition
probability that they report to have observed is @xmath . The best-fit
value of the oscillation parameters @xmath and @xmath that they give are
shown in the Table 3.6 .

On the other hand KARMEN, the K arlsruhe- R utherford M edium E nergy N
eutrino experiment, at the ISIS spallation neutron facility, is an
experiment almost similar to LSND which uses @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
beam from @xmath and @xmath decays at rest and looks for @xmath and
@xmath oscillations. This experiment has been consistently inconsistent
with the positive neutrino oscillation observed at LSND [ 92 ] . It
gives an exclusion plot in the @xmath – @xmath plane which excludes the
entire LSND allowed region above @xmath eV @xmath and part of the zones
allowed for lower @xmath .

The other experiment which has reported to have seen a depletion of
expected flux due to oscillations is the still running K2K long-baseline
experiment in Japan. It sends a pure and intense @xmath beam from KEK to
SK with a baseline of 250 km [ 93 ] and is the first long-baseline
accelerator experiment. It has an average @xmath GeV which gives @xmath
and has two detectors. The near one at a distance of about 300m from the
source is a one kton water @xmath erenkov detector, similar in
technology to the SK. The far detector, 250 km away, is the SK itself.
The experiment can work both in the @xmath disappearance as well as in
the @xmath appearance modes. This experiment promises to probe the
region of the parameter space allowed by the SK atmospheric data and
thus holds the potential to pin down the exact values of the @xmath and
@xmath responsible for the atmospheric neutrino anomaly. The K2K
collaboration has already released their first results on muon events.
They detect 28 events in SK against an expectation of @xmath which is
based on the interactions of the incident beam at the near detector [ 93
] . Thus there is a suppression of the @xmath flux, though the
discrepancy is still within statistical errors. Even the neutrino energy
spectrum that they observe is as of yet very poor in statistics. Robust
results and oscillation analyses, on both the total fluxes as well as
the observed energy spectrum from this experiment is eagerly awaited.

## Chapter 4 The Energy Independent Solution to the Solar Neutrino
Problem

In the previous chapter we have seen that the suppression of the solar
neutrino flux has been confirmed now by a number of experiments [ 1 , 2
, 3 , 4 ] , covering a neutrino energy range of @xmath MeV. However
there is still considerable uncertainty regarding its energy dependence.
An energy independent suppression factor has been advocated by several
groups over the years [ 5 ] . This was shown to be disfavored however by
the combined data on the total suppression rates [ 6 ] . More recently
the weight of experimental evidence changed in favour of an energy
independent solution following the SK data on the day/night spectrum,
showing practically no energy dependence nor any perceptible day/night
effect [ 3 ] .

In this chapter we evaluate the experimental status of the energy
independent solution vis a vis the MSW solutions after the inclusion of
the SNO CC data. For the @xmath survival probability @xmath we use the
full expression given by eq. ( 3.35 ) in chapter 3, including the
coherent term containing the phase @xmath which allows us to probe down
the entire parameter space down to @xmath eV @xmath . For the
composition of the neutrino fluxes seen in various experiments and the
observed rates we refer to the Table 3.2 presented in chapter 3 where
all the survival rates are shown relative to the standard solar model
(SSM) prediction of BPB00 [ 7 ] .

The apparent energy dependence in the survival rates of Table 3.2 is
conventionally explained in terms of the vacuum oscillation (VO), small
and large angle MSW (SMA and LMA) as well as the LOW solutions [ 8 ] .
The VO and SMA solutions show strong nonmonotonic energy dependence and
SMA is essentially ruled out now with the inclusion of the SNO CC data
and the SK day/night spectrum [ 3 ] data. On the other hand the spectrum
data is compatible with the LMA and LOW solutions, which predict modest
and monotonic decrease of the survival rate with energy. We will study
the potential of an energy independent solution as a possible
explanation of the global solar neutrino data. We shall see that with
reasonable allowance for the renormalisations of the Cl rate and the
@xmath neutrino flux the data are described well by the energy
independent solution. These renormalisations shall also be seen to
improve the quality of fits with the oscillation solutions and enlarge
the region of their validity in the parameter space substantially.
Moreover we shall see that most of this enlarged region of parameter
space shows weak matter effect on @xmath , implying practically energy
independent suppression of the solar neutrino flux. Thus the energy
independent solution can be looked upon as an effective parameterization
of the oscillation solutions over this region.

We shall perform a @xmath fit of the combined data on the survival rates
of Cl, Ga, SK and SNO (CC) and the SK spectrum at day and night with the
energy independent solution as well as the four traditional solutions
mentioned above. We have discussed the @xmath function, the error matrix
and the method of analysis in chapter 3. In order to reconcile the
energy independence of the spectrum with the apparent energy dependence
in the rates of Table 3.2 , we shall consider the following variations
in the Cl rate and @xmath neutrino flux, since the Cl experiment [ 2 ]
has not been calibrated while the @xmath neutrino flux is very sensitive
to the underlying solar model.

1.  Since the Cl experiment [ 2 ] has not been calibrated, there are
    several fits in the literature disregarding this rate [ 9 , 10 , 11
    ] . We shall consider an upward renormalisations of the Cl rate by
    20% (i.e. @xmath ), which will push it marginally above the SK and
    SNO rates. This is favored not only by the energy independent
    solution but also the LMA and LOW solutions, showing monotonic
    energy dependence.

2.  The @xmath neutrino flux is very sensitive to the solar core
    temperature and hence to the underlying solar model. We shall
    consider a downward variation of the @xmath neutrino flux of BPB00 [
    7 ] ,

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (4.1)
      -- -------- -- -------

    by upto @xmath . A downward renormalisation of this flux is favored
    by the energy independent solution and to a lesser extent by LOW,
    though not by the LMA solution. It is also favored by some
    helioseismic models, e.g. the model of [ 12 ] giving @xmath . It may
    also be noted here that using 1 @xmath lower limits of the
    appropriate nuclear reaction rates Brun, Turck-Chièze and Morel [ 13
    ] have obtained a relatively low value of @xmath neutrino flux,
    @xmath .

In section 4.1 we present the results of the @xmath fit with the energy
independent solution. In section 4.2 we identify the regions of the
parameter space with @xmath energy dependence and call these the
quasi-energy independent regions. In section 4.3 we present the MSW
solutions with renormalized Cl and @xmath (the @xmath flux normalization
factor) and show the C.L. contours in the @xmath plane. Most of the
these allowed regions are seen to overlap with the quasi-energy
independent zones. We end in section 4.4 with some discussions on the
potential of future experimental measurements in distinguishing the
energy independent solution with the MSW solutions.

### 4.1 Energy Independent Solution

Table 4.1 summarizes the results of fitting the global rate + spectrum
data with an energy independent survival probability

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

We fit the data for Cl observed and Cl renormalized and for both the
cases present the results for @xmath fixed at SSM and @xmath varying
freely. It shows that even without any readjustment to the Cl rate or
the @xmath neutrino flux the energy independent solution gives an
acceptable goodness of fit (g.o.f.) of 24%. An upward renormalisation of
the Cl rate by 20% improves the g.o.f. to 42%. And varying the @xmath
neutrino flux downwards improves it further to 49%, which corresponds to
a renormalisation factor @xmath for the @xmath neutrino flux. Note
however that the g.o.f. and the best-fit value of the mixing angle for
@xmath are very close to those for @xmath . This is because the large
error in the @xmath neutrino flux of eq. ( 4.1 ) is already incorporated
into the error matrix involved in the @xmath analysis for @xmath case.

Traditionally the energy independent solution ( 4.2 ) is associated with
the averaged vacuum oscillation probability at distances much larger
than the oscillation wave-length, as originally suggested by Gribov and
Pontecorvo [ 14 ] . As we shall see below however an effectively energy
independent solution holds around the maximal mixing region over a wide
range of @xmath even after including all the matter effects in Sun and
Earth.

### 4.2 Regions of Energy Independent Solution in the @xmath Plane

The energy dependence of the survival probability arises from different
sources in different regions of the parameter space.

1.  For @xmath the Earth regeneration effect can be safely neglected.
    Then the survival probability

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (4.3)
      -- -------- -- -------

    where @xmath is the distance between the neutrino production point
    at the solar core and its detection point on Earth; and @xmath is
    the probability of the produced @xmath emerging from the Sun as the
    heavier mass eigen-state @xmath The coherent interference term,
    represented by the last term of eq. ( 4.3 ), is responsible for the
    nonmonotonic energy dependence of the VO and QVO solutions.

2.  For @xmath , the coherent term is negligible but the Earth
    regeneration contribution can be significant leading to energy
    dependence of the survival probability. Besides over a large part of
    this region, represented by the MSW triangle, the @xmath is
    adiabatically converted into @xmath in the Sun, i.e. @xmath . The
    the day/night averaged probability around these adiabatic zones is [
    10 ]

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (4.4)
      -- -------- -- -------

    where

      -- -- -- -------
               (4.5)
      -- -- -- -------

    Here @xmath is the matter density in the Earth ¹ ¹ 1 Though in eqs.
    ( 4.4 ) and ( 4.5 ) we have shown the regeneration for a constant
    density Earth, we have used the two slab model for actual
    calculations. and @xmath the average number of electrons per
    nucleon. The regeneration contribution is always positive and peaks
    around @xmath , i.e. @xmath (cf. fig. 3.4 ). Regions of the
    parameter space which give non-adiabatic neutrino propagation in the
    Sun pick up a strong energy dependence.

3.  Finally for @xmath the survival probability can be approximated by
    the average vacuum oscillation probability of eq. ( 4.2 ). The MSW
    solutions (LMA and SMA) lie on the boundary of the regions ii) and
    iii), i.e. @xmath for @xmath MeV. The survival probability @xmath
    goes down from @xmath to @xmath in going up from Ga to SK (SNO)
    energy.

All the solar neutrino rates except that of SK have @xmath error, which
is also true for the SK energy spectrum. The SK normalization has at
least similar uncertainty from the @xmath neutrino flux. Therefore we
shall treat solutions, which predict survival probability @xmath within
10% of eq. ( 4.2 ) over the Ga to SK energy range, as effectively energy
independent solutions. Moreover the predicted Ga, Cl and SNO rates will
be averaged over the respective energy spectra, while the predicted SK
rates will be averaged over 0.5 MeV bins, corresponding to the SK
spectral data, since experimental information is available for these
averaged quantities only.

The shaded parts of fig. 4.1 shows the regions of effective energy
independent solution as per the above definition. The parameter space
has been restricted to @xmath in view of the constraint from the CHOOZ
experiment [ 15 ] . One sees that the energy independent solution ( 4.2
) is effectively valid over the two quasi-vacuum oscillation regions
lying above and below the MSW range. Moreover it is valid over a much
larger range of @xmath around the maximal mixing region, since the solar
matter effect does not affect @xmath at @xmath . It is this near-maximal
mixing strip that is relevant for the observed survival probability,
@xmath . The upper strip @xmath spans the regions iii) and part of ii)
till it is cut off by the Earth regeneration effect. The lower strip
@xmath spans parts of region ii) and i) till it is cut off by the
coherent term contribution. Note that this near-maximal mixing strip
represents a very important region of the parameter space, which is
favored by the socalled bimaximal mixing models of solar and atmospheric
neutrino oscillations [ 16 , 17 ] .

One can easily check that averaging over the SK energy bins of 0.5 MeV
has the effect of washing out the coherent term contribution for @xmath
. But including this term enables us to trace the contour down to its
lower limit. It was claimed in ref. [ 18 ] that the lower strip
disappears when one includes the coherent term contribution. This may be
due to the fact that their predicted rate in the SK energy range was not
integrated over the corresponding bin widths of 0.5 MeV.

To get further insight into the oscillation phenomenon in the maximal
mixing region we have plotted in fig. 4.2 the predicted survival rates
at maximal mixing against @xmath for the Ga, Cl, SK and SNO experiments.
In each case the rate has been averaged over the corresponding energy
spectrum. This is similar to the fig. 7 of Gonzalez-Garcia, Pena-Garay,
Nir and Smirnov [ 10 ] . As in [ 10 ] the predictions have been shown
relative to the central value of the various neutrino fluxes of BPB00
along with those differing by @xmath from the central value, e.g. for
the @xmath flux @xmath . We have found that these curves are in good
agreement with the corresponding ones of [ 10 ] . The two regions of
@xmath energy dependence for maximal mixing are indicated by vertical
lines. One can easily check that in these regions the central curves lie
within 10% of the energy independent prediction @xmath (note that the SK
rate apparently looks higher due to the neutral current contribution).
One can clearly see the energy dependence due to the violent
oscillations in the VO region (on the left) and the Earth regeneration
peak in the LOW region (in the middle), particularly for the Ga
experiment. It should be noted that the gap between the two energy
independent regions due to the Earth regeneration effect in fig. 4.1 is
a little narrower than here. This is due to a cancellation between the
positive contribution from the Earth regeneration effect and the
negative contribution from the solar matter effect at @xmath . It
ensures that the resulting survival rate agrees with the energy
independent solution ( 4.2 ) over a somewhat larger range of @xmath
slightly below the maximal mixing angle.

The observed rates from the Ga, Cl, SK and SNO experiments are shown in
fig. 4.2 as horizontal lines along with their @xmath errors. With 20%
downward renormalisation of the @xmath neutrino flux @xmath the energy
independent prediction is seen to agree with the SK rate and also
approximately with SNO. It is higher than the Cl rate by about @xmath .
The agreement with the Ga rate can be improved by going to a little
smaller @xmath and compensating the resulting deviation from the other
rates by a somewhat smaller @xmath as in Table 4.1 . Nonetheless the
maximal mixing solution for @xmath , shown here, is in reasonable
agreement with the observed rates over the energy independent regions.
The Earth regeneration effect can be seen to improve the agreement with
the Ga experiment for the LOW solution.

### 4.3 The SMA, LMA, LOW and VO Solutions

Tables 4.2 and 4.3 summarise the results of fits to the global rates +
spectrum data in terms of the conventional oscillation solutions. Table
4.2 shows solutions to the data with observed and renormalized Cl rate
with the neutrino flux of BPB00 @xmath , while Table 4.3 shows the
effects of renormalizing this @xmath neutrino flux downwards by 25%
@xmath . The corresponding 90%, 95%, 99% and 99.73% @xmath contours are
shown in fig. 4.3 .

As we see from these tables and fig. 4.3 the SMA solution gives rather
poor fit in each case, with no allowed contour at @xmath level. This
result agrees with the recent fits of [ 19 ] to the global data
including SNO. The fit of [ 20 ] to these data shows a small allowed
region for SMA solution at @xmath level due to a slightly different
method of treating the normalization in the SK spectrum data, as
explained there.

The LMA and LOW solutions give good fits to the original data set, which
improve further with the upward renormalisation of the Cl rate by @xmath
. This is because the monotonic decrease of rate with energy, implied by
these solutions, favors the Cl rate to be marginally higher than the SNO
and SK rates as mentioned earlier. For the renormalized Cl case,
downward renormalisation of the @xmath neutrino flux by 25% is seen to
give a modest increase (decrease) of g.o.f. for the best LOW (LMA)
solution. On the other hand the allowed ranges increase in both cases as
we see from fig. 4.3 b and c. Combined together they imply that the
downward renormalisation of the @xmath neutrino flux modestly favors the
LOW solution but makes little difference to the LMA. Its main effect on
these two solutions is increasing their allowed ranges in the parameter
space. Comparing fig. 4.3 c with fig. 4.1 shows that much of these
enlarged ranges of validity correspond to effectively energy independent
solution. It is interesting to note that the best-fit values of
parameters in the LMA region are same for Cl observed and Cl
renormalized cases while the @xmath improves for the latter. This shows
that the best-fit already chose a probability at Cl energy, which is a
little higher than that at SK/SNO energy. Renormalizing the Cl rate
brought that point up to the fitted curve without changing the best-fit
parameters.

While the best vacuum solution seems to show remarkably high g.o.f.
particularly for renormalized Cl rate and @xmath neutrino flux, its
regions of validity are two miniscule islands just below the lower
energy independent strip of fig. 4.3 b,c. This solution has also been
obtained in the global fits of ref. [ 19 , 20 ] as well as the SK fit to
their rate and spectrum data [ 22 ] . The position and size of its range
of validity suggest this to be a downward fluctuation of the effectively
energy independent quasi vacuum oscillation rather than a genuine VO
solution of Just-So type. To get further insight into this solution we
have analysed the resulting energy dependence. It shows practically no
energy dependence below 5 MeV, but a 15% fall over the @xmath MeV range.
The latter seems to follow the SK spectral points rather closely amidst
large fluctuation. To check the stability of this trend we have repeated
the fit to the SK spectral data points, plotted over 8 broad energy bins
shown in [ 22 ] , which show much less fluctuation than the @xmath
points sample. The solution completely disappears from this fit. This
confirms that the above VO solution is simply an artifact of the
sampling of the SK spectral data.

For completeness we summarise in Table 4.4 the best fits of the above
solutions with free @xmath neutrino flux normalization. The SMA solution
favors a very low @xmath neutrino flux @xmath , which raises the SK and
SNO rates more than the Cl, thus accentuating the nonmonotonic energy
dependence of Table 3.2 . Still the g.o.f. of the SMA solution is rather
marginal. On the other hand the LMA solution favors @xmath , which
suppresses the SK and SNO rates more than the Cl, resulting in a
monotonic decrease of rate with energy. But the corresponding g.o.f. are
no better than those of Table 4.2 . The results of the LOW and VO fits
are similar to those of Table 4.3 .

### 4.4 Comparisons and Discussions

Let us conclude by briefly discussing whether some of the forthcoming
neutrino experiments will be able to discriminate between the energy
independent and the MSW solutions. In particular the SNO experiment [ 23
] is expected to provide both the charged current and neutral current
scattering rates over roughly the same energy range as SK. Thus the
@xmath neutrino flux can be factored out from their ratio, CC/NC. For
oscillations into active neutrino the corresponding double ratio @xmath
is predicted to be larger than 0.5 for the energy independent solution
and smaller than 0.5 for the LMA and LOW solutions. In the absence of
the neutral current data from SNO one can try to make a similar
comparison with the ratio of SK elastic and SNO charged current
scattering rates,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we have assumed a common survival rate neglecting the small
difference between the SK and SNO energy spectra [ 23 ] . One can
eliminate @xmath from the two rates; and the resulting @xmath neutrino
flux can be seen to be in good agreement with the BPB00 estimate [ 4 ] .
Alternatively one can factor out the flux from the ratio

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

Table 4.5 shows the best fit values of the above ratio for the LMA, LOW
and the energy independent solutions along with the corresponding
predictions for @xmath . The predictions of the maximal mixing solution
is also shown for comparison. While the LMA and LOW predictions for the
@xmath ratio differ by @xmath they differ by only about @xmath in the
case of the @xmath ratio. The observed ratio @xmath is seen to favour
the LMA over the LOW and energy independent solutions; but even the
largest discrepancy is only @xmath . With the expected sample of several
thousand @xmath and @xmath events from SNO one expects to reduce the
@xmath error for each of these ratios to about 5%. Then one will be able
to discriminate between the three solutions meaningfully, particularly
with the help of the @xmath ratio from SNO. On the other hand the LOW
solution predicts a large Day-Night asymmetry of @xmath 10% for the
@xmath neutrino [ 10 , 11 ] at the Borexino [ 24 ] and the KamLAND [ 25
] experiments. This will be able to distinguish the LOW from the LMA and
the energy independent solutions. Lastly it should be noted that the
reactor neutrino data at KamLAND is expected to show oscillatory
behavior for the LMA solution [ 26 ] , which will help to distinguish it
from the LOW or a generic energy independent solution.

In summary the recent SK data on day/night spectrum is in potential
conflict with the apparent energy dependence in the suppression rates
observed in Ga, Cl, SK and SNO experiments. Including matter effects one
can get acceptable oscillation solutions to both rates and spectrum data
only over limited regions of mass and mixing parameters. However an
upward renormalisation of the Cl rate by 20% @xmath results in
substantial improvement of the quality of fit. Moreover a downward
renormalisation of the @xmath neutrino flux by 25% @xmath as suggested
by the helioseismic model enlarges the allowed region of the parameter
space substantially. Over most of this enlarged region the energy
dependence resulting from the matter effects is too weak to be
discernible at the present level of experimental accuracy. Hence with
these renormalisations of the Cl rate and the @xmath neutrino flux the
data can be described very well by an energy independent solution.

## Chapter 5 A Three Generation Oscillation Analysis of the
Super-Kamiokande Atmospheric Neutrino Data Beyond One Mass Scale
Dominance Approximation

In chapter 3 we have made detailed analysis of the solar and atmospheric
neutrino data and presented our results in the two generation framework.
In real world there are three active flavors of neutrinos [ 1 ] . If one
wants to do an analysis of the SK atmospheric neutrino data [ 2 ] in a
three-generation framework, then there are two possibilities. The most
popular three-generation picture in the context of the SK data is the
one where one of the mass squared differences is in the solar neutrino
range and the other is suitable for atmospheric neutrino oscillations [
3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] . In such a scheme one mass scale dominance
(OMSD) applies for atmospheric neutrinos and the relevant probabilities
are functions of two of the mixing angles and one mass squared
difference. This picture however cannot explain the LSND results [ 9 ] .
In this chapter we perform a three flavor @xmath -analysis of the SK
atmospheric neutrino data assuming a mass pattern with @xmath fixed in
the eV @xmath range (henceforth @xmath ) and allowing the other mass
scale to vary arbitrarily. We also incorporate the CHOOZ reactor results
[ 10 ] into the analysis. Apart from being suitable to explain the SK
atmospheric neutrino data this spectrum is also interesting for the
laboratory based neutrino oscillation experiments as the higher mass
scale is explorable in the short base line experiments, whereas the
lower mass scale can be probed in the long base line experiments. In
this scheme to a good approximation, neutrino oscillation in the
short-base line accelerators and reactors will be governed by one (the
higher) mass scale [ 11 , 12 ] – and only two of the mixing angles
appear in the expressions for the oscillation probabilities. For the
atmospheric and the long baseline experiments the characteristic energy
and length scales are such that in general both mass differences are of
relevance and the probabilities involve all the three mixing angles.
However the higher mass scale gives rise to @xmath independent average
oscillations and it does not enter the @xmath fit directly. We determine
the best-fit values of @xmath and the three mixing angles by performing
a @xmath analysis of the

-   SK atmospheric neutrino data

-   SK atmospheric and CHOOZ data

We do a bin by bin analysis of the data taking into account the errors
and their correlations and use the @xmath function described in eq. (
3.62 ) of chapter 3. Finally we compare the allowed values of the mixing
angles as obtained from the above analysis with those allowed by the
other accelerator and reactor neutrino oscillation data including LSND
and KARMEN2.

The mass scheme of this paper was first considered in [ 13 , 14 ] after
the declaration of the LSND result. These papers performed a combined
three generation analysis of accelerator and reactor results as well as
the Kamiokande atmospheric neutrino data. Three-generation picture with
the higher mass difference in the eV @xmath range and the lower mass
difference in the atmospheric range has also been considered in [ 15 ,
16 ] (pre-SK) and [ 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 ] (post-SK). These papers
attempted to explain both solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies
mainly by maximal @xmath oscillations driven by @xmath eV @xmath .
Although it was claimed in [ 17 , 18 ] that this scenario can provide a
good fit to all the available data on neutrino oscillations, it was
shown in [ 19 ] and also later in [ 20 ] that this scenario cannot
reproduce the zenith angle dependence of the SK atmospheric neutrino
data.

In this chapter our aim is to determine the allowed oscillation
parameter ranges consistent with SK atmospheric, CHOOZ, LSND and other
accelerator and reactor experiments. The solar neutrino problem can be
explained by invoking a sterile neutrino. We discuss in the conclusions
how the solar neutrino flux suppression can be explained in our
scenario.

The plan of the chapter is as follows. In section 5.1.1 we present the
formalism for three-generation oscillation analysis in vacuum. We
calculate the required probabilities including the earth matter effects
in section 5.1.2. We use this expression of the probability for the
actual calculation of the number of events. In section 5.2 we present
the three-generation @xmath analysis of only SK atmospheric neutrino
data using the computer code described in detail in chapter 3. In
section 5.3 we present the combined @xmath analysis of SK and CHOOZ
data. In section 5.4 we compare the allowed values of mixing angles from
the above analyses with those allowed by the other accelerator and
reactor data including the latest results from LSND and KARMEN2. In
section 5.5 we discuss the implications of our results for the future
long baseline experiments and end in section 5.6 with some discussions
and conclusions.

### 5.1 Three-Flavor Analysis

#### 5.1.1 The Vacuum Oscillation Probabilities

The general expression for the probability that an initial @xmath of
energy @xmath gets converted to a @xmath after traveling a distance
@xmath in vacuum is given by eq. ( 2.6 ) in chapter 2. The actual forms
of the various survival and transition probabilities depend on the
neutrino mass spectrum assumed and the choice of the mixing matrix
@xmath relating the flavor eigenstates to the mass eigenstates. We
choose the flavor states @xmath 1,2, and 3 to correspond to e, @xmath
and @xmath respectively. The most suitable parameterization of @xmath
for the mass spectrum chosen by us is @xmath where @xmath denotes the
rotation matrix in the @xmath -plane. This yields:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath here and everywhere else in this chapter. We
have assumed CP-invariance so that @xmath is real. The above choice of
@xmath has the advantage that @xmath does not appear in the expressions
for the probabilities for the laboratory experiments [ 14 ] .

The probabilities relevant for atmospheric neutrinos are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.2)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.3)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , where @xmath is given by eq. ( 2.7 ). Apart from the most
general three generation regime, the following limits are of interest,
as we will see later in the context of the SK data:

1.   The two-generation limits
    Because of the presence of more parameters as compared to the one
    mass scale dominance picture there are twelve possible
    two-generation limits [ 21 ] with the oscillations driven by either
    @xmath or @xmath . Below we list these limits specifying the mass
    scales that drive the oscillations:

    -   @xmath ), @xmath )
        @xmath ), @xmath )

    -   @xmath ), @xmath )
        @xmath ), @xmath )

    -   @xmath ), @xmath )
        @xmath ), @xmath )

2.   @xmath = 0.0
    In this limit the relevant probabilities become

      -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.5)
      -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

      -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.6)
      -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

      -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.7)
      -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

    Thus @xmath is the same as the two generation limit, @xmath is
    governed by two of the mixing angles and one mass scale and @xmath
    is governed by two mixing angles and both mass scales.

3.   @xmath = 0.0
    For this case the probabilities take the form

      -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.8)
      -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

      -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.9)
      -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

      -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.10)
      -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

    In this case the probabilities are governed by two mass scales and
    two mixing angles.

We note that for cases (2) and (3) the probabilities are symmetric under
the transformation @xmath . The probabilities for these cases are
functions of at most two mixing angles as in the OMSD case [ 3 ] but
they are governed by both mass scales making these limits different from
the OMSD limit.

#### 5.1.2 Earth Matter Effects

Since on their way to the detector the upward going neutrinos pass
through the earth, it is important in general to include the matter
effect in the atmospheric neutrino analysis. The matter contribution to
the effective squared mass of the electron neutrinos:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the neutrino energy and @xmath is the ambient electron
density. Assuming a typical density of 5 gm/cc and @xmath = 10 GeV, the
matter potential @xmath eV @xmath and since this is of the same order as
@xmath in our case, matter effects should be studied carefully.

The mass matrix in the flavor basis in presence of matter is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the mass matrix in the mass eigenbasis, @xmath is the
mixing matrix and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath , one can solve the eigenvalue problem using the degenerate
perturbation theory, where the @xmath and @xmath terms are treated as a
perturbation to the dominant @xmath and @xmath dependent terms. The
mixing angle in matter is then given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

while the mass squared difference in matter turns out to be

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

The mixing angles @xmath and @xmath as well as the larger mass squared
difference @xmath remain unaltered in matter. From eq. ( 5.14 ) and (
5.15 ) we note the following

-   In the limit of both @xmath and @xmath @xmath , the matter effect
    vanishes and we recover the two-generation @xmath limit.

-   The resonance condition now becomes @xmath . So that for @xmath ,
    one can have resonance for both neutrinos – if @xmath – as well as
    for antineutrinos – if @xmath . This is different from the OMSD
    picture where for @xmath only neutrinos can resonate.

-   In the limit of @xmath

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (5.16)
      -- -------- -- --------

    Here one gets resonance for neutrinos only (if @xmath ).

-   In the limit @xmath

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (5.17)
      -- -------- -- --------

    For this case for @xmath , there is no resonance for neutrinos but
    antineutrinos can resonate.

-   In the limit where @xmath

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (5.18)
      -- -------- -- --------

    Thus even for small values of @xmath the mass squared difference in
    matter is @xmath and one may still hope to see oscillations for the
    upward neutrinos due to matter effects. The other point to note is
    that the mixing angle in matter @xmath depends only on @xmath and
    @xmath and is independent of the vacuum mixing angle @xmath and
    @xmath . Contrast this with the OMSD and the two-generation @xmath
    oscillations. For both the two-generation @xmath as well as the
    three-generation OMSD case, for @xmath , the mixing angle in matter
    @xmath , but for the mass spectrum considered in this paper the
    @xmath maybe large depending on the values of and . Hence we see
    that the demixing effect which gives the lower bound on allowed
    values of @xmath in the two generation @xmath or the
    three-generation OMSD case, does not arise here and we hope to get
    allowed regions even for very low values of @xmath . On the other
    hand even small values of @xmath in vacuum can get enhanced in
    matter. This special case where @xmath was considered in an earlier
    paper [ 22 ] .

-   In the limit of @xmath

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (5.19)
      -- -------- -- --------

-   While for @xmath

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (5.20)
      -- -------- -- --------

    For the last two cases, corresponding to @xmath , again the mixing
    angle @xmath in matter is independent of its corresponding value in
    vacuum and hence for appropriate choices of the other three
    parameters, @xmath , and , one can get large values for @xmath even
    though the vacuum mixing angle is zero.

The amplitude that an initial @xmath of energy @xmath is detected as
@xmath after traveling through the earth is

  -- -------- -- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath      @xmath            (5.21)
                          @xmath   
  -- -------- -- -------- -------- --------

where we have considered the earth to be made of two slabs, a mantle and
a core with constant densities of 4.5 gm/cc and 11.5 gm/cc respectively
and include the non-adiabatic effects at the boundaries. The mixing
matrix in the mantle and the core are given by @xmath and @xmath
respectively. @xmath , @xmath = core(mantle) and @xmath is the mass of
the @xmath neutrino state in the core(mantle). The neutrino is produced
at time @xmath , hits the earth mantle at @xmath , hits the core at
@xmath , leaves the core at @xmath and finally hits the detector at time
@xmath . The Greek indices ( @xmath ) denote the flavor eigenstates
while the Latin indices ( @xmath ) give the mass eigenstates. The
corresponding expression for the probability is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

For our calculations of the number of events we have used the full
expression given by eq.( 5.21 ) and ( 5.22 ).

### 5.2 @xmath-analysis of the SK Data

We do a bin by bin @xmath analysis of the 1144 days SK atmospheric
neutrino data [ 23 ] following the procedure of statistical analysis
given in [ 3 , 24 ] . We minimize the @xmath function defined in chapter
3, eq. ( 3.62 ). For contained events there are forty experimental data
points. The probabilities for the atmospheric neutrinos are explicit
functions of one mass-squared difference and three mixing angles making
the number of degrees of freedom (d.o.f) 36. The other mass squared
difference gives rise to @xmath independent average oscillations and
hence does not enter the fit as an independent parameter.

For the three-generation scheme considered here the @xmath and the
best-fit values of parameters that we get are

-   @xmath , @xmath eV @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath

This solution is allowed at 53.28% probability.

The solid(dashed) lines in fig. 5.1 present the variation of the @xmath
for the SK data, with respect to one of the parameters keeping the other
three unconstrained, when we include(exclude) the matter effect. In fig.
5.1 (a) as we go towards smaller values of @xmath around @xmath eV
@xmath the effect of matter starts becoming important as the matter term
is now comparable to the mass term. If matter effects are not there then
for values of @xmath @xmath eV @xmath the @xmath term in eq. ( 5.4 ) is
very small and there is no up-down asymmetry resulting in very high
values of @xmath as is evident from the dashed curve. If the matter
effects are included, then in the limit of very low @xmath the matter
term dominates and @xmath is given by eq.( 5.18 ). Since this term
@xmath eV @xmath there can be depletion of the neutrinos passing through
the earth causing an updown asymmetry. For @xmath around @xmath eV
@xmath , there is cancellation between the two comparable terms in the
numerator of eq. ( 5.14 ) and the mixing angle becomes very small and
hence the @xmath around these values of @xmath comes out to be very
high.

Fig 5.1 (b) illustrates the corresponding variation of @xmath with while
the other three parameters are allowed to vary arbitrarily. For small
and large values of @xmath the inclusion of matter effect makes a
difference. For @xmath either very small or large ( @xmath ) the overall
suppression of the @xmath flux is less than that required by the data if
vacuum oscillation is operative and so it is ruled out. If we include
matter effects then in the limit of @xmath and @xmath the matter mixing
angle is given by eqs. ( 5.19 ) and ( 5.20 ), which can be large for
suitable values of and and hence one gets lower @xmath even for these
values of @xmath .

In figs 5.1 (c) and 5.1 (d) we show the effect of and respectively on
@xmath . From the solid and the dashed lines it is clear that matter
effects do not vary much the allowed ranges of and .

The dashed-dotted line in the figure shows the 99% C.L. (= 13.28 for 4
parameters) limit. In Table 5.1 we give the allowed ranges of the mixing
parameters, inferred from fig. 5.1 at 99% C.L. for the 1144 day SK
atmospheric data, with and without matter effects.

#### 5.2.1 Zenith-Angle Distribution

Since the probabilities in our case are in general governed by two mass
scales and all three mixing angles it is difficult to understand the
allowed regions. To facilitate the qualitative understanding we present
in figs. 5.2 and 5.3 the histograms which describe the zenith angle
distribution. The event distributions in these histograms are
approximately given by,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the quantities with suffix 0 indicates the no-oscillation values.
For the sub-GeV data @xmath to a good approximation however for the
multi-GeV data this varies in the range 2 (for @xmath =0) to 3 (for
@xmath 1) [ 3 ] .

In fig. 5.2 (a) we study the effect of varying @xmath and @xmath for
fixed values of @xmath = 0.002 eV @xmath and @xmath = 0.5. From eq. (
5.14 ), ( 5.15 ) and from fig. 5.1 we see that for the values of the
@xmath and @xmath considered in this figure the matter effects are small
and we can understand the histograms from the vacuum oscillation
probabilities. The thick solid line shows the event distribution for
@xmath and @xmath . As @xmath increases from 0, keeping @xmath as 0,
from eqs. ( 5.5 ) and ( 5.6 ) @xmath decreases from 1 and @xmath
increases from zero resulting in a net electron depletion according to
eq. ( 5.24 ). The long dashed line corresponds to @xmath = 0.3 for which
the electron depletion is too high as compared to data. The muon events
are also affected as @xmath increases with increasing @xmath even though
@xmath is independent of @xmath . On the other hand for @xmath = 0.0,
the effect of increasing @xmath is to increase the number of electron
events and decrease the number of muon events according to eqs. ( 5.8 ),
( 5.9 ), ( 5.10 ), ( 5.24 ) and ( 5.23 ). This is shown by the
short-dashed and dotted lines in fig. 5.2 (a). For @xmath = 0.2 the
electron excess and muon depletion both becomes too high as compared to
the data. For the case when both @xmath and @xmath are 0.1 the electron
depletion caused by increasing @xmath and the excess caused by
increasing @xmath gets balanced and the event distributions are
reproduced quite well, shown by the dashed-dotted line.

In fig. 5.2 (b) we study the effect of varying @xmath and @xmath in the
limit of @xmath with @xmath fixed at 0.1. Although we use the full
probabilities including the matter effect, for 0.004 eV @xmath this is
not so important and one can understand the histograms from the vacuum
oscillation probabilities. For fixed @xmath as @xmath increases, @xmath
decreases, making the muon depletion higher. This is shown in the figure
for two representative values of @xmath . The electron events are not
affected much by change of . The slight increase with is due to increase
of both @xmath and @xmath . To understand the dependence on @xmath we
note that for @xmath , if one looks at the vacuum oscillation
probabilities, @xmath . For 0.004 eV @xmath the contribution of @xmath
is more resulting in a lower number of muon events. For the electron
events however the behavior with @xmath is opposite, with @xmath . Thus
with increasing @xmath the number of electron events increase. Also note
that since the contribution of @xmath comes with opposite sign the
zenith-angle distribution for a fixed @xmath is opposite for the muon
and the electron events.

In fig. 5.3 (c) we show the histograms in the limit of @xmath = 0.0,
keeping @xmath as 0.1 and varying @xmath and @xmath . As @xmath
increases all the relevant probabilities decrease and therefore both
@xmath and @xmath decrease giving less number of events for both. For
this case the @xmath term comes with the same sign (negative) in both
@xmath and @xmath . Therefore the depletion is more for higher @xmath
for both muon and electron events.

Finally, the long dashed line in fig. 5.3 (d) represent the histograms
for the best-fit value for two-generation @xmath oscillations, for which
@xmath . The short dashed line gives the histograms for the
three-generation best-fit values. Both give comparable explanation for
the zenith angle distribution of the data. The dotted line gives the
event distribution for @xmath eV @xmath . As discussed earlier even for
such low value of @xmath , we find that due to the unique feature of the
beyond OMSD neutrino mass spectrum, earth matter effects ensure that
both the sub-GeV as well as the multi-GeV upward muon events are very
well reproduced, as are the electron events. But since is high, the
downward @xmath are depleted more than the data requires.

#### 5.2.2 Allowed Parameter Region

In fig. 5.4 the solid lines give the 99% C.L. allowed area from SK data
in the @xmath - @xmath plane keeping the values of @xmath and @xmath
fixed in the allowed range from fig. 5.1 and Table 5.1 . The first panel
represents the two-generation @xmath oscillation limit modulo the
difference in the definition of the C.L. limit as the number of
parameters are different. We have seen from the histograms in fig. 5.2
(a) that raising results in electron excess and muon depletion. On the
other hand increase in causes electron depletion. The above features are
reflected in the shrinking and disappearance of the allowed regions in
the first row and column. In the panels where both and are nonzero one
may get allowed regions only when the electron depletion due to
increasing is replenished by the increase in .

In fig. 5.5 we present the 99% C.L. allowed areas in the bilogarithmic
@xmath plane for various fixed values of the parameters @xmath and
@xmath . We use the @xmath representation which enlarges the allowed
regions at the corners and the clarity is enhanced. The four corners in
this plot refer to the two-generation limits discussed before. The
extreme left corner ( @xmath ) correspond to the two generation @xmath
oscillation limit. As we move up increasing @xmath , one has @xmath and
@xmath mixing in addition and for @xmath one goes to the two generation
@xmath oscillation region. For the best-fit values of @xmath and if we
take and to be 0 and @xmath respectively, then the @xmath is 66.92 which
is therefore ruled out. Both the right hand corners in all the panels
refer to pure @xmath oscillations and therefore there are no allowed
regions in these zones. For the panels in the first row, @xmath eV
@xmath and the 2-generation @xmath oscillation limit is just disallowed.
The small area allowed for the middle panel of first row (between the
solid lines) is due to the fact that for non-zero and the electron
events are better reproduced, while @xmath takes care of the muon
events. Hence for this case slight mixture of @xmath and @xmath
oscillations is favoured. This feature was also reflected in the fact
that in the fig. 5.4 , the panel for @xmath and @xmath has more allowed
range for @xmath than the panel for the 2-generation @xmath limit. For
the panels with @xmath eV @xmath , both the pure @xmath limit as well as
full three-generation oscillations, give good fit. For the last two rows
with @xmath eV @xmath and @xmath eV @xmath the matter effects are
important in controlling the shape of the allowed regions. Infact the
allowed region that one gets for @xmath eV @xmath and @xmath = 0.5 is
the hallmark of the matter effect in this particular three-generation
scheme. As can be seen from fig. 5.1 (a) and Table 5.1 , if one does not
include the matter effect, then there are no allowed regions below
@xmath = 0.0005 eV @xmath for any arbitrary combination of the other
three parameters. Even for the first and the last panels with @xmath eV
@xmath , one gets allowed areas solely due to matter effects.

In fig. 5.6 the solid lines show the 99% C.L. allowed regions from SK
data in the @xmath plane for fixed values of @xmath and @xmath . In
contrast to the previous figure, here (and in the next figure) we use
the @xmath representation because the allowed regions are around @xmath
and this region gets compressed in the @xmath representation. For
explaining the various allowed regions we separate the figures in two
sets

@xmath For @xmath = 0.0, the four corners of the panels represent the
no-oscillation limits inconsistent with the data. Also as discussed in
the earlier sections for @xmath = 0.0 or 1.0 one goes to the limit of
pure @xmath conversions driven by @xmath , which is not consistent with
data. One obtains allowed regions only when @xmath is close to 0.5 with
@xmath small, so that @xmath conversions are dominant. The allowed range
of is controlled mainly by the electron excess as has been discussed
before while the allowed range of is determined mostly by the muon
depletion.

@xmath For @xmath , the four corners represent the two-generation @xmath
oscillation limit and hence these corners are not allowed. For @xmath or
1.0 and @xmath 0 or 1 one has @xmath driven @xmath and @xmath conversion
and @xmath driven @xmath conversions. This scenario is not allowed as it
gives excess of electron events and also fails to reproduce the correct
zenith angle dependence. For a fixed @xmath as @xmath increases the
electron depletion increases which can be balanced by increasing @xmath
which increases the number of electron events. Hence for a fixed @xmath
the allowed regions shift towards higher @xmath values.

As in fig. 5.5 the allowed area in the middle panel of the last row is
due to the inclusion of the matter effect.

In fig. 5.7 the solid contours refer to the 99% C.L. allowed areas from
SK atmospheric neutrino data in the @xmath plane for various values of
@xmath and @xmath .

@xmath For @xmath = 0.0 the corners represent no oscillation limits. In
the limit @xmath or 1, one gets @xmath oscillation driven by @xmath
which is also not allowed. For @xmath = 0.0 and @xmath one has maximal
two-flavour @xmath oscillation limit which is therefore allowed (not
allowed for @xmath eV @xmath as discussed before). As @xmath increases
the electron depletion becomes higher and that restricts higher @xmath
values.

@xmath For @xmath , the four corners represent two-generation limits
driven by @xmath . This is the regime of average oscillations and cannot
explain the zenith angle dependence of the data. For a fixed @xmath the
allowed region first expands and then shrinks in size and also shifts
towards higher @xmath values as @xmath increases just as in fig. 5.6 .

Matter effect is important for the last two rows and the increase in the
allowed areas for the last two panels of @xmath eV @xmath are typical
signatures of matter effect.

In fig. 5.8 we present the allowed range in the @xmath plane with @xmath
in the @xmath eV @xmath range and , fixed at 0.185 and 0.372
respectively. We get allowed regions in this range of small @xmath and
small mixing due to matter effects – a feature unique to the mass
spectrum considered in this chapter.

### 5.3 @xmath analysis of the SK + CHOOZ Data

The CHOOZ experiment can probe upto @xmath eV @xmath and hence it can be
important to cross-check the atmospheric neutrino results. In particular
a two-generation analysis shows that CHOOZ data disfavours the @xmath
solution to the atmospheric neutrino problem. The general expression for
the survival probability of the electron neutrino in presence of three
flavours is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is the most general expression without the one mass scale dominance
approximation. We now minimize the @xmath defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is calculated as before using eq. ( 3.62 ) and we define
@xmath as [ 25 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are the experimental values, @xmath are the corresponding
theoretical predictions and the sum is over 15 energy bins of data of
the CHOOZ experiment [ 10 ] . For the CHOOZ experiment the @xmath term
does not always average out to 0.5 (for SK this term always averages to
0.5) and one has to do the energy integration properly. For our analysis
we keep the @xmath fixed at 0.5 eV @xmath and do a four parameter fit as
in SK. The @xmath and the best-fit values of parameters that we get are

-   @xmath , @xmath = 0.0023 eV @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath .

Thus the best-fit values shift towards the two-generation limit when we
include the CHOOZ result. This provides a very good fit to the data
being allowed at 80.45% probability.

The dotted lines in fig. 5.1 give the combined SK+CHOOZ @xmath given by
eq. ( 5.26 ), as a function of one of the parameters, keeping the other
three unconstrained. We find that the CHOOZ data severely restricts the
allowed ranges for the parameters and to values @xmath , while @xmath
and are left almost unaffected. Since CHOOZ is consistent with no
oscillation one requires @xmath close to 1. So the second and the third
terms in eq. ( 5.25 ) should separately be very small. The second term
implies @xmath to be close to either 0 or 1. @xmath close to zero
implies either or close to 1 which is not consistent with SK. Therefore
@xmath is close to 1. Then from unitarity both @xmath and @xmath are
close to 0 and so the third term goes to zero irrespective of the value
of @xmath and . Hence contrary to expectations, CHOOZ puts almost no
restriction on the allowed values of and @xmath , although @xmath eV
@xmath – in the regime in which CHOOZ is sensitive. On the other hand it
puts severe constraints on the allowed values of and in order to
suppress the average oscillations driven by @xmath . Because of such low
values of and the matter effects for the atmospheric neutrinos are not
important and the additional allowed area with low @xmath and high
obtained in the SK analysis due to matter effects are no longer allowed.
The 99% C.L. regions allowed by a combined analysis of SK and CHOOZ data
is shown by the dotted lines in figs. 5.4 - 5.7 . It is seen that most
of the regions allowed by the three-flavour analysis of the SK data is
ruled out when we include the CHOOZ result. None of the allowed regions
shown in fig. 5.4 are allowed excepting the two-generation @xmath
oscillation limit because CHOOZ does not allow such high values of
either @xmath or @xmath . Hence we present again in fig. 5.9 the allowed
regions in the @xmath plane for various fixed values of and , determined
from the dotted lines in fig. 5.1 . The solid lines in fig. 5.9 give the
99% C.L. area allowed by the SK data while the dotted lines give the
corresponding allowed region from the combined analysis of SK+CHOOZ. We
find that for the combined analysis we get allowed regions in this plane
only for much smaller values of @xmath and @xmath , which ensures that
the electron events are neither less nor more than expectations.

### 5.4 Combined Allowed Area from Short Baseline Accelerator and
Reactor Experiments

As mentioned earlier the higher mass scale of this scenario can be
explored in the accelerator based neutrino oscillation search
experiments. For the mass-pattern considered the most constraining
accelerator experiments are LSND [ 9 ] , CDHSW [ 26 ] , E531 [ 27 ] and
KARMEN [ 28 ] . Among these only LSND reported positive evidence of
oscillation. Other experiments are consistent with no-oscillation
hypothesis. Also important in this mass range are the constraints from
the reactor experiment Bugey [ 29 ] . The relevant probabilities are [
14 ]

-   Bugey

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (5.28)
      -- -------- -- --------

-   CDHSW

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (5.29)
      -- -------- -- --------

-   LSND and KARMEN

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (5.30)
      -- -------- -- --------

-   E531

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (5.31)
      -- -------- -- --------

We note that the probabilities are functions of one of the mass scales
and two mixing angles. Thus the one mass scale dominance approximation
applies. There are many analyses in the literature of the accelerator
and reactor data including LSND under this one mass scale dominance
assumption [ 14 , 30 ] . These analyses showed that when one considers
the results from the previous (prior to LSND) accelerator and reactor
experiments there are three allowed regions in the @xmath plane [ 14 ,
30 ]

-   low @xmath - low @xmath

-   low @xmath - high @xmath

-   high @xmath - @xmath unconstrained

When the LSND result was combined with these results then only the first
and the third zones remained allowed in the mass range @xmath eV @xmath
. In these earlier analyses of the accelerator and reactor data [ 14 ,
30 ] E776 [ 31 ] was more constraining than KARMEN. But with the new
data KARMEN2 gives stronger constraint than E776. Also the results from
the KARMEN2 experiment now rule out most of the region allowed by the
LSND experiment above 1 eV @xmath [ 28 ] . The LSND collaboration has
also now done a reanalysis of their entire data sample and report their
final transition probability in [ 32 ] . We have repeated the analysis
with the latest LSND and KARMEN results for one representative value of
@xmath eV @xmath and present the allowed region in fig. 5.10 .

The light-shaded area in fig. 5.10 shows the 90% C.L. allowed area in
the bilogarithmic @xmath plane from the observance of no-oscillation in
all the other above mentioned accelerator and reactor experiments except
KARMEN2. The inclusion of the KARMEN2 results as well gives the 90% C.L.
region shown by the area shaded by asterix. The 90% allowed region by
the LSND experiment is within the dashed lines. The KARMEN2 data
severely restricts the LSND allowed regions. The dotted line shows the
90% C.L. ( @xmath ) region allowed by the combined @xmath analysis of
the SK+CHOOZ data keeping @xmath and @xmath at 0.002 eV @xmath and 0.5
respectively. The combined SK atmospheric and the CHOOZ reactor data
rule out the third zone (high @xmath with @xmath unconstrained ) allowed
from LSND and other accelerator and reactor experiments. Thus if one
takes into account constraints from all experiments only a small region
in the first zone (small @xmath ) remains allowed. This common allowed
region is shown as a dark-shaded area in the fig. 5.10 . As evident from
the expression of the probabilities for the accelerator and reactor
experiments the combined allowed area of all the accelerator reactor
experiments remains the same irrespective of the value of @xmath and .
Even though the combined area in fig. 5.10 shows that in the first zone
(small @xmath ), SK+CHOOZ data allows more area in the @xmath plane for
@xmath eV @xmath and @xmath , from fig. 5.5 we see that for some other
combinations of @xmath and one does not find any allowed zones from the
SK+CHOOZ analysis, even at 99% C.L.. For those sets of values of @xmath
and the SK+CHOOZ analysis is more restrictive than the LSND and other
accelerator reactor data.

### 5.5 Implications

From our analysis of the SK atmospheric data the explicit form for the
@xmath mixing matrix @xmath at the best-fit values of parameters is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

From the combined SK+CHOOZ analysis the mixing matrix at the best-fit
values of the parameters is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

From the combined allowed area of fig. 5.10 the mixing matrix at @xmath
= 0.5 eV @xmath , @xmath eV @xmath , @xmath , @xmath = 0.001 and @xmath
= 0.5, is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

Thus the allowed scenario corresponds to the one where @xmath is close
to 1 while the states @xmath and @xmath are combinations of nearly
maximally mixed @xmath and @xmath ¹ ¹ 1 Thus this scenario is the same
as the one termed 3a in Table VI in the pre-SK analysis of [ 16 ] . In
their notation the states 2 and 3 were 1 and 2. It was disfavoured from
solar neutrino results. .

Long baseline (LBL) experiments can be useful to confirm if the
atmospheric neutrino anomaly is indeed due to neutrino oscillations,
using well monitored accelerator neutrino beams. Some of the important
LBL experiments are K2K (KEK to SK, L @xmath 250 km) [ 33 ] ² ² 2 K2K
has already presented some preliminary results [ 34 ] . , MINOS
(Fermilab to Soudan, L @xmath 730 km ) [ 35 ] and the proposed CERN to
Gran Sasso experiments (L @xmath 730 km) [ 36 ] . In this section we
explore the sensitivity of the LBL experiment K2K in probing the
parameter spaces allowed by the SK+CHOOZ and other accelerator and
reactor experiments including LSND. K2K will look for @xmath
disappearance as well as @xmath appearance. In fig. 5.11 we show the
regions in the @xmath plane that can be probed by K2K using their
projected sensitivity from [ 33 ] . The top left panel is for the
two-generation @xmath limit. The other panels are for different fixed
values of and while @xmath is fixed at 0.5 eV @xmath . For LBL
experiments the term containing @xmath averages to 0.5 as in the
atmospheric case. The solid lines in the panels show the region that can
be probed by K2K using the @xmath disappearance channel while the dotted
lines give the 90% C.L. contours allowed by SK+CHOOZ. One finds that for
for @xmath eV @xmath , the whole region allowed by SK+CHOOZ can be
probed by the @xmath disappearance channel in K2K. The dashed lines show
the 90% C.L. area that K2K can probe by the @xmath appearance mode. As
@xmath increases the constraint from the @xmath channel becomes
important as is seen in the top right panel of fig. 5.11 . However such
high values of @xmath , although allowed by SK+CHOOZ, is not favoured
when one combines LSND and other accelerator and reactor results. For
lower @xmath values allowed by all the accelerator, reactor and SK
atmospheric neutrino experiment the projected sensitivity in the @xmath
channel of K2K is not enough to probe the allowed regions in the @xmath
plane as is shown by the absence of the dashed curves in the lower
panels.

In fig. 5.12 we show the regions in the bilogarithmic @xmath plane which
can be probed by K2K. For drawing these curves we fix @xmath eV @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath eV @xmath . Shown is the area that can be explored by
the @xmath (left of the solid line) and @xmath (hatched area) channels
in K2K at 90% C.L.. The light-shaded area is allowed by SK+CHOOZ and the
dark shaded area is allowed by the combination of all the accelerator,
reactor and SK atmospheric neutrino data at 90% C.L.. It is clear from
the figure that even though the sensitivity of the @xmath appearance
channel is not enough, K2K can still probe the combined allowed region
in the @xmath plane from @xmath disappearance.

The projected sensitivities of MINOS and the CERN to ICARUS proposals
are lower than K2K and it will be interesting to check if one can probe
the regions allowed in this picture better in these experiments. However
since in our case the OMSD approximation is not applicable one has to do
the energy averaging properly to get the corresponding contours in the
three-generation parameters space, and one cannot merely scale the
allowed regions from the two-generation plots. For K2K we could use the
fig. 5 of [ 33 ] to circumvent this problem. However since the analogous
information for MINOS and CERN-Gran Sasso proposals is not available to
us we cannot check this explicitly.

An important question in this context is whether one can distinguish
between the OMSD three generation and this mass scheme. In both pictures
the SK atmospheric neutrino data can be explained by the dominant @xmath
oscillations mixed with little amount of @xmath transition. However the
mixing matrix @xmath is different. A distinction can be done if one can
measure the mixing angles very accurately.

What is the prospect in LBL experiments to distinguish between these
pictures? We give below a very preliminary and qualitative discussion on
this. If we take @xmath = 0.02, @xmath = 0.02 and @xmath = 0.5, @xmath
would be (0.038 + 0.0004 @xmath ). As the second term is negligible one
has average oscillations. This is different from the OMSD limit where
@xmath is energy dependent. If one combines the other accelerator and
reactor experiments including LSND then the allowed values of of @xmath
and @xmath are even less and choosing @xmath = 0.005, @xmath = 0.001 and
@xmath = 0.5 we get @xmath . Here also the term involving @xmath is one
order of magnitude smaller and the oscillations will be averaged. Thus
this channel has different predictions for the OMSD limit and beyond the
OMSD limit.

### 5.6 Discussions and Conclusions

In this chapter we have done a detailed @xmath analysis of the SK
atmospheric neutrino data going beyond the OMSD approximation. The mass
spectrum chosen is such that @xmath eV @xmath to explain the LSND data
and @xmath is in the range suitable for the atmospheric neutrino
problem. We study in details the implications of the earth matter
effects and bring out the essential differences of our mass pattern with
the OMSD scenario and the two-generation limits.

We first examine in detail what are the constraints obtained from only
SK data considering its overwhelming statistics. The allowed regions
include

-   the two-generation @xmath limit (both @xmath and @xmath zero)

-   regions where either @xmath or @xmath is zero; in this limit the
    probabilities are functions in general of two mixing angles and two
    mass scales.

-   the three-generation regions with all three mixing angles non-zero
    and the probabilities governed by both mass scales.

    The last two cases correspond to dominant @xmath oscillation with
    small admixture of @xmath and @xmath oscillation.

-   regions with very low @xmath ( @xmath eV @xmath ) and close to 1,
    for which the earth matter effects enhance the oscillations of the
    upward neutrinos and cause an up-down flux asymmetry. This region is
    peculiar to the mass spectrum considered by us and is absent in the
    two-generation and the OMSD pictures.

We present the zenith angle distributions of the events in these cases.
With the inclusion of the CHOOZ result the allowed ranges of the mixing
angles @xmath and @xmath is constrained more ( @xmath ), however the
allowed ranges of @xmath and @xmath do not change much (see fig. 5.1 )
except that the low @xmath region allowed by SK due to matter effects is
now disallowed. The inclusion of the constraints from LSND and other
accelerator and reactor experiments may restrict the allowed area in the
@xmath plane for certain values of @xmath and , but for some other
combinations of @xmath and , SK+CHOOZ turns out to be more constraining.
We have included the latest results from LSND and KARMEN2 in our
analysis.

In order to explain the solar neutrino problem in this picture one has
to add an extra light sterile neutrino. With the new LSND results the
allowed 4 neutrino scenarios are

-   the (2+2) picture where two degenerate mass states are separated by
    the LSND gap [ 21 , 37 , 38 , 39 ] .

-   the (3+1) scheme with three neutrino states closely degenerate in
    mass and the fourth one separated from these by the LSND gap [ 39 ,
    40 , 41 ] .

Our scenario can be easily extended to the (2+2) scheme which is still
allowed after the inclusion of the SNO results [ 42 ] . The (3+1) scheme
is however shown to be ruled out from the atmospheric data in [ 41 ] .

To conclude, one can get allowed regions from the SK atmospheric
neutrino data where both the mass scales and all the three mixing angles
are relevant. The beyond one mass scale dominance spectrum considered in
this chapter allows new regions in the low mass – low mixing regime due
to the earth matter effects. With the inclusion of the CHOOZ, LSND and
other accelerator reactor results, the allowed regions are constrained
severely. It is, in principle, possible to get some signatures in the
LBL experiments to distinguish this picture from the OMSD limit.

## Chapter 6 Decay of Atmospheric Neutrinos

In the previous chapters we have seen that neutrino flavor oscillations
in vacuum, both in two as well as three flavors, gives an excellent fit
to the SK atmospheric neutrino data. However there are other
possibilities [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] that have the potential to
explain the data, though may be not as well as @xmath oscllations do.
Nevertheless one has to rule out all these possibilities before coming
to any definite conclusion about the fate of the atmospheric neutrinos.
One among these is neutrino decay [ 8 , 9 ] .

One aspect peculiar to the oscillation hypothesis is the periodicity of
the resultant neutrino beam at the detector. But so far one has no
direct experimental evidence for this periodicity. The other way to
remove any ambiguity is to directly observe the number of @xmath
predicted by the @xmath oscillation scenario. The latest 1289 day SK
data for the upward-going sample [ 10 ] is consistent with @xmath
appearance at the @xmath level. But one needs more statistics before
coming to any final conclusion.

If one assumes the existence of a characteristic wavelength @xmath for
the vanishing @xmath such that @xmath has a power law dependence on
energy ( @xmath ) then the @xmath conversion probability can be assumed
to be parameterized as [ 11 , 12 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are free parameters. If then one
performs a most general @xmath analysis, keeping the energy exponent
@xmath a free parameter, the best-fit comes out for @xmath [ 11 , 12 ] .
In ref. [ 11 ] Fogli et al. further corroborate this feature by showing
that only an @xmath distribution can fit the muon zenith angle data [ 13
] . Hence it can be conclusively said that the data strongly prefers
theoretical models which predict a @xmath dependence for the @xmath
survival probability. Oscillations in vacuum are hugely favored since
they predict this @xmath behavior. But so does decay and it will be
interesting to check if neutrino decay can really offer a decent fit to
the observed atmospheric neutrino deficit.

In ref. [ 8 ] it was shown that neutrino decay gives a poor fit to the
data. However they considered neutrinos with zero mixing. Barger et al.
considered the situation of neutrino decay in the general case of
neutrinos with non-zero mixing angle [ 9 ] . They showed that the
neutrino decay fits the @xmath distribution of the SK data well. The
@xmath taken by them was @xmath 0.1 @xmath so that the @xmath dependent
term in the expression for the neutrino survival probability averages
out to zero. As pointed out in [ 9 ] such a constraint on @xmath is
valid when the unstable state decays into some other state with which it
mixes. If however the unstable state decays into a sterile state with
which it does not mix then there is no reason to assume @xmath @xmath eV
@xmath .

In this chapter we present our results of the neutrino decay solutions
to the atmospheric neutrino problem by doing @xmath -fit to the 848 day
of sub-GeV and multi-GeV Super-Kamiokande data [ 14 ] . We also present
the results of @xmath -fit to the 535 day SK data and compare it with
the results for the 848 day data. For the @xmath we use the definition
given by eq. ( 3.61 ) in chapter 3, where we use the double ratio @xmath
and the up-down asymmetry parameter @xmath ( @xmath ) [ 15 , 16 ] . We
first present the results of this @xmath fit for the two-generation
@xmath oscillations. For the neutrino decay analysis we take the most
general case of neutrinos with non-zero mixing and consider two pictures

-   @xmath @xmath 0.1 @xmath (scenario (a))

-   @xmath unconstrained (scenario (b))

We also explicitly demonstrate the behavior of the up-down asymmetry
parameters in both scenarios.

Our analysis shows that scenario (a) is ruled out at 100%(99.99%) C.L.
by the 848(535) day of SK data. However if we remove the constraint on
@xmath and consider the possibility of decay into a sterile state then
one can get an acceptable fit for @xmath @xmath and @xmath large.

In section 6.1 we present the most general expression for the @xmath
survival and transition probabilities with unstable neutrinos. We first
consider neutrinos to be stable and display our results for
two-generation @xmath oscillation analysis in section 6.2.1. In section
6.2.2 we present our results for the neutrino decay solution
constraining @xmath to be @xmath . In section 6.2.3 we do a three
parameter @xmath analysis by removing the constraint on @xmath . In
section 6.3 we conclude by performing a comparative study of the three
cases and indicate how one can distinguish experimentally between the
scenario (b) and the @xmath oscillation case though both give almost
identical zenith-angle distribution.

### 6.1 Neutrino Survival Probabilities

Neutrinos are assumed to be stable in the standard model of particle
physics. But if one allows for neutrino decay then the the analysis of
neutrino oscillation experiments become quite different. We will here
assume that the only unstable component is @xmath which decays into some
other lighter state @xmath which may be an active or sterile species.
Since radiative decays of neutrinos are severely constrained [ 17 ] we
consider the two possible non-radiative decay modes discussed in the
literature.

-   Model 1: If neutrinos are Dirac particles one has the decay channel
    @xmath , where @xmath is a right handed singlet and @xmath is an
    iso-singlet scaler. Thus all the final state particles for this
    model are sterile and there is no distinct signature of this decay
    apart from in disappearance experiments. This model is discussed in
    [ 18 ] . In this model a light scalar boson @xmath with lepton
    number -2 and a singlet right handed neutrino is added to the
    standard model. The neutrino coupling to this scalar boson is given
    by @xmath , @xmath being the charge conjugation operator.

-   Model 2: If neutrinos are Majorana particles, the decay mode is
    @xmath , where J is a Majoron, produced as a result of spontaneous
    breaking of a global @xmath symmetry [ 19 ] . In this model the
    neutrino masses are generated by extending the higgs sector of the
    standard model.

In both the decay scenarios the rest frame lifetime of @xmath is given
by [ 18 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the coupling constant, @xmath is the @xmath mass and
@xmath , the mass squared difference between the states that are
involved in decay. Assuming @xmath the equation ( 6.2 ) can be written
as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the decay constant related to @xmath as @xmath . We
assume a scenario where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

From eq. ( 6.5 ) the survival and transition probabilities of the @xmath
of energy E, with an unstable component @xmath , after traveling a
distance @xmath is given by,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.6)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the decay length (analogous to the oscillation
wavelength @xmath given by eq. ( 2.7 )) and is defined as,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

We see that the neutrino survival probability ( 6.6 ) depends on the
decay constant @xmath and the mass squared difference @xmath between the
states that mix, apart from the mixing angle @xmath . Hence one may
consider either @xmath , which would give pure @xmath oscillations of
stable neutrinos or @xmath non-zero, which would corresponds to the case
of decay along with oscillations. The latter may again be subdivided
into two cases depending on the value of @xmath : (a) @xmath eV @xmath
and (b) @xmath unconstrained. We present below the results for the
@xmath fits to all the three above mentioned cases. The data used for
@xmath and @xmath is shown in Table 3.5 in chapter 3.

### 6.2 Results of the @xmath analysis

#### 6.2.1 Two-Generation @xmath Oscillations

For the two flavor @xmath oscillations with the @xmath defined as in eq.
( 3.61 ) of chapter 3, the @xmath that we get for the 848 day data is
1.21 with the best-fit values as @xmath = 0.003 @xmath and @xmath = 1.0.
With six data points and two parameters this provides a good fit to the
data being allowed at 87.64%. If we use the 535 day data then the @xmath
that we get is 4.25 with the best-fit values as @xmath = 0.005 @xmath
and @xmath = 1.0, the g.o.f being 37.32%. Thus the fit becomes much
better with the 848 day data with no significant change in the best-fit
values. Though we have used a different procedure of data fitting, our
results agree well with that obtained by the SK collaboration ¹ ¹ 1 The
best-fit values that the SK collaboration had got for the 848 day data
are [ 14 ] @xmath = 0.003 eV @xmath , @xmath = 0.995 and @xmath = 55.4
for 67 d.o.f. This corresponds to a g.o.f of 84.33%. .

#### 6.2.2 Neutrino Decay with @xmath eV@xmath

If the unstable component in the @xmath state decays to some other state
with which it mixes then bounds from @xmath decays imply @xmath eV
@xmath [ 20 ] . In this case the @xmath term averages to zero and the
probability becomes

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

In figs. 6.1 and 6.2 we show the variation of @xmath and @xmath with
@xmath for various values of @xmath for the sub-GeV and multi-GeV cases.
For higher values of @xmath , the decay length @xmath given by eq. ( 6.8
) is low and the exponential term in the survival probability is less
implying that more number of neutrinos decay and hence @xmath is low. As
@xmath decreases the decay length increases and the number of decaying
neutrinos decreases, increasing @xmath . For very low values of @xmath
the exponential term goes to 1, the neutrinos do not get the time to
decay so that the probability becomes @xmath and remains constant
thereafter for all lower values of @xmath . This is to be contrasted
with the @xmath oscillation case where in the no oscillation limit the
@xmath term @xmath 0 and the survival probability @xmath 1. For
multi-GeV neutrinos since the energy is higher the @xmath is higher and
the no decay limit is reached for a larger value of @xmath as compared
to the sub-GeV case. This explains why the multi-GeV curves become
flatter at a higher @xmath . The behavior of the up-down asymmetry
parameter is also completely different from the only oscillation case [
21 ] . In particular the plateau obtained for a range of @xmath which
was considered as a characteristic prediction for up-down asymmetries is
missing here. For the decay case even for @xmath as high as 0.001 @xmath
, the decay length @xmath /GeV) km so that the exponential term is 1,
there is almost no decay for the downward neutrinos and the survival
probability is @xmath while the upward going neutrinos have some decay
and so @xmath is less than 1. As @xmath decreases, the @xmath increases,
and the fraction of upward going neutrinos decaying decreases and this
increases @xmath . For very small values of @xmath even the upward
neutrinos do not decay and @xmath 1 being independent of @xmath .

We also perform a @xmath analysis of the data calculating the “th”
quantities in ( 3.61 ) for this scenario. For the 848 day data the
best-fit values that we get are @xmath in @xmath and @xmath with a
@xmath of 49.16. For 4 degrees of freedom this solution is ruled out at
100%. The best-fit values for the 535 day of data that we get are @xmath
in @xmath and @xmath with a @xmath of 31.71. For 4 degrees of freedom
this solution is ruled out at 99.99% [ 22 ] . Thus the fit becomes worse
with the 848 day data as compared to the 535 day data. We have marked
the @xmath and @xmath corresponding to the best-fit value of the
parameters @xmath and @xmath in figs. 6.1 and 6.2 . It can be seen that
the best-fit value of R for the sub-GeV neutrinos is just below and that
for the multi-GeV neutrinos is just above the @xmath allowed band of the
SK 848 day of data. The up-down asymmetry parameter @xmath is quite low
for the sub-GeV neutrinos and extremely high for the multi-GeV neutrinos
as compared to that allowed by the data. The fig. 6.1 shows that for the
sub-GeV neutrinos the data demands a lower value of @xmath while from
fig. 6.2 we see that the multi-GeV neutrinos need a much higher @xmath
to explain the SK data. It is not possible to get an @xmath that can
satisfy both the sub-GeV and the multi-GeV SK data, particularly its
zenith angle distribution. In this scenario, decay for the sub-GeV
upward neutrinos is more than that for the multi-GeV upward neutrinos
(downward neutrinos do not decay much) and as a result @xmath for
sub-GeV is lower than the @xmath for multi-GeV, a fact not supported by
the data. Since the 848 day data needs even lesser depletion of the
sub-GeV flux as compared to the multi-GeV flux, the fit gets worse.

#### 6.2.3 Neutrino Decay with @xmath unconstrained

In this section we present the results of our @xmath -analysis removing
the constraint on @xmath . This case corresponds to the unstable
neutrino state decaying to some sterile state with which it does not mix
[ 9 ] . The probability will be still given by eq. ( 6.6 ).

In fig. 6.3 and 6.4 we plot the R vs. @xmath and Y vs. @xmath for the
sub-GeV and multi-GeV data for @xmath = 0.3 @xmath (which is the
best-fit value we get for the 848 day data) and compare with the curve
obtained for the best-fit value of @xmath (=0.5) for the only
oscillation case (solid line). For the best-fit value of @xmath that we
get, the downward neutrinos do not have time to decay while the upward
neutrinos undergo very little decay. Thus the curves are very similar in
nature to the only oscillation curves. In the sub-GeV case (fig. 6.3 ),
for high values of @xmath around 0.1 @xmath both upward and downward
neutrinos undergo @xmath independent average oscillations and R stays
more or less constant with @xmath . For the upward going neutrinos in
addition to average oscillation there is little amount of decay as well
and hence Y @xmath @xmath is @xmath 1. As @xmath decreases to about 0.05
@xmath the oscillation wavelength increases – for upward neutrinos it is
still average oscillation but for the downward neutrinos, the @xmath
term becomes negative which corresponds to maximum oscillation effect
and the survival probability of these neutrinos decreases, and hence R
decreases; while the upward neutrinos continue to decay and oscillate at
the same rate and @xmath becomes greater than 1. As @xmath decreases
further, the downward neutrino oscillation wavelength becomes greater
than the distance traversed and they are converted less and less and
thus R increases and Y decreases. Below @xmath = 0.001 @xmath the
downward neutrinos stop oscillating completely while for the upward
neutrinos the @xmath term goes to 1, and R and Y no longer vary much
with @xmath .

For the multi-GeV case (fig. 6.4 ) the oscillation wavelength is more
than the sub-GeV case and for @xmath around 0.1 @xmath the @xmath term
stays close to 1 for the downward neutrinos; while the upward neutrinos
undergo average oscillations and slight decay and Y is less than 1. As
@xmath decreases the downward neutrinos oscillate even less and the
upward neutrinos also start departing from average oscillations and
hence @xmath increases and @xmath decreases. Around 0.01 @xmath the
downward neutrinos stop oscillation while for upward neutrinos the
oscillation effect is maximum ( @xmath ) and the @xmath term is @xmath
-1 and @xmath stays constant with @xmath . As @xmath decreases further
the upward neutrino oscillation wavelength increases and they oscillate
less in number making both R and Y approach 1 for @xmath around 0.0001
@xmath . For multi-GeV neutrinos the decay term contributes even less as
compared to the sub-GeV case.

We perform a @xmath minimization in the three parameters @xmath , @xmath
and @xmath . The best-fit values that we get for the 848 day data are
@xmath , @xmath = 1.0 and @xmath . The @xmath minimum that we get is
1.11 which is an acceptable fit being allowed at 77.46%. For the 535 day
data the best-fit values that we get are @xmath , @xmath = 0.87 and
@xmath with a @xmath of 4.14 which is allowed at 24.67%. Thus compared
to the 535 day data, the fit improves immensely and the best-fit shifts
towards the oscillation limit, the best-fit value of the decay constant
@xmath being much lower now. It is to be noted however, that the
best-fit in this model does not come out to be @xmath , viz the only
oscillation limit. In Table 6.1 we give the contributions to @xmath from
the @xmath ’s and @xmath ’s at the best-fit value of @xmath and for the
@xmath = 0.0 case.

Thus from the contributions to @xmath we see that for the best- fit case
there is improvement for the multi-GeV @xmath and @xmath as compared to
the @xmath case. The @xmath for sub-GeV @xmath also improves. In fig.
6.5 we plot @xmath vs. @xmath with @xmath and @xmath unconstrained.
There are two distinct minima in this curve – one for lower values and
another at higher values of @xmath . The best-fit @xmath in both cases
is @xmath 0.001 @xmath . In this model there are two competing processes
– oscillation and decay. For lower values of @xmath the decay length is
greater than the the oscillation wavelength and oscillation dominates.
The decay term exp @xmath is close to 1 and does not vary much with the
zenith distance @xmath . As @xmath increases the exponential term starts
varying very sharply with @xmath and the variation is much more sharp
for the sub-GeV as compared to multi-GeV. This behavior is inconsistent
with the data and that is why one gets a peak in @xmath for higher
@xmath . As @xmath increases further the exp @xmath term goes to zero
for the upward neutrinos and there is complete decay of these neutrinos
while the downward neutrinos do not decay, the exponential term still
being 1. Whenever the exponential term is 0 or 1 for the upward
neutrinos, the wrong energy dependence of this term does not spoil the
fit and these scenarios can give good fit to the data. Even though fig.
6.5 shows that the data allows a wide range of @xmath , we get the two
distinct minima in the @xmath vs. @xmath curve for high and low @xmath
values, for both the 535 day (dotted line) and 848 day (solid line)
data. But while the 848 day data prefers the lower @xmath limit, the 535
day data gives a better fit for the high @xmath limit. The reason behind
this is that for the 848 day data the R is much higher than for the 535
day data. Hence the 848 day data prefers lower @xmath and hence lower
suppression.

In fig. 6.6 we show the 90% and 99% C.L. allowed parameter region in the
@xmath - @xmath plane for a range of values of the parameter @xmath . In
fig. 6.7 we show the 90% and 99% C.L. contours in the @xmath - @xmath
plane fixing @xmath at different values. These contours are obtained
from the definition @xmath , with @xmath = 6.25 and 15.5 for the three
parameter case for 90% and 99% C.L. respectively. The bottom left panel
in fig. 6.6 is for the best-fit value of @xmath . For high @xmath (the
top left panel) no lower limit is obtained on @xmath , because even if
@xmath becomes so low so that there is no oscillation the complete decay
of upward neutrinos can explain their depletion. As we decrease @xmath
the allowed parameter region shrinks and finally for @xmath we get the
two parameter limit modulo the small difference in the C.L. definitions
for the two and three parameter cases. The upper right panel of fig. 6.7
corresponds to the best-fit value of @xmath . For very low @xmath , even
though there is no decay, we still have oscillations and that ensures
that when @xmath is large enough there is no lower bound on @xmath as
evident in the fig. 6.7 . For @xmath @xmath the neutrinos stop
oscillating and hence we get a lower bound on @xmath beyond which the
depletion in the neutrino flux is not enough to explain the data.

### 6.3 Comparisons and Discussions

In fig. 6.8 we show the histogram of the muon event distributions for
the sub-GeV and multi-GeV data under the assumptions of @xmath
oscillation, and the two scenarios of neutrino decay for the best-fit
values of the parameters both for the 535 and the 848 day of data. From
the figures it is clearly seen that the scenario (a) (big dashed line) (
@xmath ) does not fit the data well there being too much suppression for
the sub-GeV upward going neutrinos and too less suppression for the
multi-GeV upward going neutrinos. The scenario (b) ( @xmath
unconstrained, small dashed line), however, reproduces the event
distributions well. However with the 848 day data the sub-GeV events are
reproduced better as compared to the 535 day data and the quality of the
fit improves.

The neutrino decay is an interesting idea as it can preferentially
suppress the upward @xmath flux and can cause some up-down asymmetry in
the atmospheric neutrino data. However the intrinsic defect in the decay
term @xmath is that one has more decay for lower energy neutrinos than
for the higher energy ones. Thus neutrino decay by itself fails to
reproduce the observed data [ 8 ] . If however one considers the most
general case of neutrinos with non-zero mixing then there are three
factors which control the situation

-   the decay constant @xmath which determines the decay rate

-   the mixing angle @xmath which determines the proportion of neutrinos
    decaying and mixing with the other flavour

-   the @xmath which determines if there are oscillations as well

If the heavier state decays to a state with which it mixes then @xmath
has to be @xmath because of bounds coming from @xmath decays [ 20 ] .
The best-fit value of @xmath that one gets is @xmath with the 848 day SK
data. At this value of @xmath the @xmath term tends to 1 for the
downward going neutrinos signifying that they do not decay much. The
survival probability goes to ( @xmath ) which is just the average
oscillation probability. In order to suppress this average oscillation
the best-fit value of @xmath comes out to be small in this picture. For
the upward going neutrinos, in scenario (a), there will be both decay
and average oscillations. If one had only average oscillation then the
probability would have stayed constant for a fixed value of the mixing
angle @xmath . But because of the exponential decay term the survival
probability drops very sharply as we go towards @xmath . The drop and
hence the decay is more for lower energy neutrinos. As a result the
sub-GeV flux gets more depleted than the multi-GeV flux, a fact not
supported by the data. In fact the 848 day data requires the sub-GeV
flux to be even less suppressed than the multi-GeV flux as compared to
the 535 day data and the fit worsens with the 848 day data. The small
mixing signifies that the @xmath has a large fraction of the unstable
component @xmath (see eq. ( 6.5 )). Hence the constant @xmath comes out
to be low so that the decay rate is less to compensate this. However
even at the best-fit @xmath of 0.33 @xmath the survival probability in
the bin with @xmath between @xmath to @xmath comes out to be 0.15 for
E=1 GeV, much lower than the value of @xmath 0.5 as required by the
data. Thus scenario (a) fails to explain the upward going neutrino data
properly because of two main reasons

-   @xmath is low in order to suppress the average oscillations of the
    downward neutrinos

-   the energy dependence of the exponential decay term is in conflict
    with the data

In the scenario (b), in addition to mixing with @xmath , the unstable
component in @xmath decays to some sterile state with which it does not
mix. In this case there is no restriction on @xmath and it enters the
@xmath fit as an independent parameter. We find that:

-   The best-fit @xmath does not come out naturally to be in the @xmath
    independent average oscillation regime of @xmath 0.1 @xmath , rather
    it is @xmath .

-   The best-fit value of the decay constant @xmath implying that the
    decay rate is small so that the mixing angle is maximal ( @xmath ).

-   Large values of @xmath giving complete decay of upward neutrinos are
    also allowed with a high C.L. In fact with 535 day data the best-fit
    was in this region.

-   The best-fit value of the decay constant @xmath is non-zero
    signifying that a little amount of decay combined with @xmath
    dependent oscillations gives a better fit to the data.

At the best-fit values of the parameters there is no oscillation of the
downward neutrinos so that the @xmath term goes to 1. The decay term
also goes to 1 signifying that there is not much decay either for the
downward neutrinos and the survival probability is @xmath 1 without
requiring the mixing angle to be low. On the other hand for the upward
neutrinos there are oscillations as well as little amount of decay. The
sub-GeV upward neutrinos have smaller oscillation wavelength and they
are close to the average oscillation limit (survival probability @xmath
0.5) while for the multi-GeV neutrinos the oscillation wavelength is
such that one has maximum oscillations and the survival probability is
less than 0.5. Thus this scenario reproduces the correct energy
dependence of the suppression – namely sub-GeV is suppressed less as
compared to multi-GeV neutrinos. The best-fit value of @xmath being even
smaller now than the scenario (a) the decay term @xmath does not vary
very sharply with the zenith distance @xmath or the energy @xmath so
that its wrong energy dependence does not spoil the fit.

The conversion probability of @xmath to @xmath is given by eq. ( 6.7 ).
The value of @xmath integrated over the energy and the zenith angle, for
@xmath (the best fit for scenario (b)) is 0.33 for sub-GeV and 0.26 for
multi-GeV. For @xmath (the second minima in the @xmath vs. @xmath curve)
the corresponding numbers are 0.21 and 0.15, while for the only @xmath
oscillation case, the corresponding values are 0.37 and 0.26
respectively. The values of @xmath and @xmath for all the cases are
taken as @xmath and 1.0 respectively.

The fig. 6.8 shows that the zenith angle dependence of the scenario (b)
is almost similar to the case of @xmath oscillation. But the two cases
are very different in principle. For the oscillation case a larger
@xmath implies a larger conversion whereas in scenario (b) a larger
@xmath means the fraction of the unstable component is less in @xmath
and the depletion is less. If one compares the conversion probability as
given by eq.( 6.7 ) with the one for the @xmath oscillation case, then
the scenario (b) considered in this chapter would have smaller number of
@xmath s in the resultant flux at the detector, especially for the
larger values of @xmath which are still allowed by the data and the two
cases might be distinguished when one has enough statistics to detect
@xmath appearance in Super-Kamiokande [ 10 , 23 ] or from neutral
current events [ 24 ] .

In this chapter we have followed the procedure of data fitting as done
in [ 16 ] . Thus we use the ratios for which the common systematic
errors get canceled out. Strictly speaking one should use the absolute
number of events and include all the correlations between bins and
@xmath -like and @xmath -like events. But the best-fit points and the
allowed regions are not expected to change significantly. We have
compared the scenarios of neutrino oscillation and decay with the same
definition of @xmath and for this purpose of comparison neglecting the
correlation matrix will not make much difference. Apart from the
statistical analysis we have given plots of @xmath and @xmath for
various values of the parameters. The allowed parameter ranges from
these plots are consistent with what we get from our statistical
analysis. The histograms that we have plotted are also independent of
our definition of @xmath . We have checked that if we estimate the
allowed ranges from the histograms these are consistent with what we get
from our definition of @xmath . Thus we agree with the observation in
ref. [ 16 ] that although this method of data fitting is approximate it
works well.

In [ 25 ] the authors have considered another scenario where @xmath eV
@xmath and have obtained good fits to the SK data. They have also
discussed in details the neutrino decay models and the consequences of
such models for astrophysics and cosmology.

## Chapter 7 Massive Neutrinos in Supernova

The core of a massive star @xmath starts collapsing once it runs out of
nuclear fuel. The collapse continues to densities beyond the nuclear
matter density after which a bouncing of the infalling matter takes
place leading to supernova explosion and the formation of a protoneutron
star [ 1 ] . Only a small fraction of the huge gravitational energy
released in the process goes into the explosion and all the rest of the
energy is carried away by neutrinos and antineutrinos of all three
flavors. About @xmath neutrinos, in all three flavors carrying a few
times @xmath ergs of energy are released in a type II supernova. The
luminosities of all the neutrino species are almost same while the
average energies are approximately 11 MeV for @xmath , 16 MeV for @xmath
and the average energy of @xmath and @xmath and their antiparticles is
25 MeV [ 2 ] . These neutrinos for galactic supernova events can be
detected by the current water @xmath erenkov detectors, the
Super-Kamiokande (SK) and the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) [ 3 ] .
In contrast to the solar, the atmospheric as well as the
accelerator/reactor neutrinos where one has neutrino flux of a single
flavor at the source, postbounce supernova neutrinos (antineutrinos)
start from the source in all three flavors but with @xmath ( @xmath )
having average energies more than that for @xmath and it is an
interesting problem to study whether their flux and their signal at the
terrestrial @xmath detectors get appreciably altered in reaching the
earth if neutrinos do oscillate.

The detection of the SN1987A neutrinos by the water @xmath
erenkov detectors at Kamioka [ 4 ] and IMB [ 5 ] settled many important
issues in the subject of type II supernova theory. The observation of
neutrinos from any future galactic supernova event will answer the
remaining questions regarding the understanding of the supernova
mechanisms. A galactic supernova event will also bring in a lot of
information on neutrino mass, which of late, has been an issue of much
discussion. The effect of neutrino mass can show up in the observed
neutrino signal in these detectors in two ways,

-   by causing delay in the time of flight measurements

-   by modifying the neutrino spectra through neutrino flavor mixing

Massive neutrinos travel with speed less than the speed of light and for
typical galactic supernova distances @xmath 10 kpc, even a small mass
results in a measurable delay in the arrival time of the neutrino. Many
different analyses have been performed before to give bounds on the
neutrino mass by looking at this delay in the arrival time of the
massive neutrinos ( [ 6 , 7 ] and references therein). Neutrino
oscillations on the other hand convert the more energetic @xmath into
@xmath thereby hardening the resultant @xmath energy spectra and hence
enhancing their signal at the detector [ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 ] . In
this chapter we give quantitative predictions for the number of neutrino
events coming from a typical type II supernova at a distance of 10kpc in
both SNO and SK and show how the number of events for each detection
process would change in case oscillations do take place. We study in
detail the effect of neutrino mass and mixing on the total number of
events recorded in the detector, the distortion of the neutrino spectra
due to oscillations, the effect of delay due to neutrino mass on the
time response of the signal and the effect of oscillations on the delay
due to mass recorded at the detector.

The water @xmath erenkov detectors detect neutrinos through various
charged and neutral current processes. The differential number of
neutrino events at the detector for a given reaction process is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath runs over the neutrino species concerned, @xmath , are the
number of neutrinos produced at the source where @xmath is the neutrino
luminosity and @xmath is the average energy, @xmath is the reaction
cross-section for the neutrino with the target particle, @xmath is the
distance of the neutrino source from the detector (taken as 10kpc),
@xmath is the number of detector particles for the reaction considered
and @xmath is the energy spectrum for the neutrino species involved,
while @xmath is the detector efficiency as a function of the neutrino
energy. By integrating out the energy from eq.( 7.1 ) we get the time
dependence of the various reactions at the detector. To get the total
numbers both integrations over energy and time has to be done.

In section 7.1 we use the eq. ( 7.1 ) to estimate the signal that a
future galactic supernova event would register in SK and SNO, using the
luminosities and average energies from a realistic @xmath supernova
model. We consider a scheme of neutrino mass and mixing such that one
has almost pure vacuum oscillations and study its effect on the neutrino
spectrum and hence on the signal at the detector. We next consider in
section 7.2 a neutrino mass spectrum where one of the neutrino masses is
in the eV range and we study the effect of delay in the arrival time on
the neutrino signal for both with and without the presence of neutrino
flavor mixing. We end this chapter by drawing the main conclusions in
section 7.3.

### 7.1 Effect of Neutrino Oscillations in Vacuum

There have been various attempts before to estimate the effect of
non-zero neutrino mass and mixing on the expected neutrino signal from a
galactic supernova. Matter enhanced resonant flavor conversion has been
observed to have a large effect on the @xmath signal [ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ,
12 , 13 ] . The @xmath events of course remain unchanged in this case.
With vacuum oscillations we can expect an increase in both the @xmath
and @xmath signal. Burrows et al. [ 9 ] have considered for SNO, the
effect of vacuum oscillations as well and have found that with
two-flavors the effect of vacuum oscillations on the signal is small,
using their model predictions for the different @xmath luminosities.

We have considered a three-generation mixing scheme and have calculated
the effect of neutrino oscillations on the signal from a 20 @xmath
supernova model developed recently [ 14 ] by Totani et al. based on the
hydrodynamic code developed by Wilson and Mayle. For the neutrino
luminosities and average energies we use the model predictions from [ 14
] . Though in their paper Totani et al. observe that the neutrino
spectrum is not a pure black body, but we as a first approximation use a
Fermi-Dirac spectrum for the neutrinos, characterized by the @xmath
temperature alone for simplicity. The effect of a chemical potential is
to cut the high energy tail of the neutrino spectrum and we also study
its effect on the the @xmath signal and on the enhancement of the signal
when oscillations are introduced.

For the mass and mixing parameters we consider two scenarios

@xmath Scenario 1: First we do our calculations for the threefold
maximal mixing model [ 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ] consistent with the solar (
@xmath eV @xmath ) and the atmospheric neutrino data ( @xmath eV @xmath
). For @xmath eV @xmath normally we expect matter enhanced resonance in
the supernova. But for the particular case of maximal mixing it has been
shown before, both numerically [ 19 ] and analytically [ 20 ] , that
there are no discernable matter effects in the resultant neutrino
spectrum on earth. Though the arguments in both these previous papers
are for solar neutrinos, extension to the case of supernova neutrinos is
straightforward. Hence we are concerned with vacuum oscillations only.
Since the oscillation wavelengths (cf. eq. ( 2.7 )) corresponding to
both the mass scales are much smaller compared to the Earth–supernova
distance @xmath , the oscillation probabilities reduce to [ 16 , 17 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

We call this case 1.

@xmath Scenario 2: Here we set @xmath eV @xmath for which @xmath and
hence the oscillation effects are observable in the neutrino spectrum.
The other mass range in kept in the solar vacuum oscillation regime
@xmath eV @xmath . For this case the oscillations due to @xmath and
@xmath are averaged out as the neutrinos travel to Earth but those due
to @xmath survive. In this scenario again there is no matter effects and
one has vacuum oscillations. The transition and survival probabilities
in this case are

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

We use the for the mixing matrix @xmath , where @xmath have been defined
before in chapter 5. For @xmath we consider two sets of values allowed
by the solar @xmath data. We have done our calculations for @xmath = 1.0
and @xmath = 0.75. The first set is called Case 2a while the second is
called Case 2b. Since nothing constrains @xmath in this scenario we can
vary @xmath and study its effect on the @xmath signal. We have tabulated
our results for @xmath = 1.0 since it gives the maximum increase in the
signal from the no oscillation value.

The corresponding expressions for the antineutrinos will be identical.
We note that because the energy spectra of the @xmath and @xmath are
identical, we do not need to distinguish them and keep the combination
@xmath . We have made here a three-generation analysis where all the
three neutrino flavors are active. Hence if both the solar @xmath
problem and the atmospheric @xmath anomaly require @xmath oscillation
solutions, then in the scenario 2 , the atmospheric data has to be
reproduced by @xmath oscillations ¹ ¹ 1 The pure @xmath solution to the
atmospheric neutrino problem is now disfavored from the SK atmospheric
data [ 21 ] . However schemes in which @xmath can oscillate into a
combination of active and sterile species are still allowed [ 22 ] . .
We are interested in this scenario as only with neutrinos from a
supernova can one probe very small mass square differences @xmath eV
@xmath . To find the number of events with oscillations we will have to
fold the expression ( 7.1 ) with the expressions for survival and
transition probabilities for the neutrinos for all the cases considered.

In Table 7.1 we report the calculated number of expected events for the
main reactions in @xmath and @xmath . Column 2 of Table 7.1 gives the
expected numbers for the supernova model under consideration when the
neutrino masses are assumed to be zero. Column 3,4,5 give the
corresponding numbers for the two scenarios of neutrino mixing that we
have considered (see Table 7.1 for details). All the numbers tabulated
have been calculated for 1 kton of detector mass. To get the actual
numbers we have to multiply these numbers with the relevant fiducial
mass of the detector. The efficiency of both the detectors (SNO and SK)
is taken to be 1 [ 6 , 7 , 14 ] . The energy threshold is taken to be 5
MeV for both SK [ 6 ] and SNO [ 7 ] . The energy threshold of SNO in the
recently declared solar neutrino results is 6.75 MeV [ 23 ] . For the
cross-section of the @xmath and @xmath reactions we refer to [ 24 ] .
The cross-section of the @xmath and @xmath scattering has been taken
from [ 25 ] while the neutral current @xmath scattering cross-section is
taken from [ 6 ] . For the @xmath and @xmath reactions we refer to [ 26
] where we have used the cross-sections for the detector with perfect
efficiency. From a comparison of the predicted numbers in Table 7.1 , it
is evident that neutrino oscillations play a significant role in
supernova neutrino detection. For the neutral current sector the number
of events remain unchanged as the interaction is flavor blind.

The 32 kton of pure water in SK detects neutrinos primarily through the
capture of @xmath on protons ( @xmath ) and @xmath scattering. The
energy threshold for @xmath is 15.4 MeV and that for @xmath is 11.4 MeV,
hence these reactions are important only for very high energy neutrinos.
The typical average energies of @xmath and @xmath from a type II
supernova is about 11 MeV and 16 MeV respectively, so we do not expect
significant contribution from these two reactions. This is evident from
Table 7.1 where the @xmath events are only 2.1% of the total charge
current signal at SK. As a result of mixing the mu and tau neutrinos and
antineutrinos oscillate (with average energy @xmath 25 MeV) into @xmath
and @xmath during their flight from the galactic supernova to the
detector resulting in higher energy @xmath and @xmath and the number of
@xmath events are increased appreciably (for Case 1 @xmath events go up
by 13 times) so that after oscillations they are 7% (Case 1) of the
total charge current events at SK. The effect of oscillations on the (
@xmath -p) capture is to enhance the expected signal by about 25% (Case
1). In all previous studies where the effect of MSW transition on the
neutrino signal has been studied [ 13 , 10 ] , there is no enhancement
in the number of expected events for the ( @xmath -p) sector while we do
get a significant change in the expected signal with vacuum
oscillations. For the ( @xmath ) scattering the effect of oscillation is
very small.

The SNO is the world’s first heavy water detector made of 1 kton of pure
@xmath surrounded by ultra pure @xmath . We find about 99% increase in
@xmath events and about 46% increase in @xmath events for the Case 1.
From the column 2 of Table 7.1 we can see that there are more @xmath
than @xmath events even though there are more @xmath than @xmath coming
from the supernova. This is because the reaction cross-section @xmath
and the @xmath spectrum is harder than the @xmath spectrum. This also
results in a greater enhancement due to oscillations for the @xmath
events, as the difference between the energies of the @xmath and @xmath
is greater than those between @xmath and @xmath and hence the effect on
the @xmath events is more. As a result after oscillations are switched
on the number of @xmath events supersede the @xmath events. We observe a
similar effect for the @xmath events, where the @xmath signal without
oscillations is more than the @xmath signal, while the effect of
oscillations is more for the latter. The effect is more magnified in
this case due to the very strong energy dependence of the reaction
cross-section and also due to the fact that the energy threshold for
@xmath event is lower than for the @xmath event. In fig. 7.1 we plot the
signal due to the ( @xmath ) events as a function of neutrino energy,
without oscillations and with oscillations for the Case 1 and Case 2b.
All the features mentioned are clearly seen. The plot for the Case 2b
clearly shows oscillations.

In fig. 7.2 we plot the cumulative fluence of the @xmath coming from the
supernova at 10 kpc without oscillations and with oscillations for Case
1 and Case 2b. It is seen that the result of oscillation in fact is to
reduce the total number of @xmath . Yet as seen from Table 7.1 , we have
obtained significant increase in the @xmath events and the @xmath
events. The solution to this apparent anomaly lies in the fact that the
cross-section of these reactions are strongly energy dependent. As a
result of oscillations the @xmath flux though depleted in number, gets
enriched in high energy neutrinos. It is these higher energy neutrinos
which enhance the @xmath signal at the detector. This also explains the
difference in the degree of enhancement for the different processes. For
the @xmath and @xmath events, especially for the latter, the effect is
huge while for the @xmath scattering it is negligible as its reaction
cross-section is only linearly proportional to the neutrino energy. Due
to their high energy dependent cross-sections the @xmath events turn out
to be extremely sensitive to oscillations. A similar argument holds true
for the case of the antineutrinos, only here the effect of oscillations
is less than in the case for the neutrinos as the difference between the
energies of the @xmath and @xmath is comparatively less as discussed
earlier.

For the scenario 2 we have studied the effect of the mixing angles on
the signal. For a fixed @xmath the effect of oscillations is enhanced if
we raise @xmath . The effect of @xmath is more subtle. The effect of
oscillations increase with @xmath initially and then decrease. We have
also checked the effect of a chemical potential @xmath on the neutrino
signal. A non-zero @xmath cuts the high energy tail of the neutrino
signal as a result of which the total signal goes down for both with and
without oscillations, the effect being greater for the more energy
sensitive reactions.

With the supernova model of Totani et al. [ 14 ] , we have obtained
oscillation effects in the expected @xmath signal which are
significantly larger than those obtained by Burrows et al. [ 3 , 9 ] .
In the model that Burrows et al. use in their study, the @xmath
luminosities @xmath are more than those for Totani et al. model, but the
average energy is much smaller, particularly for the @xmath and @xmath .
Hence their @xmath spectra lacks in high energy neutrinos which results
in almost negligible effect of oscillations in their case. Again in the
model of Burrows et al. the average energies decrease with time while in
the model of Totani et al. not only the average energies but also the
difference between the average energies of @xmath and @xmath increases
with time. The effect of all these is to magnify the effect of
oscillations in our case.

### 7.2 The Effect of Delay in the Time of Flight

In the previous section we studied the effects of neutrino flavor
oscillations on the supernova neutrino spectrum and the number of
charged current events at the detector using a realistic supernova
model. In this section we study the neutral current signal as a function
of time in the water Cerenkov detectors, for a mass range of the
neutrinos where both the phenomenon of delay and flavor conversion are
operative. That the time response of the event rate in the detector is
modified if the neutrinos have mass alone and hence delay is a well
known feature [ 6 , 7 ] . Here we stress the point that since neutrino
flavor conversions change the energy spectra of the neutrinos, and since
the time delay of the massive neutrinos is energy dependent, the time
dependence of the event rate at the detector is altered appreciably in
the presence of mixing. We suggest various variables which act as tools
for measuring this change in the time response curve of the neutral
current events and in differentiating the cases of (a) massless
neutrinos (b) neutrinos with mass but no mixing and (c) neutrinos with
mass as well as mixing. In particular we study the ratio of the charged
current to neutral current ratio R(t), as a function of time in the SNO
detector and show that the change in the value and the shape of R(t) due
to flavor mixing cannot be emulated by uncertainties. We also study
other variables like the normalized @xmath -th energy moments of the
neutral current events and the ratio of charged to the neutral current
@xmath -th moments as important diagnostic tools in filtering out the
effects of neutrino mass and mixing.

For the neutrino luminosities and average energies, though it is best to
use a numerical supernova model, but for simplicity, we will here use a
profile of the neutrino luminosities and temperatures which have general
agreement with most supernova models. We take the total supernova energy
radiated in neutrinos to be 3 @xmath ergs. This luminosity, which is
almost the same for all the neutrino species, has a fast rise over a
period of 0.1 sec followed by a slow fall over several seconds in most
supernova models. We use a luminosity that has a rise in 0.1 sec using
one side of the Gaussian with @xmath = 0.03 and then an exponential
decay with time constant @xmath = 3 sec for all the flavors [ 6 , 7 ] .

The average energies associated with the @xmath (the @xmath have the
same energy spectra) are 11 MeV, 16 MeV and 25 MeV respectively in most
numerical models. We take these average energies and consider them to be
constant in time. We have also checked our calculations with time
dependent average energies and estimated its effect. The neutrino
spectrum is taken to be a pure Fermi-Dirac distribution characterized by
the neutrino temperature alone.

If the neutrinos are massless then the time response of their signal at
the detector reflect just the time dependence of their luminosity
function at the source, which is the same for all the three flavors and
hence the same for the charged current and neutral current reactions. If
neutrinos have mass @xmath eV then they pick up a measurable delay
during their course of flight from the supernova to the earth. For a
neutrino of mass m (in eV) and energy E (in MeV), the delay (in sec) in
traveling a distance D (in 10 kpc) is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we have neglected all the small higher order terms. The time
response curve then has contributions from both the luminosity and the
mass. We will now consider a scheme of neutrino masses such that @xmath
eV @xmath consistent with the LMA MSW solution of the solar neutrino
problem and @xmath eV @xmath . For @xmath eV @xmath the effect of Earth
matter can show up in the neutrino signal [ 27 ] but we neglect it here
for simplicity. The neutrino mass model considered here is one of
several, given for the purpose of illustration only. In this scheme the
atmospheric neutrino anomaly will have to be explained by the @xmath
oscillation mode. The mass range for the neutrinos as the hot component
of hot plus cold dark matter scenario in cosmology is a few eV only [ 28
] , which will conflict with the higher values in the range of @xmath eV
that we consider here if @xmath is stable. Hence, we assume that the
@xmath state is unstable but with a large enough life time so that it is
does not conflict with the observations of SN 1987A [ 29 ] (even though
SN1987A observations did not correspond to any @xmath event, one can put
limits on the @xmath lifetime as the @xmath state is a mixture of all
the three mass eigenstates) and is also consistent with Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis. In fact, from the ref. [ 6 , 7 ] we know that using the
time delay technique, the SK and SNO can be used to probe neutrino
masses down to only 50 eV and 30 eV respectively. Hence we have
presented all our results for a particular representative value of
@xmath eV. There have been proposals in the past for an unstable
neutrino with mass @xmath eV and lifetime @xmath s [ 30 ] . Since direct
kinematical measurements give @xmath eV [ 31 ] , we have taken the
@xmath to be massless and the charged current events experience no
change. But since the @xmath pick up a detectable time delay (for the
mass spectrum of the neutrinos that we consider here, the @xmath do not
have measurable time delay), the expression for the neutral current
events gets modified to,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.7)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

where @xmath denotes the neutral current @xmath event rate with delay
@xmath . Delay therefore distorts the neutral current event rate vs.
time curve. By doing a @xmath analysis of this shape distortion one can
put limits on the @xmath mass [ 6 , 7 ] .

We next consider the neutrinos to have flavor mixing as well. The mixing
angle @xmath can be constrained from the solar neutrino data (cf.
chapter 3) while for @xmath there is no experimental data to fall back
upon, but from r-process considerations in the ‘hot bubble” of the
supernova, one can restrict @xmath [ 2 , 10 ] . In this scenario there
will be first a matter enhanced @xmath resonance in the mantle of the
supernova followed by a @xmath resonance in the envelope. The MSW
mechanism in the supernova for the neutrino mass scheme that we consider
here is discussed in details in ref. [ 10 ] . As the average energy of
the @xmath is greater than the average energy of the @xmath , neutrino
flavor mixing modifies their energy spectrum. Hence as pointed out in
the previous section the @xmath flux though depleted in number, gets
enriched in high energy neutrinos and since the detection cross-sections
are strongly energy dependent, this results in the enhancement of the
charged current signal. The total number of events in SNO, integrated
over time in this scenario are given in Table 7.2 . In the third column
of Table 7.2 (marked A) we show the number of events for galactic
supernova neutrinos with luminosities and average energies considered in
this section while the last column (marked B) gives the number of events
with complete flavor oscillations ( @xmath ). Of course since the @xmath
do not have any conversion here, the @xmath signal remains unaltered.
Also as the neutral current reactions are flavor blind, the total
neutral current signal remains unchanged. But whether the time response
curve of the neutral current signal remains unchanged in presence of
mixing, in addition to delay, is an interesting question.

If the neutrinos have mass as well as mixing, then the neutrinos are
produced in their flavor eigenstate, but they travel in their mass
eigenstate. The neutrino mass eigenstates will travel with different
speeds depending on their mass and will arrive at the detector at
different times. For the scenario that we are considering only @xmath
and @xmath will be delayed. Hence to take this delay in arrival time
into account, the eq.( 7.7 ) has to be rewritten in terms of the mass
eigenstates. It can be shown that expression for the neutral current
event rate in terms of the mass eigenstates is,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.8)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

where @xmath is the @xmath flux at the source. If the neutrinos are
produced at densities much higher than their resonance densities, all
the mixings in matter are highly suppressed, and the neutrinos are
produced almost entirely in their mass eigenstates. For the three
generation case that we are considering, @xmath , @xmath and @xmath .
For the antineutrinos on the other hand, at the point of production in
the supernova @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . Hence the above expression
for the neutral current event rate in the presence of delay and mixing
can be written as,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.9)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Note that the above expression does not depend on the neutrino
conversion probability as the neutral current interaction is flavor
blind.

In fig. 7.3 we have plotted the neutral current event rate for the
reaction ( @xmath , where @xmath stands for all the 6 neutrino species)
as a function of time for massless neutrinos along with the cases for
mass but no mixing (eq.( 7.7 )) and mass along with mixing (eq.( 7.9 )).
The figure looks similar for the other neutral current reactions as
well, apart from a constant normalization factor depending on the total
number of events for the process concerned. The curves corresponding to
the massive neutrinos have been given for @xmath eV. As expected, the
shape of the neutral current event rate changes due to the delay of
massive @xmath . Since the delay given by eq.( 7.6 ) depends
quadratically on the neutrino mass, the distortion is more for larger
masses [ 32 ] . But the noteworthy point is that the presence of mixing
further distorts the rate vs. time curve. The reason for this distortion
can be traced to the fact that the time delay @xmath . As the energy
spectrum of the neutrinos change due to flavor mixing, the resultant
delay is also modified and this in turn alters the neutral current event
rate as a function of time. In fact the flavor conversion in the
supernova results in de-energising the @xmath spectrum and hence the
delay given by eq.( 7.6 ) should increase. As larger delay caused by
larger mass results in further lowering of the neutral current event
rate vs. time curve for early times, one would normally expect that the
enhanced delay as a result of neutrino flavor conversion would have a
similar effect. But the fig. 7.3 shows that during the first second, the
curve corresponding to delay with mixing is higher than the one with
only time delay. This at first sight seems unexpected. But then one
realizes that while the flavor conversion reduces the average energy of
the massive @xmath increasing its delay and hence depleting its signal
at early times, it energizes the massless and hence undelayed @xmath
beam, which is detected with full strength. Therefore, while for no
mixing the @xmath gave the larger fraction of the signal, for the case
with mixing it is the @xmath that assume the more dominant role, and so
even though the @xmath arrive more delayed compared to the case without
mixing, the delay effect is diluted due to the enhancement of the @xmath
fraction and the depletion of the @xmath fraction of the neutral current
events. We have also checked that although it may seem that the curve
with delay and mixing can be simulated by another curve with delay alone
but with smaller mass, the actual shape of the two curves would still be
different. This difference in shape though may not be statistically
significant and hence one may not be able to see the effect of mixing in
the time delay of the neutrinos just by looking at the time response of
the neutral current event rate in the present water Cerenkov detectors.
We therefore look for various other variables which can be studied to
compliment this.

One such variable which carries information about both the neutrino mass
and their mixing is R(t), the ratio of charged to neutral current event
rate as a function of time. In fig. 7.4 we give the ratio R(t) of the
total charged current to the neutral current event rate in @xmath in SNO
as a function of time. Plotted are the ratios (i) without mass, (ii)
with only mixing, (iii) with delay but zero mixing and (iv) with delay
and flavor mixing. The differences in the behavior of R(t) for the four
different cases are clearly visible. For no mass R(t)=0.3 and since the
time dependence of both the charged current and neutral current reaction
rates are the same, their ratio is constant in time. As the presence of
mixing enhances the charged current signal keeping the neutral current
events unaltered, R(t) goes up to 0.61 for only mixing, remaining
constant in time, again due to the same reason. With the introduction of
delay the ratio becomes a function of time as the neutral current
reaction now has an extra time dependence coming from the mass. At early
times as the @xmath get delayed the neutral current event rate drops
increasing R(t). These delayed @xmath s arrive later and hence R(t)
falls at large times. This feature can be seen for both the curves with
and without mixing. The curve for only delay starts at R(t)=0.52 at t=0
s and falls to about R(t)=0.26 at t=10 s. For the delay with mixing case
the corresponding values of R(t) are 0.83 and 0.51 at t=0 and 10 s
respectively. The important point is that the curves with and without
mixing are clearly distinguishable and should allow one to differentiate
between the two cases of only delay and delay with neutrino flavor
conversion.

In order to substantiate our claim that the two scenarios of only delay
and delay with mixing are distinguishable in SNO, we divide the time
into bins of size 1 second. The number of events in each bin is then
used to estimate the @xmath statistical error in the ratio R(t) in each
bin and these are then plotted in fig. 7.4 for the typical time bin
numbers 1, 4 and 7. From the figure we see that the two cases of delay,
with and without mixing, are certainly statistically distinguishable in
SNO for the first 6 seconds.

We next focus our attention on @xmath , the neutral current @xmath -th
moments of the neutrino energy distributions [ 33 ] observed at the
detector, defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

while the corresponding normalized moments are given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

We have shown the behavior of the 1st normalized moment @xmath in fig.
7.5 as a function of time in SNO. For massless neutrinos, the @xmath has
a value 40.97, constant in time, as this is again a ratio and hence the
time dependence gets canceled out as in the case of R(t). For the case
where the @xmath is massive and hence delayed, it assumes a time
dependence. Since the delay @xmath and since the neutrinos are produced
at the source with an energy distribution, hence at each instant the
lower energy @xmath will be delayed more than the higher energy @xmath .
Therefore @xmath , which gives the energy centroid of the neutral
current event distribution in @xmath , starts from a low value 38.76 at
t=0 s as all the @xmath are delayed, rises sharply as the higher energy
neutrinos arrive first and then falls slowly as the lower energy delayed
@xmath start arriving. If the @xmath are allowed to mix with the @xmath
, then they are de-energized and the above mentioned effect is further
enhanced. To make an estimate of whether SNO would be able to
distinguish the three cases discussed above, we compute the @xmath
statistical errors in the @xmath normalized moment for the two scenarios
of delay, with and without mixing, and show them for the @xmath , @xmath
and @xmath bins. We see that the errors involved are large enough to
completely wash out the differences between the energy moments with and
without neutrino mass and mixing. Hence the normalized energy moments
fail to probe neutrino mass and mixing as at early times we don’t see
much difference between the different cases considered, while at late
times the number of events become very small so that the error in @xmath
becomes huge, increasing the error in @xmath .

The variable that can be a useful probe for differentiating the case for
delay with mixing from the case for delay without mixing is the ratio of
the unnormalized moment of the charged to neutral current events

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

We present in fig. 7.6 , for SNO, the @xmath vs. time plots (for n=1)
for the cases of (a) massless neutrinos (b) with mixing but no delay (c)
with delay but no mixing and (d) with delay as well as mixing. Since
this is a ratio, the supernova flux uncertainties get canceled out to a
large extent and since the unnormalized moments have smaller statistical
errors, this is a better variable than the normalized moments to observe
the signatures of neutrino mixing. In the figure we have shown the
@xmath statistical errors in @xmath for the two cases of delay alone and
delay with mixing, for the @xmath , @xmath and @xmath bins in time, and
the two cases are clearly distinguishable in SNO for early as well as
late times. Note that @xmath is different from the ratio R(t) as it
gives information about the ratio of the energy centroids of the charged
current and neutral current distributions as a function of time, while
the latter gives only the ratio of the number of events as a function of
time.

The advantage of using ratios is that, they are not only sensitive to
the mass and mixing parameters but are also almost insensitive to the
details of supernova models. Since they are a ratio they are almost
independent of the luminosity and depend only on some function of the
ratio of neutrino temperatures. All the calculations presented so far
are for fixed neutrino temperatures. In order to show that the time
dependence of the neutrino temperatures does not alter our conclusions
much, we present our analysis with time dependent neutrino temperatures.
We take

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

These forms for the neutrino temperatures follow from fits to the
results of the numerical supernova model given in Totani et al. [ 14 ]
which we had used in the previous section. In fig. 7.7 we compare the
ratio R(t) for the cases of delay and delay with mixing for the two
cases of fixed temperatures and the time dependent temperatures. It is
clear from the figure that that the time dependence of the neutrino
temperatures does not have much effect on the time dependence of the
ratio of the charged current to neutral current rates. In fact the two
curves corresponding to fixed and time dependent temperatures, fall
within @xmath statistical errorbars for both the cases of only delay and
delay with mixing.

### 7.3 Summary

In conclusion, we have shown that with the model of Totani et al. even
with vacuum oscillations we obtain appreciable enhancement in the
expected @xmath signal in SNO and SK even though the number of neutrinos
arriving at the detector from the supernova goes down. In contrast to
the case where we have MSW resonance in the supernova, with vacuum
oscillations we get enhancement for both @xmath as well as @xmath
events. If we have a galactic supernova event in the near future and if
we get a distortion in the neutrino spectrum and an enhancement in the
signal, for both @xmath as well as @xmath then that would indicate
vacuum neutrino oscillations.

We have shown that even though neutrino flavor mixing cannot alter the
total neutral current signal in the detector - the neutral current
interaction being flavor blind, it can have a non-trivial impact on the
delay of massive neutrinos, which alters the neutral current event rate
as a function of time. The neutral current event rate though does not
depend on the neutrino conversion probability. In order to study the
effect of neutrino mass and mixing we have suggested various variables.
Of the different variables that we have presented here, the ratio of the
charged to neutral current event rate R(t), can show the effect of
mixing during the first few seconds, while the charged to neutral
current ratio of the energy moments are useful diagnostic tools for all
times. These variables are not just sensitive to flavor mixing and time
delay, they are also insensitive to supernova model uncertainties and
hence are excellent tools to study the effect of flavor mixing on the
time delay of massive supernova neutrinos. Though we have considered a
mass spectrum for the neutrinos where only the @xmath have a measurable
delay but the model considered is one of many and one can easily extend
the above formalism to include more general classes of neutrino models.
