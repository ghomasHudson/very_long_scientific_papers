In this thesis we describe methods for avoiding the detrimental effects of
decoherence while at the same time still allowing for computation of the
quantum information. The philosophy of the method discussed in the first part
of this thesis is to use a symmetry of the decoherence mechanism to find robust
encodings of the quantum information. Stability, control, and methods for using
decoherence-free information in a quantum computer are presented with a
specific emphasis on decoherence due to a collective coupling between the
system and its environment. Universal quantum computation on such collective
decoherence decoherence-free encodings is demonstrated. Rigorous definitions of
control and the use of encoded universality in quantum computers are addressed.
Explicit gate constructions for encoded universality on ion trap and exchange
based quantum computers are given. In the second part of the thesis we examine
physical systems with error correcting properties. We examine systems that can
store quantum information in their ground state such that decoherence processes
are prohibited via energetics. We present the theory of supercoherent systems
whose ground states are quantum error detecting codes and describe a spin
ladder whose ground state has both the error detecting and correcting
properties. We conclude by discussing naturally fault-tolerant quantum
computation.
