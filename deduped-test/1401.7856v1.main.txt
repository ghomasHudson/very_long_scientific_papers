## Chapter 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Historical Overview

In 1935 Hideki Yukawa proposed a field that should be responsible for
the short-range force between the neutron and the proton, where the
quanta would be bosons (integer spin) with charge @xmath and mass about
200 times the mass of the electron [ 1 ] . Homi Bhabha introduced a
similar particle but uncharged to account for the interaction between
two protons [ 2 ] . This new particle, proposed as the mediator of the
field, was named meson , for having a mass intermediate between the
electron and the proton. It was discovered from cosmic rays in 1947, by
Cecil Powell in collaboration with Giuseppe Occhialini [ 3 ] . In the
same year, also with César Lattes, the same authors identified another
“meson”, the already discovered muon , which does not interact strongly,
and distinguished it from the former meson which was called pion [ 4 ] .
This was followed by the discovery of a panoply of strongly interacting
particles, both baryons, with mass above the proton mass and
half-integer spin (fermions), and mesons. The term “meson” was then
redefined to designate solely particles with intermediate mass which
interact strongly, thus excluding the @xmath .
In 1961 Murray Gell-Mann proposed “The Eightfold Way”, a scheme of
classification of baryons and mesons based on symmetries and on the
already discovered states, where the eight known baryons were grouped in
a supermultiplet, and the mesons in two octets of pseudoscalars and
vectors, plus two singlets [ 5 ] . A similar representation was
independently proposed by Yuval Ne’eman in the same year [ 6 ] .
Inquiring about the origin of the internal symmetries of isospin or
hypercharge, the mechanism of bootstrap was introduced, which states
that the internal symmetries can be expressed as equalities among
certain masses and couplings, whose values are not put in by hand but
emerge from self-consistency [ 7 ] . However, a different scheme was
proposed in 1964 by Gell-Mann, which postulates that the baryons and
mesons are composite systems of quarks @xmath and antiquarks @xmath ,
where baryons are combinations @xmath , etc., and mesons @xmath , etc.,
within @xmath flavor symmetry [ 8 ] . A similar picture was proposed
independently by George Zweig, which used the term aces instead of
quarks [ 9 ] . Evidence of a composite proton came out in 1969, in
experiments of deep inelastic scattering performed by E. Bloom et al.
and by M. Breidenbach et al. [ 10 ] . James Bjorken and Sidney Drell
contributed significantly to this discovery by proposing experimental
methods to study the proton pointlike constituents, the “partons”, after
Feynman, relating further partons to quarks [ 11 ] .
As mentioned above, there were two known internal symmetries of the
mesons and baryons, viz. isospin and the hypercharge , a sum over baryon
number and strangeness . A new internal symmetry was revealed after the
discovery of the meson @xmath in 1974 [ 12 ] , namely charm , which adds
to hypercharge.
Finally, a new quantum group associated with the strong interaction was
postulated in 1973 by David Gross and Frank Wilczek, the color gauge
group, in the context of non-Abelian field theories [ 13 ] .

### 1.2 The constituent quark model

The constituent quark model is based on all the discoveries mentioned
above, in particular the “eightfold way”, and some further developments.
It offers the most complete classification scheme of mesons and baryons.
Generically, we define hadrons as all particles and states that are
subject to the strong interaction. Within the quark model, a meson is a
hadron composed of a quark-antiquark pair @xmath , while the baryon is a
hadron composed of three quarks @xmath . No other hadrons were
contemplated in the original model. The name “constituent” is used,
because the postulated elementary quarks have never been observed in
isolation, which implies that their mass must be estimated from the
composite hadrons, as an effective, constituent mass. As far as we know,
from experiment and Standard Model predictions, there are six different
quark flavors , namely @xmath and @xmath , associated with isospin
symmetry, @xmath associated with the strangeness quantum number, @xmath
, @xmath and @xmath .
The symmetries considered in the quark model are the flavor group @xmath
, or @xmath , the spin group @xmath , electric charge, parity, @xmath
-parity and @xmath -parity. The flavor group is not an exact symmetry
due to differences among the masses of the quarks. Yet @xmath , with
@xmath , is a reasonably good symmetry, whereas @xmath , with @xmath ,
is badly broken due to the considerably larger charm mass. Quarks are
fermions with spin @xmath and SU(2) is an exact symmetry. Baryons may
have spin @xmath while mesons have @xmath . Henceforth only mesons will
be described, as they are the subject of this thesis. Parity is defined
as @xmath , where @xmath is the orbital angular momentum and the
additional factor @xmath is due to the intrinsic parity of the
fermion-antifermion pair @xmath . Charge-conjugation or @xmath -parity
is an operator given by @xmath , being applicable only to particles
which are their own antiparticles. Also, the @xmath -parity operator is
defined by @xmath , where @xmath is the isospin. Parity, @xmath -parity,
@xmath -parity and @xmath are conserved under strong interactions. In
Table 1.1 the lowest angular excitations of the quark-model mesons are
summarized.

The flavor multiplets are constructed as follows:

    @xmath

     Isovectors: @xmath

     Isodoublets: @xmath , @xmath

     Isoscalars: @xmath , @xmath

Here, all states within the nonet are orthogonal. In addition,

    @xmath

     Open charm: @xmath

     Unflavored: @xmath , @xmath

However, the @xmath component decouples from the @xmath and @xmath
states and in practice the unflavored states of the broken group will be
@xmath , @xmath , and @xmath , i.e., charmonium . Within @xmath there is
some mixing between the strangeonium @xmath and the @xmath components.
Table 1.2 lists the light-quark nonets, as well as the heavy-quark
mesons with charm, for pseudoscalars and vectors. The octet and singlet
states are mixtures of physical states which can be written as:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath . The mixing angle, which is determined empirically, is
only relevant for the pseudoscalars @xmath . Finally, the @xmath states
within the quark model are the whole set of angular plus radial
excitations, the latter associated with the quantum number @xmath .

### 1.3 Quantum Chromodynamics

Although the constituent quark “model”, as outlined above, is a good
starting point for spectroscopy work, it does not yet include any
dynamics and so cannot explain all hadronic states nor resonance
phenomena. Even within its quality of a classification scheme, it is a
simplification of reality. In a physical quantum system, there are
continuous creation and annihilation phenomena, which can be described
through the method of second quantization. Therefore, a mesonic system
should be a composition of a “permanent” @xmath component, the valence
quarks, and a fluctuation component composed of @xmath pairs that are
continuously being created and annihilated, the sea quarks. This is
still a simplified scheme.
Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is a gauge-field theory developed upon the
concept of color and based on the successful theory of quantum
electrodynamics, which can be treated perturbatively [ 13 , 14 ] . QCD
introduces a new fundamental degree of freedom, which is the mediator of
the strong interaction, called gluon , a massless particle of spin 1,
electrically neutral, but color charged and with the property of being
self-interacting. The theory only allows colorless compositions of
quarks in the final states, like the common mesons and baryons, but
additionally @xmath or @xmath tetraquarks, @xmath pentaquarks, etc., and
also combinations between quarks and gluons as well, the hybrids , and
compositions of gluons only, the glueballs . All these configurations
are labeled exotics . The theory also predicts another internal degree
of freedom without external “legs”, the ghost fields, to account for
gauge invariance.
Empirical observations of the strong interaction reveal two fundamental
properties of the force, namely confinement and asymptotic freedom ,
both related to the spatial or, equivalently, momentum scale of the
interaction. That is, quarks and gluons are always bound in colorless
singlets at the femtometer scale, and behave as quasi-free below 1 fm, a
region which can be probed at high momentum transfer. This is explained
within QCD via the properties of the renormalized coupling strength of
the interaction, which grows with the separation distance between the
elementary quarks and gluons.
Although QCD might be an attractive theory for its conceptual
simplicity, due to the highly nonperturbative character of the strong
interaction this simplicity is deceiving. In practice the perturbation
expansion can be performed only at very high energies, outside the
physical regime of interest here, where confinement dominates and
resonance phemonena are observed. Anyhow, the machinery of calculus is
always very extensive, involving many details and techniques.
In what concerns the subject of hadron spectroscopy, QCD may contribute
in two ways. The most direct approach is via lattice QCD , i.e., the
heavy computational calculus of the full nonperturbative theory on a
finite and discrete lattice. The indirect contribution is via models
that are QCD inspired.
Finally, there is an empirical rule applicable to mesons, related to the
dynamics of the interaction, viz. the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) rule [ 9
, 15 ] , which states that meson decay channels which require the
creation of a new @xmath pair besides the original pair, by breaking the
latter’s string , are strongly favored - OZI- allowed , whereas the
decay channels that involve a pair creation from the vacuum without
breaking the string of the original pair are highly suppressed - OZI-
suppressed . In the latter type, intermediate gluons must carry energy
enough to transform into a @xmath pair.

### 1.4 @xmath-matrix theory

There is another way to approach a physical problem without going into
all details of a microscopic description, which is by reducing the
parameters of the system to only a few, and then to calculate the
dynamics fully. From a conceptual point of view it may be harder to
understand, but the touchstone conferring reliability to these
approaches is the comparison with experimental data. This is the spirit
in which the Scattering matrix - @xmath -matrix - theory of strong
interactions was built and developed. One of the reasons why field
theories are often preferred is the claim of being built upon first
principles. Henry Stapp discussed [ 16 ] the physical relevance of such
principles on one side, and the possibility of constructing an @xmath
-matrix theory over axioms on the other side. In what concerns field
theories, he pointed out: (i) it is not known whether the principles
admit any rigorous solutions, except for trivial ones; (ii) the
principles depart from hypothetical space-time points, which are not
observables; (iii) the specific principles of positive definiteness,
nondegeneracy of the vacuum, completeness, locality, and energy spectrum
are restrictive and arbitrary. In addition, he understood there is a
disconnection between field theory and practical calculations, adding:

  “Practical calculations are the heart of physics, and it is the job of
  physical axioms to specify a connection between experience and a
  well-defined mathematical scheme in which practical calculations have
  place.”

Then, he proposed seven postulates for @xmath -matrix theory:

1.   There is a linear relation between the probabilities and the
    squares of amplitudes, according to basic quantum theory. This
    postulate leads to unitarity.

2.   Certain sets of experiments are complete, e.g., the measurement of
    momentum, spin and particle type of all particles present are a
    complete set. Interference effects are observable.

3.   The connection of momentum functions to space-time coordinates is
    given by a Fourier transformation.

4.   Relativistic invariance.

5.   The physical interpretation of the quantities of the theory be such
    that translational and rotational invariance imply conservation of
    energy-momentum and angular momentum.

6.   From the above postulates one can construct a set of scattering
    functions which satisfy unitarity, and are analytic in the interior
    and on the boundary of their physical sheet, except for
    singularities required by unitarity, due to phase space.

7.   All physical-type points of the physical sheet correspond to
    processes actually occurring in nature.

Geoffrey Chew added [ 17 , a.] to these postulates three assumptions:
(i) maximal smoothness, i.e., maximal analyticity; (ii) maximal
strength, i.e., saturation of the unitary condition; and (iii) isospin,
strangeness, baryon number, etc., conservation.
In a different paper [ 17 , b.] , Chew and Steven Frautschi stressed the
importance of the definition of “pure potential scattering” instead of
scattering of “independent” particles , and they stated, after observing
several experimental tests:

  “It is plausible that none of the strongly interacting particles are
  completely independent but that each is a dynamical consequence of
  interactions between others.”

The theory of the scattering matrix was constructed on the basis of the
principles of quantum mechanics and the pioneering work of John Wheeler
[ 18 ] . He proposed the “method of resonating group structure” to
nuclear physics, which he contrasted with the Hartree-Fock procedure,
i.e., the method of building up a wave function for a whole problem out
of partial wave functions that describe the close interactions within
the individual groups, instead of directly building up a wave function
for a system of many particles. He obtained the scattering matrix as a
unitary relation which “connects the asymptotic behavior of an arbitrary
particular solution with that of solutions possessing a standard
asymptotic form” , cf. Eq. (48), which corresponds to @xmath , where
@xmath is the phase shift.
Another important precursor work [ 19 ] was due to Tullio Regge, who
extended the analyticity of the radial Schrödinger equation to complex
orbital momenta, relating potentials with scattering amplitudes, and
further deriving pole positions from the transmitted momentum. These
Regge poles were associated with bound states and resonances that can be
viewed in the complex energy @xmath plane for fixed angular momentum
@xmath or vice versa. The trajectory of a single pole in the @xmath
plane as @xmath changes would corresponds to a family of “particles” of
different mass, thus defining a Regge trajectory [ 17 , c.] .
Some classical reading about @xmath -matrix theory may be found in Ref.
[ 20 ] .

### 1.5 Phenomenological Models

Bound states calculated within the quark model essentially describe the
valence-quark contribution, i.e., the quenched spectrum.
Phenomenological models which treat the resonant spectrum of bare states
without considering any other relevant hadron degrees of freedom are
thus considered quenched approaches. This is the case of, e.g., the
mainstream model of Stephan Godgrey and Nathan Isgur (GI), a QCD
inspired model [ 21 ] , where the meson spectrum is built up over a
Coulomb-plus-linear “funnel” potential. Here, the authors distinguish
between “soft” QCD - quenched, and “true QCD” - unquenched , which
includes the whole QCD action. In the same spirit, also the exotic
states should have a “quenched” spectrum which, in combination with the
regular @xmath mesons, or @xmath baryons, would give rise to the complex
structures observed in the experiments.
Instead, unquenched descriptions state that, besides the important
valence-quark contribution, a meson or baryon is dressed with other
relevant hadron components which must be included in an appropriate
description of the experimental data. This “dressing” comes from the
strongly coupled nonlinear character of the interaction. In Ref. [ 22 ]
the authors suggested two opposite unquenching methods, by either
dressing quark-model states and comparing the outcome to the
experiments, or by taking into account self-energy contributions,
implicitly included in the measured scattering-matrix poles, through an
“undressing” procedure and comparing the outcome to the quark model.
This undressing may be performed through a coupled-channel model
involving hadronic mass shifts, related to off-shell effects.
Nonperturbative microscopical approaches are employed to study the
confinement problem. Within QCD, quarks and gluons interact via
effective strings with a potential that grows linearly with the
separation distance between two color particles, at the scale @xmath GeV
@xmath , where @xmath is the QCD scale parameter, and the slope of the
potential is given by the string tension, @xmath .
Another important nonperturbative phenomenon is the spontaneous breaking
of chiral symmetry, which leads to the appearance of pseudoscalar
Goldstone bosons, a role played by the pion. This symmetry corresponds
to the @xmath symmetry group, with @xmath for left- and right-handed
quark fields, respectively, and @xmath the number of flavors of light
quarks. A textbook concerning nonperturbative methods in gauge theories
can be found in Ref. [ 23 ] . Effective approaches to spontaneous
chiral-symmetry breaking are given by the nonrenormalizable
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model [ 24 ] and the linear sigma model [ 25 ] . A
nonperturbative version of the latter model, at the quark instead of
nuclear level, was constructed by Delbourgo and Scadron, both for @xmath
and @xmath [ 26 ] , leading to accurate predictions of a host of
low-energy observables. Another approach to dynamical chiral-symmetry
breaking is by employing a current quark model with a chirally symmetric
confining potential [ 27 ] . Related with chiral symmetry is the concept
of Adler zeros , i.e., zero-mass pions which are emitted or absorbed in
a strong interaction or first-order electromagnetic process [ 28 ] .
A distinction is usually made among quark-mass assignments. The
constituent quark masses, used in hadron spectroscopy, the dynamical
quark masses, generated through chiral noninvariance of the QCD vacuum,
and current quark masses, which correspond to the bare quarks and are
associated with current divergences and higher momentum transfers [ 29 ]
.
In constituent quark models the meson spectrum is generally obtained by
solving the Schrödinger equation using some effective potential, which
includes a @xmath confining part and also spin-dependent components,
such as spin-orbit and color hyperfine interactions. The free parameters
are then tuned to give agreement with experiment [ 30 ] . Some models
include relativistic effects [ 21 ] that should be comparable to the
orbital splittings in the light-quark systems. The standard confining
potential is the already mentioned “funnel” potential given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the running coupling constant of the strong interactions
and @xmath is an integration constant. The Coulomb part is dominant for
smaller radii, typically for heavy systems, while the linear component
dominates at larger radii, characteristic of light-quark systems. Linear
Regge trajectories are usually seen as a consequence of the linear part
of the potential.
Meson decays involve creation of @xmath pairs. In some models a pair is
formed through intermediate gluons in a @xmath state, with @xmath . The
most common assumption is pair creation with vacuum quantum numbers,
i.e., in a @xmath state, with @xmath . This can be formulated in terms
of a harmonic-oscillator spatial @xmath basis [ 31 ] . Comparison with
experimental decays highly favors the @xmath model [ 32 ] . It is
possible that the mechanism of @xmath pair creation is strongly related
to the OZI rule [ 33 ] .

### 1.6 Experimental Data

Scattering-matrix poles may be studied via partial-wave analyses,
typically by measuring experimental phase shifts, amplitudes, and cross
sections. These quantities are always unquenched, by definition. A
typical resonant cross section is usually described by a simple
Breit-Wigner (BW) formula, original Ref. [ 34 ] , for a process @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , @xmath are the spins of the incoming particles, @xmath is
the spin of the resonance, @xmath is the c.m. momentum, and the BW
scattering amplitude @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the branching fraction of a given decay channel, @xmath
is the c.m. energy, @xmath is the resonance mass, and @xmath its total
decay width. These kinds of bell-shaped structures usually define the
mass and width of a resonance. However, resonance peaks may be very
broad and the line shapes very deformed, in which cases the definition
of both parameters is not clear at all. Figure 1.1 , Ref. [ 35 ] ,
illustrates one of these “deformed” signals viz., at the @xmath
resonance.

Although the BW mass is assumed by some to be the proper physical
property, the real part of the corresponding pole position in the
complex energy plane may be also a good definition of resonance mass.
These two definitions of mass are only equivalent for very narrow
resonances. In a recent work [ 36 ] a modified BW formula, with a new
phase parameter, adjusts to different resonance shapes in a
model-independent way.
Thresholds play a key role in understanding resonances. Some mesons
appear very close to a specific decay channel, such as the @xmath ,
which we will discuss further on, but also the scalars @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath , and the tensor @xmath . This kind of resonances often display a
cusp like line shape. However, not all cusps are necessarily generated
by resonant states, but may instead be produced by some inelastic
mechanism, as has been discussed by David Bugg [ 37 ] .
Other enhancements with resonant shapes observed in the decay channels
may not correspond to true resonances, as suggested in [ 38 ] for the
case of the @xmath . Furthermore, a resonant state may produce a dip
instead of a bump, due to the opening of competing decay channels.
Resonant phenomena associated with hadrons are not trivial to resolve
from the experimental point of view. Signal distortions may be due to
the superposition of partial waves, or inelasticities due to competing
decay channels and nearby thresholds. Also contributing to the
complexity of data analysis are the large widths of some resonances, and
the opening of many decay channels, which diminishes the branching
fraction of each channel, especially in the case of radial excitations.
A careful look at the listings of the Particle Data Group [ 39 ] allows
us to understand that many states predicted by the quark model are
missing. In particular, the first and second radial excitations are not
well established for all angular excitations in any flavor sector.
Experimental research in the low-energy resonance region is far from
being complete, for besides the need of a deeper understanding of the
enhancements, which often requires more statistics, many more states are
predicted than those that are observed. Moreover, the real existence of
exotic hadrons is still not unequivocal. Phenomenological models, while
trying to explain resonances and nonresonant structures from a
theoretical point of view, depend entirely on the experimental data to
be tested. In conclusion, more efforts are needed, especially
experimental ones, in this very topical issue of hadron spectroscopy.
For further reading, see Ref. [ 40 ] .

## Chapter 2 The Models

In this thesis two coupled-channel models are employed to study three
types of mesonic resonances: the strangeonium vector @xmath , the
pseudovectors @xmath axial-vectors @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath ,
and the charmonium-type axial-vector @xmath . All resonances are studied
within the Resonance-Spectrum-Expansion (RSE) model. The @xmath , alias
@xmath , is additionally studied in a simple two-channel model where the
wave function is fully determined. Both models are unquenched, are based
on the simplified constituent quark model presented in Sec. 1.2 , and
rely on the spirit of @xmath -matrix theory discussed in Sec. 1.4 .

### 2.1 Some scattering formalism

At instant @xmath a freely moving wave packet, at distance @xmath from a
target with radius @xmath , where @xmath , is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

This plane wave may be replaced by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the retarded wave function @xmath is a solution of the stationary
Schrödinger equation ( 2.3 ) and an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian
with a short-range central potential

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

The Green’s function @xmath is a propagator function defined as a
solution of the differential equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

One particular solution is the retarded Green’s function

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

The Lippman-Schwinger (LS) equation is then written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

This integral equation, which includes the boundary conditions, is a
formal solution of ( 2.3 ).
Substituting ( 2.5 ) in ( 2.6 ), the asymptotic expression for @xmath
becomes

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

With the help of the Møller operator

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

the definition @xmath , and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is an arbitrary complex variable, we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

The transition operator is defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

so that

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.13)
  -- -- -- --------

In case of spherical symmetry let us assume

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.14)
  -- -- -- --------

where @xmath are Legendre polynomials. Using @xmath , Eq. ( 2.14 ), and
also a plane-wave expansion in spherical harmonics, the integration of
Eq. ( 2.8 ) yields

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

The scattering operator is defined by

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.16)
  -- -- -- --------

It can be proved that its relation to @xmath is given by

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.17)
  -- -- -- --------

which equation explicitly shows that the matrix elements of @xmath are
on-shell while those of @xmath may be off-shell .
As an example, consider the spherically symmetric potential

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

which in momentum space reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a spherical Bessel function. If we define

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

Eq. ( 2.19 ) reduces to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

Finally, using Eq. ( 2.12 ) we get

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.22)
  -- -- -- --------

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.23)
  -- -- -- --------

The first term of the Born expansion of Eq. ( 2.22 ) gives

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

the second order term

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the whole @xmath operator becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

### 2.2 The Resonance-Spectrum-Expansion (RSE) model

The RSE coupled-channel model describes elastic scattering of the form
@xmath , where @xmath , and @xmath may be in principle any hadrons. In
all applications here, they are non-exotic mesons @xmath . The
transition operator, Eq. ( 2.22 ), is described by a matrix, where each
row or column represents a different channel. Its Born expansion may be
represented by the diagrams in Fig. 2.1 .

The effective meson-meson potential consists of an intermediate-state
@xmath -channel @xmath propagator between two @xmath -meson-meson vertex
functions for the initial and final state, reading [ 41 ]

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.27)
  -- -- -- --------

with

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the RSE propagator contains an infinite tower of @xmath -channel
bare @xmath states, corresponding to the spectrum of an, in principle,
arbitrary confining potential. Here, @xmath is the discrete energy of
the @xmath -th recurrency in the bare @xmath channel with orbital
angular momentum @xmath and spin @xmath , and @xmath is the
corresponding coupling to the @xmath -th meson-meson channel.
Furthermore, in Eq. ( 2.27 ), @xmath is an overall coupling, and @xmath
and @xmath are the @xmath -th order spherical Bessel function and the
(relativistically defined) off-shell relative momentum in meson-meson
channel @xmath , respectively. The spherical Bessel function originates
in our string-breaking picture of OZI-allowed decay, being just the
Fourier transform of a spherical delta function of radius @xmath ; see
Eqs. ( 2.19 ) and ( 2.20 ). Together with the overall coupling constant
@xmath , the radius @xmath is a freely adjustable parameter here, though
its range of allowed values turns out to be quite limited in practice.
Because of the separable form of the effective meson-meson interaction
in Eq. ( 2.27 ), the fully off-shell @xmath -matrix can be solved in
closed form with straightforward algebra, resulting in the expression

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

with

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the spherical Hankel function of the first kind, @xmath
and @xmath are the on-shell relative momentum and reduced mass in
meson-meson channel @xmath , respectively, and the matrix @xmath is
given by Eq. ( 2.28 ).
Although in principle any confinement potential can be employed for the
spectrum of the @xmath states, in practical applications of RSE, a
harmonic oscillator (HO) with constant frequency has been used, with
excellent results. For more details and further references, see Refs. [
41 ] - [ 46 ] . Therefore, it is used in all cases here as well. The HO
spectrum is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

where a constant frequency of @xmath is used, a value fixed long ago [
47 ] . Both @xmath and the constituent quark masses, ibid., are defined
in Eq. ( 2.32 ), where @xmath .

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

##### Relative Couplings

The relative couplings @xmath in Eq. ( 2.28 ) are computed in accordance
with the @xmath model for quark-pair creation and the OZI rule, using
the formalism of Ref. [ 48 ] , based on overlaps of HO wave functions.
These values were computed by Eef van Beveren in the @xmath flavor basis
and angular momentum basis, with three-meson vertices, and are listed in
Ref. [ 49 ] for several cases. As the @xmath -dependence may be written
as @xmath , where @xmath is a polynomial with degree below 4 for the
lowest angular excitations, in practice convergence of the series is
achieved by truncating it after 20 terms.

#### 2.2.1 Redefining the @xmath-matrix

It is straightforward to show that the @xmath -matrix @xmath (cf. Eq. (
2.17 )), where @xmath is the on-energy-shell restriction of the
multichannel @xmath -matrix in Eqs. ( 2.28 )–( 2.30 ), is unitary and
symmetric, when limited to open channels and real energies. However, it
is also easy to see that, for complex masses and so complex relative
momenta, the unitarity of @xmath is lost, though not its symmetry. The
latter property can be used to redefine the physical @xmath -matrix.
Since @xmath is always a symmetrix matrix, it can be decomposed, via
Takagi [ 50 ] factorization, as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is unitary and @xmath is a real nonnegative diagonal
matrix. Then we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have defined @xmath , also unitary. So the diagonal elements of
@xmath are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the positive Hermitian
matrix @xmath , which are all real and nonnegative. Moreover, since
@xmath is manifestly nonsingular, the eigenvalues of @xmath are even all
nonzero and @xmath is unique. Thus, we may define

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then, using Eq. ( 2.33 ) and @xmath , we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is obviously symmetric and, as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

also unitary. So @xmath has the required properties to be defined as the
@xmath -matrix for a scattering process with complex masses in the
asymptotic states.

### 2.3 Two-coupled-channel Schrödinger model

The RSE approach does not allow to obtain wave functions in a
straightforward fashion. Here, we resort to the equivalent [ 42 ]
coordinate-space coupled-channel formalism of Ref. [ 51 ] , which was
used to study the influence of strong decay channels on hadronic spectra
and wave functions, besides several more specific phenomenological
applications.
Consider now a system composed of a confined @xmath channel coupled to a
meson-meson channel @xmath . Confinement is still described by Eq. (
2.31 ). In the scattering channel, no direct interactions between the
two mesons are considered, with @xmath and @xmath being the reduced
two-meson mass and orbital angular momenta in the free channel,
respectively. Transitions between the two channels are modeled via an
off-diagonal delta-shell potential with strength @xmath , which mimics
string breaking at a well-defined distance @xmath . The corresponding
Hamiltonian, transition potential, and @xmath matrix Schrödinger
equation are given in Eqs. ( 2.38 )–( 2.41 ), with the usual definition
@xmath , where @xmath is the radial wave function.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

Once the @xmath @xmath matrix (cf. Eq. ( 2.55 )) has been constructed
from the wave function, possible bound or virtual states as well as
resonances can be searched for.

#### 2.3.1 Solving the coupled-channel Schrödinger equation

We twice integrate the Schrödinger equation ( 2.41 ) in order to get two
sets of boundary conditions, viz. Eqs. ( 2.42 ) and ( 2.43 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

A general solution to this problem is the two-component wave function
given by Eqs. ( 2.44 ) and ( 2.45 ), for the confined and meson-meson
channel, respectively:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.45)
  -- -- -- --------

In Eq. ( 2.44 ), the function @xmath vanishes at the origin, whereas
@xmath falls off exponentially for @xmath , their explicit expressions
being

  -- -------- -------- -- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath         (2.46)
     @xmath   @xmath         (2.47)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are the confluent hypergeometric functions of
first and second kind (see Sec. 2.4 ), respectively, @xmath is the
complex gamma function, @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

and @xmath . Note that only in the case of integer @xmath , i.e., for
@xmath , do @xmath and @xmath reduce to the usual Laguerre polynomials
for the three-dimensional HO potential. Furthermore, the functions
@xmath and @xmath in Eq. ( 2.45 ) are simple redefinitions of the
standard spherical Bessel and Neumann functions, i.e., @xmath and @xmath
. From the boundary conditions ( 2.42 ) and ( 2.43 ), as well as the
wave-function expressions ( 2.44 ) and ( 2.45 ), we get, with the
definition @xmath ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
                                   (2.49)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Using now the Wronskian relations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
                 (2.50)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- --------

and continuity of the wave function at @xmath (cf. Eq. ( 2.43 )), we can
solve for three of the four unknowns @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and
@xmath . Note that Eqs. ( 2.42 ) and ( 2.43 ) are not entirely linearly
independent, so that solving all four constants is not possible. This is
logical, as the overall wave-function normalization does not follow from
the Schrödinger equation. Expressing all in terms of @xmath then yields

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

Note that, in order to obtain the @xmath wave function in the outer
region, we must substitute @xmath in Eq. ( 2.45 ) (also see below).
Finally, the normalization constant @xmath of the total wave function is
determined by computing

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then, we can also calculate the root-mean-square radius @xmath of the
two-component system by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

As for the @xmath -matrix poles corresponding to resonances, bound
states, or virtual bound states, @xmath can be solved from continuity of
@xmath at @xmath in Eq. ( 2.45 ), resulting in the expression

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

with the @xmath @xmath -matrix simply given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

Real or complex poles can then be searched for numerically, by using
Newton’s method to find the energies for which @xmath , on the
appropriate Riemann sheet.

### 2.4 Special functions, numerical methods, and kinematics

The confluent hypergeometric functions @xmath and @xmath introduced in
Subs. 2.3.1 are defined in Ref. [ 52 ] , Eqs. (6.1.1) and (6.5.7),
respectively. Thus, the function @xmath is easily programmed as a
rapidly converging power series, while the definition (6.5.7) of @xmath
in terms of @xmath and the gamma function @xmath then also allows
straightforward computation, by employing Gauss’s multiplication formula
for @xmath (see Ref. [ 53 ] , Eq. (6.1.20)) so as to map the argument
@xmath to lying well inside the unit circle in the complex plane,
whereafter a very fast converging power-series expansion of @xmath (see
Ref. [ 53 ] , Eq. (6.1.34)) can be applied.
The integrals for wave-function normalization and computation of
r.m.s. radii are carried out by simple Gauss integration, choosing
increasing numbers of points on a finite interval for the @xmath
channel, and an infinite one for @xmath . Note that, in the former case,
the wave function falls off fast enough to allow convergence for a
finite cutoff, whereas in the latter a suitable logarithmic mapping is
used. In both cases though, because of the wave-function cusp at @xmath
and in order to avoid numerical instabilities, the domain of integration
is split into two pieces, with up to 16 Gauss points in the inner region
and 64 in the outer one, thus resulting in a very high precision of the
results.
Although the @xmath bound state can reasonably be considered a
nonrelativistic system, we still use relativistic kinematics in the
@xmath channel, since parts of the resonance-pole trajectories involve
relatively large (complex) momenta. For consistency, the same is done
for all energies. The manifest unitarity of the @xmath matrix is not
affected by this choice. Thus, the relative @xmath momentum reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are the threshold ( @xmath ) and pseudothreshold
( @xmath ) energies, respectively. The corresponding relativistic
reduced mass is defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

Note that in the @xmath channel the reduced mass is defined in the usual
way, i.e., @xmath , owing to the inherently nonrelativistic nature of
the HO potential and the ensuing wave function.

## Chapter 3 Strangeonium: @xmath’s and the @xmath

S. Coito, G. Rupp, and E. van Beveren, PRD 80 , 094011 (2009).
In 2006, the BABAR Collaboration announced [ 54 ] the discovery of a new
vector-meson resonance, called @xmath , in the initial-state-radiation
process @xmath , observed in the channel @xmath , with the @xmath meson
decaying to @xmath and the @xmath to @xmath or @xmath . Two years later,
the BES Collaboration confirmed [ 55 ] this resonance, then denoted
@xmath , in the decay @xmath . At present, the new state is included in
the PDG listings as the @xmath [ 39 ] with average mass @xmath MeV and
width @xmath MeV. However, these resonance parameters are strongly
challenged by the Belle [ 56 ] results on the @xmath , alias @xmath ,
observed in the process @xmath , yielding @xmath MeV and @xmath MeV. The
observation of this highly excited @xmath -type resonance with
(probably) modest width, besides the peculiar, seemingly preferential,
decay mode @xmath , triggered a variety of model explications, most of
which proposing exotic solutions. Let us mention first a
strangeonium-hybrid ( @xmath ) assignment, in the flux-tube as well as
the constituent-gluon model [ 57 ] , and a perturbative comparison of
@xmath decays in these exotic ansatzes with a standard @xmath @xmath
description from both the flux-tube and the @xmath model, by the same
authors [ 58 ] . Other approaches in terms of exotics, with QCD sum
rules, are an @xmath tetraquark assignment [ 59 ] , and an analysis [ 60
] exploring both @xmath and @xmath configurations. In an effective
description based on Resonance Chiral Perturbation Theory [ 61 ] , the
bulk of the experimental data is reproduced except for the @xmath peak.
This then led to a 3-body Faddeev calculation [ 62 ] , with the pair
interactions taken from the chiral unitary approach. Indeed, a resonance
with parameters reasonably close to those of the @xmath is thus
generated, though a little bit too narrow. Finally, a review on several
puzzling hadron states [ 63 ] mentions the possibility that the @xmath
arises from @xmath -wave threshold effects. In this chapter, we shall
study the possibility that the @xmath is a normal excited @xmath meson,
by coupling a complete confinement spectrum of @xmath states to a
variety of @xmath - and @xmath -wave two-meson channels, composed of
pairs of ground-state pseudoscalar (P), vector (V), scalar (S), and
axial-vector (A) mesons. The employed formalism is a multichannel
generalization of the Resonance-Spectrum Expansion (RSE), Sec. 2.2 ,
which allows for an arbitrary number of confined and scattering channels
[ 64 ] .

### 3.1 The RSE applied to @xmath recurrencies

In the present investigation of strangeonium vector mesons, both the
@xmath and @xmath @xmath confinement channels are included. We could in
principle also consider deviations from ideal mixing, by coupling the
corresponding two @xmath channels as well, but such fine corrections
will be left for possible future studies. For the meson-meson channels,
we consider the most relevant combinations of ground-state P, V, S, and
A mesons that have nonvanishing coupling to either of the two
confinement channels in accordance with the @xmath model and the OZI
rule. The resulting 17 channels are listed, with all their relevant
quantum numbers, in Table 3.1 . For the channels containing an @xmath or
@xmath meson, we assume a pseudoscalar mixing angle of @xmath , in the
flavor basis, though our results are not very sensitive to the precise
value. Also note that channels with the same particles but different
relative orbital angular momentum @xmath or total spin @xmath are
considered different. This is only strictly necessary for different
@xmath , because of the corresponding wave functions, but is also done
when @xmath is different, for the purpose of clarity. All relative
couplings are given in Table 3.1 for the lowest recurrencies ( @xmath ).
As a matter of fact, we list their squares, which are rational numbers,
but given as rounded floating-point numbers in the table, also for
clarity’s sake. For higher @xmath values, the couplings fall off very
rapidly. Their @xmath dependence, for the various sets of decay
channels, is presented in Table 3.2 . The threshold values in Table 3.1
are obtained by taking the meson masses given in the PDG 2008 tables or
listings [ 65 ] , with the exception of the @xmath (alias @xmath ), for
which we choose the real part of the pole position from Ref. [ 44 ] , as
it lies closer to the world average of @xmath masses. Note that we take
sharp thresholds, even when (broad) resonances are involved. We shall
come back to this point in Sec. 3.5 . Finally, we should notice that a
number of channels that also couple to @xmath vector states according to
the scheme of Ref. [ 48 ] , viz. @xmath -wave channels involving
axial-vector mesons as well as some channels with tensor mesons, have
not been included in the final calculations presented here. However,
their influence has been tested and turned out to be very modest, due to
the corresponding small couplings.
Now we evaluate the on-shell components of the @xmath -matrix defined in
Eqs. ( 2.28 ),( 2.29 ) for the channels given in Tables 3.1 – 3.3 .

### 3.2 Experimental status of @xmath states

Before adjusting our two free parameters @xmath and @xmath from Eq. (
2.29 ), let us first have a look at the experimental status of vector
@xmath resonances. According to the 2012 PDG listings [ 39 ] , there are
only 3 observed states, viz. the @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath . Their
PDG masses and widths are given in Table 3.4 .

Clearly, this is a very poor status, as several additional states must
exist in the energy range 1–2 GeV according to the quark model, and also
if we compare with e.g. observed @xmath resonances [ 65 ] in the same
energy interval. Moreover, the @xmath can hardly be the first radial
excitation of the @xmath , in view of the well established @xmath ,
which is almost 300 MeV lighter, and a typical mass difference of
100–150 MeV between the strange and nonstrange ( @xmath ) constituent
quarks [ 47 , 66 ] . This conclusion is further supported if indeed the
@xmath is confirmed as the first radial recurrence of the @xmath [ 67 ,
47 ] . So the @xmath is more likely to be the @xmath state, with a
hitherto undetected @xmath state somehwere in the mass range
1.5–1.6 GeV. As a matter of fact, in Ref. [ 68 ] a vector @xmath
resonance was reported at roughly 1.5 GeV, though this observation is,
surprisingly, included under the @xmath entry [ 65 ] . Even more oddly,
another @xmath -like state, at @xmath GeV and reported in the same paper
[ 68 ] , is also included under the @xmath [ 65 ] . However, a resonance
at about 1.9 GeV should be a good candidate for the next radial @xmath
recurrency, if we take the observed @xmath resonances in Ref. [ 67 ] for
granted.

### 3.3 Hunting after poles

In view of the poor status of excited @xmath states, let us adjust our
parameters @xmath and @xmath to the mass and width of the @xmath . Here,
we should mention that an additional phenomenological ingredient of our
model is an extra suppression of subthreshold contributions, using a
form factor, on top of the natural damping due to the spherical Bessel
and Hankel functions in Eq. ( 2.28 ). Such a procedure is common
practice in multichannel phase-shift analyses. Thus, for closed
meson-meson channels we make the substitution

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

The parameter @xmath is chosen at exactly the same value as in previous
work [ 44 , 46 ] , viz. @xmath GeV @xmath .
Choosing now @xmath and @xmath GeV @xmath , we manage to reproduce mass
and width of the @xmath with remarkable accuracy, namely @xmath MeV and
@xmath MeV. Note that these values of @xmath and @xmath are of the same
order of magnitude as in the work mentioned before [ 44 , 46 ] , which
dealt with scalar mesons.
In Table 3.5 we collect all resonance poles encountered on the
respective physical Riemann sheets, which correspond to @xmath for
closed channels and @xmath for open ones. When the latter conditions are
not fulfilled, we call the corresponding Riemann sheets unphysical.
Moreover, we also show here the pole positions obtained by taking only
the @xmath @xmath channel and switching off the @xmath , for fixed
@xmath and @xmath . Focusing for the moment on those poles that
originate

in the states of the confinement spectrum (indicated by “conf.” in the
table), we see good candidates for the resonances at @xmath GeV and
@xmath GeV reported in Ref. [ 68 ] , and possibly also for the @xmath ,
though our @xmath state seems somewhat too light. Note, however, that
under the @xmath entry [ 65 ] in the PDG listings there is a relatively
recent observation [ 69 ] with a mass of @xmath MeV, which is compatible
with our pole at 1602 MeV. Furthermore, the imaginary parts of the
confinement poles are generally too small, except for the @xmath . We
shall come back to this point in the conclusions below. Besides the
latter poles, also two so-called continuum poles are found, often
designated as dynamical poles, the most conspicuous of which is the one
at @xmath MeV, as the real part is very close to the mass of the @xmath
as measured by BABAR [ 54 ] and BES [ 55 ] . However, in view of the
much too large width, even as compared to the Belle [ 56 ] value,
considerable caution is urged. Also this point will be further discussed
in the conclusions.
Some words are in place here about our identification of the @xmath and
@xmath confinement poles in Table 3.5 . The point is that, rigorously
speaking, these designations only make sense for pure confinement states
and, moreover, without any @xmath / @xmath mixing. Now, in our approach,
the very mixing is provided by the coupling to common decay channels. So
for any nonvanishing value of the overall coupling @xmath there are no
longer pure @xmath and @xmath states, while for the physical value of
@xmath the mixing is probably considerable. Moreover, there is no
obvious way to tell which pole of a pair originating in a degenerate
confinement state stems from either @xmath or @xmath . Therefore, our
identification is partly based on the couplings in Table 3.1 , which on
the whole suggest larger shifts for @xmath than for @xmath , partly on a
comparison with a perturbative approach employed in Ref. [ 70 ] to find
poles for small @xmath .
The designation continuum pole becomes clear when plotting a
corresponding trajectory as a function of the overall coupling @xmath .
In Fig. 3.1 , the first such pole is shown to have an increasingly large
imaginary part for decreasing @xmath , eventually disappearing in the
continuum for @xmath .

Turning now to the @xmath energy region, we show in Fig. 3.6 the elastic
@xmath - and @xmath -wave

Note that the small jump at the important @xmath -wave @xmath threshold
is due to a minor threshold discontinuity of the damping function in
Eq. ( 3.1 ) for complex momenta. Figure 3.2 shows a similar trajectory,
but now for the lowest confinement pole, which ends up as the @xmath
resonance. Notice the large negative mass shift ( @xmath MeV), as well
as the way the pole approaches the @xmath threshold, which is typical
for @xmath -wave decay channels. Also note that the tiny jump in the
trajectory is due to the way relativistic reduced mass is defined below
threshold, which in the case of closed channels with highly unequal
masses ( @xmath here) requires an intervention to prevent the reduced
mass from becoming negative. In Fig. 3.3 , we depict the trajectories of
the @xmath and @xmath confinement poles. Note that the coupling to decay
channels lifts the original degeneracy of the @xmath and @xmath HO
states. The trajectories of the next pair of confinement poles, i.e.,
@xmath and @xmath , are drawn in Fig. 3.4 . Note the highly nonlinear
behavior of the poles, showing the unreliability of perturbative methods
to estimate coupled-channel effects.

### 3.4 Cross sections

Now we shall show, as mere illustrations, some of the cross sections
related to the resonance poles found in the preceding section.

In Fig. 3.8 , the elastic @xmath -wave @xmath cross section is depicted
in the energy region covering the @xmath as well as the @xmath and
@xmath resonances. We see that including the @xmath @xmath channel has
the effect of lowering the @xmath state, besides the generation of an
additional resonance, of course. This “repulsion” between the @xmath and
@xmath poles is also noticed for the @xmath and @xmath states.
Figure 3.5 shows the relative importance of the @xmath and @xmath
channels in the energy interval 1.5–1.7 GeV, which should be relevant
for the @xmath . The plotted quantity is the logarithm of the ratio of
the elastic @xmath and @xmath cross sections, which shows that the
@xmath channel is strongly dominant, except at low energies, because of
phase space, and close to the pole at @xmath GeV, where the two cross
sections are comparable. Dominance of the @xmath decay mode is reported
under the @xmath PDG entry [ 65 ] . @xmath cross sections. The effect of
the continuum pole at @xmath MeV is noticeable as a small and very broad
enhancement in the @xmath -wave cross section. In the @xmath -wave case,
its effect is completely overwhelmed by the huge cross section at
threshold, partly due to the @xmath pole not far below. Also quite
conspicuous are the here predicted @xmath and @xmath resonances (see
Table 3.5 for the respective pole positions). Of course, all these model
elastic cross sections have little direct bearing upon the
experimentally observed production cross sections. The production
process of the @xmath may be studied with the RSE production formalism [
71 ] , but that lies outside the scope of the present investigation,
which focused on the possibility of generating a @xmath resonance pole
through coupled channels.
Finally, in Fig. 3.7 we plot the logarithm of the ratios of the elastic
@xmath -wave @xmath cross section and the elastic @xmath , @xmath , and
@xmath cross sections, in the energy interval 2.0–2.3 GeV. We see that
the @xmath -wave @xmath cross section dominates up to about 2.08 GeV,
but getting overwhelmed first by the ( @xmath -wave) @xmath channel, and
then even more so by the @xmath -wave @xmath channel, right from its
threshold at @xmath GeV upwards. Also the @xmath channel is becoming
more important here. As for the @xmath channel, it gives rise to a final
state with two kaons and two pions, i.e., the same as that for which the
@xmath was observed. So the experimental status of the @xmath might be
improved if one succeeded in identifying and isolating the @xmath decay
mode, which should be quite important.

### 3.5 Summary and conclusions

In this chapter, we have applied the RSE formalism for non-exotic
multichannel meson-meson scattering to calculate the resonance spectrum
of excited vector @xmath mesons, and to find out whether this way the
@xmath can be generated. The inclusion of all relevant two-meson
channels that couple to the bare @xmath and @xmath @xmath states should
guarantee a reasonable description. Thus, several vector @xmath
resonances are predicted, some of which are good candidates for observed
states, while others may correspond to others, undetected so far, but
quite plausible in view of observed partner states in the excited @xmath
spectrum. Finally, a very broad @xmath -like resonance pole of a
dynamical origin is found, with real part very close to that of the
@xmath , but a much too large imaginary part, so that its interpretation
remains uncertain. On the other hand, the calculated resonances
originating in the confinement spectrum are generally too narrow.
These considerations bring us to the main problem of our description,
namely the inclusion of sharp thresholds only. The point is that many of
the channels in Table 3.1 involve highly unstable particles, several of
which are broad to very broad resonances themselves. Treating the
corresponding thresholds as sharp is clearly an approximation. In
particular, the @xmath meson included in the @xmath channels is a very
pronounced resonance in the coupled @xmath - @xmath system. This feature
is crucial in the three-body calculation of the @xmath in Ref. [ 62 ] ,
which indeed produces a clear resonance signal at almost the right
energy, and even with a somewhat too small width. We believe that in our
approach, too, a narrower @xmath might be generated, if we could account
for the physical width of the @xmath meson, and also for the widths of
the @xmath and @xmath resonances in the here included @xmath channel.
The reason is that the widths effectively cause these channels to act
already below their central thresholds, which will strongly influence
poles just underneath. Especially the width of very strongly coupling
@xmath channel, whose threshold lies only some 25 MeV below the real
part of the continuum pole at @xmath MeV, will surely have a very
significant effect on this pole’s trajectory. Because of the typical
behavior of continuum poles, with decreasing width for increasing
coupling, we expect that the width of our @xmath candidate may thus be
reduced. Conversely, including the widths of final-state resonances will
probably increase the widths of the now too narrow excited @xmath
resonances stemming from the confinement spectrum.
To account for the nonvanishing widths of mesons in the coupled channels
is a very difficult problem, since the simple substitution of the here
used real masses by the true complex masses will destroy the manifest
unitarity of the @xmath -matrix.

## Chapter 4 Axials with open-charm

S. Coito, G. Rupp, and E. van Beveren, PRD 84 , 094020 (2011).
The axial-vector (AV) charmed mesons @xmath and @xmath [ 39 ] have the
puzzling feature that their decay widths are much smaller than one would
expect on the basis of their principal @xmath -wave decay modes. Namely,
the @xmath decays to @xmath (possibly also in a @xmath wave), with a
phase space of more than 270 MeV, but has a total width of only 20–30
MeV [ 39 , 72 ] . On the other hand, the @xmath decays to @xmath in
@xmath and @xmath wave with a phase space of about 30 MeV, resulting in
an unknown tiny width @xmath MeV, limited by the experimental resolution
[ 39 ] . The discovery of the missing two AV charmed mesons, namely the
very narrow @xmath and the very broad @xmath , first observed by CLEO [
73 ] and Belle [ 74 ] , respectively, completed an even more confusing
picture. While the tiny width of the @xmath can be easily understood,
since this meson lies underneath its lowest Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka–allowed
(OZIA) and isospin-conserving decay threshold, the huge @xmath width, in
@xmath , is in sharp contrast with that of the @xmath . Moreover, the
@xmath lies 76 MeV below the @xmath , whereas the @xmath and @xmath are
almost degenerate in mass, if one takes the central value of the latter
resonance.
Quark potential models, with standard spin-orbit splittings, fail
dramatically in reproducing this pattern of masses. For instance, in the
relativized quark model [ 21 ] the @xmath state that is mainly @xmath
comes out at 2.57 GeV, assuming the already then well-established @xmath
to be mostly @xmath , though with a very large mixing between @xmath and
@xmath . Reference [ 21 ] similarly predicted a too high mass for the
dominantly @xmath state in the @xmath ( @xmath ) sector, viz. 2.49 GeV.
In the chiral quark model for heavy-light systems of Ref. [ 75 ] , the
result for the mainly @xmath @xmath state is also 2.49 GeV, while the
discrepancy is even worse in the @xmath sector, with a prediction of
2.605 GeV for the mostly @xmath state, now with a small mixing in both
sectors.
More recently and after the discovery of the @xmath (and @xmath ),
chiral Lagrangians for heavy-light systems (see e.g. Refs. [ 76 , 77 ,
78 , 79 ] ) have been employed in order to understand the masses of the
AV charmed mesons, in particular the mass splittings with respect to the
vector (V) mesons with charm @xmath and @xmath , respectively. Reference
[ 77 ] analyzed in detail the curious experimental [ 80 ] observation
that the AV-V mass difference is considerably larger in the
charm-nonstrange sector than in the charm-strange one, which is not
predicted by typical quark potential models [ 21 , 75 ] . The same
discrepancy applies to the scalar-pseudoscalar mass difference in either
sector [ 80 , 77 ] . In Ref. [ 77 ] , the problem was tackled by
calculating chiral loop corrections, but the result turned out to be
exactly the opposite of what is needed to remove or alleviate the
discrepancy.
An alternative approach to the AV charmed mesons is by trying to
generate them as dynamical resonances in chiral unitary theory [ 81 ] .
Indeed, in the latter paper, describing AV mesons in other flavor
sectors as well, several charmed resonances were predicted, including
the @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath , with reasonable results,
though the @xmath states came out about 100 MeV off. However, dynamical
generation of mesonic resonances, including the ones that are commonly
thought to be of a normal quark-antiquark type, may give rise to
interpretational difficulties, besides predicting several genuinely
exotic and so far unobserved states [ 81 ] . Dynamically generated AV
charmed as well as bottom mesons can be found in Ref. [ 82 ] , too.
Finally, in Ref. [ 83 ] a coupled-channel calculation of positive-parity
@xmath and @xmath was carried out in a chiral quark model, similar to
our approach in its philosophy, and with results for the @xmath and
@xmath close to the present ones.

### 4.1 OZI-allowed channels for AV charmed mesons

In order to account for the two possible spectroscopic channels @xmath
and @xmath contributing to a @xmath state with undefined @xmath -parity,
we couple both @xmath channels to the most important meson-meson
channels. Now we describe the physical AV charmed resonances by coupling
bare @xmath and @xmath @xmath , @xmath channels to all OZI-allowed
ground-state pseudoscalar-vector (PV) and vector-vector (VV) channels.
It is true that there are also relevant pseudoscalar-scalar (PS)
channels (in @xmath -wave), most notably @xmath and @xmath [ 80 ] in the
AV @xmath case, and @xmath for @xmath . These will contribute to the
observed [ 80 ] @xmath and @xmath decay modes, respectively. Although we
have developed, Subec. 2.2.1 an algebraic procedure to deal with
resonances in asymptotic states whilst preserving unitarity, the huge
widths of the @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath resonances may lead to fine
sensitivities that will tend to obscure the point we want to make, apart
from the fact that there will also be nonresonant contributions to the
@xmath and @xmath final states. So we restrict ourselves to the open and
closed PV and VV channels in the present investigation, but we shall
further discuss this issue below. The here included channels for @xmath
and @xmath are given in Tables 4.1 and 4.2 , respectively, together with
the corresponding orbital angular momenta, threshold energies, and
ground-state couplings squared @xmath , where @xmath refers to the
@xmath ( @xmath ) quark-antiquark component.

In Sec. 4.3 , we show in more detail how the ground-state coupling
constants in Tables 4.1 and 4.2 depend on the isospin and @xmath quantum
numbers of the various meson-meson channels. The latter squared
couplings must be multiplied by @xmath for @xmath and by @xmath for
@xmath , so as to obtain the couplings for the radial recurrences @xmath
in the RSE sum of Eq. ( 2.28 ). A subthreshold suppression of closed
channels is used just as in Eq. ( 3.1 ).
The energies of the bare AV @xmath and @xmath states we determine from
Eqs. ( 2.31 ) and ( 2.32 ). This yields masses of @xmath MeV and @xmath
MeV for the bare AV @xmath and @xmath states, respectively, which are
very close to values found in typical single-channel quark models [ 21 ,
75 ] .

### 4.2 Quasi-bound states in the continuum and other poles

Next we search for poles in the @xmath matrix. Starting with the @xmath
case, we choose @xmath in the range 3.2–3.5 GeV @xmath (0.64–0.70 fm),
which is in between the values of 2.0 GeV @xmath for an AV @xmath
system, Chapter 5 , and 4.0 GeV @xmath for vector @xmath states, Chapter
3 . In Fig. 4.1 , we plot several pole trajectories in the complex E
plane as a function of the overall coupling @xmath .

We see that this pole rapidly acquires a large imaginary part, whereas
the real part changes considerably less, especially in the range @xmath
– @xmath GeV @xmath , making it a good candidate for the broad @xmath
resonance. For @xmath and @xmath GeV @xmath , the pole comes out at
@xmath MeV, being thus fine-tuned to the experimental mass and width [
80 ] . However, there should be another pole in the @xmath matrix, since
there are 2 quark-antiquark channels and more than 2 MM channels. From
the structure of the @xmath -matrix in Eqs. ( 2.28 – 2.30 ), one can
algebraically show that the number of poles for each bare state is equal
to min @xmath , besides possible poles of a purely dynamical nature.
Indeed, another pole originating from the bare @xmath state is
encountered, with its trajectories depicted in Fig. 4.2 . Quite
remarkably, this pole moves very little, acquiring an imaginary part
that is a factor 55 smaller than in the  dd case, for the values @xmath
and @xmath GeV @xmath (see solid lines and bullets in both figures). So
this resonance, with a pole position of @xmath MeV, almost decouples
from the only open OZIA MM channel [ 84 ] , viz. @xmath , representing a
quasi-bound state in the continuum (QBSC) [ 82 ] . Moreover, it is a
good candidate for the @xmath , though its width of roughly 7 MeV is
somewhat too small and its mass 16 MeV too high. These minor
discrepancies may be due to the neglect of the PS channels, with broad
resonances in the final states, as suggested above.

Nevertheless, these encouraging results might be partly due to a
fortuitous choice of the parameters @xmath and @xmath . Therefore, we
now check the @xmath system, thereby scaling @xmath and @xmath with the
square root of the reduced quark mass (see Ref. [ 84 ] , Eq. (13)), so
as to respect flavor independence of our equations, which yields the
@xmath values @xmath GeV @xmath and @xmath . The ensuing @xmath pole
trajectories are depicted in Fig. 4.3 , but

now for @xmath GeV @xmath only. Thus, for @xmath , the strongly coupling
state comes out at 2452 MeV, i.e., only 7.5 MeV below the @xmath mass,
with a vanishing width, as the pole ends up below the lowest OZIA
channel. As for the @xmath QBSC, it indeed shifts very little from the
bare state, settling at @xmath MeV, i.e., only 5 MeV above the @xmath
mass, and having a width fully compatible with experiment [ 80 ] .
Besides the above ground-state AV charmed mesons, the present model of
course also predicts higher recurrences of these resonances. However,
due caution is necessary so as to account for the most relevant open and
closed decay channels at the relevant energy scales. Now, the first
radially excited HO levels of the @xmath / @xmath @xmath and @xmath
states lie at 2823 MeV and 2925 MeV, respectively, which allows the
corresponding resonances to be reasonably described by the channels
included in Tables 4.1 , 4.2 . Thus, we find again 4 poles, tabulated in
Table 4.3 , together with those of the ground-state

AV charmed mesons. For the radially excited states, we observe a similar
pattern as for the ground states, namely two poles that remain close to
the bare HO levels, whereas two other poles shift considerably. Note,
however, that the difference is not as dramatic as in the @xmath case.
This may be due to the fact that several decay channels are open now. As
for a possible observation of the here predicted @xmath states, no
experimental candidates have been reported so far. Namely, in the nearby
@xmath mass region, the two listed [ 80 ] resonances @xmath and @xmath [
80 ] both decay to @xmath and @xmath , which excludes an AV assignment.
Concerning the @xmath sector, the only listed [ 80 ] state around
2.8–2.9 GeV is the @xmath [ 85 ] , with natural parity and so not an AV,
decaying to @xmath and @xmath , which makes it a good candidate for the
@xmath state, possibly overlapped by the @xmath [ 86 ] . Note that the
lower of our two predicted @xmath resonances also practically coincides
with the @xmath , both in mass and width. This may be a further
indication that the @xmath structure corresponds to more than one
resonance only.
To conclude this section, we study — for the @xmath system — the
dependence of the lowest-lying poles on the number of included
quark-antiquark and MM channels. In Table 4.4 , besides the @xmath and
@xmath

poles resulting from the full calculation, with the 20 MM channels from
Table 4.1 , we first give the pole positions for the cases that only 2 (
@xmath , @xmath ) or 1 ( @xmath , @xmath ) MM channels are included. The
last two poles then correspond to calculations with the full 20 MM
channels but only one quark-antiquark channel, viz. @xmath or @xmath .
Notice that only one pole is found when the number of quark-antiquark or
MM channels is equal to 1. This confirms our above conjecture that the
number of poles for each bare HO level is given by min @xmath ).

### 4.3 Three-meson couplings

The ground-state couplings in Tables 4.1 and 4.2 are obtained by
multiplying the isospin recouplings given in Table 4.5 with the @xmath
couplings in Table 4.6 , for an OZIA process @xmath , Sec. 2.2 . For
clarity, we represent here all couplings by rational numbers. Note that
@xmath and @xmath in Table 4.5 stand for the pseudoscalar @xmath states
@xmath and @xmath , respectively. Then, we get the couplings to the
physical @xmath and @xmath mesons by applying a mixing angle — in the
flavor basis, see Eq. ( 1.1 ) — of @xmath , as in Ref. [ 46 ] . For the
@xmath and @xmath we assume ideal mixing.

### 4.4 Summary and conclusions

In the foregoing, we have managed to rather accurately reproduce the
masses and widths of the @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath with only
2 free parameters, one of which is already constrained by previous model
calculations, as well as by reasonable estimates for the size of these
mesons. Crucial is the approximate decoupling from the continuum of one
combination of @xmath and @xmath components, which amounts to a mixing
angle close to @xmath . Namely, if we express a QBSC as @xmath @xmath
@xmath @xmath @xmath , it decouples from the @xmath @xmath channel (for
@xmath ) or @xmath channel (for @xmath ), if @xmath (see Tables 4.1 ,
4.2 ). Inclusion of the other, practically all closed, channels
apparently changes the picture only slightly in our formalism. This
result is in full agreement with the findings in Ref. [ 83 ] . However,
in the present approach this particular mixing [ 87 ] comes out as a
completely dynamical result, and is not chosen by us beforehand.
Moreover, the bare-mass degeneracy of @xmath and @xmath states is
adequately lifted via the decay couplings in Tables 4.1 and 4.2 ,
dispensing with the usual @xmath splitting. Also note that the
occurrence of (approximate) bound states in the continuum for AV charmed
mesons had already been conjectured by two of us [ 84 ] , based on more
general arguments.
The puzzling discrepancy between the AV-V mass splittings in the @xmath
and @xmath sectors is resolved in our calculation by dynamical,
nonperturbative coupled-channel effects. A similar phenomenon we have
observed before [ 43 ] for the @xmath (2300–2400) [ 80 ] resonance, and
may be related to an effective Adler-type zero [ 40 , 88 ] in the @xmath
and @xmath channels in the AV and scalar @xmath cases, respectively,
owing to the small pion mass.
Summarizing, we have reproduced the whole pattern of masses and widths
of the AV charmed mesons dynamically, by coupling the most important
open and closed two-meson channels to bare @xmath and @xmath states
containing both @xmath and @xmath components. The dynamics of the
coupled-channel equations straightforwardly leads to one pair of
strongly shifted states and another pair of QBSCs. Ironically, the state
that shifts most in mass, namely the @xmath , ends up as the narrowest
resonance. This emphasizes the necessity [ 89 ] to deal with unquenched
meson spectroscopy in a fully nonperturbative framework.
One might argue that these conclusions will depend on the specific model
employed. Admittedly, our numerical results could change somewhat if
slightly different bare masses for the AV charmed mesons were chosen,
non- @xmath -wave decay channels were included as well, or a different
scheme was used to calculate the decreasing couplings of the higher
recurrences. Nevertheless, we are convinced the bulk of our results will
not change, most notably the appearance of QBSCs and the large shifts of
their partner states, as the almost inevitable consequence of exact
nonperturbative coupled-channel dynamics.

## Chapter 5 The charmonium @xmath

S. Coito, G. Rupp, and E. van Beveren, EPJC 71 , 1762 (2011).
The @xmath charmonium-like state was discovered in 2003 by the Belle
Collaboration [ 90 ] , as a @xmath enhancement in the decay @xmath . The
same structure was then observed, again in @xmath , by CDF II [ 91 ] ,
D0 [ 92 ] , and BABAR [ 93 ] . Moreover, CDF [ 94 ] showed that the
@xmath mass distribution favors decays via a @xmath resonance, implying
positive @xmath -parity for the @xmath . The @xmath has also been
observed in the @xmath and @xmath channels, by Belle [ 95 ] and BABAR [
96 ] , respectively. CDF [ 97 ] measured the @xmath mass with even
higher precision, viz. @xmath MeV, with a width fixed at @xmath MeV,
while BABAR [ 98 ] presented evidence for the long-awaited @xmath decay
mode (also see Ref. [ 99 ] ), and a surprising preference for the @xmath
assignment. At last, LHCb unequivocally determined the quantum numbers
@xmath , based on angular correlations in @xmath decays [ 100 ] . The
@xmath resonance is listed in the 2012 PDG tables [ 39 ] , with a mass
of @xmath MeV, a width @xmath MeV.
On the theoretical side, the first to foresee a narrow @xmath state
close to the @xmath threshold was Törnqvist [ 101 ] , arguing on the
basis of strongly attractive one-pion exchange for @xmath -wave
meson-meson systems, which he called deusons. For further molecular
descriptions and studies, see Ref. [ 102 ] , as well as the reviews by
Swanson [ 103 ] and Klempt & Zaitsev [ 104 ] . In Ref. [ 105 ] , a few
exotic model descriptions can be found, such as a hybrid or a
tetraquark; also see the reviews [ 103 , 104 ] . For further reading, we
recommend the very instructive analyses by Bugg [ 106 ] and Kalashnikova
& Nefediev [ 107 ] . Much more in the spirit of our own calculation is
the coupled-channel analysis by Danilkin and Simonov [ 108 ] , which
studies resonances and level shifts of conventional charmonium states
due to the most important open and closed decay channels. We shall come
back to their results below.
According to the PDG 2010 [ 80 ] , the @xmath could be either a @xmath
or a @xmath state, which implied @xmath or @xmath , as other radial
excitations would be much too far off (see e.g. Ref. [ 21 ] ). In the
present chapter, we study the @xmath scenario, despite the conclusion by
BABAR [ 98 ] , the last result by the time this study was performed,
from the @xmath mode, that @xmath was more likely. Indeed, the latter
assignment appeared to be at odds with radiative-transition data [ 109 ]
. For a further discussion of electromagnetic decays, see e.g. the
molecular description of Ref. [ 110 ] . But more importantly, in all
charmonium models we know of, the @xmath @xmath state lies well below
3.872 GeV, i.e., in the range 3.79–3.84 GeV (see e.g. Ref. [ 111 ] ).
Our own bare @xmath state comes out at 3.79 GeV, just as the
corresponding single-channel state in Ref. [ 108 ] . Now, the crucial
point is that loops from closed meson-meson channels are always
attractive [ 51 ] . Hence, since @xmath ¹ ¹ 1 Henceforth, we omit the
bar in @xmath , for notational simplicity. at 3.872–3.880 GeV is the
lowest OZIA channel that couples to a @xmath @xmath state, the
coupled-channel mass shift will inexorably be further downwards (also
see Ref. [ 111 ] ).
The present sections aims to show that the mass and width of the @xmath
, as well as the corresponding observed amplitudes in the @xmath ,
@xmath , and @xmath channels, are compatible with a description in terms
of a regular @xmath charmonium state, though mass-shifted and unitarized
via open and closed decay channels.

### 5.1 The RSE applied to charmonium @xmath

Sticking to the @xmath scenario, we employ again the RSE in order to
couple one @xmath channel, with @xmath , to several OZIA
pseudoscalar-vector (PV) and vector-vector (VV) channels, just as in our
preliminary study [ 112 ] of the @xmath . However, we now also couple
the OZI-suppressed (OZIS) @xmath and @xmath channels, to account for the
bulk of the observed @xmath and @xmath decays, respectively. Although
the former channel is isospin breaking as well, the extreme closeness of
its central threshold at 3872.4 MeV to the @xmath structure makes it
absolutely nonnegligible, despite a very small expected coupling. A
complication, though, is the large @xmath width, which does not allow
the @xmath channel to be described through a sharp threshold. Effects in
the @xmath from nonzero @xmath and @xmath widths were already estimated
in Ref. [ 113 ] . We tackle this problem by taking a complex mass for
the @xmath , from its pole position [ 114 ] , and then apply the novel,
empirical yet rigorous, unitarization procedure to the @xmath -matrix,
derived in Subsec. 2.2.1 . The analyticity and causality implications of
complex masses in asymptotic states were already studied a long time ago
[ 115 ] .
For consistency, we apply the same procedure to the @xmath meson,
despite the fact that its width is a factor 17.5 smaller than that of
the @xmath . Nevertheless, the @xmath width of about 8.5 MeV is very
close to the energy difference between the @xmath and @xmath thresholds,
and therefore not negligible. Finally, we shall neglect the unknown
small ( @xmath MeV [ 80 ] ) @xmath width [ 107 ] , because of the
relatively large error bars on the @xmath data, though this width may
have some influence on the precise @xmath pole position. Nevertheless,
reasonable estimates of the @xmath width yield values clearly smaller
than 100 keV [ 116 ] , so that its effect should be largely negligible
as compared to that of the @xmath and @xmath widths.
Let us now proceed with our RSE calculation of a bare @xmath (with
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ) @xmath state, coupled to a number of
MM channels. The resulting closed-form @xmath -matrix is given, onec
mores, in Sec. 2.2 . In Table 5.1 we list the

considered PV and VV channels, including @xmath and @xmath . Besides the
latter two OZIS channels and the also observed OZIA @xmath channel, we
furthermore account for the OZIA PV and VV channels @xmath , @xmath ,
and @xmath , whose influence on the @xmath pole position is not
negligible, in spite of being closed channels. The @xmath channel, with
threshold about 350 MeV above the @xmath mass, we do not include.
The relative couplings of the OZIA channels have been computed as
discussed in Sec. 2.2 .
Couplings calculated in the latter scheme for ground-state mesons
generally coincide with the usual recouplings of spin, isospin, and
orbital angular momentum. Moreover, for excited states the formalism
yields clear predictions as well, contrary to other appoaches. In Table
5.1 , the squares of the ground-state ( @xmath ) couplings are given,
which have to be multiplied by @xmath for the @xmath -wave PV channels,
and by @xmath for the others, so as to obtain the couplings in the RSE
sum of Eq. ( 2.28 ). Also note that the two (closed) @xmath channels
have been lumped together, with their average threshold value and sum of
squared couplings. As for the couplings of the @xmath and @xmath
channels, the formalism of Ref. [ 48 ] , based on OZIA decay via @xmath
quark-pair creation, cannot make any prediction. However, we know from
experiment that the couplings of OZIS channels are considerably smaller
than those of OZIA channels. Moreover, isospin-breaking channels are
even further suppressed. Thus, in the following we shall employ the
values @xmath and @xmath , which correspond to effective relative
strengths of 0.49% and 4.41%, respectively, which seem reasonable to us.
These values may also be compared to the corresponding relative
probabilites of about 0.65% ( @xmath ) and 4.5% ( @xmath ),
respectively, employed in Ref. [ 110 ] . Furthermore, we shall also test
coupling values twice as large, namely @xmath and @xmath . Note that our
coupling for the isospin-breaking channel @xmath is also in rough
agreement with estimates from the rate of the observed [ 80 ]
isospin-violating @xmath decay, which amounts to about 1.5% of the total
width. Another difference between OZIA and OZIS channels is the average
distance @xmath (see Eqs. ( 2.29 , 2.30 )) at which a light @xmath pair
is created before decay, which in the OZIA case we believe to take place
in the core region and in the OZIS case more in the periphery. Thus, we
employ a larger value for @xmath @xmath than for @xmath , the single
radius used for all OZIA channels. Concretely, we take @xmath GeV @xmath
fm and @xmath GeV @xmath fm, while we also test the case @xmath .
For the bare @xmath energy levels @xmath in the RSE sum of Eq. ( 2.28 ),
we take the equidistant harmonic oscillator ( 2.31 ) with the parameters
in Eq. ( 2.32 ), as previously. The only parameter we adjust freely is
the overall coupling constant @xmath in Eqs. ( 2.29 , 2.30 ), which is
tuned to move the bare @xmath state from 3979 MeV down to the @xmath
threshold, requiring a @xmath value of the order of 3, i.e., not far
from the values used in e.g. Chpater 3 and Ref. [ 44 ] . At the same
time, the bare @xmath state shifts from 3599 MeV down to about 3.55 GeV,
though depending quite sensitively on the precise form of the used
subthreshold suppression of closed channels Chpater 3 . Anyhow, for the
purpose of the present study, an accurate reproduction of the @xmath
mass of 3511 MeV is not very relevant.

### 5.2 @xmath poles and amplitudes vs. data

In Table 5.2 , we give some pole positions in the vicinity of the

@xmath and @xmath thresholds, with the chosen values of @xmath and
@xmath . In Fig. 5.1 , third-sheet pole trajectories

in the complex energy plane (relative to the @xmath threshold) are
plotted, as a function of @xmath , with the pole positions of Table 5.2
marked by bullets and stars. The solid curves represent the case @xmath
GeV @xmath , while the dotted ones stand for @xmath GeV @xmath , showing
little sensitivity to the precise decay radius. Figure 5.1 shows that
the @xmath resonance pole may come out below the @xmath threshold with a
nonvanishing width, which is moreover of the right order of magnitude,
viz. @xmath MeV. The recent CDF [ 97 ] mass determination of the @xmath
might suggest that the pole positions ’3’ or ‘c’ (see Table 5.2 and Fig.
5.1 ) are favored. However, one should realize that the differences
amount to mere fractions of an MeV, while experimental uncertainties are
at least of the same order.

Now we compare the corresponding @xmath amplitudes to Belle [ 117 ] data
, for the six cases labeled ‘1, 2, 3’, and ’a, b, c’ in Table 5.2 and
Fig. 5.1 . The results are depicted in Figs. 5.2 and 5.2 , respectively.
Note that

we allow for an arbitrary normalization of the data, which is inevitable
as we are dealing with production data, which cannot be directly
compared with our scattering amplitudes, also because of the finite
experimental mass bins. From these figures we see that the best
agreement with data is obtained in case ‘2’, though 5 out of the 6
curves pass through all error bars. Nevertheless, in view of the large
errors, one should be very cautious in drawing definite conclusions on
the precise pole position as well as the preferred OZIS couplings @xmath
and @xmath .
Next we show, in Fig. 5.3 , the elastic amplitudes in the @xmath and
@xmath channels, corresponding to the pole positions 1, 2, 3, i.e., for
the smaller values of the OZIS couplings. We see that both amplitudes
are very sensitive to the precise pole position, which

is logical, as the OZIS channels couple much more weakly to @xmath than
@xmath , so that the latter channel will strongly deplete the former
ones, as soon as it acquires some phase space. This is in line with our
analysis in e.g. Ref. [ 118 ] . Also note the strongly cusp-like
structure of the amplitude in the cases 2 and 3 for @xmath , and 3 for
@xmath , which is a manifestation of the depletion due to the opening of
the @xmath channel. Such a cusp makes the experimental determination of
the @xmath width very difficult.
In Fig. 5.4 we take a closer look at the @xmath and @xmath amplitudes,
in particular how they compare to one another. Now, the effective
strength of the @xmath elastic @xmath -matrix element is 9 times that of
@xmath , as its coupling has been chosen 3 times as large (see Table 5.2
and Eqs. ( 2.29 – 2.28 )). For the corresponding square amplitudes
plotted in Fig. 5.4 , this amounts to a factor as large as 81. However,
the central @xmath threshold lies more than 7 MeV above that of @xmath ,
while the full @xmath width is only 8.49 MeV. On the other hand, the
central @xmath threshold lies much closer to @xmath , while the large
physical @xmath width strongly boosts the associated amplitude, as
demonstrated below. Qualitative arguments in agreement with our
calculation were already presented in Ref. [ 119 ] . These effects make
the maximum @xmath square amplitude to be only a factor 3.5–4 larger
than that of @xmath , both in case 2 and 3, as can be read off from Fig.
5.4 . Moreover, at the precise energy of the respective pole position,
the two amplitudes are almost equal in size. Therefore, the observed
branching ratio @xmath [ 98 , 99 ] is compatible with the present model
calculation.

Finally, in order to study the effect of using a complex mass for the
@xmath in the @xmath channel, we vary the @xmath width from 0% to 100%
of its PDG [ 80 ] value and plot the corresponding amplitudes in Fig.
5.5 . We see that the maximum @xmath increases by almost 3 orders of
magnitude when going from the 0% case (dotted curve in left-hand plot)
to the 100% case (solid curve in right-hand plot). Furthermore, the 0%
curve only starts out at the central @xmath threshold, of course. Thus,
it becomes clear that no realistic description of the @xmath channel is
possible without smearing out somehow its threshold, so that its
influence kicks in before the @xmath channel opens and depletes the
signal. Naturally, similar conclusions apply in principle to the @xmath
channel, though there the effects are less pronounced because of the
small @xmath width and the somewhat higher threshold. These results show
that our unitarization procedure for complex masses in the asymptotic
states performs as expected in accounting for thresholds involving
resonances.

To conclude our discussion, we should mention that our results are
qualitatively in agreement with those of Danilkin & Simonov [ 108 ] , in
the sense that a single resonance pole originating from the @xmath
@xmath state is capable of describing the @xmath data. However, we
disagree with their conclusions on the @xmath state. In an earlier,
single-channel description [ 120 ] , we found a resonance at 3946 MeV
with a width of 58 MeV, and we do not believe a detailed multichannel
calculation will change these values dramatically. Thus, the listed
@xmath [ 80 ] resonance, with mass 3916 MeV, width 40 MeV, and positive
@xmath -parity, appears to be a good candidate. As for the @xmath state,
the @xmath [ 80 ] resonance, with mass 3942 MeV, width 37 MeV, and
principal decay mode @xmath , seems the obvious choice. With the old
@xmath meanwhile identified as the @xmath ( @xmath [ 80 ] ) state, we
might so understand all 4 charmonium states in the range 3.87–3.95 MeV.

### 5.3 Summary and conclusions

Summarizing, we have investigated the @xmath charmonium scenario for the
@xmath resonance, by analyzing in detail the influence of the @xmath ,
@xmath , and @xmath channels on pole positions and amplitudes. In order
to describe the latter OZIS channels in a realistic way, we have used
complex masses for the @xmath and @xmath , and then restored unitarity
of the @xmath -matrix by a new and rigorous algebraic procedure, albeit
physically heuristic. It is true that the redefined @xmath -matrix may
have some unusual analyticity properties [ 115 ] , but in our amplitudes
no sign was found of any nearby spurious singularities. Moreover, the
behaviour of the @xmath amplitude as a function of the @xmath width
gives us confidence in our approach. Concretely, we have shown that our
scenario is compatible with the @xmath and @xmath data, with a single
resonance pole on top of or slightly below the @xmath threshold.
Moreover, our treatment of the @xmath and @xmath channels has proven
compatible with the observed branching ratio of these decays.
Thus, the data do not seem to require a molecular or tetraquark
interpretation of the @xmath , also in view of so far unobserved [ 121 ]
charged partner states.
Nevertheless, only further improved measurements and theoretical
calculations will in the end allow to draw a definitive conclusion on
the scenario preferred by nature.
In conclusion, we must stress that the @xmath , whatever its assignment,
is an extraordinary structure, because of its coincidence — to an
accuracy of less than 1 MeV — with the central thresholds of the
principal decay modes. This circumstance is at the same time a blessing
and a curse. To start with the latter, no model can ambition to
quantitatively describe the @xmath with present-day state-of-the-art in
strong interactions, while experiment will have an extremely hard time
to reduce the bin sizes to less than 1 MeV and simultaneously keep
statistics sufficiently high. On the other hand, with a strengthened
effort of both theory and experiment, a wealth of knowledge on
charmonium spectroscopy and strong decay — OZI-allowed as well as
OZI-suppressed — may be gathered by further studying this peculiar
resonance.

## Chapter 6 @xmath is not a true molecule

S. Coito, G. Rupp, and E. van Beveren, EPJC 73 , 2531 (2013).
On the theory side, the discussion about the nature of @xmath continues
most vivid. Even before the recent result of LHCb [ 100 ] , most model
builders described the state as an axial vector. For instance, model
calculations of semi-inclusive @xmath processes [ 122 ] as well as
electromagnetic @xmath decays [ 123 ] have been shown to disfavor the
@xmath scenario. The same conclusion was reached in a tetraquark
description of @xmath [ 124 ] , while pion exchange in a molecular
picture would be repulsive in this case [ 125 ] and so inhibitive of a
bound state. Finally, unquenching a @xmath @xmath state by including
meson-meson loops could only further lower the bare mass, which lies in
the range 3.79–3.84 GeV for all quenched quark models we know of, thus
making a @xmath charmonium resonance at 3.872 GeV very unlikely. For
further information and more references concerning @xmath , see e.g. a
recent review [ 126 ] , as well as our previous coupled-channel analysis
in Chapter 5 .
The first suggestion of possible meson-meson molecules bound by pion
exchange, in particular a @xmath state with quantum numbers @xmath or
@xmath , was due to Törnqvist [ 125 ] . With the discovery of @xmath
just below the @xmath threshold, this idea was revived, of course. In
the present chapter, we intend to study the issue, not from Törnqvist’s
pion-exchange point of view, but rather as regards its possible
implications for models based on quark degrees of freedom. In this
context, it is worthwhile to quote from Ref. [ 116 ] , in which a
molecular interpretation is advocated (also see Ref. [ 127 ] ):

  “Independent of the original mechanism for the resonance, the strong
  coupling transforms the resonance into a bound state just below the
  two-particle threshold if @xmath or into a virtual state just above
  the two-particle threshold if @xmath . If @xmath , the bound state has
  a molecular structure, with the particles having a large mean
  separation of order @xmath .”

(Note that, here, @xmath is the @xmath -wave scattering length.) Also:

  “In this case [ @xmath ], the measured mass @xmath implies
  unambiguously that @xmath must be either a charm meson molecule or a
  virtual state of charm mesons.”

In face of these peremptory claims about the molecular picture, it is of
utmost importance to study in detail the @xmath wave function for a
model in which the mechanism generating the meson is quark confinement
combined with strong decay. Thus, we employ the simplified,
coordinate-space version of of RSE, defined in Sec. 2.3 , to describe
@xmath as a unitarized and mass-shifted @xmath charmonium state. The
model’s exact solvability then allows to obtain analytic expressions for
the wave-function components, and follow bound-state as well as
resonance poles on different Riemann sheets.

### 6.1 The coupled @xmath-@xmath system

Now we apply the formalism to the coupled @xmath - @xmath system. The
@xmath channel is assumed to be in a @xmath state, i.e., with @xmath ,
implying the @xmath channel to have @xmath or 2. Nevertheless, we shall
restrict ourselves here to the @xmath -wave channel only, which will be
strongly dominant, especially near threshold. The fixed parameters are
given in Table 6.1 , where the meson masses are from the

PDG [ 39 ] , while @xmath and the constituent charm quark mass @xmath
are defined in ( 2.32 ). Thus, from Eq. ( 2.31 ) we get the lowest two
harmonic oscilator states at @xmath MeV and @xmath MeV, respectively.
The former should give rise — after unquenching — to the @xmath
charmonium state @xmath [ 39 ] , with mass @xmath MeV, while the latter
is the bare @xmath state, which cannot so easily be linked to resonances
in the PDG tables, though both @xmath and @xmath are possible
candidates, in view of their mass and dominant @xmath decay mode [ 39 ]
. However, @xmath may just as well be the, so far unconfirmed, @xmath (
@xmath ) state @xmath , cf. Sec. 5.2 .
The two remaining parameters, viz. the string-breaking distance @xmath
and the global coupling @xmath , have to be adjusted to the experimental
data. Nevertheless, these parameters are not completely free, as they
both have a clear physical interpretation, albeit of an empirical
nature. Thus, @xmath is the average interquark separation at which
@xmath quark-pair creation/annihilation is supposed to take place, while
@xmath is the overall coupling strength for such processes. Note that we
do not assume a particular microscopic model for string breaking
inspired by QCD, like e.g. in a very recent paper [ 128 ] . Still, the
values of @xmath found in the present work are in rough agreement with
our prior model findings, and even compatible [ 129 ] with a lattice
study of string breaking in QCD [ 130 ] . Concretely, we have been
obtaining values of @xmath in the range 1–4 GeV @xmath (0.2–0.8 fm),
logically dependent on quark flavor, since the string-breaking distance
will scale with the meson’s size, being smallest for bottomonium. As for
the coupling parameter @xmath , its empirical value will depend on
@xmath , but also on the set of included decay channels. In realistic
calculations, values of the order of 3 have been obtained (see
e.g. Table 5.2 , where @xmath ).

### 6.2 Poles

The crucial test the present model must pass is its capability of
generating a pole near the @xmath threshold. Indeed, a dynamical pole is
found slightly below threshold for different combinations of the free
parameters @xmath and @xmath , several of which are listed in Table 6.2
. Examples are here given of bound states, virtual bound states, and
below-threshold resonances, the latter ones only occurring for @xmath
-wave thresholds as in our case. Note that poles of both virtual bound
states and resonances lie on the second Riemann sheet, i.e., the
relative momentum has a negative imaginary part. From this table we also
observe that larger and larger couplings are needed to generate a pole
close to threshold when @xmath approaches the value 3.5 GeV @xmath . We
shall see below that this is due to the nodal structure of the
bound-state wave function.

Although a dynamical pole shows up near the @xmath threshold, there
still should be a confinement pole connected to the first radial @xmath
excitation at 3979 MeV. Well, we do find such a pole, for each entry in
Table 6.2 . In Table 6.3 a few cases are collected, with the parameters
tuned to generate a dynamical pole at precisely the @xmath PDG [ 39 ]
mass of 3871.68 MeV. Note, however, that the associated confinement pole
is not necessarily of physical relevance, since at the corresponding
energy several other strong decay channels are open, which no doubt will
have a very considerable influence and possibly even change the nature
of both poles. As a matter of fact, in Chapter 5 , with all relevant
two-meson channels included, the @xmath resonance was found as a
confinement pole, whereas dynamical poles were only encountered very
deep in the complex energy plane, without any observable effect at real
energies. So here we show these results only to illustrate that pole
doubling may occur when strongly coupling @xmath -wave thresholds are
involved, as we have observed in the past in the case of e.g. the light
scalar mesons [ 131 ] and @xmath [ 43 ] . The issue of confinement
vs. dynamical poles will be further studied in Sec. 6.5 .
In order to better understand the dynamics of the different poles, we
plot in Fig. 6.1 pole trajectories in the complex energy plane as a
function of the coupling constant @xmath , and for three different
values of @xmath . For vanishing @xmath , the dynamical pole acquires a
negative infinite imaginary part and so disappears in the continuum,
whereas the confinement pole moves to the real energy level of the bare
@xmath state, i.e., 3979 MeV.

As @xmath increases, and for both @xmath GeV @xmath and @xmath GeV
@xmath , the dynamical pole moves to the real axis below threshold,
becoming first a virtual bound state and then a genuine bound state.
Note that, in the latter case, the real part twice attains the @xmath
mass even before the pole reaches the real axis, but the corresponding
imaginary parts are much too large as compared with experiment [ 39 ] ,
so only the bound state can be considered physical. Finally, for @xmath
GeV @xmath the pole does never reach the real axis, which would require
an infinite coupling. For the other parameter sets listed in Table 6.2 ,
we find intermediate situations. Another feature we can observe for all
trajectories is an initial attraction and subsequent repulsion between
the dynamical and the confinement poles.

### 6.3 Wave function

Now we are in a position to study the @xmath bound-state wave function
in several situations. We choose two values for the string-breaking
parameter, viz. @xmath GeV @xmath and @xmath GeV @xmath . In Table 6.4
five different binding energies (BEs) are chosen with respect to the
@xmath channel, including the PDG [ 39 ] value labeled by @xmath . We
have computed and normalized (see Subsec. 2.3.1 ) the two-component
radial wave function @xmath for each of the five cases. In Fig. 6.2 we
depict the cases labeled by @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , the other two
representing intermediate situations. General features we immediately
observe are the typical @xmath -wave behavior of the @xmath
wave-function component @xmath , while the @xmath wave function @xmath
is in a @xmath state, the latter also having a node, as it is dominantly
a first radial excitation. Furthermore, @xmath is larger than @xmath in
most situations, for all @xmath , except for unphysically large BEs
(cf. plot @xmath ). Nevertheless, the two components are of comparable
size for intermediate @xmath values. Then, as the BE becomes smaller,
the tail of @xmath grows longer, as expected, whereas @xmath always
becomes negligible for distances larger than roughly 11–12 GeV @xmath .
Now, the increased @xmath tail affects the normalization of both @xmath
and @xmath . Thus, the ratio @xmath is quite robust for most @xmath
values, as it does not significantly change with the BE.

### 6.4 Probabilities and r.m.s. radii

Having derived the @xmath wave function for several scenarios, we can
now straightforwardly compute the relative probabilities of the @xmath
and @xmath components (see Subsec. 2.3.1 ), with the results given in
Table 6.5 , for the

five BEs and two @xmath values from Table 6.4 . Note that the
probability in the @xmath channel is only computed for normalization
purposes, since in a more realistic calculation at least the @xmath
component would acquire a nonnegligible probability as well, as the
corresponding threshold lies only 8 MeV higher. Nevertheless, our
simplification is unlikely to have an appreciable effect on the @xmath
probability and will only increase that of the @xmath component
accordingly. Also note that the @xmath probability includes all @xmath
states, with the @xmath being dominant, because the corresponding bare
eigenstate lies only 100 MeV higher. However, also the @xmath state is
nonnegligible in the physical @xmath wave function. In the
coupled-channel approach of Ref. [ 132 ] , a @xmath admixture of about
15% was found. Notice that — inevitably — unquenching not only mixes
meson-meson components into the total bound-state wave function, but
also quark-antiquark components of confinement states other than the one
under consideration (also see Ref. [ 51 ] ). Here, for a BE of 0.16 MeV,
corresponding to the physical [ 39 ] @xmath , case @xmath in Table 6.5 ,
has a 7.48% @xmath probability for @xmath GeV @xmath and 11.18% for
@xmath GeV @xmath . For smaller BEs, the @xmath probability decreases as
expected, because of the growing weight of the @xmath tail. On the other
hand, for a BE of 10 MeV and @xmath GeV @xmath , the charmonium
probability becomes even larger than that of the meson-meson component.
Now, the experimental errors in the average mass of the @xmath and the
@xmath threshold allow for a maximum BE of 0.57 MeV, i.e., somewhere in
between cases @xmath and @xmath . This would then correspond to a @xmath
probability roughly midway in the range 7.48%–16.98% ( @xmath GeV @xmath
) or 11.18%–24.65% ( @xmath GeV @xmath ). In the limiting case of zero
binding, the @xmath probability would eventually vanish. Also notice
that, in all five cases of Table 6.5 , the @xmath probability rises by
about 50% when @xmath is increased from 2.0 to 3.0 GeV @xmath .
Nevertheless, if we take @xmath GeV @xmath as in Chapter 5 , we get a
@xmath probability of 7.48%, very close the 7% found in Refs. [ 133 ,
134 ] .
Next we use the normalized wave functions and Eq. ( 2.53 ) to compute
the @xmath r.m.s. radius for the five cases discussed before (see Table
6.4 ), with the results presented in Table 6.6 .

It is interesting to observe that the r.m.s. radius, which in principle
is an observable, is much less sensitive to the choice of @xmath than de
wave-function probabilities. Furthermore, the large to very large
r.m.s. radii in the various situations are hardly surprising, in view of
the small binding energies and the resulting very long tails of the
@xmath wave-function components (see Fig. 6.2 above).
Using Eq. ( 2.54 ), we now also evaluate the @xmath -wave scattering
length

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In case @xmath and for @xmath GeV @xmath we thus find @xmath fm, which
is large yet of the expected order of magnitude for a BE of 0.16 MeV.
For even smaller BEs, the scattering length will further increase,
roughly like @xmath . Let us here quote from Ref. [ 127 ] :

  “Low-energy universality implies that as the scattering length @xmath
  increases, the probabilities for states other than @xmath or @xmath
  decrease as @xmath …”

Indeed, we verify from our Table 6.5 that — very roughly — the @xmath
probability decreases as @xmath , and so like @xmath .

### 6.5 Stability of results and nature of poles

In this section we are going to study the stability of our results, as
well as the nature of the found solutions. So let us vary the two
usually fixed parameters, viz. @xmath and @xmath , in such a way that
the bare @xmath mass remains unaltered at 3599 MeV, whereas that of the
@xmath changes as shown in Table. 6.7 .

Thus, in case @xmath @xmath is lowered by @xmath MeV, while in case
@xmath it rises by @xmath MeV. The trajectories for these two new
situations are plotted in Fig. 6.3 .

For @xmath we observe that, just as in the standard case depicted in
Fig. 6.1 , two poles are found relatively close to the real axis, of a
dynamical and a confinement origin, respectively. However, now it is the
@xmath confinement pole that moves steadily downwards and settles on the
real axis below threshold, whereas the dynamical pole moves to higher
energies and eventually approaches the real axis. So the poles
interchange their roles when going from the standard case to case @xmath
. Nevertheless, the values of @xmath needed to get a bound state at
3871.68 MeV are not very different in the two cases, viz. 1.172
vs. 1.034. Such a behavior was already observed almost a decade ago,
namely for @xmath [ 39 ] charmed-strange meson. In a first, two-channel
model calculation [ 43 ] the @xmath showed up as a dynamical resonance,
settling below the @xmath -wave @xmath threshold, whereas the @xmath
@xmath state turned out to move to higher energies, with a large width,
similarly to the standard @xmath case in Figs. 6.1 and 6.3 above.
However, in a more complete, multichannel approach [ 46 ] the situations
got reversed, just as in the present case @xmath . Also in previous
Chapter 5 , with nine coupled channels, we reproduced the meson as a
confinement pole. What appears to happen in the present case @xmath is
that shifting the bare @xmath state to somewhat lower energies is just
enough to deflect the confinement pole to the left and not the right
when approaching the continuum pole. Clearly, there will be an
intermediate situation for which the left/right deflection will hinge
upon only marginal changes in the parameters, but resulting in two
completely different trajectories. Therefore, identifying one pole as
dynamical and the other as linked to a confinement state is entirely
arbitrary, the whole system being dynamical because of unquenching. At
the end of the day, the only thing that really counts is where the poles
end up for the final parameters. The trajectories themselves are not
observable and only serve as an illustration how a coupled-channel model
as the one employed here mimics the physical situation. Suffice it to
say that the lower pole, representing the @xmath , is quite stable with
respect to variations in the parameters, owing to its proximity to the
only and most relevant OZI-allowed decay channel. The higher pole, on
the other hand, should not be taken at face value, since a more
realistic calculation should include other important decay channels,
such as @xmath , with threshold just above 4 GeV.
Concerning the other scenario with changed parameters, labeled @xmath in
Table 6.7 and depicted in the lower graph of Fig. 6.3 , we see that the
trajectories do not change qualitatively when going from the standard
case to @xmath . There is a displacement of the right-hand branch, about
100 MeV to the right on average, in accordance with the same shift of
the bare @xmath state. But the change in the lower, dynamical branch, is
much less significant, though the value of @xmath needed to produce a
bound state at 3871-68 MeV now increases to 1.572 (see Table 6.7 ). We
also notice from Fig. 6.3 that the two pole-trajectory branches hardly
move towards one another, signaling less attraction between the poles
due to a larger initial separation.
Inspecting again Table 6.7 as for the @xmath probability in cases @xmath
and @xmath compared to the standard situation, we observe an increased
value for case @xmath and a decreased one for @xmath . This is logical,
since in case @xmath the bare @xmath state lies closer to the @xmath ,
whereas in case @xmath it lies farther away. Nevertheless, the
difference in @xmath probability between @xmath and @xmath is only about
3%, i.e., less than the variation with @xmath in the standard case.
These comparisons lend further support to the stability of our results.
Finally, in Fig. 6.4 we compare the wave function for case @xmath with
the

standard one. We see there is no visible change in the @xmath component.
As for @xmath , the first maximum gets somewhat reduced, but the
secondary, negative bump even becomes a bit larger, owing to an inward
shift of the node, lying now at about 3 GeV @xmath . Yet, also in case
@xmath the @xmath component is still very significant, despite the large
separation of more than 200 MeV between the @xmath bound state and the
bare @xmath state.
From the latter and all previous results we may safely conclude that the
@xmath component of the @xmath wave function remains nonnegligible in a
variety of scenarios, being even of comparable size as the @xmath
component in the inner region, save at very short distances.

### 6.6 Summary and conclusions

In the present chapter, we have employed a simple and solvable
Schrödinger model to study the wave function of the @xmath meson, by
treating it as a coupled @xmath - @xmath system with @xmath quantum
numbers. Transitions between the two channels are described with the
@xmath mechanism, through string breaking at a sharp distance @xmath .
The exact solutions to the equations allow us to easily study the
trajectories of @xmath -matrix poles as a function of the decay coupling
constant @xmath . Thus, a dynamical pole is found, becoming a bound
state just below the @xmath threshold, for different string-breaking
distances @xmath , and an appropriate coupling @xmath . On the other
hand, the pole arising from the bare @xmath confinement state moves to
higher energies and acquires a large imaginary part. However, the latter
pole may not be very relevant physically, because of neglected
additional meson-meson channels which will become important in that
energy region.
As for the @xmath radial wave function, the @xmath component @xmath
turns out to be of significant size as compared to the @xmath component
@xmath , especially for intermediate @xmath values. Moreover, even for
other trial BEs, the global shape of @xmath and its relative magnitude
vis-à-vis @xmath in the central region is remarkably stable. But the
corresponding @xmath probability is relatively low, due to the very long
tail of the @xmath wave function at small binding. These results are
along the lines of the analysis based on general arguments presented in
Ref. [ 135 ] . Quantitatively, for the average [ 39 ] @xmath binding of
0.16 MeV, a @xmath probability of 7.5–11.2% is found, for @xmath in the
range 0.4–0.6 fm, which is compatible with other recent approaches [ 133
, 134 ] . The corresponding r.m.s. radius turns out to be quite stable
at about 7.8 fm, for the latter range of @xmath values, while the @xmath
-wave scattering length of 11.6 fm, for @xmath fm, is in agreement with
expectations for a BE of 0.16 MeV.
Finally, we have studied the nature of the @xmath -matrix pole giving
rise to @xmath , by varying some of the otherwise fixed parameters.
Thus, a drastic modification of pole trajectories is observed, for
relatively small parameter variations, making the @xmath pole transform
from a dynamical pole into one directly connected to the @xmath bare
confinement state. However, the corresponding changes in the @xmath
probability and r.m.s. radius, as well as the coupling @xmath needed to
reproduce @xmath , are quite modest.
In conclusion, we should revisit the claims about @xmath made in Ref. [
116 ] , quoted in the Introduction above, namely about the inevitability
of @xmath being a charm-meson molecule or virtual state, independently
of the mechanism generating the state. Now, it is true that our analysis
has confirmed some of the quantitative predictions in Ref. [ 116 ] ,
viz. concerning the vanishing probability of wave-function components
other than @xmath as the BE approaches zero, and the related behavior of
the @xmath scattering length. However, we have also shown that the
@xmath component is certainly not negligible and quite stable, in a
variety of scenarios. Especially in electromagnetic processes, the
prominence of this component for relatively small as well as
intermediate @xmath values will no doubt result in a significant
contribution to the amplitudes. Moreover, as already mentioned above,
the very unquenching of a @xmath @xmath state will not only introduce
meson-meson components into the wave function, but also a contribution
of the @xmath @xmath state, which can change predictions of
electromagnetic transition rates very considerably [ 132 ] . We intend
to study such processes for @xmath in future work, on the basis of a
model as the one used in the present paper, by employing the formalism
developed and successfully applied in Ref. [ 136 ] . However, in a
detailed and predictive calculation of electromagnetic @xmath decays,
the inclusion of the charged @xmath channel will be indispensable [ 137
] .
For all these reasons, we do not consider @xmath a charm-meson molecule,
but rather a very strongly unitarized charmonium state. As a matter of
fact, we do not believe any non-exotic mesonic resonance — whatever its
origin — qualifies as a true meson-meson molecule, simply because such a
state will inexorably mix with the nearest @xmath states having the same
quantum numbers. Indeed, we have demonstrated above that, even with a
bare @xmath state 200 MeV higher in mass, the resulting @xmath component
in the wave function is still appreciable. So let us conclude this
discussion by quoting and fully endorsing the following statement from
Ref. [ 116 ] :

  “Any model of the @xmath that does not take into account its strong
  coupling to charm meson scattering states should not be taken
  seriously.”

## Chapter 7 Summary and Conclusions

The RSE coupled-channel model defined in Sec. 2.2 was applied to three
different meson sectors, namely the isoscalar vector @xmath , the
axial-vectors - pseudovectors with open-charm @xmath and @xmath , and
the charmonium-like axial-vector @xmath . A harmonic-oscillator (HO)
confining potential was used with fixed parameters for frequency and
constituent quark masses (c.q.m.), Eq. ( 2.32 ), values defined in Ref.
[ 47 ] . The frequency of 190 MeV has been used in all RSE applications,
and the c.q.m. are in agreement with other spectroscopy models. Only two
free parameters are left, the dimensionless global coupling @xmath and
the “string-breaking” distance @xmath . For the present RSE applications
their range is between 2 and 4 GeV @xmath , and between 1.2 and 4,
respectively for @xmath and @xmath . We see these values are pretty
close, considering a likely c.q.m. dependence of the parameters, as well
as the set of included decay channels.
This work may shed light on the excited @xmath @xmath states and on the
classification of the @xmath resonance, originally denoted @xmath .
Among the model’s @xmath -matrix poles, there are good candidates for
observed resonances, as well as other ones that should exist according
to the quark model. Besides the expected resonances as unitarized
confinement states, a dynamical resonance pole is found at @xmath MeV.
The huge width makes its interpretation as the @xmath somewhat dubious.
On the other hand, the calculated resonances originating in the
confinement spectrum are generally too narrow. We consider the inclusion
of sharp thresholds only as the main problem of our description.
Including the widths of final-state resonances could probably increase
the widths of the now too narrow excited @xmath resonances stemming from
the confinement spectrum. Since a simple substitution of the here used
real masses by the true complex masses destroys the manifest unitarity
of the @xmath -matrix, to account for the nonvanishing widths of mesons
in the coupled channels is a very difficult problem. The formalism
described in Subsec. 2.2.1 was developed a posteriori and has not been
applied to the @xmath vectors.
We dynamically reproduced the whole pattern of masses and widths of the
axial-vector - pseudovector charmed mesons, by coupling the most
important open and closed two-meson channels to bare @xmath @xmath and
@xmath states containing both @xmath and @xmath components. The coupling
to two-meson channels dynamically mixes and lifts the mass degeneracy of
the spectroscopic @xmath and @xmath states, as an alternative to the
usual spin-orbit splitting. Of the two resulting @xmath -matrix poles in
either case, one stays very close to the energy of the bare state, as a
quasi-bound state in the continuum, whereas the other shifts
considerably. This is in agreement with the experimental observation
that the @xmath and @xmath have much smaller widths than one would
naively expect. Predictions for pole positions of radially excited
axial-vector charmed mesons are presented.
The nature of the @xmath enhancement was analyzed in the framework of
the RSE, by studying it as a regular @xmath charmonium state, though
strongly influenced and shifted by open-charm decay channels. The
observed but OZI-suppressed @xmath and @xmath channels were coupled as
well, but effectively smeared out by using complex @xmath and @xmath
masses, in order to account for their physical widths, followed by a
rigorous algebraic procedure to restore unitarity. A very delicate
interplay between the @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath channels was
observed. The data clearly suggest that the @xmath is a very narrow
axial-vector @xmath resonance, with a pole at or slightly below the
@xmath threshold.
A solvable coordinate-space model was employed to study the @xmath
component of the @xmath wave function, by coupling a confined @xmath
@xmath state to the almost unbound @xmath -wave @xmath channel via the
@xmath mechanism. The two-component wave function was calculated for
different values of the binding energy and the transition radius @xmath
, always resulting in a significant @xmath component. However, the long
tail of the @xmath wave function, in the case of small binding, strongly
limits the @xmath probability, which roughly lies in the range 7–11%,
for the average experimental binding energy of 0.16 MeV and @xmath
between 2 and 3 GeV @xmath . Furthermore, a reasonable value of 7.8 fm
was obtained for the @xmath r.m.s. radius at the latter binding energy,
as well as an @xmath -wave @xmath scattering length of 11.6 fm. Finally,
the @xmath -matrix pole trajectories as a function of coupling constant
show that @xmath can be generated either as a dynamical pole or as one
connected to the bare @xmath confinement spectrum, depending on details
of the model. From these results we conclude that @xmath is not a
genuine meson-meson molecule, nor actually any other mesonic system with
non-exotic quantum numbers, due to inevitable mixing with the
corresponding quark-antiquark states.
All the studied resonances are controversial, with @xmath , alias @xmath
, and @xmath often thought to be exotics, while the open-charm axials
exhibit an unexpected pattern of masses and widths. Within the
unquenched and unitarized RSE model we are able to reproduce all the
main features of these resonances as observed in experiments.
Furthermore, we have shown, with a simplified Schrödinger model, the
importance of a charmonium component in @xmath . The relevance of
“dressing” the bare states is well known in spectroscopy, and so we
consider the @xmath is indeed the @xmath resonance, strongly influenced
by the @xmath threshold, and strongly deviated from its bare energy due
to the unquenching.

@xmath

Future research work following the present thesis will include the
development of unquenched models, such as the RSE but not only, to
approach enigmatic resonances. In particular, we plan to clarify the
nature of mesonic structures observed in experimental data, and help to
disentangle peaks from resonance poles and nonresonant enhancements due
to threshold openings. Also, we aim to distinguish between intrinsic
resonances, directly linked to a confinement spectrum, and dynamically
generated ones. Another goal is the development of a unitarization
scheme for quenched tetraquark states. At last, the ultimate purpose of
meson spectroscopy is to understand confinement and decay mechanisms,
i.e., the strong interaction itself.
