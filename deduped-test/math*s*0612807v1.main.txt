## Chapter \thechapter Introduction

The Selberg theory (Selberg trace formulas, Selberg zeta-functions, and
related applications) has been well studied in both the two-dimensional
scalar case ( [ Iwa02 ] ) and the two-dimensional vector case ¹ ¹ 1 The
works [ Roe66 ] , [ Hej83 ] , [ Fis87 ] , contain not only the
two-dimensional vector case, but also its generalization, the case of
unitary multiplier systems of arbitrary real weight.
( [ Roe66 ] , [ Ven82 ] , [ Hej83 ] , [ Fis87 ] ). By “Two-dimensional
vector case” we mean: cofinite Fuchsian groups with finite-dimensional
unitary representations, and the “Scalar case” refers to the case with
the trivial representation. Elstrodt, Grunewald and Mennicke extended
the Selberg theory to the three-dimensional scalar case in [ EGM98 ] .
By the “Three-dimensional case” we mean: cofinite Kleinian groups. The
main goal of this thesis is to extend the Selberg theory to the
three-dimensional vector case.

In this thesis we derive the Selberg trace formula for cofinite Kleinian
groups ² ² 2 A Kleinian groups is referred to in some texts as a
discrete group of isometries acting on hyperbolic three-space, or a
discrete subgroup of @xmath
, with finite-dimensional unitary representations. As an application we
define the corresponding Selberg zeta-function and compute its divisor,
thus generalizing results of Elstrodt, Grunewald and Mennicke [ EGM98 ]
to non-trivial unitary representations.

Much of the two-dimensional vector and three-dimensional scalar cases
extends in a straight forward manner to the three-dimensional vector
case. However, the extension of several parts of the Selberg theory are
more subtle in the three-dimensional case, especially in the vector
case. One reason for this is because the set of finite-dimensional
unitary representations of a fixed cofinite Kleinian groups is not well
understood. Another reason is related to the structure of the stabilizer
subgroup of a cusp. In the two-dimensional case the stabilizer subgroup
of a cusp is a purely parabolic group that is isomorphic to a rank-one
lattice, while in three dimensions the stabilizer subgroup of a cusp is
a non-abelian group that contains elliptic elements, with a finite-index
purely parabolic subgroup that is isomorphic to a rank-two lattice. The
presence of elliptic elements in the stabilizer subgroup introduces some
subtleties to the three-dimensional vector case, particularly in the
computation of the divisor of the Selberg zeta-function. In addition,
the fact that the stabilizer subgroup (in the three-dimensional case)
contains a rank-two parabolic subgroup forced us to prove some
additional estimates involving two-dimensional lattice sums.

A Kleinian group is a discrete subgroup of @xmath Each element of @xmath
is identified with a Möbius transformation, and has a well-known action
on hyperbolic three-space @xmath and on its boundary at infinity @xmath
the Riemann sphere @xmath (see [ EGM98 , Section 1.1] ) . A Kleinian
group is cofinite iff it has a fundamental domain @xmath of finite
hyperbolic volume.

We use the following coordinate system for hyperbolic three-space,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with the hyperbolic metric

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and volume form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The Laplace-Beltrami operator is defined by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and it acts on the space of smooth functions @xmath where @xmath is a
finite-dimensional complex vector space with inner-product @xmath

Suppose that @xmath is a cofinite Kleinian group and @xmath ( @xmath is
the space of finite-dimensional unitary representations of @xmath in
@xmath ). Then the Hilbert space of @xmath automorphic functions is
defined by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Here @xmath is a fundamental domain for @xmath in @xmath , and @xmath is
the inner product on @xmath Finally, let @xmath be the corresponding
positive self-adjoint Laplace-Beltrami operator on @xmath

Our first result is the spectral decomposition of @xmath on @xmath (see
Theorem \thechapter .8.1 ). Except for one important point, the proof of
the spectral decomposition theorem is analogous to the two-dimensional
vector and three-dimensional scalar cases. The one important point
being, singularity at a cusp . To the best of the author’s knowledge,
prior to this thesis, the notion of singularity at a cusp was only
defined for cofinite Fuchsian groups [ Sel56 ] [ Roe66 ] [ Ven82 ] [
Hej83 ] . In § \thechapter .1 we extend the notion of singularity to
cofinite Kleinian groups.

In § \thechapter .1 we give an explicit form of the Selberg trace
formula for cofinite Kleinian groups with finite-dimensional unitary
representations (see Theorem \thechapter .7.1 ). The new feature in the
trace formula is a term of the form,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The above term comes about from regularity at a cusp, and its value is
computed using Kronecker’s second limit formula ( see § \thechapter .2
).

As an application of the spectral decomposition theorem we derive an
identity involving conjugacy relations of cuspidal elliptic elements.
This identity is used in the proof of the Selberg trace formula and to
show that under certain conditions, the Selberg zeta function admits a
meromorphic continuation (see Lemma \thechapter .4.4 for the identity).

For @xmath the Selberg zeta-function @xmath is defined by the following
product

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In § \thechapter .1 we introduce the various definitions and notations
that are needed in order to define the zeta function, and
meromorphically ³ ³ 3 We give the meromorphic continuation for certain
cases, and for others show that the zeta function is a rational root of
a meromorphic function.
continue @xmath to @xmath while computing its divisor. The main new
difficulty is handling the contribution of the cuspidal elliptic
elements to the topological (or trivial) zeros and poles of @xmath We
show the following in § \thechapter .3 :

###### Corollary.

Let @xmath and @xmath (the trivial representation). Then @xmath is not a
meromorphic function ⁴ ⁴ 4 This is the first example that the author is
aware of where the Selberg zeta-function is not meromorphic.
(it is the 6-th root of a meromorphic function).

In addition, the methods of § \thechapter .3 imply that the Selberg
zeta-function of the Picard group is meromorphic:

###### Corollary.

Let @xmath and let @xmath Then @xmath is a meromorphic function.

## Chapter \thechapter Prerequisite Material

In order to make our presentation self-contained, we present some
well-known results concerning hyperbolic three-space, the
Laplace-Beltrami operator, and cofinite Kleinian groups. For more
details see [ EGM98 ] .

It follows that @xmath and that @xmath is a point-pair invariant ⁷ ⁷ 7 A
point-pair invariant is a map @xmath defined almost everywhere
satisfying @xmath for all @xmath , @xmath
.

We can use the concept of a point-pair invariant to construct the
resolvent kernel for @xmath For @xmath set

@xmath with eigenvalue @xmath depending only on the eigenvalue @xmath
and not on the particular eigenfunction.

The map sending @xmath to holomorphic function @xmath above is called
the Selberg-Harish-Chandra transform of @xmath

### \thechapter.3 Kleinian Groups

A subgroup @xmath is called a Kleinian group if for each @xmath the
orbit @xmath has no accumulation points in @xmath . An equivalent
formulation is that @xmath is a discrete subset of @xmath in the
topology induced from @xmath

A closed subset @xmath is called a fundamental domain of @xmath if

-   @xmath meets each @xmath orbit at least once,

-   the interior @xmath meets each @xmath orbit at most once,

-   the boundary of @xmath has Lebesgue measure zero.

For each @xmath the set

cofinite.

one of the following categories:

-   parabolic if @xmath and @xmath

-   elliptic if @xmath and @xmath

-   loxodromic if it is neither elliptic nor parabolic .

There is a useful geometric characterization of the above notions. An
element @xmath is

-   parabolic ¹¹ ¹¹ 11 See the previous footnote.
    iff it has exactly one fixed point in @xmath ,

-   elliptic iff it has two fixed points in @xmath and fixes the
    geodesic line in @xmath connecting the two points.

-   loxodromic iff it has two fixed points in @xmath and has no fixed
    points in @xmath

The group @xmath is the stabilizer subgroup of @xmath that fixes @xmath
and @xmath is the maximal parabolic subgroup of @xmath It contains all
parabolic elements fixing @xmath and the identity element.

A point @xmath is called a cusp of @xmath if @xmath is a free abelian
group of rank two. The set of cusps is denoted by @xmath . Two cusps,
@xmath of @xmath called equivalent or @xmath equivalent if ¹² ¹² 12
@xmath denotes the orbit of the point @xmath
@xmath The equivalence class of cusps is denoted by @xmath

The following is well known (see [ EGM98 , Chapter 2] ).

###### Lemma \thechapter.5.1.

Let @xmath be a Kleinian group.

1.   If @xmath contains a parabolic element then @xmath is not
    cocompact.

2.   If @xmath is cofinite and is not cocompact then @xmath contains a
    parabolic element.

3.   If @xmath is cofinite, @xmath , and @xmath contains a parabolic
    element then @xmath is a cusp of @xmath

4.   If @xmath is cofinite then @xmath has only finitely many @xmath
    equivalent classes of cusps.

Next we study the structure ¹³ ¹³ 13 The following structure theorem is
extremely important, and without it we would be unable to extend the
Selberg theory to cofinite Kleinian groups.

Throughout this section @xmath is a cofinite Kleinian group.

###### Lemma \thechapter.7.1.

Let @xmath be cofinite. Then @xmath has only finitely many elliptic
conjugacy classes in @xmath .

###### Proof.

Assume not. Then there is an infinite sequence of elliptic @xmath
conjugacy classes @xmath Next for each @xmath choose representative
@xmath which fixes a point @xmath on the boundary of @xmath the
fundamental domain of @xmath given in Lemma \thechapter .6.4 . Since
@xmath is discrete, the points must accumulate at least at one cusp.

## Chapter \thechapter The Spectral Decomposition Theorem

In this chapter we prove the spectral decomposition theorem for cofinite
Kleinian groups with finite-dimensional unitary representations. While
much of our work is analogous to the two-dimensional vector and
three-dimensional scalar cases ¹⁷ ¹⁷ 17 We encourage the reader to first
read [ EGM98 , Sections 4.1,4.2,4.3,6.1,6.2,6.3,6.4] and [ Ven82 ,
Chapter 1,2,3]
there are some new complications that arise because of cuspidal elliptic
elements ¹⁸ ¹⁸ 18 Fuchsian groups do not have cuspidal elliptic
elements. .

### \thechapter.1 Unitary Representations

Throughout this section @xmath is a cofinite Kleinian group with @xmath
and cusp representatives @xmath

Let @xmath be an @xmath -dimensional complex vector space, with an inner
product @xmath linear in the first argument and anti-linear in the
second argument. For @xmath its norm @xmath is given by @xmath and the
norm of a linear operator @xmath is defined as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath

###### Definition \thechapter.1.1.

Define @xmath to be the set of pairs @xmath where @xmath a finite
dimensional complex inner product space and @xmath is a unitary
representation of @xmath in @xmath .

We will abuse notation and identify @xmath with @xmath

###### Definition \thechapter.1.2.

Let @xmath be cofinite, @xmath and @xmath For each @xmath define

#### \thechapter.1.1 Unitary representions of the stabilizer subgroup

###### Lemma \thechapter.1.4.

There exist @xmath with the following properties:

(1) @xmath Here @xmath are parabolic elements with @xmath and @xmath
(here @xmath ) for all @xmath and @xmath is elliptic of order @xmath

(2) @xmath

(3) The elements @xmath and @xmath commute but the group @xmath is not
abelian when @xmath .

(4) If in addition, @xmath then @xmath maps @xmath onto itself.
Furthermore, there exists a basis of @xmath so that @xmath is diagonal.

###### Proof.

(1), (2), and (3) readily follow from [ EGM98 , Theorem 2.1.8] . We
prove (4): set @xmath Since @xmath and @xmath are both parabolic and in
@xmath it follows that the @xmath is parabolic. Since @xmath is
parabolic, @xmath for some @xmath (applying (2)). By definition, the
restriction @xmath We have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Next applying an arbitrary @xmath we obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

Thus @xmath fixes @xmath and similarly @xmath fixes @xmath so by
definition @xmath Since @xmath is unitary, its restriction to @xmath is
also unitary, hence @xmath has a diagonalizing basis. ∎

We remark that for a cusp @xmath of @xmath the group @xmath is abelian.
Thus, the unitary representations @xmath restricted to @xmath is
diagonalizable and can be thought of as a direct sum of one-dimensional
unitary representations of @xmath

### \thechapter.2 Automorphic Functions

The set of @xmath -automorphic functions @xmath is the set of all
Borel-measurable functions @xmath that satisfy @xmath for all @xmath
Such functions are uniquely determined by their values on a fundamental
domain. With this in mind we fix a fundamental domain @xmath for @xmath
and define

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For @xmath define the inner product @xmath With this inner product
@xmath is a Hilbert Space. For @xmath let @xmath be space of @xmath
-automorphic functions which are @xmath -times differentiable on @xmath
.

#### \thechapter.2.1 The Automorphic Laplacian @xmath

Recall that the Laplace-Beltrami operator @xmath is defined on twice
continuously differentiable functions @xmath Thus @xmath can be defined
on the set @xmath and for @xmath it follows (since @xmath commutes with
isometries) that @xmath

Consider the dense subspace @xmath It follows that @xmath is essentially
self-adjoint and has a unique positive self-adjoint extension to a space
@xmath (see [ EGM98 , Section 4.1] ).

###### Definition \thechapter.2.1.

Let @xmath be a cofinite Kleinian group and @xmath We define the
automorphic Laplacian

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

to be the self-adjoint extension of @xmath

When there is little possibility for confusion, we will identify @xmath
with @xmath The dense subspace @xmath can be realized as the set of
functions in @xmath whose distributional Laplacian is in @xmath

### \thechapter.3 Fourier series expansion at a cusp

#### \thechapter.3.1 The scalar case

Let @xmath (that is @xmath and for all @xmath @xmath ), and let @xmath
be a cusp of @xmath with @xmath Then it is easily seen that @xmath in
particular @xmath Since @xmath is isomorphic to the lattice @xmath
@xmath for all @xmath and @xmath That is, @xmath is invariant under that
lattice @xmath If we suppose further that @xmath is smooth then we can
expand @xmath as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Here @xmath is the (real) euclidean inner product in @xmath @xmath is
the lattice dual to @xmath If we assume still further that @xmath and
@xmath for some @xmath then a simple separation of variables argument
(see [ EGM98 , Section 3.3] ) shows that for @xmath @xmath satisfies the
Bessel equation

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

whose general solution is @xmath Here

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The function @xmath decreases exponentially, and @xmath increases
exponentially as @xmath . Applying the growth bound of @xmath we obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

We will need the following fact later on:

###### Lemma \thechapter.3.1.

Let @xmath be a non-negative integer. Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for some constant @xmath

#### \thechapter.3.2 Preliminary Lemmas

Our goal in this section is to come as close as possible to
diagonalizing the group of unitary transformations @xmath Recall that

For each cusp @xmath of @xmath let @xmath denote the orthogonal
projection onto @xmath By definition of singularity, for each @xmath
there exists @xmath satisfying @xmath

Fix a cusp @xmath of @xmath We can partition @xmath as follows:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We will next chose a particular basis of @xmath that respects the
partions above and is a close as possible to diagonalizing @xmath

Recall from Lemma ( \thechapter .1.4 ) that @xmath Here @xmath are
parabolic and @xmath is elliptic.

Let @xmath be an orthonormal basis for @xmath By lemma ( \thechapter
.1.4 ) there exists a set @xmath of orthonormal elements in @xmath
pairwise orthogonal to the elements of @xmath so that the following
conditions are satisfied: For each @xmath for all @xmath and @xmath
where here @xmath is the primitive elliptic element in @xmath chosen in
lemma ( \thechapter .1.4 ), and @xmath with @xmath Finally, there exists
a set @xmath of orthonormal elements of @xmath pairwise orthogonal to
the elements of @xmath so that the following conditions are satisfied:
For each @xmath for each @xmath and some @xmath with @xmath We have
proven the following.

###### Lemma \thechapter.3.2.

For each cusp @xmath let @xmath (see lemma ( \thechapter .1.4 )). Then
there exists an orthonormal basis

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

of @xmath with the following properties:

(1) For each @xmath @xmath for all @xmath

(2) For each @xmath @xmath and @xmath Here @xmath and @xmath

(3) For each @xmath @xmath and @xmath Here @xmath with @xmath and @xmath
are not both equal to one.

For each cusp @xmath and @xmath fix @xmath and @xmath so that

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

We remark that @xmath and @xmath are analogous to the two dimensional
and regular cases respectively (see [ Ven82 ] ). We call @xmath the
almost singular case.

Let @xmath be the orthogonal projection onto the subspace generated by
@xmath

###### Lemma \thechapter.3.3.

Let @xmath

(1) If @xmath then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for all @xmath and @xmath

(2) If @xmath then for @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath

###### Proof.

(1) Let @xmath Since @xmath is isomorphic to @xmath there exists @xmath
satisfying @xmath for all @xmath (See lemma ( \thechapter .1.4 )). Since
@xmath it follows that @xmath However,

     @xmath

Thus,

#### \thechapter.3.3 Fourier Expansion: The vector case

###### Proposition \thechapter.3.4.

Let @xmath be cofinite, @xmath be smooth satisfying @xmath for some
@xmath and each cusp @xmath of @xmath and @xmath with @xmath

(1) If @xmath then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

(2) If @xmath then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

(3) If @xmath @xmath are chosen so that @xmath and @xmath then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath @xmath is the lattice dual to @xmath generated by @xmath
where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the @xmath are scalar multiples of the vector @xmath

###### Proof.

(1) By Lemma \thechapter .3.3 @xmath is a scalar function multiplied by
the vector @xmath thus an application of equation ( \thechapter .3.2 )
concludes the proof.

(2) By (1)

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We will show that @xmath and @xmath are both zero. To see this first,
observe that (by Lemma \thechapter .3.1 )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Next,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

since @xmath for some @xmath that is @xmath fixes the @xmath coordinate
in @xmath (this follows from elementary computations and that fact that
@xmath ). However, we also have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

a contradiction since @xmath

(3) Let @xmath where @xmath Then @xmath satisfies

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

thus by lemma ( \thechapter .3.3 )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for all @xmath and @xmath Thus we can write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which is equivalent to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

To conclude the proof recall that @xmath grows by at most @xmath near
each cusp, and apply the separation of variables technique (see [ EGM98
, page 105] ). ∎

### \thechapter.4 The Eisenstein series

As usual for this section let @xmath be cofinite with cusp
representatives @xmath @xmath and @xmath

#### \thechapter.4.1 Definitions

For @xmath we define the Eisenstein series by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The series @xmath converges uniformly and absolutely on compact subsets
of @xmath and is a @xmath automorphic function that satisfies

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In addition

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for any cusp @xmath

#### \thechapter.4.2 Fourier expansion of the Eisenstein series

In this section we give the explicit Fourier expansion of the Eisenstein
series.

For @xmath a cusp of @xmath and @xmath set @xmath

###### Lemma \thechapter.4.1.

Let @xmath be cusps of @xmath @xmath and @xmath Then

     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

@xmath are the bottom left and bottom right indices respectively of the
two-by-two matrix @xmath

###### Proof.

An application of Proposition \thechapter .3.4 part (1) gives us the
general form of the Fourier series expansion. Then apply the argument
found in [ EGM98 , page 111] . ∎

A Maaß form is a smooth function @xmath satisfying @xmath for some
@xmath and for each cusp @xmath of @xmath and @xmath with @xmath

We saw in proposition ( \thechapter .3.4 ) that for @xmath a Maaß form
@xmath can be expanded as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The @xmath terms will play a promanent role in the what follows. Define
@xmath by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

#### \thechapter.4.3 The scattering matrix

Since the Eisenstein series is a Maaß form, we can apply the function
@xmath to read off its constant term in its Fourier expansion. Define
the scattering matrix @xmath by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We can put the scattering matrix into a @xmath matrix. Let @xmath be the
@xmath matrix given block-wise,

     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath , @xmath .

### \thechapter.5 The Maaß-Selberg Relations

Our main goal in this section is to prove the Maaß-Selberg relations in
the case of cofinite Kleinian groups with finite dimensional unitary
representations. The relations will be needed to prove the Selberg trace
formula. For this section assume @xmath is a cofinite Kleinian group and
@xmath

#### \thechapter.5.1 Greene’s Theorem

The basic tool for proving the Maaß-Selberg relations is Greene’s
Theorem. Let @xmath be compact with a piece-wise smooth boundary, @xmath
be complex valued smooth functions, @xmath the volume form on @xmath and
@xmath the induced volume form on the boundary of @xmath @xmath Then
Greene’s theorem is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Our application of Greene’s theorem will be to the compact part of the
fundamental domain @xmath of @xmath Writing Greene’s theorem in the
global coordinates of @xmath using @xmath @xmath @xmath and Greene’s
Theorem becomes,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

when @xmath is a two-dimensional region parallel to @xmath on the
boundary of @xmath

#### \thechapter.5.2 The scalar Maaß-Selberg relations

For this section, assume @xmath has only one class of cusps and that
@xmath Let @xmath and assume that @xmath has polynomial growth as @xmath
approaches the cusp at @xmath is smooth, and satisfies @xmath (in other
words @xmath is a Maaß form). Let @xmath be the lattice corresponding to
@xmath Then we can expand

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Lemma \thechapter.5.1.

Let @xmath , @xmath with @xmath Assume @xmath has only one cusp at
@xmath and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Let @xmath @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for @xmath Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

Let @xmath (here @xmath is the cusp sector that goes to infinity). Then
by Greene’s theorem

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since the (vertical) sides of @xmath are pair-wise identified by
isometries (with opposite orientation) the only surviving boundary term
is the horizontal cross section (the boundary where @xmath was separated
into @xmath and @xmath ). Greene’s theorem becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .5.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

where @xmath @xmath @xmath and @xmath is the horizontal boundary region
described above.

The set @xmath is a vertical translation of a fundamental domain of the
action of @xmath on @xmath That is the @xmath coordinate projection is
constant and equal to @xmath Set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then @xmath is a fundamental domain for @xmath

With our notation the right side of equation ( \thechapter .5.1 )
becomes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In the terms above involving multiplications of lattice sums, after
integration over @xmath the only surviving terms are (by the
orthogonality of the family @xmath )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

A direct calculation using the fact that @xmath and @xmath satisfy the
Bessel equation ( \thechapter .3.1 ) shows that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

thus

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By definition @xmath and thus combing the integral of @xmath and @xmath
we obtain the lemma. ∎

Let @xmath be cofinite with cusps @xmath for @xmath with fundamental
domain @xmath For @xmath

Let @xmath be a Maaß  form, that is @xmath is smooth, satisfies @xmath
for some @xmath and for each cusp @xmath of @xmath and @xmath with
@xmath We define

(Maaß-Selberg Relations) Let @xmath be cofinite, @xmath @xmath and
@xmath be Maaß forms satisfying @xmath , @xmath with @xmath Suppose that
@xmath and @xmath Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

For notational simplicity we assume @xmath has only one class of cusps
at @xmath We can write @xmath (see § \thechapter .3.2 ).

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .5.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

The equality follows from the fact that @xmath is an orthogonal
projection. We will first show

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .5.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

Since @xmath has no constant Fourier expansion coefficients (see
Proposition \thechapter .3.4 ) @xmath and by Lemma \thechapter .3.1

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .5.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

for @xmath and as @xmath

Next to prove equation ( \thechapter .5.3 ) we apply the vector form of
Greene’s theorem,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and we obtain (by ( \thechapter .5.4 ))

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

To conclude the proof write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and apply Lemma ( \thechapter .5.1 ) to @xmath ∎

### \thechapter.6 The resolvent kernel

#### \thechapter.6.1 The definition of the resolvent

One of our main goals in this paper is to understand the spectrum of
@xmath The spectrum is best understood in terms of the resolvent
operator. The resolvent set of @xmath @xmath is the set of all @xmath so
that @xmath has a bounded inverse, defined on the entire Hilbert space
@xmath . The spectrum of @xmath @xmath is the complement of the
resolvent set @xmath For each @xmath we have the resolvent operator
@xmath

#### \thechapter.6.2 The resolvent kernel for @xmath

We will understand the resolvent operator through its kernel. A bounded
linear operator @xmath is said to have a kernel if there exists a
function @xmath so that for all @xmath @xmath Recall (from § \thechapter
.2 ) that for @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and for @xmath where @xmath is the hyperbolic distance function.

###### Definition \thechapter.6.1.

Let @xmath be a cofinite Kleinian group, @xmath and @xmath with @xmath
Define the Maaß-Selberg Series

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .6.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

Since @xmath converges uniformly when @xmath are restricted to compact
subsets of
@xmath (see [ EGM98 , page 96] ) and @xmath is a unitary representation
( @xmath has norm one for all @xmath ) the sum in equation ( \thechapter
.6.1 ) converges absolutely and uniformly when @xmath are restricted to
compact subsets of
@xmath

The function @xmath is the kernel for the resolvent operator of @xmath

###### Theorem \thechapter.6.2.

Let @xmath be cofinite with @xmath , and @xmath with @xmath Then @xmath
has kernel @xmath .

To prove the theorem one shows that for @xmath with @xmath any element
@xmath can be represented by a continuous function which satisfies

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .6.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

Equation ( \thechapter .6.2 ) can be seen by unfolding the integral in (
\thechapter .6.2 ) and applying Lemma \thechapter .2.1 . See [ EGM98 ,
theorem 4.2.6, page 150] for more details.

#### \thechapter.6.3 Fourier expansion of the resolvent kernel

In this section we will concern ourselves with a sub-sum of the
resolvent kernel that causes the resolvent kernel to not be of
Hilbert-Schmidt type. For notational simplicity we assume that @xmath is
cofinite with only one cusp at @xmath Fix a fundamental domain @xmath
and let @xmath

Recall that for @xmath the resolvent kernel can be expressed as a sum

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Let @xmath be the basis constructed in § \thechapter .3.2 . For
convenience we drop the @xmath subscript and consider @xmath and
corresponding orthogonal projections @xmath

The following lemmas are all proved using a standard separation of
variables technique. See [ Ven82 , Pages 20-23] and § \thechapter .3.1

###### Lemma \thechapter.6.3.

Let @xmath satisfy @xmath Then

     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and @xmath (See Proposition \thechapter .3.4 for an explanation of the
notation used).

#### \thechapter.6.4 Estimates of the resolvent kernel

It follows from [ EGM98 , Theorem 4.5.2] that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In other words, @xmath is a Hilbert-Schmidt kernel. On the other hand,
@xmath is not. However, from the Fourier series expansion of @xmath and
the decay properties of the Bessel functions @xmath it follows that the
only component of the resolvent kernel that destroys
square-integrability is,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Definition \thechapter.6.6.

Let @xmath be cofinite with one cusp at @xmath For @xmath decompose
@xmath and let @xmath define

### \thechapter.7 Analytic continuation of the Eisenstein Series

The meromorphic continuation of @xmath is necessary for the proof of the
spectral decomposition theorem, and is highly non-trivial. Fortunately,
there are several well-known methods available, [ Fad69 ] , [ Sel89 ] ,
[ Sel91 ] , [ CdV81 ] , and [ Lan76 ] . In [ EGM98 ] an adaptation of
the methods in [ CdV81 ] is used to prove the three-dimensional scalar
case, and a similar adaptation works ²⁰ ²⁰ 20 Alternatively, Faddeev’s
method can also be used to express the meromorphic continuation of
@xmath by adapting [ Ven82 , Chapters 2 and 3] . for the vector case
which we show now.

#### \thechapter.7.1 The idea of the proof

As in Faddeev’s proof the key idea is the resolvent kernel of @xmath We
know from § \thechapter .6 that it is not a Hilbert-Schmidt operator.
However the key step in the proof is to construct a self adjoint
operator @xmath defined on a closed subspace (the set of functions whose
constant Fourier term vanishes for @xmath ) so that @xmath is
Hilbert-Schmidt and is closely related to @xmath

#### \thechapter.7.2 Statement of the theorem

###### Theorem \thechapter.7.1.

Let @xmath be cofinite, @xmath and @xmath Then

(1) @xmath admits a meromorphic continuation in the following sense. For
each fixed @xmath , @xmath is a meromorphic function in @xmath . The
poles of @xmath depend only on @xmath and not on @xmath .

(2) If @xmath is open with @xmath regular on @xmath then @xmath is real
analytic on @xmath .

(3) For each regular @xmath , @xmath .

(4) The scattering matrix @xmath and @xmath are both finite ordered
meromorphic functions with order @xmath

(5) @xmath

(6) @xmath

(7) @xmath is a unitary matrix on the critical axis @xmath

#### \thechapter.7.3 Proof of theorem (\thechapter.7.1) part I:
Preliminaries

In order to avoid complicated notation (quadruple subscripts) we will
assume the following:

###### Assumption \thechapter.7.2.

The Kleinian group @xmath has only one class of cusps at @xmath and
@xmath

Then we can choose fundamental domain of the form @xmath (here @xmath
see § \thechapter .6 ). We can write the orthogonal projection onto
@xmath by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the orthogonal projection onto @xmath (see § \thechapter
.3.2 ).

Since we assume that @xmath is the only cusp we have (by definition)
@xmath distinct Eisenstein series ( @xmath ) which have an expansion of
the form (see § \thechapter .3.3 , § \thechapter .4.3 ).

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .7.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

We will need various spaces of functions. Let @xmath be the standard
(quotient map) projection, and set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We will restrict functions in @xmath to @xmath The space of
distributions @xmath is the set of all continuous (complex valued)
linear functionals on @xmath A function @xmath can be identified with
the distribution @xmath where

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .7.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

Noting that @xmath we say that a distribution @xmath if and only if
there exists @xmath so that equation ( \thechapter .7.2 ) holds for all
@xmath

For @xmath chosen in the decomposition @xmath define

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and @xmath the corresponding space of distributions (the space of
continuous, complex valued, linear functionals of @xmath ). For each
@xmath we associate the distribution

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For @xmath we define the following differential operators at each point
@xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --

Then

that satisfies

for all @xmath

for some @xmath If equation ( \thechapter .7.4 ) is satisfied, then

#### \thechapter.7.5 Proof of theorem (\thechapter.7.1) part III: The
meromorphic continuation

We exhibit the meromorphic continuation of the Eisenstein series to all
of @xmath

For @xmath with @xmath set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By Lemma \thechapter .7.4 and Lemma \thechapter .7.5 , @xmath varies
meromorphically. Next for each @xmath @xmath (since it is in the range
of the resolvent of @xmath ), and an appeal to Lemma \thechapter .7.4
give us

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .7.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

Plugging in (to the distributional equation above) arbitrary test
functions @xmath which do not vanish at the support of each @xmath into
equation ( \thechapter .7.5 ) shows that the functions @xmath are
meromorphic on all of @xmath (the remaining terms in equation (
\thechapter .7.5 ) are meromorphic).

Next define the following meromorphic functions,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Finally, let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then (in the distributional sense) @xmath and moreover, by the elliptic
regularity theorem @xmath is smooth as a function of @xmath

Since @xmath are meromorphic, and of order @xmath @xmath is meromorphic,

To relate @xmath to @xmath express @xmath as a linear combination of the
@xmath and apply the uniqueness part of Lemma \thechapter .7.5 .

We have proved parts (1)-(4) of Theorem \thechapter .7.1 . Part (5) can
be seen by plugging in @xmath into @xmath and applying the uniqueness
part of Lemma \thechapter .7.5 . Part(6) follows immediately from (5).
Part (7): from the Dirichlet series representation of the components of
@xmath we see that for @xmath

Observing that for @xmath @xmath and appealing to (6) proves (7).

### \thechapter.8 Proof of the spectral decomposition theorem

There are several proofs of the spectral decomposition theorem. All of
them use the analytic continuation of the Eisenstein series to the
critical line @xmath in a crucial manner.

One particularly nice approach is to use the general theory of
eigenpackets. This approach makes the deep connection between the
Eisenstein series and the spectral decomposition theorem quite clear. We
shall see that integral of the Eisenstein series on segments of the
critical line ( @xmath ) is an eigenpacket.

#### \thechapter.8.1 Statement of the theorem

Let @xmath be a cofinite group with @xmath

Let @xmath denote a countable indexing set of all @xmath (the domain of
@xmath ) such that @xmath for some @xmath .

We remark that in general, we do not know if @xmath is an infinite set.

###### Theorem \thechapter.8.1.

Let @xmath . Then @xmath has an expansion of the form

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .8.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

The sum and integrals converge pointwise absolutely and uniformly on
compact subsets of @xmath

#### \thechapter.8.2 Eigenpackets

Throughout this section, let @xmath be a self-adjoint operator with
domain @xmath in the Hilbert space @xmath with inner product @xmath

We will outline the spectral decomposition theorem for eigenpackets. See
[ EGM98 , Section 6.2] for more details.

An eigenpacket of @xmath is a map @xmath having the following
properties:

(1) @xmath and @xmath for all @xmath

(2) The map @xmath is continuous (in the norm sense).

(3) @xmath where the integral is the limit in the norm sense of the
corresponding Stieltjes sums. By an integration by parts, we can rewrite
(3) as @xmath where the integral is the limit of Riemann sums in the
norm sense.

Eigenpackets have many similarities to eigenfunctions. If @xmath is an
eigenvector of @xmath then @xmath for all @xmath In addition, if @xmath
is also an eigenpacket of @xmath and @xmath are two intervals having at
most one point in common, then

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .8.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

Fix an eigenpacket @xmath of @xmath Then there exists a non-decreasing
right continuous function @xmath which is unique up to an additive
constant satisfying the equation

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .8.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

for all @xmath

For @xmath define a function @xmath by

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .8.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

Next let @xmath be a partion of @xmath of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and define

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For a sequence of partitions (sub partitions) @xmath with maximal width
of its subdivsion converging to zero set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Further define

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We can now write down the general spectral decomposition theorem. Let
@xmath be a countable indexing set for a maximal set of orthonormal
eigenvectors @xmath and @xmath a countable indexing set for a maximal
set of orthogonal eigenpackets of @xmath .

###### Lemma \thechapter.8.2.

Let @xmath be a maximal set of orthonormal eigenvectors of @xmath and
@xmath be a maximal set of orthogonal eigenpackets of @xmath Then every
@xmath can be decomposed as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The sum and integrals converge in the norm sense in @xmath

#### \thechapter.8.3 Proof of the theorem

###### Lemma \thechapter.8.3.

Let @xmath be cofinite with @xmath For @xmath @xmath
@xmath we define

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with positive choice of square root. Then @xmath and the family of
@xmath are a maximal system of orthogonal eigenpackets for @xmath
Further,

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .8.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

for @xmath and @xmath

###### Proof.

For notational simplicity we work under Assumption \thechapter .7.2 .
From the Fourier expansion of the Eisenstein series we see that @xmath
as @xmath where @xmath , and @xmath is defined by @xmath Since @xmath is
unitary on the critical axis, @xmath for @xmath

We next show that @xmath for each @xmath Put @xmath and set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

An integration by parts shows that ²¹ ²¹ 21 The implicit constant
depends on @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Hence @xmath The upper bound on @xmath and the dominated convergence
theorem imply that @xmath is continuous in the norm sense.

Next, for @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The last equality was obtained by subsituting @xmath We have now shown
that @xmath is an eigenpacket.

We next prove the orthogonality relation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

using the Maaß-Selberg relations (Theorem \thechapter .5.2 ). We have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

since all three terms above are bounded for @xmath ( @xmath is a unitary
matrix so its terms are bounded and rows are orthonormal), and by the
Riemann-Lebesgue lemma.

Equation ( \thechapter .8.5 ) follows in a similar manner. Letting
@xmath , we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

See [ EGM98 , Pages 272-275] and [ Iwa02 , Page 97] for the details. The
trick is to add and subtract the conjugate to the second to last term
(on the left side of the equal sign) and combine one of the extra terms
with the last term.

Finally, it remains to prove completeness. Let @xmath and extend the
function

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

to @xmath Then one can verify that @xmath is orthogonal to the set of
cusp forms ²² ²² 22 The space of cusp forms is the space spanned by the
eigenvalues of @xmath that are in @xmath and whose constant term in
their Fourier expansion is identically zero. Only finitely many
eigenvalues of @xmath are not cusp forms. , and to all eigenpackets
@xmath for @xmath The function @xmath is not orthogonal to the
exceptional eigenfunctions (the residues of the Eisenstein series @xmath
at the poles @xmath ) and the eigenpacket @xmath Let @xmath denote the
orthogonal projection onto the space spanned by the exceptional
eigenfunctions and the the span of @xmath Then a computation shows that
@xmath that is our system eigenfunctions-eigenpacket system is complete
with respect to expanding @xmath Now suppose that there exists an
eigenpacket @xmath orthogonal to all of the @xmath and cusp forms, and
let @xmath be the span of @xmath Then for @xmath by the completeness
with respect to @xmath @xmath for @xmath that is @xmath is a cusp form,
a contradiction unless @xmath See [ EGM98 , Pages 274-276] for more
details. ∎

## Chapter \thechapter The Selberg Trace Formula

In this chapter we derive the Selberg Trace Formula for cofinite
Kleinian groups with finite dimensional unitary representations.

### \thechapter.1 The Selberg Trace Formula

###### Theorem \thechapter.1.1.

(Selberg Trace Formula) Let @xmath be a cofinite Kleinian group, @xmath
be a holomorphic function on @xmath for some @xmath satisfying @xmath as
@xmath and let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

Here, @xmath are the eigenvalues of @xmath counted with multiplicity.
Following [ EGM98 ] section 5.2, the summation with respect to @xmath
extends over the finitely many @xmath conjugacy classes of the non
cuspidal elliptic elements (elliptic elements that do not fix a cusp)
@xmath and for such a class @xmath is the minimal norm of a hyperbolic
or loxodromic element of the centralizer @xmath The element @xmath is
understood to be a @xmath th power of a primitive non cuspidal elliptic
element @xmath describing a hyperbolic rotation around the fixed axis of
@xmath with minimal rotation angle @xmath Further, @xmath is the maximal
finite subgroup contained in @xmath The summation with respect to @xmath
extends over the @xmath conjugacy classes of hyperbolic or loxodromic
elements of @xmath @xmath denotes a primitive hyperbolic or loxodromic
element associated with @xmath The element @xmath is conjugate in @xmath
to the transformation described by the diagonal matrix with diagonal
entries @xmath with @xmath and @xmath For @xmath @xmath is a @xmath
matrix-valued meromorphic function, called the scattering matrix of
@xmath and @xmath Furthermore @xmath and @xmath are constants depending
on @xmath which will be determined in the case of @xmath having only one
cusp at @xmath The remaining notation will be defined in this chapter ²³
²³ 23 Please note that there is a typographical error in the loxodromic
and non cuspidal elliptic terms in [ EGM98 ] Theorem 6.5.1; both terms
are missing a factor of @xmath
.

For @xmath set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It follows that @xmath , where @xmath denotes the hyperbolic distance in
@xmath Next, for @xmath a Schwartz-class function, define

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The series above converges absolutely and uniformly on compact subsets
of @xmath , and is the kernel of a bounded operator @xmath The Selberg
trace formula is essentially ²⁴ ²⁴ 24 We say “essentially” because
@xmath is not of trace class. Selberg’s procedure is used to define and
compute the regularized trace.
the trace of @xmath evaluated in two different ways: the first using
spectral theory, and the second as an explicit integral.

The function @xmath that appears in the Selberg trace formula is the
Selberg--Harish-Chandra transform ²⁵ ²⁵ 25 If @xmath is a smooth
function satisfying @xmath , then @xmath That is @xmath is an
eigenfunction of @xmath with an eigenvalue that depends only on @xmath
of @xmath defined as follows:

           ( \thechapter .1.2)
  -- -- -- ---------------------

#### \thechapter.1.1 Expansion of @xmath

We now diagonalize @xmath For @xmath define a map @xmath by

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

An immediate application of the spectral decomposition theorem and the
Selberg transform give us,

###### Lemma \thechapter.1.2.

Let @xmath and @xmath be the Selberg Transform of @xmath Then

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

The sum and integrals converge absolutely and uniformly on compact
subsets of @xmath .

Set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then clearly @xmath We have

###### Lemma \thechapter.1.3.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

The first equation follows from the decay properties of @xmath , the
orthonormality of the @xmath and that fact that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For the second, note that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

thus by the orthonormality of the @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By the decay properties of @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

∎

If we naively try to take the trace of @xmath by @xmath we would see
that the integral does not converge. However we can regularize the trace
by subtracting off the term @xmath in the following careful manner.

###### Lemma \thechapter.1.4.

Let @xmath Then @xmath is in @xmath Further,

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

(The set @xmath is defined in Lemma \thechapter .6.4 .) In particular,
the singularities arising from each integral must cancel out.

The fact that the singularities arising from each integral must cancel
out will be crucial in our derivation of the Selberg trace formula, and
imply some interesting group relations of @xmath

#### \thechapter.1.2 Proof of the Spectral Truncated Trace

For this section Assumption \thechapter .7.2 is in effect. So far we
know little about the @xmath dependence of the Eisenstein series on the
critical line. The following consequence of Lemma \thechapter .1.2 will
remedy the situation.

###### Lemma \thechapter.1.5.

Let @xmath Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

For @xmath let @xmath be a smooth function satisfying

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for some @xmath and for all @xmath (See [ EGM98 , page 292] for the
construction). Then it follows ( [ EGM98 , page 292] ) that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for all @xmath On the other hand we have (Lemma \thechapter .1.2 )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and by Parseval’s equality (for the Hilbert space @xmath ), setting
@xmath we obtain

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By [ EGM98 , page 122] we get

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which gives a positive lower bound on @xmath for @xmath The lemma now
follows. ∎

The following lemma will allow us to compute the spectral trace. More
specifically the Maaß-Selberg relations will give the leading terms of
the truncated trace while the error term (below) will vanish as @xmath
We adapt a nice argument found in [ Iwa02 , Page 142] which shortens the
exposition found in [ EGM98 , Page 295] .

###### Lemma \thechapter.1.6.

Let @xmath Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

Let @xmath and let @xmath be a fundamental domain for the lattice @xmath
By Parseval’s equality ²⁶ ²⁶ 26 @xmath is the Fourier coefficient of
@xmath
(for eigenfunctions of the euclidean Laplacian on @xmath )

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .1.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

We have the well known formula

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which implies (by an elementary argument) that for any @xmath constant
@xmath sufficiently large, and implied constant independent of @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .1.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

An application of Parseval’s equality, and ( \thechapter .1.7 ) gives

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

Hence, we infer from Lemma \thechapter .1.5 , and another application of
Parsavel’s equality (for eigenfunctions of the Euclidean Laplacian) that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The lemma follows from the bound on @xmath using an elementary
integration by parts argument. ∎

Define @xmath By Theorem \thechapter .7.1 @xmath is a meromorphic,
finite ordered function on @xmath , @xmath on @xmath and @xmath is
regular on @xmath Let @xmath and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then we have

###### Lemma \thechapter.1.7.

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .1.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

The integral converges absolutely.

###### Proof.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By Lemma \thechapter .1.6 the term on the last line tends to zero as
@xmath We evaluate the first term above with the Maaß-Selberg relations
on the critical line @xmath For @xmath and @xmath the column vector of
Eisenstein series ( @xmath ). Consider the @xmath matrix ²⁷ ²⁷ 27 Each
entry is the inner product of two truncated Eisenstein series. The inner
product takes place in the Hilbert space @xmath
, @xmath Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Applying the Maaß-Selberg relations @xmath many times and placing the
result in matrix form gives us ²⁸ ²⁸ 28 We are only interested in the
trace of the matrix @xmath However by working with the entire matrix we
can use the identity ( \thechapter .1.10 ) and derive a nice expression
for the trace.

and letting @xmath we obtain the lemma. See [ EGM98 , Page 305] and [

Let @xmath be real numbers which are both not integers and write @xmath
@xmath For @xmath set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath

Here the prime in the sum means to leave out zero. The series converges
uniformly and absolutely on compact subsets of @xmath Thus we can also
define

since the order of summation is not important when a sum converges
absolutely. In the sums, @xmath and @xmath are understood to vary over
the integers.

We have ( [ Sie80 ] or [ Lan87 , page 276] ²⁹ ²⁹ 29 There appears to be
a typographical error in the definition of the Siegel function on page
276 of the second edition of [ Lan87 ] . The correct definition appears
on page 262.
)

###### Lemma \thechapter.2.3.

The function @xmath can be continued to an entire function of @xmath and
one has

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

where @xmath is the Siegel function,

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

@xmath @xmath @xmath and @xmath

We now explain the relationship between @xmath and @xmath The character
@xmath is determined by @xmath and @xmath That is @xmath and @xmath can
be chosen so that @xmath We now can rewrite

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

Here the prime means we leave off zero from the sum.

Formally, ignoring convergence and order of summation,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In the next section we will make the above argument rigorous.

#### \thechapter.2.3 Evaluation of @xmath

###### Proposition \thechapter.2.4.

Let @xmath be a lattice with @xmath a character of @xmath and @xmath are
both not integers satisfying @xmath @xmath Then

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

###### Proof.

For @xmath recall that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For @xmath set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By proposition ( \thechapter .2.2 ) @xmath converges, and by equation (
\thechapter .2.4 ) @xmath By Lemma \thechapter .2.3 @xmath can be
continued to an entire function (also denoted by @xmath ). In particular
@xmath is continuous and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By definition, @xmath for @xmath If we can show that @xmath is
continuous on @xmath then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The function @xmath is a continuous function on @xmath by Lemma
\thechapter .2.5 . To see this observe that by the Cauchy criterion the
sum @xmath converges uniformly for @xmath Since a uniformly convergent
sum of continuous functions is continuous, the proposition is proved. ∎

#### \thechapter.2.4 Proof of lemma (\thechapter.2.5)

###### Lemma \thechapter.2.5.

For @xmath and @xmath both not integers, @xmath , @xmath let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

uniformly for @xmath

The implied constant does not depend on @xmath or @xmath Our proof will
work for @xmath However the interval @xmath is sufficient for our
application.

###### Proof.

Without loss of generality we assume @xmath and @xmath We estimate the
sum

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

Sum ( \thechapter .2.6 ) is a sum over lattice points of @xmath that are
outside of the circle of radius @xmath but inside the circle of radius
@xmath It suffices to restrict our sum to the first quadrant of the
plane since the sum over the other three quadrants can be estimated
similarly. With this assumption @xmath and @xmath and our sum can be
written as an explicit double sum with @xmath and @xmath separated as,

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

where @xmath The brackets, @xmath represent the greatest integer
function. The sum above is split over @xmath . For in the first case
horizontal translations of lattice points will intersect the inner
circle @xmath and hence @xmath must be restricted while the second sum
@xmath is free to start at zero. See figure ( \thechapter .2.1 ). We
encourage the reader to write down the explicit double sum in the simple
case of @xmath

We estimate the inner sum using a Stieltjes integral. For @xmath let
@xmath Then for @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath for any @xmath sufficiently small (the Stieltjes integral
must have a slightly larger integration domain to include the endpoints
of the sum). Next using integration by parts with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and noting that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

satisfies @xmath since @xmath is not an integer, we can estimate the
integral

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Note that @xmath is easily estimated since @xmath is monotone decreasing
and that the primes can be dropped since @xmath can be made arbitrarily
small.

What remains is to apply the above estimate to each of the inner sums
and crudely put absolute values around all the other terms.

The first sum can be estimated as follows,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Simplifying @xmath and @xmath using

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

yields

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The last inequality follows from @xmath

We apply the same method to the second sum and obtain,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It remains to show that both sums above are bounded by a term of growth
@xmath

For the right hand sum,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

since @xmath

For the left hand sum

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for some @xmath The last equality holds uniformly for @xmath by the
integral test. ∎

### \thechapter.3 The Explicit Trace

In this section our main goal is to give an explicit formula for

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Following Selberg’s original method we decompose

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

into various sub-sums. Depending on their type. The types are as
follows, ‘‘id’’ is the identity, ‘‘par’’ are the parabolic elements,
‘‘ce’’ are the cuspidal elliptic elements ³⁰ ³⁰ 30 These elliptical
elements share a common fixed point in @xmath with some parabolic
element in @xmath
, “nce” are the non-cuspidal elliptical elements, “lox” are the
hyperbolic and loxodromic elements, and “cusp” @xmath “par” @xmath “ce”.
For each @xmath set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Here @xmath denotes the subset of @xmath consisting of elements of type
@xmath

Following [ EGM98 , Section 5.2, Theorem 6.5.1] we have,

###### Lemma \thechapter.3.1.

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

The notations above were defined in § \thechapter .1 .

### The Cuspidal Elliptic Elements

Our next immediate goal is to evaluate

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For notational simplicity, we will adopt Assumption \thechapter .7.2
from this point on until the end of this thesis.

Denote by @xmath set of elements of @xmath which are @xmath -conjugate
to an element of @xmath We fix representatives of conjugacy classes of
@xmath ³¹ ³¹ 31 There are only finitely many distinct conjugacy classes
of elliptic elements in a cofinite Kleinian group. that have the form

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

For @xmath let @xmath denote the centralizer in @xmath of @xmath In
addition, let @xmath be the set of fixed points in @xmath of the element
@xmath Since @xmath is a cuspidal elliptic element it follows that
@xmath is a cusp of @xmath (see [ EGM98 ] page 52). Hence by Assumption
\thechapter .7.2 there is an element @xmath with @xmath Suppose that
@xmath is the lower left hand (matrix) entry of @xmath Then we have (see
[ EGM98 , Pages 302-304] ),

###### Lemma \thechapter.3.2.

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

### \thechapter.4 The Parabolic Elements

This section contains the new features of the Selberg trace formula that
are not present in the two-dimensional vector and three-dimensional
scalar cases. We remind the reader that Assumption \thechapter .7.2 is
in effect.

Our main goal for this section is to evaluate

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .4.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

### Evaluation of Integral \thechapter.4.1

Let @xmath be a fundamental domain for the action ³² ³² 32 See §
\thechapter .5 for more details on the action. of @xmath on @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It follows that @xmath is a fundamental domain for the action of @xmath
on @xmath .

Recall that @xmath is canonically isomorphic to a lattice @xmath For
@xmath let @xmath denote the corresponding parabolic element in @xmath
We will need the following (see [ EGM98 , Pages 300-301] )

###### Lemma \thechapter.4.1.

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .4.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

Since @xmath is an abelian group, @xmath restricted to @xmath can be
diagonalized. In other words, there exist lattice characters @xmath so
that

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .4.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

Thus it suffices to consider lattice characters instead of unitary
representations.

###### Lemma \thechapter.4.2.

Let @xmath be a lattice character of @xmath Then

(1) For @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

(2) For @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

(1) is proved in [ EGM98 , pages 300-302] .

The proof of (2) is a modification of (1). Let @xmath then by the
definition of the action of @xmath on @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .4.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

Since

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

using summation by parts, we can rewrite ( \thechapter .4.4 ) as

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .4.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

Next we apply Proposition \thechapter .2.2 to obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .4.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

Now we show that the resulting error term is @xmath Since @xmath (
@xmath is a rapid decay function)

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for some @xmath To complete the proof note that @xmath ∎

Finally we can evaluate ( \thechapter .4.1 ):

###### Lemma \thechapter.4.3.

  -- -- -- ---------------------
           ( \thechapter .4.7)
  -- -- -- ---------------------

Here @xmath @xmath are the lattice characters associated to the lattice
@xmath @xmath and @xmath is the analogue of the Euler constant for the
lattice @xmath

###### Proof.

The proof follows immediately from Lemma \thechapter .4.1 , Equation
\thechapter .4.3 , and Lemma \thechapter .4.2 . ∎

We have evaluated the truncated trace of @xmath explicitly as an
integral, and by using spectral theory. Notice that as @xmath the
integral over the parabolic sum (Lemma \thechapter .4.3 ) has a
divergent term. So does the corresponding cuspidal elliptic integral
(Lemma \thechapter .3.2 ). By Lemma \thechapter .1.4 the divergent terms
must equal the divergent term of the spectral (truncated) trace (Lemma
\thechapter .1.7 ). It follows that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By choosing a suitable @xmath so that @xmath we obtain

###### Lemma \thechapter.4.4.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The formula ³³ ³³ 33 A similar formula is valid for the general case of
@xmath -many cusps.
above is an application of spectral theory to the group relations of a
cofinite hyperbolic three-orbifold ³⁴ ³⁴ 34 Notice that all of the terms
above are defined simply in terms of group relations. . We will use the
above lemma to give a meromorphic continuation of the Selberg
zeta-function.

### Completion of the proof of the Selberg Trace Formula

The Selberg trace formula now follows: combine Lemma \thechapter .4.3 ,
Lemma \thechapter .3.2 , Lemma \thechapter .4.4 , Lemma \thechapter .3.1
, Lemma \thechapter .1.7 , and Lemma \thechapter .1.4 . Note that the
divergent terms all cancel by Lemma \thechapter .1.4 (or we can use
Lemma \thechapter .4.4 ). Finally take the limit as @xmath See [ EGM98 ,
Section 6.5] for more details on combining the lemmas above.

## Chapter \thechapter The Selberg Zeta Function

In this section we define the Selberg zeta-function @xmath for cofinite
Kleinian groups with finite-dimensional unitary representations, in the
right half-plane @xmath We then evaluate the logarithmic derivative of
@xmath and show that @xmath admits a meromorphic continuation, subject
to some technical assumptions concerning the stabilizer subgroup @xmath

### \thechapter.1 The Definition and Motivation

In the celebrated paper [ Sel56 ] Selberg first defined what is now
called ‘‘The Selberg zeta-function ³⁵ ³⁵ 35 More precisely, the Selberg
zeta-function of a cocompact Fuchsian group.
” as an infinite product over lengths of primitive closed geodesics ³⁶
³⁶ 36 Geodesics that do not trace over themselves multiple times.
, bearing a strong resemblance to the Riemann zeta-function.
Surprisingly, the Selberg zeta-function satisfies a Riemann hypothosis,
and encodes both geometric and spectral data of the quotient orbifold ³⁷
³⁷ 37 A Riemann surface if @xmath is torsion-free.
@xmath The spectral and geometric connection is made clear when one
understands the Selberg zeta-function as a by-product of the Selberg
trace formula applied to the resolvent kernel of @xmath

In Defintion \thechapter .1.1 we will define the Selberg zeta-function
for our case of interest. A natural question arises: what does our
zeta-function have in common with the original Selberg zeta-function?
The answer ³⁸ ³⁸ 38 An alternative answer is that in the cocompact case,
both zeta functions are factors of the regularized (functional)
determenant @xmath See [ Sar87 ] for more details.
: the logarithmic derivatives of both zeta-functions are directly
related to the loxodromic (or hyperbolic) contribution of the Selberg
trace formula applied to the resolvent kernel of @xmath The term (from
the trace formula) in question for our case has the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We show in Lemma \thechapter .1.2 that the term above is the logarithmic
derivatives of a meromorphic function @xmath and that it has a product
expansion in the right half-plane @xmath

In order to define @xmath we will need some notions concerning
centralizer subgroups of loxodromic elements. For more details see [
EGM98 , Sections 5.2,5.4] .

Let @xmath be a cofinite Kleinian group and let @xmath Suppose @xmath is
loxodromic (we consider hyperbolic elements as loxodromic elements).
Then @xmath is conjugate in @xmath to a unique element of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

such that @xmath has @xmath . Let @xmath denote the norm of @xmath
defined by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and let by @xmath denote the centralizer of @xmath in @xmath There
exists a (primitive) loxodromic element @xmath and a finite cyclic
elliptic subgroup @xmath of order @xmath generated by an element @xmath
such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Here @xmath ³⁹ ³⁹ 39 Note that by definition @xmath and that @xmath is
unique up to multiplication by an element of @xmath
Next, Let @xmath and @xmath denote the eigenvalues of @xmath and @xmath
respectively. The elliptic element @xmath is conjugate in @xmath to an
element of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where here @xmath is a primitive @xmath -th root of unity.

###### Definition \thechapter.1.1.

For @xmath the Selberg zeta-function @xmath is defined by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Here the product with respect to @xmath extends over a maximal reduced
system @xmath of @xmath -conjugacy classes of primitive loxodromic
elements of @xmath The system @xmath is called reduced if no two of its
elements have representatives with the same centralizer ⁴⁰ ⁴⁰ 40 See [
EGM98 ] section 5.4 for more details
. The function @xmath is defined by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Lemma \thechapter.1.2.

For @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

It follows from the proof of [ EGM98 , Lemma 5.4.2] that

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

Next since @xmath commutes with @xmath we can diagonalize the
restriction of @xmath to @xmath and continue the equality to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Next we sum over the @xmath index (note that it is a geometric sum of an
@xmath th root of unity) observe that the sum is non-zero only when

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

or using our notation @xmath The equality continues as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

∎

### \thechapter.2 The Logarithmic Derivative of the Selberg
Zeta-Function

The first step in obtaining the meromorphic continuation of the
zeta-function is to relate its logarithmic derivative to the trace
formula. From this point on Assumption \thechapter .7.2 is in effect.

We apply the Selberg trace formula to the pair of functions,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath and obtain

###### Lemma \thechapter.2.1.

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

###### Proof.

The first equality follows from Lemma \thechapter .1.2 . The second
equality follows directly from the Selberg trace formula. ∎

Equation ( \thechapter .2.1 ) is used to exhibit the meromorphic
continuation of @xmath If we fix @xmath and multiply through by @xmath
it is not hard to see that each term on the right of ( \thechapter .2.1
) is meromorphic. In order to see that @xmath is meromorphic, we must
compute the residues of each term on the right of ( \thechapter .2.1 ).
We will show that the residues are fractional and that for some @xmath
is a meromorphic function.

###### Theorem \thechapter.2.2.

Let @xmath be cofinite with one class of cusps at @xmath and let @xmath

1.   If @xmath or @xmath then @xmath is a meromorphic function.

2.   If @xmath then there exists a natural number @xmath @xmath so that
    @xmath is a meromorphic function.

###### Proof.

The proof follows from a careful study of ( \thechapter .2.1 ). We must
show that after multiplying by @xmath each term on the right (of the
second equal sign) has at most simple poles with integral or rational
residues ⁴¹ ⁴¹ 41 For case (1) the residues must be integer while for
case (2) it suffices to show that the residues are rational with bounded
denominator.
. This is demonstrated in Lemma \thechapter .2.4 , Lemma \thechapter
.3.1 , Lemma \thechapter .3.2 , and Lemma \thechapter .3.4 . ∎

We remark that the divisor of the Selberg zeta-function is readily read
off from Lemma \thechapter .2.4 , Lemma \thechapter .3.1 , Lemma
\thechapter .3.2 , and Lemma \thechapter .3.4 .

Our zeta function satisfies a functional equation. A standard argument (
[ Ven82 , Theorem 5.1.5, page 85] ) using ( \thechapter .2.1 ), Lemma
\thechapter .2.4 , Lemma \thechapter .3.1 , Lemma \thechapter .3.2 , and
Lemma \thechapter .3.4 yields:

###### Theorem \thechapter.2.3.

Suppose that @xmath or @xmath Then @xmath satisfies:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The constant ⁴² ⁴² 42 The value of @xmath can be read off by letting
@xmath in the functional equations. Its value depends on whether @xmath
is @xmath or @xmath and the multiplicity of @xmath at @xmath
@xmath satisfies the equation: @xmath

###### Lemma \thechapter.2.4.

The expression

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

has only simple poles and integral residues:

(a) at the points @xmath on the line @xmath and on the interval @xmath
Each point @xmath is related to an eigenvalue @xmath of the discrete
spectrum of @xmath by @xmath The residue of each @xmath is equal to the
multiplicity of the corresponding eigenvalue. If @xmath is an eigenvalue
of @xmath then the residue of the point @xmath is twice the multiplicity
of @xmath

(b) at the points @xmath that are poles of @xmath which lie in the
half-plane @xmath The residue of each @xmath is non-negative ⁴³ ⁴³ 43
The point @xmath is a zero of @xmath and a pole of @xmath We understand
the multiplicity of a pole as non-negative number (not as a negative
number).
and equal to its multiplicity as a pole of @xmath

###### Proof.

The computation involves elementary complex analysis. See [ Ven82 ,
Section 5.1] . ∎

The residues above come from terms that are related to the spectral and
scattering theory of @xmath The remaining residues are computed using
group theoretic data involving @xmath and @xmath The poles and zeros of
@xmath that correspond to these residues are commonly called topological
or trivial ⁴⁴ ⁴⁴ 44 We refer to them as topological.
.

### \thechapter.3 The Topological Zeros and Poles

The computation of the topological residues is considerably more
complicated than the corresponding spectral computation. Poles can only
arise from the following terms (excluding the spectral terms previously
dealt with) of ( \thechapter .2.1 ) (note that we multiplied all terms
through by @xmath ):

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

The first two terms come from the parabolic elements of @xmath , the
third from the spectral trace, and the last from the cuspidal elliptic
elements of @xmath It is remarkable that the last three terms need to be
taken together in order to compute the residue at @xmath while the first
and last are needed to compute the residues on the negative real axis.

It is well known that

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

In order to obtain a similarly explicit formula for

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

we must make some technical assumptions.

#### \thechapter.3.1 Case One: @xmath

In this case, ( \thechapter .3.3 ) is not applicable and @xmath (the
last equality follows from our assumption that @xmath is the only cusp).
Since @xmath is a unitary self-adjoint matrix of dimension @xmath , its
trace consists of a sum of @xmath terms of the form @xmath It follows
that @xmath is an integer. After applying equations ( \thechapter .3.1 )
and ( \thechapter .3.2 ) we have:

###### Lemma \thechapter.3.1.

Suppose @xmath Then the poles of ( \thechapter .3.1 ) are simple and are
located at the points @xmath with residue @xmath and at the point @xmath
with residue @xmath

#### \thechapter.3.2 Case Two: @xmath

In this case for all @xmath and ( \thechapter .3.3 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .3.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

An application of Lemma \thechapter .4.4 gives us the coefficient of the
integral above

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Next, to evaluate the integral in ( \thechapter .3.4 ) we appeal to the
following formula:

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .3.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

valid for @xmath and @xmath (see [ GR65 ] formula 3.543.2). Averaging
for the two values @xmath we obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .3.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

Finally, we can evaluate the integral in ( \thechapter .3.4 ) by taking
the limit as @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .3.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

Combining the residues above with those from ( \thechapter .3.2 ) give
us:

###### Lemma \thechapter.3.2.

Suppose @xmath Then the poles of ( \thechapter .3.1 ) are simple and are
located at the points @xmath with @xmath and residue ⁴⁵ ⁴⁵ 45 Note that
by defintion @xmath
:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and at the point @xmath with residue @xmath

Since the Picard group @xmath satisfies @xmath we have:

###### Corollary \thechapter.3.3.

Let @xmath and let @xmath Then @xmath is a meromorphic function.

#### \thechapter.3.3 Case Three: @xmath

In this case, the cuspidal elliptic elements @xmath that are in (
\thechapter .3.3 ) must all be of order three. Hence @xmath but when
such @xmath is plugged into @xmath one obtains @xmath Thus we can
rewrite ( \thechapter .3.3 ) as

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .3.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

Next, applying ( \thechapter .3.6 ) with @xmath and Lemma \thechapter
.4.4 , we can rewrite ( \thechapter .3.8 ) as

  -- -------- -- ---------------------
     @xmath      ( \thechapter .3.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------------------

Finally combining the residues above with the residues from (
\thechapter .3.2 ) we obtain:

###### Lemma \thechapter.3.4.

Suppose @xmath Then the poles of ( \thechapter .3.1 ) are simple and are
located at the points @xmath with @xmath and residue:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and at the point @xmath with residue @xmath

As an application of the lemma above, we have:

###### Corollary \thechapter.3.5.

Let @xmath and @xmath (the trivial representation). Then @xmath is not a
meromorphic function ⁴⁶ ⁴⁶ 46 This is the first example that the author
is aware of where the Selberg zeta-function is not meromorphic.
(it is the 6-th root of a meromorphic function).

###### Proof.

Since @xmath has class number one, @xmath has one class of cusps ( [
EGM98 , Chapter 7] ). In addition it has @xmath for a cusp. Elementary
calculations show that @xmath By definition, @xmath implies that @xmath
The result follows from Lemma \thechapter .3.4 . ∎

#### \thechapter.3.4 The Remaining Cases

The cases that remain are: @xmath and @xmath Using the same ideas as in
the other three cases one can show the following:

###### Theorem \thechapter.3.6.

Suppose that @xmath Then for some integer @xmath @xmath is a meromorphic
function.

The author does not know a good bound for the integer @xmath ( @xmath
depends on @xmath and @xmath On the other hand we conjecture the
following:

###### Conjecture.

Suppose that @xmath Then for some integer @xmath @xmath is a meromorphic
function.

### \thechapter.4 The Entire Function Associated to the Selberg
Zeta-Function

As Fischer [ Fis87 , Chapter 3] observed, it is useful to group the
elliptic, parabolic, and identity terms, together with the loxodromic
terms to define an entire function associated to the Selberg
zeta-function called the Selberg xi-function @xmath

###### Definition \thechapter.4.1.

For @xmath set ⁴⁷ ⁴⁷ 47 Theorem \thechapter .4.2 shows that we are
justified in defining @xmath by its logarithmic derivative.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is defined in Theorem \thechapter .2.3 .

###### Theorem \thechapter.4.2.

The Selberg xi-function can be continued to an entire function @xmath
with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Here @xmath , @xmath

###### Proof.

The second assertion follows from ( \thechapter .2.1 ). For the first
asserstion: by Lemma \thechapter .2.4 , after multiplying through by
@xmath the residues of the expression on the right side of the equal
sign are all integers and positive. Hence @xmath is entire. ∎

An explicit product formula (for @xmath ) can be obtained for @xmath in
the case of @xmath by integrating, and then exponentiating, the explicit
formula for the contribution of the parabolic and cuspidal elliptic
elements to the Selberg zeta-function.

###### Remark \thechapter.4.3.

The Selberg zeta-function for symmetric spaces of rank-one was studied
by Gangolli and Warner ( [ Gan77 ] , [ GW80 ] ). More specifically, they
studied torsion-free cocompact quotients with finite-dimensional unitary
representations, and non-cocompact torsion-free quotients with trivial
representations (the scalar case).
