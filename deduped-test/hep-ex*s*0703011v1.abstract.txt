We present results of a search for for the anomalous production of events
containing a high-transverse momentum charged lepton (electron or muon) and
photon, accompanied by missing transverse energy (MET), and/or additional
leptons and photons, and jets (X). We use the same kinematic selection criteria
as in a previous CDF search, but with a substantially larger data set, 305pb-1,
a ppbar collision energy of 1.96 TeV, and the upgraded CDF II detector. We find
42 Lepton + Photon + MET events versus a standard model expectation of 37.3 +-
5.4 events. The level of excess observed in Run I, 16 events with an
expectation of 7.6 +- 0.7 events (corresponding to a 2.7 sigma effect), is not
supported by the new data. In the signature of Multi-Lepton + Photon we observe
31 events versus an expectation of 23.0 +- 2.7 events. In this sample we find
no events with an extra photon or MET and so find no events like the one 'two
electrons + two photons + MET' ('eeggmet') event observed in Run I.
