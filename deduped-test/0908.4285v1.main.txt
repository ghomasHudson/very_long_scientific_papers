## Chapter 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Overview

Gas content, masses, bar structure, and dynamical environment can
strongly influence the large-scale star formation rate (SFR) along the
Hubble sequence [ 1998ARA&A..36..189K ] . The variation of young stellar
content and star formation activity is one of the most conspicuous
characteristic along this sequence, and this variation in the young
stellar population is part of the basis of the morphological
classification made by \citetex 1926ApJ….64..321H. The trend in SFRs and
star formation histories along the Hubble sequence was confirmed from
evolutionary synthesis models of galaxy colours by \citetex
1968ApJ…151..547T,1972A&A….20..383T and \citetex 1973ApJ…179..427S.
Later, the importance of the star formation bursting mode in the
evolution of low-mass galaxies and interacting systems was studied by
\citetex 1976PhDT………6B,1977ApJ…217..928H and \citetex 1978ApJ…219…46L.

Due to their different average SFR, the integrated spectra of galaxies
vary considerably along the Hubble sequence. In Figure 1.1 we show a
comparison of the integrated spectra of one elliptical (E4), two spirals
(Sa and Sc) and one Magellanic irregular galaxy from \citetex
1992ApJS…79..255K. In these examples one can easily appreciate that they
are broadly different. From ellipticals to irregulars, as SFR increases,
there is a rise in the blue continuum, a gradual change in the dominant
stellar composite spectrum in absorption (from K-giant to A-stars), and
a dramatical increase in the strengths of the nebular emission lines [
1998ARA&A..36..189K ] .

The main trends in SFRs and star formation histories along the Hubble
sequence can be delineated from measurements of the integrated SFRs in
hundreds of nearby galaxies [ 1998ARA&A..36..189K ] . Large-scale star
formation processes occur in two very different environments, in the
extended discs of spiral and irregular galaxies and in compact, dense
gas discs in the center of galaxies. The total star formation in the
local universe has a very important contribution from these two
mechanisms of stellar formation, which are traced at different
wavelengths and follow completely different patterns along the Hubble
sequence [ 1998ARA&A..36..189K ] .

#### 1.1.1 Gas ionization, metallicity and massive star formation

The star formation processes depend strongly on the physical conditions
of the media in which they take place. Among these conditions, the most
important are the density of the molecular and gaseous material, its
spatial distribution and its metallicity, conditions that restrict the
effectiveness and the star formation rate, as well as its initial mass
function. In particular, the metallicity is a key parameter that
controls many aspects in the formation and evolution of stars and
galaxies.

There are many processes that control the metallicity in a galaxy or a
gaseous nebula, such as the galaxy formation and evolution, massive star
formation, stellar winds, chemical yields, outflows and inflows, etc [
2000A&ARv..10....1K ] .

Due to the nature of the galaxies (except for the nearest systems)
almost all the information about their star formation properties is
collected from integrated light measurements of the ultraviolet
continuum, far-infrared and nebular emission recombination lines [
1998ARA&A..36..189K ] . In particular, the study of the gas ionized by
the most massive stars can provide information about their masses,
temperatures and evolutionary state. This in itself requires the use of
photo-ionization, stellar atmosphere and stellar evolution models. The
subsequent link between the massive star properties and those of the
global star formation needs also the use of evolutionary synthesis
models.

Photoionized gas shows a characteristic emission line spectrum and, in
principle, the spectra of H ii galaxies, galactic H ii regions, giant
extragalactic H ii regions (GEHRs), circumnuclear and even nuclear
regions, can be analyzed in the same way. The emission line intensities
are controlled by: the energy distribution of the ionizing photons, the
spatial configuration of the ionized gas and its local properties,
essentially its density and metal content. In fact, this last parameter
conforms the appearance of the emission line spectra to such an extent
that it imposes the methodology required for its analysis.

Figure 1.2 shows typical spectra of two H ii regions of widely different
metallicities. The low metallicity one (upper panel), corresponding to
knot A of NGC 2363 [ 1994ApJ...437..239G ] , shows very strong [O ii ],
[O iii ] lines, the Balmer and Paschen series are clearly visible and
the weak auroral lines of [O ii ] and [S ii ] are detectable and
measurable. This makes possible the application of what is called “the
direct method” for abundance determination (see for example \citeplain
1992MNRAS.255..325P). The high metallicity spectrum (lower panel),
corresponding to an H ii region (GA4) in the spiral disc of NGC 4258
(Díaz et al., 2000), looks very different. The high oxygen content
provides a very efficient cooling of the region and therefore the
emission lines are, in general, weaker. No intrinsically weak lines are
detected and the “direct method” is not applicable.

The application of these different methodologies to the optical
spectroscopic data through the years, which constitutes our main body of
information about global star formation in galaxies, has produced a
strongly biased view. Due both to selection effects and analysis
requirements, most of the objects observed and analyzed are those that
show oxygen emission lines near to their maximum intensity, which itself
corresponds to a narrow range of abundances.

One of the main aims of this work is to enlarge our view by first
obtaining a high quality set of data for low metallicity objects that
allows to refine the “direct method” for abundance determination
increasing its accuracy, and second obtaining a set of data on the
highest abundance objects to allow the definition of an appropriate
scheme for abundance determinations for these objects. Once this is
made, the interpretation of the observed emission line spectra in terms
of the properties of star formation can be made.

H ii galaxies and circumnuclear star-forming regions (CNSFRs) constitute
two obvious samples to serve our purposes since they represent two
extreme classes in metal content. H ii galaxies are among the lowest
metallicity objects known, whereas CNSFRs have high metallicities,
between solar and twice solar, as estimated from empirical calibrators
(see for example \citeplain 1991A&AS…91..285T and \citeplain
1998ApJ…498..541K).

An interesting point in the comparison of the physical properties and
the ionizing stellar populations of these two kinds of objects is their
H @xmath luminosity distribution. In Figure 1.3 we show the histograms
that represent these distributions for H ii galaxies [
2006MNRAS.365..454H ] and CNSFRs [ tesismar ] in the upper and lower
panels respectively. The H ii galaxies are further split into those with
a measurable [O iii ] @xmath 4363 Å auroral emission line (solid line)
and those without (dashed line). We can see that the distributions
differ and that the study of the star formation properties of only the
first of them would already provide a biased view.

In relation to the CNSFRs, the distribution of the H ii galaxies peaks
at greater values of the H @xmath luminosity and the width of the
distribution in order of magnitude is also larger. Yet, there is a
rather significant overlap which imply that, if the SFR is derived from
the H @xmath luminosities [ 1989ApJ...344..685K ] , CNSFRs can form as
many stars per year (the equivalent in M @xmath yr @xmath ) as some H ii
galaxies.

In what follows we describe some of the general properties of these
objects which are relevant to our study.

#### 1.1.2 Hii Galaxies: Star Formation in low metallicity environments
\citetex

1972ApJ…173…25S reported the discovery of two extragalactic objects with
very low metal abundances: IZw18 and IIZw40, two very well studied
galaxies at present. They pointed out that these galaxies should be
either young, in the sense that most of their star formation has
occurred in recent times, or that the star formation in them should have
occured in intense bursts which are separated by long quiescent periods,
since their derived abundances are one order of magnitude lower than the
solar value.

In Figure 1.4 we show a false colour image of IZw18 [
1966ApJ...143..192Z ] . It was once thought to be one of the youngest
galaxies since its bright stars indicated an age of only 500 million
years. The galaxy was also intriguing because it resembled galaxies
forming in the very early universe although it is a nearby object (14.6
@xmath 1.0 Mpc; \citeplain 2000ApJ…529..786Mtot) and is surrounded by
galaxies that are significantly older. Relatively recent images of IZw18
by the HST have helped resolve this mystery, by discovering a population
of old faint stars intertwined with the bright star population.
Therefore, IZw18 is now thought to be just as old as its neighbours,
roughly 10 @xmath years old, but with an intense episode of relatively
new star formation [ 1999AJ....118..302A ] . As was pointed out by
Aloisi et al., the trigger for this recent episode of bright star
formation is possibly the changing gravitational influence of the
smaller companion galaxy of IZw18, visible at the upper right in the
Figure.

IZw18 and IIZw40 are nowadays ascribed to the category of H ii galaxies.
H ii galaxies are a subclass of Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies (BCDs) which
show spectra with strong emission lines similar to those of GEHRs (
\citeplain 1970ApJ…162L.155S,1980ApJ…240…41F), have the lowest metal
content of any star forming galaxy known, suggesting that they are among
the youngest or less evolved galaxies [ 2007ApJ...654..226R ,
1972ApJ...173...25S ] .

In general, BCDs are characterized by their compact aspect, very low
metallicities, gas richness and blue colors [ 2000A&ARv..10....1K ] . In
Figure 1.5 we show the oxygen abundance distribution of a sample of H ii
galaxies in the local Universe with measurements of the [O iii ] @xmath
4363 Å auroral emission line from \citetex 2006MNRAS.365..454H.
Although, as mentioned above, these properties have made of them good
candidates to host their first episodes of star formation, recently the
detection in most of them of low surface-brightness elliptical haloes,
or the presence of stars belonging to older populations, have caused
this interpretation to be reconsidered. Nowadays, only a few candidates
remain controversial. There are several works in the literature whose
main aim is to study the weight of these older stellar populations in
BCDs and, hence, to find out the actual age and evolutionary status of
these objects. Among these studies, in the sample of local objects,
observations with enough spatial resolution to provide photometry of the
individual stars have allowed, by means of colour-magnitude diagrams, to
date some of the bursts (e.g. VII Zw403 by \citeplain 1998ApJ…493L..23S;
I Zw18 by \citeplain 1999AJ….118..302A, see Figure 1.6 ). In all these
works evidence for a stellar population older than 500 Myr has been
found. Besides, old stellar low-surface brightness components have been
detected in these local objects by studying the radial light
distribution in the optical (e.g. \citeplain 2003ApJS..147…29G) and the
near infrared (e.g. \citeplain 2005A&A…429..115N).

After the findings that a considerable number of the objects observed at
intermediate and high redshifts seem to have properties similar to the H
ii galaxies we know in the Local Universe, it has been suggested that
these objects might have been very common in the past and some of them
may have evolved to other kind of objects [ 1995ApJ...440L..49K ] .

#### 1.1.3 Circumnuclear Regions: Star Formation in high metallicity
environments

The gas flows in disc of spiral galaxies can be strongly perturbed by
the presence of bars, although the total disc SFR does not appear to be
significantly affected by them [ 1998ARA&A..36..189K ] . These
perturbations of the gas flow trigger nuclear star formation in the
bulges of some barred spiral galaxies. There is only a modest effect of
the spiral arm structure on the global SFR of spiral galaxies [
1986ApJ...311..554E , 1986ApJ...311..548M , 1990ApJ...349..497C ,
1992ApJ...385L..37K ] . Grand-design spiral galaxies (those that have
strong two-armed spiral patterns) show strong local enhancements of star
formation in their arms, without a corresponding excess in their total
SFRs. This suggests that the primary effect of the spiral density wave
is to concentrate star formation in the arms, but not to increase the
global efficiency [ 1998ARA&A..36..189K ] .

External environmental influences however, can have much stronger
effects on the SFR, among them, the most important by far, are tidal
interactions. There are several studies of these interactions, in
particular on the global H @xmath and far-IR emission of these
interacting and merging systems, which show a strong excess of star
formation (see e.g. \citeplain
1987AJ…..93.1011K,1987ApJ…320…49B,1988ApJ…335…74B,1988ARA&A..26..343T,1991ApJ…374..407X,1995ApJ…450..547L,1998AJ….115..938B,2002ApJS..143…47D,2003ApJS..148..353T,2004A&A…425..813B,2005AJ….130.2117S,2006ApJ…642..158E,2006AJ….132..197W,2007AJ….134..527W).
The young extragalactic star clusters belonging to these systems have
been the aim of different studies during the last decades (e.g.
\citeplain
1991MNRAS.253..245D,1992AJ….103..691H,1993AJ….106.1354W,1999AJ….118.1551W,1999AJ….118..752Z,2005A&A…443…41M,2005A&A…431..905B,2006A&A…448..881B,2007ApJ…664..284T,2008arXiv0805.2559M).
The two most famous and emblematic examples of this phenomenon are the
Stephan’s quintet (see \citeplain 2001AJ….122..163G, and references
therein) and the pair called the Antennae galaxies (see \citeplain
1995AJ….109..960W, and references therein). In Figure 1.7 we show two
spectacular images of them. The enhancement of the SFR is highly
variable depending on the star formation conditions, the degree of
enhancement ranging from zero in gas-poor galaxies to around 10-100
times in extreme cases [ 1998ARA&A..36..189K ] . Much larger
enhancements are often seen in the circumnuclear regions of strongly
interacting and merging systems [ 1998ARA&A..36..189K ,
1998ApJ...498..541K ] .

Yet, the bulges of some nearby, non-interacting, spiral galaxies show
intense star-forming regions located in a roughly annular pattern around
their nuclei. Figure 1.8 shows the central part of NGC 4314 in false
colours with the central zone marked in a complete image of the galaxy
from McDonald Observatory.

In the middle of last century, \citetex 1958PASP…70..364M classified a
total of 608 galaxies from plates obtained mainly by Edwin Hubble in the
Mount Wilson-Palomar collection, using as the principal classification
criterion the degree of central concentration of light of each galaxy.
An apparent fairly common phenomenon in some types of galaxies was
pointed out by Morgan: their nuclear regions can consist of an extremely
brilliant, small nucleus superposed on a considerably fainter background
(NGC 4051), or it may be made up of multiple “hot-spots” (NGC 5248,
1808, 4321, and 3351). Almost a decade later, \citetex 1965PASP…77..287S
suggested a relationship between the existence of a bar and the presence
of abnormal features in their nuclei for a survey of 35 bright southern
galaxies. Inspecting the Hubble plate collection at Pasadena, these
authors extended the survey to the whole sky [ 1967PASP...79..152S ] .
They restricted their discussion to galaxies brighter than 11.0 total
photographic magnitude [ 1963ApJS....8...31D ] in order to include the
southern objects previously studied by them. The final sample consisted
of 136 galaxies, 20 of which were found to have peculiar nuclei, among
them NGC 2903, 3310 and 3351, the galaxies studied in Chapter § 4 . They
found that @xmath 14 % of these galaxies presented peculiar nuclei.

At optical wavelengths, these circumnuclear star-forming regions
(CNSFRs) are easily observable rings. In Figure 1.9 we show two false
colour images of the central zones of NGC 1512 and NGC 7742, upper and
lower panels respectively, which display very nice ring patterns. In the
ultraviolet (UV), massive stars dominate the observed circumnuclear
emission even in the presence of an active nucleus [ 1998ApJ...505..174G
, 2002ApJ...579..545C ] . In Figure 1.10 we show the high-resolution
(0.025 @xmath px @xmath ) deep STIS ultraviolet image of the central
zone of the spiral galaxy NGC 4303 from \citetex 2002ApJ…579..545C. In
this image we can observe in more detail the previously unresolved star
forming knots (see the HST-WFPC2 data from \citeplain
1997ApJ…484L..41C), whose separation distances are less than 0.2 @xmath
( @xmath 15 pc at the adopted distance for this galaxy). As was pointed
out by Colina et al., the UV-bright nucleus remains a compact source,
showing properties very similar to the circumnuclear stellar clusters G
and L.

CNSFRs are also present in galaxies with active nuclei. Cid Fernandes et
al. [ * ] 2001ApJ…558…81C, for a representative sample of 35 Seyfert 2
galaxies, find that about 40 per cent of them show unambiguous evidence
of circumnuclear star formation within 300 pc of the nucleus and that
these star-forming regions contribute about 30 to 50 per cent to the H
@xmath total emission of the central zone.

The distinctive nature (with respect to the more extended star formation
in discs) of the luminous nuclear star-forming regions was fully
revealed with the opening of the mid- and far-IR spectral ranges (see
for example \citeplain
1972ApJ…176L..95R,1973ApJ…182L..89H,1978ApJ…220L..37R,1980ApJ…235..392T).
In general, CNSFRs and giant H ii regions in the discs of galaxies are
very much alike, although the former look more compact and show higher
peak surface brightness [ 1989AJ.....97.1022K ] than the latter. Their
large H @xmath luminosities, typically higher than 10 @xmath erg s
@xmath (see Figure 1.3 ), point to relatively massive star clusters as
their ionization source, which minimizes the uncertainties due to small
number statistics when applying population synthesis techniques (see
e.g. \citeplain 2002A&A…381…51C). Added interest in the study of CNSFRs
comes from the fact that they are in general of high metal abundance [
2006astro.ph..0787D ] , therefore they provide clues for the
understanding of star formation phenomena at large metallicities, and,
being close to the nuclear regions, for the determination of metallicity
gradients in spiral galaxies.

In Table LABEL:comparisonK we list a brief comparative summary between
the characteristics of the more extended star forming discs of spiral
galaxies and the circumnuclear star-forming regions (Table 1 of
\citeplain 1998ARA&A..36..189K). This shows that these two kinds of
objects differ in many aspects. The CNSFRs are specially distinctive in
terms of the absolute range in SFRs, the much higher spatial
concentration of gas and stars, its burst-like nature and its systematic
variation with galaxy type [ 1998ARA&A..36..189K ] .

### 1.2 Main objectives of this work

Spectrophotometry of bright H ii galaxies in the Local Universe allows
the determination of abundances from methods that rely on the
measurement of emission line intensities and atomic physics (the “direct
method” referred to above). In the case of more distant or intrinsically
fainter galaxies, the low signal-to-noise obtained with current
telescopes precludes the application of this method and empirical ones
based on the strongest emission lines are required. The fundamental
basis of these empirical methods is reasonably well understood (see e.g.
\citeplain 2005MNRAS.361.1063P). The accuracy of the results however
depends on the goodness of their calibration which in turn depends on a
well sampled set of precisely derived abundances by the “direct method”
so that interpolation procedures are reliable. Enlarging the calibration
range is also important since, at any rate, empirically obtained
relations should never be used outside their calibration validity range.

The precise derivation of elemental abundances however is not a
straightforward matter. Firstly, accurate measurements of the emission
lines are needed. Secondly, a certain knowledge of the ionization
structure of the region is required in order to derive ionic abundances
of the different elements and in some cases photo-ionization models are
needed to correct for unseen ionization states. An accurate diagnostic
requires the measurement of faint auroral lines covering a wide spectral
range and their accurate (better than 5%) ratios to Balmer recombination
lines. These faint lines are usually about 1% of the H @xmath intensity.
The spectral range must include from the UV [O ii ] @xmath
3727 Å doublet, to the near IR [S iii ] @xmath 9069,9532 Å lines. This
allows the derivation of the different line temperatures: T @xmath ([O
ii ]), T @xmath ([S ii ]), T @xmath ([O iii ]), T @xmath ([S iii ]), T
@xmath ([N ii ]), needed in order to study the temperature and
ionization structure of each H ii galaxy considered as a multizone
ionized region.

-    One of the main objectives of this thesis has been to design a
    methodology to perform a self-consistent analysis of the emitting
    gas in H ii galaxies adequate to the data that can be obtained with
    the XXI century technology. This methodology requires the production
    and calibration of empirical relations between the different line
    temperatures that should replace the commonly used ones based on
    simplistic, and poorly contrasted, photo-ionization model sequences.

In many cases, CNSFRs show emission line spectra similar to those of
disc H ii regions. However, they show a higher continuum from background
stellar populations as expected from their circumnuclear location, often
inside 500 pc from the galaxy centre. In early type spirals, CNSFRs are
also expected to be amongst the highest metallicity regions as
corresponds to their position near the galactic bulge. These facts taken
together make the analysis of these regions complicated since, in
general, their low excitation makes any temperature sensitive line too
weak to be measured, particularly against a strong underlying stellar
continuum. In fact, in most cases, the [O iii ] @xmath 5007 Å line,
which is typically one hundred times more intense than the auroral [O
iii ] @xmath 4363 Å one, can barely be seen.

Accurate measures of elemental abundances of high metallicity regions
are crucial to obtain reliable calibrations of empirical abundance
estimators, widely used but poorly constrained, whose choice can
severely bias results obtained for quantities of the highest relevance
for the study of galactic evolution like the luminosity-metallicity
(L-Z) relation for galaxies. CNSFRs are also ideal cases to study the
behavior of abundance estimators in the high metallicity regime.

-    A second objective has been to develop a semi-empirical method for
    the derivation of abundances in high metallicity H ii regions that
    can be applied to the CNSFRs of our study. Given the weakness of the
    oxygen emission lines in their spectra our study has been based
    mainly on the sulphur emission lines observed in the far red
    spectral region.

Although CNSFRs are very luminous, not much is known about their
kinematics or dynamics for both the ionized gas and the stars. In fact,
the most poorly known property of star forming clusters in galaxies is
their mass.

There are different methods to estimate the mass of a stellar cluster.
Classically one assumes that the system is virialized and determines the
total mass inside a radius by applying the virial theorem to the
observed velocity dispersion of the stars ( @xmath ). The stellar
velocity dispersion is however hard to measure in young stellar clusters
(a few million-years old) due to the shortage of prominent stellar
absorption lines. The optical continuum between 3500 and 7000 Å shows
very few lines since the light at these wavelengths is dominated by OB
stars which have weak absorption lines at the same wavelengths of the
nebular emission lines (Balmer H and He i lines). A better situation is
encountered at longer wavelengths (far red). There, the contamination
due to nebular lines is much smaller and the stellar [Ca ii ] absorption
lines at @xmath 8498, 8542, 8662 Å (CaT), if present, can be used. The
CaT lines in CNSFRs have previously been detected but at a spectral
resolution below that required to measure accurately their velocity
dispersions [ tesisdiego ] .

-    A third objective of this work has been to measure the stellar
    velocity dispersions of selected CNSFRs from the CaT lines and
    derive their dynamical masses. The comparison of these masses with
    those inferred from the number of ionizing photons in the region
    will give an estimate of the contribution of the present star
    formation episode to the mass proceeding from previous stellar
    generations and will help to characterize the star formation history
    of these objects.

A comparison between the velocity dispersions of gas and stars in CNSFRs
is also of the greatest importance for the interpretation of the motions
of the gas in the clusters and the influence of their gravitational
fields. Also, the investigation of the presence of gas infall or outflow
in the central regions of the galaxies where CNSFRs reside is important.

-    To perform this comparison has been another objective of this work.
    For this, we have used high dispersion spectroscopic observations
    and analysis techniques that involve the simultaneous fit of
    different velocity components.

### 1.3 Structure of this thesis

This thesis is structured into two main parts. The first one is related
to the sample H ii galaxies, and the second to the CNSFRs.

In Chapter § 2 a methodology is proposed to perform a self-consistent
analysis of the physical properties of the emitting gas of H ii
galaxies, while Chapter § 3 is focused on the study of the strong
optical collisional emission lines of Ne and Ar in ionized gaseous
nebulae for which new ionization correction factors for these two
elements are calculated.

Chapters § 4 and § 5 deal with the study of star formation in
circumnuclear regions. The former is dedicated to the study of the
kinematical properties of gas and stars in a sample of CNSFRs, and the
derivation of their dynamical masses, the masses and some properties of
their ionizing stellar cluster, and the masses of the ionized gas, while
the latter is devoted to the derivation of their chemical abundances by
a semi-empirical method.

Finally, in the last Chapter of this thesis, § 6 , we present the
general conclusions of this work and we list some of the future projects
that stem from it.
