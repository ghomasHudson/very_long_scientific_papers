This thesis describes the development of the density matrix embedding theory
(DMET) and its applications to lattice strongly correlated electron problems,
including a review of DMET theory and algorithms (Ch 2), investigation of
finite size scaling (Ch 3), Applications to high-temperature superconductivity
(Ch 4-6), a framework for finite-temperature DMET (Ch 7).
