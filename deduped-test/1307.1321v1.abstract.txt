This thesis considers the propagation of accelerated electron beams in
plasma. We consider the wave particle interactions these undergo which cause
their evolution, the effects of plasma density inhomogeneities on these
interactions, and the effects this may have on the production of hard X-ray and
radio emission by the beam. ...
