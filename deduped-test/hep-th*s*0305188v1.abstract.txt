This thesis first gives a background and review of the article
hep-th/0102038, where we substantiated a conjectured duality between two a
priori unrelated gauge theories, N=2 quiver theory and N=2 Seiberg-Witten
theory. These gauge theories have different realisations as the worldvolume
theories on different D-brane configurations. We showed that there is an
identity between the spaces of vacua (moduli spaces) arising in the two
theories, which suggests that the corresponding string theory pictures are
dual. Second, the thesis gives a background and description of the analysis
performed in the three articles hep-th/0111161, hep-th/0202069 and
hep-th/0304013, where we derived the most general, local, superconformal
boundary conditions of the two-dimensional nonlinear sigma model. This model
describes the dynamics of open strings, and the boundary conditions dictate the
geometry of D-branes. In the last article we studied these boundary conditions
for the special case of WZW models.
