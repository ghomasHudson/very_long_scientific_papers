In this thesis, we investigate all warped AdS @xmath and AdS @xmath
backgrounds with the most general allowed fluxes that preserve more than
16 supersymmetries in 10- and 11-dimensional supergravities. Assuming
either that the internal manifold is compact without boundary or that
the isometry algebra of the background decomposes into that of AdS and
that of the transverse space, we find that there are no AdS @xmath
backgrounds in IIB supergravity. Similarly, we find a unique such
background with 24 supersymmetries in IIA supergravity, locally
isometric to @xmath . In 11-dimensional supergravity all more than half
BPS AdS backgrounds are shown to be locally isometric to the maximally
supersymmetric @xmath solution. Furthermore, we prove a non-existence
theorem for AdS @xmath solutions preserving more than 16
supersymmetries. Finally, we demonstrate that warped Minkowski space
backgrounds of the form @xmath ( @xmath ) in 11-dimensional and type II
supergravities preserving strictly more than 16 supersymmetries and with
fields, which may not be smooth everywhere, are locally isometric to the
Minkowski vacuum @xmath . In particular, all such flux compactification
vacua of these theories have the same local geometry as the maximally
supersymmetric vacuum @xmath .
