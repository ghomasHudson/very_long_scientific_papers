We present the results of a search for new particles decaying to tau pairs
using the data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 195 pb^-1 collected
from March 2002 to September 2003 with the CDF detector at the Tevatron.
Hypothetical particles, such as Zprime and MSSM Higgs bosons can potentially
produce the tau pair final state. We discuss the method of tau identification,
and show the signal acceptance versus new particle mass. The low-mass region,
dominated by Z -> tau tau, is used as a control region. In the high-mass
region, we expect 2.8 +/- 0.5 events from known background sources, and observe
4 events in the data sample. Thus no significant excess is observed, and we set
upper limits on the cross section times branching ratio as a function of the
masses of heavy scalar and vector particles.
