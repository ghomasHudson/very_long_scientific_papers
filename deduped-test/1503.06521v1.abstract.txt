This is a Bachelor's thesis on point estimators for incomplete tomography of
qutrits as of 2014, submitted to the National University of Singapore. The main
content of the thesis focuses on various methods of estimation such as maximum
entropy and average estimator and show that they are quite different. Numerical
simulations of these methods show however that these estimators perform very
close to one another. Therefore on this basis, there is no reason to favor one
method over another.
