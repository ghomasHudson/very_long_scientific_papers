Partitioning a graph into three pieces, with two of them large and
connected, and the third a small “separator” set, is useful for
improving the performance of a number of combinatorial algorithms. This
is done using the second eigenvector of a matrix defined solely in terms
of the incidence matrix, called the graph Laplacian. For sparse graphs,
the eigenvector can be efficiently computed using the Lanczos algorithm.
This graph partitioning algorithm is extended to provide a complete
hierarchical subdivision of the graph. The method has been implemented
and numerical results obtained both for simple test problems and for
several grid graphs.
