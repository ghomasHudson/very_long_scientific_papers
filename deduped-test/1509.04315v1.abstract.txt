This thesis explores the teleo-reactive programming paradigm for controlling
autonomous agents, such as robots. Teleo-reactive programming provides a
robust, opportunistic method for goal-directed programming that continuously
reacts to the sensed environment. In particular, the TR and TeleoR systems are
investigated. They influence the design of a teleo-reactive system programming
in Python, for controlling autonomous agents via the Pedro communications
architecture. To demonstrate the system, it is used as a controller in a simple
game.
