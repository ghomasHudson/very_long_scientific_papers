In this thesis, several aspects of Yang-Mills theory are studied. It begins
with the constrained quantization in the Coulomb gauge, using the Dirac bracket
formalism. A nonperturbative analysis of the infrared asymptotics of
propagators in any spatial dimension follows, and a connection to the Landau
gauge is given. In the Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian approach, a linearly rising
static color Coulomb potential is found, along with an infrared diverging gluon
energy, both signaling confinement. The propagators and vertices in the entire
momentum regime are calculated with the variational principle. In the
ultraviolet, a nonperturbative running coupling constant is studied, and
certain asymptotic forms of the propagators are postulated. Furthermore, the
back reaction of the gauge sector to the inclusion of external charges is
investigated.
