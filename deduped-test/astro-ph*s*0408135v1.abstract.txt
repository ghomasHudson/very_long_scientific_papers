Using the theory of collisional line broadening developed by Anstee and
O'Mara (1991, 1995) and the spectrum synthesis software developed by John Ross,
the abundances of Fe, Mg, Ca and Na in Alpha Centauri A are determined from
strong lines. The abundances are approximately 0.2 dex higher than in the Sun.
The derived abundances are independent of non-thermal motions in the atmosphere
of Alpha Centauri A.
  The microturbulence obtained from medium-strong lines using the abundances
obtained from the strong lines is 1.34 +/- 0.12 km/s, i.e., 0.20 km/s larger
than in the Sun, which is fully consistent with the lower surface gravity of
Alpha Centauri A. This microturbulence can then be used in determination of the
abundance of other elements for which there are no strong lines in the
spectrum.
  This thesis is the first application of this theory to determine abundances
and the microturbulence of Alpha Centauri A. Recent results are published by
