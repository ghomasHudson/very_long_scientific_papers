Watermarking and fingerprinting of relational databases are quite proficient
for ownership protection, tamper proofing, and proving data integrity. In past
few years several such techniques have been proposed. A survey of almost all
the work done, till date, in these fields has been presented in this paper. The
techniques have been classified on the basis of how and where they embed the
watermark. The analysis and comparison of these techniques on different merits
has also been provided. In the end, this paper points out the direction of
future research in these fields.
