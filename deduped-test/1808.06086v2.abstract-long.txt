The Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian for gravity is non-renormalizable at
loop level. However, it can be treated in the effective field theory
framework which means that gravity as an effective theory can be
renormalized when a proper expansion of the effective Lagrangian is
made. At the same time, the Feynman rules for gravity are very
complicated, although the resulting amplitudes do not have the same
complications. Therefore, in this thesis we want to simplify the Feynman
rules as much as possible by using the most general parameterized gauge
condition, adding all possible parameterized total derivative terms and
redefining the gravitational, ghosts and scalar fields in a general
parameterization way. By choosing the parameters in a specific way, we
obtain simplified Feynman rules, especially the triple and quadruple
graviton vertices are simplified. In addition, we verify our simplified
rules by calculating the amplitudes of scalar-graviton and
graviton-graviton scattering at tree level using the simplified and
standard Feynman rules. Finally, we show the utility of these simplified
rules by calculating some one-loop diagrams for scalar-graviton
scattering and comparing to the standard Feynman rules.
