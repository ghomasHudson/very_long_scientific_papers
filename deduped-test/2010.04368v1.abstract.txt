Video anticipation is the task of predicting one/multiple future
representation(s) given limited, partial observation. This is a challenging
task due to the fact that given limited observation, the future representation
can be highly ambiguous. Based on the nature of the task, video anticipation
can be considered from two viewpoints: the level of details and the level of
determinism in the predicted future. In this research, we start from
anticipating a coarse representation of a deterministic future and then move
towards predicting continuous and fine-grained future representations of a
stochastic process. The example of the former is video action anticipation in
which we are interested in predicting one action label given a partially
observed video and the example of the latter is forecasting multiple diverse
continuations of human motion given partially observed one. In particular, in
this thesis, we make several contributions to the literature of video
anticipation...
