This thesis focuses on the applications of mathematical tools and concepts
brought from nonequilibrium statistical physics to the modeling of ecological
problems.
  The first part provides a short introduction where the theoretical concepts
and mathematical tools that are going to be used in subsequent chapters are
presented. Firstly, the different levels of description usually employed in the
models are explained. Secondly, the mathematical relationships among them are
presented. Finally, the notation and terminology that will be used later on are
explained.
  The second part is devoted to studying vegetation pattern formation in
regions where precipitations are not frequent and resources for plant growth
are scarce. This part comprises two chapters.
  The third part of the thesis develops a series of mathematical models
describing the collective movement and behavior of some animal species. Its
primary objective is to investigate the effect that communication among
foragers has on searching times and the formation of groups. It consists of two
chapters.
  The fourth part covers the effect of stochastic temporal disorder, mimicking
climate and environmental variability, on systems formed by many interacting
particles. These models may serve as an example of ecosystems. The thesis ends
with a summary and devising future research lines.
