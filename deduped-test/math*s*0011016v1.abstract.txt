In this thesis a connection between the worlds of discrete and continuous
conformal geometry is explored. Specifically, a disk pattern production theroem
is proved using an energy which measures how ``uniform'' the angle data of a
triangulation is, see also math.DG/0002150. Then this energy is averaged over
all the Delaunay triangulation of a Riemannian surface to form an energy
measuring how ``uniform'' a metric is, see also math.DG/0010316.
