This thesis describes the design and implementation of several instruments
for digitizing and processing analogue astronomical signals collected using
radio telescopes.
  Modern radio telescopes have significant digital signal processing demands
that are typically best met using custom processing engines implemented in
Field Programmable Gate Arrays. These demands essentially stem from the
ever-larger analogue bandwidths that astronomers wish to observe, resulting in
large data volumes that need to be processed in real time.
  We focused on the development of spectrometers for enabling improved pulsar
science on the Allen Telescope Array, the Hartebeesthoek Radio Observatory
telescope, the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Telescope, and the Parkes Radio Telescope. We
also present work that we conducted on the development of real-time pulsar
timing instrumentation.
  All the work described in this thesis was carried out using generic astronomy
processing tools and hardware developed by the Center for Astronomy Signal
Processing and Electronics Research (CASPER) at the University of California,
Berkeley. We successfully deployed to several telescopes instruments that were
built solely with CASPER technology, which has helped to validate the approach
to developing radio astronomy instruments that CASPER advocates.
