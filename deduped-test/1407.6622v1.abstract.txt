The present thesis aims at studying the properties of symmetric nuclear and
pure neutron matter from a Green's functions point of view, including two-body
and three-body chiral forces. An extended self-consistent Green's function
formalism is defined to consistently incorporate three-body forces in the
many-body calculations. The effect of three-nucleon interactions is included
via the construction of a dressed two-body density dependent force. This is
obtained performing an average of the leading order three-body terms in the
chiral effective field theory expansion. The dressed force corresponds to the
use of an in-medium propagator in the average which takes into account the
correlations characterizing the system at each stage of the many-body
calculation. The total energy of the system is obtained by means of a modified
Galitskii-Migdal-Koltun sumrule to correctly account for the effect of
three-body forces. Microscopic as well as macroscopic properties of symmetric
nuclear and pure neutron matter are analyzed in detailed.
