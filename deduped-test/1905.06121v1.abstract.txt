This thesis focuses on the experimental creation and detection of a variety
of quantum correlations using nuclear magnetic resonance hardware. Quantum
entanglement, being most common and counter-intuitive, is one of the main type
considered in this thesis. Quantum correlations play a major role in achieving,
the much talked, computational speedup. Creation and detection of such
correlations experimentally is a major thrust area in experimental quantum
information processing field. Main goals of the studies undertaken in this
thesis were to come up with strategies to detect the entanglement in a
'state-independent' way and with low experimental resources. The core of all
the detection protocols is based on our own developed method which enables us
to measure any observable with high accuracy. The experimental protocol has
been successfully implemented to detect the entanglement of random two-qubit
pure states. Further, the schemes for the experimental detection as well as
classification of generic and general three-qubit pure states have also been
devised and implemented successfully. Quantum correlation possessed by mixed
and$/$or separable states e.g. non-classical, bound-entanglement and of
non-local nature were also investigated. In all the investigations, the results
were verified by one or more alternative ways e.g. full quantum state
tomography.
