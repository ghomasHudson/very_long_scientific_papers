In this thesis, we perform the lattice QCD analysis via the energy-momentum
component of gluons. By introducing the momentum cutoff to the link variable,
we investigate which energy-momentum components of gluons induce each QCD
phenomenon. We use the Landau gauge for the most part of the lattice QCD
analysis. In lattice QCD, we analyze color confinement, spontaneous chiral
symmetry breaking, topological charge, and the related topics. We also discuss
several comparisons with effective theories. As for color confinement, we
calculate the quark-antiquark potential, the color flux tube, and meson masses.
From quantitative analysis, we find that color confinement is induced by the
low-momentum component below 1.5 GeV. As for spontaneous chiral symmetry
breaking, we calculate the chiral condensate and the Dirac spectrum.
Spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is induced by the broad low-momentum
component which ranges even above 1.5 GeV. The present result suggests that
color confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking are induced by
somehow different energy-momentum components of gluons. As for topological
charge, we calculate the topological charge density and the Dirac zero mode.
Topological charge is induced by the broad energy-momentum component, which is
similar to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking.
