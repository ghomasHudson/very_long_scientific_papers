In this thesis, we construct a half-integral weight multiplier system on the
group SU(2,1). In order to do so, we first find a formula for a 2-cocycle
representing the double cover of SU(2,1)(k), where k is a local field. For each
non-archimedean local field k, we describe how the cocycle splits on a compact
open subgroup. The multiplier system is then expressed in terms of the product
of the local splittings at each prime.
