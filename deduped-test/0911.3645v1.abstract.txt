In this thesis, multipole expansions of mass, momentum and stress density
will be made for a body in Newtonian mechanics. Using these definitions;
momentum, angular momentum, center of mass, force and torque are defined for
$N$ gravitationally interacting isolated bodies. Equations of motions of such a
system are derived. Definitions of momentum, angular momentum, center of mass,
force and torque are made in a relativistic theory. Dynamical (gravitational)
skeleton is defined and the multipole moments of the dynamical skeleton are
found. Equations of motion for a test body moving in a gravitational field are
derived in terms of the multipole moments. Save the details of the derivations,
no originality in this thesis is claimed: it is intended as a review of the
subject.
