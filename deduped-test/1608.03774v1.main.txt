### Chapter 1 From empirical data to time-varying networks

Modern network science allows to represent and rationalize the
properties and behavior of complex systems that can be represented in
terms of a graph [ 112 , 43 ] . This approach has been proven very
powerful, providing a unified framework to understand the structure and
function of networked systems [ 112 ] and to unravel the coupling of a
complex topology with dynamical processes developing on top of it [ 44 ,
22 ] . Until recently, a large majority of works in the field of network
science has been concerned with the study of static networks, in which
all the connections that appeared at least once coexist. This is the
case, for example, in the seminal works on scientific collaboration
networks [ 108 ] , or on movie costarring networks [ 15 ] . In
particular, dynamical processes have mainly been studied on static
complex networks [ 22 , 44 , 125 ] . Presently, however, a lot of
attention is being devoted to the temporal dimension of networked
systems. Indeed, many real networks are not static, but are actually
dynamical structures, in which connections appear, disappear, or are
rewired on various timescales [ 68 ] . Such temporal evolution is an
intrinsic feature of many natural and artificial networks, and can have
profound consequences for the dynamical processes taking place upon
them. A static approximation is still valid when such time scales are
sufficiently large, such as in the case of the Internet [ 129 ] . In
other cases, however, this approximation is incorrect. This is
particularly evident in the case in social interactions networks [ 171 ]
, in which social relationships are represented by a succession of
contact or communication events, continuously created or terminated
between pairs of individuals. In this sense, the social networks
previously considered in the literature [ 108 , 15 , 96 ] represent a
projection or temporal integration of time-varying graphs, in which all
the links that have appeared at least once in the time window of the
network evolution are present in the projection.

The so-called “ data revolution ” has spurred the interest in the
temporal dimension of social networks, leading to the development of new
tools and concepts embodied in the rising field of temporal or
time-varying networks [ 68 ] . The recent availability of large digital
databases and the deployment of new experimental infrastructures,
indeed, such as mobile phone communications [ 120 ] , face-to-face
interactions [ 34 ] or large scientific collaboration databases [ 131 ]
, have made possible the real-time tracking of social interactions in
groups of individuals and the reconstruction of the corresponding
temporal networks [ 118 , 13 , 56 , 34 ] . Specially noteworthy in this
context is the data on face-to-face interactions recorded by the
SocioPatterns collaboration [ 167 ] , which performed a fine-grained
measurement of human interactions in closed gatherings of individuals
such as schools, museums or conferences. The newly gathered empirical
data poses new fundamental questions regarding the properties of
temporal networks, questions which have been addressed through the
formulation of theoretical models, aimed at explaining both the temporal
patterns observed and their effects on the corresponding integrated
networks [ 180 , 77 , 146 , 149 ] .

Empirical analyses have revealed rich and complex patterns of dynamic
evolution [ 72 , 65 , 120 , 54 , 34 , 165 , 10 , 157 , 103 , 79 , 68 ] ,
pointing out the need to characterize and model them [ 144 , 61 , 54 ,
156 , 180 ] . At the same time, researchers have started to study how
the temporal evolution of the network substrate impacts the behavior of
dynamical processes such as epidemic spreading [ 140 , 73 , 157 , 79 ,
103 , 85 ] , synchronization [ 52 ] , percolation [ 124 , 10 ] and
social consensus [ 17 ] . The alternation of available edges, and their
rate of appearance, indeed, can have a crucial effect on dynamical
processes running on top of temporal networks [ 151 , 169 , 62 , 130 ] .
A key result of these efforts has been the observation of the “ bursty ”
dynamics of human interactions, revealed by the heavy tailed form of the
distribution of gap times between consecutive social interactions [ 118
, 120 , 72 , 65 , 165 , 34 ] , contradicting traditional frameworks
positing Poisson distributed processes. The origin of inhomogeneous
human dynamics can be traced back to individual decision making and
various kinds of correlations with one’s social environment, while
reinforcement dynamics [ 180 ] , circadian and weekly fluctuations [ 76
] and decision-based queuing process [ 13 ] have been proposed as
explanations for the observed bursty behavior of social systems.
Burstiness, however, turned out to be ubiquitous in nature, appearing in
different phenomena, ranging from earthquakes [ 39 ] to sunspots [ 176 ]
and neuronal activity [ 83 ] , leading to the observation of a universal
correlated bursty behavior, which can be interpreted by memory effects [
78 ] .

The heterogeneous and bursty nature of social interactions and its
impact on the processes taking place among individuals makes evident the
need of no longer neglecting the temporal dimension of social networks.
In this Chapter we present some empirical data of social dynamics, and
we introduce the time-varying networks formalism used to analyze them.
First, in Section 1.1 we will give some basic definitions and concepts
useful to understand the behavior of temporally evolving systems,
extensively used in the following Chapters. Then, in Section 1.2 we will
present and analyze several data sets of different social interactions.
We will discuss in details the fundamental properties of face-to-face
contact networks, as recorded by the SocioPatterns collaboration [ 167 ]
, and characterize the main quantities that identify them. This analysis
will be useful in the next Chapters, since the SocioPatterns data will
be the benchmark for testing the behavior of the model presented in
Chapter 2 , as well as the substrate for the diffusion of the dynamical
processes considered in part II . We will also show the temporal
properties of the scientific collaboration networks [ 108 ] and
introduce the concept of activity potential, at the core of the
definition of the activity driven model, which constitutes the object of
study of Chapter 3 .

#### 1.1 Time-varying networks formalism

Network theory [ 111 ] traditionally maps complex interacting systems
into graphs, by representing the elements acting in the system as nodes
, and pairwise interactions between them as edges . In mathematical
terms, a graph is defined as a pair of sets @xmath , where @xmath is a
set of nodes and @xmath is a set of edges connecting nodes among them.
We usually denote by @xmath the number of nodes and by @xmath the number
of edges. A graph can be directed or undirected , where the latter case
implies the presence of a link going from node @xmath to node @xmath if
and only if the reverted edge, from @xmath to @xmath , exists in the
graph. A weighted graph is defined by assigning to each edge @xmath a
weight @xmath . Weighted graphs are useful to encode additional
information in the network representation. A graph is connected if all
possible pairs of nodes are connected by at least one path. A giant
connected component , useful to monitor in percolation processes, is the
largest connected part of the graph, usually comprehensive of the
majority of the nodes. A graph is usually represented by an adjacency
matrix , a @xmath matrix defined such that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

For undirected graphs, the adjacency matrix is symmetric, @xmath .

Network formalism can be easily extended in order to include temporally
evolving graphs, best known as temporal or time-varying networks [ 106 ,
68 ] . In temporal networks, the nodes are defined by a static
collection of elements, and the edges represent pairwise interactions,
which appear and disappear over time. The interactions can be aggregated
over a time window @xmath , corresponding to some characteristic time
scale of the dynamics considered, which can be tracked back to technical
or natural constraints, or can be arbitrary defined depending on the
context under study. For example, the time scale in scientific
collaboration networks [ 108 ] is given by the interval between
consecutive edition of the journal considered, while in physical
proximity networks [ 34 ] is often established by experimental setup.
The choice of the aggregation window @xmath is an important issue which
can affect deeply the structure of the resulting time-varying networks [
89 ] and have non-trivial consequences in the study of dynamical
processes taking place on top of them [ 138 ] . However, this procedure
is standard in the time-varying networks fields, and represents a
tractable and good approximation as far as the aggregation window is not
too large [ 138 ] . Although the temporal networks formalism is general
and suitable for the representation of any time-varying complex system,
in the present thesis we will deal exclusively with social interactions,
therefore, in the following, we will explicitly consider time-varying
social networks, whose nodes and edges represent individuals and their
interactions, respectively.

##### 1.1.1 Basics on temporal networks

In order to build a time-varying network representation, all the
interactions established within the time window @xmath are considered as
simultaneous and contribute to constitute a “instantaneous” contact
network, generally formed by isolated nodes and small groups of
interacting individuals. Thus, temporal networks can be represented as a
sequence of @xmath instantaneous graphs @xmath , with @xmath , with a
number @xmath of different interacting individuals and a total duration
of @xmath elementary time steps, each one of fixed length @xmath . An
exact representation of the temporal network is given in terms of a
characteristic function (or temporal adjacency matrix [ 112 ] ) @xmath ,
taking the value @xmath when agents @xmath and @xmath are connected at
time @xmath , and zero otherwise.

Coarse-grained information about the structure of temporal networks can
be obtained by projecting them onto aggregated static networks, either
binary or weighted. This corresponds integrating in time up to @xmath
the interactions between the agents, equivalent to taking the limit
@xmath . The binary projected network informs of the total number of
contacts of any given actor, while its weighted version carries
additional information on the total time spent in interactions by each
actor [ 120 , 68 , 73 , 158 ] . The aggregated binary network is defined
by an adjacency matrix of the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the Heaviside theta function defined by @xmath if @xmath
and @xmath if @xmath . In this representation, the degree of vertex
@xmath , @xmath , represents the number of different agents with whom
agent @xmath has interacted. The associated weighted network, on the
other hand, has weights of the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here, @xmath represents the number of interactions between agents @xmath
and @xmath . The strength of node @xmath , @xmath , represents the
average number of interactions of agent @xmath at each time step.

The aggregated representation is an useful benchmark to point out the
effect of temporal correlations [ 147 ] , and it allows to identify
interesting properties of the system. For example, the correlation
between degree and strength of a node represents the tendency of an
individual to spend on average more or less time in interactions with
the others, depending on the number of different peer he has seen, as we
will see in the next Section 1.2 . More in general, the strength of
links and individuals helps not only to understand the structure of a
social network, but also the dynamics of a wide range of phenomena
involving human behavior, such as the formation of communities and the
spreading of information and social influence [ 60 , 120 , 173 ] .

##### 1.1.2 Time-respecting paths

The temporal dimension of any time-varying graph has a deep influence on
the dynamical processes taking place upon such structures. In the
fundamental example of opinion (or epidemic) spreading, for example, the
time at which the links connecting an informed (or infected) individual
to his neighbors appear determines whether the information (or
infection) will or will not be transmitted. In the same way, it is
possible that a process initiated by individual @xmath will reach
individual @xmath through an intermediate agent @xmath through the path
@xmath even though a direct connection between @xmath and @xmath is
established later on. This information is lost in the time aggregated
representation of the network, where any two neighboring nodes are
equivalent [ 68 ] . At a basic topological level, projected networks
disregard the fact that dynamics on temporal networks are in general
restricted to follow time respecting paths [ 65 , 87 , 73 , 115 , 10 ,
68 ] . In general, time respecting paths [ 65 ] determine the set of
possible causal interactions between the agents of the graph, and the
state of any node @xmath depends on the state of any other vertex @xmath
through the collective dynamics determining their causal relationship.
Therefore, not all the network is available for propagating a dynamics
that starts at any given node, but only those nodes belonging to its set
of influence [ 65 ] , defined as the set of nodes that can be reached
from a given one, following time respecting paths. Formally, if a
contact between nodes @xmath and @xmath took place at times @xmath , it
cannot be used in the course of a dynamical processes at any time @xmath
. Moreover, an important role can also be played by the bursty nature of
dynamical and social processes, where the appearance and disappearance
of links do not follow a Poisson processes, but show instead long tails
in the distribution of link presence and absence durations, as well as
long range correlations in the times of successive link occurrences [ 13
, 34 , 54 , 10 ] .

For each (ordered) pair of nodes @xmath , time-respecting paths from
@xmath to @xmath can either exist or not; moreover, the concept of
shortest path on static networks (i.e., the path with the minimum number
of links between two nodes) yields several possible generalizations in a
temporal network:

-   the fastest path is the one that allows to go from @xmath to @xmath
    , starting from the dataset initial time, in the minimum possible
    time, independently of the number of intermediate steps;

-   the shortest time-respecting path between @xmath and @xmath is the
    one that corresponds to the smallest number of intermediate steps,
    independently of the time spent between the start from @xmath and
    the arrival to @xmath .

For each node pair @xmath , we denote by @xmath , @xmath , @xmath the
lengths (in terms of the number of hops) respectively of the fastest
path, the shortest time-respecting path, and the shortest path on the
aggregated network, and by @xmath and @xmath the duration of the fastest
and shortest time-respecting paths, where we take as initial time the
first appearance of @xmath in the dataset. As already noted in other
works [ 86 , 73 ] , @xmath can be much larger than @xmath . Moreover, it
is clear that @xmath ; from the duration point of view, on the contrary,
@xmath .

We therefore define the following quantities:

-   @xmath : fraction of the @xmath ordered pairs of nodes for which a
    time-respecting path exists;

-   @xmath : average length (in terms of number of hops along network
    links) of the shortest time-respecting paths;

-   @xmath : average duration of the shortest time-respecting paths;

-   @xmath : average length of the fastest time-respecting paths;

-   @xmath : average duration of the fastest time-respecting paths;

-   @xmath : average shortest path length in the binary (static)
    projected network;

Note that these averaged quantities are not sufficient to determine the
navigability of the temporal network, since the probability distribution
of the shortest and fastest time respecting path length and duration may
be broad tailed, indicating that a part of the network is difficult to
reach. A temporal network, indeed, may be topologically well connected
and at the same time difficult to navigate or search. Spreading and
searching processes need to follow paths whose properties are determined
by the temporal dynamics of the network, and that might be either very
long or very slow.

#### 1.2 Empirical data of social dynamics

The recent availability of large amounts of data has indeed fostered the
quantitative understanding of many phenomena that had previously been
considered only from a qualitative point of view [ 14 , 74 ] . Examples
range from human mobility patterns [ 28 ] and human behavior in economic
areas [ 134 , 133 ] , to the analysis of political trends [ 3 , 33 , 92
] . Together with the World-Wide Web, a wide array of technologies have
also contributed to this data deluge, such as mobile phones or GPS
devices [ 49 , 162 , 104 ] , radio-frequency identification devices [ 34
] , or expressly designed online experiments [ 35 ] . The understanding
of social networks has clearly benefited from this trend [ 74 ] .
Different large social networks, such as mobile phone [ 120 ] or email [
24 ] communication networks, have been characterized in detail, while
the rise of online social networks has provided an ideal playground for
researchers in the social sciences [ 70 , 90 , 50 ] . The availability
of data, finally, has allowed to test the validity of the different
models of social networks that have mainly been published within the
physics-oriented complex networks literature, bridging the gap between
mathematical speculations and the social sciences [ 166 ] .

Among the different kinds of social networks, a prominent position is
occupied by the so-called face-to-face contact networks , which
represent a pivotal substrate for the transmission of ideas [ 117 ] ,
the creation of social bonds [ 160 ] , and the spreading of infectious
diseases [ 96 , 141 ] . The uniqueness of these networks stems from the
fact that face-to-face conversation is considered the “gold standard” [
107 ] of communication [ 36 , 84 ] , and although it can be costly [ 63
] , the benefits it contributes to workplace efficiency or in sustaining
social relationships are so-far unsurpassed by the economic convenience
of other forms of communication [ 107 ] . It is because face-to-face
interactions bring about the richest information transfer [ 42 ] , for
example, that in our era of new technological advancements business
travel has kept increasing so steadily [ 107 ] . In light of all this,
it is not surprising that face-to-face interaction networks have long
been the focus of a major attention [ 12 , 23 , 8 ] , but the lack of
fine-grained and time-resolved data represented a serious obstacle to
the quantitative comprehension of the dynamics of human contacts.

##### 1.2.1 Face-to-face interactions networks

Recently, the so-called data revolution pervaded also the study of human
face-to-face contact networks [ 167 , 159 ] . Several techniques and
methods, with different spatial and/or temporal resolution, have been
used for monitoring physical proximity interactions. Mobile phone traces
[ 56 , 49 ] allow to monitor social relationship of a large number of
individuals, but cannot assess face-to-face contacts, unless a specific
software is provided. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi networks [ 144 , 88 ] have a
spatial resolution of a few meters and can only guarantee the spatial
proximity or co-location of individuals, being in general not a good
proxy for a social interaction between them. Finally, the MIT Reality
Mining project [ 48 , 94 ] collected rich multi-channel data on
face-to-face interactions, by deploying specifically designed
“sociometric badges”.

Here we focus on the SocioPatterns collaboration [ 167 ] , which
realized an experimental setup merging scalability and resolution, by
means of inexpensive and unobtrusive active RFID devices. This approach
can provide data from deployments at social gatherings involving from
few tens to several hundreds individuals, and the spatio-temporal
resolution of the devices can be tuned to probe different interaction
scales, from co-presence in a room, to face-to-face proximity of
individuals. In the deployments of the SocioPatterns infrastructure,
each individual wears a badge equipped with an active radio-frequency
identification (RFID) device. These devices engage in bidirectional
radio-communication at very low power when they are close enough, and
relay the information about the proximity of other devices to RFID
readers installed in the environment. The devices properties are tuned
so that face-to-face proximity (1-2 meters) of individuals wearing the
tags on their chests can be assessed with a temporal resolution of
@xmath seconds. According to his temporal coarse-graining, two persons
are considered to be “in contact” during an interval of 20 seconds if
and only if their RFID devices have exchanged at least one packet during
that interval. A schematic illustration of the sensing mechanism is
shown in Fig. 1.1 .

The empirical data collected by the SocioPatterns deployments are
naturally described in terms of temporal networks [ 106 , 68 ] , whose
nodes are defined by individuals, and whose links represent pairwise
interactions, which appear and disappear over time. As discussed in
Section 1.1 , in order to build temporal networks we need to aggregate
all the interactions occurring within a time window @xmath , which here
is given by the temporal resolution of the deployment, so that @xmath
seconds represents the elementary time step considered.

In the following we present and analyze several data sets gathered in
different social contexts: the European Semantic Web Conference
(‘‘eswc’’), the 25th Chaos Communication Congress (‘‘25c3’’) ¹ ¹ 1 In
this particular case, the proximity detection range extended to 4-5
meters and packet exchange between devices was not necessarily linked to
face-to-face proximity. , the 2009 ACM Hypertext conference (“ht”), a
geriatric ward of a hospital in Lyon (“hosp”), a primary school
(“PrimSchool”), the 2009 congress of the Société Francaise d’Hygiène
Hospitalière (“sfhh”) and a high school (“HighSchool”). A description of
the corresponding contexts and various analyses of the corresponding
data sets can be found in Refs [ 34 , 41 , 73 , 158 , 122 ] .

In Table 1.1 we summarize the main average properties of the datasets we
are considering, that are of interest also in the context of dynamical
processes on temporal networks. In particular, we focus on:

-   @xmath : number of different individuals engaged in interactions;

-   @xmath : total duration of the contact sequence, in units of the
    elementary time interval @xmath seconds;

-   @xmath : average degree of nodes in the projected binary network,
    aggregated over the whole data set;

-   @xmath : average number of individuals @xmath interacting at each
    time step;

-   @xmath : mean frequency of the interactions, defined as the average
    number of edges @xmath of the instantaneous network at time @xmath ;

-   @xmath /2T: average number of new conversations @xmath starting at
    each time step;

-   @xmath : average duration of a contact.

-   @xmath : average strength of nodes in the projected weighted
    network, defined as the mean number of interactions per agent,
    averaged over all agents.

Table 1.1 shows the heterogeneity of the considered data sets, in terms
of size, overall duration and contact densities. The contact densities,
represented by the values of @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , are useful in
order to compare and rescale some quantities concerning dynamical
processes taking place on top of different data sets, as we will see in
part II . We note that the 25c3 data set shows a very high density of
interactions (large @xmath , @xmath and @xmath ), due to the larger
range of interaction considered (4-5 meters) for this particular case,
while the others are sparser. The 25c3 data set is algo the bigger in
terms of size, thus having a larger average degree @xmath . However,
even without taking into account the 25c3 data set, all the quantities
considered vary of almost an order of magnitude, with the exception of
the average duration of contacts @xmath , which is constant across the
different sets. Moreover, as also shown in the deployments timelines in
[ 34 ] , some of the datasets show large periods of low activity,
followed by bursty peaks with a lot of contacts in few time steps, while
others present more regular interactions between elements. In this
respect, it is worth noting that we will not consider those portions of
the datasets with very low activity, in which only few couples of
elements interact, such as the beginning or ending part of conferences
or the nocturnal periods.

The contact patterns followed by the agents are highly heterogeneous. To
explore them, one can consider the frequency of contacts between one
individual and his peers. In this sense, one can rank the peers of each
individual according to the number of times he interacts with them, such
that for a each individual @xmath , agent @xmath is his forth-most-met
peer. In Fig 1.2 we plot the frequency distribution @xmath aggregating
over individuals with the same final aggregated degree @xmath
(representing the total number of different agents met) of 4 different
data sets. Fig 1.2 shows the frequency distribution @xmath for several
data sets and for different final aggregated degree @xmath , finding
that the probability that an individual interacts with his @xmath -th
most met peer is well approximated by the Zipf’s law [ 181 ] ,
independent of the individual’s final degree @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath . Therefore, people engage most of their interactions with
few peers, although interacting also with many other individuals, met
with diminished regularity. A consequence of Eq. ( 1.4 ) is that the
probability distribution of the frequencies of meeting different
individuals, @xmath , turns out to be power law distributed,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

a behavior verified by the empirical data sets.

As discussed in Section 1.1.2 , time-respecting paths are a crucial
feature of any temporal network, since they determine the set of
possible causal interactions between the actors of the graph. Moreover,
diffusion processes such as random walks or spreading are particularly
impacted by the structure of paths between nodes, as we will see in part
II . In Table 1.2 we report the empirical values of some quantities
defined in Section 1.1.2 , with respect to the shortest and fastest
time-respecting paths between nodes, for some of the empirical data sets
considered. It turns out that the great majority of pairs of nodes are
causally connected by at least one path in all data sets. Hence, almost
every node can potentially be influenced by any other actor during the
time evolution, i.e., the set of sources and the set of influence of the
great majority of the elements are almost complete (of size @xmath ) in
all of the considered datasets.

In Fig. 1.3 we show the distributions of the lengths, @xmath , and
durations, @xmath , of the shortest time-respecting path for different
datasets. In the same Figure we choose one dataset to compare the @xmath
and the @xmath distributions with the distributions of the lengths,
@xmath , and durations, @xmath , of the fastest path. The @xmath
distribution is short tailed and peaked on @xmath , with a small average
value @xmath , even considering the relatively small sizes @xmath of the
datasets, and it is very similar to the projected network one @xmath
(see Table 1.2 ). The @xmath distribution, on the contrary, shows a
smooth behavior, with an average value @xmath several times bigger than
the shortest path one, @xmath , as expected [ 86 , 73 ] . Note that,
despite the important differences in the datasets characteristics, the
@xmath distributions (as well as @xmath , although not shown) collapse,
once rescaled. On the other hand, the @xmath and @xmath distributions
show the same broad-tailed behavior, but the average duration @xmath of
the shortest paths is much longer than the average duration @xmath of
the fastest paths, and of the same order of magnitude than the total
duration of the contact sequence @xmath . Thus, a temporal network may
be topologically well connected and at the same time difficult to
navigate or search. Indeed spreading and searching processes need to
follow paths whose properties are determined by the temporal dynamics of
the network, and that might be either very long or very slow.

The heterogeneity of the contact patterns of the face-to-face
interactions [ 34 ] is revealed by the study of the distribution of the
duration @xmath of contacts between pairs of agents, @xmath . The
correspondent aggregated quantity is the total time spent in contact by
a pair of agents, represented in the temporal network by the weight
@xmath . Fig. 1.4 show that both distributions @xmath and @xmath are
heavy-tailed, typically compatible with power-law behaviors, with
exponents @xmath and @xmath for @xmath and @xmath , respectively. This
means that there are comparatively few long-lasting contacts and a
multitude of brief contacts, but the duration of the interactions does
not have a characteristic time scale, as also found in other works based
in Bluetooth technology [ 143 , 37 ] .

Remarkably, despite the settings and contexts where the experiment took
place are very diverse, different data sets display a similar behavior,
showing a nice collapse of the different curves. Concerning the duration
distribution @xmath , the only exception is the data set “PrimSchool”,
which decays more rapidly than the others. Specially noteworthy is the
fact that also the “25c3” data set, recorded with a larger detection
range, displays a close behavior, meaning that the spatial scale of the
interactions is not a discriminating signature of the observed dynamics.
The collapse in the weight distribution @xmath is less striking, with
the “25c3” and “hosp” data sets deviating slightly with respect to the
other, a fact due to their larger duration @xmath .

The burstiness of human interactions [ 13 ] is revealed by the
probability distribution of the interval @xmath between two consecutive
contacts involving a common individual and two distinct persons, @xmath
. In other words, if agent A starts a contact with agent B at time
@xmath , and later starts a different contact with agent C at @xmath ,
the inter-contact interval is defined as @xmath . As we will see in part
II , measuring this quantity is relevant for the study of causal
processes (concurrency) that can occur on the temporal network, such as
diffusion processes. The inter-contact intervals, indeed, determine the
timescale after which an individual receiving some information or
disease is able to propagate it to another individual. Thus, the
interplay between this timescale and the typical timescales of the
spreading processes is crucial to diffusion processes. In Fig. 1.5 we
plot the inter-contact distribution of a single individual, @xmath ,
(left) and considering all the individuals, @xmath , (right). The broad
form of both distributions indicate the absence of a characteristic
timescale. We note that the inter-contact distribution of a single
individual, @xmath , varies considerably depending on the data set,
while the the inter-contact distribution aggregated over all
individuals, @xmath , shows an interesting collapse of most of the data
sets, with the clear exceptions of the “25c3” and “PrimSchool” data
sets.

From the point of view of time-aggregated networks, it is interesting to
look and the probability distribution of the strength @xmath ,
representing the total time spent in interaction by an individual. In
Fig. 1.6 (left) we plot the cumulative strength distribution @xmath ,
representing the probability of finding an individual with rescaled
strength greater than the @xmath . One can see that the @xmath seems to
be compatible with an exponential decay, although the small sizes of the
datasets under consideration do not permit to establish the functional
form of @xmath accurately. However, some nodes can have a very large
strength, up to 5 times the average strength @xmath , in particular for
the “25c3” and “sfhh” data sets.

Face-to-face networks can be further characterized by looking at the
correlation between the number of different contacts and the temporal
duration of those contacts. In temporal networks language, these
correlations are estimated by measuring the strength @xmath of a node
@xmath , representing the cumulative time spent in interactions by
individual @xmath , as a function of its degree @xmath , representing
the total different agents with which agent @xmath has interacted. Fig.
2.3 (right) shows the growth of the average strength of nodes of degree
@xmath , @xmath , as a function of @xmath in various empirical datasets.
As one can clearly see, different data sets show a similar behavior and
can be fitted by a power law function @xmath with @xmath . This
super-linear behavior implies that on average the nodes with high degree
are likely to spend more time in each interaction with respect to the
low-connected individuals [ 34 ] . On the contrary, in mobile phone
activity [ 119 ] it has been reported a sub-linear relation between
number of different contacts and time spent in interactions. The
observed phenomenon points out the presence of super-connected
individuals, that not only engage in a large number of distinct
interactions, but also dedicate an increasingly larger amount of time to
such interactions. These highly social individuals may have a crucial
impact in the pattern of spreading phenomena [ 7 ] .

To sum up, the empirical data of face-to-face interactions recorded by
the SocioPatterns collaboration are naturally represented in terms of
temporal networks, and exhibit heterogeneous and bursty behavior,
indicated by the long tailed distributions for the lengths and strength
of conversations, as well as for the gaps separating successive
interactions. We have underlined the importance of considering not only
the existence of time preserving paths between pairs of nodes, but also
their temporal duration: shortest paths can take much longer than
fastest paths, while fastest paths can correspond to many more hops than
shortest paths. Remarkably, although the data sets are collected in very
diverse social contexts, the appropriate rescaling of the quantities
considered, when necessary, identifies universal behaviors shared across
the different data sets considered. These features call for a twofold
effort: On the one hand, a modeling attempt, able to capture the main
statistical regularities exhibited by empirical data, and on the other
hand, a study of the behavior of dynamical processes running on top of
temporal networks constituted by the same empirical data. These two
directions will be both explored in the next Chapters.

##### 1.2.2 Scientific collaboration networks

Digital traces of human activity allow to grasp social behaviors and
reconstruct the network of social interactions including the temporal
dimension. One of the main drawbacks of the face-to-face contact
networks presented in the previous Section 1.2.1 is the relative small
sizes of the systems considered, which can hardly reach one thousand
individuals, due to technical and economic constraints. Large databases
of social interactions, on the contrary, such as mobile phone
communications [ 56 ] , online social networks [ 162 ] or scientific
collaboration data [ 108 ] , are cheap to collect and present the
advantage of scaling up to hundreds of thousands individuals. A
scientific collaboration network, for example, can be easily
reconstructed by using data drawn from databases of scientific
publications, such as the American Physics Society (APS) [ 1 ] . In this
simple network, two scientists are considered connected if they have
authored a paper together. In the past, the fundamental work by Newman [
108 ] showed that the scientific collaboration networks display scale
free degree distribution and small world properties. These networks,
however, present a temporal component that can be exploited, since the
sequence of editions of a scientific journal constitutes a time-varying
network, in which each instantaneous snapshot is formed by the
connections between the authors who published together in the same issue
of the journal. In this case, the time scale is fixed and one unit of
time corresponds to the interval between two consecutive issues of the
journal considered, Physical Review Letters (PRL), for example, is
weekly edited and therefore @xmath week. PRL was published for the first
time in 1958, thus the time-varying network obtained from APS data has a
total duration of more than 2700 time steps. The analysis presented in
the previous Section, regarding the heterogeneity and burstiness of the
temporal network and the topological properties of the corresponding
aggregated network, can be repeated as well, leading to qualitatively
similar results. Fig. 1.7 (left), for example, shows the distribution of
gap times @xmath between two consecutive publications by the same author
in PRL, @xmath . As one can see, the inter-event time distribution is
broad tailed, with the gap times ranging from one week up to almost
twenty years.

The large sizes of the scientific collaboration networks increase the
statistical significance of the probability distribution of the
structural and temporal properties considered, and therefore allow to
study other features of the corresponding time-varying networks. It is
possible, for example, measuring the activity of the individuals
involved in the social interactions, representing their inclination to
engage in a social act with other peers [ 131 ] . The activity potential
@xmath of agent @xmath can be defined as the probability per unit time
that he engages in a social interaction. In the case of the scientific
collaboration networks, it corresponds to the number of papers written
in collaboration with colleagues in a given time window [ 131 ] . In
Fig. 1.7 (right) we plot the probability distribution of the activity
potential, @xmath , measured in scientific collaboration networks
defined by different journals, such as Physical Review Letters (PRL),
Physical Review A (PRA), or Physical Review B (PRB), with data drawn
from the APS. Fig. 1.7 (right) shows that the activity distribution
@xmath is broad tailed and compatible with a power law form, with an
exponent close to @xmath , regardless of the journal considered.

The concept of activity potential is ubiquitous in social networks, and
can be applied to different kinds of social interactions. In Ref. [ 131
] , the authors analyzed three different empirical sets of data:
Scientific collaborations in the journal “Physical Review Letters”,
messages exchanged over the Twitter microblogging network, and the
activity of actors in movies and TV series as recorded in the Internet
Movie Database (IMDb). In the Twitter network the activity potential
represents the number of messages exchanged between the users, while in
the IMDb co-starring network two actors engage in a social act if they
participate in the same movie. It is possible to show [ 131 ] that the
activity distribution is broad tailed and, importantly, independent of
the time window considered in the activity potential definition. This
observation is crucial for the definition of the activity driven model,
proposed by Ref. [ 131 ] , in which a time-varying network is built on
the basis of the different activity potential of the nodes. We will
discuss in detail the activity driven model in Chapter 3 .

## Part I Models of social dynamics

Network modeling is crucial in order to identify statistical
regularities and structural principles common to many complex systems.
It has a long tradition in graph theory [ 51 , 105 , 172 ] , with the
class of growing network models [ 15 , 47 ] deserving a special mention
for its success, which has spilled over different fields [ 46 ] .
Recently, the interest towards the temporal dimension of the network
description has blossomed. The analysis of empirical data on several
types of human interactions (corresponding in particular to phone
communications or physical proximity) has unveiled the presence of
complex temporal patterns in these systems [ 72 , 65 , 120 , 34 , 165 ,
157 , 103 , 79 , 68 ] , as discussed in Chapter 1 . These findings have
raised the necessity to outrun the traditional network modeling
paradigm, rooted in the representation of the aggregated network’s
topology, regardless of the instantaneous dynamics responsible of its
shape. Efforts in temporal networks modeling range from social
interactions [ 149 , 156 ] and mobility [ 144 ] to air transportation [
54 ] , and are based in mechanisms such as dynamic centrality [ 61 ] ,
reinforcement dynamics [ 180 ] or memory [ 80 ] .

The modeling effort presented in this part of the Thesis has twofold
nature: First and foremost, it is aimed to reproduce the fundamental
properties of the empirical data, which have a deep impact on the
dynamical processes taking place on top of them. Secondly, it calls for
developing a theoretical framework, in order to find analytic expression
of the main quantity involved in the model, when possible. In
particular, in this part we will focus on two models of social dynamics,
concerning different fields of social interactions. On the one hand, in
Chapter 2 we will devote our attention to human contact networks . We
present and analyze a model, based in the social attractiveness of
individuals, capable to reproduce most of the main properties showed by
face-to-face interactions data. On the other hand, in Chapter 3 we will
focus on activity driven networks . The activity driven model is aimed
to bridge the gap between the well-known topological properties of real
social networks and the microscopic mechanisms yielding the observed
topology. Its simplicity allows some analytic treatment, and we will
derive both the topological properties and the percolation properties of
the time-integrated networks.

### Chapter 2 Human contact networks

Uncovering the patterns of human mobility [ 56 ] and social interactions
[ 74 ] is pivotal to decipher the dynamics and evolution of social
networks [ 112 ] , with wide practical applications ranging from traffic
forecasting to epidemic containment. Recent technological advancements
have made possible the real-time tracking of social interactions in
groups of individuals, at several temporal and spatial scales. This
effort has produced large amounts of empirical data on human dynamics,
concerning letter exchanges [ 118 ] , email exchanges [ 13 ] , mobile
phone communications [ 56 ] , or spatial mobility [ 28 ] , among others.
The bursty dynamics of human interactions has a deep impact on the
properties of the temporally evolving networks defined by the patterns
of pair-wise interactions [ 68 ] , as well as on the behavior of
dynamical processes developing on top of those dynamical networks [ 147
, 157 , 79 , 93 , 124 , 52 , 169 ] . A better understanding of these
issues calls for new models, capable to reproduce the bursty character
of social interactions and trace back their ultimate origin, beyond
considering their temporal evolution [ 131 ] . Previous modeling efforts
mostly tried to connect the observed burstiness to some kind of
cognitive mechanisms ruling human mobility patterns, such as a
reinforcement dynamics [ 180 ] , cyclic closure [ 77 ] or preferential
return rules [ 146 ] , or by focusing on the relation between activity
propensity and actual interactions [ 131 ] .

In this Chapter we present and analyze a simple model able to replicate
most of the main statistical regularities exhibited by human
face-to-face contact networks data. Avoiding any a priory hypothesis on
human mobility and dynamics, we assume that agents perform a random walk
in space [ 71 ] and that interactions among agents are determined by
spatial proximity [ 17 ] . The key insight of the model is the
suggestion that individuals have different degrees of social appeal or
attractiveness , due to their social status or the role they play in
social gatherings, as observed in many social [ 168 ] , economic [ 9 ]
and natural [ 142 ] communities. This insight is implemented by allowing
individuals, each characterized by an intrinsic social attractiveness ,
to wander randomly in a two dimensional space—representing the
simplified location of a social gathering—until they meet someone, at
which point they have the possibility of stopping and starting a
“face-to-face” interaction. Without entering into a precise definition
of attractiveness, we adopt here an operative approach: Attractive
individuals are more likely to make people stop around them, but they
are also more prone to abandon their interactions if these are initiated
by less attractive agents. We will see that these simple assumptions,
and the asymmetry of the interactions that they imply, are sufficient to
reproduce quantitatively the most important features of the empirical
data on contact networks.

The Chapter is structured as follows: Section 2.1 defines in detail the
model, while in Section 2.2 we compare the model behavior with respect
to the properties shown by empirical data. In Section 2.3 we show the
model robustness concerning the variation of the main parameters
involved. Finally, Section 2.4 is devoted to discussion, with particular
attention to the crucial role of social attractiveness in the model.

#### 2.1 A model of social attractiveness

The model is defined as follows (see Fig. 2.1 ): @xmath agents are
placed in a square box of linear size @xmath with periodic boundary
conditions, corresponding to a density @xmath . Each individual @xmath
is characterized by her attractiveness or social appeal, @xmath which
represents her power to raise interest in the others. The attractiveness
@xmath of the agents is a (quenched) variable randomly chosen from a
prefixed distribution @xmath , and bounded in the interval @xmath .
Agents perform a random walk biased by the attractiveness of neighboring
individuals. Whenever an agent intercepts, within a distance smaller
than or equal to @xmath , another individual, they start to interact.
The interaction lasts as far as the distance between them is smaller
than @xmath . Crucially, the more attractive an agent @xmath is (the
largest her attractiveness @xmath ), the more interest she will raise in
the other agent @xmath , who will slow down her random walk exploration
accordingly. This fact is taken into account by a walking probability
@xmath which takes the form:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the set of neighbors of agent @xmath at time @xmath ,
i.e. the set of agents that, at time @xmath , are at a distance smaller
than or equal to @xmath from agent @xmath . Hence, the biased random
walk performed by the agents is defined as follows: At each time step
@xmath , each agent @xmath performs, with probability @xmath , a step of
length @xmath along a direction given by a randomly chosen angle @xmath
. With the complementary probability @xmath , the agent does not move.
Thus, according to Eq. ( 2.1 ), if an agent @xmath is interacting with
other agents, she will keep her position in the following time step with
a probability proportional to the appeal of his most interesting
neighbor.

Furthermore, the empirical observations of SocioPatterns data show that
not all the agents involved in a social event are actually present for
its entire duration: Some agents leave the event before the end, some
join it later after the beginning, and some others leave and come back
several times. Therefore we assume that agents can be in an active or an
inactive state. If an individual is active, she moves in space and
interacts with the other agents; otherwise she simply rests without
neither moving nor interacting. At each time step, one inactive agent
@xmath can become active with a probability @xmath , while one active
and isolated agent @xmath (not interacting with other agents) can become
inactive with probability @xmath . The activation probability @xmath of
the individual @xmath thus represents her activeness in the social
event, the largest the activity @xmath , the more likely agent @xmath
will be involved in the event. We choose the activation probability
@xmath of the agents randomly from an uniform distribution @xmath ,
bounded in @xmath , but we have verified that the model behavior is
independent of the activity distribution functional form (even if we
consider a constant activity rate, @xmath for all agents, we obtain very
similar results, see Section 2.3 ).

Within this framework, each individual performs a discrete random walk
in a 2D space, interrupted by interactions of various duration with
peers. The movement of individuals is performed in parallel in order to
implement the time resolution ( @xmath seconds) at which empirical
measurements are made [ 34 ] . The model is Markovian, since agents do
not have memory of the previous time steps. The full dynamics of the
system is encoded in the collision probability @xmath , the activation
probability distribution @xmath , and the attractiveness distribution
@xmath . The latter can hardly be accessed empirically, and is likely to
be in its turn the combination of different elements, such as prestige,
status, role, etc. Moreover, in general attractiveness is a relational
variable, the same individual exerting different interest on different
agents. Avoiding any speculations on this point, we assume the simplest
case of a uniform distribution for the attractiveness [ 123 ] .
Remarkably, this simple assumption leads to a rich phenomenology, in
agreement with empirical data.

The model has been simulated adopting the parameters @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath . Different values of the agent density @xmath are obtained by
changing the box size @xmath . In the initial conditions, agents are
placed at randomly chosen positions, and are active with probability
@xmath . Numerical results are averaged over @xmath independent runs,
each one of duration @xmath up to @xmath time steps. Different choices
of the parameters, if any, are specified.

Before proceeding a comment is in order. We adopt here an operational
definition of “attractiveness” as the property of an individual to
attract the interest of other individuals, making them willing to engage
in a conversation, or to listen to what he/she is saying. Thus, we do
not enter in any speculations on what are the cultural or psychological
factors that make a person attractive in this sense, but we reckon that
many possible candidates exist, ranging from status [ 64 ] to
extroversion [ 143 ] . In light of the success of our model in
reproducing the empirical distributions (see Section 2.4 ), we consider
that identifying which feature, or set of features, the attractiveness
is a proxy of represents one important direction for future work.

#### 2.2 Modeling face-to-face interactions networks

The empirical data of face-to-face interactions show several properties,
universally shared across different social contexts, as broadly
discussed in Chapter 1 . In this Section we will compare the results of
the model, obtained by numerical simulations, against the observation
from empirical data. We focus on four data sets recorded by the
SocioPatterns collaboration representative of different social contexts:
a Lyon hospital (“Hospital”), the Hypertext 2009 conference
(“Conference”), the Société Francaise d’Hygiéne Hospitaliére congress
(“Congress”) and a high school (‘School”). These data sets have been
extensively analyzed in Section 1.2 , a further description can be found
in [ 34 , 73 , 158 , 41 ] .

In the following, we will explore human dynamics properties belonging to
three different scales. At the individual, or ‘microscopic’, level , we
focus in temporal properties related to the distributions of contact
durations or inter-contact times, and in structural properties related
to the time integrated representation of the contact data. Moving beyond
the analysis of individual properties, we consider the group, or
‘mesoscopic’, level , represented by groups of simultaneously
interacting individuals, which typify a crucial signature of
face-to-face networks and have important consequences on processes such
as decision making and problem solving [ 29 ] . We measure the
distribution of group sizes as well as the distribution of duration of
groups of different size. We finally zoom one more step out and inspect
the collective, or ‘macroscopic’, level looking at properties that
depend on the time interaction pattern of the whole population. We
address in particular the issue of the causality patterns of the
temporal network, as determined by the time-respecting paths between
individuals (see Section 1.1 ) and the network reachability, defined as
the minimum time for information to flow from an individual @xmath to
another individual @xmath and measured by means of a searching process
performed by a random walker (see Chapter 4 for further details). We
observe that the model reproduces not only qualitatively, but also
quantitatively, the properties measured from empirical data at all the
scales.

Finally, as a check for robustness, we explore the role of the the
parameters that define the model. Particular emphasis is made on the
motion rule adopted by the individuals. While a simple random walk for
the individuals’ movements is initially considered, in fact, a
consistent amount of literature suggests that Lévy flights [ 170 ] might
provide a better characterization of human movement [ 28 , 56 , 137 , 20
] . We observe that the results of the model are robust with respect to
various possible alterations of the original formulation, including the
adopted rule of motion.

##### 2.2.1 Individual level dynamics

Here we focus on the statistical properties of individual contacts, from
both points of view of time-independent and time-aggregated features.

###### Temporal correlations

The temporal pattern of the agents’ contacts is probably the most
distinctive feature of face-to-face interaction networks [ 34 , 147 ] .
We therefore start by considering the distribution of the duration
@xmath of the contacts between pairs of agents, @xmath , and the
distribution of gap times @xmath between two consecutive conversations
involving a common individual, @xmath . In Section 1.2 we discussed the
power law form of both @xmath and @xmath , indicating the bursty
dynamics of human interactions. Figure 2.2 show both distributions for
the various sets of empirical data along with the same distributions
obtained by simulating the model described above with density @xmath .
In the case of the contact duration distribution, numerical and
experimental data match almost perfectly, see Fig. 2.2 (left). It also
worth highlighting the crucial role played by the heterogeneity of
attractiveness @xmath . In fact, assuming it constant, @xmath (and
neglecting excluded volume effects between agents) our model can be
mapped into a simple first passage time problem [ 136 ] , leading to a
distribution @xmath with an exponential cut-off proportional to @xmath .
The (non-local) convolution of the exponential tails induced by the
heterogeneous distribution of attractiveness leads in our model to a
power law form, with no apparent cut-off, and with an exponent larger
than @xmath , in agreement with the result observed in the SocioPatterns
data. Regarding the distribution of gap times, @xmath , the model also
generates a long-tailed form, which is compatible, although in this case
not exactly equal, to the empirical data, see Fig. 2.2 (right).

###### Time-aggregated networks

A different information regarding the pattern of individual interactions
is obtained by integrating the time-varying network into a aggregated,
weighted network. As mentioned in section 1.1 , this corresponds to
considering all the interactions occurring in a given time window @xmath
in the limit of @xmath , i.e. all the interactions taking place in the
dataset. In Fig. 2.3 we plot the distribution of weight between pair of
agents rescaled by the total duration of the contact sequence, @xmath ,
(left) and the distribution of rescaled strength @xmath (right). The
heavy tailed weight distribution, @xmath , shows that the heterogeneity
in the duration of individual contacts persists even when interactions
are accumulated over longer time intervals. The strength distribution
@xmath , on the contrary, is more compatible with an exponential decay,
as better showed in Section 1.2 . Again, we see that the numerical
simulation of the model are in good agreement with empirical data. In
the inset of Fig. 2.3 (right), we show that the model is also capable to
capture the superlinear correlations found between the degree and the
strength of a node, @xmath , as discussed in Section 1.2 . An exception
of the good agreement is the “hosp” database. The reason of the
departure of this dataset with respect of both other data set and the
model could be attributed to the duration @xmath of the corresponding
sequence of contacts (see Table 1.1 ), which is up to four times longer
than the other data sets. In the limit of large @xmath , sporadic
interactions can lead to a fully connected integrated network, very
different from the sparser networks obtained for smaller values of
@xmath . These effects extend also to the pattern of weights, which have
in the “hosp” database a much larger average value.

A final important feature of face-to-face interactions, also revealed in
different context involving human mobility [ 146 ] , is that the
tendency of an agent to interact with new peers decreases in time. This
fact translates into a sub-linear temporal growth of the number of
different contacts of a single individuals (i.e. the aggregated degree
@xmath ), @xmath , with @xmath . Fig. 2.4 shows the evolution of @xmath
versus time for several agent with final aggregated degree @xmath , both
belonging to a single dataset (main) and for the different datasets
(inset). The sub-linear behavior of @xmath is clear, with @xmath
depending on the dataset. Moreover, the shapes of the @xmath functions
can be collapsed in a single curve by appropriately rescaling the data
as @xmath as a function of @xmath , Fig. 2.4 (inset). Fig. 2.4 shows
that, remarkably, the attractiveness model is also capable to reproduce
the behavior of @xmath , up to the rescaling with total @xmath time,
again with the exception of the “hosp” dataset.

##### 2.2.2 Group level dynamics

Another important aspect of human contact networks is the dynamics of
group formation, defined by a set of @xmath individuals interacting
simultaneously, not necessarily all with all, for a period of time
@xmath . As we have noted above, such groups have a sociological
relevance in their role of catalysts for decision making and problem
solving [ 29 ] . In Fig. 2.5 (top) we plot the probability distribution
of observing a group of size @xmath , @xmath , in any instant of the
ongoing social event, for the different empirical data sets. The
distributions are compatible with a power law behavior, whose exponent
depends on the number of agents involved in the social event, with
larger datasets (such for example the Congress one, see Table 1.1 )
capable of forming bigger groups with respect to smaller data sets.
Clearly, the model predictions are in substantial agreement with the
data when we inform the model with a sensible, data-driven, value of
@xmath .

In order to explore the dynamics of group formation, we define the
lifetime @xmath of a group of size @xmath as the time spent in
interaction by the same set of @xmath individuals, without any new
arrival or departure of members of the group. In Fig. 2.5 (bottom) we
plot the lifetime distribution @xmath of groups of different sizes
@xmath , finding that experimental and numerical results have a similar
power-law behavior. We note however that for empirical data the lifetime
distribution @xmath decays faster for larger groups, i.e. big groups are
less stable than small ones, while the model outcome follows the
opposite behavior. This means that, in the model, larger groups are
(slightly) more stable than observed in the data. This is probably due
to the fact that, the larger the group, the bigger the probability of
finding two (or more) individuals with large attractiveness in the
group, which guarantee the stability against departures. However, an
alternative explanation could be that the RFID devices of the
SocioPatterns experiment require individuals to face each other within a
given angle, making the group definition effectively more fragile than
in the model, where such directionality is absent.

##### 2.2.3 Collective level dynamics and searching efficiency

Time respecting paths of temporal networks have a deep impact in any
collective dynamics of the individuals, and are especially important
when studying dynamical processes taking place upon such structures. For
any two vertices, we can measure the shortest time-respecting path,
@xmath , and fastest time-respecting path, @xmath , between them. The
former is defined as the path with the smallest number of intermediate
steps between nodes @xmath and @xmath , and the latter is the path which
allows to reach @xmath starting from @xmath within the smallest amount
of time, as defined in detail in Section 1.1.2 . In Fig. 2.6 we plot the
probability distributions of the shortest and fastest time-respecting
path length, @xmath and @xmath , respectively, of both empirical data
and model, finding that they show a similar behavior, decaying
exponentially, and being peaked for a small number of steps.

Given the importance of causal relationship on any spreading dynamics,
it is interesting to explicitly address the dynamical unfolding of a
diffusive process. Here we analyze the simplest example of a search
process, the random walk, which describes a walker traveling the network
and, at each time step, selecting randomly its destination among the
available neighbors of the node it occupies. The random walk represents
a fundamental reference point for the behavior of any other diffusive
dynamics on a network, when only local information is available. Indeed,
assuming that each individual knows only about the information stored in
each of its nearest neighbors, the most naive economical strategy is the
random walk search, in which the source vertex sends one message to a
randomly selected nearest neighbor [ 4 ] . If that individual has the
information requested, it retrieves it; otherwise, it sends a message to
one of its nearest neighbors, until the message arrives to its final
target destination. In this context, a quantity of interest is the
probability that the random walk actually find its target individual
@xmath at any time in the contact sequence, @xmath , or global
reachability (see Chapter 4 for further details). This quantity is
related with a realistic case of searching, and has the advantage of not
being a asymptotic property of the random walk, thus it can be computed
also on finite contact sequences.

In principle, the reachability of an individual @xmath must be
correlated with the total time spent in interactions, namely his
strength @xmath , but it also depends on the features of the considered
social event, such as the density of the interaction @xmath , the total
duration @xmath and possibly other event-specific characteristic (see
Table 1.1 for information of the different data sets considered). On the
basis of a simple mean field argument, it is possible to show (see
Chapter 4 ) that the probability of node @xmath to be reached by the
random walk, @xmath , is correlated with its relative strength @xmath ,
times the average number of interacting individuals at each time step,
@xmath . In Fig 2.7 we plot the reachability @xmath against the rescaled
strength @xmath , showing that very different empirical data sets
collapse into a similar functional form. Remarkably, the model is able
to capture such behavior, with a variability, also found in the data,
which depends on the density @xmath of the agents involved. As noted for
the group dynamics, a larger density corresponds to a higher
reachability of the individuals. We note that the empirical data are
reproduced by the model for the same range of density considered in the
previous analysis.

#### 2.3 Model robustness

The model discussed above depends on different numerical and functional
parameters, namely the individual density @xmath , the attractiveness
distribution @xmath and the activation probability distribution @xmath .
As we have seen, some properties of the model, especially those related
to group and collective level dynamics, do indeed depend of the density
@xmath (or the number of individuals @xmath ), in such a way that the
model is able to reproduce empirical data only when fed with a value of
@xmath corresponding to the data set under consideration. The model
properties relevant to the individual level dynamics however, such as
the contact duration and weight distributions, @xmath and @xmath , do
not change in a reasonable range of density. In Fig. 2.8 one can observe
that the functional form of these distributions is robust with respect
to changes of the individual density, supporting the natural notion that
individual level dynamics is mainly determined by close contacts of
pairs of individuals, and rather independent of eventual multiple
contacts, which become rarer for smaller densities.

We have also explored the dependence of the model on the activation
probability distribution and the walking probability. In particular,
instead of a uniform activation probability distribution, we have
considered a constant distribution

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the Kronecker symbol. As we can see from Fig. 2.8 the
output of the model is robust with respect to changes of this functional
parameter.

Finally, in the definition of the model we have adopted the simplest
motion dynamics for individuals, namely an isotropic random walk in
which the distance @xmath covered by the agents at each step is constant
and arbitrarily fixed to @xmath . However, it has been noted for long
that a Lévy flight turns out to provide a better characterization of
human or animal movement and foraging [ 170 ] . In this case, the random
walk is still isotropic, but now the distance covered in each step is a
random variable, extracted from a probability distribution

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

with a long tailed form. In Fig. 2.8 we show that adopting a Lévy flight
motion dynamics gives rise to outcomes in very good agreement with the
original definition of the model. We note, however, that the step length
probability distribution @xmath has a natural cutoff given by the size
of the box where the agents move, @xmath , reducing the degree of
heterogeneity that the walk can cover.

#### 2.4 Summary and Discussion

Understanding the temporal and structural properties of human contact
networks has important consequences for social sciences, cognitive
sciences, and epidemiology. The interest in this area has been fueled by
the recent availability of large amounts of empirical data, obtained
from expressly designed experimental setups. The universal features
observed in these empirical studies prompt for the design of general
models, capable of accounting for the observed statistical regularities.

In this Chapter we have introduced a simple model of mobile agents that
naturally reproduces the social context described by the Sociopatterns
deployments, where several individuals move in a closed environment and
interact between them when situated within a small distance (the
exchange range of RFID devices). The main ingredients of the model are:
(i) Agents perform a biased random walk in two-dimensional space; (ii)
their interactions are ruled by an heterogeneous attractiveness
parameter, Eq. ( 2.1 ); and (iii) not all agents are simultaneously
active in the system. Without any data-driven mechanism, the model is
able to quantitatively capture most of the properties of the pattern of
interactions between agents, at different scales represented by the
individual, group and collective dynamics. Importantly, the match
between the model and the empirical results is independent of the
numerical and functional form of the diverse parameters defining the
model.

However, the attractiveness distribution @xmath used in the model
definition deserves a more detailed discussion. Its functional form is
hard to access empirically, and it is likely to be in its turn the
combination of different elements, such as prestige, status, role, etc.
Moreover, even though in general attractiveness is a relational variable
– the same individual exerting different interest on different agents –
we have assumed the simplest case of a uniform distribution for the
attractiveness. For this reason it is important to stress some facts
that support our decision, and to investigate the effect of the
attractiveness distribution on the model’s outcome.

The choice of a uniform @xmath is dictated by the maximum entropy
principle, according to which the best guess for a unknown but bounded
distribution (as the attractiveness distribution has to be, if we want
it to represent a probability) is precisely the uniform distribution [
75 ] . However, we can also explore the relation between the
attractiveness and some other variables that can be accessed
empirically. In particular, the attractiveness of one individual and the
strength of the corresponding node of the integrated network are
expected to be (non-trivially) related, since the more attractive an
individual is, the longer the other agents will try to engage him in
interactions. Fig. 2.3 shows that the strength distribution @xmath of
the time-integrated network obtained from the empirical data, which
follows approximately an exponential behavior, is well fitted by the
model. Thus, if we hypothesize that the attractiveness and strength
probability distributions are related as @xmath , with @xmath uniform in
[0,1], it follows that the strength of an individual should depend on
his attractiveness as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

We find that this relation is fulfilled by the model (data not shown),
showing that in the model the time spent in interactions by the
individuals is directly related with their degree of attractiveness.
Therefore the guess of a heterogeneous but uniform @xmath leads to a
exponential decay of the @xmath for the model, in accordance with
experimental data, and providing grounds to justify this choice of
attractiveness distribution. Moreover, the simple relation expressed by
Eq. 2.4 may suggest a way to validate the model, once some reliable
measure of attractiveness will be available.

Finally, it is worth highlighting that the form of the attractiveness
distribution @xmath is crucial for the model outcome. Therefore, it is
interesting to explore the effect of different functional forms of
@xmath , for example incorporating a higher degree of heterogeneity,
such as in the case of a power-law distribution. We note, however, that
the form of Eq. ( 2.1 ) imposes to the @xmath variable to be a
probability, with the consequent constraint of being bounded, @xmath . A
power law distribution defined over a bounded support presents the
necessity of imposing a lower bound to prevent divergence close to
@xmath . To avoid the insertion of a free parameter in the model, one
can redefine the motion rule of Eq. ( 2.1 ) as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

with the new attractiveness variable @xmath unbounded, @xmath . If we
impose the walking probability of Eqs. ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.5 ) to be the
same, and we use the relation @xmath , we find that the new
attractiveness distribution @xmath has the form of a power law, @xmath ,
with exponent @xmath . Therefore, assuming a motion rule of the form of
Eq. ( 2.5 ), a power law attractiveness distribution will give rise to
the same model results, as confirmed by numerical simulations.

On the same line of argument, it would be interesting to relate the
agents’ activation probability, @xmath , with some empirically
accessible properties of the individuals. Unfortunately, finding the
activation probability distribution @xmath is a hard task with the
information contained in the available datasets. In the face-to-face
interaction deployment, indeed, a non-interacting but active individual
is indistinguishable from an inactive individual who is temporary not
involved into the event. Thus, simply measuring probability to be not
involved in a conversation does not inform on the @xmath , but instead
considers something more related with the burstiness of the individual
activity. In any case, however, the model behavior is independent of the
functional form the activation distribution, so that this point is less
crucial.

In summary, we showed that a simple model is able to account for the
main statistical properties of human contact networks at different
scales. The proposed framework represents an important step forward in
the understanding of face-to-face temporal networks. Confronted with
other modeling efforts of SocioPatterns data [ 180 ] , our model is not
based on any cognitive assumption (reinforcement dynamics in Ref. [ 180
] ) and furthermore it leads to a good agreement with experimental data
without any fine tuning of internal parameters. It thus opens new
interesting directions for future work, including the study of dynamical
processes taking place on face-to-face networks and possible extensions
of the model to more general settings. Moreover, since the concept of
social attractiveness is crucial in the model definition, our finding
also prompt for further empirical research, based on more detailed and
extensive experimental setups, which can shed light on the role of this
attractiveness. Such research would help to further refine and validate
the model considered here, and could potentially provide new insights
for the social and cognitive sciences.

### Chapter 3 Activity driven networks

Research in the field of network science has mainly focused on a twofold
objective: A data-driven effort to characterize the topological
properties of real networks [ 5 , 45 , 31 ] , and a posterior modeling
effort, aimed at understanding the microscopic mechanisms yielding the
observed topological properties [ 5 , 112 ] . Great advancements in
these tasks have been made possible through the recent data revolution,
with the availability of large digital databases and the deployment of
new experimental infrastructures. Nevertheless, despite its importance,
the modeling effort in the time-varying network field is still in his
infancy [ 180 , 77 , 146 , 149 ] , while the recent availability of time
resolved data allows to deepen the study of the relation between the
temporal patterns observed and their effects on the corresponding
integrated networks.

In this Chapter we will focus on the activity driven network model
recently introduced by Perra et al. [ 131 ] , aimed to capture the
relation between the dynamical properties of time-varying networks and
the topological properties of their corresponding aggregated social
networks. The key element in the definition of this model is the
observation that the formation of social interactions is driven by the
activity of individuals, urging them to interact with their peers, and
by the empirical fact that different individuals show different levels
of social activity. Based in the concept of activity potential , defined
as the probability per unit time that an individual engages in a social
activity, Ref. [ 131 ] proposed an activity driven social network model,
in which individuals start interactions, that span for a fixed length of
time @xmath , with probability proportional to their activity potential.
The model output is thus given by a sequence of graphs, depending on the
distribution @xmath of the activity potential, which are updated every
time interval @xmath .

In the landscape of temporal network models surged in the last years,
the activity driven model has the peculiarity of allowing some analytic
treatment. Its simplicity, indeed, suggests a analogy with a class of
hidden variables models [ 32 , 25 , 145 ] , which opens the path toward
the analytic derivation of several quantities of interest. Through the
mapping to the hidden variable model, it is possible to compute analytic
expressions for the topological properties of the time-integrated
networks, as a function of the integration time @xmath and the activity
potential functional form @xmath . Moreover, the activity driven model
is an ideal framework to study analytically another problem of interests
in the temporal networks field, namely the connectivity properties of
the time-integrated networks. The effect of the integration time @xmath
in the structural properties of the aggregated network, indeed, is an
issue which has been recently shown to have relevant consequences for
dynamical processes [ 138 ] . The analysis presented in this Chapter is
thus twofold. On the one hand, we focus on the topological properties of
the aggregated network constructed by integrating the activity driven
network up to a given time @xmath . On the other hand, through the
expressions found for the aggregated network as a function of the
integration time @xmath , we study the percolation properties of the
time-integrated networks, as revealed by the percolation threshold and
size of the giant connected component in time. The formalism proposed
allows to draw interesting insights regarding the dynamical processes
running on the top of the activity driven networks, and can be extended
to generalizations of the activity driven model.

The Chapter is organized as follow: First, Section 3.1 defines the
activity driven model and reviews briefly the hidden variables
formalism. Then in Section 3.2 we derive the topological properties of
the time-integrated network and in Section 3.3 we compute the temporal
percolation properties of the activity driven networks. Finally, in
Section 3.4 we discuss possible extensions of the activity driven model,
while Section 3.5 is devoted to conclusions.

#### 3.1 The activity driven network model

In Section 1.2.2 we showed that the activity potential measured in
different social contexts is broad tailed and independent of the time
window considered, as revealed by the empirical analysis presented in
Ref [ 131 ] . This observation leads the authors to the definition of a
simple process model for the generation of random dynamic graphs, using
the activity distribution to drive the formation of a time-varying
network. Importantly, the model allows to study the dynamical processes,
such as random walks [ 130 ] or epidemic spreading [ 97 ] , unfolding on
the activity driven networks without relying on any time-scale
separation approximation.

##### 3.1.1 Model definition

The activity driven network model is defined in terms of @xmath
individuals @xmath (agents), each one of them characterized by her
activity potential @xmath , defined as the probability that she engages
in a social act/connection with other agents per unit time. The activity
of the agents is a (quenched) random variable, extracted from the
activity potential distribution @xmath , which can take a priori any
form. The model is defined by means of a synchronous update scheme, time
being measured in units of the life span of each connection @xmath . It
proceeds by creating a succession of instantaneous networks @xmath ,
@xmath At a given time @xmath , all previous edges are deleted and we
start with @xmath disconnected individuals. Each one of them is checked
and becomes active with probability @xmath . Active agents generate
@xmath links (start @xmath social interactions) that are connected to
@xmath other agents selected uniformly at random. Finally, time is
updated as @xmath . This procedure implies that all edges in the
temporal network have the same constant time duration @xmath . In order
to avoid complications due to the differences in the number of emitted
and received connections arising from using a synchronous approach ¹ ¹ 1
Indeed, in a synchronous scheme, every time step an agent fires at most
one connection, but can receive a number @xmath of connections, given
trivially by a binomial distribution. , here we consider a probabilistic
recipe for the instantaneous network construction: Each microscopic time
step @xmath , we choose @xmath agents, uniformly at random, and check
sequentially each one of them for activation and eventual link emission.
We avoid self and multiple connections.

To simplify the analytical calculations performed below, in the
following we choose @xmath . Both quantities can be however restored by
a simple rescaling of the activity potential and the integration time
@xmath . We notice that imposing @xmath implies restricting the activity
potential to be probability, and thus to be limited in the interval
@xmath .

##### 3.1.2 Hidden variables formalism: A short review

The class of network models with hidden variables was introduced in Ref.
[ 25 ] (see also [ 32 , 145 ] ) as a generalization of the random
network Gilbert model [ 43 ] , in which the probability of connecting
two vertices is not constant, but depends on some intrinsic properties
of the respective vertices, their so-called hidden variables. This class
of models is defined as follows: Starting from a set of @xmath
disconnected vertices and a general hidden variable @xmath , we
construct an undirected network with no self-edges nor multiple
connections, by applying these two rules:

1.  To each vertex @xmath , a variable @xmath is assigned, drawn at
    random from a probability distribution @xmath .

2.  For each pair of vertices @xmath and @xmath , @xmath , with hidden
    variables @xmath and @xmath , respectively, an edge is created with
    probability @xmath , the connection probability, which is a
    symmetric function bounded by @xmath .

Each model in the class is fully defined by the functions @xmath and
@xmath , and all its topological properties can be derived as a function
of these two parameters. These topological properties are encoded in the
propagator @xmath , defined as the conditional probability that a vertex
with hidden variable @xmath ends up connected to @xmath other vertices.
The propagator is a normalized function, @xmath , whose generating
function @xmath fulfills the general equation [ 25 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

From this propagator, expressions for the topological properties of the
model can be readily obtained [ 25 ] :

-   Degree distribution:

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (3.2)
      -- -------- -- -------

-   Moments of the degree distribution:

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (3.3)
      -- -------- -- -------

-   Degree correlations, which can be measured by the average degree of
    the neighbors of the vertices of degree @xmath , @xmath [ 126 ] :

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (3.4)
      -- -------- -- -------

    where we have defined

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (3.5)
      -- -------- -- -------

    and the average degree of the vertices with hidden variable @xmath ,

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (3.6)
      -- -------- -- -------

-   Average clustering coefficient @xmath , defined as the probability
    that two vertices are connected, provided that they share a common
    neighbor [ 174 ]

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (3.7)
      -- -------- -- -------

    where we have defined

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (3.8)
      -- -------- -- -------

    and

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (3.9)
      -- -------- -- -------

    Additionally, one can define the clustering spectrum, as measured by
    the average clustering coefficient of the vertices of degree @xmath
    , @xmath [ 126 , 135 ]

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (3.10)
      -- -------- -- --------

#### 3.2 Time-integrated activity driven networks

In this Section we address the study of the aggregated network generated
by the activity driven model, obtained by integrating the time-varying
network up to a given time @xmath . The activity-driven network model,
indeed, generates a time series of instantaneous sparse graphs @xmath ,
each one with an average degree @xmath , where @xmath . The integrated
network at time @xmath is constructed by performing the union of the
instantaneous networks, i.e. @xmath . In this integrated network, nodes
@xmath and @xmath will be joined by an edge if a connection has been
established between @xmath and @xmath in any of the instantaneous
networks at @xmath . In Fig. 3.1 we show a schematic representation of
the activity driven model, with two snapshot at different time steps
@xmath and @xmath of the time-varying network, and the integrated static
network at time @xmath .

The topological properties of the integrated activity driven network
were related in Ref. [ 131 ] at the level of the degree distribution,
which, by means of approximate arguments, was shown to be proportional
to the activity potential distribution @xmath . However, despite the
interest of the model, expressions for the rest of topological
observables have been still lacking, a fact that hampers its possible
validation as a generator of realistic integrated social networks, as
well as the identification of the particular role that integration time
has on the behavior of dynamical processes running on top of the
temporal network [ 130 , 138 ] .

By considering a mapping of the integrated network to the hidden
variables model [ 25 ] reviewed in Section 3.1 , we are able to obtain
analytic expressions of several topological properties of the integrated
network, depending on the activity potential distribution and the
considered time @xmath . We obtain a set of expressions for the degree
distribution, degree-degree correlations and clustering coefficient of
the aggregated network that are exact in the limit of large network size
@xmath and finite time @xmath , and which are amenable to analytic
asymptotic expansions in this same limit. The expressions obtained,
confirmed by numerical simulations, corroborate the basic assumption of
the activity driven model linking social activity with network topology.

##### 3.2.1 Mapping the integrated network to a hidden variables model

The key point to map the integrated network to a hidden variables model
resides in computing the probability @xmath that two vertices @xmath and
@xmath become eventually joined at time @xmath . This probability is
given by @xmath , where @xmath , the probability that no connection has
ever been created between agents @xmath and @xmath up to time @xmath ,
can be calculated as follows: At time @xmath , an agent @xmath will have
become active @xmath times with probability @xmath . Given the
definition of the model, at time @xmath we have selected @xmath agents
to check for activation. The number of times @xmath that agent @xmath
has become active will be given by the binomial distribution

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

and analogously for agent @xmath . Now, vertices @xmath and @xmath will
be connected in the integrated network if at least one of the links
generated from @xmath reaches @xmath , or vice-versa. Since every time
that she becomes active, an agent creates a connection targeted to a
randomly chosen peer, the probability @xmath is given by

  -- -- -- --------
           (3.12)
  -- -- -- --------

where we have performed the summation using the probability distribution
in Eq. ( 3.11 ). We see now that the probability that agents @xmath and
@xmath are connected in the integrated network at time @xmath depends
only on their respective activity potentials @xmath and @xmath , which
are random variables with distribution @xmath . The mapping to a hidden
variables network is thus transparent:

-   Hidden variable: @xmath .

-   Distribution of hidden variables: @xmath .

-   Connection probability: @xmath .

At very large times, the integrated network emerging from the activity
driven model will trivially tend to a fully connected network.
Interesting topology will thus be restricted to the limit of small
@xmath compared with the network size @xmath . In this limit, Eq. ( 3.12
) can be simplified, yielding

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have neglected terms of order @xmath and defined the parameter

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

An explicit calculation of the connection probability for a factor
@xmath and a time interval @xmath can be easily performed; in the limit
of large @xmath and constant @xmath , the only change ensuing is a
rescaling of time, @xmath , the value of @xmath becoming canceled in the
process of taking the limit @xmath .

##### 3.2.2 Topological properties

Here we will apply the formalism presented in Sec. 3.1.2 to provide
analytic expressions characterizing the topology of the integrated
network resulting from the activity driven model. For the sake of
concreteness, we will focus in the following activity potential
distributions, in the continuous @xmath limit:

-   Constant activity:

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

-   Homogeneous activity:

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (3.15)
      -- -------- -- --------

-   Power-law distributed activity:

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (3.16)
      -- -------- -- --------

In the last case, where we consider @xmath , in accordance with
experimental evidence [ 131 ] , we have introduced a lower cut-off
@xmath in order to avoid dangerous divergences in the vicinity of zero.

###### Degree distribution

In order to compute the degree distribution we have to solve and invert
the generating function equation Eq. ( 3.1 ), an almost impossible task
to perform exactly, except in the case of very simple forms of the
activity potential distribution. So, in the case of constant activity,
@xmath , we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

which corresponds to the generating function of a binomial distribution
[ 177 ] . Therefore, in the limit of large @xmath and constant @xmath ,
the degree distribution takes the Poisson form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

with parameter @xmath , which, for fixed @xmath and large @xmath , can
be approximated as @xmath .

For a nontrivial activity distribution @xmath , we must resort to
approximations. We therefore focus in the interesting limit of small
@xmath , which corresponds to fixed @xmath and large @xmath , which is
the one yielding a non-trivial topology. In this limit, we can
approximate the connection probability as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

Introducing this expression into Eq. ( 3.1 ) and performing a new
expansion at first order in @xmath , we obtain [ 25 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

The generating function of the propagator is a pure exponential, which
indicates that the propagator itself is a Poisson distribution [ 177 ] ,
i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the Gamma (factorial) function [ 2 ] . From Eq. ( 3.2 )
we obtain the general expression for the degree distribution

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the case of a homogeneous activity distribution, @xmath , for which
@xmath , we can integrate directly Eq. ( 3.22 ), to obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the incomplete Gamma function [ 2 ] . In Fig. 3.2 we
plot the degree distribution @xmath of the aggregated network at
different values of @xmath , for constant and homogeneous activity
potential, @xmath and @xmath , respectively, showing the perfect
agreement between numerical results and theoretical prediction given by
Eqs. ( 3.18 ) and ( 3.23 ).

More complex forms of the activity distribution do not easily yield to
an exact integration, and more approximations must be performed. In
particular, the asymptotic form of the degree distribution can be
obtained by performing a steepest descent approximation. Thus, we can
write

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have defined

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

The function @xmath has a sharp maximum around @xmath . Performing a
Taylor expansion up to second order, we can write @xmath , with @xmath .
Now, for @xmath , the function @xmath is strongly peaked around the
maximum @xmath ; therefore we can substitute the activity potential by
its value at the maximum, to obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have extended the integration limits to plus and minus
infinity. In the large @xmath limit, we can use Stirling’s
approximation, @xmath , to obtain the asymptotic form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this expression we recover, using more rigorous arguments, the
asymptotic form of the integrated degree distribution obtained in Ref. [
131 ] . The limits of validity of this expression are however now
transparent, being explicitly @xmath and @xmath .

For the case of constant activity, @xmath , the asymptotic form of the
degree distribution is @xmath , while the exact form is a Poisson
distribution centered at @xmath . For a uniform activity, on the other
hand, the asymptotic prediction is a flat distribution, while the exact
expression can be quite different, in particular for large and small
values of @xmath , see Eq. ( 3.23 ). For the case of a power-law
distributed activity, in Fig. 3.3 we plot the degree distribution @xmath
of the aggregated network at different values of @xmath for networks of
size @xmath and two different values of @xmath . As we can see, for such
large networks sizes and values of @xmath , the asymptotic expression
Eq. ( 3.27 ) represents a very good approximation to the model behavior.
In Fig. 3.3 we plot the degree distribution for a smaller network size
@xmath . As one can see, a numerical integration of Eq. ( 3.22 )
recovers exactly the behavior of @xmath even for small values of @xmath
. With such small network size, however, the asymptotic prediction of
Eq. ( 3.27 ) is less good, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3.3 .

###### Moments of the degree distribution

The moments @xmath of the degree distribution present a very simple form
given by Eq. ( 3.3 ). Since the propagator @xmath has the form of a
Poisson distribution, given by Eq. ( 3.21 ), @xmath are a direct
combination of the moments @xmath of the activity distribution, and
simply read as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are the Stirling numbers of the second kind [ 57 ] and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Degree correlations

We start from Eq. ( 3.6 ), which takes the form, as a function of time

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the Laplace transform

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

We can now use Eq. ( 3.5 ), which leads to the exact expression

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

In order to obtain an explicit expression for @xmath we must perform the
integral in Eq. ( 3.4 ). In the case of a constant activity potential,
@xmath , we have @xmath . Since in this case @xmath , we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the last expression corresponds to the limit of small @xmath .
This function is independent of @xmath , indicating that the integrated
network corresponding to constant activity potential has no degree
correlations.

For more complex forms of @xmath , we resort to an expansion in powers
of @xmath to obtain an approximate expression, which at lowest order
takes the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

Inserting this expression into Eq. ( 3.4 ), and considering the Poisson
form of the propagator Eq. ( 3.21 ), we can write

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where in the last expression we have performed the steepest descent
approximation used to obtain Eq. ( 3.26 ), and @xmath is the variance of
the activity potential @xmath . In the limit of large @xmath , where
@xmath , we have the general form for the degree correlations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

This expression recovers in a natural way the exact result for constant
activity potential, where @xmath . From Eq. ( 3.35 ) we conclude that,
in general, for an non-constant activity distribution, the integrated
networks resulting from the activity driven model show disassortative
mixing by degree [ 109 ] , with a @xmath function decreasing as a
function of @xmath . This disassortative behavior, which can be however
quite mild in the case of small variance @xmath , as in the case of a
power law distributed activity with small @xmath , is in any case at
odds with the assortative form observed for degree correlations in real
social networks [ 112 ] .

In Fig. 3.4 (left) we check the validity of Eq. ( 3.34 ) and the
asymptotic form Eq. ( 3.35 ) in the case of power law distributed
activity. We observe that the prediction of Eq. ( 3.34 ) recovers
exactly the model behavior, also in the case of small activity @xmath
(shown in the inset). The degree correlation, @xmath , is also correctly
captured by the asymptotic form Eq. ( 3.35 ). Note however that, since
the variance @xmath is small (of order @xmath for @xmath and order
@xmath for @xmath ), the net change in the average degree of the
neighbors is quite small, and the integrated network may be considered
as approximately uncorrelated, depending on the degree of accurateness
desired.

Another, global measure of degree correlations can be defined in terms
of the Pearson correlation coefficient @xmath between the degree of a
node and the mean degree of its neighbors [ 109 ] , taking the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

We can easily evaluate the sum @xmath by applying the hidden variable
formalism presented in Sec. 3.1.2 . Inserting in Eq. ( 3.36 ) the first
moments of the degree distribution as obtained from Eq. ( 3.28 ), the
coefficient @xmath in the limit of large @xmath reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the variance of the activity distribution. Both the
decreasing functional form of @xmath and the negative value of @xmath
(since @xmath for any probability distribution with a positive support),
indicate the presence of dissasortative correlations [ 109 ] in the
integrated activity driven networks, correlations whose amplitude is
modulated by @xmath . In Fig. 3.4 we show that the coefficient @xmath as
measured on activity driven networks obtained by numerical simulations
is very well fitted by the prediction of Eq. 3.37 . We note in
particular that scale free activity distribution with @xmath lead to
relevant degree correlations, as measured by the coefficient @xmath .

###### Clustering coefficient

The expression of the clustering spectrum at time @xmath , @xmath ,
takes the form, from Eq. ( 3.10 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using Eqs. ( 3.8 ), ( 3.9 ) and the expression for @xmath , we can write
the exact form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

Again in the simplest case of a constant activity potential, @xmath , we
have @xmath , which leads to a clustering spectrum

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the last expression is valid for small @xmath . The clustering
spectrum is in this case constant, and equal to the average clustering
coefficient. For fixed time @xmath , it is inversely proportional to the
network size, in correspondence to a purely random network. It increases
with @xmath , saturating at @xmath for a fully connected network in the
infinite time limit.

For a general activity potential distribution, we need to perform again
an expansion in @xmath , which in this case takes the form, at first
order in @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

Inserting this form into Eq. ( 3.38 ), and performing the same steepest
descend approximation applied in Eq. ( 3.35 ), we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the limit of large @xmath , we obtain the general form of the
clustering spectrum, valid for any activity potential,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

In Fig. 3.5 (right) we plot the clustering coefficient as a function of
the degree (main) and the activity (inset), in the case of power law
distributed activity. We observe that both Eq. ( 3.41 ) and Eq. ( 3.43 )
recover correctly the clustering coefficient behavior.

#### 3.3 Temporal percolation on activity driven networks

The connectivity properties of the time-integrated networks @xmath , and
in particular the birth and evolution of a giant connected component,
may have relevant consequences for dynamical processes running on the
top of @xmath , [ 138 ] . Indeed, at a given instant of time @xmath , a
temporal network can be represented by a single network snapshot, which
is usually very sparse, composed by isolated edges, stars or cliques. As
we integrate more and more of those snapshots, the integrated network
will grow, until at some time @xmath it will percolate, i.e. it will
possess a giant connected component with a size proportional to the
total number of individuals in the network. The time of the first
appearance of this giant component is not only an important topological
property of integrated networks, but it is also relevant for the
evolution of dynamical processes running on the top of the time-varying
graph, in the sense that any process with a characteristic lifetime
@xmath will be unable to explore a sizable fraction of the network.

In this Section we will focus on the percolation properties of the
time-integrated form of activity driven networks. Building on the
analytic expression for the topological properties of the integrated
networks at time @xmath , @xmath , found in the last Section 3.2 , we
compute analytic expressions for the percolation time and the size of
the giant component of the integrated network. An added value of our
approach is the possibility to extend the mapping of epidemic spreading
into percolation processes in static networks [ 110 ] into the temporal
case. Thus our results can be extended to provide the epidemic threshold
and the outbreak size of the susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic
model [ 7 ] .

##### 3.3.1 Generating function approach to percolation

Percolation in random networks can be studied applying the generating
function approach developed in Ref. [ 113 ] , which is valid assuming
the networks are degree uncorrelated. Let us define @xmath and @xmath as
the degree distribution and the excess degree distribution (at time
@xmath ) generating functions, respectively, given by [ 112 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

The size of the giant connected component, @xmath , is then given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath , the probability that a randomly chosen vertex is not
connected to the giant component, satisfies the self-consistent equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

The position of the percolation threshold can be simply obtained by
considering that @xmath is always a solution of Eq. ( 3.46 ),
corresponding to the lack of giant component. A physical solution @xmath
, corresponding to a macroscopic giant component, can only take place
whenever @xmath , which leads to the Molloy-Reed criterion [ 105 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

The moments of the degree distribution @xmath has been computed in
Section 3.2.2 : The ratio @xmath is a monotonic, growing function of
@xmath , and it will fulfill the condition of Eq. ( 3.47 ) for @xmath ,
defining a percolation time

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

This percolation time is independent of @xmath , and thus guarantees the
fulfillment of the condition @xmath assumed in the derivation of Eq. (
3.19 ). We can obtain information on the size of the giant component
@xmath for @xmath from Eqs. ( 3.44 ) and ( 3.2 ), using the Poisson form
of the propagator, which allows to write the simplified expressions

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.49)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.50)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

From the self-consistent Eq. ( 3.46 ), setting @xmath , and solving at
the lowest order in @xmath , we find, close to the transition,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath has been defined in Section 3.2.2 . Thus we recover the
Molloy Reed criterion, Eq. ( 3.48 ), for the onset of the giant
component. Since the derivatives of @xmath are finite, we can obtain the
size of the giant component @xmath by expanding Eq. ( 3.49 ) close to
@xmath ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.52)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Since Eq. ( 3.52 ) is obtained from a Taylor expansion for @xmath , we
expect it to be valid only close to the percolation threshold.

In order to check the validity of the analytical results developed
above, we consider the concrete case of two different forms of activity
distribution, namely a uniform activity distribution @xmath , with
@xmath , and the empirically observed case of power law activity
distribution in social networks [ 131 ] , @xmath , @xmath , where @xmath
is the minimum activity in the system. In this last case, we note that
the analytical form of the activity distribution is valid for small
@xmath only in the limit of large @xmath . Indeed, a simple extreme
value theory calculation [ 59 ] shows that, in a random sample of @xmath
values @xmath , the maximum activity scales as @xmath . Therefore, when
performing numerical simulations of the model, one must consider systems
sizes with @xmath in order to avoid additional finite-size effects. In
case of performing simulations for system with small sizes @xmath , for
example to study the finite size effects on the percolation threshold
(see next Section), we used a deterministic power law distribution to
avoid the cutoff effect on the maximum value of the activity due to a
random sampling of values.

Fig. 3.6 shows the giant component size @xmath of the activity driven
network as a result of numerical simulations for both uniform and power
law activity distributions. In Fig. 3.6 (left) we compare @xmath with
the analytical approximation Eq. ( 3.52 ), as well as with the result of
a direct numerical integration ² ² 2 The numerical integration has been
performed by using the function quad of the package SciPy with Python
2.7 . of Eqs. ( 3.45 ) and ( 3.46 ), for uniform activity and power-law
activity with exponent @xmath . In both cases we observe an almost exact
match between numerical simulations and the numerical integration of the
generating function equations, and a very good agreement with the
analytical approximation in the vicinity of the percolation threshold.
Fig. 3.6 (right), on the contrary, focuses on power-law activity
distributions with an exponent smaller than three. In this case we
additionally plot a numerical estimation of the percolation threshold as
given by the peak of both the variance of the giant connected component
size @xmath , @xmath , and the susceptibility of the clusters size,
@xmath , where @xmath is the number of cluster of size @xmath . From
this figure we can see that the numerical percolation threshold strongly
deviates in this case from the theoretical prediction Eq. ( 3.48 ),
deviation that increases when the distribution cutoff @xmath becomes
smaller.

##### 3.3.2 Effect of degree correlations on the temporal percolation
threshold

The origin of the disagreement for the case of power law activity
distribution with @xmath can be traced back to the effect of degree
correlations in the integrated networks generated by the activity driven
model. Indeed, as stated above, the generating function technique makes
the explicit assumption of lack of degree correlations [ 113 ] .
However, in Section 3.2 we showed that the integrated activity driven
network exhibits degree correlations. The average degree of the
neighbors of the vertices of degree @xmath , @xmath [ 126 ] , is a
decreasing function of @xmath (see Fig. 3.4 ), and the Pearson
correlation coefficient @xmath between the degree of a node and the mean
degree of its neighbors [ 109 ] can assume non-negligible values,
especially for networks obtained with scale-free activity distribution
with @xmath , as shown in Fig. 3.4 .

In order to take into account the effect of degree correlations let us
consider the general problem of percolation in a correlated random
network [ 55 ] . The effect of the degree correlations are accounted for
by the branching matrix

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the conditional probability that a node with degree
@xmath is connected to a node with degree @xmath [ 126 ] . The
percolation threshold is determined by the largest eigenvalue @xmath of
@xmath through the condition @xmath . If the network is uncorrelated,
the branching matrix does not depend on @xmath , @xmath , and thus
@xmath reduces to the ratio of the first two moment of the degree
distribution,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

thus recovering the Molloy-Reed criterion Eq. ( 3.47 ).

In activity driven networks we can compute the largest eigenvalue @xmath
in the limit of small @xmath by applying the hidden variables mapping
from Sec. 3.2.1 . In fact, the conditional probability @xmath of the
integrated network at time @xmath can be written as [ 25 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath , as follows from Eq. ( 3.6 ). From here, the branching
matrix takes the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we write @xmath as @xmath for brevity. Assuming that the branching
matrix is irreducible, and given that it is non-negative (see Eq. ( 3.53
)) we can compute its largest eigenvalue by applying Perron-Frobenius
theorem [ 53 ] and looking for a principal eigenvector @xmath with
positive components. Using the ansatz @xmath , we obtain that, in order
to be an eigenvector, the following conditions must be fulfilled:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

One can see that @xmath , in the limit of large @xmath . Thus we obtain
the equation for @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

By using the form of the moments of the degree distribution given by
Eq. ( 3.28 ), we solve Eq. ( 3.57 ). Excluding the non-physical solution
@xmath , one finally find the largest eigenvalue ³ ³ 3 From Eq. ( 3.58 )
one can find @xmath , confirming the validity of the proposed ansatz for
@xmath , implying @xmath . of the branching matrix as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

From here, the percolation threshold in activity driven networks follows
as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

We can understand the results of Fig. 3.6 by comparing the ratio of the
exact threshold @xmath with the uncorrelated value @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the case of a uniform activity distribution, we have @xmath , and
therefore the temporal percolation threshold is given with very good
accuracy by the uncorrelated expression. For a power-law activity
distribution, the ratio @xmath depends simultaneously of the exponent
@xmath and the minimum activity @xmath . Thus, for @xmath , we have that
@xmath , which diverges for @xmath , indicating a strong departure from
the uncorrelated threshold. For @xmath , on the other hand, @xmath
becomes independent of @xmath , and it goes to @xmath in the limit of
large @xmath . In the case @xmath and @xmath , for example, we obtain
@xmath . This implies an error of less than @xmath in the position of
the percolation threshold as given by the uncorrelated expression,
explaining the good fit observed in Fig. 3.6 (a).

In Fig. 3.7 we show the ratio @xmath as a function of the exponent
@xmath of a power-law distributed activity potential for different
values of @xmath , computed from numerical simulations by evaluating the
percolation threshold from the peak of the variance of the giant
component size, @xmath . The numerical result is compared with the
analytical prediction given by Eq. ( 3.60 ). In this Figure one can see
that, although numerical and analytical results are in quite good
agreement, they still do not exactly coincide for @xmath . This is due
to the presence of finite size effects, which have not been taken into
account in the percolation theory developed. We can consider the finite
size effects on the percolation time @xmath in a network of size @xmath
by putting forward the standard hypothesis of a scaling law of the form
[ 154 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

In Fig. 3.8 we plot the rescaled numerical thresholds @xmath estimated
by the peak of the variance of the giant component size @xmath (left),
and by the susceptibility of the clusters size @xmath (right), as a
function of the network size @xmath . We can observe that the numerical
thresholds @xmath asymptotically tend to the theoretical prediction
@xmath by following the scaling law of Eq. ( 3.8 ), with an exponent
close to @xmath , and different values of the prefactor @xmath depending
on the values of @xmath and @xmath . The two methods used to estimate
the numerical threshold give similar values for the exponent @xmath .
and a slightly different prefactor @xmath .

##### 3.3.3 Application to epidemic spreading

The concept of temporal percolation can be applied to gain understanding
of epidemic processes on activity driven temporal networks [ 131 ] . Let
us focus in the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIR) model [ 7 ] ,
which is the simplest model representing a disease that confers immunity
and that is defined as follows: Individuals can be in either of three
states, namely susceptible, infected, and removed. Susceptible
individuals acquire the disease by contact with infected individuals,
while infected individuals heal spontaneously becoming removed, which
cannot contract the disease anymore. On a temporal network, the SIR
model is parametrized by the rate @xmath (probability per unit time) at
which infected individuals become removed, and by the transmission
probability @xmath that the infection is propagated from an infected
individual to a susceptible individuals by means of an instantaneous
contact.

We can approach the behavior of the SIR model on activity driven
networks by extending the mapping to percolation developed in Ref. [ 110
] into the temporal case. To do so, let us consider first a modified SIR
model in which individuals stay in the infected state for a fixed amount
of time @xmath . We define the transmissibility @xmath as the
probability that the infection is transmitted from infected individual
@xmath to susceptible individual @xmath . Considering that contacts last
for an amount of time @xmath , the transmissibility can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.62)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the probability that individuals @xmath and @xmath
establish a contact in any given time step @xmath , as given by Eq. (
3.19 ). In the limit of large @xmath , we can thus write

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.63)
  -- -------- -- --------

From here we can deduce the form of the transmissibility when healing is
not deterministic but a Poisson process with rate @xmath . In this case,
the probability that an infected individual remains infected a time
@xmath is given by the exponential distribution @xmath . Therefore, we
can write [ 110 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.64)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

in the limit of large @xmath . If we consider the process of infection
as equivalent to establishing a link between infected and susceptible
individuals and we compare this expression with Eq. ( 3.19 ), we can see
that the SIR process can be mapped to the creation of the integrated
network in the activity driven model up to a time @xmath . The epidemic
threshold will be given by the existence of a finite cluster of
recovered individuals, and therefore will coincide with the temporal
percolation threshold, i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.65)
  -- -------- -- --------

The temporal percolation threshold given by Eq. ( 3.59 ) recovers the
epidemic threshold obtained in Ref. [ 97 ] using a mean-field rate
equation approach ⁴ ⁴ 4 Notice that in Ref. [ 97 ] the per capita
infection rate @xmath is used. . A particular benefit of this
percolation mapping is the fact that it makes accessible the calculation
of explicit approximate forms for the size of epidemic outbreaks, Eq. (
3.52 ) (valid however in certain limits), which are not easily available
in mean-field approximations [ 131 , 97 ] . Moreover, the finite-size
scaling presented in Section 3.3.2 allows to estimate corrections to the
epidemic threshold due to the size @xmath of the system considered.

#### 3.4 Extensions of the activity driven model

The potency of the hidden variables formalism we have introduced above
to solve the activity driven model allows to easily extended it to
tackle the analysis of generalized models inspired in the same
principles. We can consider, indeed, different rules for activation and
reception of connections. The only limitation to be imposed in order to
properly implement the formalism is that connection rules must be local,
i.e. involving only properties of the emitting and receiving agent. As a
simple example, we consider a sort of “inverse” activity driven model,
in which every agent @xmath becomes active with the same constant
probability @xmath and, when active, she sends a connection to another
agent @xmath , chosen at random with probability proportional to some
(quenched) random quantity @xmath , i.e. with probability @xmath . In
this case the quantity @xmath can represent the importance of the
individual @xmath in the social context, being the agents in the system
interested in engaging a social act with individual @xmath . One can
easily repeat the steps of the mapping presented in Sec. 3.2.1 : The
number of times @xmath that agent @xmath becomes active is now

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the probability that @xmath and @xmath become connected up to time
@xmath is

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath            
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where we have defined the new parameter @xmath and, in the last step of
the previous expressions, we have performed and expansion for large
@xmath a finite @xmath and assumed a bounded distribution @xmath for the
values @xmath . From here, we obtain @xmath . As one can see, this
modified model can be exactly mapped to the activity driven model (see
Eq. ( 3.13 ), with the simple translation @xmath ; all the general
expression derived above hold thus in this case, and can be worked out,
upon providing the selected expression for the distribution @xmath .

On different grounds, one of the most striking features of the empirical
social interactions under consideration is the broad tailed form of the
interevent time probability distribution, the well known phenomenon of
burstiness of human dynamics, presented in Chapter 1 . In its present
formulation, the activity driven model does not reproduce this empirical
fact, since one can easily check that the number of time steps @xmath
between two consecutive fires of a node @xmath has a probability
distribution of the form @xmath , a fact rooted in the Poissonian
process ruling the node’s activation. The waiting time distribution
@xmath decays exponentially in time, with a characteristic time scale
given by the inverse of the activity @xmath of node @xmath , at odds
with the scale free form of the interevent time distribution found in
many cases. In order to overcome this issue, one can move forward and
consider a generalization of the activity driven model, in which the
activation probability @xmath of node @xmath explicitly depends also on
time @xmath . The process of activation of an individual can be
interpreted as a renewal process [ 40 ] , being @xmath the probability
that individual @xmath becomes active in the interval @xmath , with
@xmath the time occurred since the last activation event. The waiting
time distribution can be obtained by applying renewal theory [ 40 ] ,
and reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

The original activity driven model can be recovered by considering a
constant activation probability, @xmath . The explicit time-dependence
of @xmath , on the contrary, opens the path toward non-Poissonian
dynamics, with the possibility of considering power law form of the
waiting time distribution. Importantly, the hidden variables formalism
presented in Section 3.1.2 still applies, and it is possible to compute
expressions for the topological properties of the time-integrated
networks as done in Section 3.2 . Therefore, although this conclusion
arises from a preliminary study, it seems to be possible to incorporate
in the activity driven model a more realistic non-Markovian activation
process, which leads to broad tailed form of the interevent time
distribution.

#### 3.5 Summary and Discussion

The activity driven model represents an interesting approximation to
temporal networks, providing a preliminary explanation of the origin of
the degree distribution of integrated social networks, in terms of the
heterogeneity of the agents’ activity, and the distribution of this
quantity. In this Chapter we addressed the activity driven networks
under an analytic point of view.

First, we have explored the full relation between topology and activity
distribution, obtaining analytical expressions for several topological
properties of the integrated social networks for a general activity
potential, in the thermodynamic limit of large number of agents, @xmath
, and finite integration time @xmath . To tackle this issue, we have
applied the hidden variables formalism, by mapping the aggregated
network to a model in which the probability of connecting two nodes
depends on the hidden variable (in this case represented by the activity
potential) of those nodes. Our analysis is complemented by numerical
simulations in order to check theoretical predictions against concrete
examples of activity potential distributions. Using this formalism, we
can demonstrate rigorously that the integrated degree distribution at
time @xmath takes the same functional form as the activity potential
distribution, with the rescaled degree @xmath , in the limit of large
system size @xmath . This is however an asymptotic result, which is well
fulfilled for an activity potential power-law distributed, as
empirically measured in a wide range of social interaction settings, but
fails for simple constant or homogeneous distributions. We also show
that the aggregated social networks show in general disassortative
degree correlations, at odds with the assortative mixing revealed in
real social networks. The clustering coefficient is low, @xmath ,
comparable with a random network.

Secondly, we have studied the time evolution of the connectivity
properties of the integrated network. We have focused in particular in
the onset of the giant component in the aggregated network, defined as
the largest set of connected agents that have established at least one
contact up to a fixed time @xmath . We have been able to provide
analytic expressions for the percolation time @xmath , at which the
onset of the giant component takes place, depending on the details of
temporal network dynamics. Assuming lack of degree correlations in the
initial evolution of the integrated network, the application of the
generating function formalism [ 113 ] allows to obtain an explicit
general form for the temporal percolation threshold, as well as analytic
asymptotic expressions for the size of the giant component in the
vicinity of the threshold. These expressions turn out to be in good
agreement with numerical results for particular forms of the activity
distribution imposing weak degree correlations. For a skewed, power-law
distributed activity @xmath , the uncorrelated results are still
numerically correct for large values of @xmath . When @xmath is small,
however, strong disagreements arise. Applying a percolation formalism
for correlated networks [ 55 ] , we have been able to obtain the exact
threshold @xmath , valid for any kind of activity potential. For @xmath
, the correlated threshold collapses onto the uncorrelated result, which
thus provides a very good approximation to the exact result. For small
@xmath , the percolation threshold as obtained by numerical simulation
of large networks is in very good agreement with the analytical
prediction.

Our study opens interesting direction for future work, in the first
instance concerning the possible modifications of the activity driven
network model, in order to incorporate some properties of real social
networks currently missed, such as a high clustering coefficient,
assortative mixing by degree or a community structure [ 112 ] . A
particularly promising line of investigation regards the possibility of
considering an activity driven model in which the probability to fire
new connections does not follow a Poissonian or periodic process, but it
is driven by a non-Markovian or renewal process. In this case, the model
would incorporate one of the most relevant features of human dynamics,
the burstiness of interactions, represented by a power law distributed
interevent time [ 13 ] . Through the hidden variable formalism and
renewal theory, it is possible to show that the degree distribution of
the aggregated network still displays a broad tailed behavior, whose
exact form depends on the interplay between the renewal process and the
activity potential form. The study of the percolation properties of
integrated temporal networks also opens new interesting venues of future
research, related in particular to the properties of dynamical processes
running on top of them and to the coupling of their different time
scales. One such application in the context of epidemic spreading is the
study of the SIR model, which we have shown can be mapped to a temporal
percolation problem in activity driven networks, thus providing explicit
forms (albeit valid in certain limits of weak degree correlations) for
the size of epidemic outbreaks in this class of systems.

## Part II Dynamical processes on empirical time-varying networks

The traditional approach to the study of dynamical processes on complex
networks considered a time-scale separation between the network
evolution and the dynamical process unfolding on its structure [ 22 ] .
In most cases, the substrate is taken as a static entity, or quenched in
its connectivity pattern, with connections frozen or evolving at a time
scale much longer than the one of the process under study [ 22 , 44 ] .
Researchers have also focused on the opposite limit, in which the
process dynamics are much slower than the network evolution, thus the
interactions among individuals can be replaced by effective random
couplings, equivalent to consider the graph as annealed [ 26 ] . While
time scale separation is extremely convenient for the numerical and
analytical tractability of the models, in many cases of interest the two
timescales are comparable and cannot be decoupled [ 30 , 106 , 122 ] .
The time duration and the co-occurrence of links is crucial. This is
particularly true when the substrate is represented by a social network,
in which connections between individuals are constantly rewired.
Longitudinal data has traditionally been scarce in social network
analysis, but, thanks to recent technological advances, researchers are
now in a position to gather data describing the contacts in groups of
individuals at several temporal and spatial scales and resolutions.

The analysis of empirical data on several types of human interactions
(corresponding in particular to phone communications or physical
proximity) has unveiled the presence of complex temporal patterns in
these systems, [ 72 , 65 , 120 , 34 , 165 , 157 , 103 , 79 , 68 ] . In
particular, the heterogeneity and burstiness of the contact patterns of
human interactions [ 13 ] , as broadly discussed in Chapter 1 ,
stimulated the study of the impact of a network’s dynamics on the
dynamical processes taking place on top of it. The processes studied in
this context include synchronization [ 52 ] , percolation [ 124 , 11 ] ,
social consensus [ 17 ] , or diffusion [ 147 ] . Epidemic-like processes
have also been explored, both using realistic and toy models of
propagation processes [ 140 , 73 , 157 , 79 , 103 , 85 , 122 , 66 , 139
, 101 ] . The study of simple schematic spreading processes over
temporal networks helps indeed expose several properties of their
dynamical structure: dynamical processes can in this context be
conceived as probing tools of the network’s temporal structure [ 79 ] .

In this part of the Thesis, we will uncover the behavior of dynamical
processes running on the top of empirical temporal networks. To this
aim, we consider as typical examples of temporal networks the dynamical
sequences of contact between individuals in various social contexts, as
recorded by the SocioPatterns project [ 167 ] , (see Chapter 1 ). We
will devote our attention to two simple cases of dynamical processes: in
Chapter 4 we address random walks, while Chapter 5 is dedicated to
epidemic spreading. Considering the pivotal role of these processes, we
believe that our understanding could help to shed light on the behavior
of more complex dynamics on temporally evolving networks.

### Chapter 4 Random walks

Random walks are a paradigm of dynamical processes, having a glorious
tradition in statistical physics, and since they lie at the core of many
real-world phenomena, they have been extensively studied in many other
fields, ranging from biology to economics [ 175 , 71 , 99 ] . The random
walk is indeed the simplest diffusion model, and its dynamics provides
fundamental hints to understand the whole class of diffusive processes
on networks. Moreover, it has relevant applications in such contexts as
spreading dynamics (i.e. virus or opinion spreading) and searching. For
instance, assuming that each vertex knows only about the information
stored in each of its nearest neighbors, the most naive economical
strategy is the random walk search, in which the source vertex sends one
message to a randomly selected nearest neighbor [ 4 , 100 , 22 ] . If
that vertex has the information requested, it retrieves it; otherwise,
it sends a message to one of its nearest neighbors, until the message
arrives to its finally target destination. Thus, the random walk
represents a lower bound on the effects of searching in the absence of
any information in the network, apart form the purely local information
about the contacts at a given instant of time.

In this Chapter we will focus on the dynamics of a random walker
unfolding on a temporal network [ 68 ] , represented by the empirical
contact sequence of face-to-face interactions [ 167 ] , presented in
Chapter 1 . In our study, we introduce different randomizing strategies
that allow us to single out the role of the different properties of the
empirical networks, such as the heterogeneity and burstiness of the
social interactions. We will show that the random walk exploration is
slower on temporal networks than it is on the aggregate projected
network, even when the time is properly rescaled. In particular, we
point out that a fundamental role is played by the temporal correlations
between consecutive contacts present in the data. We also address the
consequences of the intrinsically limited duration of many real world
dynamical networks, by considering the reachability of the individuals
when performing a random walk search. Although these results refer to
temporal networks represented by face-to-face social interactions, our
findings, especially regarding the impact of burstiness in slowing down
the dynamics, turn out to be crucial in the study of a wide class of
dynamical processes on temporal networks [ 102 , 91 , 69 ] .

The Chapter is structured as follows. In Sec 4.1 we review some of the
fundamental results for random walks on static networks. In Sec. 4.2 we
recall the datasets used in the study and we introduce suitable
randomization procedures, which will help later on to pinpoint the role
of the correlations in the real data, and we write down mean-field
equations for the case of maximally randomized dynamical contact
networks. In Sec. 4.3 we investigate the random walk dynamics
numerically, focusing on the exploration properties and on the mean
first passage times, while Sec. 4.4 is devoted to the analysis of the
impact of the finite temporal duration of real time series. Finally, we
summarize our results and comment on some perspectives in Sec 4.5 .

#### 4.1 A short overview of random walks on static networks

The random walk (RW) process is defined by a walker that, located on a
given vertex @xmath at time @xmath , hops to a nearest neighbor vertex
@xmath at time @xmath .

In binary networks, defined by the adjacency matrix @xmath (see Chapter
1 ) the transition probability at each time step from @xmath to @xmath
is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the degree of vertex @xmath : the walker hops to a
nearest neighbor of @xmath , chosen uniformly at random among the @xmath
neighbors, hence with probability @xmath (note that we consider here
undirected networks with @xmath , but the process can be considered as
well on directed networks). In weighted networks with a weight matrix
@xmath , the transition probability takes instead the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the strength of vertex @xmath [ 21 ] . Here the walker
chooses a nearest neighbor with probability proportional to the weight
of the corresponding connecting edge.

The basic quantity characterizing random walks in networks is the
occupation probability @xmath , defined as the steady state probability
(i.e., measured in the infinite time limit) that the walker occupies the
vertex @xmath , or in other words, the steady state probability that the
walker will land on vertex @xmath after a jump from any other vertex.
Following rigorous master equation arguments, it is possible to show
that the occupation probability takes the form [ 116 , 178 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

in binary and weighted networks, respectively.

Other characteristic properties of the random walk, relevant to the
properties of searching in networks, are the mean first-passage time
(MFPT) @xmath and the coverage @xmath [ 175 , 71 , 99 ] . The MFPT of a
node @xmath is defined as the average time taken by the random walker to
arrive for the first time at @xmath , starting from a random initial
position in the network. This definition gives the number of messages
that have to be exchanged, on average, in order to find vertex @xmath .
The coverage @xmath , on the other hand, is defined as the number of
different vertices that have been visited by the walker at time @xmath ,
averaged for different random walks starting from different sources. The
coverage can thus be interpreted as the searching efficiency of the
network, measuring the number of different individuals that can be
reached from an arbitrary origin in a given number of time steps.

At a mean-field level, these quantities are computed as follows: let us
define @xmath as the probability for the walker to arrive for the first
time at vertex @xmath in @xmath time steps. Since in the steady state
@xmath is reached in a jump with probability @xmath , we have @xmath .
The MFPT to vertex @xmath can thus be estimated as the average @xmath ,
leading to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

On the other hand, we can define the random walk reachability of vertex
@xmath , @xmath , as the probability that vertex @xmath is visited by a
random walk starting at an arbitrary origin, at any time less than or
equal to @xmath . The reachability takes the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the last expression is valid in the limit of sufficiently small
@xmath . The coverage of a random walk at time @xmath will thus be given
by the sum of these probabilities, i.e.

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

For sufficiently small @xmath , the exponential in Eq. ( 4.6 ) can be
expanded to yield @xmath , a linear coverage implying that at the
initial stages of the walk, a different vertex is visited at each time
step, independently of the network properties [ 155 , 6 ] .

It is now important to note that the random walk process has been
defined here in a way such that the walker performs a move and changes
node at each time step, potentially exploring a new node: except in the
pathological case of a random walk starting on an isolated node, the
walker has always a way to move out of the node it occupies. In the
context of temporal networks, on the other hand, the walker might arrive
at a node @xmath that at the successive time step becomes isolated, and
therefore has to remain trapped on that node until a new link involving
@xmath occurs. In order to compare in a meaningful way random walk
processes on static and dynamical networks, and on different dynamical
networks, we consider in each dynamical network the average probability
@xmath that a node has at least one link. The walker is then expected to
move on average once every @xmath time steps, so that we will consider
the properties of the random walk process on dynamical networks as a
function of the rescaled time @xmath . The values of the mean ratio of
interacting individuals @xmath for each dataset is reported in Table 1.1
, as one can see, these values are far from @xmath , which implies that
the slowing down due to the temporal nature of the network is
considerable and cannot be neglected.

#### 4.2 Synthetic extensions of empirical contact sequences

In this study we use as substrate for the random walks dynamics the
temporal networks representing the face-to-face interactions recorded by
the SocioPatterns collaboration [ 167 ] . In particular, we focus on
data sets measured in several different social contexts: the 2010
European Semantic Web Conference (“eswc”), a geriatric ward of a
hospital in Lyon (“hosp”), the 2009 ACM Hypertext conference (“ht”), and
the 2009 congress of the Société Francaise d’Hygiène Hospitalière
(“sfhh”). A detailed description of the properties of these data sets
has been provided in Chapter 1 , while a broader analysis including a
discussion on experiment setup can be found in [ 34 , 41 , 73 , 158 ,
122 ] .

The empirical contact sequences represent the proper dynamical network
substrate upon which the properties of any dynamical process should be
studied. In many cases however, the finite duration of empirical
datasets is not sufficient to allow these processes to reach their
asymptotic state [ 121 , 157 ] . This issue is particularly important in
processes that reach a steady state, such as random walks. As discussed
in Sec. 4.1 , a walker does not move at every time step, but only with a
probability @xmath , and the effective number of movements of a walker
is of the order @xmath . For the considered empirical sequences, this
means that the ratio between the number of hops of the walker and the
network size, @xmath , assumes values between @xmath for the school case
and @xmath for the eswc case. Typically, for a random walk processes
such small times permit to observe transient effects only, but not a
stationary behavior. Therefore we will first explore the asymptotic
properties of random walks in synthetically extended contact sequences,
and we will consider the corresponding finite time effects in Sec. 4.4 .
The synthetic extensions preserve at different levels the statistical
properties observed in the real data, thus providing null models of
dynamical networks.

Inspired by previous approaches to the synthetic extension of empirical
contact sequences [ 65 , 121 , 157 , 85 , 68 ] , we consider the
following procedures:

-    SRep : Sequence replication. The contact sequence is repeated
    periodically, defining a new extended characteristic function such
    that @xmath . This extension preserves all of the statistical
    properties of the empirical data (obviously, when properly rescaled
    to take into account the different durations of the extended and
    empirical time series), introducing only small corrections, at the
    topological level, on the distribution of time respecting paths and
    the associated sets of influence of each node. Indeed, a contact
    present at time @xmath will be again available to a dynamical
    process starting at time @xmath after a time @xmath .

-    SRan : Sequence randomization. The time ordering of the
    interactions is randomized, by constructing a new characteristic
    function such that, at each time step @xmath , @xmath @xmath and
    @xmath , where @xmath is a time chosen uniformly at random from the
    set @xmath . This form of extension yields at each time step an
    empirical instantaneous network of interactions, and preserves on
    average all the characteristics of the projected weighted network,
    but destroys the temporal correlations of successive contacts,
    leading to Poisson distributions for @xmath and @xmath .

-    SStat : Statistically extended sequence. An intermediate level of
    randomization can be achieved by generating a synthetic contact
    sequence as follows: we consider the set of all conversations @xmath
    in the sequence, defined as a series of consecutive contacts of
    length @xmath between the pair of agents @xmath and @xmath . The new
    sequence is generated, at each time step @xmath , by choosing @xmath
    conversations ( @xmath being the average number of new conversations
    starting at each time step in the original sequence, see Table 1.1
    ), randomly selected from the set of conversations, and considering
    them as starting at time @xmath and ending at time @xmath , where
    @xmath is the duration of the corresponding conversation. In this
    procedure we avoid choosing conversations between agents @xmath and
    @xmath which are already engaged in a contact started at a previous
    time @xmath . This extension preserves all the statistical
    properties of the empirical contact sequence, with the exception of
    the distribution of time gaps between consecutive conversations of a
    single individual, @xmath .

In Fig. 4.1 we plot the distribution of the duration of contacts, @xmath
, and the distribution of gap times between two consecutive
conversations realized by a single individual, @xmath , for the extended
contact sequences SRep, SRan and SStat. One can check that the SRep
extension preserves all the @xmath , @xmath and @xmath distributions of
the original contact sequence, the SRan extension preserves only @xmath
and the SStat extension preserves both the @xmath and the @xmath but not
the @xmath , as summarized in Table 4.1 . Interestingly, we note that
the distribution of gap times for all agents, @xmath , is also broadly
distributed in the SRan and SStat extensions, despite the fact that the
respective individual burstiness @xmath are bounded, see Fig. 4.1 . This
fact can be easily understood by considering that @xmath can be written
in terms of a convolution of the individual gap distributions times the
probability of starting a conversation. In the case of SRan extension,
the probability @xmath that an agent @xmath starts a new conversation is
proportional to its strength @xmath , i.e. @xmath . Therefore, the
probability that it starts a conversation @xmath time steps after the
last one (its gap distribution) is given by @xmath , for sufficiently
small @xmath . The gap distribution for all agents @xmath is thus given
by the convolution

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the strength distribution. This distribution has an
exponential form, as shown in Section 1.2 . This leads, from Eq. ( 4.7
), to a total gap distribution @xmath , with a heavy tail. Analogous
arguments can be used in the case of the SStat extension.

##### 4.2.1 Analytic expressions for the extended sequences

Let us consider a random walk on the sequence of instantaneous networks
at discrete time steps, which is equivalent to a message passing
strategy in which the message is passed to a randomly chosen neighbor.
The walker present at node @xmath at time @xmath hops to one of its
neighbors, randomly chosen from the set of vertices

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

of which there is a number

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

If the node @xmath is isolated at time @xmath , i.e. @xmath , the walker
remains at node @xmath . In any case, time is increased @xmath .

Analytical considerations analogous to those in Sec. 4.1 for the case of
contact sequences are hampered by the presence of time correlations
between contacts. In fact, as we have seen, the contacts between a given
pair of agents are neither fixed nor completely random, but instead show
long range temporal correlations. An exception is represented by the
randomized SRan extension, in which successive contacts are by
construction uncorrelated. Considering that the random walker is in
vertex @xmath at time @xmath , at a subsequent time step it will be able
to jump to a vertex @xmath whenever a connection between @xmath and
@xmath is created, and a connection between @xmath and @xmath will be
chosen with probability proportional to the number of connections
between @xmath and @xmath in the original contact sequence, i.e.
proportional to @xmath . That is, a random walk on the extended SRan
sequence behaves essentially as in the corresponding weighted projected
network, and therefore the equations obtained in Sec. 4.1 , namely

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

apply. In this last expression for the coverage we can approximate the
sum by an integral, i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

being @xmath the distribution of strengths. Giving that @xmath has an
exponential behavior, we can obtain from the last expression

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 4.3 Random walks on extended contact sequences

In this Section we present numerical results from the simulation of
random walks on the extended contact sequences described above.
Measuring the coverage @xmath we set the duration of these sequences to
@xmath times the duration of the original contact sequence @xmath ,
while to evaluate the MFPT between two nodes @xmath and @xmath , @xmath
, we let the RW explore the network up to a maximum time @xmath , time
steps, corresponding to @xmath times the duration of the original
contact sequences. Each result we report is averaged over at least
@xmath independent runs.

##### 4.3.1 Network exploration

The network coverage @xmath describes the fraction of nodes that the
walker has discovered up to time @xmath . Figure 4.2 shows the
normalized coverage @xmath as a function of time, averaged for different
walks starting from different sources, for the dynamical networks
obtained using the SRep, SRan and SStat prescriptions. Time is rescaled
as @xmath to take into account that the walker can find itself on an
isolated vertex, as discussed before. While for SRep and SRan extensions
the average number of interacting nodes @xmath is by construction the
same as in the original contact sequence, for the SStat extension we
obtain numerically different values of @xmath , which we use when
rescaling time in the corresponding simulations.

The coverage corresponding to the SRan extension is very well fitted by
a numerical integration of Eq. ( 4.12 ), which predicts the coverage
@xmath obtained in the correspondent projected weighted network.
Moreover, when using the rescaled time @xmath , the SRan coverages for
different datasets collapse on top of each other for small times, with a
linear time dependence @xmath for @xmath as expected in static networks,
showing a universal behavior.

The coverage obtained on the SStat extension is systematically smaller
than in the SRan case, but follows a similar evolution. On the other
hand, the RW exploration obtained with the SRep prescription is
generally slower than the other two, particularly for the 25c3 and ht
datasets. As discussed before, the original contact sequence, as well as
the SRep extension, are characterized by irregular distributions of the
interactions in time, showing periods with few interacting nodes and
correspondingly a small number @xmath of new started conversations,
followed by peaks with many interactions (see Fig. 4.3 ). This feature
slows down the RW exploration, because the RW may remain trapped for
long times on isolated nodes. The SRan and the SStat extensions, on the
contrary, both destroy this kind of temporal structure, balancing the
periods of low and high activity: the SRan extension randomizes the time
order of the contact sequence, and the SStat extension evens the number
of interacting nodes, with @xmath new conversations starting at each
time step.

The similarity between the random walk processes on the SRan and SStat
dynamical networks shows that the random walk coverage is not very
sensitive to the heterogenous durations of the conversations, as the
main difference between these two cases is that @xmath is narrow for
SRan and broad for SStat. In these cases, the observed behavior is
instead well accounted for by Eq. ( 4.12 ), taking into account only the
weight distribution of the projected network, i.e., the heterogeneity
between aggregated conversation durations. Therefore, the slower
exploration properties of the SRep sequences can be mostly attributed to
the correlations between consecutive conversations of the single
individuals, as given by the individual gap distribution @xmath , (see [
157 , 79 , 85 ] for analogous results in the context of epidemic
spreading).

A remark is in order for the 25c3 conference. A close inspection of Fig.
4.2 shows that the RW does not reach the whole network in any of the
extensions schemes, with @xmath , although the duration of the
simulation is quite long @xmath . The reason is that this dataset
contains a group of nodes (around @xmath of the total) with a very low
strength @xmath , meaning that there are agents who are isolated for
most of the time, and whose interactions are reduced to one or two
contacts in the whole contact sequence. Given that each extension we use
preserves the @xmath distribution, the discovery of these nodes is very
difficult. The consequence is that we observe an extremely slow approach
to the asymptotic value @xmath . Indeed, the mean-field calculations
presented in Secs. 4.1 and 4.2.1 suggest a power-law decay with @xmath
for the residual coverage @xmath .

In Fig. 4.4 we plot the asymptotic coverage for large times in the 4
datasets considered. We can see that RW on the eswc and ht dataset
conform at large times quite reasonably to the expected theoretical
prediction in Eq. ( 4.13 ), both for the SRep and SRan extensions. The
25c3 dataset shows, as discussed above, a considerable slowing down,
with a very slow decay in time. Interestingly, the school dataset is
much faster than all the rest, with a decay of the residual coverage
@xmath exhibiting an approximate exponential decay. It is noteworthy
that the plots for the randomized SRan sequence do not always obey the
mean-field prediction (see lower plot in Fig. 4.4 ). This deviation can
be attributed to the fact that SRan extensions preserve the topological
structure of the projected weighted network, and it is known that, in
some instances, random walks on weighted networks can deviate from the
mean-field predictions [ 19 ] . These deviations are particularly strong
in the case of the 25c3 dataset, where connections with a very small
weight are present.

##### 4.3.2 Mean first-passage time

Let us now focus on another important characteristic property of random
walk processes, namely the MFPT defined in Section 4.1 . Figure 4.5
shows the correlation between the MFPT @xmath of each node, measured in
units of rescaled time @xmath , and its normalized strength @xmath .

The random walks performed on the SRan and SStat extensions are very
well fitted by the mean field theory, i.e. Eq. ( 4.10 ) (predicting that
@xmath is inversely proportional to @xmath ), for every dataset
considered; on the other hand, random walks on the extended sequence
SRep yield at the same time deviations from the mean-field prediction
and much stronger fluctuations around an average behavior. Figure 4.6
addresses this case in more detail, showing that the data corresponding
to RW on different datasets collapse on an average behavior that can be
fitted by a scaling function of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

with an exponent @xmath .

These results show that the MFPT, similarly to the coverage, is rather
insensitive to the distribution of the contact durations, as long as the
distribution of cumulated contact durations between individuals is
preserved (the weights of the links in the projected network).
Therefore, the deviations of the results obtained with the SRep
extension of the empirical sequences have their origin in the burstiness
of the contact patterns, as determined by the temporal correlations
between consecutive conversations. The exponent @xmath means that the
searching process in the empirical, correlated, network is slower than
in the randomized versions, in agreement with the smaller coverage
observed in Fig. 4.2 .

The data collapse observed in Fig. 4.6 for the SRep case leads to two
noticeable conclusions. First, although the various datasets studied
correspond to different contexts, with different numbers of individuals
and densities of contacts, simple rescaling procedures are enough to
compare the processes occurring on the different temporal networks, at
least for some given quantities. Second, the MFPT at a node is largely
determined by its strength. This can indeed seem counterintuitive as the
strength is an aggregated quantity (that may include contact events
occurring at late times). However, it can be rationalized by observing
that a large strength means a large number of contacts and therefore a
large probability to be reached by the random walker. Moreover, the fact
that the strength of a node is an aggregate view of contact events that
do not occur homogeneously for all nodes but in a bursty fashion leads
to strong fluctuations around the average behavior, which implies that
nodes with the same strength can also have rather different MFPT (Note
the logarithmic scale on the y-axis in Fig. 4.6 ).

#### 4.4 Random walks on finite contact sequences

The case of finite sequences is interesting from the point of view of
realistic searching processes. The limited duration of a human
gathering, for example, imposes a constraint on the length of any
searching strategy. Fig. 4.7 ((left) shows the normalized @xmath
coverage as a function of the rescaled time @xmath . The coverage
exhibits a considerable variability in the different datasets, which do
not obey the rescaling obtained for the extended SRan and SStat
sequence. The probability distribution of the time lags @xmath between
the discovery of two new vertices [ 16 ] provides further evidence of
the slowing down of diffusion in temporal networks. The inset of Fig.
4.7 (left) indeed shows broad tailed distributions @xmath for all the
dataset considered, differently from the exponential decay observed in
binary static networks [ 16 ] .

The important differences in the rescaled coverage @xmath between the
various datasets, shown in Fig. 4.7 (left), can be attributed to the
choice of the time scale, @xmath , which corresponds to a temporal
rescaling by an average quantity. We can argue, indeed, that the speed
with which new nodes are found by the RW is proportional to the number
of new conversations @xmath started at each time step @xmath , thus in
the RW exploration of the temporal network the effective time scale is
given by the integrated number of new conversations up to time @xmath ,
@xmath . In the same Fig. 4.7 (right) we display the correlation between
the coverage @xmath and the number of new conversations realized up to
time @xmath , @xmath , normalized for the mean number of new
conversations per unit of time, @xmath . While the relation is not
strictly linear, a very strong positive correlation appears between the
two quantities.

The complex pattern shown by the average coverage @xmath originates from
the lack of self-averaging in a dynamic network. Figure 4.8 shows the
rank plot of the coverage @xmath obtained at the end of a RW process
starting from node @xmath , and averaged over @xmath runs. Clearly, not
all vertices are equivalent. A first explanation of the variability in
@xmath comes from the fact that not all nodes appear simultaneously on
the network at time @xmath . If @xmath denotes the arrival time of node
@xmath in the system, a random walk starting from @xmath is restricted
to @xmath : nodes arriving at later times have less possibilities to
explore their set of influence, even if this set includes all nodes. To
put all nodes on equal footing and compensate for this somehow trivial
difference between nodes, we consider the coverage of random walkers
starting on the different vertices @xmath and walking for exactly @xmath
time steps (we limit of course the study to nodes with @xmath ).
Differences in the coverage @xmath will then depend on the intrinsic
properties of the dynamic network. For a static network indeed, either
binary or weighted, the coverage @xmath would be independent of @xmath ,
as random walkers on static networks lose the memory of their initial
position in a few steps, reaching very fast the steady state behavior
Eq. ( 4.3 ). As the inset of Fig. 4.8 shows, important heterogeneities
are instead observed in the coverage of random walkers starting from
different nodes on the dynamic network, even if the random walk duration
is the same.

Another interesting quantity is the probability that a vertex @xmath is
discovered by the random walker. As discussed in Section 4.1 , at the
mean field level the probability that a node @xmath is visited by the RW
at any time less than or equal to @xmath (the random walk reachability)
takes the form @xmath . Thus the probability that the node @xmath is
reached by the RW at any time in the contact sequence is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the rescaled time @xmath is taken into account. In Fig. 4.9 , we
plot the probability @xmath of node @xmath to be reached by the RW
during the contact sequence as a function of its strength @xmath .
@xmath exhibits a clear increasing behavior with @xmath , larger
strength corresponding to larger time in contact and therefore larger
probabilities to be reached. Interestingly, the simple rescaling by
@xmath and @xmath leads to an approximate data collapse for the RW
processes on the various dynamical networks, showing a very robust
behavior. Similarly to the case of the MFPT on extended sequences, the
dynamical property @xmath can be in part “predicted” by an aggregate
quantity such as @xmath . Strong deviations from the mean-field
prediction of Eq. ( 4.15 ) are however observed, with a tendency of
@xmath to saturate at large strengths to values much smaller than the
ones obtained on a static network. Thus, although the set of sources of
almost every node @xmath has size @xmath , as determined by the large
fraction @xmath of pairs of nodes connected by at least one time
respecting path, shown in Table 1.2 (see Section 1.2.1 ), the
probability for node @xmath to be effectively reached by a RW is far
from being equal to @xmath .

Moreover, rather strong fluctuations of @xmath at given @xmath are also
observed: @xmath is indeed an aggregate view of contacts which are
typically inhomogeneous in time, with bursty behaviors ¹ ¹ 1 When
considering RW on a contact sequence of length @xmath randomized
according to the SRan procedure instead, Eq. ( 4.15 ) is well obeyed and
only small fluctuations of @xmath are observed at a fixed @xmath . .
Figure 4.9 also shows that the reachability computed at shorter time
(here @xmath ) displays stronger fluctuations as a function of the
strength @xmath computed on the whole time sequence: @xmath for shorter
RW is naturally less correlated with an aggregate view which takes into
account a more global behavior of @xmath .

#### 4.5 Summary and Discussion

In this Chapter we have investigated the behavior of random walks on
temporal networks. In particular, we have focused on real face-to-face
interactions concerning four different datasets. Given the finite
life-time of each network, we have considered as substrate for the
random walk process the replicated sequences in which the same time
series of contact patterns is indefinitely repeated. At the same time,
we have proposed two different randomization procedures to investigate
the effects of correlations in the real dataset. The “sequence
randomization” (SRan) destroys any temporal correlation by randomizing
the time ordering of the sequence. This allows to write down exact
mean-field equations for the random walker exploring these networks,
which turn out to be substantially equivalent to the ones describing the
exploration of the weighted projected network. The “statistically
extended sequence” (SStat), on the other hand, selects random
conversations from the original sequence, thus preserving the
statistical properties of the original time series, with the exception
of the distribution of time gaps between consecutive conversations.

We have performed numerical analysis both for the coverage and the MFPT
properties of the random walker. In both cases we have found that the
empirical sequences deviate systematically from the mean field
prediction, inducing a slowing down of the network exploration and of
the MFPT. Remarkably, the analysis of the randomized sequences has
allowed us to point out that this is due uniquely to the temporal
correlations between consecutive conversations present in the data, and
not to the heterogeneity of their lengths. Finally, we have addressed
the role of the finite size of the empirical networks, which turns out
to prevent a full exploration of the random walker, though differences
exist across the four considered cases. In this context, we have also
shown that different starting nodes provide on average different
coverages of the networks, at odds to what happens in static graphs. In
the same way, the probability that the node @xmath is reached by the RW
at any time in the contact sequence exhibits a common behavior across
the different time series, but it is not described by the mean-field
predictions for the aggregated network, which predict a faster process.

In conclusion, the contribution of the analysis presented in this
Chapter is two-fold. On the one hand, we have proposed a general way to
study dynamical processes on temporally evolving networks, by the
introduction of randomized benchmarks and the definition of appropriate
quantities that characterize the network dynamics. On the other hand,
for the specific, yet fundamental, case of the RW, we have obtained
detailed results that clarify the observed dynamics, and that will
represent a reference for the understanding of more complex diffusive
dynamics occurring on dynamic networks. Our investigations also open
interesting directions for future work. For instance, it would be
interesting to investigate how random walks starting from different
nodes explore first their own neighborhood [ 18 ] , which might lead to
hints about the definition of “temporal communities” (see e.g. [ 132 ]
for an algorithm using RW on static networks for the detection of static
communities); various measures of nodes centrality have also been
defined in temporal networks [ 27 , 164 , 95 , 121 , 68 ] , but their
computation is rather heavy, and RW processes might present interesting
alternatives, similarly to the case of static networks [ 114 ] .

### Chapter 5 Epidemic spreading

The topology of the pattern of contacts between individuals plays a
fundamental role in determining the spreading patterns of epidemic
processes [ 82 ] . The first predictions of classical epidemiology [ 7 ,
81 ] were based on the homogeneous mixing hypothesis, assuming that all
individuals have the same chance to interact with other individuals in
the population. This assumption and the corresponding results were
challenged by the empirical discovery that the contacts within
populations are better described in terms of networks with a non-trivial
structure [ 112 ] . Subsequent studies were devoted to understanding the
impact of network structure on the properties of the spreading process.
The main result obtained concerned the large susceptibility to epidemic
spread shown by networks with a strongly heterogeneous connectivity
pattern, as measured by a heavy-tailed degree distribution @xmath [ 127
, 98 , 110 , 179 ] .

The study of spreading patterns on networks is naturally complemented by
the formulation of immunization strategies tailored to the specific
topological properties of each network. Optimal strategies shed light on
how the role and importance of nodes depend on their properties, and can
yield importance rankings of nodes. In the case of static networks, this
issue has been particularly stimulated by the fact that heterogeneous
networks with a heavy-tailed degree distribution have a very large
susceptibility to epidemic processes, as represented by a vanishingly
small epidemic threshold. In such networks, the simplest strategy
consisting in randomly immunizing a fraction of the nodes is
ineffective. More complex strategies, in which nodes with the largest
number of connections are immunized, turn out to be effective [ 128 ]
but rely on the global knowledge of the network’s topology. This issue
is solved by the so-called acquaintance immunization [ 38 ] , which
prescribes the immunization of randomly chosen neighbors of randomly
chosen individuals. In the temporal networks field, few works have
addressed the issue of the design of immunization strategies and their
respective efficiency [ 93 , 163 , 161 , 101 ] . In particular, [ 93 ]
consider datasets describing the contacts occurring in a population
during a time interval @xmath ; they define and study different
strategies that use information from the interval @xmath to decide which
individuals should be immunized in order to limit the spread during the
remaining time @xmath . Using a large @xmath , the authors show that
some tailored strategies, based on the contact patterns, perform better
than random immunization and show that this is related to the temporal
correlations of the networks.

In this Chapter, we study the dynamics of a simple spreading process
running on top of empirical temporal networks. In particular, we
investigate the effect of several immunization strategies, including the
ones considered by [ 93 ] , and address the issue of the length @xmath
of the “training window”, which is highly relevant in the context of
real-time, specific tailored strategies. The scenario we have in mind is
indeed the possibility to implement a real-time immunization strategy
for an ongoing social event, in which the set of individuals to be
immunized is determined by strategies based on preliminary measurements
up to a given time @xmath . The immunization problem takes thus a
two-fold perspective: The specific rules (strategy) to implement, and
the interval of time over which preliminary data are collected.
Obviously, a very large @xmath will lead to more complete information,
and a more satisfactory performance for most targeting strategies, but
it incurs in the cost of a lengthy data collection. On the other hand, a
short @xmath will be cost effective, but yield a smaller amount of
information about the observed social dynamics.

In order to investigate the role of the training window length on the
efficiency of several immunization strategies, we consider a simple
snowball susceptible-infected (SI) model of epidemic spreading or
information diffusion [ 7 ] . In this model, individuals can be either
in the susceptible (S) state, indicating that they have not been reached
by the “infection” (or information), or they can be in the infectious
(I) state, meaning that they have been infected by the disease (or that
they have received the information) and can further propagate it to
other individuals. Infected individuals do not recover, i.e., once they
transition to the infectious state they remain indefinitely in that
state. Despite its simplicity, this model has indeed proven to provide
interesting insights into the temporal structure and properties of
temporal networks. Here we focus on the dynamics of the SI model over
empirical time-varying social networks. The networks we consider
describe time-resolved face-to-face contacts of individuals in different
environments and were measured by the SocioPatterns collaboration (see
Chapter 1 ). We consider the effect on the spread of an SI model of the
immunization of a fraction of nodes, chosen according to different
strategies based on different amounts of information on the contact
sequence. We find a saturation effect in the increase of the efficiency
of strategies based on nodes characteristics when the length of the
training window is increased. The efficiency of strategies that include
an element of randomness and are based on temporally local information
do not perform as well but are largely independent on the amount of
information available.

The Chapter is organized as follows: In Sec. 5.1 we define the spreading
model and some quantities of interest. The immunization strategies we
consider are listed in Sec. 5.2 . Section 5.3 contains the main
numerical results, and we discuss in Sec. 5.3.1 and Sec. 5.3.2 the
respective effects of temporal correlations and of randomness effects in
the spreading model. Section 5.4 finally concludes with a discussion of
our results.

#### 5.1 Epidemic models and numerical methods

Here we present the results of numerical simulation of the
susceptible-infected (SI) spreading dynamics on the empirical data of
human face-to-face proximity. The process is initiated by a single
infected individual (“seed”). At each time step, each infected
individual @xmath infects with probability @xmath the susceptible
individuals @xmath with whom @xmath is in contact during that time step.
The process stops either when all nodes are infected or at the end of
the temporal sequence of contacts.

Different individuals have different contact patterns and a priori
contribute differently to the spreading process. In order to quantify
the spreading efficiency of a given node @xmath , we proceed as follows:
We consider @xmath as the seed of the SI process, all other nodes being
susceptible. We measure the half prevalence time, i.e., the time @xmath
needed to reach a fraction of infected nodes equal to @xmath of the
population. Since not all nodes appear simultaneously at @xmath of the
contact sequence, we define the half-infection time of seed node @xmath
as @xmath , where @xmath is the time at which node @xmath first appears
in the contact sequence. The half-infection time @xmath can thus be seen
as a measure of the spreading power of node @xmath : smaller @xmath
values correspond to more efficient spreading patterns. We first focus
on the deterministic case @xmath (the effects of stochasticity, as given
by @xmath , are explored in Sec. 5.3.2 ). Figure 5.1 (left) shows the
rank plot of the rescaled half-infection times @xmath for various
datasets, where @xmath is the duration of the contact sequence. We note
that @xmath is quite heterogeneous, ranging from @xmath up to @xmath ¹ ¹
1 We note that defining @xmath as the time needed to reach a different
fraction of the population, such as e.g. @xmath , leads to a similar
heterogeneity. .

Some nodes are therefore much more efficient spreaders than others. This
implies that the immunization of different nodes could have very
different impacts on the spreading process. To estimate this impact, we
define for each node @xmath the infection delay ratio @xmath as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the half-infection time obtained when node @xmath is the
seed of the spreading process and node @xmath is immunized, and the
ratio is averaged over all possible seeds @xmath and over different
starting times for the SI process (as the half-infection time is
typically much smaller than the total duration of the contact sequence,
@xmath ) ² ² 2 Note that in some cases, node @xmath is not present
during the time window in which the SI process is simulated; in this
case, @xmath . . The infection delay ratio @xmath quantifies therefore
the average impact that the immunization of node @xmath has on SI
processes unfolding over the temporal network. Individuals with large
@xmath have a high impact in delaying the infection propagation and
should be immunized, while individuals with low @xmath will have a
marginal impact in slowing down the spreading if immunized. Figure 5.1
(right) displays a rank plot of @xmath for various datasets. As
expected, the immunization of a single node does most often lead to a
limited delay of the spreading dynamics. Interestingly however, @xmath
is broadly distributed and large values are also observed.

The infection delay ratio of a single node @xmath , @xmath , can be
generalized to the case of the immunization of any set of nodes @xmath ,
with @xmath . We measure the spreading slowing down obtained when
immunizing the set @xmath through the infection delay ratio

  -- -- -- -------
           (5.2)
  -- -- -- -------

where @xmath is the half-infection times of node @xmath when all the
nodes of set @xmath are immunized, and the average is performed over all
possible seeds @xmath and over different starting times for the SI
process.

In addition to slowing down the propagation process, the immunization of
certain individuals can also block the spreading paths towards other,
non-immunized, individuals, limiting in this way the final number of
infected individuals. We measure this effect through the average
outbreak size ratio

  -- -- -- -------
           (5.3)
  -- -- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath are the final numbers of infected individuals
(outbreak size) for an SI process with seed @xmath , with and without
immunization of the set @xmath , respectively. The ratio is averaged
over all possible seeds @xmath and over different starting times of the
SI process.

#### 5.2 Immunization strategies

An immunization strategy is defined by the choice of the set @xmath of
nodes to be immunized. We define here different strategies, and we
compare their efficiency in section 5.3 by measuring @xmath and @xmath .
More precisely, for each contact sequence of duration @xmath we consider
an initial temporal window @xmath over which various node properties can
be measured. A fraction @xmath of the nodes, chosen according to
different possible rules, is then selected and immunized (it forms the
set @xmath ). Finally, @xmath and @xmath are computed by simulating the
SI process with and without immunization and averaging over starting
seeds and times. For each selection rule, the two relevant parameters
are @xmath and @xmath . Larger fractions @xmath are naturally expected
to lead to larger @xmath and @xmath . Here we also consider the effect
of @xmath , where a larger @xmath corresponds to a larger amount of
information on the contact sequence. We investigate whether and how more
information about the contact sequence yields a higher efficiency of the
immunization strategy.

We consider the following strategies (or “protocols”):

-   Degree protocol. We immunize the @xmath individuals with the highest
    aggregated degree in @xmath [ 128 ] ; the aggregated degree of an
    individual @xmath corresponds to the number of different other
    individuals with whom @xmath has been in contact during @xmath ;

-   Betweennness centrality protocol. We immunize the @xmath individuals
    with the highest betweenness centrality measured on the aggregated
    network in @xmath [ 67 ] ;

-   Acquaintance protocol. We choose randomly an individual and immunize
    one of his contacts in @xmath , chosen at random, repeating the
    process until @xmath individuals are immunized [ 38 ] ;

-   Weight protocol. We choose randomly an individual and immunize his
    most frequent contact in @xmath , repeating the process until @xmath
    individuals are immunized [ 93 ] ;

-   Recent protocol. We choose randomly an individual and immunize his
    last contact in @xmath , repeating the process until @xmath
    individuals are immunized [ 93 ] .

As a benchmark, we also consider the following two strategies:

-   Random protocol. We immunize @xmath individuals chosen randomly
    among all nodes;

-   @xmath -protocol. We immunize the @xmath individuals with the
    highest @xmath , where the values of @xmath are calculated according
    to Eq. ( 5.1 ) in the interval @xmath .

The Rn strategy uses no information about the contact sequence and we
use it as a worst case performance baseline. The T strategy makes use,
through the quantity @xmath , of the most complete information available
in the interval considered, since it takes into account the average
effect of node immunization on SI processes taking place over the
contact sequence. It could thus be expected to yield the best
performance among all strategies.

The A , W , R and Rn strategies involve a random choice of individuals.
In these cases, we therefore average the results over @xmath independent
runs (each run corresponding to an independent choice of the immunized
individuals).

#### 5.3 Numerical results

We first study the role of the temporal window @xmath on the efficiency
of the various immunization strategies. To this aim, we consider two
values of the fraction of immunized individuals, @xmath and @xmath , and
compute the infection delay ratio @xmath as a function of @xmath for
each immunization protocol and for each dataset. Considering the limited
duration of the contact sequence, we simulate the spreading dynamics
over the whole sequence @xmath , and not only over the remaining part
@xmath . The results, displayed in Figs. 5.2 and 5.3 , show that an
increase in the amount of information available, as measured by an
increase in @xmath , does not necessarily translate into a larger
efficiency of the immunization, as quantified by the delay of the
epidemic process. The , and protocols have in all cases lower
efficiencies that remain almost independent on @xmath . Moreover, and in
contrast with the results of [ 93 ] on a different dataset, and do not
perform better than . On the other hand, the immunization efficiency of
the , and protocols increases at small @xmath and reaches larger values
for all the datasets. As expected, the Rn protocol, which does not use
any information, fares the worst. For @xmath , all protocols yield an
infection delay ratio that is largely independent of @xmath for large
enough training windows @xmath . For @xmath , the increase of @xmath is
more gradual but tends to saturate for @xmath as well. In all cases, a
limited knowledge of the contact time series is therefore sufficient to
estimate which nodes have to be immunized in order to delay the
spreading dynamics, especially for small @xmath , i.e., in case of
limited resources. Interestingly, in some cases, the and protocols lead
to a larger delay of the spread than the protocol, despite the fact that
the latter is explicitly designed to identify the nodes which yield the
maximal (individual) infection delay ratio. This could be ascribed to
correlations between the activity patterns of nodes, leading to a
non-linear dependence on @xmath of the immunization efficiency (in
particular, the list of nodes to immunize is built using the list of
degrees, betweenness centralities, and @xmath values computed on the
original network, without recomputing the rankings each time a node is
immunized, i.e., effectively removed from the network).

Figure 5.4 reports the outbreak ratio @xmath as a function of the
temporal window @xmath for different immunization protocols. Results
similar to the case of the infection delay ratio are recovered: the
reduction in outbreak size, as quantified by the average outbreak size
ratio defined in Eq. ( 5.3 ), reaches larger values for the degree,
betweenness centrality and protocols than for the , and protocols.

We finally investigate the robustness of our results when the fraction
of immunized individuals varies. To this aim, we use a fixed length
@xmath for the training window and we plot the infection delay ratio
@xmath and the average outbreak size ratio @xmath as a function of
@xmath , respectively, in Figs. 5.5 and 5.6 . The results show that the
ranking of the strategies given by these two quantities is indeed robust
with respect to variations in the fraction of immunized individuals. In
particular, the and protocols perform much better than the and protocols
for at least one of the efficiency indicators.

##### 5.3.1 Effects of temporal correlations

Real time-varying networks are characterized by the presence of bursty
behavior and temporal correlations, which impact the unfolding of
dynamical processes [ 65 , 87 , 73 , 115 , 11 , 68 , 147 ] . For
instance, if a contact between vertices @xmath and @xmath takes place
only at the (discrete) times @xmath , it cannot be used in the course of
a dynamical processes at any time @xmath . A propagation process
initiated at a given seed might therefore not be able to reach all the
other nodes, but only those belonging to the seed’s set of influence [
65 ] , i.e., those that can be reached from the seed by a time
respecting path.

In order to investigate the role of temporal correlations, we consider a
reshuffled version of the data in which correlations between consecutive
interactions among individuals are removed. To this aim, we consider the
list of events @xmath describing a contact between @xmath and @xmath at
time @xmath and reshuffle at random their timestamps to build a
synthetic uncorrelated new contact sequence, as done in the study of the
random walks process with the “SRan” randomization. We then apply the
same immunization protocols to this uncorrelated temporal network.

Figure 5.7 displays the corresponding results for the infection delay
ratio @xmath computed for SI spreading simulations performed on a
randomized dataset (similar results are obtained for the average
outbreak size ratio @xmath ). We have checked that our results hold
across different realizations of the randomization procedure. The
efficiency of the protocol is then largely independent of the training
window length. As the contact sequence is random and uncorrelated, all
temporal windows are statistically equivalent, and no new information is
added by increasing @xmath : in particular, as nodes appear in the
randomly reshuffled sequence with a constant probability that depends on
their empirical activity, the ranking of nodes according for instance to
their aggregated degree remains very stable as @xmath changes, so that a
very small @xmath is enough to reach a stable ranking. Nevertheless, the
efficiency ranking of the different protocols is unchanged: the degree,
betweenness centrality, and protocols outperform the other immunization
strategies. Moreover, the efficiency levels reached are higher than for
the original contact sequence: the correlations present in the data
limit the immunization efficiency in the case of the present datasets.
Note that studies of the role of temporal correlations on the speeding
or slowing down of spreading processes have led to contrasting results,
as discussed by [ 101 ] , possibly because of the different models and
dataset properties considered.

##### 5.3.2 Non-deterministic spreading

We also verify the robustness of our results using a probabilistic SI
process with @xmath . We consider the same immunization strategies and
we compute the same quantities as in the case @xmath . Given the
probabilistic nature of the spreading process, we now average the above
observables over @xmath realizations of the SI process. Figure 5.8 shows
that our results hold in the case of a probabilistic spread, although in
this case the infection delay ratio @xmath presents a noisy behavior,
due to the stochastic fluctuations of the spreading dynamics. The
average outbreak ratio @xmath , not shown, behaves in a very similar
way. Thus, also in this more realistic case with @xmath , a limited
knowledge of the contact sequence is enough to identify which
individuals to immunize.

#### 5.4 Summary and Discussion

Within the growing body of work concerning temporal networks, few
studies have considered the issue of immunization strategies and of
their relative efficiency. In general terms, the amount of information
that can be extracted from the data at hand about the characteristics of
the nodes and links is a crucial ingredient for the design of optimal
immunization strategies. Understanding how much information is needed in
order to design good (and even optimal) strategies, and how the
efficiency of the strategies depend on the information used, remain
largely open questions whose answers might depend on the precise dataset
under investigation.

We have here leveraged several datasets describing contact patterns
between individuals in various contexts and performed simulations in
order to measure the effect of different immunization strategies on
simple SI spreading processes. We have considered immunization
strategies designed according to different principles, different ways of
using information about the data, and different levels of randomness.
Strategies range from the completely random to the , and strategies that
include a random choice, to the fully deterministic , and that are based
on various node’s characteristics. Moreover, uses only local information
while and rely on the global knowledge of the connection patterns. The
most efficient strategies, as measured by the changes in the velocity of
the spread and in the final number of nodes infected, are the
deterministic protocols, namely and . Strategies based on random
choices, even when they are designed in order to try to immunize
“important” nodes, are less efficient.

We have moreover investigated how the performance of the various
strategies depends on the time window on which the nodes’
characteristics are measured. A longer time window corresponds indeed a
priori to an increase in the available information and hence to the
possibility to better optimize the strategies. We have found, however, a
clear saturation effect in the efficiency increase of the various
strategies as the training window on which they are designed increases.
This is particularly the case when the fraction of immunized individuals
is small (Fig. 5.2 ), for which a small @xmath is enough to reach
saturation, while the saturation is more gradual for larger fractions of
immunized (Fig. 5.3 ). The emergence of a saturation timescale is
noteworthy as it is unexpected in such a system in which broad
distributions of contacts and inter-contact times are observed and no
characteristic timescale can be defined [ 34 ] . Finally, the strategies
that involve a random component yield results that are largely
independent on the amount of information considered.

In order to understand these results in more details, we have considered
the evolution with time of the nodes’ properties. In particular, we
compare the nodes with the largest degree in the fully aggregated
network with the set of nodes @xmath chosen by following the strategy on
the training window @xmath . To this aim, we show in Fig. 5.9 the median
of the degrees, in the fully aggregated network, of the nodes of @xmath
, as a function of @xmath . The median rapidly reaches its final value,
showing that, even for short @xmath , the set of immunized nodes @xmath
has properties (here the degree) similar to the ones of the set @xmath
that would be obtained by taking into account the whole dataset of
length @xmath .

Figure 5.10 moreover displays the evolution of the degree aggregated
over the training window @xmath , as a function of @xmath , for several
nodes. The top 5% of nodes with the largest degree in the fully
aggregated network are ranked among the most connected nodes already for
small training windows @xmath . The top 20% of the ranking fluctuates
more and takes longer to stabilize. Overall, while the precise ordering
scheme of the nodes according to their degree is not entirely stable
with respect to increasing values of @xmath , a coarse ordering is
rather rapidly reached: the nodes that reach a large degree at the end
of the dataset are rapidly ranked among the highest degree nodes, and
the nodes that in the end have a low degree are as well rapidly
categorized as such. This confirms the result of Fig. 5.9 and explains
why the strategy reaches its best efficiency even at short training
windows for small @xmath , and with a more gradual saturation for larger
fractions of immunized nodes.

The fact that high degree nodes are identified early on in the
information collection process comes here as a surprise: for a temporal
network with Poissonian events, all the information on the relative
importance of links and nodes is present in the data as soon as the
observation time is larger than the typical timescale of the dynamics;
this is however a priori not the case for the bursty dynamics observed
in real-world temporal networks, for which no characteristic timescale
can be defined. Various factors can explain the observed stability in
the ranking of nodes. In first instance, some nodes can possess some
intrinsic properties giving them an important a priori position in the
network (for instance, nurses in a hospital, or senior scientists in a
conference) that ensure them a larger degree than other nodes even at
short times. Secondly, the stability of the ranking could in fact be
only temporary, and due to the fact that nodes arriving earlier in the
dataset have a larger probability to gather a large number of contacts.
In this case, the observed stability of the ordering scheme might
decrease on longer timescales. In order to be able to discriminate
between these possibilities, datasets extending on much longer
timescales would however need to be collected.

The main conclusion of our study is therefore twofold. On the one hand,
a limited amount of information on the contact patterns is sufficient to
design relevant immunization strategies; on the other hand, the strong
variation in the contact patterns significantly limits the efficiency of
any strategy based on importance ranking of nodes, even if such
deterministic strategies still perform much better than the “recent” or
“weight” protocols that are generalizations of the “acquaintance”
strategy. Moreover, strategies based on simple quantities such as the
aggregated degree perform as well as or better than strategies based on
more involved measures such as the infection delay ratio defined in Sec.
5.1 . We also note that, contrarily to the case investigated by [ 93 ] ,
the “recent” and “weight” strategies, which try to exploit the temporal
structure of the data, do not perform better than the simpler
“acquaintance” strategy. Such apparent discrepancy might have various
causes. In particular, [ 93 ] consider spreading processes starting
exactly at @xmath while we average over different possible starting
times. The datasets used are moreover of different nature ( [ 93 ]
indeed obtain contrasted results for different datasets) and have
different temporal resolutions. A more detailed comparison of the
different datasets’ properties would be needed in order to fully
understand this point, as discussed for instance by [ 101 ] .

### Chapter 6 Conclusions and future perspectives

Data revolution in social science revealed complex patterns of
interactions in human dynamics, such as heterogeneity and burstiness of
social contacts. The recently uncovered temporal dimension of social
interactions, indeed, calls for a renewed effort in analysis and
modeling of empirical time-vaying networks. I contributed to pursue this
program with the work presented in this thesis, focusing on a twofold
track: Modeling of dynamical social systems and the study of the impact
of temporally evolving substrates on dynamical processes running on top
of them, addressed in part I and part II , respectively. Below a general
summary of such a work is given, including perspectives for future work,
for more specific considerations see the concluding sections of each
Chapter.

Firstly, in Chapter 1 we introduced some basic concepts and definitions
of the time-varying networks formalism, and we presented some empirical
data of social dynamics, discussing their main features. We showed that
the scientific collaboration networks [ 108 ] present a temporal
dimension that can be used to define the concept of activity potential,
discussed more in detail later in Chapter 3 . We also analyzed the main
statistical properties of the face-to-face interactions networks,
recorded by the the SocioPatterns collaboration, such as the bursty
dynamics of social interactions, revealed by the heavy tailed form of
the distributions of contact duration between pairs of individuals and
gap times between consecutive interactions. These empirical data of
human contact networks have been largely used in the rest of the thesis,
since they constitute the benchmark for developing the modeling effort
presented in Chapter 2 , as well as the substrate on which dynamical
processes considered in part II take place. Recently, a lot of attention
has been devoted to the study of multi-layered or multiplex networks.
Real complex systems, indeed, are often composed of several layers of
interrelated networks, in which the same actors interact between them on
different layers. Social networks, among the others, seem to be
particularly appropriate to be described as multiplex, since social
interactions between the same individuals can occur in different
contexts or mediated by different means, such as face-to-face versus
online communication. Up to date, however, the great majority of works
has dealt with the theoretical study of static multiplex, while little
or no attention has been given to the empirical analysis of real
multi-layered networks. This is a promising perspective for future work
on temporal networks, it would be particularly interesting to consider
the burstiness of human dynamics on different layers of interactions,
and the effect of the correlation between the different time series on
diffusion processes.

In the first part of the thesis we focused on modeling of social
dynamics, with a twofold aim: reproduction of empirical data properties
and analytic treatment of the models considered. In Chapter 2 we
presented and discussed the behavior of a simple model able to replicate
the main statistical properties of empirical face-to-face interactions,
at different levels of aggregation, such as individual, group and
collective scales. The model considers individuals involved in a social
gathering as performing a random walk in space, and it is based on the
concept of social “attractiveness”: socially attractive people (due to
their status or role in the gathering) are more likely to make people
stop around them, so they start to interact. Interestingly, the
remarkable agreement between the model and experimental data is robust
with respect to variations of the internal parameters of the model. The
fact that the attractiveness model is able to reproduce the collective
dynamics of the individuals, as shown with the reachability in the
random walk case, is promising for the forthcoming study of dynamical
processes, such as a spreading of information or diseases, taking place
on the temporal networks produces by the model. Moreover, the key role
of the concept of social attractiveness in the model definition
naturally encourages further empirical research in this direction, in
order to deepen the relation between the individual’s attractiveness and
his behavior in the social gathering, revealed by the number and
duration of his interactions.

Chapter 3 has been devoted to the analytic study of the activity-driven
model, aimed to capture the relation between the dynamics of
time-varying networks and the topological properties of their
corresponding aggregated social networks. Through a mapping to a hidden
variables formalism, we obtained analytic expressions for several
topological properties of the time-integrated networks, as a function of
the integration time and the form of the activity potential. We also
explored the connectivity properties of the evolving network, as
revealed by the giant connected component size and the percolation
threshold, for both cases of uncorrelated and correlated networks,
finding notable differences. Despite the success of the activity driven
model in explaining the formation of hubs and the scale free form of the
degree distribution, our analysis revealed that several topological
properties of real social networks are still missing in the present
formulation of the model, opening directions for its possible
extensions. In particular, preliminary studies showed that the model
remains analytically tractable if the probability to fire new
connections is ruled by a renewal process. This non-Markovian model
would be able to reproduce the heavy tailed form of the inter-event time
distribution, one of the most striking features currently missing in the
original activity driven model.

In the second part of the thesis we studied the behavior of diffusive
processes taking place on temporal networks, constituted by empirical
face-to-face interactions data. In Chapter 4 we considered random walks,
the simplest diffusion model and a paradigm of dynamical processes,
since its behavior provides fundamental insights on more complex
diffusive processes. Thanks to different randomization strategies we
introduced, we were able to single out the crucial role of temporal
correlations in slowing down the random walk exploration. Our results
contribute to shed light on the dynamics of random walks, and represent
a reference for the study of general dynamical processes unfolding on
temporal networks. Future work along this line of research will be
devoted to the investigation of the behavior of a random walker moving
on top of a multi-layered network, such as a social network constituted
by a communication layer and a physical layer. Particular attention will
be dedicated to the study of the impact of the temporal correlation
between the layers on the random walk exploration and the network
navigability.

Finally, Chapter 5 dealt with spreading dynamics, focusing on the case
of a simple SI model taking place on temporal networks. We complemented
the study of the epidemic spreading by investigating the impact of
different immunization strategies, in order to reduce and delay the
infection outbreak. We addressed in particular the effect of the length
of the temporal window used to gather information in order to design the
immunization strategy, finding that a limited amount of information of
the contact patterns is sufficient to identify the individuals to
immunize so to maximize the effect of the vaccination protocol.
Moreover, our results indicate that strategies based on simple
quantities such as the individual’s aggregated degree perform as well as
complex strategies more difficult to implement. Spreading dynamics have
been recently studied on top of multiplex [ 58 ] . In the scenario
considered, an epidemic process is taking place on a layer of physical
contacts, while information awareness regarding the disease is spreading
on the communication layer involving the same individuals. The interplay
between the two processes is analyzed under a theoretical point of view,
revealing the effect of the interrelation with the awareness process on
the epidemic threshold. These findings prompt for further studies, aimed
to compare theoretical predictions with the results of spreading
dynamics on empirical multi-layered networks, and to study the impact of
the temporal dimension on the phase diagram of the epidemics incidence.
