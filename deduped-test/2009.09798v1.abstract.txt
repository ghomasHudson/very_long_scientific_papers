The thesis showcases the importance of tomograms in quantifying nonclassical
effects such as wavepacket revivals, squeezing, and quantum entanglement in
continuous-variable, hybrid quantum, and qubit systems. This approach avoids
error-prone statistical methods used in state reconstruction procedures. The
performance of many bipartite entanglement indicators obtained directly from
tomograms is examined both in the case of known quantum states and experimental
data reported in the literature.
