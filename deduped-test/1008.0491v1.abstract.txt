This thesis covers various aspects of open systems in classical and quantum
mechanics. In the first part, we deal with classical systems. The
bath-of-oscillators formalism is used to describe an open system, and the
phenomenological Langevin equation is recovered. The Fokker-Planck equation is
derived from its corresponding Langevin equation. The Fokker-Planck equation
for a particle in a periodic potential in the high-friction limit is solved
using the continued-fraction method. The equilibrium and time-dependent
solutions are obtained. Under strong periodic driving, we observe significant
non-linear effects in the dynamical hysteresis loops. Shapiro steps appear in
the time-average of the drift velocity curves. Similar study is carried out for
a dipole in an electric field.
  In the second part of the thesis, we begin the study of open quantum systems
by re-deriving the quantum master equation using perturbation theory. The
master equation is then applied to the bath-of-oscillators model. The
subtleties and approximations of the master equation are discussed. We then use
the master equation to solve the damped harmonic oscillator. The equilibrium
solution coincides with the canonical distribution. The steady state response
to DC and AC forces is also studied. Driven systems are more challenging in
quantum open systems, and we manage to solve the quantum master equation with
the continued-fraction method. We obtain the frequency-dependent susceptibility
curves, which exhibit typical absorption and dispersion profiles.
