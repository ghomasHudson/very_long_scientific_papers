I give an overview of some of the most used measures of entanglement. To
make the presentation self-contained, a number of concepts from quantum
information theory are first explained. Then the structure of bipartite
entanglement is studied qualitatively, before a number of bipartite
entanglement measures are described, both for pure and mixed states.
Results from the study of multipartite systems and continuous variable
systems are briefly discussed.
