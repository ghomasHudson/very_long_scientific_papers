We consider the possibility that the unification of the electroweak
interactions and the strong force arises from string theory, at energies
significantly lower than the string scale. As a tool, an effective grand
unified field theory in six dimensions is derived from an anisotropic
orbifold compactification of the heterotic string. It is explicitly
shown that all anomalies cancel in the model, though anomalous Abelian
gauge symmetries are present locally at the boundary singularities. In
the supersymmetric vacuum additional interactions arise from
higher-dimensional operators. We develop methods that relate the
couplings of the effective theory to the location of the vacuum, and
find that unbroken discrete symmetries play an important role for the
phenomenology of orbifold models. An efficient algorithm for the
calculation of the superpotential to arbitrary order is developed, based
on symmetry arguments. We furthermore present a correspondence between
bulk fields of the orbifold model in six dimensions, and the moduli
fields that arise from compactifying four internal dimensions on a
manifold with non-trivial gauge background.
