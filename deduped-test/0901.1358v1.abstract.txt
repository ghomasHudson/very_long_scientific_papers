Anisotropic states at half-filled third and higher Landau levels are
investigated in the system with a finite electric current. We study the
response of the striped Hall state and the anisotropic charge density wave
(ACDW) state against the injected current using the effective action. Current
distributions and a current dependence of the total energy are determined for
both states. With no injected current, the energy of the ACDW state is lower
than that of the striped Hall state. We find that the energy of the ACDW state
increases faster than that of the striped Hall state as the injected current
increases. Hence, the striped Hall state becomes the lower energy state when
the current exceeds the critical value. The critical value is estimated at
about 0.04 - 0.05 nA which is much smaller than the current used in the
experiments. Our calculations are performed using a block diagonalization
technique on a von Neumann lattice. We review this technique in this thesis.
