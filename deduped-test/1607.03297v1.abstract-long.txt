This thesis determines some of the implications of non-universal and
emergent universal statistics on arithmetic correlations and
fluctuations of arithmetic functions, in particular correlations amongst
prime numbers and the variance of the expected number of prime numbers
over short intervals are generalised by associating these concepts to
@xmath -functions arising from number theoretic objects.

Inspired by work in quantum chaology, which shares the property of
displaying emergent universality, in chapter @xmath a heuristic is given
to determine the behaviour of a correlation function associated to
functions in the Selberg class from the universal form of the @xmath
-point correlation statistic conjectured for this class. Also in this
chapter, the Riemann zeta function is taken as an example of an @xmath
-function from which the correlations between pairs of prime numbers
arise from a non-universal form of the @xmath -point correlation
statistic for its zeros. Chapter @xmath explores the implications of the
@xmath -point correlation statistic on an arithmetic variance associated
to functions in the Selberg class, generalising the variance of primes
in short intervals. Many of the ideas in this thesis are based on the
paper, [ BKS16 ] , joint with Hung Bui and Jon Keating.
