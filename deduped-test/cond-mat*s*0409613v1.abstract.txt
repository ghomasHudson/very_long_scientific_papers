In this thesis we examine methodologies for determining free energy
differences (FEDs) of phases via Monte Carlo simulation. We identify and
address three generic issues that arise in FED calculations; the choice of
representation, the choice of estimator, and the choice of sampling strategy.
In addition we discuss how the classical framework may be extended to take into
account quantum effects.
