## Chapter 1 Introduction

In the standard quantum field theory, space-time is treated as a
continuum that can be described mathematically as a differentiable
manifold. While this approach gives an adequate picture of space-time at
large length scales, there is no evidence that this description should
hold to arbitrarily small scales. In fact, the continuum description
leads to divergences that plague ordinary quantum field theory. While
physical quantities can be calculated despite the divergences using
renormalization theory, ordinary quantum field theory cannot be
considered as a complete description of fundamental physics. These
divergences provide a signal that the continuum description of
space-time should be replaced by some new structure at short distances
of the order of Planck length @xmath , where quantum gravitational
effects, if nothing else, should modify the concept of space-time. The
most prominent candidate for the UV completion of continuum quantum
field theory is string theory. In string theory the point-particle
description of quantum field theory is replaced by vibrating strings
which provide an effective minimal length given by the string length.
Another approach to the UV physics is to keep the quantum field
description of particles but instead replace the space-time manifold
itself by some structure that exhibits a minimal length. This is the
underlying idea in noncommutative quantum field theory (NC QFT) where
the smeared nature of space-time is obtained by replacing the space-time
coordinates by a noncommutative algebra.

Noncommutative algebra is an old concept in mathematics and it is
familiar to physicists from its natural appearance in various physical
contexts such as nonabelian symmetry groups and quantum mechanics. In
quantum mechanics, the classical position and momentum variables are
replaced by operators @xmath and @xmath in a Hilbert space, that satisfy
the canonical commutator algebra @xmath . Points in the classical
configuration or momentum space correspond to eigenvalues of the
operators @xmath or @xmath , respectively, but since the coordinate and
momentum operators do not commute, they do not share the same
eigenstates and thus the points in the classical phase-space get smeared
out. The study of such quantum spaces was pioneered by von Neumann,
whose studies led to the theory of von Neumann algebras and to the birth
of ”noncommutative geometry”, in which the study of spaces is done
purely in algebraic terms [ 1 ] .

The generalization of the canonical commutators of quantum mechanics to
nontrivial commutators between the coordinate operators was suggested by
Heisenberg [ 2 ] . The first published paper on the subject [ 3 ] is by
H. S. Snyder who proposed an algebra of the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a parameter that defines the basic unit of length and
@xmath are the generators of the Lorentz group. Snyder’s space-time is
symmetric under Lorentz transformations but not under translations.
Later, the formulation was modified by C. N. Yang [ 4 ] in order to
achieve full Poincaré invariance. The motivating idea in Snyder’s work
was to eliminate the ultraviolet divergences arising in quantum field
theory by making the space-time pointless on small length scales.
However, due to the success of the renormalization program that was
being developed at around the same time, Snyder’s approach did not
become popular.

The mathematical study of noncommutative geometry was revived in the
1980’s most notably by Connes, Woronowicz and Drinfel’d, who generalized
the notion of differential structure to the noncommutative setting [ 5 ]
. The development of differential calculus in noncommutative geometry
gave rise to physical applications such as Yang-Mills theory on NC torus
[ 6 ] and the Connes-Lott model [ 7 ] based on Kaluza-Klein mechanism
where the extra dimensions are replaced by noncommutative structures.
The aim of the Connes-Lott model is to obtain a geometrical
interpretation for the fields and various parameters in the Standard
Model.

More concrete motivation for space-time noncommutativity came more
recently from the work of Doplicher, Fredenhagen and Roberts who
combined the quantum mechanical uncertainty principle between
coordinates and momenta with the classical Einstein’s gravity theory [ 8
] . This results in a limit on the accuracy by which space-time
measurements can be performed and thus ordinary space-time loses
operational meaning at very short distances. It turns out the
uncertainty relations can be described by a non-vanishing commutator for
the coordinates,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

The right hand side of ( 1.2 ) is a tensor operator that commutes with
the coordinates and leads to uncertainty relations between the
coordinates similar to the Heisenberg uncertainty relations of quantum
mechanics.

Another impetus to the study of noncommutative field theory came from
string theory. As it was shown by Seiberg and Witten in [ 9 ] , if the
endpoints of open strings are confined to propagate on a @xmath -brane
in a constant @xmath -field background, then the endpoints live
effectively on noncommutative space whose coordinates satisfy the
commutation relations

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a constant matrix. The dynamics of the open strings in
the low energy limit is then described by NC QFT. In this approach
@xmath is a constant parameter that leads to breaking of
Lorentz-invariance in the NC space-time.

One of the characteristic properties in the study of noncommutative
physics is the apparent lack of guiding principles. The vague hints
coming from quantum gravity (string theory) and the classical gravity
argument of Doplicher et al. leave a huge freedom when postulating the
properties and principles of the NC space-time and field theory in it.
For this reason, there is also a lot of controversy in fundamental
issues such as: How is the NC space-time defined? Can the breaking of
Lorentz invariance be allowed? Can the Lorentz-invariant causality
condition be violated and if so, what should it be replaced with? These
controversies are salient also in the works that comprise this thesis.
Although the present day formulations of field theory in NC space suffer
from severe problems that make them unlikely candidates for a realistic
realization of the idea of NC space-time, they still offer valuable toy
models due to the relatively simple changes that are required on
ordinary quantum field theory tools. The field theories on NC space is
the main object of study in this thesis.

The three publications presented in this thesis encompass various
aspects of NC quantum field theory ranging from fundamental properties
of NC space-time physics to gauge theories and phenomenological model
building on the NC space-time. In the introductory part of this thesis
we review some essential results in NC quantum field theory, at the same
time placing the included papers in their proper context. In chapter 2
we review the basic formulation of field theories in NC space-time and
discuss perturbative aspects of such theories. In chapter 3 we review
some essential properties of QFT in NC space-time including the issue of
space-time symmetries, going also beyond the standard formulation of NC
space-time that is based on the constant parameter of noncommutativity.
Especially, we consider Lorentz invariant formulation of NC field theory
and the problems that such theories posses as was shown in the paper III
. In chapter 4 we review some aspects of NC gauge theories and model
building. Gauge theories in NC space-time obey a no-go theorem that
restrains model building in this context. In the paper II a way to
circumvent the no-go theorem was considered. This widens the
possibilities of NC model building and was used in the construction of
NC MSSM in I .

## Chapter 2 Quantum field theory on NC space-time

In this chapter we will review the presentation of fields on NC
space-time using Weyl symbols and the corresponding Moyal *-product.
This technique was introduced by Weyl in ordinary quantum mechanics,
providing a mapping from functions of the phase space to quantum
operators [ 10 ] . In NC space-time this approach provides a convenient
way to study field theories. For the general theory of *-products and
deformation quantization, see [ 11 ] and references therein. More recent
developments can be found in [ 12 , 13 ] .

### 2.1 Fields in NC space-time and the *-product

In this section we follow the exposition given in the review paper [ 14
] . Consider the commutative algebra of complex-valued functions in
Euclidean @xmath . The functions are assumed to satisfy the Schwarz
condition

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which guarantees a rapid decrease at infinity. This condition allows for
the functions to be described by their Fourier transforms. The
noncommutative space is defined by replacing the coordinates @xmath by
operators @xmath obeying the commutation relations

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

For now we are assuming that @xmath is an antisymmetric matrix of real
constant elements, and refer to this case as the canonical
noncommutative space-time . The noncommutative coordinates @xmath
generate an algebra of noncommutative operators. Given a function with
the Fourier transform

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

we define the corresponding Weyl operator by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here the exponential function is defined by its expansion with symmetric
ordering. This correspondence provides a mapping between operators and
fields and the field @xmath is called the Weyl symbol of the operator
@xmath . The mapping can be written explicitly using the Hermitian
operator

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

A set of derivatives can be introduced through linear anti-Hermitian
derivations satisfying

  -- -- -- -------
           (2.6)
  -- -- -- -------

From this definition it follows upon integration by parts that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

and also that translation generators can be represented by unitary
operators

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

This implies that any cyclic trace has the property that Tr @xmath is
independent of @xmath . Therefore the trace is uniquely given by an
integration over space-time,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the trace has been normalized so that Tr @xmath . This implies
that the trace plays a role of integration over noncommuting
coordinates. Using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

one obtains

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Since @xmath is assumed to be an invertible matrix, the Gaussian
integrations over @xmath and @xmath can be performed. The result is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

In particular, it follows using the trace normalization and antisymmetry
of @xmath , that the operators @xmath for @xmath form an orthonormal
set,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

This implies that the transformation from @xmath to @xmath is invertible
with the inverse transform given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore, the map @xmath provides a one-to-one correspondence between
fields and Weyl operators.

Using ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.1 ) one can deduce that the mapping is an
isomorphism if the product between the functions of @xmath is given by
the Moyal *-product:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

An alternative representation for the *-product can be derived using (
2.5 ), ( 2.12 ) and ( 2.13 ),

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.16)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

The *-product is associative but noncommutative, and it provides a
realization of the noncommutative algebra in terms of functions on
ordinary space-time. Especially, we note that the *-product realizes the
commutator ( 2.1 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

Due to the correspondence between the operator trace and space-time
integration the integral of the *-product,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

is invariant under cyclic permutation of the functions @xmath . We note
also that in the case of two fields,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

which follows upon integration by parts.

The *-product imposes nonlocality into products of fields. If the fields
@xmath and @xmath are supported over a small region of size @xmath ,
then @xmath is non-vanishing over a region of size @xmath [ 15 ] . For
example, two point sources described by Dirac delta functions get
infinitely spread due to the *-product:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

This nonlocality has significant consequences on perturbative field
theory.

### 2.2 Field theory and quantization

Let us start by considering the noncommutative version of the @xmath
scalar field theory. In this chapter we assume that time and space
commute; subtleties arising from nonvanishing commutator between time
and space will be discussed in the next chapter. The action for the
noncommutative fields is given by the trace of the noncommutative
Lagrangian,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

This action can be rewritten in terms of the Weyl symbols using the
formulae of the previous section:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

Note that due to the property ( 2.19 ), the part of the action
corresponding to a free theory is equivalent to its commutative
counterpart. From here we can proceed with the quantization by the usual
path integral procedure. The bare propagator is unchanged, but the
interaction term receives a noncommutative modification. To read off the
expression for the interaction vertex, we write the interaction term’s
Fourier expansion,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Here the interaction vertex is given by the phase factor

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

One of the most peculiar new effects in noncommutative quantum field
theory is the mixing of ultraviolet and infrared degrees of freedom that
arises in perturbative calculations [ 15 ] . This effect shows the
nonlocality of NC field theories that is reminiscent of a similar
property of strings. Let us consider the one loop mass renormalization
in the @xmath theory. Taking @xmath , the Euclidean action reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

The one-loop correction to the 1-particle irreducible two point function
can be conveniently divided into the planar and nonplanar parts:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.26)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

The planar diagram is proportional to the standard commutative
contribution with UV divergence and can be computed using the Schwinger
parametrization:

  -- -------- -------- -- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath         (2.27)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- --------

The phase factor in the nonplanar diagram acts effectively as a cutoff,
yielding,

  -- -------- -------- -- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath         (2.28)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- --------

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Note that the nonplanar part remains finite when @xmath . However, the
ultraviolet divergence is restored in the limit @xmath which is achieved
either by taking the commutative limit or the IR limit @xmath . By
taking first @xmath to zero one recovers the standard mass
renormalization,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

With nonzero @xmath the correction assumes a complicated form that
cannot be attributed to any mass renormalization. The UV ( @xmath ) and
IR ( @xmath ) limits obviously do not commute, which shows a curious
mixing between the low and high energy dynamics. The pole in the
nonplanar loop at @xmath comes from the high momentum region of
integration as @xmath .

UV/IR mixing is a general NC effect that affects also NC gauge theories,
where both quadratic and linear poles appear [ 16 ] . Supersymmetry
cancels these poles at least at one loop level, but typically
logarithmic divergences persist. The UV/IR mixing is a perturbative
effect that seems to spoil renormalizability. As a counterexample, a
noncommutative scalar field theory that has the property of being
renormalizable was constructed in [ 17 ] . In this model the
renormalizability is obtained by introducing into the action a harmonic
term that makes the theory covariant under duality transformation
between coordinates and momenta. The harmonic term obviously breaks
translational invariance, but progress towards a translational invariant
formulation that preserves renormalizability and renormalizable NC gauge
field theories has been made, see [ 18 ] and references therein.

As the previous example in the noncommutative Euclidean space-time
illustrates, noncommutativity itself is not enough to remove
UV-divergences in perturbation theory and the naive expectation that
noncommutativity might regularize the divergences is not fulfilled.
However, since the short-distance effects are related to long-distance
features, topological restrictions can change the convergence properties
[ 19 ] . In fact, while in the case of classical space-time the theories
on a sphere or cylinder have UV-divergences, the theories in the fuzzy
sphere [ 20 , 21 ] and quantum cylinder [ 19 ] do not have divergences
at all due to the compactness properties of the spaces. In any case, the
mixing between long and short distance physics is an interesting new
property on its own behalf and it implies that the introduction of
space-time noncommutativity indeed brings novel and exciting ingredients
into quantum field theories.

### 2.3 Approaches towards finite range NC

The UV/IR mixing effect resembles the situation in ordinary quantum
mechanics where large distance phenomena in half of the phase space
coordinates (the momenta) are related to short distance phenomena in the
other coordinates (spatial position). The infrared divergence can be
thought of as a signal of the nonlocality in space extending to infinite
range.

An improvement to this situation could thus be obtained even in a fully
noncompact space if the nonlocality could be restricted to a finite
range ¹ ¹ 1 The discussion presented in this section is based on an
ongoing work by the author with Anca Tureanu and Masud Chaichian. . It
should be remembered that the Moyal product ( 2.1 ) is not the only
*-product realization of the noncommutative algebra and at least some
nonlocal effects could depend on the choice of the product. The Moyal
product was obtained by working in the Weyl basis ( 2.3 ) with symmetric
ordering. Choosing for example the coherent state basis, the *-product
is given by the Wick-Voros product

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here we have restricted the space-time to two dimension s for simplicity
and denoted

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

Calculating the free propagator for a scalar field theory defined with
the Wick-Voros product seems to lead to an apparent improvement in the
UV-behaviour of the theory. However, it turns out that the improvement
does not persist when interaction amplitudes are calculated [ 19 ] . For
a more recent study of the Wick-Voros product in NC QFT, see [ 22 ] .

A naive way to improve the situation could be to simply modify the
*-product in order to cut off the nonlocal phenomena at large enough
distances. For this aim it is useful to write the *-product in the
integral representation,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath indicates the Moyal *-product. The integral gets
contributions from @xmath and @xmath for all values of @xmath and @xmath
. Now different ways to impose a cutoff to the integral can be
considered, resulting in different modified *-products. A Gaussian
cutoff gives (restricting to a plane for simplicity)

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath               (2.33)
                       @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

and the step function leads to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath               (2.34)
                       @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

For the @xmath -product one can check explicitly that it satisfies the
properties

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

Thus it realizes the proper commutator for NC coordinates and provides a
new factor in the product of two plane waves that could act as a cutoff
for UV-physics. However, from ( 2.36 ) one can easily deduce that the
product is not associative and thus it can not be used to replace the
Moyal *-product in NC field theory. If nonassociativity can be dealt
with in the field theory, the *-products with cutoff could be used to
study the physical implications of finite nonlocality.

An alternative approach to finite range NC was developed in [ 23 ] . The
authors considered a noncommutative space-time where the commutator of
coordinates of two distinct points have a compact support, vanishing if
the points are far apart. This leads to a *-product which reduces to the
ordinary product for fields in points whose separation is outside the
support of @xmath . The authors were unable to construct an interacting
field theory in this approach, and further development in this direction
is still lacking.

Finally, we note that the nonlocal effects in NC field theory can be
completely removed by allowing the parameter of noncommutativity to be
composed of fermionic parameters [ 24 ] . If the parameter of
noncommutativity is taken in the bifermionic form, @xmath , where @xmath
are Grassmann odd, the series expansion of the *-product terminates at
finite order. In this framework the modifications to the commutative
model are rather mild and renormalizability properties are improved
compared to the usual NC theories [ 25 ] . This formulation provides an
interesting version of noncommutativity to be studied further.

## Chapter 3 Symmetries of NC space-time and general properties of NC
QFT

### 3.1 Symmetries of constant @xmath

The commutation relation ( 2.1 ) provides a structure that has to be
preserved under symmetry transformations of the space-time. Thus the
symmetry of the NC space-time is given by the subgroup of the Poincaré
group that is the stability group of the antisymmetric tensor @xmath .
The stability group that preserves the commutation relation in four
dimensional space-time is given by @xmath combined with translations [
26 , 27 ] and the physical effect of @xmath is similar to a background
field that provides preferred directions in space-time.

The symmetry of space-time has profound consequences in field theory,
since the particles are representations of the space-time symmetry
group. Violation of Lorentz symmetry also leads to important
phenomenological effects that provide ways to detect the physical
consequences of noncommutativity experimentally. Such Lorentz-violating
effects could be observed for example as diurnal variation of scattering
cross sections and polarization dependent speed of light [ 28 , 29 , 30
, 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 ] . From the lack of evidence for
such phenomena, bounds on the scale of noncommutativity can be derived.
Especially, the vacuum birefringence phenomenon poses very restrictive
bounds on @xmath when compared with cosmological observations unless
supersymmetry arguments are invoked; see [ 38 ] and I .

A different point of view to space-time symmetries in NC quantum field
theory is obtained by considering the symmetries in the context of
quantum groups. It was realized in [ 39 ] that noncommutative space-time
with the Moyal *-product is symmetric under the action of the twisted
Poincaré symmetry that is obtained by twisting the Hopf algebra
structure of the Lie algebra of the ordinary Poincaré group.

In the standard case the Lie algebra structure of Poincaré
transformations is given by the commutators

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.1)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

and the coproduct for all generators is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

The idea behind the twist is to change the coproduct while leaving the
algebra itself unchanged. Choosing the Abelian twist

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

one obtains for the generators of the Lorentz algebra the deformed
coproduct

Due to the commutativity of the @xmath ’s the coproduct of the
translation generators is left unchanged by the twist. Basically, the
Hopf algebra structure of a group defines how the group acts on products
of representations. If the coproduct is changed, it has implications
also on the product of representations. Consider as the representation
space the algebra of functions in Minkowski space, with

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

In the case of ordinary Poincaré Hopf-algebra the product in the
representation algebra is the commutative pointwise product:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then the new product for the representation of the twisted Hopf algebra
is obtained from the requirement

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , the Poincaré algebra. The new associative product @xmath
is defined by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

which guarantees that it satisfies the Leibniz rule ( 3.6 ). The twisted
product @xmath is exactly the Moyal *-product ( 2.1 ). An important
feature of the twisted Poincaré transformations is that they leave the
commutator @xmath invariant, thus keeping @xmath nontransforming, and in
this sense the twisted Poincaré algebra is a symmetry of the NC
space-time.

An important consequence follows from the fact that the representation
content of the twisted symmetry group is exactly identical with the
non-twisted group. Thus, even though ordinary Poincaré symmetry is not a
symmetry of the theory, all particles should sit on the representations
of the Poincaré group, justifying the use of the usual representations
that has been widely adopted in the study of noncommutative field
theories. Thus the twisted Poincaré algebra offers a firm framework for
the proofs of the NC version of results such as the CPT, spin-statistics
and the Haag theorems [ 40 ] .

It should be noted that covariance of the *-product can be obtained
alternatively by considering coordinate transformations under which also
@xmath transforms. For references and comparison with the
twist-approach, see [ 41 ] .

On what comes to the possible further implications of the twisted
space-time symmetry, there seems to be controversy in the field. In [ 42
, 43 ] the authors argue that also the product of the fields’ Fourier
modes should be affected by the twist, resulting in a modified
oscillator algebra. One implication of this approach is that the action
of a NC field theory reduces to the commutative action. Then the effect
of noncommutativity is seen only in the modified statistics of fields [
43 ] . These results were however argued to be false in [ 44 , 45 ] . We
conclude the review of the twist deformed symmetry by noting that the
twisted space-time symmetry in NC field theory is an active area of
study where final conclusive understanding seems to be still lacking.
For a recent survey on these issues see [ 45 ]

#### 3.1.1 Curved NC space-time and NC gravity

As the very idea of noncommutativity stems from the deeper structure of
space-time, presumably relevant at Planck’s scale, it is natural to try
to implement also gravitational physics and general relativity into the
NC QFT setting. A large amount of work can be found in the literature
approaching the problem from different points of view [ 46 , 47 , 48 ,
52 , 53 , 49 , 50 , 51 , 54 , 55 ] . It is notable that the
noncommutative gauge transformations are related to space-time
transformations implying a possible deep connection between NC gauge
symmetry and gravity. In [ 47 ] it was noted that the noncommutative
analogue of @xmath gauge theory can be interpreted as a commutative U(1)
gauge theory coupled to gravity, where the curved metric arises from
noncommutativity. This type of emergent gravity theories have been
further studied in [ 52 , 53 ] relating the gravity theory to matrix
model formulation of noncommutative gauge theory.

Other attempts to generalize the NC field theories from flat NC
space-time to a more general case have been considered in the
literature. An obvious way towards general covariant field theory action
is provided by replacing the space-time derivatives in the *-products by
covariant derivatives [ 48 ] . This replacement however leads to
nonassociative *-product.

In [ 50 ] the authors noted that @xmath is left invariant under a
special subset of general coordinate transformations. This invariance
allows one to construct the unimodular version of gravity in NC
space-time. In [ 50 ] the action for NC unimodular gravity was computed
up to second order in @xmath , using the Seiberg-Witten map. More
recently, a noncommutative gravity based on gauging the noncommutative
analogue of the @xmath symmetry was developed in [ 55 ] .

Approaches towards NC gravity theory using the idea of twisted symmetry
have been developed in [ 49 , 54 ] . Generalization of the twisted
Poincaré symmetry to twisted diffeomorphisms lead the authors of [ 49 ]
to a NC general relativity theory. This approach, however, has been
criticized as it is not consistent with the most strict formulation of
the gauge principle [ 56 ] . In [ 54 ] a similar approach was taken, but
now with a consistent implementation of the gauge principle. This type
of covariantization of the twist leads to nonassociativity as can be
anticipated from the results in [ 48 ] .

### 3.2 Lorentz-invariant formulation of NC space-time

An alternative to the canonical formulation with the constant parameter
of noncommutativity is to consider @xmath as an element of the algebra
that transforms as a Lorentz tensor. Then the possible values of @xmath
provide six degrees of freedom in addition to the four coordinates
@xmath . This approach is similar to the one taken in the seminal paper
of Doplicher, Fredenhagen and Roberts [ 8 ] . Now the structure of the
NC space-time is given by the DFR-algebra

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (3.8)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- -------

The last equation follows from the Jacobi identity and the other two
equations.

Due to the commutativity of @xmath , the algebra of noncommutative
fields can be realized using the Moyal *-product ( 2.1 ) just as in the
case of canonical noncommutativity. Now choosing a state where the
operator @xmath takes an exact value corresponds to the usual Moyal
space-time or, in the case of @xmath , to the commutative space-time. A
more general state leads to a range of different values for @xmath and
the trace of noncommutative field operators is now given by a space-time
integral of their *-products appended with an integral over the values
of @xmath corresponding to the chosen state. Although the approach is
completely Lorentz covariant, Lorentz invariance is lost by choosing a
state that optimizes the uncertainty relations arising from ( 3.8 ).
Since the space of the possible values of @xmath that satisfy the
uncertainty relations proposed in [ 8 ] does not allow for a Lorentz
invariant average, the best one could do is a rotation invariant theory.

The step proposed by Carlson, Carone and Zobin [ 57 ] was to extend the
integral to all values of @xmath in @xmath and put the details of the
state into an unknown weight function @xmath ¹ ¹ 1 Originally Carlson et
al. derived their theory from the NC space-time of Snyder [ 3 ] . A
restatement of their construction in terms of the DFR-algebra was given
in [ 58 ] . ² ² 2 An explicit example of the weight function is
introduced in [ 59 ] . :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

If @xmath is chosen to be a Lorentz scalar, this construction leads to
Lorentz-invariant noncommutative field theory. One important consequence
is the absence of Lorentz violating phenomena such as vacuum
birefringence. This allows for the scale of noncommutativity to be
relatively low and noncommutative effects could be significant already
much below the Planck scale. For example, an experimental bound on
@xmath arising from Lorentz-invariant NC corrections to Bhabha
scattering, dilepton and diphoton production leads to the rather
permissive bound [ 60 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

As was shown in III the Lorentz-invariant theories have significant
problems related to unitarity and causality. These issues are explained
in the rest of this chapter.

### 3.3 Unitarity

From the start, the foundational basic properties of NC quantum field
theories such as unitarity and causality have been under extensive study
in the literature, both in the axiomatic field theory approach and in
more practical calculations in specific models. Due to the lack of
Lorentz invariance, theories with different values of @xmath can have
very different properties. Especially, time-space noncommutativity seems
to induce various difficulties in NC theories, that are absent in the
case of vanishing @xmath .

#### 3.3.1 Unitarity in the canonical case

It has been realized that unitarity is violated in quantum field theory
if time and space do not commute [ 61 ] while such problem does not
generally appear if only @xmath components are allowed to be nonzero. In
[ 61 ] the optical theorem was checked. For a one loop two-point
function in @xmath theory the optical theorem is expressed by the
cutting rule given in Fig. 3.1 .

It was shown that the cutting rule is satisfied provided

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

In Minkowski space the inequality is satisfied in general only if @xmath
, implying violation of unitarity in theories with noncommuting time.

Unlike theories with @xmath , field theories with noncommutative time
can not be obtained as an approximate description of a limit of string
theory. The @xmath case is obtained in string theory in the presence of
a background electric field. However, while it is possible to find a
limit with nonvanishing @xmath where the closed strings decouple, it is
not possible to decouple massive open string states while keeping @xmath
finite [ 62 , 63 ] . Therefore, unitarity of the corresponding string
theory can not be used as an argument for the unitarity of the @xmath
QFT.

On the other hand, starting from a Hermitian Lagrangian one should
obtain a unitary perturbation theory through the standard quantization
procedures. In fact it was realized soon that in the case of
noncommuting time, the time-ordered perturbation theory (TOPT) that one
obtains in the Hamiltonian formulation of perturbation theory does not
reduce to the covariant perturbation theory with the noncommutative
analogues of the usual Feynman rules [ 64 , 65 ] . The time-ordering in
the @xmath -matrix

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

leads initially to graphs with specific time-ordering of the vertices.
In the usual QFT the time-ordered diagrams can be rewritten in a
Lorentz-covariant form by combining the time-ordered propagators to
covariant Feynman propagators. Now if there are time derivatives in the
*-products inside the interaction Hamiltonian, the time-ordering clashes
with the *-product in such a way that the usual covariantization is not
possible.

This explains why the naive use of covariant perturbation theory can
lead to nonunitary results in the case of noncommuting time, as it is
not equivalent to the manifestly unitary Hamiltonian formulation of
perturbation theory. However, even if one works with the TOPT, one
encounters problems with unitarity when considering gauge theories [ 66
] . Thus resorting to the time-ordered perturbation theory can not be
considered as a solution to the unitarity problem.

#### 3.3.2 Unitarity in the Lorentz-invariant case

Perturbative unitarity in the case of the Lorentz-invariant formulation
of NC field theory has been studied in [ 67 ] and III . In [ 67 ] the
unitarity issue was addressed by studying the optical theorem in a
one-loop calculation in @xmath -theory. The calculation was done in the
covariant perturbation theory approach and the result confirmed the
unitarity in such theory at one loop level.

This result leads to the question whether time-ordered and covariant
perturbation theories could be equivalent in the Lorentz-invariant NC
QFT. This, however, turns out not to be true. In III a simple tree-level
amplitude in a Lorentz-invariant NC scalar field theory, described by
the action

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

was calculated both in TOPT and in covariant perturbation theory. The
TOPT amplitude obtained from the sum of the time-ordered diagrams,
depicted in Fig. 3.2, turns out to be inequivalent to the amplitude
obtained from covariant perturbation theory. The discrepancy is due to
the contributions arising upon integration over the @xmath components;
if @xmath were kept fixed to 0, the TOPT and covariant expressions would
coincide. Thus the Lorentz invariant integration over @xmath does not
cancel the harmful contributions arising from time-space components of
@xmath .

Due to this result, the generalization of unitarity to a general
Lorentz-invariant NC field theory seems doubtful and thus one should
rely on the time-ordered formulation in order to obtain manifestly
unitary perturbation theory. However, as already mentioned, even in the
TOPT approach unitarity seems to be lost in physical theories that
include gauge fields.

### 3.4 Causality

In a Lorentz invariant theory the requirement of causality means that
all events that are causally connected preserve their time-ordering in
all inertial frames. In other words, only time-like or light-like
separated events are allowed to be causally connected. In quantum field
theory, this is often expressed in terms of microscopical causality
condition which means that the commutator of local densities of
observables can be nonvanishing only if they are evaluated in points
that are time-like or light-like separated, i.e. one point resides
inside or on the light-cone originating from the other point. The
inherent nonlocality in noncommutative theories presumably brings
modifications to the causality properties of field theory and will be
discussed in this section.

#### 3.4.1 Causality in the canonical case

As the Lorentz symmetry is reduced to @xmath in the presence of nonzero
constant @xmath , the light-cone causality condition is modified to the
light wedge which is invariant under the symmetry group. This can be
seen by considering the commutator of two observables [ 68 , 69 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

Observables (more strictly speaking, the local densities of observables)
are in general constructed by taking local products of fields. In the
noncommutative theory this corresponds to *-products of fields. As a
simple example observable one can consider e.g. @xmath , where the
normal ordering is assumed in order to simplify the calculation. The
*-product in the definition of the local observable is a source for
nonlocality even if @xmath is taken to be a free field.

For our purposes it is enough to consider a single matrix element of the
operator, e.g.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

To evaluate ( 3.15 ) one simply inserts the standard expansion of the
free scalar field in terms of creation and annihilation operators. This
results in [ 68 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.16)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Here @xmath . Obviously the r.h.s. is nonzero only when @xmath ,
implying loss of causality in the presence of time-space
noncommutativity. By the symmetry of the @xmath case, the causality
condition is given by the light wedge when time and space commute.
Similar result was obtained also in a different approach in [ 69 ] ,
where the commutator of Heisenberg fields in two points was considered.
Then noncommutative effects arise only when interactions are taken into
account, and the light wedge was shown to arise in a perturbative
one-loop calculation.

#### 3.4.2 Causality in the Lorentz-invariant case

In the Lorentz invariant case the causality condition, ie. the domain of
validity of the equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

should be Lorentz invariant. Thus one may entertain the hope of a
light-cone causality condition. However, the integration over @xmath in
the noncommutative action brings contributions from all values of the
noncommutativity parameter and thus one might expect nonlocality to
spread infinitely in all directions. The causality issue was
investigated in III by calculating the commutator of two observables
located in different space-time points following the analysis of [ 68 ]
. In the Lorentz invariant theory the local observables should have no
Lorentz-violating @xmath -dependence and thus they should also include
the @xmath -integration:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

The result,

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

exhibits the infinite nonlocality of the theory as the matrix element is
in general nonvanishing for all @xmath for reasonable weight functions
@xmath , including the Gaussian.

The mixing between short and long distance degrees of freedom can be
understood in terms of the modified causality condition. Due to infinite
propagation speed all distances can be correlated and as we have seen,
in the Lorentz-invariant case causality is violated in all directions
and thus the UV/IR mixing is expected to appear. Choosing @xmath in the
Gaussian form, the @xmath -integration effectively replaces the
oscillating phase factors in loop diagrams by Lorentz-invariant Gaussian
damping factors [ 58 , 67 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a parameter describing the scale of noncommutativity.
Despite this modification, IR singularity still arises as the external
momentum goes to zero. However, it was argued in [ 58 ] that the problem
may be avoided by a suitably chosen IR limit under which @xmath goes to
zero with the external momentum. In any case, lack of causality is a
problem that cannot be dismissed and it is necessary to find a way to
restore the light-cone causality in order to achieve a consistent
Lorentz-invariant NC field theory.

### 3.5 Exact NC QFT

Most of the study of NC QFT has been done in the Lagrangean approach.
Attempts to generalize the results of axiomatic approach to quantum
field theory have been also made in the literature. In the canonical NC
case with constant @xmath , some of the postulates of the usual
axiomatic QFT, such as Lorentz symmetry have to be replaced by other
postulates. The first step towards axiomatic NC QFT was taken in [ 27 ]
, where the usual Wightman functions were investigated taking @xmath as
the symmetry group, and the validity of the CPT theorem was shown. From
the point of view of the reconstruction theorem [ 70 ] this formulation
would lead to a ordinary QFT with the symmetry group @xmath . In order
to make the axiomatic formulation genuinely noncommutative, in [ 71 ] an
alternative definition for the NC Wightman functions was proposed with
generalized *-products inserted between the fields:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.21)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

With the @xmath several noncommutative analogues of familiar results of
axiomatic QFT have been proven. The CPT and spin-statistics theorems
were proven in [ 71 ] . Analytical properties of scattering amplitudes
were studied in [ 72 , 73 ] and it was shown in [ 72 ] the results are
sensitive to the form of the causality condition. If the causality
condition is taken to be defined by the light wedge, the NC theory
suffers from a severe lack of analyticity and reduces the predictive
power of the theory. On the other hand, a causality condition of the
form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

that exhibits nonlocality of finite range, is actually equivalent to the
usual causality condition of the commutative theory according to an old
result of Wightman-Vladimirov-Petrina [ 74 ] . In this case analyticity
properties similar to the commutative case would be obtained as argued
in [ 72 ] . We emphasize that the causality condition obtained in the
Lorentz-invariant NC QFT studied in III does not fall into this category
as there the nonlocality is infinite. To obtain a causality condition
with finite nonlocality a new approach is needed as discussed in Section
2.3.

## Chapter 4 NC gauge theories and model building

Due to the local nature of gauge transformations, noncommutativity
introduces profound changes in NC gauge field theories. These changes
and their consequences in model building have been an intensive area of
study during the recent years. In this chapter various approaches to
treating NC gauge symmetries and subsequent construction of particle
physics models based on NC QFT are reviewed.

### 4.1 Gauge theories in NC space-time

#### 4.1.1 The NC no-go theorem.

The gauge transformations in noncommutative space-time are affected by
the nonlocal product which leads to new interesting properties. In the
*-product formalism the product of two matrix-valued gauge
transfromations is given by the matrix product combined with the
*-product,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

and they act on the fields via

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

From the transformation law one can deduce several restrictions on the
possible choices for the gauge groups and their representations. An
obvious consequence of the *-product is that the NC analogue of @xmath
gauge transformations becomes noncommutative, resembling in this sense
the nonabelian theories in commutative space-time. In [ 75 ] the
noncommutative analogue @xmath gauge field theory was considered and it
was observed that noncommutative QED has the intriguing property that
the electric charge is quantized to the values @xmath and 0. The
restrictions arising from the transformation law ( 4.1 ) were thoroughly
analyzed in [ 76 ] and the results were gathered under a no-go theorem:

1.  A straightforward noncommutative generalization is possible only for
    the unitary group. For example, the *-product of two @xmath matrices
    does not close in general to @xmath .

2.  The only allowed representations are fundamental, antifundamental,
    bifundamental, adjoint, and the trivial representations, i.e. no
    higher rank tensor representations are possible. A field can be
    charged at most under two gauge groups, being in the fundamental
    representation of one group and in the antifundamental
    representation of the other group.

These restrictions, if not circumvented somehow, lead to severe
consequences on model building in noncommutative space-time. For
example, the fractional charges of quarks seem to be inconsistent with
this theorem. Also higher rank representations are required for the
matter content of Grand Unified Theories, but prohibited by the theorem.
Thus a way to circumvent the implications of the theorem seems to be
necessary for noncommutative model building.

Formulation of NC gauge theory in a way that allows the use of ordinary
gauge transformations while still maintaining the noncommutative
products between fields in the Lagrangian can be obtained by defining
twisted gauge symmetries similarly to the twisted space-time
transformations [ 77 , 78 ] . As was argued in [ 56 ] , this approach
seems to be inconsistent with the most strict formulation of the gauge
principle and a more consistent formulation is obtained by
covariantizing the derivatives in the *-product [ 79 ] . However, as in
the case of gravity theory with covariant twist, the gauge-covariant
twist leads to a nonassociative *-product. In the rest of this section
we review two alternative approaches for dealing with the restrictions
of the no-go theorem.

#### 4.1.2 The Seiberg-Witten map

The noncommutative low-energy gauge field theory obtained from string
theory in a background field can be written in terms of a commutative
gauge field theory with a @xmath -dependent action by choosing an
alternative regularization [ 9 ] . The correspondence between these
alternative descriptions is given by the Seiberg-Witten map, which
provides a way to write a noncommutative gauge field theory in terms of
an ordinary gauge field theory with @xmath -dependent action. This idea
was further developed in [ 80 , 81 , 82 ] where it was shown that any
commutative (but possibly nonabelian) gauge algebra can be extended to a
noncommutative version by a generalization of the Seiberg-Witten map.
This way the Seiberg-Witten map provides a way to write a noncommutative
gauge field theory in terms of an ordinary gauge field theory with a
@xmath -dependent action.

To obtain the Seiberg-Witten map between a commutative @xmath gauge
field theory and its noncommutative analogue, consider NC fields @xmath
and @xmath whose gauge transformations are generated by the gauge
parameter @xmath which takes values in the enveloping algebra of @xmath
:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.4)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

The noncommutative fields and gauge parameter are to be written as
functions of the commutative variables,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.5)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.6)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.7)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

which transform as ordinary @xmath fields:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.8)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.9)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Then the unknown expressions @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are determined
by requiring equivalence between the noncommutative and commutative
gauge transformations [ 9 ] ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.10)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.11)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

and can be solved perturbatively. In the lowest order:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.12)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.13)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.14)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Inserting the expansion into the Lagrangian and expanding the *-products
in @xmath , one obtains the noncommutative theory Lagrangian as one with
commutative gauge fields and @xmath -dependent correction terms. The
Seiberg-Witten map provides a way to write noncommutative gauge field
theory in terms of an ordinary gauge field theory and can be used to
build noncommutative models by mapping them to ordinary commutative
gauge field theories with noncommutative correction terms.

#### 4.1.3 Modified gauge transformations

To circumvent the restrictions in noncommutative model building without
resorting to the Seiberg-Witten map which requires one to define the
noncommutative theory in terms of commutative concepts, a modified
version of gauge transformation in NC space-time was introduced in [ 83
] . An important ingredient in this construction is the half-infinite NC
Wilson line operator for the @xmath - gauge group:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.15)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where the integration is along the contour @xmath from @xmath to @xmath
,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the path ordering involves the Moyal *-product between all
functions. Assuming that the gauge transformation goes to unity at
infinity, the transformation law for the half-infinite Wilson line
reads:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now we can define a two-index tensor field by the transformation law:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

This transformation law is closed and thus provides a consistent
definition for a two-index representation of the gauge transformation.
Without the *-products, i.e. in the commutative limit, this
transformation reduces to ordinary commutative transformation of
two-index field. A notable difference to the commutative tensor
representation is that this transformation law does not commute with the
exchange of the tensor indices, @xmath , and thus it does not reduce to
symmetric and antisymmetric representations. A generalization of this
type of gauge transformations to general rank tensors charged under
arbitrary number of gauge groups was given in II .

From the field @xmath and the noncommutative Wilson lines one can
construct a gauge invariant composite field

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

With this gauge invariant object it is easy to construct gauge invariant
Lagrangians. A crucial observation is that @xmath can be obtained from
@xmath by a gauge transformation of the form ( 4.18 ) with @xmath . In
other words @xmath and @xmath lie in the same gauge orbit. Thus it seems
that the gauge invariant Lagrangian that is a function of @xmath and
@xmath can be equally well considered as a function of a single field
@xmath . This would correspond to fixing the gauge @xmath , implying
that any dependence on the Wilson lines can be removed by mere gauge
fixing.

Physical interpretation of the gauge transformations with Wilson lines
inserted still remains somewhat obscure, since all dependence on the
Wilson lines in the action seems to vanish after the gauge fixing.
Especially, it is not clear whether the gauge fixed field can be indeed
treated as a single field without any dependence on the gauge fields.
Reaching a complete understanding of this issue remains an open problem.

Another subtle point is the extra freedom in the construction of the
Lagrangian that was pointed out in II . To construct the kinetic term
e.g. for a scalar field transforming under the rank two tensor
representation of @xmath , one first defines the gauge invariant objects
corresponding to the gauge field and covariant derivatives [ 83 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.20)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.21)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the ordinary NC @xmath gauge field that transforms as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then the kinetic part of the action can be defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

It should be noted that as @xmath is in fact gauge invariant, there is
in principle no reason to introduce gauge fields or covariant
derivatives, as an ordinary derivative would do just as well. However, (
4.23 ) has the property that it reduces to the ordinary gauge invariant
kinetic term of the rank two @xmath field @xmath in the commutative
limit. If the ordinary derivative were chosen, there would be not trace
of the gauge fields in the Lagrangian after the gauge fixing.

### 4.2 Model building

#### 4.2.1 Model building based on the Seiberg-Witten map.

Since the Seiberg-Witten map can be used to define noncommutative
versions of any commutative gauge group, it can be used to construct NC
versions of particle physics models based on any commutative gauge field
theory. The Lagrangian is obtained as an expansion in @xmath with the
zeroth order corresponding to the commutative model and can be used to
calculate NC corrections to physical processes. In [ 84 ] a NC Standard
Model based on the gauge algebra @xmath was constructed. The authors
also argued that the charge quantization problem is avoided by this
construction. In [ 85 ] it was shown that models based on the
Seiberg-Witten map are also anomaly-free.

New features in the model appear when the @xmath -corrections are
considered. For example, parity is broken and vertices with coupling
between the @xmath gauge bosons, @xmath gauge bosons and quarks appear.
Other new effects such as neutral decays of heavy particles such as
@xmath and @xmath quarks may provide experimental signals for NC
space-time. Since the Seiberg-Witten map allows also more general
representations of the gauge algebra than those allowed by the no-go
theorem one can use this method to construct GUT models. In [ 86 ] a NC
GUT based on the gauge group @xmath was constructed.

Supersymmetric extension of the model has not been considered due to the
difficulties in reconciling supersymmetry with the Seiberg-Witten map.
Alternative mappings from the NC SYM are obtained depending on whether
one works in the superfield or component field formalism. The
Seiberg-Witten map for superfields suffers from nonlocal terms, while
the ordinary Seiberg-Witten map for component fields realizes
supersymmetry in the commutative side in a nonlinear form. These issues
have been recently reviewed and clarified in [ 87 ] .

#### 4.2.2 NC SM based on the no-go theorem

If the noncommutative theory is taken to be fundamental, the gauge
theory should be built and analyzed in terms of noncommutative concepts.
The expansion of the action in the Seiberg-Witten map approach may also
lose important nonlocal effects arising from the noncommutativity that
can be seen only if the complete *-products are present. To retain these
effects it is desirable to work in the level of the noncommutative fieds
without expanding the *-products.

In [ 88 ] a noncommutative version of the Standard Model of particle
physics was constructed without resorting to the Seiberg-Witten map.
Even though the field content can be constructed based on @xmath and in
accordance of the no-go theorem, a novel feature is needed to eliminate
extra degrees of freedom of the gauge fields and to obtain fractional
charges for the quarks. In this mechanism also the modified gauge
transformations come into play and at least a small sector in the model
has to circumvent the no-go theorem.

The starting point is the minimal noncommutative extension of the
Standard Model’s @xmath , i.e. @xmath . The gauge group of the NC theory
has two extra degrees of freedom compared to the commutative
counterpart, corresponding to the trace parts of @xmath and @xmath .
These extra degrees of freedom do not decouple properly at low energies
and have to be suppressed somehow in order for the model to be in
agreement with observations. In order to suppress the contribution of
these extra degrees of freedom to low energy physics, a mechanism
similar to the Higgs mechanism of electro-weak symmetry breaking can be
applied. This consists of introducing extra scalar fields that couple
only to the tr-U(1) parts of the @xmath gauge groups and provide masses
to the corresponding gauge fields through their nonzero vacuum
expectation values. This mechanism provides also a way to overcome
another obstacle posed by the no-go theorem, namely charge quantization.
After the symmetry reduction the correct charge and field content is
obtained. Thus the charge quantization problem turns out to be a virtue:
it explains why the charges of quarks are quantized to fractional values
of the electric charge. This can be also considered as an advantage over
the model based on the Seiberg-Witten map.

For the symmetry reduction mechanism, a new field, the so-called Higgsac
field, has to be introduced. In [ 88 ] the Higgsac field was defined as
a scalar field that transforms only under the NC @xmath part @xmath .
The NC @xmath is defined as @xmath NC @xmath , where NC @xmath is the
part of @xmath whose trace goes to zero at the limit of vanishing @xmath
(details of the relevant definitions can be found in [ 88 ] ).

The symmetry reduction in the NC Standard Model takes place in two
stages. First, a Higgsac field @xmath is used to reduce the @xmath part
of the gauge group, resulting in a mass term for a combination of the
trace parts of the gauge bosons. A massless trace component also remains
and is successively mixed with the trace part of the @xmath gauge boson
via coupling to another Higgsac field, @xmath . When @xmath obtains a
nonzero VEV, only one massless @xmath gauge field remains. With high
enough values for the Higgsac VEVs, the massive tr- @xmath fields can be
decoupled from low-energy physics.

It was shown in [ 89 ] that the Higgsac mechanism as described in [ 88 ]
leads to violation of unitarity in scattering processes. As it was
noticed in [ 90 ] and further elaborated in I and II , this is due to
the ill definition of the original Higgsac mechanism. The way that the
@xmath symmetry is defined and spontaneously broken does not respect the
original noncommutative gauge symmetry of the theory and thus it is not
spontaneous symmetry breaking. A refined version of the Higgsac
mechanism was developed in [ 90 ] and I , II . The refined construction
resorts in the modified gauge transformations with NC Wilson lines.

Let us describe the refined Higgsac mechanism in more detail. Take for
example the @xmath gauge symmetry and consider a scalar field defined
by:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is just the rank n-tensor field @xmath in the gauge @xmath and
contracted with the antisymmtric tensor @xmath . The composite field is
gauge invariant and can be expanded as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the first term is the original Higgsac field

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

that transforms only under the tr- @xmath part of the gauge group and
has charge @xmath . A potential providing a nonzero VEV for the
composite field @xmath , will thus break the tr-U(1) symmetry and
provides a mass term for the corresponding gauge field. Since the
Lagrangian is invariant under the original @xmath symmetry, unitarity
should be preserved when the gauge invariant completion in ( 4.25 ) is
taken into account.

In [ 90 ] also another problem with the NC Standard Model was addressed.
With the matter content of the original model the triangle anomalies do
not cancel. To remove this problem, two new leptonic @xmath doublets
were introduced to cancel the anomalies. For these fields one can write
Yukawa couplings to the Higgsac field that provides them masses.

The model described in this section leads to several novel features.
Part of them arise from the *-products and vanish in the commutative
limit @xmath but due to the group theoretical structure of the model
there are also features that are not sensitive to the commutative limit.
This is to be contrasted with the model based on the Seiberg-Witten map
where all new effects are proportional to the noncommutativity
parameter. For example, the two new massive gauge bosons provide NC
corrections to the @xmath -parameter that do not depend on @xmath .
Comparing these contributions with the usual commutative loop
corrections one obtains a lower bound on the masses of the new gauge
bosons

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

A notable effect related to @xmath itself is the dipole moment
proportional to @xmath that arises for all particles. Experimental
bounds on the neutrino dipole moment translate into bound on the scale
of noncommutativity. A crude estimation gives

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

when compared with astrophysical experiments [ 88 ] . This is of the
same order as the bounds arising from Lamb shift and bounds on Lorentz
violation [ 33 , 34 ] .

It should be noted that some subtle points in this construction still
remain. First thing is to note that the matter fields were originally
constructed by exploiting the restrictions of the no-go theorem.
However, with the Higgsac-construction described above, the modified
gauge transformations are needed in the model anyway and the no-go
theorem has to be circumvented. Thus, in principle, there is no need to
stick with the ordinary gauge transformations for the matter sector
either. Another unclear issue is the treatment of the modified gauge
transformations themselves and especially the observation discussed in
II : it seems as if the composite Higgsac field can be considered as
@xmath with a specific gauge fixing. Thus, without expanding the Wilson
lines it seems that the scalar field does not couple to the gauge fields
at all and thus the symmetry reduction is in fact just an artifact of
the expansion. Thus the issue of the symmetry reduction should be
considered as an unsolved problem of the model.

Another candidate for a noncommutative Standard Model was constructed in
paper [ 91 ] . The model is based on the larger gauge group @xmath .
Without the supersymmetric enhancement discussed in paper I , the @xmath
gauge field of the model described above can not be treated as a photon
due to disastrous quantum corrections. The idea behind the larger gauge
group is to construct the @xmath gauge field from a traceless
combination of @xmath generators and to make the tr- @xmath parts
decouple at low energies. It was argued in [ 91 ] that this decoupling
is actually produced by the UV/IR-mixing which causes a logarithmic
decreasing of the tr-U(1) coupling at low energies. However, the
logarithmic running of the couplings is too slow to provide a solution
to the problem [ 38 ] .

#### 4.2.3 Nc Mssm

The @xmath -model described in previous subsection can be generalized to
include supersymmetry. While supersymmetrization is interesting for the
same reasons as in the commutative case, it turns out that supersymmetry
also improves some problems arising from noncommutativity at the quantum
level. Especially, quantum corrections to the polarization tensor of the
@xmath gauge boson include harmful effects such as vacuum birefringence
and tachyonic instability [ 16 , 27 , 92 , 38 ] . With the help of
supersymmetry these problems can be alleviated.

The generalization of the superfield formalism to the noncommutative
setting was given in [ 93 ] . The noncommutative superspace is
constructed by extending the noncommutative algebra of the bosonic
coordinates to include the anticommuting fermionic superspace
coordinates:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (4.29)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have used the roman indices to denote the space-time
directions. Here we assume that the commutators of the fermionic
coordinates are not deformed and thus there is no
non-anticommmutativity. Then the superfields are defined just as in the
commutative case and the algebra ( 4.29 ) can be realized by imposing
the Moyal *-product,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

The generalization of supersymmetric gauge theories to the
noncommutative setting goes through as in the non-supersymmetric case
and the restrictions of the no-go theorem apply. Construction of the
noncommutative superpotential for MSSM leads to two possible choices
that give the commutative MSSM matter content with some additional
fields included. One of the choices include two leptonic doublets for
each family to cancel chiral anomalies, while the other includes four
such doublets. In Table 4.1 the matter content for the minimal model
with two leptonic doublets @xmath and @xmath is given, and the
corresponding superpotential is

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The model has @xmath symmetry which has to be reduced. The symmetry
reduction mechanism with Higgsac fields has to be generalized to the
sypersymmetric setting and to this aim one has to first introduce
supersymmetric noncommutative Wilson lines. The supersymmetric
generalization of the Higgsac mechanism turns out to be rather
straightforward and without going to the details, which can be found in
paper I , the @xmath -parity conserving superpotential reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.32)
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (4.33)
     @xmath      (4.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the index @xmath denotes groups the Higgsac superfields are
associated with, @xmath .

As in the NC SM, here also the model possesses new features compared to
ordinary MSSM, that are not related to the scale of noncommutativity.
Instead of two Higgs doublets, four had to be introduced to build the
superpotential. In this model the new down-type Higgs bosons @xmath and
@xmath must obtain vacuum expectation values in order to give masses to
the down-type quarks, while @xmath and @xmath , corresponding to the
usual Higgs bosons appearing in the commutative MSSM, provide masses to
the up-type quarks and leptons. The new Higgs fields can provide
indirect observable signals of noncommutativity.

An important feature of supersymmetry is that the dangerous quantum
corrections to the polarization tensor of the tr-U(1) field cancel. Thus
the infrared singularity, tachyonic mass and vacuum birefringence
problem are removed. However, SUSY has to be broken at the energy scales
of the Standard Model, and contributions to these problems potentially
arise from the scales with broken SUSY. In paper I the quantum
corrections to the polarization tensor of the tr- @xmath gauge boson in
the presence of soft SUSY breaking terms were analyzed. When the bosonic
and fermionic degrees of freedom match, the infrared singularity is
cancelled and thus soft SUSY breaking does not affect this cancellation
[ 16 ] . Other effects remain, but a qualitative analysis leads to the
result that even with very conservative bounds on the scale of
noncommutativity and the scale of supersymmetry breaking, the vacuum
birefringence effect can be highly suppressed.

The dispersion relation for the polarization that receives the new
effect can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.36)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Here @xmath is the scale of noncommutativity, @xmath is the scale where
SUSY breaking occurs and @xmath describes the difference between bosonic
and fermionic masses

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

The strongest bound on @xmath come from cosmological observations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

For example, choosing @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath GeV leads to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is well beneath the experimental bounds. Thus we conclude that the
existence of supersymmetry at high energies can suppress significantly
the Lorentz violating effects that seem to ruin the nonsupersymmetric
theory. The behavior of the @xmath running coupling constant is still
altered by UV/IR mixing and a more thorough analyzis of this behaviour
is needed in order to derive phenomenological implications. It should be
also noted that this analysis does not remove the possibility of a
tachyonic photon. Finally, we note that the subtleties with the symmetry
reduction mechanism described in the end of the previous sections remain
also in the supersymmetric version.

Further extension of this model can be considered. The general
representations made possible by the modified gauge transformations
allow for construction of noncommutative Grand Unified Theories. A NC
GUT based on the @xmath was briefly analyzed in [ 83 ] .

## Chapter 5 Conclusions

The necessity of modification of the description of space-time as a
manifold at very short distances calls for candidates for a theory of
quantum space-time. The idea of noncommutativity as a way to describe
properties of the quantized space-time stems from the principles of
quantum mechanics and gravity theory applied on physics at very short
distances [ 8 ] . Further support to this idea comes from open string
theory in the presence of a background field [ 9 ] . While the complete
theory of physics at short distances is presumably more complicated,
quantum field theory in noncommutative space-time may capture some
essential features of the quantum space-time and provide insight into
quantum gravity.

The papers included in this thesis encompass various aspects of quantum
field theory and gauge symmetries in noncommutative space-time,
enlightening also some of the fundamental problems that still need
solving. One of the most important issues is the symmetry of quantum
space-time. The canonical approach, with Heisenberg-like commutation
relations for the coordinates with a constant parameter of
noncommutativity seem to break Lorentz invariance of the theory. Then
the Poincaré symmetry is preserved only in a twisted form [ 56 ] .
Lorentz symmetry has become such a fundamental property in modern
particle physics theories, that giving it up seems awkward and thus
attempts towards a formulation that preserves the Lorentz symmetry have
been considered in the literature [ 57 ] . To preserve Lorentz
invariance, it seems necessary to allow states with noncommuting space
and time. On the other hand, time-space noncommutativity is known to
lead to difficulties in quantum field theory, as causality and unitarity
is lost. Thus the Lorentz-invariant NC QFT also suffers from these
problems III .

Another important flaw in the formulation of quantum space-time in terms
of the canonical commutator relation is that the commutator induces
infinite nonlocality. Infinite nonlocality causes effects in field
theory that are difficult to reconcile with observed physics. The
causality condition is modified to allow infinite propagation speed in
at least one diretion. Also quantum corrections in field theory suffer
from a mixing between ultraviolet and infrared degrees of freedom that
make renormalization difficult. First attempt towards a formulation with
restricted nonlocality can be found in [ 23 ] .

Despite the fact that some fundamental issues in NC theories are still
to be solved, it is important to make contact with physics at accessible
energies. If Lorentz invariance is indeed broken in noncommutative
space-time, then it has important phenomenological consequences, which
may provide a way to detect noncommutativity. Of utmost importance to
model building is also to find the proper NC generalization of gauge
symmetries. A straightforward generalization of the gauge
transformations to include the *-products causes several restrictions on
model building. These restrictions can be advantageous, providing an
explanation for the charge quantization, but they also pose significant
problems for the NC Standard Model [ 88 ] and NC MSSM I . In order to
obtain the @xmath gauge symmetries of the Standard Model at low
energies, it seems that at least part of the restrictions have to be
circumvented. One solution is to insert appropriate Wilson lines into
the gauge transformations as proposed in [ 83 ] and II . This approach
allows one to circumvent some of the restrictions posed on the
representations of noncommutative gauge groups. Another popular approach
to NC model building is to use the Seiberg-Witten map to define the NC
gauge theory in terms of a commutative one.

The study of noncommutative field theories provides fresh insight to
physics at the fundamental level where the usual concept of particles as
fields in a continuous space-time can not be maintained. While some
naive expectations have proven false, noncommutativity has certainly
brought new exciting features to the study of quantum field theories. We
have found that fundamental properties of ordinary quantum field
theories, such as Lorentz symmetry and causality, need revision in
noncommutative space-time. Finding a firm understanding of such issues
will be important when paving the way towards a complete theory of
quantum space-time.
