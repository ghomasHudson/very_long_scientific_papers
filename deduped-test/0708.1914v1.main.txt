###### List of Figures

-    1.1 A Penrose diagram of a typical collapse spacetime. Shown is our
    numerical null grid which extends to future null infinity @xmath .
    The grid consists of the null slices @xmath and ingoing radial null
    geodesics @xmath . Evolution slows down in the vicinity of the
    future event horizon @xmath . We also indicate lines (a) @xmath ,
    (b) @xmath and (c) @xmath , where @xmath is the final black hole
    mass.
-    2.1 Bondi coordinates @xmath . @xmath is the proper time at the
    center of spherical symmetry, @xmath is an areal radial coordinate.
    A regular center is assumed at @xmath .
-    2.2 This figure shows how the @xmath null slices approach an
    apparent horizon in the late part of a near-critical time evolution.
    Observe how the first slices shown are still close to a flat space
    null-cone, whereas the last slices extend almost in a vertical
    direction, i.e. @xmath .
-    2.3 This figure shows the same situation as depicted in 2.2 , but
    for a near-critical compactified run. The initial slice is by
    definition a straight line. All slices extend to @xmath at @xmath .
    Late slices exhibit the formation of an apparent horizon close to
    the origin.
-    3.1 The computational molecule for the NSWE scheme is made up by
    two @xmath hypersurfaces and two ingoing @xmath null geodesics.
-    4.1 This figure shows the focussing of ingoing null-geodesics by
    gravity in the late stages of a slightly supercritical evolution.
    The discretely self-similar dynamics causes the density of the
    geodesics to increase in a periodic manner.
-    4.2 The convergence of the error diagnostic @xmath with increasing
    grid resolution for two near-critical evolutions. Evolution (1) uses
    5000 gridpoints and @xmath and evolution (2) uses 10000 gridpoints
    and @xmath . The data displayed as dots and circles have been
    sampled.
-    4.3 A 3-level convergence test for @xmath
-    4.4 A 3-level convergence test for @xmath .
-    4.5 A 2-level convergence test for @xmath .
-    4.6 This figure shows the double-null grid around the origin. We
    have indicated the new slice being computed by @xmath (with time
    index @xmath ) and the v-index that hits the origin on that slice,
    by @xmath . Four gridpoints which lie at constant @xmath (flat space
    time coordinate) are indicated by filled circles. Using these
    gridpoints, one can approximate derivatives of type @xmath .
-    4.7 This figure shows @xmath for a series of @xmath null-slices.
    The first three slices are untrapped, while the last three contain
    an apparent horizon, the radius of which decreases with increasing
    retarded time @xmath .
-    4.8 Instead of showing the null expansions @xmath which diverge at
    the origin due to their @xmath dependence, we depict @xmath and
    @xmath which decide the sign of the expansions as functions of
    @xmath . We show one slice shortly before apparent horizon formation
    (red and blue curves) and a second slice containing a marginally
    trapped surface (green, violet). Note that the function @xmath
    barely changes between the two slices, while @xmath abruptly bends
    down into negative values. In contrast to figure 4.7 , where we
    plotted @xmath as a function of advanced time @xmath , @xmath first
    grows with @xmath , and after reaching the horizon radius, it
    decreases again; the null slice “bends” back towards the curvature
    singularity in the black hole. The condition for an apparent
    horizon, @xmath while @xmath is fulfilled.
-    4.9 This diagram shows the location of the trapping horizon in a
    numerically generated spacetime by the double-null code. The
    coordinates are linear combinations of the null coordinates @xmath .
    This choice allows us to map null slices into diagonal lines. The
    trappped and untrapped regions have been shaded light and dark blue.
    The trapped region is bounded by the trapping horizon and the outer
    grid boundary. In addition, we indicate an approximation of the
    event horizon.
-    4.10 This figure shows how to adjust the outer grid boundary @xmath
    (or equivalently @xmath ) in order to accurately resolve the
    self-similar features of critical collapse close to the origin.
-    4.11 Here we show the spatial variation of the absolute value of
    the constraint C1 for some slices of a subcritical evolution. The
    maximum of @xmath over the course of the evolution is below @xmath .
    Figure 4.12 shows the constraint for the supercritical case.
-    4.12 This figure shows the absolute value of the constraint C1 for
    a few slices of a supercritical evolution. On the null slice # 2175,
    an apparent horizon has formed at @xmath which causes the constraint
    to grow about three orders of magnitude.
-    4.13 This figure shows the mass-function @xmath for two successive
    null slices in the lowest resolution (1001 gridpoints) run of the
    convergence test. An apparent horizon is detected on slice # 544 at
    @xmath . The detail shows that the AH is well resolved.
-    4.14 This figure shows the convergence of the @xmath -norm of the
    constraint C1 . Initially, the convergence is fourth order, but note
    that the finite difference error for the lowest resolution run is
    about @xmath . For @xmath convergence is roughly second order. An
    apparent horizon formes at @xmath with a mass of @xmath . The
    constraint violations reach 0.1 at the formation of the apparent
    horizon, but otherwise are fine.
-    4.15 This figure shows a 3-level convergence test for the scalar
    field @xmath . The field is clearly second order convergent.
-    4.16 Calculation of @xmath
-    5.1 This diagram shows a prototypical self-similar spacetime. The
    adapted coordinates @xmath defined in equations ( 5.1.7 ) and (
    5.1.8 ) cover only the region @xmath . The metric functions @xmath ,
    @xmath and @xmath are constant along lines of constant @xmath .
    Thus, their features shrink to zero as one approaches the
    accumulation point at @xmath . Self-similarity is confined to the
    backwards lightcone of the accumulation point, which extends from
    the origin to the past self similarity horizon at @xmath .
-    5.2 A qualitative picture of the phase-space of near critical
    evolutions. Every point corresponds to one configuration @xmath .
    The stable manifold contains a codimension one discretely
    self-similar solution, depicted as a limit cycle, as it is periodic
    in @xmath . We have indicated a one-parameter family of initial data
    by a line that intersects the critical surface on the left. At the
    “critical” parameter value @xmath , the trajectory is attracted by
    the stable modes of the critical solution and never leaves the
    stable manifold, ultimately arriving at the DSS solution in the
    limit @xmath . Trajectories with @xmath may approach the critical
    solution for some time, as long as the admixture of the unstable
    mode is small, but ultimately leave the vicinity of the critical
    solution and move on to form a black hole. In contrast,
    configurations with @xmath eventually disperse and reach flat space.
-    6.1 This figure shows the scalar field monopole moment @xmath for a
    near-critical (but barely supercritical) evolution. The half-periods
    measured from one extremum to the next roughly agree with the
    prediction of perturbation theory shown in figure 6.2 .
-    6.2 The exponential decay of the QNM half-periods predicted by
    perturbation theory is shown with annotated values at the midpoints
    between the points of inflection for the same near–critical
    evolution as in figure 6.1 .
-    6.3 This figure shows a Penrose diagram of null dust collapse. For
    @xmath the spacetime is flat. In the interval @xmath the ingoing
    massless radiation described by the Vaidya metric forms a black
    hole. For @xmath the inflow of matter has stopped and this part of
    spacetime is isometric to the exterior region of Schwarzschild.
-    6.4 The monopole moment of the scalar field decays in accordance
    with self-similar scaling. We have corrected a small offset in
    @xmath and plot @xmath .
-    6.5 This figure checks that the non-stationarity criterion for QNM
    for critical collapse simulated by the DICE code. The connected
    filled circles represent @xmath at the extrema of @xmath , while the
    lower curve shows @xmath . With the exception of the very late
    stages of collapse we are in the stationary regime. Figure 6.6 shows
    a detail of this plot.
-    6.6 This figure shows a detail of 6.5
-    6.7 This figure shows power-law exponents for a subcritical
    evolution and illustrates the domains of validity of the predictions
    of perturbation theory for the two zones: @xmath near @xmath and
    @xmath near @xmath .
-    6.8 We compare the decay of the Bondi mass in supercritical,
    near–critical and subcritical evolutions. In the subcritical case,
    the Bondi mass is found to decay for late times with a power-law
    exponent of approximately @xmath .
-    7.1 We show the news function @xmath , first as a function of the
    natural time coordinate @xmath of an asymptotic observer and also as
    a function of a suitably adapted time @xmath where @xmath is
    periodic with period @xmath after the spacetime has come close to
    the critical solution. Even if the constant @xmath is not known, it
    can be determined by a fit to periodicity in @xmath . Thus, it is
    possible to observe DSS at @xmath and to extract the critical
    exponent @xmath .
-    7.2 This figure superimposes the left and right hand sides (empty
    and filled circles, respectively) of equation ( 3.7.12 ), the Bondi
    mass-loss equation, and plots them against adapted time @xmath for a
    very near critical evolution. The data have been sampled in order
    that individual data points are visible. Until @xmath the empty and
    filled circles are indistinguishable in the plot, i.e. the mass-loss
    equation holds with a high degree of accuracy. Around @xmath a small
    black hole is starting to form, the resolution has been exhausted
    and numerical results are unreliable. It is apparent that the bursts
    of scalar field radiation which escape to @xmath are periodic in
    @xmath with the same period @xmath which is found in the DSS
    behavior of fields near the origin.
-    7.3 This figure shows the redshift factor @xmath for the
    compactified evolution depicted in figure 7.2 . Variations in the
    density ( @xmath ) of the discretely self-similar scalar field
    subject the outgoing light rays to a varying amount of focussing.
    When a black hole starts to form around @xmath , the redshift factor
    diverges exponentially.
-    7.4 The fine-structure in @xmath after subtracting a linear fit.
    The measured period @xmath is close to the value predicted by
    perturbation theory @xmath .
-    7.5 This figure shows the mass-scaling law for a series of
    uncompactified evolutions at 5000 gridpoints radial resolution.
    @xmath is well fit by a straight line with slope @xmath . For @xmath
    which corresponds to @xmath our code reaches the precision limit for
    double precision floating point numbers. On the other hand, for
    @xmath we are leaving the range of validity of linear perturbation
    theory which predicts the simple power-law behavior of the mass.
-    7.6 This figure shows the mass-scaling law for a series of 200
    compactified evolutions using 8000 gridpoints (depicted as a
    continuous line) and 20 evolutions using 16000 gridpoints (depicted
    as black dots). Note that as @xmath depends on the gridresolution
    @xmath , one has to use @xmath and @xmath , respectively for the two
    datasets. For @xmath the black hole masses asymptote to a different
    constant value for each resolution. For @xmath we are leaving the
    range of validity of linear perturbation theory which predicts the
    simple power-law behavior of the mass. In the intermediate range
    @xmath , @xmath is well fit by a straight line with slope @xmath .
-    7.7 A conformal diagram of a critical collapse spacetime. In the
    backwards light cone of the accumulation point the dynamics are
    close to the DSS critical solution. The lightlike boundary is also
    called the past self-similarity horizon (SSH). Depending on whether
    the initial data are sub- or supercritical, the spacetime will for
    late times be Minkowski or Schwarzschild.
-    7.8 This figure plots the Bondi mass @xmath against both @xmath and
    the adapted time @xmath for a barely supercritical evolution with
    final black hole mass @xmath . The Bondi mass @xmath and the mass at
    the past SSH, @xmath , are found to decrease exponentially in @xmath
    (with an overlayed @xmath -periodic oscillation with period @xmath
    ), once the evolution has sufficiently approached the critical
    solution near the center of spherical symmetry. We also show @xmath
    , the energy present outside of the SSH.
-    7.9 Shown is the mass-function on two null-slices very late in the
    nearcritical evolution depicted in fig. 7.8 . Excluding the
    gridpoint at @xmath , the compactified grid extends to large values
    of the areal radial coordinate @xmath . For last slice shown, the
    location of the past SSH is approximately at @xmath . The matter
    exterior to the SSH, @xmath is mostly concentrated in the radial
    region @xmath .
-    7.10 This figure shows a surface plot of @xmath for the same
    nearcritical evolution as in figures 7.8 , 6.1 and 6.2 . When the
    initial Gaussian reaches the origin, it is “instantly” (in retarded
    time @xmath ) radiated to future null infinity @xmath (located at
    @xmath ) by interfering nonlinearly with the field that has not yet
    reached the origin. Once the evolution has come close to the
    critical solution, the matter field @xmath decays exponentially;
    further self-similar features are thus not visible in this plot.
-    7.11 This is a typical plot of the black hole diagnostic @xmath vs.
    @xmath computed using the compactified DICE code with 8000
    gridpoints. The parameter @xmath can be readily extracted from the
    picture. The accumulation time @xmath was determined as the time of
    the formation of the very small black hole with mass @xmath . For
    @xmath , @xmath rapidly approaches unity, which heralds the
    formation of an apparent horizon.
-    7.12 This figure displays snapshots of a near-critical
    uncompactified evolution with @xmath gridpoints of the massless
    scalar field @xmath as a function of @xmath . The frames are evenly
    spaced in the adapted time coordinate @xmath . Observe that the
    shape of @xmath is identical in every 8th frame; thus, @xmath is
    periodic with period @xmath . Moreover, @xmath is antisymmetric with
    respect to every 4th frame, i.e. it satisfies the half-period
    self-similarity condition ( 5.1.23 ). Figures 7.13 and 7.14 show
    other discretely self-similar quantities from the same numerical
    evolution.
-    7.13 Snapshots of the dimensionless black hole formation diagnostic
    @xmath for the same near-critical evolution as shown in figure 7.12
    .
-    7.14 This figure shows @xmath (depicted by a few sampled dots) at a
    time @xmath , when the evolution was in the echoing region overlaid
    with its image under the DSS diffeomorphism @xmath , @xmath
    (represented by the continuous line). Since @xmath is not
    dimensionless, its amplitude had to be rescaled by @xmath .
-    7.15 This figure shows @xmath for a near- critical compactified
    evolution. In the direction of increasing @xmath the features of the
    scalar field repeat themselves with a period @xmath since @xmath
    fulfills the half-period self-similarity condition ( 5.1.23 ).
    Concurrently, these features are shifted towards the origin by
    @xmath in @xmath ( @xmath near the origin). Figure 7.16 shows a
    planar view of the same surface.
-    7.16 This figure shows a planar view of @xmath for the same
    evolution depicted in figure 7.15 . The ingoing wave packet is
    clearly visible on the initial slice ( @xmath ) of the evolution.
    The the tail ends of the bumps are enveloped by the null geodesic
    that barely hits the accumulation point which is shown separately in
    figure 7.17 .
-    7.17 This figure shows the null geodesic which almost hits the
    accumulation point in the evolution shown in figures 7.16 and 7.15
-    7.18 This figure shows mass scaling for a family of evolutions
    using 8000 gridpoints. The critical exponent is given by the slope
    of the fitted line, which yields @xmath . Note that this scaling is
    perfectly consistent with the analytical scaling law and does not
    suffer from the leveling-off artifact present in mass scaling laws
    generated from the compactified DICE code.
-    7.19 Here we show curvature scaling for a series of subcritical
    evolutions using 8000 gridpoints. The maximum of the Ricci scalar at
    the axis, plotted as @xmath , behaves as in equation ( 5.3.12 ). The
    scaling exponent extracted from the fit is @xmath .
-    7.20 Shown is the mass-function of a series of null slices of a
    supercritical evolution close to criticality. The formation of an
    apparent horizon manifests itself in the bending over of the curves
    in the @xmath -coordinate. After having reached its maximum @xmath
    -value the slice bends back towards @xmath and reaches the curvature
    singularity. This necessitates the excision of gridpoints coming too
    close to @xmath .
-    7.21 Shown is the mass-function of a series of slices of a
    subcritical evolution close to criticality. The initial data are
    very close to those in figure 7.20 , which ultimately forms an
    apparent horizon. In this evolution, the scalar field disperses,
    ultimately, reaching Minkowski space
-    7.22 This figure shows figures 7.20 and 7.21 superimposed. The two
    evolutions almost coincide in the first few slices shown, when the
    apparent horizon has not yet formed. Gradually, the agreement gets
    worse for @xmath , while it is still close for larger @xmath . Then,
    an apparent horizon forms in the supercritical evolution, while the
    subcritical evolution continues to radiate scalar field that has
    reached the origin and ultimately disperses.
-    7.23 This figure shows the mass-function before and after the
    formation of an apparent horizon for a brute force evolution at
    100000 gridpoints. The reduction of @xmath was still not able to
    resolve the bending over of the slices fast enough to have the
    trapped slice extend up to the exterior matter.
-    7.24 Similar to figure 4.9 , this spacetime diagram shows the
    formation of an apparent horizon and the region of spacetime that
    has been evolved. This time, we are dealing with an evolution using
    double Gaussian initial data, chosen such that the outer pulse forms
    the apparent horizon (first in @xmath ) while the inner one reaches
    @xmath later in retarded time @xmath . Then, excision kicks in and
    we are left with a very small grid.
-    7.25 Collapse of double Gaussian initial data. Density plot of
    @xmath shows the ingoing pulses, contraction of matter and ultimate
    apparent horizon formation. (exterior pulse first in @xmath )
-    7.26 Shown is a detail of figure 7.25
-    7.27 This figure shows a perspective view of the spacetime depicted
    in figure 7.25 .
-    7.28 This figure shows a density plot of the diagnostic @xmath on a
    @xmath grid for a supercritical evolution using double Gaussian
    initial data.
-    7.29 This figure shows spacetime diagrams for @xmath observers. In
    the left evolution, the scalar field configuration formed an
    apparent horizon as is evident from the @xmath curves approaching
    the null surface @xmath of the event horizon. In contrast, the
    evolution shown in the right frame turned out to be subcritical.

-    C.5 This figure shows the directions of error accumulation present
    in the NSWE-scheme and a prototypical Cauchy finite differencing
    scheme. In the Cauchy scheme, we loose only one order of accuracy
    from the accumulation in the time direction. In the NSWE scheme,
    however, there is coupling in the radial direction, as we see from
    its computational molecule (figure C.3 ). Combined with the ingoing
    null direction we therefore loose two orders of accuracy, in total.

## Chapter 1 Introduction

In the context of general relativity, consider the collapse of a
spherical shell of matter under its own weight. The dynamics of this
process, as modelled by the coupled Einstein and matter field equations,
can be understood intuitively in terms of the competition between
gravitational attraction and repulsive internal forces (due, for
instance, to kinetic energy or pressure). Typically, such an isolated
system ends up in one of three distinct states. If the initial
configuration is dilute, then the repulsive forces will dominate and the
collapsing matter will implode through the center and disperse, leaving
flat space behind. If, on the other hand, the density of the initial
configuration is sufficiently large, some fraction of the initial mass
will form a black hole. In some matter models it is also possible to
form stable stars, but, for the sake of simplicity, we will disregard
this possibility in the following. Critical gravitational collapse
occurs when the attracting and repulsive forces governing the dynamics
of the collapse process are almost in balance, or, in other words, the
initial configuration is near the threshold of black hole formation.

Critical phenomena in gravitational collapse have been originally
discovered in the seminal numerical investigations of scalar field
collapse by Choptuik [ d’I92a , Cho93 ] . Using sophisticated numerical
techniques, Choptuik investigated the threshold of black hole formation
for the self-gravitating massless scalar field in spherical symmetry. He
evolved one-parameter families of initial data that interpolate between
black hole formation and dispersion and fine-tuned the initial data
parameter, @xmath , through a bisection search to its critical value,
@xmath , where a black hole is just formed. Choptuik was able to give
convincing evidence that black holes of arbitrarily small mass can be
created. Moreover, he discovered the following surprising phenomena: The
black hole mass depends on the initial data parameter via a simple power
law

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.0.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for @xmath . All near-critical solutions approach a discretely
self-similar solution at intermediate times. This so-called “critical
solution” or “Choptuon” is characterized by a constant @xmath . These
phenomena and the “critical exponents” @xmath and @xmath are independent
of the family of initial data. Therefore, critical phenomena are
universal within a given model. In the dynamical systems picture, the
phase space (or space of initial data) of this system is divided into
basins of attraction, with black holes and Minkowski space as
attractors.

Hamadé and Stewart [ HS96 ] have found numerical evidence, that the
critical solution contains a naked singularity which can be seen at
future null infinity. The problem has also been studied extensively from
an analytic point of view by Christodoulou [ Chr86 , Chr87 , Chr91 ,
Chr94 ] . In particular, he was able to prove that the space of regular
initial data that lead to naked singularities has measure zero [ Chr99 ]
, so that the appearance of the naked singularity is non-generic.
Similar critical solutions – exhibiting (continuous or discrete)
self-similarity – have also been found for several other types of matter
fields, and have been constructed directly in several cases [ Gun95 ,
Gun97b , Gun97a , LTHA02 , Lec01 ] .

In this thesis we present further numerical studies of spherically
symmetric scalar field critical collapse. We extend previous
investigations by focussing on global aspects of this problem, and, for
the most part, use a compactified evolution scheme which includes null
infinity on our numerical grid. The motivation is twofold: The main goal
of our investigation was to gain an understanding of local versus global
issues in critical collapse. In particular, we try to address questions
like: What is the role of asymptotic flatness for critical collapse
(e.g. the critical solution, the “Choptuon” is self-similar, and thus
not asymptotically flat)? How would hypothetical detectors of radiation
observe the dynamics close to criticality? How can we understand the way
null infinity approximates observers at large distances in this simple
but nontrivial setup? The second motivation is to test numerical
algorithms which are based on compactification methods in a situation
that is very demanding on accuracy. We will argue that at least in the
model considered here, global methods do not cause a significant penalty
in accuracy, but simplify the interpretation of certain results.

In the current work, we refer to critical collapse phenomena as
“critical collapse at the threshold of apparent horizon formation” to
avoid possible misunderstandings, since critical collapse is essentially
a quasilocal phenomenon and the standard definition of black holes is
based on global concepts (see textbooks like e.g. [ Wal84 ] ). Also, the
choice of a local threshold criterion emphasizes the relation of these
phenomena to other areas in nonlinear PDEs, where related phenomena
occur, but the concept of black holes is absent.

Critical behavior of the kind originally found by Choptuik is usually
referred to as type II, because of its formal correspondence with type
II phase transitions of statistical physics. A different type of
critical solutions at the threshold of black hole formation,
corresponding to type I phase transitions, is provided by unstable
static configurations – like those found by Bartnik and McKinnon [ BM88
] .

Linear perturbation calculations of such critical solutions revealed
exactly one unstable mode, which confirmed their interpretation as
intermediate attractors in the language of dynamical systems. Critical
phenomena in general relativity are reviewed in [ Gun98 , Biz96 ] ,
including discussions in terms of phase transitions and renormalization
group techniques familiar from statistical physics.

A massless scalar field in spherical symmetry exhibits type II critical
collapse (there are no regular stationary or time-periodic solutions).
Type II critical solutions have been found to exhibit continuous or
discrete self-similarity in the past lightcone of the singularity. In
our case, the critical solution is known to be discretely self-similar
(DSS), and has been constructed directly as an eigenvalue problem [
Gun95 ] .

A spacetime is said to be DSS [ Gun99 ] if it admits a discrete
diffeomorphism @xmath which leaves the metric invariant up to a constant
scale factor:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.0.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a dimensionless real constant and @xmath .

We choose scalar field critical collapse in spherical symmetry for
several reasons: the model is very well studied and we can compare with
a large amount of previous numerical and analytical results.
Furthermore, the model is also very demanding: The value of the echoing
period in the DSS critical solution is @xmath , which is quite larger
compared to many other models. Note that larger values of @xmath make it
more difficult to resolve a large number of echos.

Our numerical method is based on a characteristic initial value problem,
i.e. we foliate spacetime by null cones. This allows for a very
efficient evolution system and simplifies the study of the causal
structure of the solutions. In spherical symmetry, caustics are
restricted to the center of symmetry, so we do not have to deal with the
dynamical appearance of caustics, which causes potential problems for
characteristic initial value problems in higher dimensions.

The numerical approach used in the compactified code [ PHA05 ] is based
on the “DICE” (Diamond Integral Characteristic Evolution) code, which
has been documented in [ HLP @xmath 00 ] . It mixes techniques from
previous work of Garfinkle [ Gar95 ] and the Pittsburgh group [ GW92b ,
Win05 ] , in particular we follow Garfinkle in moving along ingoing null
geodesics to utilize gravitational focusing for increasing resolution in
the region of large curvature. Furthermore, compactification methods are
well studied and relatively straightforward to implement in
characteristic codes.

An important aspect of our compactified characteristic evolution scheme
is that at late times our null slices asymptotically approach the event
horizon, see Fig. 1.1 . Essentially this is because our coordinates can
not penetrate a dynamical horizon [ AK02 , AK03 , AK04 , Hay94b ] (they
become singular at a marginally trapped surface, e.g. at an apparent
horizon), which is spacelike if any matter or radiation falls through it
and null otherwise [ HE73 , AK04 ] . Note that the dynamical horizon is
contained inside of the event horizon, and the outermost dynamical
horizon approaches (or coincides with) the event horizon at late times,
assuming cosmic censorship holds. This fact makes our approach in some
sense complementary to previous critical collapse studies, which were
not adapted to the asymptotic regime.

To further investigate physical quantities such as the mass function
when a dynamical horizon forms, we employ an uncompactified double-null
code which can penetrate dynamical horizons. This code is based on the
work of Hamadé and Stewart [ HS96 ] and improvements by Harada and Carr
[ Har05 ] . The code has also been developed to analyze collapse
problems in @xmath dimensional gravity.

In this thesis we focus on those aspects of critical collapse which are
associated with global structure, and in particular the phenomenology
seen by asymptotic observers. For the sake of completeness, We will also
discuss other well-studied aspects such as mass scaling or local DSS
behavior in the past self-similarity horizon.

### 1.1 Organization of this Thesis

This thesis is organized as follows: in chapter 2 we discuss
characteristic surfaces of hyperbolic PDE’s, mention different horizon
concepts for black holes, and introduce our geometric setup, which is
based on Bondi-type coordinates and double-null coordinates in spherical
symmetry. In this context we also state gauge and regularity conditions
at the origin.

Chapter 3 we present evolution systems for the Einstein-massless scalar
field problem in both Bondi and double-null coordinates. We discuss a
compactification scheme which introduces the Misner-Sharp mass-function
as an independent evolution variable, which renders our evolution system
regular at null infinity. We also mention physical quantities of
interest, such as the Bondi-mass and Ricci scalar curvature.

Our numerical algorithms are presented in chapter 4 . In addition to the
numerical schemes for the Bondi and double-null codes, we discuss issues
of mesh-refinement, accuracy, convergence and the satisfaction of
constraint equations in numerical evolutions.

Chapter 5 deals with critical phenomena in gravitational collapse. We
introduce the concept of continuous and discrete self-similarity, the
dynamical systems picture and present a standard derivation of the
mass-scaling law.

In chapter 6 , we introduce quasinormal modes and tails and present
heuristic results for the presence of the least scalar damped QNM of a
Schwarzschild black hole in critical collapse evolutions. We also study
power-law tail exponents in different regions of numerical spacetime.

In chapter 7 we give a detailed discussion of our numerical results
pertaining to critical behavior, which include a comparison of the
radiation signal at future null infinity with a heuristic estimate based
on self-similar scaling and the accumulation of matter exterior to the
past self-similarity horizon via backscattering.

Our results and conclusions are summarized in chapter 8 .

In Appendix A and B we list tensor components in Bondi and double-null
coordinates. Appendix C discusses numerical methods, starting from
discretizations of ordinary differential equations and presenting a
heuristic error analysis for the NSWE-algorithm. Finally, appendix D
mentions the basic methodology which underlies convergence tests.

### 1.2 Conventions

We use the metric signature @xmath and work in “geometrized units”
@xmath . Spacetime indices are Latin. Space indices are denoted by Greek
letters. Angular indices or indices of two-dimensional tensors are
denoted by capital Latin letters.

## Chapter 2 Geometric Setup

### 2.1 Some Notes on Hyperbolic PDEs

In this thesis we will essentially be dealing with the numerical
solution of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) on
characteristic manifolds. Since this characteristic approach is entirely
different from and not as common as the standard spacelike Cauchy
problem, it is well worth the effort to investigate how characteristics
and associated concepts feature in the theory of PDEs.

A quasilinear (hyperbolic in our case) partial differential equation
(PDE) of @xmath order in n variables @xmath for an unknown function
@xmath can be written: (See Refs. [ Gar64 ] , [ CH62 ] )

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and thus defines the differential operator @xmath .

A submanifold of dimension @xmath and equation @xmath is said to be a
characteristic manifold (surface) if its normals @xmath fulfill the
first order PDE ¹ ¹ 1 The eikonal equation of geometric optics is of
that form.

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The Cauchy problem for a @xmath order hyperbolic PDE can only be well
posed if the manifold on which the initial data is specified is not a
characteristic manifold. If it were posed on a characteristic manifold,
the PDE would only be first order in time, @xmath being an “interior”
(i.e. acting purely in the characteristic surface) differential
operator, and the @xmath derivative transversal to the initial data
surface could, in this case, not be determined. Thus, characteristic
surfaces are exactly those, on which the Cauchy problem is not
well-posed. Note that in the quasilinear case the characteristic
condition depends on the initial data, since the @xmath are, in general,
also functions of @xmath .

Characteristic surfaces are, in turn, generated by characteristic rays
or bicharacteristics , which satisfy the following equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It can be shown that the bicharacteristics of general relativity are
null geodesics which generate null hypersurfaces. We will show in
section 2.1.1 that the bicharacteristics of a massless scalar field
which is minimally coupled to gravity are null geodesics of spacetime.
Therefore, since gravitational disturbances, and, in our case,
disturbances in the massless scalar field, are propagated along null
geodesics, this makes a case for introducing a foliation of spacetime
based on a family of non-intersecting null hypersurfaces. It is also
worth noting that these disturbances need not be smooth in general, i.e.
shock waves are possible in some matter models (e.g. perfect fluids).

As a simple example consider the flat space wave equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The characteristics then have to fulfill

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

A special solution is the characteristic cone

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which represents spherical wavefronts propagating from a source located
at @xmath . The generators of the cone, which are bicharacteristics, may
be represented as light rays perpendicular to the wavefronts.

It is illuminating to compare the spacelike slices of the @xmath
formalism with a characteristic foliation based on outgoing null
hypersurfaces for the scalar wave equation @xmath in Minkowski spacetime
with polar spherical spatial coordinates @xmath .

In @xmath the result is well known:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This equation is second order in time, i.e. both the field and its time
derivative must be specified on an initial slice in order to uniquely
determine the future evolution.

In contrast, let us introduce a coordinate system @xmath based on null
cones @xmath , which are generated by a two-dimensional set of null
rays, labeled by the angles @xmath and with @xmath a radial parameter
along the rays. These coordinates will be discussed in detail in section
2.3.2 . The line element is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

so that the wave equation then becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the angular momentum operator. This equation is only
first order in the retarded time @xmath , so only the value of the field
needs to be specified on an initial slice in order to uniquely determine
the future evolution. However, the domain of dependence only extends to
the inside of the cone; i.e. the initial null surface is not a Cauchy
surface for the spacetime.

#### 2.1.1 The Bicharacteristics of a Scalar Field Coupled to Gravity

Let us consider the matter field equation for the massless scalar field
minimally coupled to gravity in spherical symmetry and assume that we
can foliate spacetime by null hypersurfaces which are labelled by a
coordinate @xmath . We will show that the bicharacteristics of the
scalar field are null geodesics of spacetime (see [ d’I92b ] ).

The matter field equation is of the form of equation ( 2.1.1 )

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and its principal part (the terms which contain the highest derivatives)
is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The coeffient matrix which appears here, the @xmath of ( 2.1.1 ), is
just the inverse spacetime metric in the (u,r)-submanifold. According to
equation ( 2.1.2 ) the @xmath hypersurfaces are characteristic manifolds
since they fulfill

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

By definition ( 2.1.3 ) the bicharacteristics which generate the @xmath
surfaces satisfy (with @xmath being a parameter along the
bicharacteristics)

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

i.e., they are the orbits of the vector field @xmath .

Now we will prove that these bicharacteristics are, in fact, null
geodesics. We take the covariant derivative in the direction of the
vector field @xmath of the last equation and find

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Thanks to the symmetry of the connection this last expression is equal
to

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where we have used that @xmath is null. Thus, the bicharacteristics of
the massless scalar field turn out to be null geodesics. This
intuitively makes sense, since the scalar field propagates at the speed
of light. We have also shown that @xmath is an affine null vector, that
is, @xmath (chosen by equation ( 2.1.13 )), is an affine parameter along
these null rays.

### 2.2 General Properties of Black Holes

In the following we give some textbook definitions of a black hole ,
both from a global and a local point of view [ Poi04 , Wal84 ] .

The causal past of an event @xmath , denoted by @xmath is the set of all
events that can be reached from @xmath by past-directed curves, either
timelike or null. The causal past of a set of events @xmath , @xmath is
the union of the causal pasts of all events @xmath .

The black hole region @xmath of the spacetime manifold @xmath is the set
of all events that do not belong to the causal past of future null
infinity:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The event horizon @xmath is defined to be the boundary of the black hole
region:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Because the event horizon is a causal boundary, it must be a null
hypersurface generated by null geodesics. Note that this definition of a
black hole depends crucially on the notion of future null infinity which
can be defined for asymptotically flat spacetimes. Moreover, to apply
this definition one has to know the entire future development of the
spacetime in question. In practice, it is often more convenient to use a
quasi-local definition of a horizon.

A trapped surface is a closed, spacelike two-dimensional surface @xmath
such that for both congruences (ingoing and outgoing) of future-directed
null geodesics orthogonal to @xmath , the expansion @xmath is negative
everywhere on @xmath .

The trapping horizon [ Hay94a ] is the three-dimensional boundary of the
region of spacetime that contains trapped surfaces. ² ² 2 A trapping
horizon is the closure @xmath of a three-surface @xmath foliated by
marginal surfaces on which @xmath and @xmath . A marginal surface is a
spatial two-surface @xmath on which one null expansion vanishes, fixed
as @xmath . The trapping horizon and marginal surfaces are said to be
outer if @xmath and future if @xmath . The concept of dynamical horizons
[ AK04 ] is closely related to trapping horizons.

The two-dimensional intersection of the trapping horizon with a
spacelike hypersurface @xmath (Cauchy surface) is called an apparent
horizon . The apparent horizon is therefore a marginally trapped surface
– a closed two-surface @xmath on which one of the congruences of
future-directed null geodesics orthogonal to @xmath has zero expansion.
³ ³ 3 For technical details see [ Wal84 ] theorem 12.2.5. Note that the
intersection of an outgoing null hypersurface with the trapping horizon
can be an apparent horizon, or a three-dimensional subset of the
trapping horizon.

The trapped region @xmath of a spacelike hypersurface @xmath is the
portion of @xmath that contains trapped surfaces.

Under certain technical conditions the black hole region contains
trapped surfaces. ⁴ ⁴ 4 For details see [ Wal84 ] proposition 12.2.3.
While for stationary black holes the trapping horizon typically
coincides with the event horizon, it lies within the black hole region
in dynamical situations (unless the null energy condition is violated.)
We will not distinguish between the two-dimensional apparent horizon and
the three-dimensional trapping horizon and will refer to both as the
apparent horizon. We also use the term “trapped region” in a different
sense as defined above, namely we refer to a region of spacetime for
which each point lies on a trapped surface [ Hay94a ] .

In the following we will restrict ourselves to future outer trapping
horizons (FOTH) and future marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS),
which require @xmath and @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath refers to the
outgoing and ingoing null congruences, respectively. A FOTH is either
spacelike or null, being null if and only if the shear of the outer null
normal as well as the matter flux across the horizon vanishes [ AK04 ] .

The apparent horizon is the outermost (future) marginally outer trapped
surface (MOTS) in a spacelike hypersurface @xmath . If one looks for
globally outermost MOTS in a Cauchy evolution, they can “jump” [ AMS05 ]
. This does not happen for an outgoing null foliation.

### 2.3 Bondi Coordinates in Spherical Symmetry

#### 2.3.1 Spherical Symmetry

By definition, the metric of a spherically symmetric spacetime possesses
three spacelike Killing vector fields, which form the Lie-algebra of
SO(3), the rotation group in three dimensions. The Killing vectors
fulfill the following commutation relations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the @xmath denote the structure constants of SO(3). The
commutators close (that is, the commutator of any two fields in the set
is a linear combination of other fields in the set), so that by
Frobenius’ theorem (see [ Wal84 ] ) the integral curves of these vector
fields “mesh” together to form submanifolds of the manifold on which
they are defined. The orbits of SO(3) are spacelike 2-spheres and the
spacetime metric induces a metric on each orbit 2-sphere.

The general form of a spherically symmetric metric is (see appendix B of
[ HE73 ] )

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a two-dimensional metric of indefinite signature @xmath
and @xmath is the canonical metric on @xmath . The coordinates @xmath
are chosen so that the group orbits of SO(3) are the surfaces @xmath and
the orthogonal surfaces are given by @xmath .

#### 2.3.2 Bondi Coordinates

In the following, we define Bondi coordinates and derive the form of the
spacetime metric. (see [ d’I92b ] and [ Pap74 ] ). We start from the
general form of a spherically symmetric metric given in equation ( 2.3.2
). We chose

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

to be a family of non-intersecting, outgoing null hypersurfaces, i.e.
@xmath . We know from section 2.1.1 that these null hypersurfaces are
generated by null geodesics (the bicharacteristics of the surfaces).
This gives us the possibility to define a second coordinate in a purely
geometrical way. We choose

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

to be a radial parameter along the outgoing null geodesics that foliate
the @xmath surfaces, i.e. on each such null ray we have @xmath and
@xmath and @xmath .

The remaining coordinates are chosen to be polar angles, coinciding with
the usual flat space definitions for

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

near the center of spherical symmetry, as we will later choose @xmath to
be central proper time. This completes our coordinate system to @xmath .

Now, we derive the form of the spacetime metric in these coordinates. An
outgoing null ray (light ray) is a coordinate curve

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where r is varying, or

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The tangent vector to such a curve @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

must be parallel to the normal vector to the @xmath hypersurfaces

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

since, in the case of a null hypersurface, the normal vector is also the
tangent and the null rays generate the @xmath hypersurfaces. Thus, we
find

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which entails

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

or equivalently

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We still have freedom in the choice of parametrization along the null
rays. Following Bondi, we choose @xmath to be an areal radial coordinate
or luminosity distance, so that the surface area of @xmath , @xmath
2-spheres equals @xmath . ⁵ ⁵ 5 Other possible choices include an affine
parametrization of the outgoing null rays, as used by Newman and Penrose
in their work on gravitational radiation [ NP62 ] . An affine radial
coordinate entails by definition

@xmath

which leads to

@xmath

For null coordinates in spherical symmetry the only nonzero contribution
comes from

@xmath

A vanishing of @xmath and thus diverging of @xmath would make the metric
singular, therefore the condition to be satisfied is

@xmath

According to the general form of a spherically symmetric metric given in
equation ( 2.3.2 ), the line element must then be of the following form

@xmath (2.3.13)

This choice can be enforced by the condition

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Note that in spherical symmetry, the areal @xmath -coordinate is defined
in a geometrically unique way ( [ Hay96 ] ). It is also possible to
compactify the radial coordinate; we discuss this in detail in section
3.6 .

Putting these requirements together, we find that the line element
reduces to the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Since @xmath is Lorentzian, we can choose @xmath to be timelike, i.e.

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We write the metric in the following way, adhering to Bondi’s
conventions for the names of the metric functions

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is assumed in order that @xmath be timelike.

So the metric and inverse metric are

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

respectively.

The sign of @xmath is due to our use of a retarded null-coordinate
@xmath . In section 2.3.4 we will choose @xmath to be proper time at the
origin which implies that the metric reduces to the following flat
metric at the origin

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

One can also check that this is consistent with the signature @xmath by
introducing a time coordinate @xmath in flat space, so that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

For purposes of comparison, we can also introduce an advanced
null-coordinate @xmath in flat space, and find

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In the context of Bondi coordinates, we often write partial derivatives
of some function @xmath with respect to @xmath and @xmath as @xmath and
@xmath , repectively.

#### 2.3.3 Physical Interpretation of the Bondi Metric

To improve physical understanding, it is worthwhile to analyze the Bondi
metric in some further detail.

First, let us take a look at the tangent and normal vectors as shown in
table 2.1 . By construction, we have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

i.e., @xmath lies in the u=const null surfaces. Or, to put it
differently, these null rays generate the @xmath null hypersurfaces.

Observe also that if @xmath is positive, then @xmath is a timelike
surface and @xmath is also timelike. If @xmath , both are null, and if
@xmath both are spacelike. Correspondingly, @xmath is spacelike, null or
timelike.

The particular choice of the algebraic form of the metric components
serves the simplicity of the resulting Einstein equations. The functions
@xmath and @xmath also have simple physical interpretations. As will be
shown in section 2.3.4 @xmath measures the redshift between an
asymptotic coordinate frame of reference and the center of spherical
symmetry. @xmath is the analog of the Newtonian potential and contains
the Bondi-mass in its asymptotic expansion.

We define ingoing and outgoing null directions @xmath by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which is an affine null vector, i.e. @xmath . For an affine null vector
the null expansion @xmath can be defined by (see chapter 9 of [ Wal84 ]
)

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We find

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

If @xmath along an outgoing null ray, the surface area of 2-spheres
increases and neighboring null rays diverge. Since @xmath is positive
definite unless @xmath diverges, the occurrence of marginally outer
trapped surfaces, @xmath for some sphere, cannot happen in outgoing
Bondi coordinates. Thus, we cannot penetrate apparent horizons (see 2.2
).

Nevertheless, as we come close to an apparent horizon, our slices will
asymptote to it (see figures 2.2 and 2.3 ) and ultimately, as @xmath ,
@xmath will cease to be a good coordinate; it will no longer be a
monotonically increasing function of the advanced null coordinate @xmath
which is defined by @xmath , i.e. the curves @xmath are the ingoing
null-geodesics and @xmath on the initial slice. (In flat space @xmath .)
Tiny numerical errors may lead to the bending over of the slices and
thus crash the code.

The radial ingoing null geodesics are given by integration of the
equation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.28)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Accordingly, the total derivative of any scalar quantity @xmath with
respect to @xmath along an ingoing null geodesic is given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Since this is a Lie-derivative with respect to a non-coordinate vector
field, it will in general not commute with partial derivatives like
@xmath .

#### 2.3.4 Gauge and Regularity Conditions at the Origin

Assume that there is a regular center at @xmath (no eternal black or
white holes or naked singularities), so that we can designate a finite
geodesic line segment of a central observer at @xmath as our spatial
origin. We fix the gauge such that the family of outgoing null cones
emanating from the center is parametrized by the proper time ⁶ ⁶ 6 With
our choice of Lorentz signature @xmath , the proper time of a timelike
curve @xmath with tangent @xmath and curve parameter @xmath is given by

@xmath

, @xmath , of this central observer. This choice is taken since we are
interested in the “echoing region” near the center of spherical
symmetry, where oscillations in the fields will pile up if we are near
to the “critical solution”. Another common gauge is to choose @xmath as
the proper time of an observer at future null infinity, @xmath . This
asymptotically flat time coordinate is the usual choice if one is
interested in asymptotics.

Choosing @xmath as proper time at the origin implies the condition

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.30)
  -- -------- -- ----------

while a regular center, as defined by [ Hay96 ] , requires @xmath ,
which in turn entails

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.31)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Together theses requirements imply local flatness and regularity of the
metric, that is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.32)
  -- -------- -- ----------

at a fixed retarded time @xmath . These smoothness conditions are
rederived in section 2.3.4 .

##### Relation between Central and Bondi Time

In the following, @xmath will always denote central time - proper time
at the center of spherical symmetry, whereas we denote the
asymptotically flat Bondi time by @xmath . The relation between the two
time coordinates can easily be derived by comparing with an
asymptotically flat (standard Bondi) frame (see section 3.6.1 ). For
large @xmath the line elements behave as

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.3.33)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.3.34)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

which yields in the limit @xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.35)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath and @xmath .

The following more geometrical argument yields the same result: In
general @xmath , but under the following assumptions we can show that
@xmath only. We demand that

  -- -- -- ----------
           (2.3.36)
  -- -- -- ----------

and

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.37)
  -- -------- -- ----------

i.e. @xmath are null hypersurfaces.

We find

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.38)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which yields

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.39)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Thus @xmath only. Now we have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.40)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Since @xmath is proper time at infinity,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.41)
  -- -------- -- ----------

plugging ( 2.3.40 ) in to the metric yields

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.42)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Therefore, @xmath and we have found the desired relation between central
and Bondi time:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.43)
  -- -------- -- ----------

##### Redshift

Consider a freely falling observer located at @xmath whose worldline is
tangent to the timelike geodesic parametrized by proper time at the
origin @xmath with tangent @xmath . He sends out a light signal which
propagates along the affinely parametrized outgoing radial null geodesic
with tangent @xmath (As shown in section 2.1.1 , @xmath is an affine
null vector). The signal is received by an observer whose worldline is
tangent to a timelike geodesic at @xmath , parametrized by proper time
at infinity @xmath with tangent @xmath .

The frequency (see Ref. [ Wal84 ] ) of an emitted wave is given by minus
the inner product of the wave vector (which is just the rate of change
of the phase of the wave) with the 4-velocity of the observer. The
frequency of emission at the center is given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.44)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The frequency of reception at infinity is, using the relation between
central and Bondi time ( 2.3.35 ),

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.45)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The redshift-factor is defined as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.46)
  -- -------- -- ----------

For small @xmath we thus have @xmath .

Now, because of the hypersurface equations (see section 3.3 ) and gauge
choice for @xmath , the metric functions, @xmath and @xmath , are both
monotonically increasing in the direction of increasing @xmath and both
are positive definite. Thus @xmath and

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.47)
  -- -------- -- ----------

always, which is just the condition for signals to be redshifted. In the
case of horizon formation @xmath , however, @xmath will tend to
infinity, so that light rays can no longer escape to infinity and the
redshift will diverge exponentially until our coordinates break down.

A crude argument for the redshift is also apparent just from the
relation ( 2.3.35 ). If @xmath , a finite amount of central time @xmath
corresponds to an infinite amount of Bondi time @xmath and thus light
signals originating from the center are infinitely redshifted.

##### Derivation of Regularity Conditions at the Origin of Spherical
Symmetry

In this section we apply the general procedure for deriving regularity
conditions set forth by Bardeen and Piran in [ BP83 ] . Although the
latter deals with axisymmetric systems, it is nevertheless worthwhile to
study this approach in the simpler setting of spherical symmetry.

A tensorial quantity is called regular at @xmath if and only if its
components relative to Cartesian coordinates can be expanded in
non-negative integer powers ⁷ ⁷ 7 Otherwise the tensorial quantity or
its derivatives will blow up at @xmath . of x, y and z; i.e. one demands
the existence of a Taylor series expansion in Cartesian coordinates. We
would like to derive what restrictions this assumption of regularity at
the origin implies for the metric functions @xmath and @xmath as
functions of @xmath .

We will work in a regular @xmath coordinate system with @xmath defined
as @xmath . ⁸ ⁸ 8 Note that the coordinates @xmath are not regular: The
vector fields @xmath , @xmath and @xmath all have a kink at the origin.
Since we have taken @xmath to be proper time at the origin, @xmath also
measures proper time at @xmath . We also enforce local flatness at the
center, i.e. the metric goes to the Minkowski metric as @xmath tends to
@xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.48)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We will have to investigate which derivatives of the metric functions
are allowed to be non-zero and which are zero by regularity.

The relations between the two coordinate systems are:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --

The Jacobian for this coordinate transformation is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.49)
  -- -------- -- ----------

First we need to calculate the components of the metric in @xmath
coordinates. Some interesting components as functions of the polar
coordinates are

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.50)
  -- -------- -- ----------

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.51)
  -- -------- -- ----------

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.52)
  -- -------- -- ----------

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.53)
  -- -------- -- ----------

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.54)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We will also need derivatives of the metric. Since the derivatives of
@xmath and @xmath are particularly messy and we do not need to consider
them, we leave them out.

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.55)
  -- -------- -- ----------

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.56)
  -- -------- -- ----------

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.57)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We make the following series ansatz for the metric functions @xmath and
@xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.3.58)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.3.59)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

This yields

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.3.60)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.3.61)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.3.62)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

We now impose the local flatness gauge condition ( 2.3.48 ).

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.63)
  -- -------- -- ----------

yields

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.64)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Similarly, we have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.65)
  -- -------- -- ----------

from which we find

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.66)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and thus, it follows from ( 2.3.64 ) that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.67)
  -- -------- -- ----------

One does not need to consider any other equations, since the two
constant terms in ( 2.3.58 ) have now been determined. Indeed, one can
also check that @xmath and @xmath are fulfilled.

The series that respect this gauge choice are

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.3.68)
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

We are now in a position to investigate limits ( @xmath ) of the
derivatives of the metric. The values should remain finite and be
direction independent, i.e. independent of the spherical angles @xmath
and @xmath , since these are indefinite at the origin. This will then
provide us with conditions on the series expansions of @xmath and @xmath
. Consequently, we find from ( 2.3.55 ), the equation for @xmath , that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.69)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Applying the expansions ( 2.3.4 ), we find

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.70)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and eventually

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.71)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Similarly, we find from ( 2.3.57 ), the equation for @xmath , that

  -- -- -- ----------
           (2.3.72)
  -- -- -- ----------

Here, we can set all terms proportional to @xmath to zero and insert the
series expansions ( 2.3.4 ). We find

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.73)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which leads to the condition

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.74)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Combining the two conditions ( 2.3.71 ) and ( 2.3.74 ) we recover

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.3.75)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.3.76)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

We did not consider @xmath , since it is already well behaved because of
the gauge condition alone. For @xmath the calculation would have been
more involved but would have led to the same result.

Summarizing, we have found that the metric functions @xmath and @xmath
guarantee that the metric is regular at the center of spherical symmetry
if they satisfy, at a fixed retarded time @xmath ,

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

These regularity conditions are consistent with the hypersurface
equation ( 3.3.3 ), @xmath , derived in chapter 3.3 .

The conditions we have derived are sufficiently accurate for our
purposes, though one could consider higher derivatives of the metric. We
will see from the following simple argument that, in fact, all odd
derivatives of the metric functions have to vanish at the origin.

Without loss of generality, define linear distance @xmath by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.78)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We demand that the metric does not have a kink as the origin is crossed
along a ray parametrized by linear distance @xmath . If a metric
function @xmath contains a linear term in its Taylor expansion around
the origin, then

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.79)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is a constant.

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.80)
  -- -------- -- ----------

has a jump discontinuity and is thus not regular. It will be regular
provided that the constant @xmath vanishes. This is equivalent to the
condition that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.81)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Note that this argument can be extended to higher derivatives. Roughly
speaking, each time one applies @xmath to a function @xmath , @xmath
reverses its sign for @xmath . Therefore, all derivatives of an odd
order have to vanish at the origin, so that a regular function of @xmath
will have a Taylor series which contains only even terms in @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.82)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In addition, we can also derive the Taylor series expansion for the
scalar field by making use of the hypersurface equation ( 3.3.2 ) @xmath
and find that there is no restriction on @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.83)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In this respect it is also interesting to view this last fact from a
different perspective: When working in polar coordinate systems, the
d’Alembertian usually contains terms similar to @xmath . Regularity of
the field @xmath at the origin then amounts to requiring that @xmath
vanishes. But using a null coordinate @xmath makes a difference. There
is now a rivaling @xmath term in the d’Alembertian ( A.0.22 ) which
happens to cancel the other term at the origin.

#### 2.3.5 Historical Notes on the Bondi Coordinate System

The original motivation for Bondi and his co-workers (see [ HB62 ] ) in
developing this coordinate system was to analyze radiation from an
isolated system. To do so, one needed to deal with expansions in
negative powers of a radial distance for various quantities. Such a
treatment is, however, made impossible by the appearance of logarithmic
terms in @xmath , as is the case, in Schwarzschild coordinates.

Later, the conformal compactification of null infinity @xmath allowed a
geometrized description of the asymptotic physical properties of
radiative spacetimes. This novel technique also proved very beneficial
for the study of gravitational radiation, see e.g. [ Fra04 ] .

One demands that in a region from @xmath inwards the coordinate system
should be non-singular. Farther in, null rays will, in general, focus
and cross, forming caustics and causing the coordinates to break down
and become singular. ⁹ ⁹ 9 Except for the case where there exists a
second regular center, where rays may caustic, this cannot happen in
spherical symmetry, because the lightrays are ’running’ after each other
but never touch. A second regular center is however ruled out by the
assumed existence of future null infinity @xmath . The only caustic that
is present in spherical symmetry is a point caustic at the center
itself, which has to be handled by regularity conditions on the metric
and the matter fields. Of course, for nontrivial topologies the
situation is entirely different: e.g. on the Einstein cylinder lightrays
may form caustics.

The Bondi-like coordinates defined in section 2.3.2 cover all of
spacetime provided there are no caustics or singularities and @xmath
exists. ¹⁰ ¹⁰ 10 For the existence of @xmath , which is a part of
conformal infinity, the spacetime metric has to satisfy certain falloff
conditions, i.e. it must tend to a flat metric sufficiently fast as one
goes to infinity in an outgoing null direction. In a coordinate
independent formulation a spacetime is said to be asymptotically flat,
if the physical spacetime can be mapped into a new, “unphysical”
spacetime via a conformal isometry which has to satisfy certain, very
technical conditions. Details can be found in chapter 11 of Ref. [ Wal84
] .

### 2.4 Double-Null Coordinates

As we have seen in section 2.3.3 , outgoing Bondi coordinates cannot
penetrate apparent horizons, because the areal radial coordinate @xmath
fails to be a good coordinate when an AH forms: @xmath . A coordinate
system which does not suffer from this deficiency and is suitable for
spherically symmetric critical collapse evolutions are double-null
coordinates .

In addition to the retarded null-coordinate @xmath which is constant on
outgoing light rays, we now introduce an advanced null-coordinate @xmath
, which is constant on ingoing light rays and replaces @xmath as a
coordinate. Along with the standard polar coordinates on the group
orbits of SO(3), @xmath , the coordinate chart becomes @xmath . The line
element is then of the following form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.4.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The area radius @xmath is now a metric function that depends on the null
coordinates. The double-null form is natural in the sense that each
two-sphere possesses two preferred normal directions, the null
directions @xmath and @xmath .

The components of the metric and inverse metric are given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.4.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.4.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and the metric determinant is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.4.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

A relation between Bondi coordinates and double-null coordinates can be
established by a coordinate transformation (see Ref. [ PL04 ] ) of the
form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.4.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with an integrating factor @xmath .

The line-element is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.4.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In the new coordinates @xmath and we can introduce a metric function
@xmath , so that @xmath and the line-element becomes equation ( 2.4.1 ).

Since @xmath we have the relations

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.4.7)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.4.8)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

In the context of double-null coordinates we denote partial derivatives
of some function @xmath with respect to @xmath and @xmath by @xmath and
@xmath , respectively.

#### 2.4.1 Null Expansions

To compute marginally trapped surfaces we compute the null expansions
(see Ref. [ Wal84 ] )

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.4.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the affine ingoing and outgoing null vectors @xmath are defined
through their covectors as

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.4.10)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.4.11)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

This yields

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.4.12)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.4.13)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

It is easy to check that the @xmath are indeed affine null vectors, that
is @xmath and that the null expansions @xmath are given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.14)
     @xmath      (2.4.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The signs of the null expansions are geometrical invariants, while their
actual values are not [ Hay96 ] . For future marginally outer trapped
surfaces (MOTS) (see section 2.2 ) we need to have @xmath while @xmath .
Since the denominators in equations ( 2.4.14 ) and ( 2.4.15 ) are
non-negative, the sign of the null expansions is determined by the
quantities @xmath and @xmath and it suffices to check the conditions
@xmath while @xmath .

The possible presence of multiple MOTS on an evolution hypersurface
depends on the slicing. For outgoing null slices, there cannot be more
than one MOTS on a slice, whereas for spacelike slices there can be. The
geometric property of future outer trapping horizons being spacelike or
null (the latter only if there is no more infalling matter when
following the null geodesic generators further outwards), but never
timelike, applied to the intersection of an MOTS with an outgoing
null-slice shows that we cannot have multiple MOTS on such a null-slice,
which is equivalent to the function @xmath having at most one zero.

#### 2.4.2 Gauge Choice

The form of the metric is preserved under diffeomorphisms @xmath and
@xmath . We fix this residual gauge freedom present in the null
coordinates @xmath and @xmath by choosing

-   @xmath to be at @xmath

-   @xmath .

## Chapter 3 The Continuum Problem

We consider the coupled spherically symmetric Einstein-massless scalar
field system, both in Bondi and in double-null coordinates. After
deriving the Einstein equations and the curved space wave equation for
the scalar field, we analyze the evolution systems and formulate the
characteristic initial value problem to be solved. We also discuss
compactification for Bondi coordinates and highlight some quantities of
physical interest which we will use in the numerical evolution codes
described in the following chapter.

### 3.1 Einstein’s Equations

To derive Einstein’s equations we start with the action functional which
consists of the Einstein-Hilbert action plus the matter action:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath denotes the Ricci scalar and the Lagrangian density of the
massless scalar (Klein-Gordon) field is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Variation of the total action ( 3.1.1 ) with respect to the spacetime
metric yields the Einstein equations,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is the energy momentum tensor of the massless scalar field obtained via
variation of the matter action with respect to the spacetime metric.

To complete the system, variation of the matter action with respect to
the scalar field @xmath yields the matter field equation, the curved
wave equation for the massless scalar field

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The Einstein and Ricci tensors in outgoing Bondi coordinates @xmath are
given in appendix A along with the Christoffel symbols, while the tensor
components for double-null coordinates are given in appendix B .

### 3.2 Hierarchy of Einstein Equations in Bondi Coordinates

In spherical symmetry, the four algebraically independent Einstein
equations, the @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath components of
equation ( 3.1.3 ), are not differentially independent.

Essentially, we have four equations for two unknown metric functions,
@xmath and @xmath . In principle, one could freely choose two of these
equations and complement them with the matter field equation to complete
the evolution system. Numerical considerations dictate, however, a
preference for the constraint equations (which here act in the outgoing
null hypersurfaces, i.e. they are ODEs in the radial coordinate @xmath
). Choosing these two hypersurface equations instead of the other
wave-type Einstein equations naturally ensures enforcement of the
constraints. Unconstrained (or free) evolution systems let the solutions
drift off the constraint surface of the Einstein equations and may
excite numerical unstable modes, while constrained evolution cuts back
on numerical constraint violations and offers greater stability.

There is an analysis of the Einstein equations for the original
axissymmetric vacuum Bondi problem according to which the equations
decompose into the following sets (see Refs. [ HB62 ] and [ d’I92b ] ):

-   four main equations :

    -   dynamical equation :

          -- -------- -- ---------
             @xmath      (3.2.1)
          -- -------- -- ---------

    -   hypersurface equations :

          -- -------- -- ---------
             @xmath      (3.2.2)
          -- -------- -- ---------

        where @xmath . They contain only derivatives that act in the
        @xmath hypersurfaces

-   symmetry conditions :

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (3.2.3)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    These components vanish identically because of axisymmetry.

-   trivial equation :

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (3.2.4)
      -- -------- -- ---------

-   supplementary (conservation) conditions (for energy and angular
    momentum)

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (3.2.5)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    If they are imposed on a world line, the conservation conditions
    reduce to regularity conditions on the vertices of the null cones.
    They are the analog with respect to an r-foliation of the 3+1
    momentum constraints.

It follows by the Bianchi identities that, if the main equations are
satisfied, the trivial equation is automatically fulfilled and the
conservation conditions are satisfied on a complete outgoing null-cone
if they hold on a single spherical cross-section (e.g. at infinity).

Our situation is, of course, entirely different, we work in spherical
symmetry and have a matter field coupled to gravity. Still, one might
expect to obtain some useful insights into the hierarchy of the
equations by attempting a similar analysis. We now show how Einstein’s
equations split into hypersurface equations, and equations which are
automatically satisfied if certain conditions are met.

In the context of Bondi coordinates, we often abbreviate partial
derivatives of a function @xmath with respect to @xmath and @xmath by
@xmath and @xmath , respectively.

The hypersurface equations follow indeed from straightforward analogues
of equations ( 3.2.2 ):

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

yields

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

while from ¹ ¹ 1 We may rewrite Einstein’s equations as @xmath , where
@xmath is the trace of the energy momentum tensor of the scalar field.

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

we have, using equation ( A.0.21 ),

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and finally ² ² 2 Equation ( 3.2.10 ) can also be derived from the
@xmath component of Einstein’s equations when plugging in equation (
3.2.7 ).

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The dynamical equation ( 3.2.1 ) is satisfied if the hypersurface
equations ( 3.2.7 ) and ( 3.2.10 ) hold everywhere and the energy
momentum tensor is covariantly divergence free: Inserting the
hypersurface equations in equation ( 3.2.1 ) leads to

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This equation is satisfied if @xmath .

Clearly, this equation cannot contribute to the dynamics in our setting,
since in spherical symmetry there are no gravitational degrees of
freedom and the dynamics resides entirely in the matter field. ³ ³ 3
Birhoff’s theorem shows that a spherically symmetric vacuum solution is
necessarily static. The conservation of mass and angular momentum in
general relativity prohibits the existence of spherically symmetric and
of dipole waves in the gravitational field. The lowest possible symmetry
is that of a quadrupole which already requires at least axisymmetry.

The symmetry conditions, equations ( 3.2.3 ), vanish identically because
of spherical symmetry. What remains to be discussed is the analogue of
the trivial equation, equation ( 3.2.4 ), @xmath and one of the
conservation conditions ( 3.2.5 ), @xmath .

The trivial equation is satisfied if the hypersurface equations ( 3.2.7
) and ( 3.2.10 ) hold everywhere:

  -- -- -- ----------
           (3.2.12)
  -- -- -- ----------

Assuming that the hypersurface equations ( 3.2.7 ) and ( 3.2.10 ) hold
everywhere, the conservation condition @xmath can be rewritten as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

At the world line of the central observer, @xmath , this equation is
satisfied if the regularity conditions, equations ( 2.3.4 ), imposed by
spherical symmetry hold. The @xmath - component of the contracted
Bianchi identities @xmath , which must also hold for the energy momentum
tensor as a consequence of the Einstein equations, yields the following
equation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where we use the shorthand @xmath . Since we have already shown that
@xmath everywhere, we have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and thus

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Combined with @xmath at @xmath , we have shown that @xmath everywhere.

If one considers the set of hypersurface equations plus the matter field
wave equation, it is apparent that three integration constants will be
necessary to carry out an actual time evolution. These constants have
been fixed by our choice of proper time at the origin. Otherwise, for
asymptotically flat coordinates, as in Bondi’s original work, one
chooses the integration constants at infinity. In section 3.6.1 will
make an acquaintance with these integration constants (which in our
gauge are functions of @xmath ) and we will see that the conservation
condition @xmath imposed at future null infinity, @xmath , yields a
differential relation between two of them, the Bondi mass-loss equation.

### 3.3 Field Equations for the Gravitating Massless Scalar Field

Given the massless scalar (Klein-Gordon) field, all gravitational
quantities can be determined by integration along the characteristics of
the null foliation, since the matter field is the only dynamical field
in spherical symmetry and needs to be included to make the system
non-Schwarzschild. This is a coupled problem since the scalar wave
equation involves the curved space metric.

The field equations consist of the wave equation for the scalar field

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and two hypersurface equations for the metric functions:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Note that both @xmath and @xmath are monotonic in @xmath . Combined with
the gauge conditions imposed in section 2.3.4 monotonicity implies

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.3.4)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.3.5)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

In spherical symmetry the curved space d’Alembertian ⁴ ⁴ 4 This can
easily be obtained by using the formula @xmath and setting @xmath . is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We will now derive a useful relation between the four-dimensional wave
operator and the wave operator in the two-dimensional (u,r) submanifold.
The intrinsic metric in the (u,r) submanifold is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and thus the two-dimensional d’Alembertian follows as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Now we introduce a rescaled field which factors out the known falloff of
@xmath at large @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It is then straightforward to derive the following identity:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and use this to write the wave equation @xmath as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The motivation for introducing the rescaled field @xmath is the
following: The amplitude of an outgoing spherical wave packet decreases
with @xmath , a rescaled field @xmath thus behaves similarly to a plane
wave. Indeed the following identity holds: In the flat background case,
the field @xmath satisfies the usual @xmath -dimensional wave equation
@xmath . Thanks to the plane wave behavior of @xmath , numerical
accuracy is expected to benefit for large @xmath since the amplitude of
the wave does not change as fast.

There exist two standard algorithms for solving the wave equation based
on this identity, which will henceforth be called the
Piran-Goldwirth-Garfinkle (PGG) and the NSWE (North-South-West-East)
“diamond” algorithm which are described in sections 3.4 and 3.5 ,
respectively.

### 3.4 The PGG Evolution Algorithm

Here we briefly discuss a characteristic evolution scheme due to Piran,
Goldwirth and Garfinkle [ GP87 ] , [ Gar95 ] . We essentially follow the
original algorithm although the terminology is slightly different.

It is useful to define the quantity

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.4.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

so that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.4.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The wave equation ( 3.3.11 ) in @xmath coordinates then becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.4.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

According to equation ( 2.3.28 ), the left hand side can be written as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.4.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

if the radial positions follow null geodesics.

The evolution system is thus formed by the ODE’s ( 3.4.1 , 3.4.4 ,
2.3.28 ).

### 3.5 The Gomez-Winicour “Diamond” Algorithm

The basic idea of this algorithm (see Refs. [ GW92b ] , [ GW92c ] , [
Win05 ] ) is to integrate the wave equation over the null parallelogram
@xmath spanned by the points N, S, W, and E (see figure 3.1 on page 3.1
). Using the identity ( 3.3.11 ) and the volume element @xmath We have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.5.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The crucial trick of the whole undertaking is the following: Since h is
a two-dimensional metric, it is conformally flat. As we will shortly
see, @xmath has conformal weight ⁵ ⁵ 5 See [ Wal84 ] Appendix D for a
definition. @xmath whereas the surface area element @xmath has conformal
weight @xmath . Thus, the surface integral over @xmath is identical to
the flat space result which can easily be obtained.

Let @xmath be a conformal rescaling of the metric @xmath . First we need
to know how the determinant of the metric transforms under conformal
transformations. For a two-dimensional metric @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and therefore

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

i.e. the volume element in two dimensions has conformal weight @xmath .
The formula for the d’Alembertian is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Applying the previous result yields

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

i.e. the two-dimensional d’Alembertian has conformal weight -2. So, all
in all we can rewrite the original surface integral in the following
manner:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The flat two-dimensional (Minkowsi-)metric @xmath can be rewritten in
double-null coordinates as @xmath . The metric is @xmath So that the
d’Alembertian becomes @xmath . Now our integral can easily be evaluated:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where we have introduced the grid points @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and
@xmath as shown in figure 3.1

Using ( 3.3.11 ) and the volume element @xmath , the wave equation can
thus be written as

  -- -- -- ---------
           (3.5.2)
  -- -- -- ---------

### 3.6 Compactification of the Radial Coordinate

Compactification is rather simple for characteristic codes, and has been
used extensively in the characteristic approach to numerical relativity
[ GW92b , GW92a , GW92c , Win05 ] .

The type of compactification we pursue here is not conformal
compactification per se (see Ref. [ Fra04 ] for a review), where the
spacetime manifold is completed by “attaching” a boundary at “infinity”.
The method of conformal compactification maps physical spacetime onto a
bounded open region of unphysical spacetime, introduces an unphysical
metric via a conformal rescaling @xmath ( @xmath approaches zero (at
infinity) at an appropriate rate), and factors out known asymptotic
behavior of geometrical quantities by a conformal transformation.

Rather, we use an ad-hoc regularization adapted to the simple geometry
which could be related to conformal rescalings [ Hus07 ] . We employ a
simple coordinate transformation with respect to the radial coordinate,
which maps a half-infinite domain @xmath to a compact interval @xmath .
In this ad-hoc approach the metric is not altered (no unphysical metric
is introduced) and the evolution equations “notice where infinity is”
because they degenerate there [ Fra04 ] . The advantage of this
compactification method are its simplicity and that we can evolve till
future null infinity, @xmath and thus study global and radiative
properties of collapse spacetimes in detail.

We would like to emphasize that the use of conformal rescalings does not
imply that one has to employ the rather difficult framework of
Friedrich’s regular conformal Einstein equations [ Fri81 ] . In fact
such an approach has also been suggested in [ And02 , HSVZ05 ] .

Before introducing compactification we want to say a few words about
asymptotic series expansions.

#### 3.6.1 Asymptotic Series Expansions for the Massless Scalar Field

Assuming initial data that are smooth at @xmath , one can expand the
massless scalar field @xmath in powers of @xmath near @xmath ⁶ ⁶ 6 A
constant term in the expansion of @xmath has been omitted since one can
trivially rescale the coupled Einstein massless scalar field system: A
transformation @xmath leaves @xmath invariant.

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.6.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The coefficient @xmath of the @xmath - term in the expansion is a
Newman-Penrose constant [ NP68 ] of the scalar field.

Inserting the expansion ( 3.6.1 ) into the hypersurface equations (
3.3.2 ) and ( 3.3.3 ) yields

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.6.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.6.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where integration constants @xmath and @xmath have been introduced.

@xmath indicates redshift since Bondi time @xmath is related to proper
time at the center via the relation ( 2.3.35 ).

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.6.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is the Bondi mass which is in general not conserved. In terms of the
Misner-Sharp mass-function defined in section 3.7.1 we have the relation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.6.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and the asymptotic expansion

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.6.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

#### 3.6.2 Compactified Evolution Scheme

First, we introduce a compactified radial coordinate, then we
recalculate our evolution equations and aim to regularize them at null
infinity.

Starting with our standard Bondi-like coordinates (u,r, @xmath , @xmath
) we introduce a compactified radial coordinate

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.6.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which maps @xmath , so that points at @xmath are automatically included
in the grid at @xmath . Consequently, we have the relations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.6.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The line element, equation ( 2.3.17 ), then becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.6.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which evidently contains singular terms. Regularity, however, only
requires that the field equation for the scalar field and the
hypersurface equations for the metric functions be well behaved.

A naive approach of rewriting the hypersurface equations in terms of the
@xmath -coordinate leads to a singular equation for the quantity @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.6.10)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.6.11)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

while the equation for @xmath is fine.

The introduction of a renormalized quantity @xmath (chosen such that
@xmath ) lets us rewrite the hypersurface equation ( 3.6.11 ) in the
following form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which remedies the situation somewhat. Still, it is not obvious that
@xmath is well behaved at @xmath , since the denominator of equation (
3.6.12 ) tends to zero. An asymptotic expansion shows that @xmath is
nonsingular,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

but the cancellation in the numerator of ( 3.6.12 ) that brings about
this result is very delicate in numerical terms.

As described in [ PHA05 ] , to obtain a fully regular system of
evolution equations, we eliminate @xmath (or @xmath ) by the
Misner-Sharp mass-function

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which satisfies

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The set of hypersurface equations then becomes:

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

These equations are now completely regular. Note that the term @xmath
does not cause problems because of the smoothness of the metric at the
regular center ( 2.3.4 ).

In section 4.1.1 , we will choose our gridpoints to freely fall along
ingoing radial null geodesics @xmath which fulfill

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In section 4.1.3 we will argue that this choice is crucial to resolve
DSS phenomena.

For @xmath the matter field equation takes the form

  -- -- -- ----------
           (3.6.18)
  -- -- -- ----------

At @xmath this reduces to the ODE

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The diamond scheme can be derived by applying the transformation to the
x-coordinate to equation ( 3.5.2 ), which yields

  -- -- -- ----------
           (3.6.20)
  -- -- -- ----------

Equations ( 3.6.2 ) and ( 3.6.20 ) now form a manifestly nonsingular set
of evolution equations for the massless scalar field coupled to gravity.

The gauge and regularity conditions ( 2.3.4 ) outlined in section 2.3.4
and the regularity of the scalar field @xmath ( 2.3.83 ) along with the
definition of the rescaled field @xmath , equation ( 3.3.9 ) now become

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In section 4.1.2 we discuss Taylor expansions in the vicinity of the
origin.

### 3.7 Diagnostics

#### 3.7.1 The Misner-Sharp Mass

In spherical symmetry, there exists a well defined notion of quasilocal
energy, the Misner-Sharp mass-function (see Refs. [ MS64 ] and [ Hay96 ]
):

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.7.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which in outgoing Bondi coordinates yields

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.7.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Note that @xmath is a smooth function. The Misner-Sharp mass measures
the energy content of a sphere of radius @xmath and reduces the ADM and
Bondi masses in the appropriate limits. We also refer to the
Misner-Sharp mass-function defined in equation ( 3.7.2 ) as @xmath , in
order to distinguish it from an integral expression for the local mass,
@xmath which we define below.

We write equation ( 3.7.2 ) as an integral along outgoing radial null
geodesics @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.7.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and then use Einstein’s equations to simplify the integrand:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.7.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Since @xmath is a form of local energy density, we refer to its integral
@xmath (defined by equation ( 3.7.3 )) as the “integrated-scalar-field
mass-function”.

On the continuum level, the mass-functions @xmath and @xmath are clearly
identical, but numerically they will in general differ by a small amount
due to having different finite differencing errors; their difference is
a good “diagnostic” of the code’s accuracy.

To this end, we define

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.7.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the total mass of our initial slice, i.e. the
mass-function at the outer grid boundary on the initial slice. @xmath is
a dimensionless measure of how well our field variables satisfy the
Einstein equations; we must have @xmath everywhere in the grid at all
times for our results to be trustworthy.

#### 3.7.2 The Bondi Mass and the News Function

Taking the limit of the Misner-Sharp mass-function, @xmath , as @xmath
at constant @xmath , we obtain the Bondi mass:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.7.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In an isolated system outgoing waves can radiate physical energy to
future null infinity, @xmath . Therefore, the Bondi mass is in general
not conserved in retarded time. (In contrast, the ADM mass, which is
defined by taking the limit of @xmath as @xmath at constant @xmath ,
that is, on a spatial slice, is conserved in @xmath .)

Moreover, one can show (see Ref. [ Wal84 ] ) that there exists a flux
@xmath such that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.7.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a cross-section of @xmath with a @xmath null
hypersurface and @xmath is a real interval.

We will derive a relation between the outgoing radiation flux, which is
described in terms of the scalar news function, and the change of the
Bondi mass in time. This relation is known as the Bondi mass-loss
equation . (As always, @xmath denotes central time and not Bondi time.
The two time coordinates are related by equation ( 2.3.35 ).)

We insert the asymptotic series expansions of the fields @xmath and
@xmath , given in equations ( 3.6.1 ), ( 3.6.2 ) and ( 3.6.3 ),
respectively, into the @xmath -component of the Einstein equations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.7.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.7.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

As it turns out, the third and the fourth terms are crucial, all the
other terms are at least @xmath or cancel out. We find

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.7.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Now, we introduce the scalar news function as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.7.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Combining the last two equations yields the Bondi mass-loss equation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.7.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In Bondi time, it becomes, using relation ( 2.3.35 ),

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.7.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

From equation ( 3.7.7 ) we find

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.7.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Thus, the square of the news function is just the flux that appears in
the integral ( 3.7.7 ):

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.7.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The positivity of the flux-function @xmath entails that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.7.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

always. “News”, that is radiation, can only decrease the Bondi mass
contained on a collection of null-slices that extend to @xmath . But the
Bondi mass can never increase to the future.

#### 3.7.3 The Bondi Mass as a Linkage Integral

Let @xmath be a generator of an asymptotic time-translation and let
@xmath be a one-parameter family of spheres which approach the
cross-section @xmath of @xmath . Then the Bondi mass is defined as (see
Refs. [ GW81 ] and [ Wal84 ] )

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.7.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the gauge condition @xmath must be fulfilled in a neighborhood of
@xmath . For the Bondi metric, equation ( 2.3.17 ), the condition @xmath
gives

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.7.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

if @xmath . The generator of (asymptotic) time translations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.7.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

satisfies the vanishing divergence condition as can be verified by
making use of the asymptotic expansions for @xmath and @xmath given in
section 3.6.1 . Now the integrand of equation ( 3.7.17 ) is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.7.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

so that one obtains

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.7.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the @xmath coefficient in the asymptotic expansion of
@xmath .

#### 3.7.4 The Ricci Scalar Curvature

From the Einstein equations ( 3.1.3 ) for a minimally coupled massless
scalar field @xmath one finds by taking the trace

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.7.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

the following expression for the Ricci scalar

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.7.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

For the Bondi metric ( 2.3.17 ) this yields

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.7.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

### 3.8 Double Null Equations

To complement the DICE code which is based on Bondi coordinates, we
introduce a first order formulation of the Einstein-scalar field system
in double null coordinates which offers the advantage that it can
penetrate apparent horizons.

We consider the Einstein massless scalar field equations @xmath for the
spherically symmetric metric introduced in section 2.4

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.8.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

in double-null coordinates @xmath . The tensor components are given in
appendix B . We often use shorthands for partial derivatives:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.8.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We set @xmath to simplify the appearance of the matter field terms and
define additional variables in order to write the equations in first
order form following Ref. [ HS96 ] .

First, we define the following evolution variables

  -- -- -------- -------- -- ---------
        @xmath   @xmath      (3.8.3)
        @xmath   @xmath      (3.8.4)
        @xmath   @xmath      (3.8.5)
        @xmath   @xmath      (3.8.6)
        @xmath   @xmath      (3.8.7)
  -- -- -------- -------- -- ---------

The Einstein and matter field equations then become

  -- -- -------- -------- -- ----------
        @xmath   @xmath      (3.8.8)
        @xmath   @xmath      (3.8.9)

        @xmath   @xmath      (3.8.11)
        @xmath   @xmath      (3.8.12)
        @xmath   @xmath      (3.8.13)
  -- -- -------- -------- -- ----------

where we denote Einstein equations of wave-type by the letter E ,
constraint equations by the letter C , and the scalar field wave
equation by the letter S .

Boundary conditions at the center of spherical symmetry are dictated by
regularity and gauge choices as detailed in sections 2.4.2 , 3.8.1 and
3.8.2 and

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.8.14)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.8.15)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.8.16)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.8.17)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

To evolve the coupled first order system, we choose a constrained
evolution using equations E2 , S1 and D2 , D5 , C2 , D4 . This leaves
equations C1 , D1 and D3 for checking the numerical solution.

We need to specify the variables @xmath at the axis, while @xmath and
@xmath are calculated from evolution equations. Obviously, @xmath at the
axis.

#### 3.8.1 Regularity and Boundary Conditions

##### Regular Variables at the Center

We demand that our evolution variables (metric functions, scalar field)
be well defined at the center of spherical symmetry. See [ AG05 ] for a
detailed analysis for Cauchy problems. As we have seen in section 2.3.4
, this is most easily obtained by demanding that the variables must not
have a kink as the origin is crossed along a ray parametrized by linear
distance @xmath . Effectively, this forces all odd derivatives of the
metric with respect to @xmath at constant @xmath to vanish at the
origin. ⁷ ⁷ 7 We may use flat space coordinates @xmath since we impose
local flatness later.

Therefore, @xmath must be an even function of @xmath , i.e.

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.8.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

so that we arrive at the boundary condition

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.8.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Similarly, we have for the scalar field

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.8.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We can also investigate the behavior of @xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.8.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

##### Local Flatness at the Center

As it turns out, one has to also impose local flatness to ensure a
regular behavior in the evolution equations. Again, see [ AG05 ] for
details. Local flatness means that the spatial metric locally looks like
the flat metric

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.8.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In double-null coordinates @xmath the flat spacetime metric is given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.8.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath and @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.8.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

It then follows that @xmath or, in the notation of section 3.8 ),

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.8.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and also that @xmath .

Due to spherical symmetry and local flatness, @xmath has to decrease as
fast (with u) on an ingoing (radial) null ray as it has to increase
(with v) on an outgoing null ray close to the origin. Also, a null ray
through the origin only appears to change direction in spherical
coordinates, while it obviously passes straight through in Cartesian
coordinates.

As we impose local flatness at the center, we may use flat space @xmath
coordinates to express boundary conditions, such as @xmath . It is
straight forward to implement such boundary conditions on an equispaced
double null grid.

Issues of regularity of the evolution equations are discussed in section
3.8.2 .

#### 3.8.2 Regularity of Evolution Equations

At @xmath , the formally singular right hand sides of equations E1 , E2
, and S1 , S2 yield the following conditions:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.8.26)
     @xmath      (3.8.27)
     @xmath      (3.8.28)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The last condition leads to the final boundary condition needed, which
is simply

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.8.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

#### 3.8.3 Diagnostics for the Double-Null System

We calculate the density function @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.8.30)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the Misner-Sharp mass, defined in section 3.7.1 ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.8.31)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The quantity @xmath is used as an indicator for critical behavior and
for the closeness of a slice to the formation of an apparent horizon. To
detect and measure an apparent horizon we search for a zero in the
function @xmath (see 2.4.1 ).

The scalar curvature can be expressed in terms of the scalar field or
the geometry:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.8.32)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The scalar field energy density is given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.8.33)
  -- -------- -- ----------

It is instructive to introduce observers at constant radius @xmath . We
would then like to compute the proper time @xmath along each of these
worldlines of constant @xmath . Following [ HS96 ] we invert @xmath to
obtain @xmath . At @xmath , it follows that @xmath . The line element (
2.4.1 ) then becomes

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.8.34)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Then, we have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.8.35)
  -- -------- -- ----------

At @xmath , local flatness implies @xmath , and thus

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.8.36)
  -- -------- -- ----------

## Chapter 4 Numerical Algorithms

### 4.1 The DICE-code

The compactified code used in [ PHA05 ] is based on the “DICE” (Diamond
Integral Characteristic Evolution) code, which has been documented in [
HLP @xmath 00 ] (there particular emphasis is given to detailed
convergence tests).

#### 4.1.1 Our Overall Computational Scheme

While this section discusses the uncompactified Bondi evolution
algorithm, it can be applied to the compactified system, by a few simple
replacements. Most notably, the metric function @xmath has been replaced
by the Misner-Sharp mass @xmath . See section 3.6 for further details.

##### Summary

We first construct initial data:

1.  Choose the field @xmath on a null slice @xmath .

2.  Also choose the positions, @xmath , of our grid points on this same
    initial slice.

3.  Radially integrate the hypersurface geometry equations ( 3.3.2 )
    and ( 3.3.3 ) outwards from the origin to compute @xmath and @xmath
    at all the grid points on the initial slice.

Our integration scheme starts by first integrating the geodesics back in
time one step @xmath , since our geodesic integrator needs two slices to
work. Now suppose we know all the gravitation and matter fields for time
levels @xmath . To determine them for time level @xmath , we use the
following algorithm (we use the usual notation where superscripts denote
time levels):

1.  Determine the Taylor expansion of @xmath near the origin
    (cf. section 4.1.2 ).

2.  For each grid point in some small (typically 3 grid points) “Taylor
    series region” starting at the origin and working outwards,

    1.  Integrate the geodesic equation ( 4.1.3 ) ahead one time level
        to determine the position of this grid point at time level
        @xmath .

    2.  Using the @xmath Taylor coefficients and the Einstein equations
        (cf. section 4.1.2 ), compute first @xmath , then @xmath and
        @xmath at this grid point

3.  Now for each grid point in the rest of the grid, starting just
    outside the Taylor series region and working outwards,

    1.  Integrate the ingoing null-geodesic equation ( 2.3.28 ) ahead
        one time level to determine the position of this grid point at
        time level @xmath .

    2.  Use the Winicour diamond scheme ( 3.5.2 ) to compute @xmath at
        this grid point.

    3.  Radially integrate the hypersurface geometry equations ( 3.3.2 )
        and ( 3.3.3 ) outwards one spatial grid point to compute @xmath
        and @xmath at this grid point.

##### Discretization of the Evolution System

We evaluate the integral in equation ( 3.5.2 ) by treating the integrand
as constant over the (small) null parallelogram @xmath , as shown in
figure 3.1 . Thus we can compute the integrand at the center of @xmath
which in turn equals its average between the points @xmath and @xmath to
second order accuracy:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath . Then we multiply the integrand by the area of the null
parallelogram @xmath , which can be approximated by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

As will be discussed in section C.3 , this algorithm is globally
2nd order accurate; for the special case of a flat background ( @xmath )
the algorithm is exact.

We use the explicit trapezoidal method (see equation ( C.2.8 ) in
appendix C ) to discretize the hypersurface and ingoing null geodesic
equations. In principle the discretization is straightforward, with the
exception of the null geodesic equation. The corrector requires
evaluating the right hand side at the @xmath time-level, but this has
not been computed yet at the time we do the geodesic integration. To
solve this problem, we radially extrapolate the needed @xmath value from
@xmath and @xmath one spatial gridpoint inwards at the same @xmath
time-level. At the origin, we know @xmath thanks to local flatness,
anyway.

##### Freely Falling Gridpoints

The original Winicour algorithm uses a fixed grid (i.e. the radial
positions of the grid points do not move in the course of evolution. As
the coordinate velocity of light is in general not constant in a curved
space-time, the vertices @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath of the null
parallelogram @xmath cannot be chosen to lie exactly on the grid.
Therefore one has to use interpolation to compute the matter field and
metric functions at the vertices.

In the DICE code we used a different approach (which is, in fact,
borrowed from a different characteristic evolution scheme due to Piran,
Goldwirth and Garfinkle [ Gar95 ] as described in section 3.4 ): Our
gridpoints free-fall along ingoing null geodesics. To compute the
locations of the gridpoints on a new slice we integrate the ingoing null
geodesic equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

With this approach, the vertices of the null parallelogram @xmath in the
diamond algorithm (cf. section 3.5 ) are gridpoints, so we don’t have to
interpolate there.

As well as avoiding interpolation, this scheme has the additional
advantage that it provides a sort of adaptive grid refinement for free,
since, in regions of strong gravity, the null geodesics are being
focussed and thus the density of gridpoints is increased.

Since our grid points move along ingoing null geodesics, each grid point
eventually reaches the origin. At this point it disappears, i.e. we
remove it from the grid.

##### Stability of the Winicour algorithm and adaptive choice of
timesteps

Assuming that the gridpoints follow ingoing null geodesics, we want to
impose a restriction on the “drift” of individual gridpoints from one
slice to the next. It follows from the null geodesic equation ( 4.1.3 )
that, if we want the change in r from a slice @xmath to @xmath to be
smaller than a factor @xmath (’drift_limit’) times @xmath , we have to
demand

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for all gridpoints. (The minus sign in the null geodesic equation is
absorbed by the @xmath which is a directed quantity.) The code assumes
that @xmath , i.e. we drop at most one grid point per time step.

#### 4.1.2 Taylor Expansions

To start off the integration of the evolution system on a new null slice
at retarded time @xmath and time-level @xmath , we Taylor expand the
scalar field on previous slices, and employ the matter field wave
equation to propagate the information to the new slice.

##### Calculation of @xmath

First, we compute a Taylor expansion of the rescaled matter field @xmath
on the slice at @xmath and time-level @xmath in a region that
encompasses the origin of spherical symmetry, @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We have omitted the constant term due to the regularity of the matter
field @xmath and the definition of the rescaled field @xmath . For the
sake of simplicity, we determine the coefficients @xmath and @xmath by
fitting a parabola through two sample points (and the origin). A fancier
approach used in the code is to use a general linear least squares fit
over a number of gridpoints adjacent to the origin, say 5 points. This
way of handling the origin has in practice proven valuable in smoothing
out discontinuities in the fields near the center.

Next, we establish a relation between the field values on the new slice,
at time-level @xmath , and the field on the old slice, at time-level
@xmath . To achieve this we make use of the field equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Solving for the @xmath -term we arrive at

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Replacing the u derivative by a finite difference approximation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

yields

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Using the behavior of @xmath near the origin

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and integrating the above relation, equation ( 4.1.10 ), with respect to
@xmath we recover

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Finally, we insert the Taylor expansion for @xmath into equation (
4.1.12 ) and find the desired result

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath denotes a small quantity (either @xmath or @xmath ).

The calculation works the same way for higher orders. To third-order
accuracy we find

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

##### Calculation of the Metric Functions

We can determine the metric functions on the new slice by inserting the
expansion of the rescaled field, equation ( 4.1.14 ), into the
hypersurface equations

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.1.15)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.1.16)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

We first determine

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and thus

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Along the same lines we have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and eventually

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.1.21)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.1.22)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

The third-order accurate expansions are

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and

  -- -- -- ----------
           (4.1.24)
  -- -- -- ----------

The Ricci Scalar curvature (see section 3.7.4 ) has the following
expansion at the center:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

##### Taylor Series for the Compactified Code

For small @xmath the functional behavior of the x-coordinate is similar
to r, so that we can reuse the Taylor series expansions of the fields as
functions of @xmath as given in section 4.1.2 and transform them to the
@xmath -coordinate by applying the expansion

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

To third order accuracy we obtain ( @xmath denotes a small quantity
@xmath or @xmath )

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.28)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We include one more order for @xmath , since it appears as @xmath in the
field equations.

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and

  -- -- -- ----------
           (4.1.30)
  -- -- -- ----------

#### 4.1.3 Mesh Refinement

Hamadé and Stewart [ HS96 ] have implemented full Berger-Oliger mesh
refinement in double-null coordinates (without compactification) to
achieve sufficient resolution to study critical collapse. Garfinkle [
Gar95 ] has shown, that this is not really necessary – here we follow
his approach to increase resolution: Most importantly, we choose our
gridpoints to follow ingoing radial nullgeodesics. This leads to a rapid
loss of gridpoints in the early phase of collapse, but to an
accumulation of gridpoints in the region of strong curvature for the
late stages of critical collapse (see figure 4.1 ).

Furthermore, when half of the gridpoints have reached the origin we
refine the grid and thus obtain a very simple but effective form of mesh
refinement which is a crucial ingredient in the calculation of critical
collapse spacetimes. In previous work [ HLP @xmath 00 ] we have also
tuned our outermost gridpoint to be located just outside of the past
self-similarity horizon (SSH), the backwards lightcone of the
accumulation point of the self-similar solution. Here we choose to go
out all the way to null infinity. The most effective approach in this
situation would be to just refine the region inside the SSH when half of
the gridpoints in this region have reached the origin. While this is
straightforward to implement, we found the penalty on the resolution
that the original condition (the loss of half of all gridpoints) causes
to be acceptable for the results presented here.

#### 4.1.4 Accuracy and Convergence

The code is globally second order accurate. Figure 4.2 shows a
convergence test for near-critical evolutions.

We want to emphasize that the critical value @xmath of the initial data
parameter depends on the grid resolution. This fact is essential when
doing convergence tests for near critical evolutions, as has been
discussed in our previous paper [ HLP @xmath 00 ] .

To monitor the accuracy of the code during runs we use components of the
Einstein equations which are automatically satisfied if the evolution
equations hold, such as the following linear combination of the @xmath
and @xmath components

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.31)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This can be rewritten in the following form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.32)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath . Since this expression is a linear combination of tensor
components, we use a suitably normalized quantity @xmath , where @xmath
is the sum of the running maxima ( @xmath over a @xmath -slice) of the
absolute values of the individual terms of @xmath . We must have @xmath
for our finite difference solution to be a good approximation to the
continuum solution. A convergence test for this quantity is shown in
figure 4.2 .

We also display numerical convergence tests (see appendix D ) for @xmath
and @xmath (3-level) and @xmath (2-level) in figures 4.3 , 4.4 , and 4.5
which show that our code computes these gridfunctions with the accuracy
expected from the theoretical considerations of appendix C.3 .

### 4.2 The Double-Null Code

The numerical solution scheme for the double-null code follows the work
of Hamadé and Stewart [ HS96 ] and further improvements made by Harada
and Carr [ Har05 ] which makes the scheme second order accurate.

We choose to refer to the evolution equations by the mnemonic
abbreviations Dx , Ex , Cx and Sx , (with x , a number), given in
section 3.8 , rather than usual equation numbers.

#### 4.2.1 Regularization

At the center of spherical symmetry we need to regularize equations E1,
E2, S1 and S2 using l’Hospital’s rule. To simplify matters we use
derivatives @xmath evaluated at @xmath . Derivatives of the type @xmath
are straightforward to write down on an equidistant grid in @xmath and
@xmath . See figure 4.6 for an illustration.

However, we need finite difference approximations for unevenly spaced
grids, as our grid is only evenly spaced in @xmath and @xmath , but not
in @xmath . Such finite difference approximations can be obtained by
determining a low order polynomial through the required number of points
and using symbolic differentiation. This is most easily done in a
computer algebra system, such as Mathematica [ WR05 ] :

For example, a second order accurate approximation of the first
derivative of a function @xmath , given the function values @xmath at
three points @xmath , evaluated at the point @xmath , given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

can be obtained by the compact expression

      rgrid = {r0, r1, r2};
      FullSimplify[NDSolve‘FiniteDifferenceDerivative[ \
      Derivative[1], rgrid, Map[f, rgrid], \
      DifferenceOrder -> 2]][[1]]

Similar expressions can be derived for higher order accuracy and second
derivatives.

Depending on the number of previous slices that we have already
computed, we employ different general finite difference approximations
for these radial derivatives at constant @xmath . As it is not always
possible to use second order accurate approximations, we have to resort
to lower orders in the first two timesteps of an evolution. This is not
a big problem, though, if we stick to initial data of compact support,
such as Gaussian data, where the field initially almost vanishes at the
origin.

To regularize the E2 equation @xmath according to l’Hospital’s rule, we
take the second derivative of the numerator of the singular part of the
right hand side, @xmath , using a second order accurate general finite
difference stencil that requires four points. All other singular
equations require only the computation of first derivatives as the
denominator of the singular right hand sides are @xmath . To regularize
equation S1 we compute an approximation to @xmath using formula ( 4.2.1
), given above.

The right hand side of equation S2 is identical to that of equation S1 ,
so that we can reuse the right hand side approximation computed for S1 .
As it turns out, the right hand side of equation E1 is in fact zero
analytically. This is due to regularity of equation E2 which, in
addition to @xmath , also forces

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

#### 4.2.2 Initial Data

We may freely specify unconstrained data for the scalar field @xmath on
an initial nullcone, usually chosen to lie at @xmath . For the sake of
simplicity, we restrict considerations to Gaussian initial data :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Together with the specification of the gauge for the null coordinate
@xmath , such as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

we can construct initial data for all remaining evolution variables,
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath . ¹ ¹ 1 Note
that Hamadé and Stewart [ HS96 ] fix the gauge by choosing @xmath It is
then trivial to reconstruct @xmath and @xmath by analytic
differentiation and also easy to compute @xmath :

  -- -- -------- -------- -- ---------
        @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.5)
        @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.6)
        @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.7)
  -- -- -------- -------- -- ---------

The remaining quantities @xmath and @xmath have to be reconstructed by
numerical integration:

  -- -- -------- -------- -- ----------
        @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.8)
        @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.9)
        @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.10)
  -- -- -------- -------- -- ----------

We use Simpson’s rule ( C.2.12 ) (and the Trapezoidal rule ( C.2.11 )
for the first gridpoint outwards from the origin) to perform the
integration.

We also apply l’Hospital’s rule for formally singular right-hand sides
at the center as described in section 4.2.1 . Only the equation for p is
formally singular at the origin. Since we do not know any previous
slices, we cannot use @xmath derivatives and instead use @xmath and the
gauge choice ( 4.2.4 ):

  -- -- -- ----------
           (4.2.11)
  -- -- -- ----------

Subscripts of a gridfunction @xmath denote @xmath indices on the
numerical grid, starting at @xmath at the origin. Using this expression
we can derive the following approximation for @xmath by applying the
Trapezoidal rule

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.2.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Similarly, we can derive an expression for @xmath by applying the
Simpson rule

  -- -- -- ----------
           (4.2.13)
  -- -- -- ----------

For indices @xmath we have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.2.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Due to the regularity of equation E2 we have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.2.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Using Trapezoidal and Simpson’s rules we arrive at the following
expressions for @xmath on the initial slice:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.2.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.2.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.2.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

#### 4.2.3 Evolution Scheme

The evolution scheme evolves the massless scalar field coupled to
Einstein’s equations for one time-step. In section 3.8 we have chosen to
use a constrained first order system consisting of the equations E2 , S1
and D2 , D5 , C2 , D4 .

Basically, since the equations to be solved are coupled ODEs, we need to
alternate prediction/ correction steps in the @xmath - and @xmath
-directions. We have implemented the integration of the u-equations via
the explicit Trapezoidal Runge-Kutta method, equation ( C.2.8 ), while
we use the implicit Trapezoidal method, equation ( C.2.7 ), for the
v-equations to render the scheme stable. The set of discretized
equations forms a nonlinear coupled algebraic system where some of the
predicted function values need to be used in the correctors of other
equations. The predicted value for a gridfunction @xmath is denoted by
the hatted quantitiy @xmath .

First, we tackle the boundary conditions at the center of spherical
symmetry @xmath . They can be categorized as follows:

-   algebraic boundary conditions for r, g, and f

-   homogeneous differential boundary conditions for a and s involving
    first derivatives @xmath

-   nonhomogeneous differential boundary conditions for p=q involving
    first derivatives @xmath

Depending on the number of past slices that have already been
calculated, we could discretize the differential boundary conditions in
a number of ways. For first derivatives at the origin we could use the
following stencils:

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.19)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.20)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

It would, however, be wrong to use those approximations, since the grid
will not, in general, be equidistant in @xmath . Therefore we must
resort to more general finite difference formulae as has already been
discussed in section 4.2.1 .

We assume that indefinite expressions (at @xmath ) of the form @xmath
which occur in the right-hand sides of some of the ODE’s have already
been regularized. (Again, see section 4.2.1 .)

The core evolution scheme uses RK2 (explicit Trapezoidal) for the
evolution equations in the @xmath -directions (the @xmath - and @xmath
-equations), and implicit Trapezoidal integration for the @xmath
-equations. Luckily, almost all of the resulting coupled non-linear
algebraic equations in @xmath can trivially be made explicit by solving
them in a fixed order. Only the @xmath - and @xmath -equations need to
be decoupled by solving a linear system (See Ref. [ Har05 ] ).

Effectively, we first calculate predictor values @xmath and @xmath (via
an explicit Euler step) for the @xmath -equations. Then, we proceed to
calculate @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , and finally @xmath and
@xmath , which are already the final values for those quantities. Last,
we correct d and q according to the RK2 explicit trapezoidal step and
set the final values equal to the hatted values for @xmath and @xmath .
We give a detailed description of the algorithm in pseudocode:

###### Evolution Algorithm:

Assuming that the boundary conditions have already been enforced at the
origin gridpoint with index @xmath , we loop over all remaining
gridpoints in a @xmath slice:

#### 4.2.4 Horizon Detection and Excision

To detect apparent horizons we employ a utility function that reliably
finds a possible zero in the gridfunction g[i] that represents @xmath
for a given null slice @xmath . This is accomplished by looking for sign
changes in the discrete gridfunction via a linear search. Such an
algorithm is straightforward to implement and safe to use, as it cannot
overlook zeroes. As we have discussed in section 2.4.1 , due to our use
of an outgoing null foliation and the causal properties of the outer
trapping horizon, the function @xmath can, on a given null slice, at
most have one zero, so that we can safely ignore any further zeroes as
numerical artifacts.

In the code, we compute a quantity             r_AH            defined
as the average of             r[i_left]            and
            r[i_right]            , the interval bracket of the root of
            g[i]            . I.e. the actual zero @xmath is contained
in the interval             [r[i_left],r[i_right]]            .

We illustrate the behavior of the function @xmath by some results from
numerical evolutions. Figure 4.7 shows @xmath for some null slices

Owing to the properties of the outer trapping horizon (see section 2.2
), one might assume that in a numerical collapse evolution using an
outgoing null slicing the first AH is always detected at the outermost
gridpoint of the slice. In practice, this is simply not the case. Due to
the finiteness of the timestep, @xmath , it is highly unlikely to
exactly “hit” the null slice @xmath which coincides with the event
horizon. Instead, one would expect to “jump” over the event horizon and
detect an AH for a @xmath and thus, since @xmath decreases with
increasing @xmath (if the AH is spacelike, which it has to be if matter
falls in), we detect the AH somewhere inside the grid, but not at the
outer grid boundary. On a slice that penetrates the trapping horizon,
all gridpoints for which @xmath are trapped and the slice bends back
towards the curvature singularity at @xmath , i.e. @xmath decreases
until it reaches @xmath for some @xmath . Effectively, this forces us to
cut off a sizeable chunk of the grid on each slice that contains trapped
surfaces: We look for trapped gridpoints, @xmath , that have fallen into
the curvature singularity, that is they fulfill @xmath , and excise them
and all other gridpoints that we deem too close to the singularity. This
is simply done, by setting the outer grid boundary index N to a new
value (smaller than the old one) such that all offending gridpoints are
removed from the grid. In contrast to Cauchy evolution codes, excision
is very natural and straightforward to implement in a double-null code.

#### 4.2.5 Mesh Refinement

Although we closely follow the work of Hamadé and Stewart [ HS96 ] in
our implementation of the double-null code, we employ Garfinkle’s [
Gar95 ] approach to increase resolution which we already described for
the DICE code in section 4.1.3 , rather than the more involved Berger
Oliger type adaptive mesh refinement [ BO84 ] , which was also used in
the seminal work by Choptuik [ d’I92a , Cho93 ] . The application of
Berger Oliger type AMR in a characteristic framework has been discussed
by Pretorius and Lehner [ PL04 ] .

Concerning the mesh refinement strategy, the only difference to the DICE
code, is that the double-null code is uncompactified and we can adjust
the outer boundary of the grid to be slightly larger than the null ray
@xmath which hits the accumulation point at @xmath of the self-similar
solution as described in figure 4.10 . Self-similar solutions and
critical collapse phenomena are discussed in detail in chapter 5 .

#### 4.2.6 Constraints and Convergence

To check that our numerical solution fulfills the Einstein equations we
calculate the constraint C1 :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.2.47)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and suitably normalize it with the absolute value of the running maximum
of its individual terms over a slice, as described in section 4.1.4 . We
also compute the discrete @xmath -norm of the normalized constraint.
Figures 4.11 and 4.12 show the absolute value of the constraint C1 as a
function of @xmath for a couple of null slices in a subcritical and a
supercritical evolution, respectively.

Along with the monitoring of constraint equations, convergence testing
is an important strategy to ensure the correctness of numerical results,
namely that, as the gridspacing tends to zero, the numerical
approximation converges to the analytical evolution system according to
the accuracy of the discretization. The basic methodology is explained
in appendix D .

In the following, we present results from a convergence test using 1001
gridpoints as the base resolution and 2001 and 4001 gridpoints for the
medium and finest resolution, respectively. As the initial data are not
as close to criticality as those used in the convergence test shown in
figure 4.2 for the DICE code, it was not necessary to adjust the initial
data parameter @xmath for each resolution. Due to the size of the
gridspacing and second order accuracy of the code, the finite difference
error is approximately @xmath for the coarsest, @xmath for the medium
and @xmath for the finest resolution. The set of evolutions under
consideration forms an apparent horizon at approximately @xmath with a
mass of @xmath . For details see table 4.1 .

As can be seen from figure 4.13 the AH is well resolved even for the
coarsest resolution of 1001 gridpoints.

A convergence test for the @xmath -norm of the constraint C1 is shown in
figure 4.14 . Interestingly, the first part of the evolution exhibits
fourth order convergence. Later on we have solid second order
convergence. The constraint violations reach @xmath at the formation of
the AH, which is the most demanding part of a collapse evolution, but
otherwise are fine.

In figure 4.15 we show that the scalar field @xmath is second order
convergent.

#### 4.2.7 Timelike Observers

In the following, we describe how to calculate the proper time of an
@xmath observer from the expression ( 3.8.35 ) derived in section 3.8.3
. As the @xmath -values of our gridpoints on the double-null grid keep
changing and we need to integrate over time, we fix a set of
predetermined radii             r[i]            and use interpolation to
obtain the corresponding set of @xmath coordinates for each @xmath
slice. We store the running integrals in a vector
            tp[i]            . The vector is initialized at the initial
slice by setting             tp[i] = r[i]            , since we assume a
flat geometry, initially. On each null slice, and for each observer at
@xmath we

1.  Determine @xmath and @xmath via the relations

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (4.2.48)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    and

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (4.2.49)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    respectively, by using cubic spline interpolation.

2.  Evaluate

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (4.2.50)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    to first order accuracy.

3.  Evaluate @xmath using spline interpolation.

4.  Update the running integral by adding the term @xmath .

If the slice contains an apparent horizon, things are more complicated,
as @xmath is no longer a single-valued function of @xmath . We first
compute the index of the gridpoint with the maximum @xmath -value in the
grid. We can then use spline interpolation in each of the two halves of
the grid, where @xmath is either an increasing (untrapped region) or
decreasing (trapped region) monotonic function of @xmath or gridpoint
index. In the trapped part of a slice @xmath , so we take its absolute
value in ( 3.8.35 ). We now have to keep track of one running integral
for proper time for each half of the slice.

For near-critical evolutions, the trapped part of the slices is very
small and hardly warrants the difficulties incurred. Moreover, due to
excision of gridpoints that come close to the singularity at @xmath , we
are missing data to compute             tp[i]            in the outer
half of the slice.

## Chapter 5 Critical Phenomena

In general relativity, critical phenomena can be subsumed by three
essential features: scaling, self-similarity and universality. They
arise in the behavior of near-critical evolutions, in the course of
which a universal self-similar solution is approached for some time and
the idiosyncrasies of the initial data are mostly “forgotten” and
replaced by symmetries inherited from the attractor. Ultimately, the
self-similar solution causes the evolution to approach an endstate of
the system. While self-similarity can be analyzed in single evolutions,
scaling only becomes apparent when considering the final parameters of a
one-parameter family of evolutions. Dimensionful quantities, such as the
black hole mass, exhibit a power-law behavior with an exponent that is
related to the unstable mode of the self-similar solution.

We first define the special symmetries, discrete and continuous
self-similarity, that lie at the core of critical phenomena. Next, we
give a qualitative description of near-critical evolutions in the
dynamical systems picture. Finally, we derive the scaling law for
dimensionful quantities.

### 5.1 Self-Similarity in General Relativity

First, we introduce the concepts of discrete (DSS) and continuous (CSS)
self-similarity and then go on to talk about coordinates adapted to
these symmetries. Although we are not interested in CSS per se, it is
often much easier to handle and useful for modelling situations where
the periodicity of DSS does not play a decisive role.

A spacetime @xmath is said to be discretely self-similar (DSS) [ Gun99 ]
if it admits a discrete diffeomorphism @xmath which leaves the metric
invariant up to a constant scale factor:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a dimensionless real constant, @xmath and

  -- -- -- ---------
           (5.1.2)
  -- -- -- ---------

is the pullback of the spacetime metric under the diffeomorphism @xmath
and we denote the Jacobian of this map by @xmath .

Similarly, a spacetime that admits a one-parameter family of such
diffeomorphisms, parametrized by @xmath , with @xmath being the
identity, is called continuously self-similar (CSS). The generating
vector field @xmath is homothetic , that is, it obeys the conformal
Killing equation with a constant coefficient on the right hand side:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The choice of the constant is pure convention.

Following Gundlach [ Gun97b ] we introduce coordinates @xmath such that
if a point @xmath has coordinates @xmath , its image @xmath has
coordinates @xmath . One can then verify that DSS in these coordinates
is equivalent to the condition

  ------- -------- -------- -- ---------
          @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.4)
  where                        
          @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.6)
  ------- -------- -------- -- ---------

To explain the connection between CSS and DSS one may introduce a vector
field @xmath . The discrete diffeomorphism @xmath is then realized as
Lie-dragging along @xmath by a distance @xmath . The discrete
diffeomorphism cannot uniquely determine @xmath , as, loosely speaking,
the vector field @xmath is free to do whatever it wants between DSS
“echoing” periods.

We introduce adapted coordinates @xmath based on the Bondi coordinates
defined in section 2.3.2 :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.7)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.8)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a real number which denotes the accumulation time of DSS
and @xmath . A detailed derivation of these adapted coordinates is given
in [ Lec01 ] . We also require that @xmath for all @xmath such that
@xmath for all @xmath . The remaining gauge freedom in @xmath is chosen
such that @xmath (which is timelike at the origin) becomes null at
@xmath . This null hypersurface, the backwards lightcone of the
accumulation point, is known as the past self-similarity horizon (SSH).
See figure 5.1 for a spacetime diagram that illustrates the behavior of
these coordinates.

Next, we transform the Bondi line-element ( 2.3.17 ) to these new
coordinates using the inverse transformation

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.9)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.10)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

which yields

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This line-element fulfills the condition ( 5.1.4 ) if the metric
functions @xmath and @xmath are periodic in @xmath with period @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.12)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.13)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

Which conditions does the symmetry ( 5.1.1 ) imply for the scalar field?
Clearly, matter has to share at least some of the symmetry of the
geometry, as it is coupled via Einstein’s equations. First, we need to
know how the Einstein tensor behaves under the action of the discrete
diffeomorphism. Thanks to general covariance, the pullback of the
Einstein tensor is equal to the Einstein tensor formed from the
pulled-back metric:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

It follows from the definition of DSS, equation ( 5.1.1 ), that @xmath .
Because the structure of the Einstein tensor is such that in every term
that contains the metric, the inverse metric also appears, and since
@xmath we find @xmath and thus

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Via Einstein’s equations this symmetry also holds for the stress energy
tensor:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Taking the pullback of the scalar field stress energy tensor, equation (
3.1.4 ), yields

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where we have used the pushforward of the inverse metric,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and the definition of DSS in terms of the metric, equation ( 5.1.1 ). To
simplify the expression we use the adapted coordinates ( 5.1.7 ) and (
5.1.8 ), so that the point @xmath has coordinates @xmath and @xmath has
coordinates @xmath and drop the angular dependence:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Therefore, we find the condition

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

For the scalar field, the most general ansatz compatible with DSS is
(see Ref. [ Gun97b ] )

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The constant @xmath is determined by the @xmath component of Einstein’s
equations written in terms of the adapted coordinates @xmath . As
discovered numerically by Choptuik, @xmath , for unknown reasons.

The vanishing of @xmath together with the choice of the minus sign in
equation ( 5.1.21 ) for @xmath gives rise to a further symmetry (see [
Gun97b ] , [ Lec01 ] ) that has been numerically observed: If the metric
functions are periodic with a period @xmath and the scalar field is
“anti-periodic” with respect to this period, then, the field is
obviously periodic with respect to the period @xmath . We say that the
solution is DSS with period @xmath and has the additional symmetry

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath denotes the metric functions @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and
the function @xmath , while the scalar field @xmath satisfies

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This is consistent with the fact that @xmath are even in @xmath .

### 5.2 General Relativity as an Infinite Dimensional Dynamical System

Following [ Gun99 ] , we give a brief qualitative introduction to the
dynamical systems picture. We pretend that general relativity can be
treated as an infinite-dimensional dynamical system and ignore
problematic issues such as convergence to an attractor.

We restrict ourselves to isolated self-gravitating systems, such as a
ball of radiation or a star. The phase space consists of the space of
initial data for an isolated ¹ ¹ 1 Note that DSS or CSS do not lie in
this phase space since they are not asymptotically flat. Solutions which
are only self-similar inside a finite radius and asymptotically flat can
be included in the phase space. system, which in our case is just the
space of @xmath . Possible end-states of the system correspond to basins
of attraction in phase space. The boundary between two basins of
attraction is called a critical surface . We restrict attention to the
existence of two distinct endstates; otherwise, more complex critical
points would arise at the intersection of more than two basins of
attraction. Minkowski space is an attractive fixed point in the
dispersion basin, while Schwarzschild black holes form a half-line of
attracting fixed points, parametrized by mass.

Consider an attracting fixed point or limit cycle, the critical solution
, that lies in this critical surface, as shown in figure 5.2 . We assume
that this critical solution, in turn, is an attractor of codimension one
in a neighborhood of phase space, which means that it possesses a single
growing perturbation mode transverse to the critical surface and an
infinite number of decaying modes tangential to the surface. ² ² 2
Attractors which possess more than one unstable mode would be
exceedingly hard to “run into” in the course of numerical evolutions, as
they would require the concurrent fine-tuning to “critical values” of
more than one parameter. Trajectories starting out in the vicinity of
the critical surface at first move close to the surface towards the
critical solution. In the so-called intermediate asymptotics (a term
coined by P. Bizon) they spend some time in the vicinity of the
universal critical solution, shedding all the details of initial data
from which they originated. After a while the growing mode becomes
dominant and the trajectories depart towards the flat space or black
hole fixed point depending on whether the data were sub- or
supercritical, respectively.

In the context of this work the terms “critical solution” and “DSS
solution” (or “self-similar solution”) are often used interchangeably.
Due to self-similarity the DSS solution is evidently not asymptotically
flat. It is however not so clear whether the term critical solution
entails asymptotic flatness or not. Here, we want to make this sloppy
usage more precise: We mean by critical solution an asymptotically flat
spacetime which agrees in a finite region near the centre with the DSS
solution, but falls off at null infinity. E.g. it would be consistent to
have the exact DSS spacetime in the region defined within the backward
light cone of the DSS singularity (the past self similarity horizon) and
outside to fall off smoothly to infinity. Similarly, we call a solution
near-critical, if it comes close to the critical solution (in the above
sense) near the centre of collapse for some time during the evolution.
The spacetime region in which an evolution spends in the neighbourhood
of the critical solution depends on the fine tuning and the class of
initial data. Therefore, the failure of the DSS solution to be
asymptotically flat is perfectly consistent with its role in the
dynamics of a localized object emitting radiation to null infinity.

### 5.3 The Black Hole Mass-Scaling Law

In this section we present an argument for the scaling of the black hole
mass. We follow Gundlach ( [ Gun99 ] , [ Gun97b ] ) and Lechner [ Lec01
] .

For the sake of simplicity, we first consider the spherically symmetric
CSS case. Assume that the self-similar solution is an attractor of
codimension one in phase space, that is, it has exactly one unstable
mode with eigenvalue @xmath . Furthermore, assume that the system has
two possible endstates, dispersion to flat space or black hole
formation, such that the stable manifold of the self-similar solution
divides phase space into subcritical and supercritical data. (See figure
5.2 for an illustration.) Let @xmath denote any scaling variable @xmath
. We use adapted coordinates to CSS:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

General near-critical initial data are attracted via the stable modes of
the CSS solution, which we denote by @xmath . In contrast to a DSS
solution, which would be periodic in the adapted coordinate @xmath , a
CSS solution is independent of @xmath . In the echoing region, where
@xmath dominates we write the solution as a small perturbation of the
CSS solution:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We assume that the single unstable eigenvalue @xmath is real and
positive. As @xmath all other perturbations, which are contained in
@xmath , vanish. The amplitude of the unstable mode @xmath contains
information on the initial data, in particular, the parameter @xmath
that characterizes a one-parameter family of initial data. For so-called
critical initial data , @xmath , the unstable mode is completely tuned
out, so that @xmath . For near-critical data, we may then linearize
around @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

so that for suitable @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Clearly, as @xmath , we see more and more of the critical solution.
Equation ( 5.3.4 ) also sheds light on the universality of the
self-similar solution: The critical phenomena are independent of the
family of initial data.

Let @xmath be a value of the adapted time chosen such that the stable
modes are negligible compared to the unstable mode and that the
amplitude of the unstable mode equals a small number @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Note that @xmath depends on the initial data parameter @xmath . We
rewrite this relation as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the constant is independent of @xmath .

For large @xmath the linear approximation eventually breaks down when
the unstable mode has grown beyond a certain bound. If, as we assume in
the following, the data are supercritical, a black hole forms at late
times. We emphasize that we need not follow the evolution into the
nonlinear regime; it is sufficient to note that intermediate data which
we can extract at @xmath depend on @xmath only through the coordinate
@xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In Bondi coordinates we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The crucial point of this argument is that these intermediate data at
@xmath depend on the initial data, say at time @xmath , only through the
overall scale

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The field equations do not have an intrinsic scale so that in the
absence of an external scale, such as a cosmological constant, the field
equations are invariant under rescalings @xmath , @xmath . Therefore,
the solution based on the data at @xmath must be universal up to the
overall scale.

Because the black hole mass has dimension of length in geometrized units
( @xmath ), it must be proportional to @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and we define the critical exponent

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Relation ( 5.3.10 ) was derived independently by Koike et al. [ KHA95 ]
and Maison [ Mai96 ] .

As pointed out by Garfinkle and Duncan [ GD98 ] , it is also possible to
analyze scaling in subcritical evolutions via the scaling behavior of
the maximum over a whole evolution of the Ricci scalar curvature at the
axis. Due to its dimension being @xmath , the Ricci scalar scales as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Numerically, it is easier to measure the critical exponent from the
subcritical scaling of the Ricci scalar than from the supercritical
scaling of the black hole mass, since one avoids numerical difficulties
incurred in apparent horizon formation.

The mass-scaling relation ( 5.3.10 ) is universal in the sense that it
holds for all one-parameter families of initial data, since its
derivation relies on perturbations of the universal (for each model)
critical solution. Thus, all solutions which approach the attractor for
a while will exhibit this same scaling law.

Although the critical solution itself is not asymptotically flat due to
its self-similarity, one can restrict the analysis to a region of a
sufficiently large, but finite radius, so that the black hole mass is
not affected.

#### 5.3.1 DSS Fine Structure

In the case of a discretely self-similar critical solution, the scaling
law ( 5.3.10 ) is modified by an oscilliatory “fine structure” overlaid
on the linear relation between @xmath and @xmath . This phenomenon was
first predicted by Gundlach [ Gun97b ] and Hod and Piran [ HP97 ] .

Similar to the CSS case, where the perturbation modes of the background
solution would retain its CSS symmetry (independence of @xmath ), the
modes are now periodic in @xmath and equation ( 5.3.2 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Note that @xmath is not periodic in @xmath , whereas the individual
modes @xmath are, since the perturbation must break the DSS symmetry or
the critical solution would not be isolated [ Gun97b ] . Again, for
suitably large @xmath so that the perturbation is still small and we can
neglect the stable modes, we obtain for near-critical data

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As before, we extract intermediate data at a time @xmath defined as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is a small constant. These data depend on @xmath only
through the dimensionless coordinate @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

so that in Bondi coordinates we have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath . The entire solution evolved from these data scales with

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath , @xmath (and @xmath ) are periodic functions of their
argument. Therefore, the black hole mass obeys the following scaling law

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the constant @xmath depends on the family of initial data.
Equivalently,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath and we have introduced the scaling exponent @xmath . As a
function of @xmath , @xmath is periodic with period @xmath (for the
massless scalar field). This is due to the additional symmetry of the
metric functions mentioned in equation ( 5.1.22 ) (see Ref. [ Gun97b ]
).

## Chapter 6 Quasinormal Modes and Tails

### 6.1 Introduction

In general relativity, quasinormal modes (QNM) (see [ KS99 , FN98 ,
Cha83 ] for a review) arise as perturbations of stellar or black hole
spacetimes. Due to energy loss caused by radiation, these infinite
systems do not exhibit normal mode oscillations which are characteristic
of compact linear oscillating systems without damping. Instead, the
frequencies become “quasi-normal”, i.e. complex, with the real part
representing the frequency of the oscillation and the imaginary part
representing the damping. Moreover, in contrast to normal modes,
quasinormal modes do not form a complete set of basis functions.

In addition, for late times, the weak decay of the Schwarzschild
potential causes the quasinormal oscillations to be swamped by the
radiative tail [ Pri72 ] , which only decays polynomially in time.

In the following we give a brief review of the evolution of weak fields
on a Schwarzschild background (or similar) [ NF89 ] . The general
procedure is to expand the field in spherical harmonics (according to
its spin @xmath ). For each radiative multipole @xmath there is a scalar
field @xmath which depends on the Schwarzschild coordinates @xmath and
@xmath . Each such scalar function @xmath satisfies an equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the effective potential and @xmath is the usual
Schwarzschild “tortoise” coordinate, which is related to @xmath by
@xmath .

With the ansatz @xmath we arrive at the following second order ODE that
is similar to the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation for a particle
encountering a potential barrier on the inifinite line [ Iye87 ] :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

For scalar fields the potential is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The effective potential behaves as a potential barrier, as it is
appreciably distinct from zero only in the neighborhood of @xmath (
@xmath ). As @xmath the potential falls off very rapidly.

The so-called quasinormal modes of the black hole are solutions to the
perturbation equation ( 6.1.2 ) which satisfy radiation boundary
conditions for purely outgoing waves at (spatial) infinity and purely
ingoing waves at the horizon. The real part of the QNM represents the
oscillation frequency, while the imaginary part represents the decay.

The radiation produced in response to a perturbation of the field around
a black hole can be divided into three stages:

-   radiation emitted directly by the source of perturbation

-   radiation due to the damped oscillations of quasinormal modes
    excited by the perturbation source (“ringing radiation”)

-   power law tails of radiation, caused by scattering of waves by the
    effective potential

A distant observer first records the radiation from the perturbation
source, then the quasinormal ringing, which decay exponentially, and
finally the radiation tails which decay much slower, by a power law, and
have a very small amplitude in comparison to the first two components.

As an example, the dimensionless frequency @xmath for the @xmath mode of
gravitational perturbations is @xmath , while the @xmath mode for scalar
perturbations is @xmath [ Iye87 ] . Both are fundamental modes.

To convert from the dimensionless frequency @xmath in geometrized units
( @xmath ) to non-geometrized units, we note that the dimension of
@xmath is mass/time which yields the conversion factor @xmath . The QNM
frequency for a 10 solar mass black hole is then

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and the damping time is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

For the @xmath scalar mode, this corresponds to a frequency of @xmath
and a damping time of @xmath , while for the @xmath gravitational mode,
this corresponds to a frequency of @xmath and a damping time of @xmath .
Compared to the Schwarzschild radius for the 10 solar mass black hole,
which is @xmath , the wavelengths of the fundamental QNM are much
bigger, @xmath and @xmath for the @xmath and the @xmath mode,
respectively.

### 6.2 Quasinormal Modes In Critical Collapse

As we have mentioned, QNM excitations are, in general, obtained from
linear perturbations off a fixed background, together with their
associated (complex) eigenvalues. Thus, in a highly dynamical setting,
such as in critical collapse evolutions, one would not expect to see
(identify) quasinormal modes. However, it turns out that for our
setting, the least damped spherically symmetric mode for scalar
perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole plays a relevant role.

Perturbation theory [ Iye87 ] gives the following value for the
half-period

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the real part of the @xmath QNM. This mode has
previously been detected in supercritical evolutions (far away from
criticality) for a self-gravitating massless scalar field by Gundlach et
al. [ GPP94b ] .

In the following, we analyze radiation signals for near-critical
evolutions, where the notion of a fixed background mass does no longer
apply. We find that the monopole moment of the scalar field @xmath shows
a damped oscillation with exponentially increasing frequency (see figure
6.1 ). Moreover, the sizes of the half-periods measured from one
extremum to the next in @xmath roughly agree with the half-periods
obtained from the least damped quasi-normal mode (QNM) of a
Schwarzschild black hole with a strongly changing “background” mass
@xmath as shown in figure 6.2 . @xmath is obtained by evaluating @xmath
at the mean value between the extrema of @xmath (which are inflection
points of @xmath ).

### 6.3 Quasinormal Modes for the Vaidya Metric

#### 6.3.1 The Vaidya Metric

The Vaidya metric [ Poi04 , GS04 , ACS06 ] is a generalization of the
Schwarzschild solution with a changing mass.

We express the Schwarzschild metric in the hybrid outgoing
Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the null coordinate @xmath is defined in terms of the tortoise
coordinate @xmath . Then we allow the mass parameter @xmath to become a
function of retarded time: @xmath . The resulting metric is the outgoing
Vaidya metric

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The only nonvanishing component of the Einstein tensor is @xmath @xmath
. For the metric ( 6.3.2 ) to be a solution of the Einstein equations
the stress-energy tensor must be of the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a radial null vector. This stress-energy tensor
describes null dust , a pressureless fluid with energy density @xmath
moving with a four-velocity @xmath . All the standard energy conditions
[ Poi04 ] are satisfied by @xmath if @xmath . This solution of
Einstein’s equations describes a unidirectional radial flow of
unpolarized radiation in the geometric optics (high frequency)
approximation.

In contrast, the ingoing Vaidya metric is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and @xmath must be a monotonically increasing function of advanced time
@xmath in order to satisfy the energy conditions.

Figure 6.3 shows an imploding shell of massless radiation (modelled by
the ingoing Vaidya solution) which forms a black hole. For a given value
of retarded time, @xmath , let the shell be contained in the interval
@xmath of advanced time, i.e. let @xmath for @xmath and @xmath for
@xmath . Assume that in the interval @xmath the mass-function is chosen
such that no shell focussing singularity appears [ Kur84 ] . ¹ ¹ 1
According to Kuroda [ Kur84 ] , possible choices of mass-function that
do not generate a shell focussing singularity are @xmath , where @xmath
, or @xmath and @xmath . For @xmath observers are unaware of the
infalling shell of radiation. For late times @xmath observers close to
@xmath will experience tidal stresses and will begin to fall inwards. By
that time, they are already trapped in the event horizon. The apparent
horizon of the Vaidya spacetime is always located at @xmath [ Poi04 ] .

#### 6.3.2 QNM Modes in a Vaidya Background

The analysis of QNM for time-dependent situations, such as accretion
processes or Hawking radiation is discussed for the Vaidya metric by
Abdalla, Chirenti, and Saa in [ ACS06 ] . Building on earlier work by
Girotto and Saa [ GS04 ] , they employ a semi-analytical approach in
which one considers the Vaidya metric in double-null coordinates @xmath
ab initio . After choosing a smooth mass-function @xmath , it is
possible to numerically reconstruct the metric functions. Then, scalar
(or electromagnetic) perturbations on the constructed Vaidya background
are evolved using a characteristic algorithm. Analysis of the
perturbation field close to the event horizon then yields estimates for
the real and imaginary parts of the QNM.

The authors point out the existence of a stationary adiabatic regime
where the real part of the QNM varies inversely with the mass-function,
just as one would obtain when modelling the Vaidya solution as a series
of Schwarzschild slices with changing mass as we have done in section
6.2 . In addition, they formulate a heuristic criterion that indicates
when to expect the appearance of non-stationary behavior:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The non-stationary behavior manifests itself as an inertial effect in
the real part of the QNM: @xmath no longer behaves as @xmath , as one
would expect for a stationary adiabatic regime.

In the following, we apply their criterion for non-stationary behavior
to our numerical results. Note that we measure the QNM at @xmath and we
are dealing with a monotonically decreasing function, the Bondi mass
@xmath . ² ² 2 The DICE code from which these results have been
calculated cannot penetrate apparent horizons, and, at least for
critical collapse, we have not been able to read off QNM close to the
event horizon. In section 6.2 we have observed that the real parts of
the fundamental scalar field QNM roughly agrees with its Schwarzschild
value (for a decreasing mass) during critical collapse. We have verified
this (see figures 6.1 , 6.2 ) by comparing the half-periods measured
from one extremum to the next in @xmath with the half-periods predicted
by perturbation theory with a strongly changing background mass @xmath .

We have also tried to read off the imaginary parts of the QNM from
@xmath , but to no avail: One the one hand, this is very difficult,
because we do not have many oscillations to accurately measure the
decay. But, more importantly, as shown in figure 6.4 , @xmath behaves as
@xmath . This is due to self-similarity, since the monopole moment
@xmath has dimension of length. We note that we have corrected a slight
offset in @xmath .

Instead of directly reading off the imaginary part of the QNM, we can
still estimate the decay from perturbation theory for a few background
masses and compare the result to @xmath in order to check that the
non-stationarity criterion mentioned above, ( 6.3.5 ) is not fulfilled.
As can be seen in the figures 6.5 and 6.6 , stationarity is well
satisfied with the exception of the very late stages of collapse, where
we leave the self-similar regime and approach black hole formation.

### 6.4 Power-law Tails

As has been established by Price [ Pri72 ] , perturbation fields outside
of Schwarzschild black holes die off with an inverse power-law tail at
late times. In contrast to quasinormal modes this behavior does not
depend on the details of the collapse process, but only on the
asymptotic falloff of the effective potential; (i.e. in a curved
spacetime, wave propagation is not confined to the light cones, rather
waves spread inside the light cones, due to scattering off spacetime
curvature.) Therefore, tail phenomena can be observed independently of
the endstate of the evolution. For Gaussian initial data the
Newman-Penrose constant [ GWS94 ] vanishes and for late times
perturbation theory [ GPP94a , GPP94b ] predicts that the field falls
off as @xmath near @xmath and @xmath near timelike infinity @xmath .

To be more precise [ Bar99a , Bar99b ] , consider a distant static
observer at @xmath and Bondi time @xmath elapsed since the “main pulse”
of radiation has reached the observer (the duration of the main pulse
has been assumed negligible in [ Bar99a , Bar99b ] ). Null infinity is
then found to be approximated by the region where @xmath within the
context of a perturbative analysis of tail behavior [ Lea86a , Lea86b ,
Bar99a ] . This regime has been termed the “astrophysical zone” by
Leaver [ Lea86a , Lea86b , Bar99a ] .

In addition, the convergence of the perturbation expansion in [ Bar99a ,
Bar99b ] requires @xmath , where @xmath is the mass of the background.
In our case, the mass which gives rise to the effective potential is
bounded from above by the mass of the initial (ingoing) pulse, @xmath .
Therefore, we demand that @xmath . Numerically, we observe tails only
for @xmath .

Closeness to timelike infinity, on the other hand, demands @xmath ,
where @xmath is the usual “tortoise” coordinate @xmath . In figure 6.7
we show power-law exponents determined by fits of @xmath at different
@xmath curves over a series of time intervals for a subcritical
evolution. As described in section 4.1 we use spline interpolation to
calculate @xmath . The exponents have been determined by fitting the
field @xmath at @xmath against a power of @xmath in 5 distinct time
intervals of the evolution. The domains of validity of the exponents
predicted by perturbation theory, @xmath near @xmath and @xmath near
@xmath , can be observed here. It is clear that the outermost gridpoints
in this evolution (using 10000 gridpoints) are indeed located in the
“astrophysical zone” since @xmath , where @xmath is the Bondi time
elapsed since the main pulse of radiation has reached the observer at
about @xmath (see figure 6.8 ). On the other hand, closeness to timelike
infinity @xmath demands that @xmath . Note that @xmath for @xmath ,
where @xmath is the initial Bondi mass. It is also apparent that for
@xmath the observers are in between the two zones and the power-law
exponents seem to change smoothly.

Figure 6.8 displays the power-law decay, with exponent @xmath , of the
Bondi mass for the same subcritical evolution. This behavior can be
explained by integrating the Bondi mass-loss equation ( 3.7.13 ) with
@xmath in the regime of power-law tails.

Note that in situations involving realistic sources and realistic
detectors, power-law tails only play a minor (if any) role as an actual
signal, but the power-law tail results still can provide hints on how to
resolve the very important question of whether null infinity is a useful
idealisation for gravitational wave detectors. Accordingly, we suggest
to generalize the term “astrophysical zone” to more general,
non-perturbative situations, by re-enterpreting – in a very loose sense
– @xmath as a suitably chosen large time scale characteristic of the
source. The physical idea is that the distance from observers of
astrophysical phenomena, e.g. gravitational wave detectors, to the
radiation sources is very large compared to the time during which
substantial radiation from the source can be observed. This is at least
expected for sources where general relativity is important, as opposed
to problems for which a (Post-) Newtonian approach and the quadrupole
formula are sufficient. An example would be a binary black hole merger
in another galaxy, which might have a characteristic dynamical time
scale of a fraction of a second, and which might be observed during
several thousand cycles, including a portion of the QNM ringdown.

## Chapter 7 Numerical Evidence for Critical Phenomena

In this chapter we present numerical results of critical behavior in the
Einstein-massless scalar field system computed using the DICE code and
the double-null code.

Section 7.1 focusses on results from the compactified dice evolution
code which stress the global observability of critical phenomena at
future null infinity. We also show results from uncompactified
evolutions for cases in which we did not have compactified results
available. We would like to emphasize that for the local detection of
discrete self-similarity, inside the past self-similarity horizon, as
discussed in section 7.1.3 , both DICE codes are basically equivalent,
the uncompactified DICE code having a slight edge over the compactified
code as to resolution.

The results of the double-null code shown in section 7.2 complement the
local picture given by the DICE code. The double-null code is
uncompactified but, in contrast to the DICE code, it can penetrate
apparent horizons and thus enables us to probe supercritical spacetimes
a little longer. The reason for introducing this code was mostly to
analyze the fate of the exterior mass that accumulates outside of the
past self-similarity horizon in near-critical evolutions, as will be
discussed in section 7.1.2 . Moreover, it is always preferable to have
more than one way of computing a numerical result, which, by comparison,
allows us to rule out numerical artifacts specific to a particular
numerical scheme.

### 7.1 Results from the DICE Code

#### 7.1.1 Identification of Critical Behavior

We consider one-parameter families of initial data @xmath , such that
for small values of @xmath we have dispersion, while for large values of
@xmath we have black hole formation. It has been found numerically [
d’I92a , Cho93 ] that, for any initial data family considered, the
evolution of near-critical data approach a universal DSS critical
solution. In this thesis, we assume universality and restrict ourselves
to Gaussian-like initial data

  -- -- -- ---------
           (7.1.1)
  -- -- -- ---------

where @xmath . This choice makes it easy to compare compactified to
uncompactified evolutions using the same initial data. All results from
the compactified DICE code presented here use @xmath and @xmath and a
radial resolution of @xmath gridpoints, unless stated otherwise. The
criticality parameter @xmath is identified with the amplitude @xmath .

As has become common practice, we find near-critical data through a
bisection search in @xmath . This procedure yields in particular a
numerical approximation to the critical value @xmath which defines the
threshold of singularity formation.

In the bisection search, a number of criteria are possible to
distinguish dispersion from collapse. Their equivalence can be checked a
posteriori when comparing the final result, i.e. subcritical and
supercritical solutions close to criticality. A typical criterion is to
monitor the ratio @xmath , where @xmath signifies the presence of an
apparent horizon. This criterion has been used successfully also in
combination with slicing conditions, that do not penetrate apparent
horizons – as is the case in our approach. Remarkably, in practice it
turns out, that @xmath is a sufficient criterion to mark a scalar field
evolution as supercritical. For practical and historical reasons, this
is the approach we have adopted for our code.

A number of other options come to mind, in particular in our context of
evolving out to null infinity, one could e.g. monitor the redshift (
2.3.46 ) or Bondi mass. In a dispersion evolution, the redshift will
decay to zero, while it will approach infinity when a black hole forms.
Similarly, the Bondi mass will decay to zero with a characteristic tail
behavior, as is shown in Fig. 6.8 , in a dispersion evolution, and will
asymptote to a (positive) constant when the field does not disperse.

The local detection of discrete self-similarity and extraction of the
critical echoing parameter @xmath from a near-critical numerical
evolution is discussed in section 7.1.3 . Here we are concerned with the
global picture: In the course of a near-critical evolution, remnants of
the self-similar dynamics which occur locally, inside the SSH, are
radiated to future null infinity. Remarkably, we observe that the
imprints of DSS behavior are still present in asymptotic quantities such
as the news function and the Bondi mass (see figures 7.1 and 7.8 ).

To further test the accuracy of the compactified DICE code in the
asymptotic regime, we have plotted the left and right hand sides of the
Bondi mass-loss equation, ( 3.7.12 ), in figure 7.2 . Figure 7.3 shows
the redshift factor, equation ( 2.3.46 ), for the same evolution.

In addition, in numerical evolutions of supercritical data, the black
hole mass has been found to exhibit a universal scaling law ( 5.3.20 ),
in accordance with the discussion in section 5.3 , (see [ HP97 , KHA95 ,
Gun97b ] ):

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath and the function @xmath is periodic with period @xmath in
@xmath . Figure 7.5 shows this scaling behavior of the mass. To analyze
the fine-structure of the mass-scaling law, one conveniently runs a
series of evolutions with masses spaced linearly in @xmath . One also
needs to ensure to measure the mass of the outermost component of the
horizon in order to obtain the fine-structure of the scaling law shown
in figure 7.4 .

This scaling law has been derived by arguments based on linear
perturbation theory around the critical solution and dimensional
analysis however without using a precise definition of the black hole
mass [ HP97 , Gun97b ] . A typical approach in numerical simulations
based on coordinates that do not penetrate apparent horizons, as far as
we are aware, is to follow a peak in @xmath until this quantity almost
reaches unity, at which point the simulation is usually slowed down by a
CFL-type condition, and then read off the approximate horizon mass at
this point. We follow this heuristic approach, and are able to reproduce
the mass scaling and fine structure.

At least conceptually, this approach is problematic without quantifying
how much mass-energy still remains outside of the peak in @xmath where
the horizon-mass is read off. From the perturbation theory argument, one
expects scaling behavior only for quantities within the self-similar
region of spacetime, which does not necessarily extend beyond the SSH.
We will return to this point in the discussion section 8 .

We have found that the mass scaling law for compactified evolutions
exhibits a ”leveling-off” effect for strongly fine-tuned evolutions.
Figure 7.6 shows that for @xmath the logarithm of the detected black
hole mass is constant, while further away from criticality, the scaling
agrees with the expected power law behavior given in equation ( 5.3.20
). The fact that this constant is resolution dependent, i.e. it
decreases with increasing resolution, indicates that it is a numerical
artifact of the compactified code.

In contrast, uncompactified evolutions generated by the DICE code where
the outer grid boundary has been adjusted to be close to the ingoing
null ray, @xmath , that hits the accumulation point, are completely
unaffected by this leveling off in the scaling law (see figure 7.5 ).
Nor are codes affected that penetrate the apparent horizon and base
their horizon detection on the first actual apparent horizon detected on
a slice, such as our double null code (see figure 7.18 in section 7.2.1
).

Note that for a near-critical solution, the approximate value of the
accumulation time naturally defines an approximate location (i.e.
advanced time) of the SSH.

For observers at null infinity, a natural time coordinate is Bondi time
@xmath as defined in eq. ( 2.3.35 ) – Bondi time can be identified with
the proper time of timelike observers at large distances – see the
discussion in Sec. 8 . In order to analyze critical phenomena, we define
a time coordinate which is suitably adapted to self-similar critical
collapse and set

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The adapted time coordinate @xmath can be defined for spacetimes which
are close to the critical solution inside of the SSH, so that the value
of the accumulation time @xmath can be determined by a fit to
periodicity in @xmath . We have used a fit to periodicity of the news
function – @xmath is periodic with period @xmath after the spacetime has
come close to the critical solution (see figure 7.1 ).

Note that @xmath is only an approximate adapted coordinate since it
depends on the relation between Bondi and central time ( 2.3.35 ). In
order to gain some insight into the behavior of @xmath consider the
simpler case of a CSS collapse. We assume that @xmath changes only
little outside the past SSH, i.e. @xmath . Then, since @xmath in the CSS
regime, we find by integrating ( 2.3.35 ) that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath and we have chosen the initial condition @xmath .
Furthermore, it follows from the definition of the adapted time
coordinates, equations ( 5.1.7 ) and ( 7.1.3 ), that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

in the CSS regime. Numerically, the deviations from this relation for
the DSS case turn out to be quite small. We cannot expect this relation
to hold, if the mass outside the past SSH is large compared to the
inside, which we observe in the very late stages of strongly fine-tuned
evolutions. Nevertheless, we have still been able to resolve DSS
phenomena using the coordinate @xmath (see fig. 7.8 ).

#### 7.1.2 DSS Behavior in the Bondi Mass and the News Function

The following argument suggests that the news function is approximately
periodic in @xmath , as shown in figure 7.1 . Assume effective DSS data
for the scalar field and the metric functions on the past
self-similarity horizon (SSH) (see figure 7.7 ). Moreover, we assume
that the contribution of the right hand side integral in the wave
equation for the scalar field ( 3.5.1 ) can be neglected outside of the
SSH, such that the DSS data on the SSH are linearly propagated to @xmath
without backscattering, i.e.

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Furthermore, assume that changes in @xmath outside of the SSH are small,
so that @xmath . It then follows that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which shows that the news function @xmath is approximately periodic in
@xmath (and in @xmath if equation ( 7.1.5 ) holds) with period @xmath
and satisfies @xmath .

In order to determine the behavior of the Bondi mass, we can then
rewrite the Bondi mass-loss equation ( 3.7.13 )

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Since @xmath is @xmath -periodic in @xmath , @xmath then takes the
following form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is @xmath -periodic in @xmath .

This behavior mimics the behavior of the mass-function: We rewrite the
mass-function in adapted coordinates @xmath , using ( 5.1.8 ),

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.1.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and evaluate it at the SSH, which, by a judicious choice of the periodic
function @xmath can be chosen to be at @xmath (since the past SSH is a
null surface, one needs to ensure that @xmath becomes null at @xmath ).
We obtain

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.1.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is periodic with period @xmath .

The periodicity and exponential decay of @xmath and @xmath are confirmed
by our numerical calculations (see fig. 7.8 ). Note that the Bondi mass
levels off at roughly @xmath of the mass in the initial configuration,
whereas the mass contained within the backwards light cone @xmath
continues to scale according to the prediction of critical collapse
evolution, equation ( 7.1.9 ). Since the difference, i.e. @xmath , is
almost zero at the initial slice, we conjecture that, at late times,
@xmath is the energy due to backscattering in a critical evolution. We
do not have a physical explanation for the oscillations seen in @xmath
for earlier times. This behavior may, however, be due to errors in the
determination of the location of the past SSH. In figure 7.9 it is
apparent that @xmath is localized in a region outside the past SSH.

We observe that @xmath contained in a slice close to horizon formation
is almost constant for different near critical evolutions (down to the
numerical limit of fine tuning). In the very late stages of the
evolution, the growing redshift, @xmath effectively halts the numerical
evolution, while the error norm @xmath approaches @xmath .

#### 7.1.3 Local Detection of Discrete Self-Similarity

We discuss some methods to extract the echoing exponent of discrete
self-similarity from a near-critical numerical evolution while
restricting attention to the past self-similarity horizon.

##### max(2m/r)-Plots

The black-hole formation diagnostic @xmath furnishes a necessary
condition for discrete self-similarity, namely periodicity in the
function

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.1.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the maximum is taken over @xmath null slices and @xmath denotes
the mass-function in spherical symmetry, as defined in equation ( 3.7.1
).

The viability of this approach depends on the choice of initial data.
For the usual Gaussian initial data family, experience shows that the
maximum is well-defined. For other choices, such as the double-Gaussian
initial data of section 7.2.4 , two (or more) peaks in @xmath may
compete with each other and thus the maximum can jump from one slice to
another.

The echoing exponent @xmath can be determined by analyzing plots of
@xmath vs. @xmath and adjusting @xmath such that successive echoes obey
a constant spacing, which equals @xmath . In practice, a crude estimate
of @xmath can be obtained in slightly supercritical evolutions as the
coordinate time of the formation of the (small) black hole. This process
can be carried out by hand or automatized by a fitting procedure. The
initial transient in which the system first approaches the vicinity of
the attractor has to be ignored. The result of such a fit is shown in
figure 7.11 .

##### DSS-Snapshots

Although plots of the diagnostic @xmath are handy for determining @xmath
and @xmath , since they are easy to generate, they do not encompass the
full scope of DSS, since, by taking the maximum, the information
available is collapsed down to just one data point per null-slice. Given
a function on spacetime which is DSS, it shows this behavior at any
given radial position. This much stronger criterion can be investigated
with the following method (adapted from [ Cho98 ] ).

In coordinates @xmath DSS corresponds to a logarithmic rescaling in both
time and space. As has been discussed in section 5.1 , in adapted
coordinates @xmath DSS amounts to

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.1.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Here, we prefer to use @xmath instead of @xmath . From the definition of
@xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.1.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

observe that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.1.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Thus, the following equality holds

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.1.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and, for a given @xmath , and using @xmath , we have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.1.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Successive frames in the plots shown in figures 7.12 and 7.13 are
equally spaced in the adapted time coordinate @xmath . The quantities
are plotted against @xmath with appropriate “shifts” in the null slices
according to equation ( 7.1.17 ).

While dimensionless quantities ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ) are
mapped according to ( 7.1.17 ) without a change of scale under the
diffeomorphism associated with DSS, dimensionful quantities such as
@xmath or @xmath also scale according to their dimensions, e.g. @xmath
and thus

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.1.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As an example, figure 7.14 shows the scalar field and its image under
the DSS diffeomorphism.

To be able to more clearly visualize discrete self-similarity, we show
the scalar field as a function of @xmath and @xmath for a near-critical
compactified evolution in figures 7.15 and 7.16 . Figure 7.17 depicts
the ingoing null geodesic that hits the accumulation point of the
DSS-solution.

### 7.2 Results from the Double-Null Code

The results shown here are based on fine-tuning of Gaussian initial data

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In section 7.2.4 we introduce double Gaussian data that are merely a
superposition of two such Gaussians with parameters adjustable for each
pulse.

#### 7.2.1 Scaling

To complement the results from the DICE code, figures 7.18 and 7.19 show
the expected scaling behavior for the black hole mass and the Ricci
scalar curvature from a one-parameter family of evolutions generated by
the double null code, respectively. According to its dimension being
@xmath , the scalar curvature scales as @xmath , as discussed in section
5.3 .

#### 7.2.2 Horizons and @xmath

In section 7.1.2 we mentioned that exterior matter, @xmath , accumulates
outside the past self-similarity horizon and we conjectured that, for
late times, the mass originates from backscattering of outgoing
radiation during the self-similar collapse. In a supercritical
evolution, two scenarios are possible: Either @xmath eventually falls
through the horizon, or it is radiated to infinity. In the former case,
the resulting black hole will have a tiny but finite Bondi mass, no
matter how fine tuned the data are, whereas, in the latter case, the
Bondi mass can be made arbitrarily small.

We would like to explicitly verify whether this matter, @xmath , falls
through the event horizon. (A compactified code that could penetrate
apparent horizons would presumably still have to stop at the event
horizon, due to reaching future timelike infinity, @xmath . Using an
uncompactified code, we will have to settle for a reasonable local
approximation of the event horizon.)

At first, it would seem that one could investigate the final fate of
@xmath with any evolution code that can penetrate apparent horizons,
such as the double null code of section 4.2 . As it turns out, however,
codes based on outgoing null slices are ill-suited to tackle this issue.

Only the immediate vicinity of the event horizon is relevant for the
solution of this problem. Null slices too far to the future of the event
horizon no longer contain @xmath , since the slices will have “bent”
towards the curvature singularity at @xmath , and trapped gridpoints
which come too close to the singularity will have been excised, as has
been discussed in section 4.2.4 . This leaves us with a slice where the
very features we would like to study, namely the exterior matter, have
probably already fallen into the singularity.

To illustrate the behavior of the mass function on outgoing null slices
in the vicinity of apparent horizon formation we compare a series of
slices for a near-critical evolution using 5000 gridpoints in figure
7.20 . If a slice contains an apparent horizon, the function @xmath
increases monotonically from the origin outwards until the locus of the
AH is reached; there, it reverses direction and decreases monotonically
until it reaches the singularity at @xmath . Gridpoints which come too
close to the singularity must be excised. In contrast, figure 7.21
depicts a series of slices for a near-critical evolution which
ultimately is subcritical. The two plots are superimposed in figure 7.22
.

To improve the chance to observe the exterior mass falling into the
horizon, it is clearly beneficial to decrease the timestep @xmath as far
as possible. Unfortunately, the double null code relies on the condition
@xmath for the approximation of derivatives close to the origin. We have
tried to use interpolation to get rid of this condition, but our efforts
introduced instabilities that made evolutions unusable. There is, in
principle, another way. Namely, keep the condition @xmath and increase
the overall spacetime resolution, i.e. both gridspacings. The result of
such a brute force evolution using @xmath gridpoints is shown in figure
7.23 . The horizon mass is almost two orders of magnitude lower, but the
bending-over of the slices is still much too abrupt and all the exterior
mass has been excised on the first slice which contains an apparent
horizon in this evolution.

The behaviour discussed above is a deficiency intrinsic to our choice of
slicing: Null-slices are inherently unstable near a horizon. Outgoing
null-slices either extend till @xmath , if they are untrapped, or end at
the singularity @xmath (with the exception of the event horizon which
extends till @xmath ). Thus, it would be seem to be appropriate to use a
Cauchy code to investigate this issue further. This would allow us to
scan the horizon for exterior infalling matter.

#### 7.2.3 Dependency of @xmath on Initial Data

In the following, we would like to discuss the dependance of the
exterior matter, @xmath , on the initial data. First, choose a family of
initial data and fix all free parameters except for the parameter @xmath
that will be used for fine-tuning. Within such a family, as we tune the
parameter @xmath to criticality, we can reliably measure @xmath only if
at some null slice in a given evolution, the interior mass is of the
same order or smaller than @xmath or the interior and exterior mass are
spatially well separated. In practise, this condition is only fulfilled
at late times for very near-critical evolutions which severely restricts
the interval in the initial data parameter and evolution time over which
we can accurately measure the exterior mass @xmath .

From the analysis of a typical single near-critical (but supercritical)
evolution, @xmath oscillates from the time we can first detect it until
the last null slice before horizon formation, while the interior mass
(contained in the past SSH) undergoes critical collapse and periodically
sheds mass. If we instead consider a family of supercritical evolutions
which become more and more near-critical, and measure @xmath at the last
slice before horizon formation, @xmath roughly stays constant.

It is also important to note that, using generic (e.g. Gaussian) initial
data, which have been fine-tuned, the solution evolves through a
non-universal and family dependent stage before it approaches the
self-similar regime. Since backscattering of radiation is already
present in this initial stage, we expect @xmath to also depend on the
shape or family of initial data used.

#### 7.2.4 Double Gaussian Initial Data Results

In an effort to shed some light on the issue concerning the possible
infall of the external mass @xmath , we have devised initial data to
model this physical situation. Essentially, we are dealing with a
near-critical evolution where the interior part is in the DSS regime
(for a certain time) while further outside, there is another
concentration of energy. Therefore, it is sensible to chose initial data
which consists of two Gaussian pulses of scalar field, which we call
double Gaussian initial data for short.

As it turns out, @xmath is not dense enough to form an apparent horizon
by itself. This can be guessed from the fact that there is no apparent
peak in @xmath at the locus of @xmath . It is also possible to evolve
data that are based on the numerical scalar field solution on a null
slice of a near-critical evolution where the presence of @xmath is the
dominating contribution of mass. Using such a solution, @xmath ,
(preferably the last available slice before the formation of an AH) as
new initial data @xmath is fairly straightforward. In is necessary to
employ interpolation to obtain equally spaced initial data @xmath for
the scalar field . Here, we have also had to fix the null gauge, which
determines how the gridpoints are labeled by @xmath and @xmath . If
necessary, taper the gridfunction such that the gradients in the
interior part are smooth enough that they do not form trapped surfaces;
in practise, this is taken care of automatically by the interpolation.
We have carried out this procedure and found that the new spacetime is
subcritical.

The accumulation of exterior mass that occurs naturally via
backscattering in critical collapse could be modeled by data where the
outer pulse is chosen weak enough so that it does not collapse by
itself. Unfortunately, simulations of that type did not yield any new
insights, since we still run into the problem of the bending-over of
slices and forced excision of the part of the slice we would like to
follow further.

Although not directly related to the issue we would like to solve, we
have investigated spacetimes where the outer pulse can form a horizon,
while the interior pulse evolves, more or less unaffected from the outer
pulse, as they are interesting in their own right. In particular, we
consider a configuration where the outer pulse froms an AH first (in
retarded time @xmath ), while we can still follow the interior pulse in
its critical collapse. Later (in retarded time), the interior pulse may
itself form trapped surfaces, which creates a jump in the trapping
horizon. A spacetime diagram of such an evolution is shown in figure
7.24 . Figure 7.25 presents a density plot of @xmath for this evolution,
(with a detail shown in figure 7.26 ), while figure 7.27 shows a
perspective view.

#### 7.2.5 Timelike Observers and @xmath versus @xmath Diagrams

For timelike observers at @xmath we can compute the proper time @xmath
as discussed in sections 3.8.3 and 4.2.7 . In doing so, we obtain a
@xmath grid on which we can display quantities of interest, such as the
density function @xmath . Since this grid is neither orthogonal, nor
equispaced, we need to resort to interpolation for some plots.

In order to have more resolution in the vicinity of the origin, one can
use a static mapping in the distribution of the @xmath observers. A
useful convex mapping is to equally space the observers in a
computational coordinate @xmath and define @xmath with @xmath , so that
@xmath . Figure 7.28 shows a color-coded density plot of @xmath on such
a grid, where the null slices @xmath have been overlaid. Grid
refinements are clearly visible when the density of the slices suddenly
doubles. The geometry is initially flat. The evolution uses double
Gaussian initial data, where the exterior pulse forms the first (in
retarded time @xmath ) apparent horizon and the interior collapses at a
later null slice after moving away from the DSS regime.

In contrast, figure 7.29 compares the fate of @xmath observers in a
supercritical and a subcritical evolution.

## Chapter 8 Discussion

In this thesis we have presented numerical constructions of portions of
near-critical spherically symmetric spacetimes that extend up to future
null infinity. The simulations are based on a compactified approach,
where the equations have been regularized in a neighborhood of null
infinity by introducing the mass-function as an additional independent
variable. Further simulations have been carried out using a double-null
code that can penetrate apparent horizons. In this discussion, however,
we focus on key results obtained from the compactified code as they
represent the new developments in this thesis. The resolution necessary
to resolve critical phenomena is gained through letting our gridpoints
fall along ingoing null geodesics, following Garfinkle [ Gar95 ] . The
grid is repopulated with grid points, which are filled with values
through interpolations when half of the gridpoints have reached the
origin. This is not optimal, but ensures sufficient resolution for our
current purposes.

We reproduce standard features of near-critical solutions, such as
“echoing” and mass scaling with fine structure. The mass scaling law for
compactified evolutions shows a “leveling-off” effect for very
near-critical solutions that is not present for uncompactified
simulations which we attribute to numerical errors. In addition, we
extract radiation at null infinity by computing the news function and
find a signal with rapidly increasing frequency as measured in Bondi
time, which is the natural time coordinate associated with far away
observers. In order to simplify the analysis of near-critical
spacetimes, we have defined an approximate adapted time in terms of
Bondi time, in analogy to the standard time coordinate which is adapted
to the DSS discrete diffeomorphism ( 5.1.1 ). This coordinate can be
used by asymptotic observers to render the signal from a near-critical
collapse (almost) periodic. The fact that such a definition actually
works out, and makes DSS periodicity manifest in quantities defined at
null infinity is a non-trivial result, which we explain in Sec. 7.1.1 .

Note also that the amplitude of the news function, shown in Fig. 7.1
stays fairly constant after the initial transient. This feature is
clearly universal, as long as the radiation signal is dominated by the
DSS collapse, since the system can be approximated in the DSS region by
a perturbation of the critical solution. Thus, in section 7.1.2 , we
neglect contributions from scalar field which is far outside the DSS
region and does not contribute to the critical collapse dynamics.
Consequently, in this scenario the essential free parameters determining
the radiation signal from an actual near critical solution are the
number of cycles the solution spends in the neighborhood of the critical
solution and the length scale (e.g. the “size” of the past SSH) at which
the solution comes close to the critical solution. The robustness of
this scenario, i.e. what happens if the initial data are such that there
is significant mass outside of the SSH, is beyond the scope of this
thesis and an issue for future research.

Perhaps the most surprising feature of the radiation signal has emerged
from our investigation of QNMs, which has been motivated by [ GPP94b ] ,
where the first quasinormal mode is found in collapse evolutions and the
question is posed as to how QN ringing would change close to
criticality. We find that even in very close-to-critical evolutions
there is a correlation of the radiation signal with the period of the
first quasinormal mode, determined from the time-dependent value of the
Bondi mass, as discussed in Sec. 6.2 , Figs. 6.1 and 6.2 . This
correlation between the radiation of the highly dynamical near-critical
solution and the quasinormal mode, that is defined in terms of
perturbations of a static spacetime, certainly deserves further
investigation. This surprising feature might even turn out to be a key
toward understanding the phenomenon of DSS behaviour in near-critical
spacetimes. Our results seem to suggest that the effective curvature
potential for a DSS self-gravitating field acts as a quasi-stationary
background for scattering processes which can be approximately described
by quasinormal modes of a one-parameter family of Schwarzschild black
holes with exponentially decreasing mass.

This Schwarzschild background with decreasing mass can also be modeled
by the Vaidya solution as discussed in section 6.3 . Abdalla, Chirenti,
and Saa [ ACS06 ] have computed QNM for the Vaidya metric and have put
forth a criterion to analyze whether a spacetime is in the “stationary
adiabatic regime” where the real part of the QNM varies inversely with
the mass function. We have been able to verify that our critical
collapse evolutions are indeed in this stationary regime.

The question of the applicability of QNM-motivated estimates is quite
relevant for numerical relativity, e.g. when extracting wave forms from
binary mergers.

For subcritical initial data we can evolve for very long times, and thus
are able to observe power-law tail behavior as shown in Figs. 6.7 and
6.8 . Analytical calculations predict different falloff rates for
radiation along null infinity and along timelike lines, and the natural
question arises, which falloff rate would be seen by a hypothetical
observer (in a realistic case, observation of power-law tails would
require an extremely large signal-to-noise ratio). Accordingly, our
results depicted in Fig. 6.7 show how the rates at finite but large
radius correspond to the value for null infinity for a while before they
approach the expected late-time value for finite radius. The
interpretation of this phenomenon is suggested by perturbative work of [
Bar99a , Bar99b ] , where different tail falloff rates are computed.
There, different regions of spacetime are identified, where certain
approximations hold. Within the perturbative regime, results obtained
for null infinity are valid for what has been termed the “astrophysical
zone” by Leaver [ Lea86a , Lea86b , Bar99a ] , and which is defined as
the region where @xmath . (Note, however, that @xmath must also be
satisfied). The physical idea is that the distance from observers of
astrophysical phenomena, e.g. gravitational wave detectors, to the
radiation sources is very large compared to the time during which the
source radiates at an observable rate.

We argue that our results illustrate that the relevant falloff from the
point of view of an astrophysical observer is the falloff rate at null
infinity, in accordance with the prediction from perturbation theory. We
believe that this is a nice model calculation that exemplifies that null
infinity is indeed a useful approximation for observers at large
distance from the source, in the sense that such observers are located
in the “astrophysical zone”.

Along the same lines, we would like to point out that by taking
appropriate limits in a conformally compactified manifold, worldlines of
increasingly distant geodesic observers converge to null geodesic
generators of future null infinity and proper time converges to Bondi
time [ Fra00 ] . Note also that a naive correspondence between observers
at large distance and spatial infinity would be problematic, e.g.
compactification at spatial infinity leads to “piling up” of waves,
whereas at null infinity this effect does not appear – waves leave the
physical spacetime through the boundary at null infinity.

Under practical circumstances, null infinity more realistically
corresponds to an observer that is sufficiently far away from the source
to treat the radiation linearly, but not so far away that cosmological
effects have to be taken into account. We are however not aware of a
discussion where this sloppy picture has been made more precise.

When looking at critical collapse from a global spacetime perspective,
as we have done here, one is confronted with some issues concerning the
mass-scaling, that we would like to comment on briefly: When asking the
question of whether infinitesimally small black holes can be formed –
the question which triggered the original work on critical collapse – it
could be phrased in two slightly different ways: (i) can we form
black-hole solutions where the final-state black hole has arbitrarily
small mass, or (ii) can we form arbitrarily small apparent horizons. The
question which has been answered in the affirmative by critical collapse
research is the second one. The first one still seems open. Our results
for near-supercritical evolutions indicate that the mass outside the
past self-similarity horizon, is significantly larger than the mass
leading to scaling. We conjecture that this external mass originates
from backscattering of outgoing radiation. If this mass falls into the
black hole, then, clearly, one cannot form arbitrarily small black
holes, no matter how fine-tuned the data are.

The application of a double-null code that can penetrate apparent
horizons has not been able to decide whether the exterior matter really
falls through the horizon; instead of a null slicing, which has proven
inherently unstable close to the event horizon, we propose to use a
Cauchy evolution code for future work.

Considering the observability of critical collapse from future null
infinity in an astrophysical context, one might first object that the
matter model discussed here is unphysical. On the one hand, it was
chosen for mathematical simplicity. On the other hand, the curved space
wave equation of the simple scalar field model still shares some
essential nonlinear features inherent in the full Einstein equations
without symmetry. Moreover, it would be possible to remedy this
deficiency by using e.g. a perfect fluid or gravitational waves in
axisymmetry. A much more serious problem is the high degree of
finetunedness required in the initial data to develop sufficient
self-similar features in spacetime such that they could be detected by
far away observer.

## Appendix C Numerical Methods

### c.1 Finite Difference Methods for ODEs

Following [ AP98 ] , we consider numerical solutions to the initial
value problem (IVP)

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

on a mesh

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and let @xmath the nth step size . We assume sufficient smoothness and
boundedness on @xmath so that a unique solution @xmath exists and has as
many bounded derivatives as required. Let @xmath be the mesh function
which takes on the value @xmath at each @xmath , where the @xmath denote
approximations to the exact solution @xmath .

For the sake of simplicity, consider the forward Euler method,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We define the difference operator @xmath of the forward Euler method as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for some function @xmath defined at the mesh points. Then, @xmath
represents the discretized form of the ODE ( C.1.1 ). The local
truncation error (LTE) (or local discretization error ) ¹ ¹ 1 This
definition of the local truncation error can also be interpreted as the
error generated by a single numerical step starting from exact data and
dividing the result by @xmath : i.e. for the forward Euler method denote
the result of this step by @xmath . Then @xmath . In contrast to this
definition, the LTE is often defined by @xmath . is the residual of the
difference operator when it is applied to the exact solution:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The difference method is said to be consistent (or accurate ) of order
@xmath if

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for a positive integer @xmath . For the forward Euler method we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.1.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

thus, it is consistent of order 1.

We define the global error

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.1.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and assume that @xmath . Let @xmath and assume that @xmath is bounded
independent of @xmath . The difference method is said to be convergent
of order @xmath if the global error , @xmath , satisfies

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.1.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for @xmath .

Theorem 3.1 of [ AP98 ] states that: If a numerical method is consistent
of order @xmath and fulfills a certain concept of stability
(‘‘0-stability’’ ² ² 2 A difference method is called 0-stable if there
exist positive constants @xmath and @xmath such that for any mesh
functions @xmath and @xmath with @xmath ,

@xmath

), then it is convergent of order @xmath .

In contrast to the local truncation error, the local error is defined as
the amount by which the numerical solution @xmath at each timestep
differs from the solution @xmath to the initial value problem

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (C.1.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The local error is defined by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (C.1.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

For the numerical methods we consider here, the local error indicators
@xmath and @xmath are closely related:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (C.1.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

### c.2 Runge Kutta Methods

We discuss the Runge-Kutta methods [ AP98 ] used to solve ODEs in our
numerical codes. Runge-Kutta methods belong to the class of one-step
methods , i.e methods that do not use any information from previous
steps. In a typical step of size @xmath , we seek an approximation
@xmath to @xmath , given the result of the previous step, @xmath .

Given the scalar initial value problem

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

we can approximate the area under the curve @xmath by applying one of
the quadrature rules given in section C.2.1 to the integral in

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

on a mesh

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and let @xmath the nth step size . For instance, we can use the height
at the midpoint of the interval, i.e. @xmath , where @xmath . This
choice leads to the implicit midpoint method

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Approximating @xmath by the forward Euler method we obtain the explicit
midpoint method :

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (C.2.5)
     @xmath   @xmath      (C.2.6)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

According to equation ( C.1.6 ), both midpoint methods have a local
truncation error of @xmath and are consistent of order 2.

Applying the trapezoidal rule to C.2.2 yields the implicit trapezoidal
method

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

To obtain an explicit method, we approximate @xmath using the forward
Euler method, which yields

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (C.2.8)
     @xmath   @xmath      (C.2.9)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

This is an explicit 2-stage method of order 2, known as the explicit
trapezoidal method .

#### c.2.1 Quadrature Rules

For the sake of reference we list some very well known approximations to
the integral @xmath and their global errors:

-   Midpoint-Rectangle rule :

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (C.2.10)
      -- -------- -- ----------

-   Trapezoidal rule :

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (C.2.11)
      -- -------- -- ----------

-   1/3 Simpson’s rule :
    For the subinterval @xmath :

      -- -- -- ----------
               (C.2.12)
      -- -- -- ----------

    while for the entire interval

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (C.2.13)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    where @xmath is even.

### c.3 Error Analysis of the NSWE-algorithm

#### c.3.1 Local Errors

The local errors in the NSWE-scheme ( 3.5.2 ) of section 3.5 stem from
the approximation of the integral by evaluating the integrand at the
center of the small null parallelogram (see figure C.1 ) and from the
multiplication with the area @xmath of this diamond-shaped region.
Evaluating the integrand at the center amounts to the same as using the
average between the points @xmath and @xmath .

Assume that we know a function @xmath at the endpoints @xmath and @xmath
of a given interval (see figure C.2 ) and want to evaluate it at the
midpoint of the interval @xmath . Using linear interpolation at the
center of an interval @xmath we find

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The approximation error for the linear interpolation polynomial with
pairwise distinct nodes is (see [ DH03 ] )

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for some @xmath . Therefore, this polynomial approximation is second
order accurate.

The approximation of the integral in ( 3.5.2 ) applies the midpoint-rule
to the integrand which is multiplied by the area @xmath which is of the
order @xmath . (If @xmath , then @xmath .) Since both factors are second
order accurate, the local error of one NSWE-integration step is @xmath ,
assuming that @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are known at least to this
order.

#### c.3.2 Global Errors

In the following, we give a heuristic argument for the global error of
the NSWE-scheme. First, we restrict analysis to the fixed background
case. This entails that the NSWE-scheme is no longer coupled to the
geometry and null-geodesic ODEs, which would in general have to be
solved concurrently. To simplify matters even more, we discard the
Taylor expansion-region and use just @xmath as a startup condition. Note
that for flat space the algorithm is exact, since @xmath .

The general idea is the following: We start out from the initial slice
where @xmath is known exactly. On the next slice, we march outwards from
the origin using the NSWE-algorithm whose computational molecule is
shown in figure C.3 and accumulate local error terms of order @xmath as
illustrated in figure C.4 . If we make @xmath steps and @xmath we will
loose one order of accuracy. On the next slice, however, we are still
using @xmath -values of order @xmath near the origin. In a Cauchy code
we would accumulate errors only along the time direction. Here, we can
distinguish two directions of error accumulation: one radially outward
and another along the ingoing null-geodesics. Thus, we loose two orders
in total and the diamond algorithm turns out to be globally second order
accurate:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

For the coupled NSWE-algorithm one has to choose the orders of accuracy
for the ODE solvers such that the diamond scheme stays globally second
order accurate. In practise, second order accurate schemes (see C.2 )
have proven sufficient to ensure this.

## Appendix D Convergence Test Methodology

We briefly describe how we can check the accuracy of a numerical
evolution code using the concept of convergence tests. These tests
obtain error estimates by subtracting numerical solutions on a grid
which is shared by a set of evolutions using different (usually by
powers of two) gridspacings. Depending on whether the quantities to be
tested are zero on the continuum level or not, we take one of the
following approaches:

In a so-called 3-level convergence test , we use three different grid
resolutions, with n being the number of gridpoints in the lowest
resolution grid, and the higher ones having @xmath and @xmath
gridpoints, respectively. Without restriction of generality, we can
assume that the gridspacing on a grid of @xmath gridpoints is given by
@xmath . Assume furthermore that the discretized field @xmath is second
order accurate,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (D.0.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the continuum error functions @xmath and @xmath do not depend on
the gridspacing @xmath . Then,

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (D.0.2)
     @xmath   @xmath      (D.0.3)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

We may subtract these gridfunctions on the common gridpoints,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (D.0.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (D.0.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Comparing the last two expressions we find that on the coarsest grid

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (D.0.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

By taking a discrete spatial norm over the grid, we can compute a
time-dependent convergence factor

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (D.0.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

If the numerical scheme converges, then in the limit we should find

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (D.0.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In general we have, for @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (D.0.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath denotes the exponent of the leading error term in the
discretized field @xmath and @xmath the factor between grid resolutions.

A 2-level convergence test is applicable to discretized quantities that
are supposed to be zero on the continuum level, i.e.

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (D.0.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

It then follows that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (D.0.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

More generally we have, for @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (D.0.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------
