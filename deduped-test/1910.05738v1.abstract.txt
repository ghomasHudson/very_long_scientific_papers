In general, modified gravity theories are modifications or extensions of
Einstein's general relativity. Some of them give rise to additional scalar
degrees of freedom in Nature. If these scalar fields exist and are light
enough, they should cause a gravity-like fifth force that could, in principle,
exceed gravity in its strength. However, there are tight constraints on fifth
forces from Solar System-based tests. Screening mechanisms are popular means
for avoiding these constraints by suppressing a fifth force in regions of high
environmental mass density but allowing for phenomenologically interesting
effects in environments of lower densities. In this thesis, scalar field models
with screening mechanisms will be discussed and some astro- and quantum
physical tests for their existence presented. At first, the impact of
disformally coupled symmetrons on gravitational lensing by galaxies will be
evaluated. Secondly, it will be shown how fluctuations of a chameleon scalar
field induce the open dynamics of a quantum test particle. For this, tools from
non-equilibrium quantum field theory will be introduced, developed and applied,
and a quantum master equation derived.
