### 1.1 Deconfinement and phase diagram

The theory which describes the interaction of the color charges of
quarks and gluons is called Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In
phenomenological quark models, mesons can be described as
quark-antiquark bound states, while baryons can be considered as three
quark bound states. Up to now, it’s found that all the hadron states
which can be observed in isolation is colorless singlet states.
Experimentally, no single quark, which is described by a color-triplet
state, has ever been isolated. The absence of the observation of a
single quark in isolation suggests that the interaction between quarks
and gluons must be strong on large distance scale. In the other extreme,
much insight into the nature of the interaction between quarks and
gluons on short distance scales was provides by deep inelastic
scattering experiments. In these experiments, the incident electron
interacts with a quark within a hadron and is accompanied by the
momentum transfer from the electron to the quark. The measurement of the
electron momentum before and after the interaction allows a probe of the
momentum distribution of the parton inside the nucleon. It was found
that with very large momentum transfer, the quarks inside the hadron
behave as if they were almost free [ 1 ] . The strong coupling between
quarks and gluons at large distances and asymptotic freedom are the two
remarkable features of QCD. When the energy density is high enough
either due to the high temperature or high baryon density, the quark or
gluon may be deconfined from a hadron. The thermalized quark gluon
system is what we called quark-gluon plasma. Lattice QCD calculations,
considering two light quark flavors, predict a phase transition from a
confined phase, hadronic matter, to a deconfined phase, or quark-gluon
plasma (QGP), at a temperature of approximately

160 MeV [ 2 ] . Figure 1.1 shows the phase diagram of the hadronic and
partonic matter. A phase transition from the confined hadronic matter to
the deconfined QGP matter is expected to happen at either high
temperature or large baryon chemical potential @xmath . Recent Lattice
QCD calculations show that the QGP is far from ideal below 3 @xmath .
The nonideal nature of this strongly coupled QGP is also seen from the
deviation of the pressure, @xmath , and energy density @xmath from the
Stefan Boltzmann limit as shown in Figure from [ 4 ] .

Experiments on relativistic heavy ion collisions are designed to search
for and study the deconfined QGP matter.

### 1.2 Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions

The experimental programs in relativistic heavy ions started in 1986
using the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) at Brookhaven National
Lab (BNL) and the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at European laboratory
for particle physics (CERN). At BNL, ion beams of silicon and gold,
accelerated to momenta of 14 and 11 GeV/c per nucleon, respectively,
have been utilized in 10 fixed-target experiments. There have been 15
heavy ion experiments at CERN utilizing beams of oxygen at 60 and 200
GeV/c per nucleon, sulphur at 200 GeV/c per nucleon and Pb at 160 GeV/c
per nucleon [ 2 ] .
The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at BNL is designed for
head-on Au+Au collisions at @xmath = 200 GeV. The first RHIC run was
performed in 2000 with Au+Au collisions at @xmath = 130 GeV/c in four
experiments, STAR, PHENIX, PHOBOS and BRAHMS. The second RHIC run was in
2001 and 2002 with Au+Au and p+p collisions at @xmath = 200 GeV. The
third RHIC run was in 2002 and 2003 with d+Au and p+p collisions at
@xmath = 200 GeV.
The above mentioned relativistic heavy ion collision experiments are
designed for the search and study of the possible deconfined high energy
density matter, quark-gluon plasma. In head-on relativistic heavy ion
collisions, two nuclei can be represented as two thin disks approaching
each other at high speed because of the Lorentz contraction effect in
the moving direction. During the initial stage of the collisions, the
energy density is higher than the critical energy density from the
Lattice QCD calculation, so the quarks and gluons will be de-confined
from nucleons and form the quarks and gluons system. The large cross
section of interaction may lead to the thermalization of the quarks and
gluons system. That’s what we called the formation of quark-gluon plasma
(QGP). In this stage, the high transverse momentum ( @xmath ) jets and
@xmath pair will be produced due to the large momentum transfer. After
that, the QGP will expand and cool down and enter into the mixed-phase
expansion. The chemical freeze out point will be formed after the
inelastic interactions stop. That means that the particle yields and
ratios will not change. After the chemical freeze out, the elastic
interactions between hadrons will change the @xmath distribution of
particles. The particles will freeze out finally from the system after
the elastic interactions stop. That’s what we called the kinetic freeze
out point. In the following the important results from RHIC will be
addressed.

### 1.3 The experimental results at RHIC

#### 1.3.1 Flow

In non-central Au+Au collisions, the spatial space asymmetry will be
transferred into the momentum space asymmetry by the azimuthal asymmetry
of pressure gradients.

The azimuthal particle distributions in momentum space can be expanded
in a form of Fourier series

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath denotes the reaction plane angle. The Fourier expansion
coefficient @xmath stands for the @xmath th harmonic of the event
azimuthal anisotropies. @xmath is so called direct flow and @xmath is
the elliptic flow. The elliptic flow is generated mainly during the
highest density phase of the evolution before the initial geometry
asymmetry of the plasma disappears. Hydrodynamical calculations [ 19 ]
show most of @xmath is produced before 3 fm/c at RHIC.
Figure 1.3 shows that The @xmath of @xmath , @xmath and charged hadrons
( @xmath ) as a function of @xmath for 0–80% of the collision cross
section [ 6 ] . Also shown are the @xmath of pions, kaons, protons and
lambdas from hydrodynamical model [ 5 ] . The @xmath from hydrodynamical
model shows strong mass dependence, which fits the @xmath @xmath up to
@xmath GeV/c and fits the @xmath @xmath up to @xmath GeV/c. Even though
the @xmath from hydrodynamical model shows consistency with data at low
@xmath , however, the @xmath from experimental results show saturation
at intermediate @xmath while hydrodynamical predictions show rising
trend at the same @xmath range.

#### 1.3.2 High @xmath suppression and di-hadron azimuthal correlation

The @xmath from hydrodynamical models show consistency with data at
lower @xmath and fail to reproduce data at higher @xmath . At high
@xmath , the suppression for charged hadron production was observed in
Au+Au collisions at RHIC energy. The comparison of the spectra in Au+Au
collisions through those in p+p collisions, scaled by the number of
binary nucleon nucleon collisions is the nuclear modification factor
@xmath .

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath accounts for the collision geometry, averaged over the
event centrality class. @xmath , the equivalent number of binary @xmath
collisions, is calculated using a Glauber model. The @xmath is an
experimental variable. The high @xmath hadron suppression in central
Au+Au collisions can also be investigated by comparing the hadron
spectra in central and peripheral Au+Au collisions. That’s what we
called @xmath . @xmath is defined as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

Figure 1.4 shows @xmath of inclusive charged hadron for various
centrality bins in Au+Au collisions at @xmath =200 GeV. @xmath increases
monotonically for @xmath 2 GeV/c at all centralities and saturates near
unity for @xmath 2 GeV/c in the most peripheral bins. In contrast,
@xmath for the central bins reaches a maximum and then decreases
strongly above @xmath = 2 GeV/c, showing the suppression of the charged
hadron yield relative the @xmath reference [ 8 ] .
Suppression of high @xmath hadron production in central Au+Au collisions
relative to p+p collisions [ 8 , 17 ] has been interpreted as energy
loss of the energetic partons traversing the produced hot and dense
medium [ 9 ] , that’s so called jet quenching. If a dense partonic
matter is formed during the initial stage of a heavy-ion collision with
a large volume and a long life time (relative to the confinement scale
@xmath ), the produced large @xmath parton will interact with this dense
medium and will lose its energy via induced radiation. The energy loss
depends on the parton density of the medium. Therefore, the study of
parton energy loss can shed light on the properties of the dense matter
in the early stage of heavy-ion collisions [ 9 ] . At sufficiently high
beam energy, gluon saturation is also expected to result in a relative
suppression of hadron yield at high @xmath in A+A collisions [ 33 ] .
Also shown in the Figure 1.4 are the results from perturbative QCD
(pQCD) calculations. The Full-pQCD calculations include the partonic
energy loss, the Cronin enhancement(due to initial multiple scattering)
and the nuclear shadowing effect. The suppression is predicted to be
@xmath independent when @xmath is larger than 6 GeV/c, which is
consistent with our data. However, the discrepancy at 2-6 GeV/c was
observed between the prediction and the experimental data. This
discrepancy may be due to different mechanism for particle production at
intermediate @xmath . The particle production at intermediate @xmath
will be discussed later in this chapter.

A more differential probe of parton energy loss is the measurement of
high @xmath di-hadron azimuthal correlation relative to the reaction
plane orientation. The trigger hadron is in the range @xmath GeV/c and
the associated particle is at @xmath GeV/c. Figure 1.5 (left) shows the
high @xmath di-hadron correlation when the trigger particle is selected
in the azimuthal quadrants centered either in the reaction plane (in
plane) or orthogonal to it(out of plane). The near side di-hadron
azimuthal correlations in both cases were observed to be the same as
that in p+p collisions, while the suppression of back to back
correlation shows strong dependence on the relative angle between the
triggered high @xmath hadron and the reaction plane. This systematic
dependence is consistent with the picture of parton energy loss: the
path length for a dijet oriented out of plane is longer than that for a
dijet oriented in plane, leading to a stronger suppression of parton
energy loss in the out of plane. The dependence of parton energy loss on
the path length is predicted to be substantially larger than linear [ 9
] .
The energy lost by away side partons traversing the collision matter
must in the form of the excess of softer emerging particles due to the
transverse momentum conservation. An analysis of azimuthal correlations
between soft and hard particles has been performed for both 200 GeV p+p
and Au+Au collisions [ 11 ] at STAR as a first of attempt to trace the
degree of the degradation on the away side. With triggered hadron still
in the range @xmath 6 GeV/c, but the associated hadrons now sought over
@xmath GeV/c, combinatorial coincidences dominate this correlation and
they must be subtracted carefully by mixed-event technique and also the
elliptic flow effect was also subtracted by hand [ 11 ] . The results
demonstrate that, in comparison with the p+p and peripheral Au+Au
collisions, the momentum-balancing hadrons opposite to the high @xmath
triggered particle in central Au+Au are greater in number, much more
widely dispersed in azimuthal angle, and significantly softer in
momentum. Figure 1.5 (right) shows the @xmath of the momentum-balancing
hadrons opposite to the high @xmath trigger as a function of centrality.
The @xmath were observed to decrease from peripheral to central Au+Au
collisions. Also shown in the Figure 1.5 (right) is the @xmath of the
inclusive hadrons as a function of centrality. This study will be
extended to higher @xmath trigger particle. The results may suggest that
the moderately hard parton traversing a significant path length through
the collision matter makes substantial progress toward equilibrium with
the bulk. The rapid attainment of thermalization via multitude of softer
parton-parton interactions in the earliest collision stages would then
not be so surprising [ 13 ] .

#### 1.3.3 Particle composition in Au+Au at intermediate @xmath

As we have mentioned above, for @xmath , the pQCD model including the
parton energy loss, Cronin enhancement and nuclear shadowing can
qualitatively fit the trend of data at @xmath GeV/c, however, the
quantitative discrepancy between the model and the data is also obvious.
In the intermediate @xmath , the mechanism for particle production may
be different from that at high @xmath .
Figure 1.6 (left) shows the @xmath , K, p spectra in 0%-5% and 60%-92%
Au+Au 200 GeV collisions from [ 14 ] . It shows that the shapes of the
spectra show clear mass dependence. And in central collisions, the
@xmath , K, p yields are close to each other at @xmath GeV/c while it’s
not the case in peripheral collisions. Figure 1.6 (right) shows
proton/pion (top) and anti-proton/pion (bottom) ratios for central
0–10%, mid-central 20–30% and peripheral 60–92% in Au+Au collisions at
200 GeV [ 14 ] . It shows that the @xmath ratios increase fast from
peripheral to central collisions. In the 0-10% centrality bin, the
proton yield is even larger than pion yield at intermediate @xmath .
Figure 1.7 shows the ratio @xmath for identified mesons and baryons at
mid-rapidity calculated using centrality intervals, 0–5% vs. 40–60% of
the collision cross section from STAR measurement [ 12 ] . It seems that
for meson, the @xmath follows a common trend and for baryon, the @xmath
also follows a common trend, which is different from that for mesons.
The @xmath for baryons is observed to be larger than that for mesons.

These experimental results suggest that the degree of suppression
depends on particle species(baryon/meson) at intermediate @xmath . The
spectra of baryons (protons and lambdas) are less suppressed than those
of mesons (pions, kaons) [ 6 , 18 ] in the @xmath range @xmath GeV/c.
The baryon content in the hadrons at intermediate @xmath depends
strongly on the impact parameter (centrality) of the Au+Au collisions
with about 40% of the hadrons being baryons in the minimum-bias
collisions and 20% in very peripheral collisions [ 6 , 18 ] .
Hydrodynamics [ 19 , 20 ] , parton coalescence at hadronization [ 21 ,
22 , 23 ] and gluon junctions [ 24 ] have been suggested as explanations
for the observed particle-species dependence.

In these models, recombination/coalescence models successfully reproduce
@xmath of baryons and mesons at intermediate @xmath , as well as showing
consistency with the @xmath measurement in the same @xmath range.

##### Recombination model

The concept of quark recombination was introduced to describe hadron
production at forward rapidity in p+p collisions [ 25 ] . At forward
rapidity, this mechanism allows a fast quark resulting from a hard
parton scattering to recombine with a slow anti-quark, which could be
one in the original sea in the incident hadron, or one incited by a
gluon [ 25 ] . If a QGP is formed in the relativistic heavy ion
collisions, then one might expect coalescence of the abundant thermal
partons to provide another important hadron production mechanism, active
over a wide range of rapidity and transverse momentum [ 26 ] . In
particular, at moderate @xmath values(above the realm of hydrodynamics
applicability), the hadron production from recombination of lower @xmath
partons from thermal bath [ 21 , 22 , 23 ] has been predicted to be
competitive with the production from fragmentation of higher @xmath
scattered partons. It has been suggested [ 27 ] that the need for
substantial recombination to explain the observed hadron yield and flow
may be taken as a signature of QGP formation.
In order to explain the features of RHIC collisions, the recombination
models [ 26 , 21 , 22 , 23 ] make the central assumption that
coalescence proceeds via constituent quarks, whose number in a hadron
determines its production rate. The constituent quarks are presumed to
follow a thermal (exponential) momentum spectrum and to carry a
collective transverse velocity distributions. This picture leads to
clear predicted effects on baryon and meson production rates, with the
former depending on the spectrum of thermal constituent quarks and
antiquarks at roughly one-third the baryon @xmath , and the latter
determined by the spectrum at roughly one-half the meson @xmath .
Indeed, the recombination model was recently was re-introduced at RHIC
context, precisely to explain the abnormal abundance of baryon vs meson
observed at intermediate @xmath [ 21 , 22 , 23 ] . If the observed
saturated elliptic flow values of hadrons in this momentum range result
from coalescence of collectively flowing constituent quarks, then one
expect a similarly simple baryon vs meson relationship [ 21 , 22 , 23 ]
: the baryon (meson) flow would be 3 (2) times the quark flow at roughly
one-third (one-half) the baryon (meson) @xmath [ 13 ] .

#### 1.3.4 Summary

In summary, the several important results from RHIC have been
introduced. The elliptic flow @xmath can be reproduced by hydrodynamics
at low @xmath . At intermediate @xmath , @xmath from data show
saturation and deviate from hydrodynamical model predictions. At the
same time, @xmath from data show baryon or meson species dependence.
High @xmath suppression can be reproduced by pQCD model and gluon
saturation model. The gluon saturation model is also called color glass
condensate model (CGC). The production rate dependence on baryon or
meson species has been observed at intermediate @xmath , which can be
reproduced by the recombination model.

### 1.4 Cronin effect

#### 1.4.1 Why we need d+Au run at RHIC

In order to see the intermediate and high @xmath suppression is due to
the final-state effect or initial state effect, the measurements from
d+Au collisions will provide the essential proof. Since the initial
state in d+Au collisions is similar to that in Au+Au collisions, and,
it’s believed that the quark-gluon plasma doesn’t exist in d+Au
collisions, the results from d+Au collisions will be very important for
us to judge whether the quark-gluon plasma exists in Au+Au collisions or
not and to understand the property of the dense matter created in Au+Au
collisions. Besides, if the identified particle spectra in d+Au and p+p
collisions are measured, they will not only provide the reference for
those in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV, but also provide a chance to see
the mechanism of the Cronin effect itself clearly at 200 GeV. Cronin
effect was observed 30 years ago experimentally and the study of this
effect was only limited to lower energy fixed target experiments. Before
we go to the d+Au collisions, let’s look back on the p+A collisions at
lower energy fixed target experiment.

#### 1.4.2 Lower energy

The hadron @xmath spectra have been observed to depend on the target
atomic weight ( @xmath ) and the produced particle species in lower
energy p+A collisions [ 28 ] . This is known as the “Cronin Effect”, a
generic term for the experimentally observed broadening of the
transverse momentum distributions at intermediate @xmath in p+A
collisions as compared to those in p+p collisions [ 28 , 29 , 30 ] . The
effect can be characterized as a dependence of the yield on the target
atomic weight as @xmath . At energies of @xmath 30 GeV, @xmath depends
on @xmath and is greater than unity at high @xmath [ 28 ] , indicating
an enhancement of the production cross section. As shown in Figure 1.8 ,
the @xmath is larger than 1 in the intermediate @xmath and shows strong
particle-species dependence. The @xmath for proton and antiproton are
larger than those for kaon and pion. And @xmath for kaon is larger than
that for pion. This effect has been interpreted as partonic scatterings
at the initial impact [ 29 , 30 ] .

Besides, the lower energy data suggest the power @xmath decreases with
energy, as shown in Figure 1.8 . However, the energy dependence study of
Cronin effect is limited to fixed target experiment at lower energy.
What’s the extrapolation of Cronin effect at higher energy such as RHIC
energy 200 GeV. At higher energies, multiple parton collisions are
possible even in p+p collisions [ 32 ] . This combined with the
hardening of the spectra with increasing beam energy would reduce the
Cronin effect [ 30 ] . There are several models which give different
predictions of Cronin effect at 200 GeV.

#### 1.4.3 Predictions: RHIC energy

One of the models is the initial multiple parton scattering model. In
this model, the transverse momentum of the parton inside the proton will
be broadened when the proton traverses the Au nucleus due to the
multiple scattering between the proton and the nucleons inside the Au
nucleus. In these models, the Cronin ratio will increases to a maximum
value between 1 and 2 at 2.5 @xmath 4.5 GeV/c and then decreases with
@xmath increasing [ 30 ] . The Cronin effect is predicted to be larger
in central d+Au collisions than in d+Au peripheral collisions [ 31 ] .
Another model is the gluon saturation model. At sufficiently high beam
energy, gluon saturation is expected to result in a relative suppression
of hadron yield at high @xmath in both p+A and A+A collisions and in a
substantial decrease and finally in the disappearance of the Cronin
effect [ 33 ] .

Figure 1.9 shows the @xmath of charged hadron vs @xmath from STAR. We
can see that the Cronin ratio increases to a maximum value around 1.5 at
@xmath GeV/c and then decreases again [ 36 ] . This is consistent with
the initial multiple parton scattering model [ 30 ] . These results on
inclusive hadron production from d+Au collisions indicate that hadron
suppression at intermediate and high @xmath in Au+Au collisions is due
to final state interactions in a dense and dissipative medium produced
during the collision and not due to the initial state wave function of
the Au nucleus [ 36 , 37 ] .
Now we know that the hadron suppression at intermediate @xmath in Au+Au
collisions is due to final-state effects [ 36 , 37 ] . What’s the effect
on particle composition at the same @xmath range in Au+Au collisions?
Another question is whether there is any Cronin effect dependence on
particle-species in d+Au collisions or not. In order to further
understand the mechanisms responsible for the particle dependence of
@xmath spectra in heavy ion collisions, and to separate the effects of
initial and final partonic rescatterings, we measured the @xmath
distributions of @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath from 200 GeV d+Au
and p+p collisions. In this thesis, we discuss the dependence of
particle production on @xmath , collision energy, and target atomic
weight. And we compare the Cronin effect of @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath with models to address the mechanism for Cronin effect in d+Au
collisions at @xmath GeV.

## Chapter 2 The STAR Experiment

### 2.1 The RHIC Accelerator

The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Lab
(BNL) is the first hadron accelerator and collider consisting of two
independent ring. It is designed to operate at high collision luminosity
over a wide range of beam energies and particle species ranging from
polarized proton to heavy ion [ 41 , 42 ] , where the top energy of the
colliding center-of-mass energy per nucleon-nucleon pair is @xmath = 200
GeV. The RHIC facility consists of two super-conducting magnets, each
with a circumference of 3.8 km, which focus and guide the beams.
Figure 2.1 shows the BNL accelerator complex including the accelerators
used to bring the gold ions up to RHIC injection energy. In the first,
gold ions are accelerated to 15 MeV/nucleon in the Tandem Van de Graaff
facility. Then the beam is transferred to the Booster Synchrotron and
accelerated to 95 MeV/nucleon through the Tandem-to-Booster line. Then
the gold ions are transferred to the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron
(AGS) and accelerated to 10.8 GeV/nucleon. Finally they are injected to
RHIC and accelerated to the collision energy 100 GeV/nucleon.

RHIC’s 3.8 km ring has six intersection points where its two rings of
accelerating magnets cross, allowing the particle beams to collide. The
collisions produce the fleeting signals that, when captured by one of
RHIC’s experimental detectors, provide physicists with information about
the most fundamental workings of nature. If RHIC’s ring is thought of as
a clock face, the four current experiments are at 6 o’clock (STAR), 8
o’clock (PHENIX), 10 o’clock (PHOBOS) and 2 o’clock (BRAHMS). There are
two additional intersection points at 12 and 4 o’clock where future
experiments may be placed [ 41 ] .

### 2.2 The STAR Detector

The Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC (STAR) is one of the two large detector
systems constructed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at
Brookhaven National Laboratory. STAR was constructed to investigate the
behavior of strongly interacting matter at high energy density and to
search for signatures of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation. Key
features of the nuclear environment at RHIC are a large number of
produced particles (up to approximately one thousand per unit
pseudo-rapidity) and high momentum particles from hard parton-parton
scattering. STAR can measure many observables simultaneously to study
signatures of a possible QGP phase transition and to understand the
space-time evolution of the collision process in ultra-relativistic
heavy ion collisions. The goal is to obtain a fundamental understanding
of the microscopic structure of these hadronic interactions at high
energy densities. In order to accomplish this, STAR was designed
primarily for measurements of hadron production over a large solid
angle, featuring detector systems for high precision tracking, momentum
analysis, and particle identification at the center of mass (c.m.)
rapidity. The large acceptance of STAR makes it particularly well suited
for event-by-event characterizations of heavy ion collisions and for the
detection of hadron jets [ 43 ] .
The layout of the STAR experiment [ 44 ] is shown in Figure 2.2 . A
cutaway side view of the STAR detector as configured for the RHIC 2001
run is displayed in Figure 2.3 . A room temperature solenoidal magnet [
45 ] with a maximum magnetic field of 0.5 T provides a uniform magnetic
field for charged particle momentum analysis. Charged particle tracking
close to the interaction region is accomplished by a Silicon Vertex
Tracker [ 46 ] (SVT). The Silicon Drift Detectors [ 47 ] (SDD) installed
after 2001 is also for the inner tracking. The silicon detectors cover a
pseudo-rapidity range @xmath with complete azimuthal symmetry ( @xmath
). Silicon tracking close to the interaction allows precision
localization of the primary interaction vertex and identification of
secondary vertices from weak decays of, for example, @xmath , @xmath ,
and @xmath . A large volume Time Projection Chamber [ 48 , 38 ] (TPC)
for charged particle tracking and particle identification is located at
a radial distance from 50 to 200 cm from the beam axis. The TPC is 4
meters long and it covers a pseudo-rapidity range @xmath for tracking
with complete azimuthal symmetry ( @xmath ). Both the SVT and TPC
contribute to particle identification using ionization energy loss, with
an anticipated combined energy loss resolution (dE/dx) of 7 % ( @xmath
). The momentum resolution of the SVT and TPC reach a value of @xmath
p/p = 0.02 for a majority of the tracks in the TPC. The @xmath p/p
resolution improves as the number of hit points along the track
increases and as the particle’s momentum decreases, as expected [ 43 ] .
To extend the tracking to the forward region, a radial-drift TPC (FTPC)
[ 50 ] is installed covering @xmath , also with complete azimuthal
coverage and symmetry. To extend the particle identification in STAR to
larger momenta over a small solid angle for identified single-particle
spectra at mid-rapidity, a ring imaging Cherenkov detector [ 51 ]
covering @xmath and @xmath , and a time-of-flight patch (TOFp) [ 73 ]
covering @xmath and @xmath (as shown in Figure 2.3 ) was installed at
STAR in 2001 [ 43 ] . In 2003, a time-of-flight tray (TOFr) based on
multi-gap resistive plate chamber (MRPC) technology [ 39 ] was installed
in STAR detector, covering @xmath and @xmath . For the time-of-flight
system, the Pseudo-Vertex Position Detectors (pVPD) was installed as the
start-timing detector, which was 5.4 m away from TPC center and covers
@xmath with the azimuthal coverage 19% [ 73 ] in 2003.
The fast detectors that provide input to the trigger system are a
central trigger barrel (CTB) at @xmath and two zero-degree calorimeters
(ZDC) located in the forward directions at @xmath mrad. The CTB
surrounds the outer cylinder of the TPC, and triggers on the flux of
charged particles in the mid-rapidity region. The ZDCs are used for
determining the energy in neutral particles remaining in the forward
directions [ 43 ] . A minimum bias trigger was obtained by selecting
events with a pulse height larger than that of one neutron in each of
the forward ZDCs, which corresponds to 95 percent of the geometrical
cross section [ 43 ] .

#### 2.2.1 The Time Projection Chamber

The STAR detector [ 44 ] uses the TPC as its primary tracking device.
The TPC records the tracks of particles, measures their momenta, and
identifies the particles by measuring their ionization energy loss (
@xmath ). Particles are identified over a momentum range from 100 MeV/c
to greater than 1 GeV/c and momenta are measured over a range of 100
MeV/c to 30 GeV/c [ 38 ] .
The STAR TPC is shown schematically in Figure 2.4 . It is a volume of
gas in a well defined uniform electric field of @xmath 135 V/cm. The
working gas of TPC is P10 gas (10% methane, 90% argon) regulated at 2
mbar above atmospheric pressure [ 54 ] . This gas has long been used in
TPCs. Its primary attribute is a fast drift velocity which peaks at a
low electric field. Operating on the peak of the velocity curve makes
the drift velocity stable and insensitive to small variations in
temperature and pressure [ 38 ] . The paths of primary ionizing
particles passing through the gas volume are reconstructed with high
precision from the released secondary electrons which drift to the
readout end caps at the ends of the chamber. The drift velocity of
electrons is 5.45 cm/ @xmath s. The uniform electric field which is
required to drift the electrons is defined by a thin conductive Central
Membrane (CM) at the center of the TPC, concentric field cage cylinders
and the read out end caps [ 38 ] . The readout system is based on Multi
Wire Proportional Chambers (MWPC) with readout pads. The drifting
electrons avalanche in the high fields at the 20 @xmath m anode wires
providing an amplification of 1000 to 3000. The induced charge from an
avalanche is shared over several adjacent pads, so the original track
position can be reconstructed to a small fraction of a pad width. There
are a total of 136,608 pads in the readout system [ 38 ] , which give
@xmath - @xmath coordinate information. The @xmath position information
is provided by 512 time buckets.

At the Data Acquisition (DAQ) stage, raw events containing millions of
ADC values and TDC values were recorded. Raw data were then
reconstructed into hits, tracks, vertices, and the collision vertex
through the reconstruction chain of TPC [ 55 ] by Kalman method. The
collision vertex are called the primary vertex. The tracks are called
the global tracks. If the 3-dimensional distance of closest approach
(DCA/dca) of the global track to the primary vertex is less than 3 cm,
this track will be chosen for a re-fit by forcing a new track helix
ending at the primary vertex. These newly reconstructed helices are
called primary tracks [ 81 ] . As expected, the vertex resolution
decreases as the square root of the number of tracks used in the
calculation. The vertex resolution is 350 @xmath m when there are more
than 1,000 tracks [ 38 ] . Figure 2.5 shows the beam’s eye view of a
central Au+Au collision event in the STAR TPC.

##### Particle Identification (PID) of TPC by dE/dx

Energy lost in the TPC gas is a valuable tool for identifying particle
species. It works especially well for low momentum particles but as the
particle energy rises, the energy loss becomes less mass-dependent and
it is hard to separate particles with velocities @xmath c [ 38 ] . For a
particle with charge @xmath (in units of @xmath ) and speed @xmath
passing through a medium with density @xmath , the mean energy loss it
suffers can be described by the Bethe-Bloch formula

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is Avogadro’s number, @xmath is the electron mass, @xmath (
@xmath ) is the classical electron radius, @xmath is the speed of light,
@xmath is the atomic number of the absorber, @xmath is the atomic weight
of the absorber, @xmath , @xmath is the mean excitation energy, and
@xmath ( @xmath ) is the maximum transferable energy in a single
collision [ 83 , 81 ] . From the above equation, we can see that
different charged particles (electron, muon, pion, kaon, proton or
deuteron) with the same momentum @xmath passing through the TPC gas can
result in different energy loss. Figure 2.6 shows the energy loss for
particles in the TPC as a function of the particle momentum, which
includes both primary and secondary particles. We can see that charged
pions and kaons can be identified up to about transverse momentum 0.75
GeV/c and protons and anti-protons can be identified to 1.1 GeV/c.

In order to quantitatively describe the particle identification, we
define the variable @xmath (in the case of charged pion identification)
as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

in which @xmath is the number of hits for a track in the TPC, @xmath is
the measured energy loss of a track and @xmath is the mean energy loss
for charged pions. In order to identify charged kaons, protons and
anti-protons, we can have similar definition of @xmath and @xmath . Thus
we can cut on the variables @xmath , @xmath and @xmath to select
different particle species [ 81 ] .
A specific part of the particle identification is the topological
identification of neutral particles, such as the @xmath and @xmath .
These neutral particles can be reconstructed by identifying the
secondary vertex, commonly called V0 vertex, of their charged daughter
decay modes, @xmath and @xmath [ 81 ] .

#### 2.2.2 The time-of-flight tray based on MRPC technology

In 2003, the time-of-flight tray (TOFr) based on multi-gap resistive
plate chamber (MRPC) technology [ 39 ] was installed in STAR detector.
It extends particle identification up to @xmath GeV/c for @xmath and
@xmath . This tray was installed on the Au beam outgoing direction. MRPC
technology was first developed by the CERN ALICE group [ 56 ] to provide
a cost-effective solution for large-area time-of-flight coverage. For
full time-of-flight coverage at STAR, there will be 120 trays, with 60
on east side and 60 on west side. For each tray, there will be 33 MRPCs.
For each MRPC, there are 6 read-out channels. Figure 2.7 shows the tray
which indicates the position of each MRPC module. The MRPCs are tilted
differently so that each MRPC is most projective to the average primary
vertex location at Z=0. In 2003 d+Au and p+p run, only 28 MRPCs were
installed in the tray and 12 out of 28 were instrumented with the
electronics, representing 0.3% of TPC coverage. If we number the 33
MRPCs in the tray from 1 to 33, with 1 close to TPC center and 33 far
from TPC center, the numbers of 12 modules instrumented with the
electronics in 2003 are 3,4,5,7,9,10,11,12,13,14,26 and 32.

##### The introduction of MRPC

Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) were developed in 1980s [ 57 ] , and
were originally operated in streamer mode. This operation mode allows us
to get high detection efficiency ( @xmath 95%) and time resolution ( 1
ns), with low fluxes of incident particles. At higher fluxes ( @xmath
200 @xmath ), RPCs begin to lose their efficiency. A way to overcome
this problem is to operate RPCs in avalanche mode. The Multi-gap
Resistive Plate Chamber (MRPC) was developed less than 10 years ago [ 58
] . It consists of a stack of resistive plates, spaced one from the
other with equal sized spacers creating a series of gas gaps. Electrodes
are connected to the outer surfaces of the stack of resistive plates
while all the internal plates are left electrically floating. Initially
the voltage on these internal plates is given by electrostatics, but
they are kept at the correct voltage due to the flow of electrons and
ions created in the avalanches. Figure 2.8 shows the structure of MRPC
detector. For each MRPC, there are 6 read-out strips. Figure 2.9 shows
the shape of the read-out strip. The detailed production process can be
found at Appendix B.
MRPC, as a new kind of detector for time of fight system, operated in
avalanche mode with a non flammable gas mixture of 90% F134A, 5%
isobutane, 5% SF6, can fulfill all these requirements: high efficiency (
@xmath 95%), excellent intrinsic time resolution ( @xmath 100 ps) [ 69 ,
39 , 70 , 71 , 72 ] , high rate capability ( 500 @xmath ), high
modularity and simplicity for construction, good uniformity of response,
high granularity/low occupancy, and large acceptance.

##### Simulation: the work principle of this chamber

A detailed description of the model used in the simulation was reported
in these papers [ 59 , 60 , 61 , 62 ] , here just the main items will be
repeated. The program starts from considering an ionizing particle which
crosses the gas gaps and generates a certain number of clusters of
ion-electron pairs. The electrons contained in the clusters drift
towards the anode and, if the electric field is sufficiently high, give
rise to the avalanche processes.
The primary cluster numbers and the avalanche growth are assumed to
follow, respectively, simple Poisson statistics and the usual
exponential law. Avalanche gain fluctuations have been taken into
account using a Polya distribution [ 63 ] . After the simulation of the
drifting avalanches, the program computes, by means of Ramo [ 64 ]
theorem, the charge @xmath induced on the external pick-up electrodes
(strips or pads) by the avalanche motion. Under certain approximations,
this is given by the formula

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the electron charge, @xmath 1st effective Townsend
coefficient @xmath , @xmath is the Townsend coefficient, @xmath is the
attachment coefficient, @xmath the @xmath cluster initial distances from
the anode, @xmath the gap width, @xmath the number of initial electrons
in the considered @xmath cluster, @xmath the avalanche gain fluctuations
factor, and @xmath is the normalized weighting field. In addition to
@xmath , the current @xmath induced on the same electrodes by the
drifting charge @xmath may be computed as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

, where @xmath is the electron drift velocity. The computation of @xmath
allows us to reproduce the whole information coming out from MRPC, such
as time distribution.
Charge Spectrum Simulation : The almost Gaussian charge distribution
obtained with the MRPC is a key ingredient to its performance. If the
avalanches grew following Townsend’s formula the charge distribution
would be exponential in shape. Thus the space charge effects must be
considered in the simulation.
The input parameters for the simulation program are: the Townsend
coefficient @xmath , the attachment coefficient @xmath , the average
distance between clusters @xmath and the probability distribution of the
number of electrons per cluster. These pieces of information can be
obtained, for a given gas mixture and given conditions (pressure and
temperature) and electric field, by the programs HEED [ 65 ] and
MAGBOLTZ [ 66 , 67 ] . In addition, a maximum number of electrons in an
avalanche (cutoff value) is specified.
In a given gap, we generate a number of clusters with distances
exponentially distributed with average distance @xmath . For each
cluster, we then generate a certain number of electrons, according to
the distribution obtained by the program HEED. Each electron from the
primary cluster will give rise to a number of electrons, generated
according to an exponential probability law.

For each cluster, the avalanche growth is stopped when the total charge
reaches a certain cutoff value, as originally suggested in ref. [ 68 ]
to take into account space charge effects in the avalanche development.
This cutoff value has been set to be @xmath electrons.
In Figure 2.10 we show the results of simulations, Figure 2.10 (a) is
the simulated curve of the 1st effective Townsend coefficient @xmath
versus the electric field, which is generated by Magboltz. The curve
shows that the correlation between @xmath and the electric field is
almost linear when MRPC is operated at high electric field for the gas
mixture. Figure 2.10 (b) is the charge spectrum for a 6 gap chamber and
(c) (d) for a 10 gap chamber compared to experimental data [ 69 , 39 ] ,
and the number under each plot shows the electric field @xmath in the
gas gap for MRPC. In both cases the gap size is 220 @xmath . The gas
mixture was 90% F134A, 5% isobutane and 5% SF6 in normal conditions of
pressure and temperature. The value of @xmath used was 0.1 @xmath ,
derived from HEED program.
The charge distribution has an almost Gaussian form, especially for the
10 gap MRPC. The left side of the distribution (very few events at
values near zero) is due to the fact that the MRPC operates at high gain
@xmath . This means that avalanches starting in the middle of the gap
width, which only avalanche over half the distance, give a detectable
signal. The charge distribution is the superposition of several
probability distributions which, according to the central limit theorem,
will tend to a Gaussian form. The right side of the charge distribution
(the fact that the tails are not very long) indicates that indeed the
space charge effects stop the development of the avalanche.

Time Distribution Simulation: We then proceed to simulate the time
distribution of these same chambers. The electron drift velocity can be
obtained from HEED. When the total induced charge signal is over
threshold, the time is recorded. In this paper, the threshold is 13 fc
for the 6 gap MRPC and 26 fc for the 10 gap MRPC. Fig.2 is the simulated
results for a 6 gap chamber. Figure 2.11 (a) is the simulated curve of
the electron drift velocity versus the electric field, which is
generated by Magboltz. Figure 2.11 (b) is the time distribution of a 6
gap MRPC. The intrinsic time resolution is only 19 ps or so. If we
consider other contributions, such as front-end electronics 30 ps, TDC
resolution 25 ps, fanout start signal 10 ps, beam size (1cm) 15 ps, we
can get the MRPC resolution is @xmath ps. This value is similar to the
experimental result [ 69 , 39 ] . For a 10 gap MRPC, the intrinsic time
resolution is about 15 ps.
From the simulation, we can get the bottom line of MRPC time resolution
@xmath ps. And we need to keep control of all these contributions to
ensure best time resolution.

##### MRPC for this tray installed in 2003

In 2003, for the MRPCs in the TOFr, the inner glass thickness is 0.54
mm, the outer glass is 1.1 mm. The gas gap is 0.22 mm. Both the volume
resistivity ( @xmath ) of the glass plates and the surface
resistivity(2M ohm per square) of carbon layer at room temperature are
presented in [ 75 ] . It is found the volume resistivity of the plate
decreases with the temperature increasing. And the radiation will
decrease the volume resistivity of the plate [ 75 ] . In order not to
pollute the working gas of TPC, SF6 is not used as part of the working
gas of TOFr. The working gas of MRPC-TOFr at STAR is 95% freon and 5%
iso-butane at normal atmospheric pressure. The high voltage applied to
the electrodes is 14.0 kV.

## Chapter 3 Analysis Methods

### 3.1 Trigger

The detector used for these studies was the Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC
(STAR). The main tracking device is the Time Projection Chamber (TPC)
which provides momentum information and particle identification for
charged particles up to @xmath GeV/c by measuring their ionization
energy loss ( dE/dx ) [ 38 ] . Detailed descriptions of the TPC and d+Au
run conditions have been presented in Ref. [ 36 , 38 ] . A prototype
time-of-flight detector (TOFr) based on multi-gap resistive plate
chambers (MRPC) [ 39 ] was installed in STAR for the d+Au and p+p runs.
It extends particle identification up to @xmath GeV/c for @xmath and
@xmath .

TOFr covers @xmath in azimuth and @xmath in pseudorapidity at a radius
of @xmath cm. It contains 28 MRPC modules which were partially
instrumented during the 2003 run. Since the acceptance of TOFr is small,
a special trigger selected events with a valid pVPD coincidence and at
least one TOFr hit. A total of 1.89 million and 1.08 million events were
used for the analysis from TOFr triggered d+Au and non-singly
diffractive (NSD) p+p collisions, representing an integrated luminosity
of about 40 @xmath and 30 @xmath , respectively. Minimum-bias d+Au and
p+p collisions that did not require pVPD and TOFr hits were also used to
study the trigger bias and enhancement, and the TOFr efficiency and
acceptance. The d+Au minimum-bias trigger required an equivalent energy
deposition of about 15 GeV in the Zero Degree Calorimeter in the Au beam
direction [ 36 ] . The trigger efficiency was determined to be @xmath .
Minimum-bias p+p events were triggered by the coincidence of two
beam-beam counters (BBC) covering @xmath [ 8 ] . The NSD cross section
was measured to be @xmath mb by a van der Meer scan and PYTHIA [ 76 ]
simulation of the BBC acceptance [ 8 ] .

#### 3.1.1 Centrality tagging

Centrality tagging of d+Au collisions was based on the charged particle
multiplicity in @xmath , measured by the Forward Time Projection Chamber
in the Au beam direction [ 36 , 78 ] . The TOFr triggered d+Au events
were divided into three centralities: most central @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath of the hadronic cross section. The average number of binary
collisions @xmath for each centrality class and for the combined
minimum-bias event sample is derived from Glauber model calculations and
listed in Table 3.1 .

Table 3.1 also lists the uncorrected FTPC east reference multiplicity
ranges for centrality definitions.

#### 3.1.2 Trigger bias study

Since we set up a special trigger which selected events with a valid
pVPD coincidence and at least one TOFr hit, the study of @xmath
dependence of trigger bias is necessary. Figure 3.1 shows there is
negligible trigger bias on @xmath dependence at @xmath 0.3 GeV/c from
simulation. In this figure, pVPD means that pVPD is required to fire in
minimum-bias collisions. TOF means that TOFr is required to fire in
minimum-bias collisions, and pVPD @xmath TOF means that pVPD and TOFr
are required to fire in minimum-bias collisions. From this figure, if we
required pVPD and TOFr to fire, we can see the ratio is flat with @xmath
when @xmath is larger than 0.3 GeV/c by comparison through the @xmath
distribution in minimum-bias collisions. That means the trigger bias for
@xmath distribution is negligible at @xmath 0.3 GeV/c.

Minimum-bias d+Au and p+p collisions are used to study the trigger bias
and enhancement. Figure 3.2 shows the trigger bias and enhancement in
d+Au minimum-bias collisions and three centrality bins. In this figure,
TOFr means that TOFr is required to fire in minimum-bias events. pVPD
means that TOFr and pVPD are required to fire in minimum-bias events.
Minbias means the minimum-bias triggered events. For enhancement study,
TOFr/pVPD is the ratio of the number of events in which TOFr is required
to fire over the number of events in which TOFr and pVPD are required to
fire, and Minbias/pVPD is the ratio of the number of minimum-bias
triggered events over the number of events in which TOFr and pVPD are
required to fire. The enhancement factor for TOFr is
(Minbias/pVPD)/(TOFr/pVPD). For example, in minimum-bias collision,
Minbias/pVPD is equal to 28.7, while TOFr/pVPD is 2.87, so in
minimum-bias collisions, the enhancement of TOFr trigger is 10. For
@xmath bias study, TOFr/pVPD is the ratio of @xmath in the events where
TOFr is required to fire over the @xmath in the events where TOFr and
pVPD are required to fire. Since in our triggered events, TOFr and pVPD
are required to fire, TOFr/pVPD is our @xmath bias factor. The curves in
this figure show the charged particle multiplicity at mid-rapidity in
TOFr events and in TOFr and pVPD events individually. Table 3.2 lists
the enhancement factor and trigger bias in minimum-bias, centrality
selected d+Au collisions and minimum-bias p+p collisions.

### 3.2 Track selection and calibration

The TPC and TOFr are two independent systems. In the analysis, hits from
particles traversing the TPC were reconstructed as tracks with well
defined geometry, momentum, and dE/dx [ 38 ] . The particle trajectory
was then extended outward to the TOFr detector plane. The pad with the
largest signal within one pad distance to the projected point was
associated with the track for further time-of-flight and velocity (
@xmath ) calculations.

#### 3.2.1 Calibration

##### pVPD calibration

For TOFr, we use pVPD as our start-timing detector. In d+Au and p+p
collisions, at least one east pVPD and one west pVPD were required to
fire. In d+Au collisions, to calibrate east pVPD, we required 3 east
pVPD to fire; to calibrate west pVPD, we required 3 west pVPD to fire.
In p+p collisions, to calibrate east pVPD, we required 2 east pVPD to
fire; to calibrate west pVPD, we required 2 west pVPD to fire. Let’s
take the east pVPD calibration in d+Au collisions as an example. The
label for 3 pVPD are pVPD1, pVPD2, pVPD3, the adc and tdc value for
pVPD1 are @xmath , @xmath , and the slewing correction function is
@xmath ; the adc and tdc value for pVPD2 are @xmath , @xmath , and the
slewing correction function is @xmath ; the adc and tdc value for pVPD3
are @xmath , @xmath , and the slewing correction function is @xmath . We
use @xmath vs @xmath to get the slewing correction for pVPD1; use @xmath
vs @xmath to get the slewing correction for pVPD2; use @xmath vs @xmath
to get the slewing correction for pVPD3. At the beginning, @xmath , we
got 3 curves of @xmath vs @xmath , @xmath vs @xmath and @xmath vs @xmath
. The 3 curves corresponded to the 3 slewing functions @xmath ; For the
second step, @xmath , also plot @xmath vs @xmath , @xmath vs @xmath and
@xmath vs @xmath . And we got the new three slewing curves @xmath . For
the third step, @xmath , also plot @xmath vs @xmath , @xmath vs @xmath
and @xmath vs @xmath . And we got another new three slewing curves
@xmath . And so on and so forth till the resolution of @xmath and @xmath
converged. The looping method is to subtract the correlation of
different pVPD tubes in the same direction. The function for the slewing
correction we use is @xmath . In Figure 3.3 , the left plot shows the
pVPD2 slewing plot and the right plot shows that the timing is
independent on the ADC value after the slewing correction.

After the slewing correction, we got the corrected timing of east pVPD
and west pVPD. For each side, the timing difference should be shifted to
zero. That’s to say the mean value in the distribution of @xmath and
@xmath were shifted to zero. Also we need to correct for the effect
caused by the different numbers of fired pVPD in different events. What
we did was shifting the mean value of the distribution of ( @xmath to
zero, where the @xmath , @xmath means the sum of the corrected timing of
east fired pVPD and west fired pVPD respectively, @xmath means the
number of east fired pVPD and west fired pVPD, @xmath is the @xmath
value of primary vertex of the event, and @xmath is the light velocity.

##### TOFr calibration

After the slewing correction for pVPD, we use this variable as our start
timing:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

The difference between TOFr timing @xmath and start timing @xmath is our
time of flight @xmath . To calibrate the @xmath , the pure pion sample
was chosen by selecting the particle energy loss @xmath in TPC at @xmath
GeV/cm in the momentum range @xmath GeV/c. Figure 3.4 shows dE/dx vs
@xmath plot from d+Au collisions. Firstly the so called @xmath
correction was done due to the different cable lengths for different
read-out channels, which was done by shifting the mean value of the
distribution of @xmath to zero channel by channel, where @xmath is the
calculation timing assuming the particle was pion particle. Secondly,
the slewing correction due to correlation between timing and signal
amplitude of the electronics was done by getting the curve of @xmath vs
@xmath for each channel, where the @xmath was the time of flight after
the @xmath correction and @xmath was the ADC value of TOFr. The slewing
curve is like the plot shown in Figure 3.5 . The function of the slewing
correction is @xmath .

The z position correction was also done since the different hit
positions on the read-out strip will generate different transmission
timing. This was done by getting the function of @xmath versus @xmath ,
where the @xmath is the time of flight after the @xmath and slewing
correction, and @xmath is the the hit local z position of the TOFr. The
function for the z position correction is @xmath . The z position
correction for all the channels is shown in Figure 3.6 . After the z
position was done, the calibration for TOFr was finished. The overall
resolution of TOFr was 120 ps and 160 ps in d+Au and p+p collisions
respectively, where the effective timing resolution of the pVPDs was 85
ps and 140 ps, respectively. Figure 3.7 shows the overall resolution of
TOFr in d+Au and p+p collisions.

### 3.3 Raw yield

From the timing information @xmath from TOFr after the calibration and
the pathlength @xmath from TPC, the velocity @xmath of the particle can
be easily got by @xmath . Figure 3.8 shows @xmath from TOFr measurement
as a function of momentum ( @xmath ) calculated from TPC tracking in
TOFr triggered d+Au collisions. The raw yields of @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath are obtained from Gaussian fits to the distributions
in @xmath in each @xmath bin.

#### 3.3.1 @xmath raw yield extraction

For @xmath , the rapidity range is @xmath . After @xmath was required,
the mass squared @xmath distributions in different @xmath bin in d+Au
minimum-bias collisions are shown is Figure 3.16 and Figure 3.17 . At
@xmath GeV/c, the single Gaussian function was used to fit the
distribution of @xmath to get the raw yield. At the same time, the
counting result by counting the track number at the range @xmath @xmath
was also used to compare with the raw yield from the fitting method. The
difference between them was found in one sigma range. The raw yield we
quote is from the fitting method. At @xmath GeV/c, the double Gaussian
function was used to extract the raw yield. The raw signals in each
@xmath bin are shown in Table 3.3 and Table 3.4 . Also shown in the
tables are those in centrality selected d+Au collisions and minimum-bias
p+p collisions.

#### 3.3.2 @xmath raw yield extraction

For @xmath , the rapidity range is @xmath . After @xmath was required,
the mass squared @xmath distributions in different @xmath bin in d+Au
minimum-bias collisions are shown is Figure 3.18 and Figure 3.19 . At
@xmath GeV/c, the single Gaussian function was used to fit the
distribution of @xmath to get the raw yield. At the same time, the
counting result by counting the track number at the range @xmath @xmath
was also used to compare with the raw yield from the fitting method. The
difference between them was found in one sigma range. The raw yield we
quote is from the fitting method. At @xmath GeV/c, the double Gaussian
function was used to extract the raw yield. The raw signals in each
@xmath bin are shown in Table 3.5 and Table 3.6 . Also shown in the
tables are those in centrality selected d+Au collisions and minimum-bias
p+p collisions.

#### 3.3.3 @xmath and @xmath raw yield extraction

For @xmath , the rapidity range is @xmath . After @xmath was required,
the mass squared @xmath distributions in different @xmath bin in d+Au
minimum-bias collisions are shown is Figure 3.21 . At @xmath GeV/c, the
single Gaussian function was used to fit the distribution of @xmath to
get the raw yield. At the same time, the counting result by counting the
track number at the range @xmath @xmath was also used to compare with
the raw yield from the fitting method. The difference between them was
found in one sigma range. The raw yield we quote is from the fitting
method. At @xmath GeV/c, the double Gaussian function was used to
extract the raw yield. The raw signals in each @xmath bin are shown in
Table 3.8 . For the @xmath , the raw yield extraction method is the same
as @xmath except that at @xmath GeV/c, we use the method @xmath to
reject the background, where @xmath and @xmath are the number of the
@xmath and @xmath tracks individually, and @xmath is the ratio of @xmath
tracks at @xmath cm over those at @xmath cm. In Figure 3.20 , the first
10 @xmath bins are for @xmath cm, the last 4 @xmath bins are for @xmath
cm. Figure 3.9 shows the ratio of @xmath tracks at @xmath cm over those
at @xmath cm. After this correction of @xmath , the @xmath raw signals
in each @xmath bin are shown in Table 3.7 .

### 3.4 Efficiency and acceptance correction

Acceptance and efficiency were studied by Monte Carlo simulations and by
matching TPC track and TOFr hits in real data. TPC tracking efficiency
was studied by Monte Carlo simulations. The simulated @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath are generated using a flat @xmath and a flat @xmath
distribution and pass through GSTAR [ 82 ] (the framework software
package to run the STAR detector simulation using GEANT [ 84 , 85 ] )
and TRS (the TPC Response Simulator [ 82 ] ). The simulated @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath are then combined with a real raw event and
we call this combined event a simulated event. This simulated event is
then passed through the standard STAR reconstruction chain and we call
this event after reconstruction a reconstructed event. The reconstructed
information of those particles in the reconstructed event is then
associated with the Monte-Carlo information in the simulated event. And
then we get the total number of simulated @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath from simulated events in a certain transverse momentum bin. Also
we can get the total number of associated tracks in the reconstructed
events in this transverse momentum bin [ 81 ] . In the end, take the
ratio of the number of associated @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
over the number of simulated @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath and
this ratio is the TPC reconstruction efficiency for a certain transverse
momentum bin in the mid-rapidity range. Figure 3.10 shows the TPC
reconstruction efficiency of @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath as a
function of @xmath .

The Matching Efficiency from TPC to TOFr were studied in real data, and
the formula are

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the @xmath is the number of TOFr matched tracks per dAuTOFr
trigger event, @xmath is the number of minimum-bias tracks per
minimum-bias event by requiring the pVPD to fire, @xmath is the
enhancement factor of dAuTOFr trigger, and @xmath is the other factors
such as the TOFr trip factor. The @xmath includes the detector response
efficiency. Figure 3.11 shows the matching efficiency of different
particle species including the detector response versus @xmath . The
detector response efficiency, including the material absorption and
scattering effect between TPC and TOFr, as a function of @xmath is shown
in Figure 3.12 , which is around 90% at @xmath 0.3 GeV/c. After the
material absorption and scattering effect correction, the detector
response efficiency is around 95%.

### 3.5 Background correction

Weak-decay feeddown (e.g. @xmath ) to pions is @xmath at low @xmath and
@xmath at high @xmath , and was corrected for using PYTHIA [ 76 ] and
HIJING [ 77 ] simulations, as shown in Figure 3.13 . For @xmath spectra,
the @xmath misidentification was also corrected for, which is also shown
in Figure 3.13 .

Inclusive @xmath and @xmath production is presented without hyperon
feeddown correction. @xmath and @xmath from hyperon decays have the same
detection efficiency as primary @xmath and @xmath [ 79 ] and contribute
about 20% to the inclusive @xmath and @xmath yield, as estimated from
the simulation. However, for @xmath , there is still some scattering
contribution which comes from the beam pipe interaction after the cut of
@xmath cm. Figure 3.14 shows the contribution of scattering effect for
proton when we cut @xmath cm. The correction is done at @xmath 1.1 GeV/c
and negligible at higher @xmath .

### 3.6 Energy loss correction

The energy loss effect due to the interaction with the detector material
was also corrected for. This was studied by simulation. Figure 3.15
shows the momentum and transverse momentum correction for energy loss
effect. At @xmath 0.35 GeV/c, for @xmath , the energy loss effect is
negligible while for kaon and proton, the energy loss correction is
non-negligible at lower @xmath and negligible at higher @xmath . The
correction was done by shifting the position of @xmath in the @xmath
spectra.

### 3.7 Normalization

The efficiency including vertex efficiency and trigger efficiency is 91%
in d+Au minimum-bias collisions and 85% in p+p and 40-100% d+Au
collisions. In 0%-20% and 20%-40% d+Au collisions, the efficiency is
100%. Since the statistic of p+p minimum-bias events in run 3 is not
good enough for us to get very precise enhancement factor and @xmath
bias factor. We compare the @xmath spectra in the first 5 @xmath bin
with those from the paper [ 35 ] and get the additional normalization
factor for p+p collisions.

## Chapter 4 Results

### 4.1 @xmath and @xmath spectra in d+Au and p+p collisions at
mid-rapidity

The invariant yields @xmath of @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath from
both NSD p+p and minimum-bias d+Au events at mid-rapidity @xmath are
shown in Figure 4.1 , where @xmath is the corrected signal number per
minimum-bias event in each @xmath bin. @xmath , where @xmath is the raw
signal number in each @xmath bin, @xmath is the total TOFr triggered
events, @xmath is the enhancement factor of TOFr trigger, @xmath is the
TPC efficiency times TOFr matching efficiency, @xmath is the background
correction factor, @xmath is the @xmath bias factor, and @xmath is the
vertex efficiency times trigger efficiency and normalization factor.

#### 4.1.1 Systematic uncertainty

For the invariant yield of @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , the
average bin-to-bin systematic uncertainty was estimated to be of the
order of 8%. The systematic uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty
in the detector response in Monte Carlo simulations ( @xmath ).
Additional factors contributing to the total systematic uncertainty
include the background correction ( @xmath ), the small @xmath
acceptance of the TOFr ( @xmath ), TOFr response ( @xmath ), the
correction for energy loss in the detector ( @xmath at @xmath GeV/c for
the @xmath and @xmath , much smaller for other species and negligible at
higher @xmath ), absorption of @xmath in the material ( @xmath ), and
the momentum resolution correction ( @xmath ). The normalization
uncertainties in d+Au minimum-bias and p+p NSD collisions are @xmath and
@xmath , respectively [ 8 , 36 ] . The charged pion yields are
consistent with @xmath yields measured by the PHENIX collaboration in
the overlapping @xmath range [ 17 , 37 ] . The invariant yields of
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath in minimum-bias, centrality selected
d+Au and minimum-bias p+p collisions, are listed in the tables in
Appendix A with statistical errors and systematic uncertainties.

### 4.2 Cronin effect

Nuclear effects on hadron production in d+Au collisions are measured
through comparison to the p+p spectrum, scaled by the number of
underlying nucleon-nucleon inelastic collisions using the ratio

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath describes the nuclear geometry, and @xmath for p+p
inelastic collisions is derived from the measured p+p NSD cross section.
The difference between NSD and inelastic differential cross sections at
mid-rapidity, as estimated from PYTHIA [ 76 ] , is @xmath at low @xmath
and negligible at @xmath GeV/c. Figure. 4.2 shows @xmath of @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath for minimum-bias and central d+Au collisions. The
systematic uncertainties on @xmath are of the order of 16%, dominated by
the uncertainty in normalization. The @xmath of the same particle
species are similar between minimum-bias and top 20% d+Au collisions. In
both cases, the @xmath of protons rise faster than @xmath of pions and
kaons. We observe that the spectra of @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath are considerably harder in d+Au than those in p+p collisions. The
@xmath of the identified particles has characteristics of the Cronin
effect [ 28 , 30 ] in particle production with @xmath less than unity at
low @xmath and above unity at @xmath GeV/c.

### 4.3 @xmath ratio in d+Au and p+p collisions at middle
pseudo-rapidity

Figure 4.3 depicts @xmath , the ratio of @xmath over inclusive charged
hadrons as a function of @xmath in d+Au and p+p minimum-bias collisions
at @xmath GeV, and @xmath ratios in p+p and p+W minimum-bias collisions
at @xmath GeV [ 28 ] . Although the relative yields of particles and
anti-particles are very different at @xmath GeV due to the valence quark
effects from target and projectile, the Cronin effects are similar. The
systematic uncertainties on these ratios were estimated to be of the
order of 10% for @xmath GeV/c, decreasing to 3% at higher @xmath . At
RHIC energies, the anti-particle to particle ratios approach unity (
@xmath in d+Au minimum-bias collisions) and their nuclear modification
factors are similar. The difference between @xmath at @xmath GeV for
@xmath and @xmath can be obtained from the @xmath ratios in d+Au and p+p
collisions. Table 4.1 shows @xmath determined by averaging over the bins
within @xmath GeV/c. At lower energy, the @xmath parameter in the power
law dependence on target atomic weight @xmath of identified particle
production falls with @xmath [ 28 ] . From the ratios of @xmath between
@xmath and @xmath , we may further derive the @xmath for @xmath GeV/c to
be @xmath (stat) @xmath (syst) under the assumptions that @xmath and
that @xmath and @xmath are between 0.1 and 0.4 in p+p collisions. This
result is significantly smaller than the value @xmath in the same @xmath
range found at lower energies [ 28 ] .

Also shown is @xmath ratio from the Au+Au minimum-bias collisions at
@xmath GeV [ 18 ] . The @xmath ratio from minimum-bias Au+Au collisions
[ 18 ] at a similar energy is about a factor of 2 higher than that in
d+Au and p+p collisions for @xmath GeV/c. This enhancement is most
likely due to final-state effects in Au+Au collisions [ 9 , 24 , 19 , 20
, 22 , 23 ] . The ratios show little centrality dependence in d+Au
collisions, as shown in Table 4.1 and Figure 4.4 . For @xmath GeV/c, the
ratio in @xmath collisions at @xmath TeV [ 80 ] is very similar to those
in d+Au and p+p collisions at @xmath GeV.

### 4.4 @xmath, @xmath and anti-particle to particle ratios

Figure 4.5 shows the @xmath , @xmath and @xmath ratios as a function of
@xmath in d+Au and p+p minimum-bias collisions. It shows the
anti-particle to particle ratios are flat with @xmath . The zero order
polynominal function was used to fit the data and get the anti-particle
to particle ratios. The results are list in Table 4.2 . In centrality
selected d+Au collisions, the anti-particle to particle ratios are also
flat with @xmath and show little centrality dependence. The results are
also shown in the Table 4.2 .

The @xmath and @xmath ratios are shown in Figure 4.6 and Figure 4.7
individually. From the plots, the @xmath ratios increase with @xmath in
both d+Au and p+p collisions and the increasing trend is the same within
our errors. The @xmath ratios increase with @xmath in both d+Au and p+p
collisions and the increasing in d+Au collisions is faster than that in
p+p collisions. The trends of the @xmath and @xmath as a function of
@xmath show little centrality dependence in d+Au collisions.

### 4.5 @xmath, @xmath, and model fits

The spectra in minimum-bias and centrality selected d+Au collisions and
also in p+p collisions are shown in Figure 4.8 , Figure 4.9 and Figure
4.10 . The spectra show little centrality dependence for each particle
in d+Au collisions but harder than those in p+p collisions. The power
law function was used to fit the spectra and get the @xmath and @xmath .
The power law fit function is:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

Where the parameter @xmath is a constant value proportional to the
mid-rapidity yield @xmath , the parameter @xmath is the order of the
power law and @xmath is the mean value of the transverse momentum which
is extracted from the fit. Figure 4.11 shows power law fit to the
spectra of minimum-bias d+Au and p+p collisions. Figure 4.12 shows power
law fit to the spectra of 3 centrality selected d+Au collisions. The
power law fit results are listed in Table 4.4 and Table 4.3
individually. The thermal model [ 34 ] was also used to fit the spectra.
The final @xmath and @xmath are shown in Table 4.6 and Table 4.5
respectively, which were obtained by averaging the results from the
power law fit and thermal fit. Half of the differences in them are taken
as the systematic errors due to the extrapolation to low @xmath region.
The errors in this table include the systematic uncertainties and
statistical errors.

### 4.6 System comparison

Figure 4.13 shows the @xmath of @xmath , @xmath and @xmath as a function
of charged particle multiplicity at mid-rapidity. From p+p to d+Au
collisions, the @xmath increase with charged particle multiplicity
smoothly. We observed the @xmath in 0%-20% d+Au collisions are larger
than those in peripheral Au+Au collisions.

The @xmath and @xmath as a function of charged particle multiplicity at
mid-rapidity are shown in Figure 4.14 . The @xmath and @xmath ratios
were derived by taking the ratios of the dN/dy of @xmath or @xmath over
the dN/dy of @xmath in table 4.6 . These ratios increase with charged
particle multiplicity from p+p, d+Au to Au+Au collisions smoothly. The
kinetic freeze out temperature @xmath and flow velocity @xmath from
thermal fit as a function of charged particle multiplicity are shown in
Figure 4.15 . We can see the @xmath is flat from p+p to d+Au and then
decreases from d+Au to Au+Au collisions and the @xmath increases from
p+p, d+Au to Au+Au collisions.

## Chapter 5 Discussion

### 5.1 Cronin effect

The identified particle spectra in d+Au and p+p collisions not only
provide the reference for those in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV, but also
provide a chance to see the mechanism of the Cronin effect itself
clearly. Cronin effect was observed 30 years ago [ 28 ] . It is the
enhancement of particle production at high @xmath . The enhancement was
explained by initial multiple parton scattering. Also the recent
experimental results of Cronin effect on inclusive charged hadron are
consistent with the predictions based on initial multiple parton
scattering [ 30 ] . It suggests the suppression at intermediate @xmath
in Au+Au collisions is due to final state effects. However, the initial
multiple parton scattering with the independent fragmentation function
will result in the same Cronin effect for @xmath and for pions, while
experimentally the Cronin effect for @xmath is larger than that for
@xmath . That’s to say the initial multiple scattering with the
independent fragmentation function can’t account for the Cronin effect
observed. Maybe in the initial multiple parton scattering, the
broadening for gluon and for quark/antiquark are not the same [ 88 ] .
Or maybe the fragmentation processes in p+A collisions are not the same
as those in p+p collisions [ 89 ] . Whether the Cronin effect is initial
state effect or final state effect will be discussed below.

#### 5.1.1 Model comparison: initial state effect?

The initial multiple parton scattering model predicts that the Cronin
effect on deuteron beam outgoing side is larger than that on Au beam
outgoing side since the deuteron traverses a much larger nucleus [ 87 ]
. Figure 5.1 (left) shows the predictions for the Cronin effect at
different rapidity range. The different curves correspond to the
prediction results from different shadowings. The @xmath is on the
deuteron beam outgoing side. The @xmath is on the Au beam outgoing side.
The @xmath is at mid-rapidity. We can see that the @xmath on deuteron
beam side ( @xmath ) increases faster than that on Au beam side ( @xmath
). If we take the ratio of @xmath on Au beam side over @xmath on
deuteron beam side, it will result in a minimum value at @xmath GeV/c,
as shown in the curves on the right plot of Figure 5.1 . The solid
symbol on the right plot of Figure 5.1 represents the data points [ 90 ]
, which is the ratio of @xmath on Au beam side at @xmath over @xmath on
deuteron beam side at @xmath . We observe the @xmath asymmetry from
experiment reaches a maximum value firstly and then decreases. This is
different from the predictions. That means, the model based on initial
multiple parton scattering only, can’t reproduce the experimental
results. Recently, Qiu and Vitev have come up with the idea of coherent
multiple scattering and applied it to the RHIC experiments [ 91 ] . In
this picture, the hard probe may interact coherently with many low x
parton inside different nucleons inside the nucleus. As a result, this
process will lead to the suppression of the total cross section. This
coherent effect will play an important role in p+A collisions at forward
rapidity. In the deuteron outgoing beam direction, the coherent effect
is non-negligible since the Au nucleus is big while on the Au side, the
coherent effect is not big since the deuteron is of a small size. This
will result in bigger suppression on the deuteron side than on the Au
side. It may qualitatively reproduce the data. This coherent multiple
scattering is a final-state effect.

As we all known, in Au+Au collisions, the suppression at intermediate
@xmath can be reproduced by the initial multiple scattering and jet
quenching qualitatively [ 8 , 9 ] . However, the model based on the
initial multiple scattering, jet quenching and independent fragmentation
will result in the same suppression for baryons and mesons at
intermediate @xmath in Au+Au collisions. Experimentally @xmath for
baryons are larger than @xmath for mesons at intermediate @xmath . This
difference can be reproduced by coalescence or recombination models [ 21
, 22 , 23 ] . Recently the recombination model [ 92 ] has been applied
to d+Au system to see whether it can reproduce the Cronin effect or not.

With the help of Prof. C.B. Yang [ 93 ] , I also compare our pion and
proton spectra in d+Au collisions with the recombination model [ 92 ] .
In the following the recombination model [ 92 ] will be discussed and
the comparison between the data and the model will be presented in
detail.

#### 5.1.2 Model comparison: recombination

The inclusive distribution for the production of pions can be written in
the recombination model [ 92 ] , when mass effects are negligible, in
the invariant form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the joint distribution of a @xmath and @xmath at @xmath
and @xmath , and @xmath is the recombination function for forming a pion
at @xmath : @xmath . @xmath depends on the colliding hadron/nuclei. In
general, @xmath has four contributing components represented
schematically by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath denotes thermal distribution and @xmath shower
distribution. @xmath signifies two shower partons in the same
hard-parton jet, while @xmath stands for two shower partons from two
nearby jets [ 92 ] .

For @xmath collisions it may not be appropriate to refer to any partons
as thermal in the sense of a hot plasma as in heavy-ion collisions. Here
in d+Au collisions, the symbol @xmath represents the soft parton
distribution at low @xmath . At low @xmath the observed pion
distribution is exponential; we identify it with the contribution of the
@xmath term [ 92 ] .

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the inverse slope. We shall determine @xmath and @xmath
by fitting the d+Au data at low @xmath . The pion spectra for different
centralities can be calculated from thermal-thermal ( @xmath ),
thermal-shower ( @xmath ) and shower-shower ( @xmath ) contributions by
using parameters @xmath and @xmath : @xmath , where C is determined by
fitting the d+Au data at @xmath GeV/c, and @xmath is the number of
binary collisions. The data points of @xmath and @xmath are from Prof.
C.B. Yang [ 93 ] . The @xmath values for minimum-bias, 0-20%, 20-40% and
40- @xmath 100% d+Au collisions are 8.85, 13.08, 10.96 and 6.84
individually. The @xmath value of 0.21 GeV is used in the low @xmath
fit. Figure 5.2 shows the @xmath spectra in d+Au collisions as well as
those from recombination model. This figure shows that the recombination
model can reproduce the spectra of pion in minimum-bias and centrality
selected d+Au collisions.

The invariant inclusive distribution for proton formation at midrapidity
in the recombination model [ 92 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where all momentum variables @xmath and @xmath are transverse momenta,
and @xmath denotes the energy of the proton. @xmath is the joint
distribution of @xmath and @xmath quarks at @xmath and @xmath ,
respectively. @xmath is the recombination function for a proton with
momentum @xmath . We write schematically

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where all the shower partons @xmath are from one hard parton jet. Shower
partons from different jets are ignored here for RHIC energies. In d+Au
collisions, @xmath denotes the soft partons that are not associated with
the shower components of a hard parton. The @xmath term is regarded as
the fragmentation of a hard parton into a proton. The @xmath term comes
entirely from the soft partons, while @xmath and @xmath accounts for the
interplay between the soft and shower partons. The soft contribution to
the proton spectrum arising from @xmath recombination is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

. Where @xmath and @xmath are determined by fitting the proton spectra
at low @xmath , the @xmath is equal to 1.75, @xmath is equal to 1.05,
@xmath is the beta function [ 92 ] . For the invariant yield of proton,
there are 4 different contributions: soft-soft-soft ( @xmath ),
soft-soft-shower ( @xmath ), soft-shower-shower ( @xmath ), and
shower-shower-shower ( @xmath ). The total contributions are @xmath ,
where @xmath is determined by fitting the d+Au data at @xmath GeV/c, and
@xmath is the number of binary collisions. The data points of @xmath and
@xmath are from Prof. C.B. Yang [ 93 ] . The @xmath values for
minimum-bias, 0-20%, 20-40% and 40- @xmath 100% d+Au collisions are
9.67, 12.34, 10.92 and 7.91 individually. The @xmath value of 0.21 GeV
is used in the low @xmath fit. Figure 5.3 shows the proton spectra in
d+Au collisions as well as those from recombination model. This figure
shows that the recombination model can reproduce the spectra of proton
in minimum-bias and centrality selected d+Au collisions. From the
comparison between our data and the calculation results from the
recombination model, we know that the recombination model actually can
reproduce both the proton and pion spectra in d+Au collisions, while as
we have mentioned above, the initial multiple parton scattering model [
30 ] with independent fragmentation can’t reproduce the difference of
Cronin effect between proton and pion. Besides, the initial multiple
parton scattering model with independent fragmentation can’t reproduce
the @xmath asymmetry of the Cronin effect. In the recombination model [
92 ] , the number of such soft partons on the Au outgoing side is larger
than that on the deuteron outgoing side. This will result in the Cronin
effect on the Au side larger than that on the deuteron side [ 92 ] .
Qualitatively the recombination model can reproduce the @xmath asymmetry
of the Cronin effect. As we know, the recombination model is a
final-state effect model. These all seem to indicate that the Cronin
effect is not initial-state effect only. The final-state effect plays an
important role too. To directly confirm the Cronin effect is initial or
final state effect, it’s necessary for us to compare the Cronin effect
of Drell-Yan process with those of pion, kaon and proton. I will come to
this later.

#### 5.1.3 Integral yield @xmath: shadowing effect?

The initial multiple elastic scattering only changes the @xmath
distribution while the total cross section should not change. Thus we
can look at the integral yield @xmath @xmath , which are measured
through comparison to the integral yield @xmath in p+p collisions,
scaled by the number of binary collisions @xmath . Figure 5.4 shows that
integral yield @xmath of pion, kaon and proton as a function of @xmath
in minimum-bias and centrality selected d+Au collisions at mid-rapidity.
The integral yield @xmath of pion and kaon are less than 1 while that of
proton is close to 1. This may be the indication of shadowing effect at
200 GeV. The integral yield @xmath for proton is larger than that for
kaon and a little bit more larger than that for pion. This may be the
indication that the shadowing effect is mass dependent at 200 GeV.

#### 5.1.4 Initial or final state effect: Drell-Yan process

In order to see the Cronin effect is initial or final state effect, we
may look into the Drell-Yan process since there is little final state
effect in Drell-Yan process. If there is no enhancement at high @xmath
for Drell-Yan process, the enhancement for @xmath is due to final-state
effect. Figure 5.5 shows the integral yield Cronin ratio as a function
of atomic weight at p-A fixed target experiment [ 95 ] . The proton
incident energy is 800 GeV. We can see there is no enhancement for
Drell-Yan process. However, this is the total cross section while what
we want to compare is Cronin ratio as a function of @xmath . It will be
better if we have the @xmath dependence of Cronin ratio of Drell-Yan
process. However, at the same @xmath range with the same proton incident
energy, the Cronin ratio of Drell-Yan is not available in p+A
collisions. It’s hard to compare the Cronin ratio of Drell-Yan process
with those of @xmath .

### 5.2 Baryon excess in Au+Au collisions

Now let’s come to another important physics from d+Au collisions. We
know that the @xmath ratio from minimum-bias Au+Au collisions [ 18 ] at
a similar energy is about a factor of 2 higher than that in d+Au and p+p
collisions for @xmath GeV/c. This enhancement is most likely due to
final-state effects in Au+Au collisions. There are many models trying to
explain this baryon excess in Au+Au collisions [ 9 , 24 , 19 , 20 , 22 ,
23 ] . In the following baryon production mechanism will be discussed.

#### 5.2.1 @xmath ratio vs @xmath

In 200 GeV Au+Au collisions, @xmath ratio was observed to be flat with
@xmath till intermediate @xmath range [ 14 ] , as shown in Figure 5.6 .
The baryon junction model [ 24 ] tried to explain it by using junction
anti-junction production with jet quenching, on the basis of pQCD
calculation [ 24 ] where the @xmath ratio decreases with @xmath in p+p
collisions. The curve from pQCD calculation [ 24 ] is also shown in
Figure 5.6 . However, @xmath ratios in d+Au and p+p collisions in our
data show to be flat with @xmath within errors. Anyway, the precise
measurement with more statistics in p+p and d+Au collisions is needed to
address this issue.

#### 5.2.2 Baryon production at RHIC: multi-gluon dynamics?

Let’s compare the @xmath ratio in p+p, d+Au and Au+Au collisions at RHIC
energy 200 GeV with the ratio in @xmath collisions at ARGUS [ 96 ] .
Using the ARGUS detector at the @xmath storage ring DORIS II, the
inclusive production of pion, kaon and proton in multihadron events at
9.98 GeV and in direct decays of the @xmath meson were investigated [ 96
] . Multihadron final states in @xmath annihilation are produced via
quark and antiquark fragmentation, and those from direct @xmath decays
originate from the hadronization of three gluons [ 96 ] . Figure 5.7
shows the @xmath ratio in 200 GeV p+p collisions together with the ratio
in @xmath collisions at ARGUS [ 96 ] . The plot shows that the @xmath
ratio from three gluon hadronization is a factor of 3 higher than that
from quark and antiquark fragmentation at ARGUS. Our data from 200 GeV
p+p collisions is close to @xmath ratio from 3 gluon hadronization. This
may be the indication that in the heavy ion collisions at RHIC energy,
multi-gluon hadronization plays an important role for the particle
production.

## Chapter 6 Conclusion and Outlook

### 6.1 Conclusion

In summary, we have reported the identified particle spectra of pions,
kaons, protons and anti-protons at mid-rapidity from 200 GeV
minimum-bias, centrality selected d+Au collisions and NSD p+p
collisions. The time-of-flight detector, based on novel multi-gap
resistive plate chamber technology, was used for particle
identification. This is the first time that MRPC detector was installed
to take data as a time-of-flight detector in the collider experiment.
The calibration method was set up in the STAR experiment for the first
time and has been applied to the data taken later successfully. The
intrinsic timing resolution of the MRPC was 85 ps after the calibration.
In 2003 run, the pion/kaon can be separated up to transverse momentum
1.6 GeV/c while proton can be identified up to 3.0 GeV/c.

The spectra of @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath in d+Au and p+p
collisions provide an important reference for those in Au+Au collisions.
The initial state in d+Au collisions is similar to that in Au+Au
collisions, and, it’s believed that the quark-gluon plasma doesn’t exist
in d+Au collisions. These results from d+Au collisions are very
important for us to judge whether the quark-gluon plasma exists in Au+Au
collisions or not and to understand the property of the dense matter
created in Au+Au collisions. We observe that the spectra of @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath are considerably harder in d+Au than those in
p+p collisions. In @xmath GeV d+Au collisions, the @xmath of protons
rise faster than @xmath of pions and kaons. The @xmath of proton is
larger than 1 at intermediate @xmath while the proton production follows
binary scaling at the same @xmath range in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions.
These results further prove that the suppression observed in Au+Au
collisions at intermediate and high @xmath is due to final state
interactions in a dense and dissipative medium produced during the
collision and not due to the initial state wave function of the Au
nucleus. Additionally, the particle-species dependence of the Cronin
effect is found to be significantly smaller than that from lower energy
p+A collisions. In @xmath GeV d+Au collisions, the ratio of the nuclear
modification factor @xmath between @xmath and charged hadrons ( @xmath )
in the @xmath range @xmath GeV/c was measured to be @xmath (stat) @xmath
(syst) in minimum-bias collisions. Both the @xmath values and @xmath
ratios show little centrality dependence, in contrast to previous
measurements in Au+Au collisions at @xmath = 130 and 200 GeV. The ratios
of protons over charged hadrons in d+Au and p+p collisions are found to
be about a factor of 2 lower than that from Au+Au collisions, indicating
that the relative baryon enhancement observed in heavy ion collisions at
RHIC is due to the final state effects in Au+Au collisions.

The identified particle spectra in d+Au and p+p collisions not only
provide the reference for those in Au+Au collisions, but also provide a
chance to see the mechanism of the Cronin effect itself clearly. Usually
the Cronin effect has been explained to be the initial state effect only
since 1970s [ 30 ] . However, we compare our pion and proton spectra in
minimum-bias and centrality-selected d+Au collisions with the
recombination model [ 92 ] . The recombination model can reproduce both
the pion spectra and proton spectra. This recombination model is built
on the hadronization process, which is a final-state effect, while the
initial multiple parton scattering model [ 30 ] can’t reproduce the
difference of the Cronin effect between pions and protons. From these
comparisons, we conclude that the Cronin effect in @xmath GeV d+Au
collisions is not the initial state effect only, and that final state
effect plays an important role.

The integral yield @xmath and @xmath in p+p and d+Au collisions were
estimated from the power law fit and thermal model fit. The integral
yield @xmath of @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are observed to be
smaller than 1 while those of @xmath and @xmath are close to 1. The
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath ratios as a function of @xmath are observed
to be flat with @xmath within the errors in d+Au and p+p minimum-bias
collisions and show little centrality dependence in d+Au collisions. The
integral yield ratios of @xmath and @xmath as a function of @xmath were
also presented in p+p and d+Au collisions.

### 6.2 Outlook

For the outlook, I will discuss whether the Cronin effect is mass
dependent or baryon/meson dependent at 200 GeV. What other physics topic
have we done from MRPC-TOFr in d+Au and p+p collisions in 2003 run? If
we have the full time-of-flight (Full-TOF) coverage, what can we do?
Also I will discuss a little bit about the low energy 63 GeV Au+Au run.

#### 6.2.1 Cronin effect at 200 GeV: Mass dependent or baryon/meson
dependent?

We know that recombination model can reproduce the spectra of pions and
protons in d+Au collisions. Also the @xmath of identified particles in
Au+Au collisions suggest that the degree of suppression depends on
particle species(baryon/meson) at intermediate @xmath . Does the Cronin
effect in 200 GeV d+Au collisions depend on the particle species
(baryon/meson) or depend on the particle mass? From our data, it shows
the Cronin effect for proton is bigger than those for pion and kaon. And
the Cronin effect of pion shows little difference from that of kaon at
@xmath GeV/c. In order to see the Cronin effect is baryon/meson
dependent or mass dependent, we can compare the Cronin effect of proton
with those of @xmath and @xmath since the mass of @xmath and @xmath are
close to that of proton while @xmath and @xmath are mesons and proton is
a baryon. The preliminary results show that the Cronin effect of @xmath
and @xmath [ 97 ] are similar to that of pion and different from that of
proton. However, the final results from @xmath and @xmath are needed to
confirm this issue.

#### 6.2.2 Electron PID from MRPC-TOFr

The production and spectra of hadrons with heavy flavor are sensitive to
initial conditions and the later stage dynamical evolution in high
energy nuclear collisions, and may be less affected by the
non-perturbative complication in theoretical calculations [ 100 ] .
Charm production has been proposed as a sensitive measurement of parton
distribution function in nucleon and the nuclear shadowing effect by
systematically studying p+p, and p+A collisions [ 101 ] . The relatively
reduced energy loss of heavy quark traversing a quark-gluon plasma will
help us distinguish the medium in which the jet loses its energy [ 102 ]
. A possible enhancement of charmonia ( @xmath ) production can be
present at RHIC energies [ 103 ] due to the coalescence of the copiously
produced charm quarks [ 99 ] .

The recent STAR results on the absolute open charm cross section
measurements from direct charmed hadron @xmath reconstruction [ 81 ] in
d+Au collisions and electrons from charm semileptonic decay in both p+p
and d+Au collisions at 200 GeV were presented [ 99 ] . Based on the
capability of hadron identification [ 98 ] from the MRPC-TOFr tray in
2003, electrons could be identified at low momentum ( @xmath GeV/c) by
the combination of velocity ( @xmath ) from TOFr [ 39 ] and the particle
ionization energy loss ( @xmath ) from TPC [ 38 ] . Figure 6.1 shows
that the electrons are clearly identified as a separate band in the
@xmath versus momentum ( @xmath ) with a selection on @xmath at @xmath
in d+Au collisions. At higher @xmath (2–4 GeV/c), negative electrons
were also identified directly by TPC since hadrons have lower @xmath due
to the relativisitic rise of electron @xmath . Based on the clear
electron identification, the open-charm-decayed electron spectra was
derived [ 99 ] . Combined with @xmath measurement from TPC, the total
charm cross section was obtained [ 99 ] in d+Au collisions.

#### 6.2.3 Full-TOF Physics

Based on the hadron PID and electron PID of MRPC-TOFr in 2003, we can
imagine how many physics we can do if we have full time-of-flight
coverage based on MRPC technology. The proposal [ 74 ] for large area
time-of-flight system for STAR has been proposed. Since the pion/kaon
can be separated up to transverse momentum 1.6 GeV/c and proton can be
identified up to 3.0 GeV/c from time-of-flight system. The resonance
spectra measured from hadronic decay will be extended to much higher
@xmath . The direct open charm spectra from its hadronic decay channel
will reach higher @xmath with much more precise measurement. Since the
electron can be clearly identified up to transverse momentum 3 @xmath 4
GeV/c by the combination of velocity ( @xmath ) from TOFr [ 39 ] and the
particle ionization energy loss ( @xmath ) from TPC [ 38 ] , the
electron spectra from charm-semi-leptonic decay will be measured
precisely. As we know that the measurement of the di-leptonic decays of
vector mesons are very difficult since the branch ratios are too small
and it’s really hard to subtract the background. But with TOF upgrading
together with the SVT and micro-vertex detector upgrading, the
di-leptonic decays of vector mesons will be measured much more easily,
which will bring the direct information of QGP since the electron is a
lepton and the cross section of interaction between electrons and
hadrons is little. Thus we can see directly the property of quark-gluon
plasma such as the temperature and the chiral symmetry restoration. This
will be the most interesting and meaningful thing for the QGP search [
94 ] . Besides, there are many other physics topics [ 74 ] such as
identified particle correlation and fluctuation, particle composition of
jet fragmentation, and anti-nuclei etc.

#### 6.2.4 63 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC

The bulk properties such as elliptic flow @xmath and particle production
show smooth trend from AGS, SPS to RHIC energy. One energy point @xmath
GeV, which is between SPS and full RHIC energy, was selected since high
quality charged-particle and @xmath inclusive spectra have been measured
in p+p collisions at 63 GeV at Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) and will
serve as the reference spectra for computing the nuclear modification
factor for Au+Au collisions measured at the same energy. The @xmath and
particle production at 63 GeV will be studied at RHIC. Besides, the
nuclear modification factor as a function of @xmath will also be studied
in this collision system in which the hard scattering component has been
significantly reduced. The results from 63 GeV Au+Au collisions will be
helpful for us to understand the property of dense medium created in 200
GeV Au+Au collisions.

This appendix is based on the procedure of the MRPC production in USTC.
I will introduce the material preparations and then the chamber
installation.

### b.1 Preparations

#### b.1.1 Glass

(1) Check the glass very carefully by eye. The glass with scrapes is not
accepted. (2) Measure the size of the glass with the digital vernier
caliper. The errors of the length and width are required to be within
0.1 mm. Measure the thickness in several different places. The precision
of the thickness is required to be 0.01 mm for each glass. (3) Use the
micrometer to measure the flatness, which is required to be less than
0.01 mm. Use the mirror and observe the stripes of interference. (4)
Grind the edge and the corner of the glass, and clean it. The size of
outer glass is @xmath @xmath and the size of inner glass is @xmath
@xmath .

#### b.1.2 Graphite Layer

(1) Stick the layer in the middle of the outer glass. Squeeze the air
out. (2) Stick a small copper tape, which is for high voltage (HV)
applying, on to the graphite layer, which is in the middle of the long
side, and 0 @xmath 0.5 mm away from the edge of the glass. The size of
the graphite layer is @xmath @xmath . The size of the copper tape (the
rectangle with the round angle) is @xmath @xmath .

#### b.1.3 Mylar layer

Cut the mylar layer, and see if there is any tiny holes or scrapes. If
yes, don’t use it. The size of mylar is @xmath @xmath .

#### b.1.4 Honeycomb board

Measure the size and flatness. The error of the length and width is
required to be within 0.2 mm, the error of the thickness is required to
be within 0.05 mm. The flatness is required to be within 0.1 mm. The
size of honeycomb board is @xmath @xmath .

#### b.1.5 The printed circuit board (PCB)

(1) Check the surface of the metal which is used as read-out strips
carefully, and see the position of the HV-holes is right or not. Check
the size of the metal holes, whose diameters are required to be larger
than 0.9 mm. (2) Use double side tape to stick the PCB board with the
Mylar. The size of the double side tape is the same as the PCB board.
The length of the mylar is 1 mm longer than that of the PCB board. (3)
Use sealing ion to open a @xmath 3 mm hole, the center of the hole is in
the middle of the HV holes. The size of PCB is @xmath @xmath . The size
of metal holes are @xmath 1 mm.

#### b.1.6 Lucite cylinder

Use digital vernier caliper to measure the length of the Lucite
cylinder. Clean it and stick a double side tape on one side. The size is
@xmath 3 mm and @xmath mm.

#### b.1.7 Other stuff

Besides, we also need pins, fish line and little plastic cannula. The
size of the pin is 2-2.1 cm long. The fish line is @xmath 0.22 mm. The
plastic cannula is @xmath 1 mm. One kind of the cannula is 7 mm long,
and the other is 5.6 mm long. Table B.1 lists the main materials for 1
MRPC.

### b.2 Installation

#### b.2.1 The outer glass and mylar and PCB

(1) stick the outer glass on to the center of the mylar. (2) Use the
sealing ion to connect the HV conductive line with the copper tape.
Apply the HV to measure the noise rate and dark current. (3) Between the
mylar and outer glass edge, on each side, use silica gel to seal.
Attention: keep the surface clean and smooth. Attention: If one side is
done, wait till the silica gel becomes solid. (4) Stick pins. Seal the
pins which are used for the fish line coiling, into the metal holes of
the PCB board. (5) Use the inner glass to fix on the position of Lucite
cylinders, and keep them away from the pins for fish line. Then stick
the 8 @xmath 10 Lucite cylinders onto the outer glass.

#### b.2.2 Inner glass and fish-line coiling

(1) Pre-install. Don’t use fish-line. Pay attention to adjust the
position of the pins. (2) This is now the real installation and fish
line coiling. Clean the outer glass and inner glass carefully, coil a
loop of fish line, add a piece of glass, then coil another loop of fish
line, add another piece of glass, and so on and so forth. Attention:
clean the fish line before it coils, and blow the surface of glass to
protect it from the dirt with nitrogen jet. (3) Another time for
pre-installation. Pay attention to the position of the upper and lower
electrodes and adjust the position of pins. (4) Paste 3140 RTV coating
onto the surface of Lucite cylinders. (5) Connect the two electrodes.
Make sure all the pins connect right into the metal holes. Then lay the
whole flat, and put on a block which is 4 kilogram weight. (6) After 2
hours, stick the honeycomb. (7) Measure the thickness of the whole. Make
sure the precision is within 0.05 mm. (8) Connect the conductive-line
for the read-out strips, and then put the whole into a bag. Attention:
the conductive-line should not be broken.
