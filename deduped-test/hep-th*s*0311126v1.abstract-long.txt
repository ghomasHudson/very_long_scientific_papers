This thesis considers one and two dimensional supersymmetric nonlinear
sigma models. First there is a discussion of the geometries of one and
two dimensional sigma models, with rigid supersymmetry.

For the one-dimensional case, the supersymmetry is promoted to a local
one and the required gauge fields are introduced. The most general
Lagrangian, including these gauge fields, is found. The constraints of
the system are analysed, and its Dirac quantisation is investigated.

In the next chapter we introduce equivariant cohomology which is used
later in the thesis.

Then actions are constructed for (p,0)- and (p,1)- supersymmetric,
@xmath , two-dimensional gauge theories coupled to non-linear sigma
model matter with a Wess-Zumino term.

The scalar potential for a large class of these models is derived. It is
then shown that the Euclidean actions of the (2,0) and
(4,0)-supersymmetric models without Wess-Zumino terms are bounded by
topological charges which involve the equivariant extensions of the
KÃ¤hler forms of the sigma model target spaces evaluated on the
two-dimensional spacetime.

Similar bounds for Euclidean actions of appropriate gauge theories
coupled to non-linear sigma model matter in higher spacetime dimensions
are given which now involve the equivariant extensions of the Kahler
forms of the sigma model target spaces and the second Chern character of
gauge fields. It is found that the BPS configurations are
generalisations of abelian and non-abelian vortices.
