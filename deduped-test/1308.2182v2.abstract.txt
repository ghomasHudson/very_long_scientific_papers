In this thesis, I show my Ph.D. work on event-by-event hydrodynamic
simulations for relativistic heavy-ion collision. I show that event-by-event
hydrodynamic simulations have become an indispensable tool for studying
relativistic heavy-ion collisions and how it can be used to explain many
phenomena. Different chapters focus on different topics; it mainly includes:
Chap 2: comparison between single-shot hydrodynamics event-by-event
hydrodynamic simulations. Chap 3: using the elliptic and triangular flow data
measured by the ALICE collaboration at the LHC to constrain initial condition
models. Chap 4: study on correlations between event-plane angles. Chap 5: how
resonance decay calculation can be speed up by a factor of 10. Chap 6: study on
fluctuations of event planes angle {\Psi}n(pT) and their theoretical and
experimental consequences. Chap 7: sampling particles according to the
Cooper-Frye formula.
