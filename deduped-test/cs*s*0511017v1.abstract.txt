In this thesis we introduce quantum refereed games, which are quantum
interactive proof systems with two competing provers. We focus on a restriction
of this model that we call "short quantum games" and we prove an upper bound
and a lower bound on the expressive power of these games.
  For the lower bound, we prove that every language having an ordinary quantum
interactive proof system also has a short quantum game. An important part of
this proof is the establishment of a quantum measurement that reliably
distinguishes between quantum states chosen from disjoint convex sets.
  For the upper bound, we show that certain types of quantum refereed games,
including short quantum games, are decidable in deterministic exponential time
by supplying a separation oracle for use with the ellipsoid method for convex
feasibility.
