In this thesis the generally covariant locality principle for bosonic free
fields has been thoroughly analyzed devoting particular attention to the case
of spin 1 fields on curved spacetimes (Proca and Maxwell fields). This has been
obtained in two steps: In the first place the preliminary study of the
corresponding field equations led to the construction of a symplectic space of
solutions describing the classical theories of the considered fields. Secondly
the locally covariant quantum theory of the field under consideration has been
obtained through the assignment of the Weyl algebra associated to the
symplectic space describing the classical theory. The last part of the thesis
has been devoted to the proof of the relative Cauchy evolution for both the
Proca field and the Maxwell field.
