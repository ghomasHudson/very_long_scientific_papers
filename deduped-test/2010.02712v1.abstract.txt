We set up a general framework to compute the exact multiplicity with which
certain automorphic representations appear in both the cuspidal and Eisenstein
cohomology of locally symmetric spaces. We apply this machinery to Eisenstein
series on $GSp_4$ and split $G_2$. In the case of $G_2$, we will also obtain
new information about the archimedean components of certain CAP representations
using Arthur's conjectures.
