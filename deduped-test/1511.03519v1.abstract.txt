Michael HARRIS defined the arithmetic automorphic periods for certain
cuspidal representations of $GL_{n}$ over quadratic imaginary fields in his
Crelle paper 1997. He also showed that critical values of automorphic
L-functions for $GL_{n}\times GL_{1}$ can be interpreted in terms of these
arithmetic automorphic periods. In the thesis, we generalize his results in two
ways. Firstly, the arithmetic automorphic periods have been defined over
general CM fields. We also prove that these periods factorize as products of
local periods over infinity places. Secondly, we show that critical values of
automorphic $L$ functions for $GL_{n}\times GL_{n'}$ can be interpreted in
terms of these automorphic periods in many situations. Consequently we show
that the automorphic periods are functorial for automorphic induction and
cyclic base change. We also define certain motivic periods if the motive is
restricted from a CM field to the field of rational numbers. We can calculate
Deligne's period for tensor product of two such motives. We see directly that
our automorphic results are compatible with Deligne's conjecture for motives.
