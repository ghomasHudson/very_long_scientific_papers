In this Thesis we develop a novel direction in the theory of nano-objects,
i.e., structures of nanometer size in a tunnel contact with macroscopic
electron reservoirs (metallic leads). In particular we elucidate the Kondo
effect predicted in tunneling through triple quantum dots and sandwich-type
molecules adsorbed on metallic substrate, which are referred to as trimers. The
unusual dynamical symmetry of nano-objects is one of the most intriguing
problems, which arise in the theory of these systems. We demonstrate that
trimers possess dynamical symmetries whose realization in Kondo tunneling is
experimentally tangible. Such experimental tuning of dynamical symmetries is
not possible in conventional Kondo scattering. We develop the general approach
to the problem of dynamical symmetries in Kondo tunneling through nano-objects
and illustrate it by numerous examples of trimers in various configurations, in
parallel, in series and in ring geometries.
