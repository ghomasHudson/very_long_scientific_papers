In this Thesis we will present a work at the boundary between Physics
and Biology. On the one hand we studied theoretically, on a newly
defined class of random networks, a constraint satisfaction problem
(CSP) devised to understand the capabilities of a metabolic network. On
the other hand we showed that it is possible to apply the same
techniques in real networks by obtaining preliminary results on the real
metabolic network of E.Coli. We will thus show in this Thesis that it is
possible to analyze biological problems on metabolic networks both
theoretically and practically by computer simulations of a simplified
model.
