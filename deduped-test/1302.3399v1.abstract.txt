This is a PhD dissertation on the latest numerical quantum estimation schemes
as of 2012, submitted to the National University of Singapore. The main content
of the thesis focuses on accessing quantum information with informationally
incomplete measurements to reconstruct quantum states of large quantum systems,
as well as to reduce the amount of resources to reconstruct quantum channels.
