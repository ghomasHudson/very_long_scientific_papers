In this thesis we study the flat model , the main buidling block for the
spinfoam approach to quantum gravity, with an emphasis on its
divergences . Besides a personal introduction to the problem of quantum
gravity, the manuscript consists in two part. In the first one, we
establish an exact powercounting formula for the bubble divergences of
the flat model, using tools from discrete gauge theory and twisted
cohomology. In the second one, we address the issue of spinfoam
continuum limit , both from the lattice field theory and the group field
theory perspectives. In particular, we put forward a new proof of the
Borel summability of the Boulatov-Freidel-Louapre model, with an
improved control over the large-spin scaling behaviour. We conclude with
an outlook of the renormalization program in spinfoam quantum gravity.
