In this thesis we consider ’t Hooft’s polygon model for 2+1D gravity. We
first recall the ADM formalism to write general relativity in
Hamiltonian form. With this background in mind, we give a detailed
review of the polygon model and its explicit evolution description in
the classical context.

Then we review some remarks in the literature about quantization of this
model and the discreteness of space-time. We discuss the problems
associated with this in the context of canonical quantization for some
explicit quantization schemes: the triangle inequalities conflict with
the Stone–Von Neumann uniqueness theorem when we use the canonical
variables. Also, the implementation of transitions, the constraints and
their algebra poses significant problems. We conclude that no rigorous
conclusions about the spectrum of space-time can be drawn without an
explicit quantization scheme.

Furthermore, we consider the Poisson structure of the constraints, which
are important when we try to quantize the model. We improve known
results and show that the full Poisson structure can be calculated
explicitly and that it closes on shell. An attempt is made to interpret
the gauge orbits generated by the constraints.
