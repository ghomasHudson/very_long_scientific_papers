This thesis is concerned with two topics in Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory:
improvement and the application of analytic techniques. On the topic of
improvement, we develop a direct method for improving lattice Hamiltonians for
gluons, in which linear combinations of gauge invariant lattice operators are
chosen to cancel the lowest order discretisation errors. On the topic of
analytic methods, we extend the techniques that have been used in 2+1
dimensional SU(2) variational calculations for many years, to the general case
of SU(N). For this purpose a number of group integrals are calculated in terms
of Toeplitz determinants. As generating functions these group integrals allow
the calculation of all matrix elements appearing in variational glueball mass
calculations in 2+1 dimensions. Making use of these analytic techniques,
glueball masses in various symmetry sectors are calculated with N as large as
25 allowing extrapolations to infinite N to be performed. We finish with a
feasibility study of applying analytic Hamiltonian techniques in 3+1
dimensional calculations.
