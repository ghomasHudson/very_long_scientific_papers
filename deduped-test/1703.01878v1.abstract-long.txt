Understanding the dynamical behavior of complex systems is of
exceptional relevance in everyday life, from biology to economy. In
order to describe the dynamical organization of complex systems,
existing methods require the knowledge of the network topology. By
contrast, in this thesis we develop a new method based on Information
Theory which does not require any topological knowledge. We introduce
the Dynamical Cluster Index to detect those groups of system elements
which have strong mutual interactions, named as Relevant Subsets. Among
them, we identify those which exchange most information with the rest of
the system, thus being the most influential for its dynamics. In order
to detect such Functional Dynamical Structures, we introduce another
information theoretic measure, called D-index. The experimental results
make us confident that our method can be effectively used to study both
artificial and natural complex systems.
