In this thesis we are interested in the problem of dark energy in cosmology.
In particular, we consider the possibility that this effect is due to an
infrared non-local modification of the theory of General Relativity. Inspired
by massive gravity, we construct non-local theories in which gravity may be
massive, but where the symmetry of diffeomorphisms is preserved. We focus on
the cosmology of these theories and confront them with observational
constraints. On a more theoretical level, we discuss some subtleties of
non-local field theory and address in a novel way the issue of stability. This
thesis is based on both published and original work.
