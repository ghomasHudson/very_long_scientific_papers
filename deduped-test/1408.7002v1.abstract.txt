In this thesis we develop a full characterization of abelian quantum
statistics on graphs. We explain how the number of anyon phases is related to
connectivity. For 2-connected graphs the independence of quantum statistics
with respect to the number of particles is proven. For non-planar 3-connected
graphs we identify bosons and fermions as the only possible statistics, whereas
for planar 3-connected graphs we show that one anyon phase exists. Our approach
also yields an alternative proof of the structure theorem for the first
homology group of n-particle graph configuration spaces. Finally, we determine
the topological gauge potentials for 2-connected graphs. Moreover we present an
alternative application of discrete Morse theory for two-particle graph
configuration spaces. In contrast to previous constructions, which are based on
discrete Morse vector fields, our approach is through Morse functions, which
have a nice physical interpretation as two-body potentials constructed from
one-body potentials. We also give a brief introduction to discrete Morse
theory.
