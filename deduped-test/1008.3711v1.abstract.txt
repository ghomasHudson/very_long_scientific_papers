This thesis is a study of various ways of measuring the size and complexity
of finitely generated modules over a Noetherian local ring. The classical
example is the multiplicity or degree. Here we investigate several variants of
the degree function: the homological Dilworth number, hdil, and the family of
cohomological degrees, such as the homological degree hdeg, and the extremal
cohomological degree, bdeg.
  Sally, Valla and others have established bounds for the number of generators
of ideals (or modules) in terms of multiplicities and other numerical data,
usually under the assumption that the ideal is Cohen-Macaulay. We use
cohomological degrees and the homological Dilworth number in place of the
classical degree to extend some of these results from the Cohen-Macaulay case
to the non-Cohen-Macaulay case. We give particular attention to the following
result: If M is Cohen-Macaulay, then the minimal number of generators is
bounded by the multiplicity of M, with equality if and only if the associated
graded ring has a linear resolution. We give extensions of this theorem to the
non-Cohen-Macaulay case. Our results are strongest for the extremal
cohomological degree, bdeg, and this provides an avenue for connecting
cohomological degrees with Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity.
