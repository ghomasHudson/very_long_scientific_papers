In this thesis, we perform an analysis on e+e- hadronic Z decays recorded in
1994 and 1995 by the L3 detector of LEP at center-of-mass energy corresponding
to the Z mass. The analysis is performed in parallel for all hadronic events
and for selected b-quark and light-quark events.
  The distribution of two variables, the charged-particle multiplicity and the
inclusive charged-particle momentum are measured, from which all the analysis
is carried out.
  From the measurement of the charged-particle multiplicity distribution, it is
possible to extract information concerning the dynamics of the interaction.
Using moments, one can obtain informations on particle correlation. We measure
the Hq moments of the charged-particle multiplicity distribution which give the
relative amount of genuine q-particle correlation order q. An oscillatory
pattern is observed when the H_q moments are plotted versus the order q.
Comparisons with different theoretical approaches are discussed.
