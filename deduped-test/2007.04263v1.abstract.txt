Social media analysis of disaster events is a critical task in crisis
informatics research. It involves analyzing social media data generated during
natural disasters, crisis events, or other mass convergence events. Due to the
large data sets generated during these events, large scale software
infrastructures need to be designed to analyze the data in a timely manner.
Creating such infrastructures bring the need to maintain them and this becomes
more difficult as these infrastructures grow larger and older. Maintenance
costs are high since there is a need for queries to be handled quickly which
require large amounts of computational resources to be available on demand 24
hours a day, seven days a week. In this thesis, I describe an alternative
approach to designing a software infrastructure for analyzing unstructured data
on the cloud while providing fast queries and with the reliability needed for
crisis informatics research. Additionally, I discuss a new approach for a more
reliable Twitter stream collection using container orchestrated systems. I
finally compare this new infrastructure with existing crisis informatics
software infrastructures and compare their reliability, scalability and
extensibility with my approach and my prototype.
