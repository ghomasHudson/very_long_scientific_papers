We investigate a proposal to address several outstanding shortcomings of the
perturbative Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. The appeal of this
proposal is that these features are a manifestation of the non-perturbative
sector of the SM, requiring no assumptions about new physics beyond presently
attainable experimental limits. In this thesis we apply non-perturbative
techniques to two complementary models: a toy 4-fermion model containing
explicit chiral symmetry-breaking terms and the quenched hypercharge gauge
interaction. Understanding of how fermion mass, generations and CP-violation
might arise is first investigated in the toy 4-fermion model. It is shown that
different scale-invariant 4-fermion operators are present for the three
subspaces of the full theory, enabling self-consistent introduction of three
fermion generations. The second part of the thesis is concerned with dynamical
fermion mass generation in the quenched hypercharge interaction. In particular
we follow the successful procedure developed for QED, developing a 1-loop
renormalisable vertex {\it ansatz} for solution of the fermion self-energy
Dyson-Schwinger equation. We find two mass "gaps", possibly corresponding to
two types of scalar 4-fermion pairing. These "gaps" cannot, however, be
interpreted as physical fermion mass. An alternative possibility, that of a
rearrangement of fermionic degrees of freedom analogous to spin-charge
separation in condensed matter physics, is also briefly outlined.
