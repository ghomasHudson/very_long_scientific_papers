We construct examples in any odd dimension of contact manifolds with finite
and non-zero algebraic torsion (in the sense of Latschev-Wendl), which are
therefore tight and do not admit strong symplectic fillings. We prove that
Giroux torsion implies algebraic $1$-torsion in any odd dimension, which proves
a conjecture by Massot-Niederkrueger-Wendl. These results are part of the
author's PhD thesis.
