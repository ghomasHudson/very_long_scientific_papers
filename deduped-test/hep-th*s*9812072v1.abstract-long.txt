I review certain aspects of Hanany-Witten setups and other approaches used to
embed (and solve) gauge theories in string theory. Applications covered include dualities
in 4 and 3 dimensions, fixed points in 6 dimensions, phase transitions between different
geometric backgrounds and dualities between branes and geometry.
