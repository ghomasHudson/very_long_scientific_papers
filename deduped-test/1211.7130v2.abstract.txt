In this master's thesis, we recall the definitions and basic results for Lie
superalgebras. We specify the definition for Klein graded Lie algebras and,
motivated by well known results for Lie superalgebras, we prove similar results
for Klein graded Lie algebras. More precisely, we state the theorems of
Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt and Ado's, as well as Schur's lemma. Moreover, we
present two examples of Klein graded algebra.
