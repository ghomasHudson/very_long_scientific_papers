Quantum computing had a profound impact on cryptography. Shor’s
discovery of an efficient quantum algorithm for factoring large integers
implies that nearly all existing classical systems based on
computational assumptions can be broken, once a quantum computer is
built. It is therefore imperative to find other means of implementing
secure protocols. This thesis aims to contribute to the understanding of
both the physical limitations, as well as the possibilities of
cryptography in the quantum setting. To this end, we first investigate
two notions that are crucial to the security of quantum protocols:
uncertainty relations and entanglement. How can we find good uncertainty
relations for a large number of measurement settings? How does the
presence of entanglement affect classical protocols? And, what
limitations does it impose on implementing quantum protocols? Finally,
can we circumvent some of those limitations using realistic assumptions?
