The non-classical, non-local quantum correlations so-called entanglement
, which are possibly the greatest mystery of quantum mechanics, have
been proved to be a very useful resource. Entanglement may be used to
make exponentially faster computations with a quantum computer than the
equivalent ones with a classical computer. Also, it has been shown to
introduce advantages in the quantum communication protocols over the
classical ones. Moreover, nowadays it is possible to codify provably
secure messages through the quantum cryptography protocols (which have a
deep relationship with entanglement), in opposition to the classical
protocols, which are just conditionally secure.

This Thesis is devoted to the analysis of entanglement in relevant
physical systems. Entanglement is the conducting theme of this research,
though I do not dedicate to a single topic, but consider a wide scope of
physical situations.

I have followed mainly three lines of research for this Thesis, with a
series of different works each, which are:

-    Entanglement and Relativistic Quantum Theory.

    I show the unbounded entanglement growth appearing in @xmath -matrix
    theory of scattering for incident fermions with sharp momentum
    distributions, in the context of quantum electrodynamics. I study
    the possibility of spin entanglement generation through
    spin-independent scattering of identical particles. I also analyze
    the properties of Lorentz invariance and relativity of entanglement
    distillability and separability. I propose the complete simulation
    of Dirac equation and its remarkable relativistic quantum effects
    like Zitterbewegung or Kleinâ€™s paradox in a single trapped ion.

-    Continuous-variable entanglement.

    I demonstrate that an arbitrary, unbounded degree of entanglement
    may be achieved between two atoms by measurements on the light they
    emit, when taking into account additional ancillary photons. I
    detect the spin entanglement loss due to transfer of correlations to
    the momentum degree of freedom of @xmath fermions or photons,
    through local interactions entangling spin and momentum. I also
    develop a mathematical method for computing analytic approximations
    of the Schmidt modes of a bipartite amplitude with continuous
    variables. I study the momentum entanglement generated in the decay
    of unstable systems and verify that, surprisingly, the asymptotic
    entanglement is smaller for wider decay widths, related to stronger
    interactions.

-    Multipartite entanglement.

    After a careful analysis of the @xmath approximate quantum cloning
    for qubits sequentially implemented, I show that it can be done with
    just linear resources of the ancilla: the dimension of the ancilla
    Hilbert space grows linearly with the number of clones, while for
    arbitrary multiqubit states sequentially generated it would grow
    exponentially in the number of qubits. This has remarkable
    experimental interest as it provides a procedure for reducing
    approximate quantum cloning to sequential two-body interactions,
    which are the ones experimentally feasible in laboratory. I also
    propose an inductive scheme for the classification of @xmath
    -partite entanglement, for arbitrary @xmath , under stochastic local
    operations and classical communication, based on the analysis of the
    coefficient matrix of the pure state in an arbitrary product basis.
    I give the complete classification of genuine 4-qubit entanglement.
