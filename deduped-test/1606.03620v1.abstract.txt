This thesis broadly concerns the origins of life problem, pursuing a joint
approach that combines general philosophical/conceptual reflection on the
problem along with more detailed and formal scientific modelling work oriented
in the conceptual perspective developed. The central subject matter addressed
is the emergence and maintenance of compartmentalised chemistries as precursors
of more complex systems with a proper cellular organization. Whereas an
evolutionary conception of life dominates prebiotic chemistry research and
overflows into the protocells field, this thesis defends that the 'autonomous
systems perspective' of living phenomena is a suitable - arguably the most
suitable - conceptual framework to serve as a backdrop for protocell research.
The autonomy approach allows a careful and thorough reformulation of the
origins of cellular life problem as the problem of how integrated autopoietic
chemical organisation, present in all full-fledged cells, originated and
developed from more simple far-from-equilibrium chemical aggregate systems.
