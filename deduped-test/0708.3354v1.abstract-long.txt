In 2005, building on his own recent work and that of F. Zanello, A.
Iarrobino discovered some constructions that, he conjectured, would
yield level algebras with non-unimodal Hilbert functions. This thesis
provides proofs of non-unimodality for Iarrobino’s level algebras, as
well as for other level algebras that the author has constructed along
similar lines.

The key technical contribution is to extend some results published by
Iarrobino in 1984. Iarrobino’s results provide insight into some
naturally arising vector subspaces of the vector space @xmath of forms
of fixed degree in a polynomial ring in several variables. In this
thesis, the problem is approached by combinatorial methods and results
similar to Iarrobino’s are proved for a different class of vector
subspaces of @xmath .

The combinatorial methods involve the definition of a new class of
matrices called L-Matrices , which have useful properties that are
inherited by their submatrices. A particular class of square L-Matrices,
associated with some specialized partially ordered sets having
interesting combinatorial properties, is identified. For this class of
L-Matrices, necessary and sufficient conditions are given that they be
nonsingular.

Several larger questions are discussed whose answers are incrementally
improved by the knowledge that the new non-unimodal level algebras
exist.
