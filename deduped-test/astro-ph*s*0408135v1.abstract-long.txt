The abundance of iron, magnesium, calcium and sodium in @xmath Centauri
A ( @xmath Cen A) is determined from strong lines of these elements
using the theory of collisional line broadening of alkali and other
spectral lines by neutral hydrogen developed by Anstee & O’Mara [1] and
the spectrum synthesis program of John Ross [2]. The derived abundance
is independent of non–thermal motions in the photosphere and is in good
agreement with the results obtained by Chmielewski et al. [3] and
Furenlid & Meylan [4] within the uncertainties involved.

As the abundances are derived from the wings of strong lines they are
independent of non–thermal motions in the photosphere of @xmath Cen A.
The microturbulence is then determined using medium–strong lines of iron
by fixing the abundance of iron to the value determined from the strong
lines of iron, and adjusting the microturbulence to match the observed
equivalent width of each line. The microturbulence is the average of the
values obtained for all lines. This microturbulence can then be used in
determination of the abundance of other elements for which there are no
strong lines in the spectrum.

The abundances of iron, magnesium, calcium and sodium in @xmath Cen A
are approximately 0.2 dex higher than in the Sun. Also the
microturbulence in the atmosphere of @xmath Cen A which is (with the aid
of the improved theory of line broadening) determined independently of
the abundances is 1.34 km/s i.e., 0.20 km/s greater than on the Sun.
