# Resumo

As primeiras tentativas de evolução da geometria de um sistema binário
de buracos negros datam da década de 60, com o trabalho pioneiro de Hahn
e Lindquist. Apesar de todos os avanços computacionais e enormes
esforços por parte de vários grupos, as primeiras evoluções estáveis da
órbita e coalescência de dois buracos negros foram conseguidas apenas 40
anos depois, em 2005. Desde então, o campo da Relatividade Numérica
amadureceu, e tem sido usado extensivamente para explorar e descobrir
fenómenos físicos em vários cenários.

Nesta tese, levamos este campo a novas fronteiras e exploramos extensões
a dimensões extra, espaços não-assimptoticamente planos e teoria de
Einstein-Maxwell. Começamos por rever o formalismo e ferramentas usuais,
incluindo a decomposição “3+1”, construção de dados iniciais, o esquema
de evolução BSSN e os procedimentos padrão de extracção de radiação.
Seguidamente apresentamos um procedimento de redução dimensional que
permite o uso de códigos numéricos existentes (com adaptações menores)
para evoluir sistemas em dimensões mais elevadas com simetria
suficiente, apresentando ainda os correspondentes resultados obtidos
para colisões frontais de buracos negros em cinco dimensões. Finalmente,
mostramos resultados em espaços não-assimptoticamente planos e teoria de
Einstein-Maxwell.

### 1.1 Motivation and historical background

Formulated by Einstein in 1915 [ Einstein:1915by , Einstein:1915bz ,
Einstein:1915ca ] , general relativity is one of the most beautiful
theories ever discovered. Its very elegance, however, can also be a
disadvantage. We are able to do purely analytical calculations—sometimes
using just pen and paper—in highly symmetrical ideal examples where
exact solutions are known, or limits where gravity is weak. Alas, Nature
is not that simple.

To attack more complicated problems—such as those with strong and
dynamical gravitational fields—one will eventually need to perform
numerical computations. The quintessential example is the two-body
problem. With well known solutions in terms of conics in Newtonian
gravity, the equivalent problem in general relativity—the evolution of a
black hole binary—posses no (known) closed-form solution. Perturbative
analytical techniques do exist and some are very well suited to study
certain stages of this problem. In particular, the inspiral phase
(before the merger) is well modelled by post-Newtonian methods; the
ringdown phase (after merger) can be described by perturbative methods
using the quasi-normal modes of the final black hole. Full numerical
simulations are required, however, to evolve the system during the
merger.

Much of the motivation to understand the nature of such systems and the
corresponding energy emitted via gravitational radiation originally came
from the gravitational wave astronomy field. A first generation of
highly sensitive gravitational waves detectors—LIGO [ Abramovici:1992ah
] , Virgo [ Caron:1997hu ] , GEO [ Luck:1997hv ] and TAMA [ Ando:2001ej
] —have been operational and a second generation of even more sensitive
detectors is under construction. These detectors may allow us to study
signals produced from strong-field systems, which carry the specific
signature of the system that produced them. The analysis of these
signals may then provide us with a new window to the universe. For that,
however, we rely on source modelling: templates of theoretical waveforms
from likely sources are needed if one wishes to reconstruct the signal.

Numerical relativity can be regarded as a tool to study spacetimes that
cannot be studied by analytical means. It dates back to the mid 1960s
with Hahn and Lindquist’s attempts of numerically evolving Einstein’s
field equations for a binary black hole spacetime [ 1964AnPhy..29..304H
] . Their computer power was very limited, however, and not much physics
could be extracted from the simulation. More reliable simulations were
only performed in the late 1970s by Smarr [ Smarr:1976qy ] and Eppley [
Eppley:1977dk ] , which again attempted the head-on collision of two
black holes. Though almost a decade after Hahn and Lindquist, the
available computer power was still only enough to evolve low resolution
simulations.

With the development of faster computers and the extra motivation of
returning to the two-body problem coming from LIGO, the 1990s finally
witnessed the simulation of a head-on collision of two black holes [
Bernstein:1994wt , Anninos:1994gp ] as well as the study of more complex
systems. To name just a few: simulations of rapidly rotating neutron
stars [ Stergioulas:1997ja ] , the formation of a toroidal event horizon
in the collapse of a system containing a toroidal distribution of
particles [ Shapiro:1992gr , Hughes:1994ea ] and one of the most
influential results, gravitational collapse and its relation with
critical phenomena [ Choptuik:1992jv ] . For a more comprehensive
overview see, for example, [ Lehner:2001wq ] .

In spite of all these successes, the real breakthrough came only in 2005
with the first simulations of stable, long-term evolutions of the
inspiral and merger of two black holes [ Pretorius:2005gq , Baker:2005vv
, Campanelli:2005dd ] . For an overview of the two-body problem in
general relativity see [ Pretorius:2007nq ] .

Since then, numerical codes have considerably improved and much progress
has been made. In particular, we have witnessed numerical evolutions of
(see e.g. [ Hinder:2010vn ] for a thorough overview of some recent
results):

-   binary black hole mergers lasting for 15 orbits before merger [
    Boyle:2007ft , Scheel:2008rj ] . The corresponding waveforms, which
    include the infall, non-linear merger and ringdown phase, have been
    used in comparisons with post-Newtonian results.

-   black hole binaries with mass ratios up to @xmath [ Lousto:2010ut ,
    Sperhake:2011ik ] . Waveforms for high mass ratios are essential,
    since they are expected to be the most common, astrophysically.
    Computationally, however, they are much more demanding than
    comparable mass cases.

-   rotating black holes with near extremal spin [ Lovelace:2011nu ,
    Lousto:2012es ] .

-   zoom-whirl orbits—characterised by black hole trajectories that
    alternate between a whirling quasi-circular motion and a highly
    eccentric quasi-elliptical zooming out [ Pretorius:2007jn ,
    Healy:2009zm ] .

-   so called “superkick” configurations—equal mass black holes with
    (initially) opposite spin vectors lying in the orbital plane—where
    the post-merger recoil velocity can reach up to @xmath km/s [
    Campanelli:2007cga , Brugmann:2007zj ] . Recently [ Lousto:2011kp ]
    , this effect was combined with the “hangup” configuration [
    Campanelli:2006uy ] —where the black holes have spin aligned with
    the orbital angular momentum—to predict maximum recoils up to @xmath
    km/s. Given that such velocities are enough to eject a black hole
    from the centre of a galaxy [ Merritt:2004xa ] , these results could
    have important consequences for astronomy (such as in structure
    formation), see e.g. [ BoylanKolchin:2004tf , Haiman:2004ve ,
    Madau:2004st , Komossa:2012cy ] .

-   high velocity collisions of black holes—head-on collisions up to
    @xmath [ Sperhake:2008ga ] , where the radiated energy was found to
    be around @xmath when extrapolating the relative velocity between
    the black holes to @xmath ; as well as non-head-on collisions [
    Shibata:2008rq , Sperhake:2009jz ] , where the impact parameter for
    black hole merger was determined in the limit where the relative
    velocity approaches @xmath .

As we can observe from these previous examples, numerical relativity has
now reached a state of maturity and, at least in the four-dimensional
asymptotically flat vacuum case, is largely under control allowing us to
evolve a large class of different configurations.

Motivation to study gravity in the dynamical/strong field regime is not
restricted to the evolution of the two-body problem or variations
thereof, and computation of the respective waveform. Indeed, incentive
to study such systems also comes from fields other than gravity itself.
In the following we mention some of these topics and briefly describe
how numerical relativity can be expected to shed light on some
outstanding issues.

  Tests of cosmic censorship hypothesis  

    
    It has been known for some time from the Penrose-Hawking singularity
    theorems that, quite generically, solutions of Einstein’s field
    equations with physically reasonable matter content can develop
    singularities [ HawkingEllis ] . If such singularities are visible
    to the rest of spacetime (i.e., no horizon is covering them),
    predictability may break down. Originally formulated by Penrose in
    1969 [ Penrose:1969pc ] , what is known as the weak cosmic
    censorship conjecture roughly states that, generically,
    singularities of gravitational collapse are covered by an event
    horizon and therefore have no causal contact with distant observers.

    In the absence of a generic proof ¹ ¹ 1 Indeed, the conjecture has
    not even been stated in a rigorous way—as often happens, that is
    part of the task. , one can try and put the conjecture to the test
    in specific configurations. The ability to perform full blown
    non-linear numerical simulations in arbitrary spacetimes could here
    prove invaluable.

    With such simulations, the conjecture has been shown to hold under
    extremely violent events—the ultra-relativistic collision of black
    holes [ Sperhake:2008ga ] . In higher-dimensional gravity, it was
    shown by Lehner and Pretorius that cosmic censorship does not seem
    to hold generically, even in vacuum [ Lehner:2010pn ] .
    Specifically, it was shown that five dimensional black strings
    (solutions of five dimensional vacuum gravity, known to be unstable
    [ Gregory:1993vy ] ) display, when perturbed, a self-similar
    behaviour that ultimately gives rise to naked singularities in
    rather generic conditions. Also in higher dimensions, results by
    Okawa et al. [ Okawa:2011fv ] seem to indicate that in a
    high-velocity scattering of five-dimensional black holes, curvature
    radius shorter than the Planck length can be observed (i.e., no
    horizon is covering this region). This could be regarded as an
    effective singularity in classical gravity.

  Stability of (higher-dimensional) black hole solutions  

    
    Higher dimensional gravity has a much richer diversity of black
    object solutions than its four dimensional counterpart. Spherical
    topology is not the only allowed topology for objects with a horizon
    and one can also have, e.g., black rings (with a donut-like
    topology) [ Emparan:2001wn , Pomeransky:2006bd ] and even regular
    solutions with disconnected horizons, such as the “black Saturn” [
    Elvang:2007rd ] , the “black di-ring” [ Iguchi:2007is ] or the
    “bicycling black rings” [ Elvang:2007hs ] .

    The study of these objects is relevant for a number of reasons.
    Other than the obvious intrinsic value that such studies carry and
    the possibly interesting mathematical properties that some of these
    objects may have, the understanding of these solutions can also be
    helpful for: (i) quantum gravity—the calculations of black hole
    entropy within string theory were first performed in five
    dimensional spacetimes, and only afterwards extended to four
    dimensions; (ii) gauge/gravity correspondence, which maps properties
    of @xmath -dimensional black holes to strongly coupled field
    theories in @xmath dimensions; (iii) large extra dimensions
    scenarios, suggesting that (microscopic) higher-dimensional black
    objects could be formed in particle collisions with centre of mass
    energy @xmath (such as at the LHC). See the review article [
    Emparan:2008eg ] for more details and further motivation.

    The stability of these higher-dimensional black objects is now
    starting to be explored. It had been conjectured that for @xmath
    ultra-spinning Myers-Perry black holes will be unstable [
    Emparan:2003sy ] , and this instability has been confirmed by an
    analysis of linearised axi-symmetric perturbations in @xmath [
    Dias:2009iu ] .

    Clearly, the study of the non-linear development of these
    instabilities and determination of the respective endpoint requires
    numerical methods. Such studies have been recently presented for a
    non axi-symmetric perturbation in @xmath [ Shibata:2009ad ] and
    @xmath [ Shibata:2010wz ] , where it was found that the single
    spinning Myers-Perry black hole is unstable, for sufficiently large
    rotation parameter.

  AdS/CFT correspondence  

    
    In 1997–98, a powerful tool known as the AdS/CFT correspondence (or
    the gauge/gravity duality, or even, more generically, as holography
    ) was introduced [ Maldacena:1997re ] . This holographic
    correspondence (if true in general) is extremely powerful since it
    maps the dynamics of a non-perturbative, strongly coupled regime of
    certain gauge theories in @xmath dimensions to @xmath -dimensional
    classical gravity. This means that, for such gauge theories, we can
    map strongly coupled quantum field theory dynamics to systems of
    partial differential equations, which can in principle be solved
    (numerically, if needed).

    In particular, high energy collisions of black holes are said to
    have a dual description in terms of high energy collisions with
    balls of de-confined plasma surrounded by a confining phase. These
    are the type of events that may have direct observational
    consequences for the experiments at Brookhaven’s Relativistic Heavy
    Ion Collider (RHIC) [ Amsel:2007cw , Gubser:2008pc ] .

    Numerical relativity in anti-de Sitter (AdS) is notoriously
    difficult, and therefore progress has been slow in applying its
    techniques to the aforementioned problems. Nevertheless, some
    exciting results have been recently put forth [ Chesler:2009cy ,
    Chesler:2010bi , Bantilan:2012vu ] .

  TeV-scale gravity scenarios  

    
    As first pointed out by ’t Hooft [ 'tHooft:1987rb ] , if two point
    particles collide at energies above the Planck energy, it is
    expected that gravity should dominate the interaction and thus,
    quite remarkably, the process should be well described by general
    relativity.

    Thorne’s Hoop Conjecture [ Thorne:1972ji ] further tells us that if
    one traps a given amount of Energy @xmath in a region of space such
    that a circular hoop with radius @xmath encloses this matter in all
    directions , a black hole is formed if its Schwarzschild radius
    @xmath . This conjecture (or rather, the classical variant thereof)
    has recently gained more support with the work by Choptuik and
    Pretorius [ Choptuik:2009ww ] , where it was shown that collisions
    of boson stars do form black holes, for sufficiently high boost
    parameter.

    If this conjecture does hold, it would imply that particle
    collisions could produce black holes [ Dimopoulos:2001hw ,
    Giddings:2001bu ] . As argued above, the production of black holes
    at trans-Planckian collision energies (compared to the fundamental
    Planck scale) should be well described by using classical general
    relativity (see also [ Kanti:2008eq ] and references therein).
    Writing down the exact solution describing the collision of two
    ultra-relativistic particles in general relativity is not feasible,
    however, and approximations have to be used. One possible
    approximation (good for its simplicity) is to use black holes, and
    model the scattering of point particles by black hole collisions.

    This gains further relevance in the context of the so-called
    TeV-gravity scenarios. Such models were proposed as a possible
    solution to the hierarchy problem , i.e., the relative weakness of
    gravity by about 40 orders of magnitude compared to the other
    fundamental interactions. It has been proposed that this can be
    resolved if one adopts the idea that the Standard Model is confined
    to a brane in a higher dimensional space, such that the extra
    dimensions are much larger than the four dimensional Planck scale
    (they may be large up to a sub-millimetre scale) [ Antoniadis:1990ew
    , ArkaniHamed:1998rs , Antoniadis:1998ig ] . In a different version
    of the model, the extra dimensions are infinite, but the metric has
    an exponential factor introducing a finite length scale [
    Randall:1999ee , Randall:1999vf ] .

    In such models, the fundamental Planck scale could be as low as 1
    TeV. Thus, high energy colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider
    (LHC), may directly probe strongly coupled gravitational physics [
    Argyres:1998qn , Banks:1999gd , Giddings:2001bu , Dimopoulos:2001hw
    , Ahn:2002mj , Chamblin:2004zg ] . In fact, such tests may even be
    routinely available in the collisions of ultra-high energy cosmic
    rays with the Earth’s atmosphere [ Feng:2001ib , Ahn:2003qn ,
    Cardoso:2004zi ] , or in astrophysical black hole environments [
    Banados:2009pr , Berti:2009bk , Jacobson:2009zg ] (for reviews see [
    Cavaglia:2002si , Kanti:2004nr , Kanti:2008eq ] ).

    Numerical simulations of high energy black hole collisions in higher
    dimensional spacetimes, then, could give an accurate estimate of the
    fractions of the collision energy and angular momentum that are lost
    in the higher-dimensional space by emission of gravitational waves;
    such information would be extremely important to improve the
    modelling of microscopic black hole production, and of the ensuing
    evaporation phase, which might be observed during LHC collisions.

    The challenge is then to use the classical framework to determine
    the cross section for production and, for each initial setup, the
    fractions of the collision energy and angular momentum that are lost
    in the higher dimensional space by emission of gravitational waves.
    This information will be of paramount importance to improve the
    modelling of microscopic black hole production in event generators
    such as Truenoir [ Dimopoulos:2001hw ] , Charybdis2 [ Frost:2009cf ]
    , Catfish [ Cavaglia:2006uk ] or Blackmax [ Dai:2007ki , Dai:2009by
    ] . The event generators will then provide a description of the
    corresponding evaporation phase, which might be observed during LHC
    collisions.

For a thorough review of these topics, challenges and how tools coming
from numerical relativity can help see [ Cardoso:2012qm ] .

### 1.2 The new frontiers

With these motivations in mind, we propose in this thesis to extend
current numerical relativity tools to new frontiers.

#### 1.2.1 Higher-dimensional gravity

The first such frontier, in light of our discussion in the previous
section, is higher-dimensional gravity. We start by emphasising that
full blown @xmath , @xmath , etc. numerical simulations of Einstein’s
field equations without symmetry are currently (and in the near future)
not possible due to the heavy computational costs. We have thus
developed a framework and a numerical code that can, in principle, be
applied to different spacetime dimensions (with enough symmetry) with
little adaptations. This is achieved by taking the @xmath dimensional
vacuum spacetime to have an isometry group fit to include a large class
of interesting problems. If this isometry group is sufficiently large,
it allows a dimensional reduction of the problem to 3+1 dimensions,
where our originally higher-dimensional problem now appears as (four
dimensional) general relativity coupled to source terms. Thus, the
different spacetime dimensions manifest themselves only in the different
“matter” content of the four dimensional theory. An obvious advantage of
this approach is that we can use existing numerical codes with small
adaptations: taking a working four-dimensional code, the four
dimensional equations need to be coupled to the appropriate source terms
and some issues related to the chosen coordinates must be addressed.
Incidentally, other issues possibly related with the choice of gauge
conditions further complicate the problem.

We should here point out that alternative approaches have been proposed
to evolve numerically Einstein’s equations in higher dimensions, as well
as other codes tailored to study specific problems. In particular we
note the previously mentioned pioneering works concerned with the
non-linear development of the Gregory-Laflamme instability [
Gregory:1993vy ] of cosmic strings [ Choptuik:2003qd , Lehner:2010pn ] ;
studies of gravitational collapse [ Sorkin:2009bc , Sorkin:2009wh ] ;
static situations [ Headrick:2009pv ] ; and the alternative approach,
based on the Cartoon method [ Alcubierre:1999ab ] , that has been
developed and tested by Yoshino and Shibata [ Yoshino:2009xp ,
Shibata:2010wz ] . For a review of numerical relativity in
higher-dimensions see also [ Yoshino:2011zz , Yoshino:2011zza ] .

#### 1.2.2 Non-asymptotically flat geometries

Another frontier has to do with numerical evolutions in
non-asymptotically flat spacetimes.

  de Sitter  

    
    Going back to four dimensions, an obvious first choice of a
    non-asymptotically flat spacetime is de Sitter , the simplest model
    for an accelerating universe. de Sitter is a maximally symmetric
    solution of Einstein’s equations with a positive cosmological
    constant, describing a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology
    with a constant Hubble parameter. There is now a large body of
    observational evidence for a present cosmological acceleration well
    modelled by a positive cosmological constant @xmath [ Komatsu:2010fb
    ] .

    Cosmological dynamics should leave imprints in gravitational
    phenomena, such as gravitational radiation emitted in a black hole
    binary coalescence. Identifying such signatures can thus be
    phenomenologically relevant in view of ongoing efforts to directly
    detect gravitational radiation.

    Studying the dynamics of black holes in asymptotically de Sitter
    spacetimes can also potentially teach us about more fundamental
    questions such as cosmic censorship, as in the following scenario.
    Consider two black holes of sufficiently large mass in a de Sitter
    spacetime. If, upon merger, the final black hole is too large to fit
    in its cosmological horizon the end state of such an evolution would
    be a naked singularity. This possibility begs for a time evolution
    of such a configuration, which we will show and discuss.

  Black holes in a box  

    
    As argued above, having a framework to solve Einstein’s equations in
    asymptotically Anti-de Sitter geometries would be of major help for
    studies of AdS/CFT duality, in particular in dynamical settings.
    This is no easy task, however, and a major reason for that is the
    “active role” played by the boundary of AdS spaces. This is easily
    visualised in the Penrose diagram of AdS, which has a timelike
    boundary. Null geodesics in AdS reach the boundary in a finite
    affine parameter, and one therefore often refers to an
    asymptotically AdS space as a “box”, having in mind that AdS
    boundary conditions directly affect the bulk physics [ Wald:1980jn ,
    Ishibashi:2003jd , Ishibashi:2004wx ] .

    As a first step to model the role of the boundary in evolutions, we
    will here give an overview of the work reported in [ Witek:2010qc ]
    where a toy model for AdS was considered. Therein, as we will
    explain, the cosmological constant is set to zero and mirror-like
    boundary conditions are imposed on a box containing the dynamical
    system, which mimics the global AdS geometry.

    Inside this box, black hole binaries are evolved, producing an
    inspiralling merger. Such systems are very well tested in standard
    asymptotically flat spacetimes with purely outgoing boundary
    conditions, and differences to these cases can be clearly seen.

  Black holes in cylinders  

    
    Again in the topic of higher-dimensional gravity, now in scenarios
    with compact extra dimensions, a natural question to ask is how the
    compactness of the extra dimensions changes the dynamics of such
    scenarios (as opposed to the asymptotically flat cases) and
    understanding the role of the compactness of the extra dimensions in
    the aforementioned TeV gravity scenarios.

    There is considerable literature on Kaluza-Klein black holes and
    black holes on cylinders [ Myers:1986rx , Korotkin:1994dw ,
    Frolov:2003kd , Harmark:2005pp ] , but, to the best of our
    knowledge, the full non-linear dynamics of black holes in such
    spacetimes remain unexplored.

    In this spirit, using the formalism developed for higher-dimensional
    spacetimes, we have started exploring what happens when one of the
    directions is compactified.

#### 1.2.3 Einstein-Maxwell

Finally, we have started exploring the electrovacuum Einstein-Maxwell
system. We first note that while the dynamics of black holes interacting
with electromagnetic fields and plasmas have been the subject of a
number of numerical studies (e.g. [ Palenzuela:2009yr ,
Palenzuela:2010nf ] ), dynamics of charged (Reissner-Nordström) black
holes have remained rather unexplored.

Studying the dynamics of charged black holes is relevant for a number of
reasons. In the context of astrophysics, charged black holes may
actually be of interest in realistic systems. First, a rotating black
hole in an external magnetic field will accrete charged particles up to
a given value, @xmath [ Wald:1974np ] . It is thus conceivable that
astrophysical black holes could have some (albeit rather small) amount
of electrical charge. It is then of interest to understand the role of
this charge in the Blandford-Znajek mechanism [ Blandford:1977ds ] ,
which has been suggested for extracting spin energy from the hole, or in
a related mechanism capable of extracting energy from a moving black
hole [ Palenzuela:2010nf , Palenzuela:2010xn ] to power outflows from
accretion disk-fed black holes. Also of interest is investigating the
role of charge in post-merger recoil velocities of black hole binaries,
and see if the recently predicted recoils of @xmath km/s [ Lousto:2011kp
] could be exceeded.

Incentive to study such systems also comes from outside of astrophysics.
In particular, as already mentioned above, it was argued by ’t Hooft [
'tHooft:1987rb ] , that in trans-Planckian particle collisions, gravity
should dominate the interaction and thus the process should be well
described by general relativity—we can say that, for ultra high energy
collisions, matter does not matter [ Choptuik:2009ww ] . Calculations of
shock wave collisions, however, seem to suggest that even though other
interactions—say charge—may become irrelevant in the ultra-relativistic
limit, the properties of the final black hole (and of the associated
emission of gravitational radiation) will in fact depend on the amount
of charge carried by the colliding particles [ Yoshino:2006dp ,
Gingrich:2006qh ] . One then wonders whether the often repeated matter
does not matter scenario is actually true.

Light can be shed in this issue by performing highly boosted collisions
of charged black holes (analogous to the ones performed in vacuum [
Sperhake:2008ga , Shibata:2008rq ] ) and comparing the results—in
particular the profile of the corresponding waveform—against equivalent
electrically neutral systems.

With these incentives, we will report on the first steps taken in the
numerical evolution of Reissner-Nordström black holes, building on
previous numerical evolutions of the Einstein-Maxwell system [
Palenzuela:2008sf , Palenzuela:2009yr , Palenzuela:2009hx , Mosta:2009rr
] .

### 1.3 Structure

The structure of this thesis is as follows. We start by reviewing, in
chapter 2 , standard differential geometry results, summarise the
formalism of the “ @xmath ’’ decomposition ² ² 2 Usually found in the
literature as “3+1” decomposition. Here we will keep the @xmath
arbitrary, but the differences are minimal. and conformal decomposition
to write Einstein’s equations in a dynamical systems form. In chapter 3
we then review the construction of relevant initial data for the class
of problems we will be interested on and discuss, in chapter 4 , the
numerical implementation of Einstein’s equations: first, we need to
re-write the evolution equations in the so-called BSSN (Baumgarte,
Shapiro, Shibata, Nakamura) form; we next discuss the gauge conditions
and finish by giving a very brief overview of the numerical code we use
for the simulations. In chapter 5 we review the usual procedures to
extract the physical results from numerical simulations: wave extracting
and horizon finding. These chapters consist mostly of review material
found in the usual literature (e.g. [ Gourgoulhon:2007ue ,
Alcubierre:2008 , baumgarte2010numerical ] ). Finally, in chapter 6 , we
introduce a dimensional reduction procedure that allows us to reduce
higher-dimensional systems (with enough symmetry) to effective
four-dimensional theories with source terms. This enables us to perform
numerical evolutions of such higher-dimensional systems by adapting
existing numerical codes. We also discuss the construction of initial
data and present results. Chapter 7 is dedicated to evolutions in
non-asymptotically flat spacetimes: we present the aforementioned
collisions of black holes in asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes, black
holes in a box and black holes in asymptotically cylindrical spacetimes.
In chapter 8 we report on evolutions of charged black holes, in
electrovacuum Einstein-Maxwell theory, and we end with some final
remarks and future directions in chapter 9 .

### 1.4 Preliminaries

Let us consider a @xmath -dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold @xmath
, that is, a differentiable manifold @xmath equipped with a smooth,
symmetric metric tensor @xmath with signature @xmath . We further assume
that the manifold is covered by a set of coordinates @xmath , @xmath .

A coordinate basis of the tangent space of @xmath at @xmath , @xmath ,
is given by @xmath . A vector @xmath can be written in the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.4.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath are the components of @xmath in the basis @xmath . When a
vector @xmath acts on a function @xmath it produces the directional
derivative of @xmath along @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.4.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

A 1-form @xmath (the cotangent space at @xmath ) is an object which is
dual to a vector, i.e., it produces a number when acting on a vector.
The simplest example of such an object is the differential @xmath of a
function @xmath . The action of @xmath on @xmath is defined to be

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.4.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Since @xmath , @xmath is a natural choice as a basis of @xmath . We thus
naturally expand an arbitrary 1-form @xmath as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.4.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The metric tensor @xmath allows us to define a scalar product between
two vectors @xmath and @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.4.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which induces an isomorphism between vectors and 1-forms, corresponding
in the index notation to the usual raising and lowering of indices: if
@xmath is a vector, one can define a 1-form @xmath through

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.4.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Analogously, given a 1-form @xmath we can map it to a vector @xmath
through

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.4.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Since we will be working mostly in the index notation, and the placement
of the index makes clear whether one is dealing with vectors of 1-forms,
we will omit the flat and sharp symbols throughout.

The metric further allows us to determine the distance between two
nearby points in the manifold according to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.4.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Notice that a basis of @xmath (and of @xmath ) need not be coordinate.
One can have, for instance, the combination @xmath . @xmath is an
example of a non-coordinate basis .

We now introduce a (generic) non-coordinate basis obeying

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.4.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the Lie bracket @xmath is defined by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.4.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The connection coefficients @xmath then take the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.4.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath . When using coordinate basis ( @xmath ), these are usually
called the Christoffel symbols.

We now define the Riemann curvature tensor

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.4.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Mind the notation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.4.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Thus, @xmath .

General relativity is a geometric theory of gravity which relates the
curvature of spacetime to its matter content via the Einstein field
equations, which read

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.4.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the Ricci curvature tensor, @xmath its trace (the Ricci
scalar), @xmath the metric tensor and @xmath the stress-energy tensor.
All these quantities are @xmath -dimensional.

Throughout this work we will always use the @xmath metric signature and
geometrised units @xmath .

## Chapter 2 @xmath decomposition

We start by briefly stating some known results from differential
geometry that will be of use to us. In this chapter we use the following
conventions: Greek indices ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , …) run from 0 to
@xmath ; Latin indices ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , …) run from 1 to
@xmath .

We work on a @xmath -dimensional manifold @xmath with a metric @xmath .
We denote the torsion-free Levi-Civita connection on @xmath associated
with @xmath by @xmath . All quantities defined relative to the manifold
@xmath will have a leading @xmath superscript, e.g., the Riemann
curvature tensor on @xmath is denoted by @xmath .

### 2.1 Hypersurfaces

#### 2.1.1 Definition

A codimension 1 hypersurface @xmath is a @xmath -dimensional submanifold
of @xmath , defined as the image of a @xmath -dimensional manifold
@xmath by an embedding @xmath , @xmath [ Poisson:2004 ,
Gourgoulhon:2007ue ] . Given a scalar field @xmath on @xmath , we can
select a particular hypersurface @xmath by putting a restriction on the
coordinates

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

or by giving parametric equations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath are coordinates intrinsic to the hypersurface.

#### 2.1.2 Normal vector

The 1-form @xmath is normal to the hypersurface. We can introduce a unit
normal @xmath (if the hypersurface is not null) as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

With this definition

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

#### 2.1.3 Induced metric

We obtain the induced metric on @xmath by restricting the line element
to displacements confined to the hypersurface. Using the parametric
equations @xmath , we define the vectors

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

that are tangent to the curves in @xmath . For displacements confined to
@xmath we have

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.1.6)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is the induced metric of the hypersurface (also called the first
fundamental form of @xmath ). Notice that if @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

#### 2.1.4 Orthogonal projector

The orthogonal projector onto @xmath is a concept closely related with
that of the induced metric. For a hypersurface @xmath with unit normal
@xmath we define it as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

To see that this definition makes sense, we note that, for any vector
@xmath in @xmath (or, more correctly, in @xmath , the tangent space of
@xmath at @xmath ), @xmath will project it tangent to the hypersurface,
i.e., orthogonal to @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Notice also that the projector is idempotent:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Finally, note that for @xmath , @xmath acts just like the metric:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Thus, we see that the orthogonal projector @xmath is the natural
extension of the induced metric @xmath for all vectors in @xmath . As
such, from now on we will no longer make any distinction between these
two concepts, and will denote both by @xmath (defined as @xmath . This
way we adopt a @xmath -dimensional point of view, where we treat all
tensor fields defined on @xmath as if they were defined on @xmath and we
avoid the need to introduce a specific coordinate system on @xmath .

Note that we can project an arbitrary tensor on @xmath onto @xmath in
the following way. Let @xmath be a tensor field on @xmath . Denoting
@xmath another tensor in @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

we easily see that @xmath is in @xmath .

#### 2.1.5 Intrinsic curvature

We now want to define a covariant derivative associated with @xmath on
@xmath , @xmath , that has the “usual properties” of a covariant
derivative, in particular that it is torsion-free and satisfies

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The easiest way to define it is just to project the covariant derivative
@xmath onto @xmath using ( 2.1.8 ):

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

It can be shown [ Gourgoulhon:2007ue ] that this definition of the
covariant derivative has all the properties we want (linearity, Leibniz’
rule, its torsion vanishes, …) and it satisfies ( 2.1.13 ).

We can now define the Riemann tensor associated with this connection,
@xmath , as the measure of the non-commutativity of this covariant
derivative, associated with the @xmath metric on @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath .

@xmath represents the intrinsic curvature of @xmath .

#### 2.1.6 Extrinsic curvature

The intrinsic curvature of the hypersurface @xmath , as the name
implies, is a property of the hypersurface itself. We will now define
the extrinsic curvature , which depends on how @xmath is embedded on
@xmath . We define it as ¹ ¹ 1 Our definition, with the minus sign,
agrees with the standard convention used in the numerical relativity
community, but note that some authors use different conventions. [
Carroll:2004st ]

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

It can be shown that @xmath . Defining

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

we have, after some simple algebra,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We will always consider spacelike hypersurfaces, so from now on we will
work with @xmath . Note that, by definition, @xmath lives on @xmath .

### 2.2 Foliations

We assume that our spacetime can be foliated by a family of spacelike
hypersurfaces @xmath , that is, there exists a smooth scalar field
@xmath on @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In the following we will not distinguish between @xmath and @xmath .

#### 2.2.1 The lapse function

We write the unit normal vector as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is called the lapse function .

#### 2.2.2 Normal evolution vector

We define the normal evolution vector as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We can easily see that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which means that @xmath , unlike @xmath , is adapted to the scalar field
@xmath . It can be shown [ Gourgoulhon:2007ue ] that the hypersurfaces
@xmath are Lie dragged by @xmath . As consequence of this, if @xmath is
in @xmath , @xmath is also in @xmath .

#### 2.2.3 Eulerian observers

We can identify the unit timelike vector @xmath as the velocity (or the
“ @xmath -velocity”…) of some observer, that we will call the Eulerian
observer . The worldlines of these observers are orthogonal to the
hypersurfaces @xmath , which means that, for a given @xmath , the
hypersurface @xmath is the set of events that are simultaneous from the
point of view of the Eulerian observer.

We define the acceleration of the Eulerian observer the usual way,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Let us now list some formulæ that will be useful for the following
sections:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.2.6)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.2.7)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.2.8)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

#### 2.2.4 Evolution of @xmath

From the definition of Lie derivative and equation ( 2.2.8 ), one can
show

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which means that, for any tensor field @xmath on @xmath , its Lie
derivative along @xmath is also a tensor field on @xmath .

### 2.3 Gauss, Codazzi and Ricci equations

We still need a way to relate quantities defined on the hypersurface to
those defined on the manifold @xmath ; in particular, we would like to
have a relation between the @xmath -dimensional Riemann curvature
tensor, the @xmath -dimensional Riemann tensor on the hypersurface and
the extrinsic curvature. Such relations are common in differential
geometry—known as the equations of Gauss, Codazzi and Ricci—which we now
state without proof (see, e.g., [ Gourgoulhon:2007ue ] ).

#### 2.3.1 Gauss equation

The starting point is equation ( 2.1.15 ). We just need to use
equation ( 2.1.14 ) to relate @xmath with @xmath . After some algebra we
arrive at

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which is called the Gauss equation . Contracting this equation on @xmath
and @xmath we get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where we defined @xmath (where the equality comes from the fact that
@xmath lives on @xmath ). Taking the trace of this expression we have
(noting that @xmath )

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

#### 2.3.2 Codazzi equation

We now start with the following equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and we project it onto @xmath using ( 2.1.12 ). Using equation ( 2.1.18
) and after some algebra we arrive at

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which is called the Codazzi equation . Contracting this equation on
@xmath and @xmath we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

#### 2.3.3 Ricci equation

We still need one more projection of the Riemann tensor (in fact, the
last non-trivial projection). Again, we start with equation ( 2.3.4 ),
but this time we project it only twice onto @xmath and one time along
@xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Using equations ( 2.2.7 ), ( 2.2.8 ) and some properties of the Lie
derivative we arrive at

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which is called the Ricci equation . We can combine equation ( 2.3.8 )
with equation ( 2.3.2 ) to get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

### 2.4 Einstein equations

Our goal now is to write the Einstein equations in an explicit dynamical
system form. Let us start by writing the equations themselves in their
“traditional” form,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.4.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The alternative form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.4.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath , will also be useful to us.

#### 2.4.1 Decomposition of the stress-energy tensor

We define

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.4.3)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.4.4)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.4.5)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

which correspond to the matter energy density , the matter momentum
density and the matter stress density , respectively, as measured by the
Eulerian observer. We further define @xmath and note that @xmath .

#### 2.4.2 Projection of the Einstein equations

##### Projection onto @xmath

Using equation ( 2.3.9 ) we project equation ( 2.4.2 ) onto @xmath . We
get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.4.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Note that every single term in this equation lives in @xmath . Thus, we
can restrict the indices to spacial ones,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.4.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

##### Projection along @xmath

This step is easy, we just need to contract equation ( 2.4.1 ) with
@xmath and use ( 2.3.3 ), yielding

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.4.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This equation is called the Hamiltonian constraint .

##### Mixed projection

Finally, we need to project equation ( 2.4.1 ) once onto @xmath and once
along @xmath . Using equation ( 2.3.6 ) we get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.4.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This equation is called the momentum constraint .

### 2.5 Choice of coordinates

Equations ( 2.4.7 ) ( @xmath equations), ( 2.4.8 ) (1 equation) and (
2.4.9 ) ( @xmath equations) contain the same information as equation (
2.4.1 ) (it can be checked that the number of independent components is
the same: @xmath ). Before we can cast these equations in a dynamical
system form, however, we have to introduce a specific coordinate system,
something we have not yet done.

We will introduce coordinates adapted to the foliation @xmath in the
following way [ Gourgoulhon:2007ue ] . On each hypersurface @xmath we
have a coordinate system @xmath that is varying smoothly between
neighbouring hypersurfaces, so that @xmath is a well behaved coordinate
system on @xmath . In this coordinate system

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.5.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We define the shift vector @xmath as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.5.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

or in components, @xmath . Note that @xmath , so @xmath lives on @xmath
( @xmath . Using ( 2.5.2 ) we can also write

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.5.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Notice also that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We are now able to write the metric components @xmath relative to this
coordinate system,

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath            
  -- -------- -------- --

The line element is thus

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.5.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

or, in matrix form,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.5.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The inverse metric takes the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.5.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The determinants of @xmath and @xmath are related by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.5.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

### 2.6 The PDE system

Using the properties of the Lie derivative and the definition of shift
vector, equation ( 2.5.2 ), we can write

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.6.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Equation ( 2.2.9 ) can also be put in the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.6.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We now have our full system, which we rewrite here

  -- -------- -- ----------
                 
     @xmath      (2.6.3a)
     @xmath      (2.6.3b)
     @xmath      (2.6.3c)
     @xmath      (2.6.3d)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Note that we can write the covariant derivatives @xmath and the Lie
derivatives @xmath in terms of partial derivatives of the coordinates
@xmath , and the Ricci tensor @xmath and Ricci scalar @xmath in terms of
@xmath and its derivatives in the usual way. This way, assuming that the
source terms @xmath , @xmath , @xmath are given, we have a second-order
non-linear system of PDEs with the unknowns @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath .

The above equations ( 2.6.3 ) are known in the numerical relativity
community as the ADM equations , after the work of Arnowitt, Deser and
Misner [ Arnowitt:1962hi ] on their Hamiltonian formulation of general
relativity. In this form, however, the equations were in fact first
written by York [ York1979 ] (in four spacetime dimensions), and are
thus sometimes referred to as the ADM-York equations.

By now we have cast the Einstein equations on an explicit @xmath
-dimensional dynamical system form. Note, however, that whereas
equations ( 2.6.3a ) and ( 2.6.3b ) are evolution equations, equations (
2.6.3c ) and ( 2.6.3d ) are not. These last two equations constitute
constraints that the system must satisfy at all times. In particular,
these constraints must be satisfied at @xmath . So we would now need to
specify the relevant initial conditions, satisfying equations ( 2.6.3c )
and ( 2.6.3d ), and then evolve them using equations ( 2.6.3a ) and (
2.6.3b ), while making sure that equations ( 2.6.3c ) and ( 2.6.3d )
always hold.

The question arises: given a specific physical problem (say, a head-on
collision of two black holes), how does one specify the initial
conditions that correspond to the problem we have in mind? This is the
initial data problem which will be the focus of the next chapter.

## Chapter 3 Initial data

On any dynamical system, to perform an evolution one needs to supply the
initial conditions. In our case, this amounts to providing a snapshot of
the gravitational fields on some hypersurface—the initial data . Then,
one evolves this data to neighbouring hypersurfaces and so on.

In general relativity initial data cannot be freely specified. As we
have seen in chapter 2 , not all of Einstein’s equations are evolutions
equations. We also have a set of constraint equations that must be
satisfied at all times, the Hamiltonian ( 2.6.3c ) and momentum ( 2.6.3d
) constraints. In particular, these equations need to be solved at
@xmath for the @xmath that represent the physical system we are
interested in evolving. We then feed these values to the evolution
equations themselves.

In general, this step is far from trivial. There is no unique recipe for
the writing of initial data corresponding to an arbitrary gravitational
system. For some systems, however,—such as vacuum spacetimes with moving
black holes—recipes do exist. Actually, for the four-dimensional case,
several methods for constructing initial data for different systems have
been explored over the years (see [ Cook:2000vr ] for a review). For
higher-dimensional systems, however, only recently the “standard” way of
constructing initial data for moving black holes in the vacuum was
generalised [ Yoshino:2005ps , Yoshino:2006kc ] .

In this chapter we will give an overview of the procedure of conformal
decomposition first introduced by York and Lichnerowicz [
Lichnerowicz1944 , York1971 , York1972 , York1973 ] which rearranges the
degrees of freedom contained in the three-metric @xmath and extrinsic
curvature @xmath via a conformal transformation and a split of the
curvature into trace and traceless part followed by a
transverse-traceless decomposition of the conformally rescaled traceless
extrinsic curvature.

We will focus specifically on initial data for vacuum spacetimes,
generalising the well-known Brill-Lindquist [ Brill:1963yv ] and
Bowen-York [ Bowen:1980yu , Brandt:1997tf ] initial data along the lines
of [ Yoshino:2005ps , Yoshino:2006kc ] . For alternative procedures to
tackle the initial data problem we refer the reader to Cook’s review [
Cook:2000vr ] , Alcubierre’s book [ Alcubierre:2008 ] , the recent book
by Baumgarte & Shapiro [ baumgarte2010numerical ] and references
therein.

As in the previous chapter, Greek indices are spacetime indices running
from 0 to @xmath ; Latin indices are spatial indices, running from 1 to
@xmath .

### 3.1 Conformal decomposition

#### 3.1.1 Conformal transformations

We start by recalling a known general result: given an @xmath
-dimensional manifold with metric @xmath , if one performs the conformal
transformation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

the Ricci scalars relative to the metrics @xmath and @xmath are related
by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the covariant derivative associated with the conformal
metric @xmath .

Let us now consider our case, where we have a @xmath -dimensional
spacelike slice with induced metric @xmath and “conformal metric” @xmath
. We have @xmath , and we make

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We further decompose the extrinsic curvature in trace and trace-free
parts,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath and, by definition, @xmath . Defining @xmath , we can also
write

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

##### Conformal decomposition of the Hamiltonian and momentum constraint

Under such a transformation, it is a matter of simple substitution to
show that the Hamiltonian constraint equation ( 2.6.3c ) takes the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath .

With a straightforward calculation we can easily show that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath . Thus, we define

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and we will lower its indices with @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We thus have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Equation ( 2.4.9 ) is then written in the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.1.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

All we need now is to write equation ( 3.1.6 ) as function of @xmath ,
which is very easy. Our system is now

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.1.11)
     @xmath      (3.1.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

### 3.2 Initial data for vacuum spacetimes

Let us now consider the equations ( 3.1.11 ) and ( 3.1.12 ) for the
particular case of vacuum solutions ( @xmath ). We further impose that
the “conformal metric” @xmath is flat (and, thus, @xmath ) and the
“maximum slicing condition”, @xmath (to be discussed in section 4.2.1 ).
The equations ( 3.1.11 ) and ( 3.1.10 ) greatly simplify, and we are
left with

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.1)
     @xmath      (3.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is now the flat space Laplace operator.

Here we make a pause to recall that the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini metric
in @xmath dimensions is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath , @xmath being the mass of the black hole and @xmath the
area of the hypersphere. By performing the coordinate transformation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we can write it in isotropic coordinates as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We will shortly make use of this geometry.

#### 3.2.1 Brill-Lindquist initial data

We now assume that the extrinsic curvature vanishes identically, @xmath
, a condition that holds for time-symmetric initial data. It can be
shown [ Gourgoulhon:2007ue ] that if @xmath and we choose coordinates
such that @xmath , we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which means that, locally, @xmath is a Killing vector. @xmath is also
orthogonal to the hypersurface @xmath , and as such this configuration
is static. This property only holds locally (on @xmath ) and we
therefore call this configuration momentarily static .

For @xmath equation ( 3.2.1 ) is automatically satisfied, and ( 3.2.2 )
reduces to the standard @xmath -dimensional flat space Laplace equation,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We impose the following conditions on @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which is the asymptotic flatness condition (remember that @xmath ).

Let @xmath , where the @xmath are arbitrary points in our spacetime. A
solution to equation ( 3.2.5 ) is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the @xmath are arbitrary constants. Note that equation ( 3.2.7 )
obeys the condition ( 3.2.6 ). The spatial metric takes the form (recall
that the conformal metric @xmath is flat)

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This solution is asymptotically flat (by construction), and if we
compare this expression with ( 3.2.4 ), we can identify @xmath , which
is the mass parameter measured in the “principal sheet” (anticipating
the interpretation).

We now have to analyse what happens as @xmath , for a given @xmath .
When @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . Setting the origin of our coordinate
system at @xmath ( @xmath ) we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and when @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where we defined @xmath . With the coordinate transformation @xmath we
have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This shows that in this limit the space is also asymptotically flat.
Thus, our solution ( 3.2.8 ) describes a space with @xmath
asymptotically flat regions. Note that all “lower sheets” are separate,
i.e., there is no way to travel from one sheet to the other except
through the “upper sheet” (or “principal sheet”). Equation ( 3.2.9 )
shows that each sheet, asymptotically, has a Schwarzschild-Tangherlini
form, with the mass measured in the @xmath th sheet being given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The observer located on the principal sheet (the ( @xmath )th sheet) is
the only one that sees a system of @xmath black holes, with total mass
@xmath , as we had already mentioned. Thus we identify @xmath and
rewrite our expressions in terms of @xmath ,

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

where @xmath and @xmath . The points @xmath are called punctures .

Note that @xmath . This difference can be attributed to the interaction
energy between the black holes. It is important to note that @xmath , as
we have defined it, is just a convenient label for the mass of the
@xmath th black hole (but is not the mass). The mass of the @xmath th
black hole as measured on the @xmath th sheet (its “bare mass”), is
given by @xmath . ¹ ¹ 1 There seems to be some mismatch in the
literature as to the definition of “bare mass”. Brill and Lindquist [
Brill:1963yv ] clearly define it as @xmath , in our notation, and they
even point out that the sum of the bare masses is different from the
total mass. However, Brandt and Brügmann [ Brandt:1997tf ] seem to
define bare mass as @xmath .

#### 3.2.2 Bowen-York initial data

Brill-Lindquist initial data is very useful because it provides us with
an analytical solution for the constraint equations. However, it also
has little physical relevance. Generally, one is interested in solutions
with black holes that are spinning and moving and as such
Brill-Lindquist data is clearly not enough.

In order to have a more general configuration, i.e. one that is not
momentarily static, we cannot impose @xmath . Let us recall that our
assumptions are: @xmath —the maximum slicing condition; @xmath is
flat—the conformal flatness condition; and @xmath —the asymptotic
flatness condition.

We now start by writing @xmath in the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

By construction, @xmath , and we impose @xmath . We will also restrict
ourselves to the case @xmath . The equations ( 3.2.1 ) and ( 3.2.2 )
take the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.13)
     @xmath      (3.2.14)
     @xmath      (3.2.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Thus, we have to solve ( 3.2.13 ), plug @xmath in ( 3.2.15 ) and then
solve ( 3.2.14 ). We will see that, even though we will be able to
solve ( 3.2.13 ) analytically, we generally have to use numerical
methods to solve ( 3.2.14 ).

To solve ( 3.2.13 ) we make the following decomposition [ Yoshino:2006kc
] , which introduces functions @xmath and @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Equation ( 3.2.13 ) then gets the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which is solved if

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We have reduced our problem to solving two flat space Laplace equations,
which have known analytical solutions. In the following we analyse some
possible solutions [ Yoshino:2006kc ] .

##### Moving black holes

We start by choosing a solution for the system ( 3.2.17 ) of the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

@xmath stands for the area of the @xmath -dimensional hypersphere.
@xmath are constants that, as we shall see, will be the linear momentum
of the black hole in the @xmath direction.

For such an ansatz we have, from equation ( 3.2.16 ),

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath , and from equations ( 3.2.15 ) and ( 3.2.12 )

  -- -- -- ----------
           (3.2.20)
  -- -- -- ----------

The ADM linear momentum is given by [ Bowen:1980yu , Yoshino:2006kc ,
Gourgoulhon:2007ue ]

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where we perform the integration on a hypersphere at infinity; @xmath
denotes the induced metric on the hypersphere—using spherical
coordinates @xmath (we can write the induced metric on a hypersphere
@xmath of radius @xmath as @xmath , and thus @xmath ); @xmath is its
unit normal vector.

Reminding ourselves that

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

we see that we can calculate the ADM linear momentum without knowing
@xmath . Plugging ( 3.2.20 ) into ( 3.2.21 ) we have that @xmath , as
expected.

Finally, we note that, as the equation ( 3.2.1 ) is linear, we can
superimpose @xmath solutions of the type ( 3.2.21 ) corresponding to
@xmath Schwarzschild black holes,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath and the parameters @xmath correspond to the ADM momentum of
the @xmath th black hole when the separation of the holes is very large.

##### Spinning black holes

Let us now try a solution of ( 3.2.17 ) of the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath will be the angular momentum tensor of the black hole. We
have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The ADM angular momentum is given by (when @xmath ) [ Bowen:1980yu ,
Yoshino:2006kc , Gourgoulhon:2007ue ]

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We can check that @xmath .

For @xmath we can define the angular momentum vector in the usual way,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.28)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As in the previous section, we can now superimpose @xmath solutions of
the type ( 3.2.26 ),

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.30)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The parameters @xmath correspond to the ADM angular momentum of the
@xmath th black hole when the separation of the holes is very large.

##### General case

We can now combine the results from the two previous sections to build a
solution of @xmath black holes with arbitrary linear momentum and spin,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.31)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath and @xmath are given by equations ( 3.2.23 ) and ( 3.2.30
).

  Note:  

    This solution reduces to the Brill-Lindquist momentarily static
    solution ( @xmath ) when @xmath . For @xmath , @xmath and @xmath ,
    however, we do not have a slice of a Kerr (or, for the
    higher-dimensional case, Myers-Perry) spacetime. It has actually
    been shown [ Garat:2000pn ] that there is no foliation of the Kerr
    spacetime that is axisymmetric, conformally flat, and reduces
    smoothly to the Schwarzschild solution in the non-rotating limit. ²
    ² 2 For the four-dimensional Kerr solution, but there is no reason
    to believe that the higher-dimensional case is any different. This
    means that our Bowen-York solution with @xmath does represent a
    rotating black hole, but not a stationary one. For the
    four-dimensional case, when we evolve the data, the system emits
    gravitational radiation and eventually settles down to the Kerr
    solution [ Brandt:1994db , Gleiser:1997ng ] (the higher-dimensional
    case has not been studied as of yet). This spurious gravitational
    radiation has no desirable physical properties and is often referred
    to as “junk radiation”.

##### Conformal factor

We still need to solve equation ( 3.2.14 ) to get the full initial data,
and now there is no hope of finding an analytical solution. Let us
rewrite the equation we need to solve,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.32)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with @xmath given by ( 3.2.31 ).

Along the lines of [ Brandt:1997tf ] and [ Yoshino:2006kc ] we write

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.33)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.34)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Equation ( 3.2.32 ) then takes the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.35)
  -- -------- -- ----------

For the four-dimensional case, Brandt and Brügmann [ Brandt:1997tf ]
were able to show the existence and uniqueness of @xmath solutions for
the above equations. Furthermore, the solution for @xmath is found on an
Euclidean manifold; we do not need to impose inner boundary conditions
to avoid singularities. Brandt and Brügmann also show that this solution
is the “natural” generalisation of the Brill-Lindquist initial data,
i.e., each puncture represents the infinity of another asymptotically
flat region of the spacetime and there is no way to travel from one
sheet to the other except through the “upper” sheet. The
higher-dimensional case has not been thoroughly studied, but it is
believed that the situation is not radically different [ Yoshino:2006kc
] .

### 3.3 Final remarks

In this chapter we introduced tools for the construction of initial data
for higher-dimensional numerical relativity. As we mentioned, even
though the four-dimensional case has been thoroughly studied, the study
of initial data for higher-dimensional systems started only very
recently. As of yet, only Brill-Lindquist and Bowen-York initial data
have been generalised, but with these two approaches one is already able
to construct quite interesting systems for vacuum spacetimes. In
particular, the Bowen-York approach allows us to write initial data for
spacetimes with an arbitrary number of moving and spinning black holes.

For the four-dimensional case there are also powerful computer codes to
solve the elliptic equation ( 3.2.35 ), such as the spectral method
presented by Ansorg et al. [ Ansorg:2004ds ] .

In upcoming chapters we will present a generalisation of the spectral
solver in [ Ansorg:2004ds ] that solves ( 3.2.35 ) for black hole
binaries in @xmath dimensions with non-vanishing initial boost, and
preserves the spectral convergence properties observed in four
dimensions.

## Chapter 4 Numerical implementation

In chapter 2 , we have written Einstein’s field equations explicitly in
a form (usually referred to as ADM equations ( 2.6.3 )) which one could
easily give to a computer to evolve. As can be seen from this system of
equations, though, we are still not quite ready to perform numerical
evolutions: we still need to say what happens with the variables @xmath
(lapse) and @xmath (shift). The Einstein equations have not imposed any
evolution equation for these variables. This reflects our coordinate
freedom: fixing the lapse function and shift vector is a gauge choice,
which one could in principle do arbitrarily. In turns out, though, that
a good choice is crucial to achieve a stable numerical integration. We
will in this chapter briefly discuss why this is the case and write down
the equations we will be using throughout this work.

It also turns out, as researchers eventually found out empirically in
the 1990s when full three-dimensional evolutions were attempted using
the ADM equations, that this system of evolution equations is not well
suited to obtain long-term stable numerical simulations. This is now
known to be due to the fact that the ADM equations are only weakly
hyperbolic. ¹ ¹ 1 The ADM equations do allow stable evolutions in
spherical symmetry, though (see e.g. [ Alcubierre:2008 ] ). People
started experimenting with reformulations of the ADM equations and in
1998 Baumgarte and Shapiro—revisiting an earlier formulation based on
conformal transformations by Nakamura, Oohara and Kojima [
Nakamura:1987zz ] and Shibata and Nakamura [ Shibata:1995we ] —showed
that this formulation behaved much better than ADM for all cases
considered [ Baumgarte:1998te ] . This formulation became known as BSSN
(Baumgarte, Shapiro, Shibata and Nakamura) and is today the most popular
scheme used to evolve Einstein’s equations.

It was later realised that indeed the BSSN scheme can be shown to be
strongly hyperbolic, as opposed to only weakly hyperbolic like in the
ADM case, and thus well-posed, e.g. [ Sarbach:2002bt , Yoneda:2002kg ] .

We should also mention that other successful evolution schemes do exit.
Most notably, the generalised harmonic coordinates approach, e.g. [
Friedrich:1996hq ] , was successfully used by Pretorius in the first
ever evolutions of binary black holes through several orbits [
Pretorius:2005gq ] . Giving a full overview of such topics falls outside
of the scope of this work. We will in this chapter merely introduce the
BSSN evolution equations and we refer the interested reader to, e.g., [
Alcubierre:2008 , baumgarte2010numerical ] for comprehensive overviews.

We close this chapter by introducing the numerical code itself used for
all the simulations to be presented.

In this chapter, we restrict ourselves to the four-dimensional case (for
completeness, we present in appendix 4.A the higher-dimensional BSSN
scheme), and therefore spatial (Latin) indices are here restricted to
@xmath .

### 4.1 BSSN formulation

As we have just mentioned, if we were to try and evolve Einstein’s
equations in the ADM formulation ( 2.6.3 ) (supplemented with the gauge
conditions we will introduce in the next section) we would find out that
the system is severely unstable. In this section we recast the evolution
equations in the BSSN form, which allows for stable numerical
evolutions.

We start by performing a conformal decomposition of the spatial metric
@xmath in the following way (observe it is going to be a different
decomposition from the one performed in the study of the initial data)

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The conformal factor @xmath can in principle be freely prescribed. In
the BSSN scheme, one imposes that the determinant of the conformal
metric be equal to the determinant of the flat metric @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

By construction, we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Since we will stick to Cartesian coordinate systems throughout this
work, we will always have @xmath , which makes @xmath a scalar density
with weight @xmath .

Just like in equation ( 3.1.4 ), we decompose the extrinsic curvature
@xmath into trace and trace-free parts and apply the conformal
transformation we used for the metric to the traceless part,

  -- -- -- ---------
           (4.1.4)
  -- -- -- ---------

Let us now find evolution equations for the variables we have introduced
( @xmath ). Inserting ( 4.1.1 ) and ( 4.1.4 ) into ( 2.6.3a ) and (
2.6.3b ) we have, taking the trace,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where in this last equation we have already used the constraint ( 2.6.3c
) to eliminate the Ricci scalar. Substituting back we can compute the
remaining evolution equations, which take the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (4.1.8)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath denotes the trace-free part, e.g., @xmath .

We further need to decompose the Ricci tensor in two parts,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath only depends on @xmath and @xmath is the Ricci tensor
associated with the metric @xmath . This term contains mixed second
derivatives of the metric, something that is undesirable. For stable
numerical integration, the following “conformal connection” variable was
introduced [ Shibata:1995we , Baumgarte:1998te ]

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In terms of this conformal connection, the conformal Ricci tensor then
takes the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As we can see, the first term in this expression, which involves a
Laplacian, is the only explicit second order derivative operator acting
on @xmath . All the mixed second derivatives have been absorbed in
derivatives of @xmath . Since the BSSN scheme considers @xmath to be an
independent variable, we need an evolution equation for it. Acting on (
4.1.10 ) and interchanging the time and space derivatives we get

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We further use the momentum constraint ( 2.6.3d ) to do away with the
divergence of the extrinsic curvature and obtain

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (4.1.13)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

The full system of evolution equations is then

  -- -------- -------- -- -----------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.1.14a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.1.14b)
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (4.1.14c)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.1.14d)
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (4.1.14e)
  -- -------- -------- -- -----------

where @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath            (4.1.15)
              @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- ----------

Source terms are determined by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.1.16)
              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

The above system of evolution equations ( 4.1.14 ) is known as the BSSN
evolution scheme and has proven to be extremely robust for numerical
evolutions of Einstein’s field equations. Numerous other schemes do
exist; most, however, offer no substantial advantage over BSSN, which
has remained extremely popular. We will use BSSN for all our numerical
evolutions.

### 4.2 Gauge conditions

We now turn our attention to the gauge conditions. The first question to
ask is: what is a “good” choice for @xmath and @xmath ? An obvious first
choice, also the simplest possible, is to impose the so-called geodesic
slicing (also known as Gaussian normal coordinates ),

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This choice was in fact used in the pioneering work by Hahn and
Lindquist [ 1964AnPhy..29..304H ] ; it is now known, however, that it is
actually a very bad choice for long-term evolutions. We can intuitively
understand why this is the case. First we note from equation ( 2.2.6 )
that the Eulerian observers have zero acceleration and thus follow
geodesics (hence the name of this slicing). In the presence of black
holes (or other gravitational sources), geodesics tend to focus.
Coordinate observers will then collide with each other, consequently
forming coordinate singularities and crashing the numerical evolution.
We thus need better gauge choices. It falls outside the scope of this
work to give an overview on the merits and disadvantages of the
different conditions that have been proposed throughout the years. We
will simply state and motivate the conditions we will be using.

#### 4.2.1 1+log slicing

A famous choice for the lapse function is known as maximal slicing ,
which corresponds to imposing that the trace of the extrinsic curvature
vanishes throughout the evolution,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

A nice property of this condition is its singularity avoidance . We can
see this by taking the trace of equation ( 2.1.18 ), which with ( 4.2.2
) implies @xmath , an incompressibility condition on the velocity field
of the Eulerian observers. This prevents the observers from converging
and the subsequent appearance of a coordinate singularity, as in the
geodesic slicing case. Such a property is very much desirable, making
maximal slicing an attractive choice. There is an enormous disadvantage,
however, which is the need to solve an elliptic equation at every time
step during the numerical evolution in order to ensure ( 4.2.2 ). We
therefore would like to have conditions that mimic this property of
maximal slicing, yet with a hyperbolic character.

Such a choice is the so-called 1+log slicing ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which, being a hyperbolic equation, is trivial to implement numerically,
has been shown to be extremely robust and mimics the singularity
avoidance properties of maximal slicing [ Anninos:1995am ] .

This condition gets its name from the fact that, when imposing @xmath ,
equation ( 4.2.3 ) can be integrated to give

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where we recall that @xmath .

#### 4.2.2 Gamma driver

Having chosen a condition for the lapse function, it remains then to say
what happens to the shift.

A possible choice, known as the Gamma freezing condition, is the
following

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Using equation ( 4.1.14e ), we can write the above condition as an
elliptic equation for @xmath . This condition is related to the “minimal
distortion” shift condition [ Smarr:1977uf ] , which attempts to choose
coordinates such that the time derivative of the 3-metric @xmath is
minimised. The disadvantage is once again the need to solve an elliptic
equation at each time step.

Researchers have therefore proposed alternative conditions, using
parabolic or hyperbolic equations, that mimic the minimal distortion
condition with good approximation. The following choice (and variations
thereof) is now extremely popular

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a function of spacetime. This is known as the Gamma
driver condition [ Alcubierre:2002kk ] .

Use of these gauge choices proved crucial for the 2005 breakthroughs
using the moving puncture technique [ Campanelli:2005dd , Baker:2005vv ]
.

### 4.3 Numerical code

Having chosen a set of evolution equations ( 4.1.14 ), gauge
conditions ( 4.2.3 ), ( 4.2.6 ) and prescriptions for setting initial
data (see chapter 3 ), it remains then to assemble everything on a
numerical code. Such a task is far from trivial. One of the main reasons
is that the presence of very different scales in the spacetimes that are
usually evolved requires the use of mesh refinement . The problem is
further complicated by the need to use parallel computing and to store
large amounts of data.

All numerical simulations that will be presented in subsequent chapters
have been performed by adapting the Lean code [ Sperhake:2006cy ] ,
initially designed for @xmath vacuum spacetimes by U. Sperhake. Lean is
based on the Cactus computational toolkit [ cactus ] , it employs the
BSSN formulation of the Einstein equations [ Shibata:1995we ,
Baumgarte:1998te ] (with fourth order discretisation in the spatial
derivatives) with the moving puncture method [ Campanelli:2005dd ,
Baker:2005vv ] , uses the Carpet package for Berger-Oliger mesh
refinement [ Schnetter:2003rb , carpet ] , the spectral solver described
in [ Ansorg:2004ds ] for @xmath initial data and Thornburg’s
AHFinderDirect [ Thornburg:1995cp , Thornburg:2003sf ] for horizon
finding (see section 5.2 ).

For a given numerical simulation our numerical grid will consist of two
types of cubic refinement levels: @xmath outer levels centred on the
origin (remaining stationary throughout the simulation), and @xmath
inner levels centred around each black hole (and following these as the
simulation progresses). The following notation (which we will make
frequent use of)

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

specifies a grid with six fixed outer components of “radius” @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath respectively and two
refinement levels with two components each with radius @xmath and @xmath
centred around either black hole. The resolution is @xmath on the finest
level and successively decreases to @xmath on the outermost level.
Further details about Lean may be found in [ Sperhake:2006cy ] .

## Appendix 4.A @xmath-dimensional BSSN equations

For completeness, we here write the full @xmath -dimensional BSSN
equations, as first written in [ Yoshino:2009xp ] . These equations can
be derived in a procedure entirely analogous to the one outlined in
section 4.1 .

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.A.1a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.A.1b)
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (4.A.1c)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.A.1d)
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (4.A.1e)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath denotes the trace-free part and the Ricci tensor @xmath is
further split into @xmath , where

  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath            (4.A.2)
              @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------

Equations ( 4.1.14 ) can be recovered with @xmath .

## Chapter 5 Wave extraction and horizon finding

We have thus far covered, essentially, all the main tools necessary to
successfully evolve Einstein’s equations on a computer. Assuming then
that we can specify some arbitrary initial configuration and evolve it
for as long as we like, we are still faced with the most important task:
how to extract the relevant physical information. Recalling that the
coordinate system used throughout the evolution is designed to be well
suited to the numerical evolution and not for human-readability, we
easily convince ourselves that it is not trivial to read physical
information from the numerical output. For this purpose, tools were
developed to enable the extraction of the gravitational wave information
from a numerical simulation and, when dealing with black hole
spacetimes, information about the black hole’s horizon.

In this chapter we will briefly outline the two main methods of
extracting gravitational wave information and the corresponding
waveforms: the gauge invariant formalism of Kodama and Ishibashi [
Kodama:2000fa , Kodama:2003jz ] —itself a generalisation to
higher-dimensional spacetimes of the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli formalism [
Regge:1957td , Zerilli:1970se ] , later put in a gauge-invariant form by
Moncrief [ Moncrief:1974am ] —and the Newman-Penrose formalism [
Newman:1961qr ] . We will also mention the very basics regarding finding
(apparent) black hole horizons.

### 5.1 Wave extraction

Gravitational waves are ripples in the shape of spacetime that propagate
information at finite speed, just as water waves are ripples in the
shape of an ocean’s surface. They are one of the most important
predictions of general relativity. These waves have never been directly
detected; there is, however, strong indirect evidence for its existence
since the discovery of the famous binary pulsar PSR 1913+16 (also known
as the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar after its discoverers [ Hulse:1974eb ]
), whose orbital period change is consistent with the general
relativistic prediction for energy loss via gravitational wave emission.
Other systems have since been uncovered, allowing for even more
stringent tests, e.g. [ Lyne:2004cj , Kramer:2009zza ] .

These waves are generated by dynamical gravitational fields---roughly
speaking, accelerated bodies in non-spherically symmetric motion will
emit gravitational waves ¹ ¹ 1 For a system to emit gravitational waves
the third time derivative of its quadrupole moment has to be non-zero. .
As they propagate throughout spacetime, they carry with them information
about the physical properties of the system that produced them. By
measuring them with gravitational wave detectors—such as the already
mentioned LIGO, Virgo, GEO and TAMA—we can have a brand new window
opening up to the universe. The likelihood of such detections is greatly
enhanced if one can use theoretical gravitational wave signals coming
from possible astrophysical sources as templates. Our task here is to
briefly introduce the techniques used to generate such templates from
numerical simulations.

Before we begin, let us make one last comment. We have mentioned energy
carried away by gravitational radiation, but as we know there is no
notion of local energy of a gravitational field, so some care has to be
taken here. The usual procedure is to write a stress-energy tensor for
the metric fluctuations that is second-order in said fluctuations (the
same way that the stress-energy tensor associated with a scalar or
electromagnetic field is second order in the fields). Modulo some
subtleties, such a quantity can be constructed, and meaningful
quantities can be extracted from it. We will not be giving details on
its derivation or the subtleties involved (see, e.g., [ Isaacson:1967zz
, Isaacson:1968zza , Misner:1974qy ] ), but merely present the relevant
formulæ that will be of use to us.

We will start by recalling known four-dimensional results that will be
of use. In the weak-field limit, we can write the metric tensor as the
Minkowski metric plus perturbations,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

To first order in @xmath , the Riemann tensor is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It is useful to introduce the usual trace reversed perturbation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Imposing the Lorenz gauge

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

the linearised field equations reduce to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the d’Alembertian operator in flat space. In vacuum we
get the usual wave equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Since the Lorenz gauge does not completely fix our degrees of freedom,
we can further impose the transverse-traceless (TT) gauge

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where, to simplify, we can use a Cartesian coordinate system @xmath and
@xmath is a unit timelike vector. The second equation reflects the fact
that there is no propagating scalar mode in general relativity. Note
that in this gauge @xmath . With the constraints ( 5.1.4 ) and ( 5.1.7 )
we are left with two degrees of freedom (in four dimensions;
generically, in @xmath -dimensions, we have @xmath degrees of freedom).
We can write the plane-wave solution of equation ( 5.1.6 ) subject to
the constraints ( 5.1.7 ) in the usual form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

taking @xmath and where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

@xmath and @xmath are the two independent polarisations of the
gravitational wave, known as “plus” and “cross” polarisations.

It can be shown (e.g. [ Misner:1974qy , Carroll:2004st ,
baumgarte2010numerical ] ) that the outgoing energy flux carried by the
gravitational radiation is given by

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.10)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

To derive this formula, we need to expand Einstein’s equations up to
second order perturbations. Terms that are quadratic in the first order
perturbations of the metric, after suitable averaging, can then be
viewed as sources, constituting an effective stress-energy tensor for
gravitational waves. This stress-energy tensor can then be used to
compute energy and momentum carried away by the gravitational radiation.

#### 5.1.1 Newman-Penrose formalism

We now briefly describe the Newman-Penrose formalism. This formalism
(also known as the spin-coefficient formalism ) introduced by Newman and
Penrose in 1962 [ Newman:1961qr ] is an alternative way to write
Einstein’s equations which has proven to be extremely useful in many
situations in general relativity, such as in searches of exact
solutions, black hole perturbation theory and studies of gravitational
radiation. There is a whole literature devoted to this formalism. For
its application in numerical simulations, we mention for instance the
books by Alcubierre [ Alcubierre:2008 ] , Baumgarte & Shapiro [
baumgarte2010numerical ] and references therein. Here we will only state
the basic equations that we will need and refer the reader to relevant
publications where appropriate.

In this section we restrict ourselves to four-dimensional spacetimes
since this formalism has not been generalised to higher dimensions. ² ²
2 A related formalism also based on spin-coefficients, the
Geroch-Held-Penrose (GHP) [ Geroch:1973am ] formalism, has been extended
to higher dimensions [ Durkee:2010xq ] .

This formalism starts with introducing a null complex tetrad @xmath
satisfying

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the complex conjugate of @xmath and all other inner
products vanish.

We further note that the four-dimensional Riemann tensor @xmath has 20
independent components. Its trace, the Ricci tensor @xmath has 10. The
remaining degrees of freedom are encoded in the Weyl tensor @xmath ,
defined as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The Newman-Penrose formalism encodes these degrees of freedom in a set
of complex scalars, often called Newman-Penrose scalars . The ten
independent components of the Weyl tensor are encoded in the five
complex scalars @xmath (often also called Weyl scalars ). ³ ³ 3 The ten
independent components of the Ricci tensor are analogously written in
terms of four scalars and three complex scalars, but we will never make
use of these quantities in this work. All of these scalars are formed by
contracting the Weyl tensor (and the Ricci) with the complex null
tetrad. Since there is no unique choice for a null tetrad satisfying (
5.1.11 ), the choice of this tetrad will affect the Weyl scalars and
their physical interpretation.

For a class of such tetrads, the so-called quasi-Kinnersley frames ,
@xmath and @xmath both vanish, and we can interpret @xmath and @xmath as
measures of the incoming and outgoing gravitational radiation, whereas
@xmath can be interpreted as the “Coulombic” part. @xmath and @xmath are
defined as ⁴ ⁴ 4 Different sign conventions exist in the literature.

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.13)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.14)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

Since (for the suitable tetrad we mentioned above) the latter quantity
encodes the outgoing gravitational wave signal, this will be of
particular use to us ( @xmath will also be of use in section 7.2 ).

In practice, we construct @xmath , @xmath and @xmath from an orthonormal
triad @xmath orthogonal to the unit timelike vector @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath            (5.1.15)
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- ----------

We refer the reader to [ Lehner:2007ip ] for a review of the formalism;
here we merely note that asymptotically the triad vectors @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath behave as the unit radial, polar and azimuthal vectors.

Having chosen our tetrad, we can now compute an explicit expression for
@xmath using the definition ( 5.1.14 ). In the TT gauge, this can be
shown to be, for outgoing waves [ Alcubierre:2008 ,
baumgarte2010numerical ]

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.16)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.17)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

whereas for ingoing waves, we have instead

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.18)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.19)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath denotes a time derivative and @xmath and @xmath are the
amplitudes of the plus and cross polarisation of the gravitational
wave ( 5.1.8 ), ( 5.1.9 ). Herein lies the usefulness of the @xmath
scalar.

It is useful to perform a multipolar decomposition by projecting @xmath
onto spherical harmonics of spin weight @xmath (cf., e.g., appendix D of
[ Alcubierre:2008 ] ):

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.20)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

In terms of these multipoles, the radiated flux is given by the
expressions [ Newman:1961qr , Newman:1981fn ]

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.21)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

In Einstein-Maxwell theory, the right-hand-side of Einstein’s equations
reads

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the Maxwell-Faraday tensor. In such cases, we can
analogously extract the electromagnetic wave signal in the form of the
scalar functions, @xmath and @xmath [ Newman:1961qr , Newman:1981fn ] ,
defined as

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.23)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.24)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

For outgoing waves at infinity, these quantities behave as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Again, it is useful to perform a multipolar decomposition by projecting
@xmath and @xmath onto spherical harmonics of spin weight @xmath and
@xmath respectively:

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.26)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.27)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

In terms of these multipoles, the radiated flux is given by the
expressions [ Newman:1961qr , Newman:1981fn ]

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.28)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

We see from ( 5.1.25 ) that @xmath encodes the radiative modes.

#### 5.1.2 Kodama-Ishibashi

A different approach to extract gravitational wave perturbations is that
of the gauge-invariant Moncrief formalism [ Moncrief:1974am ] . This has
been generalised to higher dimensions by Kodama and Ishibashi (KI) [
Kodama:2000fa , Kodama:2003jz ] , and we will review this approach in
the following.

In the KI formalism, we start by writing the metric element as a
background metric plus a perturbation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The background spacetime has the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.30)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the @xmath coordinates refer to the whole spacetime ( @xmath ),
@xmath and @xmath is the metric on the unit @xmath -sphere @xmath .

The procedure now is to expand the metric perturbations @xmath into
harmonic functions. These exist in three flavours—scalar, vector and
tensor harmonics. Metric perturbations can then be written in terms of
gauge invariant quantities [ Kodama:2000fa ] :

  Tensor harmonics @xmath  

    satisfy

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (5.1.31)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    with the properties

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (5.1.32)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    where @xmath is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on @xmath and @xmath
    denotes the covariant derivative with respect to the metric @xmath
    on the sphere. Note that we will omit the index labelling the
    harmonic throughout this discussion.

    For tensor-type perturbations, the metric perturbations @xmath are
    expanded in the following way

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (5.1.33)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    where @xmath (again, we leave the harmonic labels implicit), and
    note that there is sum over the indices of the harmonics in this
    expression.

  Vector harmonics @xmath  

    satisfy

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (5.1.34)
         @xmath      (5.1.35)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    from this, vector-type harmonic tensors can further be defined

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (5.1.36)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    We expand the vector-type perturbations as

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (5.1.37)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    where @xmath .

  Scalar harmonics @xmath  

    satisfy

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (5.1.38)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    from which we can build scalar-type vector harmonics

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (5.1.39)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    and scalar-type harmonic tensors

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (5.1.40)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    We expand scalar-type perturbations as

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (5.1.41)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    where @xmath .

    For @xmath , the metric perturbations can be expressed in terms of
    the following gauge-invariant variables [ Kodama:2000fa ]

      -- -------- -------- -------- ----------
         @xmath   @xmath            (5.1.42)
                  @xmath   @xmath   
      -- -------- -------- -------- ----------

    where we have defined

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (5.1.43)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    and we denote the covariant derivative with respect to the metric
    @xmath with a subscript @xmath .

Impressively, a master function @xmath can be defined that, from the
perturbed Einstein equations, can be shown to obey the simple wave
equation [ Kodama:2003jz ]

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.44)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the d’Alembertian operator with respect to @xmath , and
the form of the potential @xmath depends on whether one is considering
scalar, vector or tensor perturbations.

The master function @xmath is specially useful since it encodes the
gravitational waveform; the energy emitted via gravitational radiation
can also be computed quite effortlessly. Writing the index @xmath
explicitly, the energy flux in each @xmath -multipole is [ Berti:2003si
]

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.45)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The total energy emitted in the process is then

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.46)
  -- -------- -- ----------

### 5.2 Horizon finding

When evolving black hole spacetimes, besides the wave extraction tools,
physical information can also be read from its horizon properties. A
black hole is a region of spacetime from which no future directed null
geodesic can reach an outside observer. Its surface, the event horizon ,
acts therefore as a one-way membrane. In asymptotically flat spacetimes,
the event horizon can be defined as the boundary of the causal past of
future null infinity. It is thus as global concept, requiring
information from the whole spacetime to be located. From the point of
view of a numerical evolution, this is not very useful since one would
like to know about the location of the black hole as the simulation
progresses.

A more useful concept in this regard is that of the apparent horizon .
It is defined as the outermost marginally trapped surface on a given
spatial hypersurface—a closed surface on which the expansion of
(outgoing) null geodesics vanishes. The apparent horizon is a local
concept, depending only on information present on the given
hypersurface, making it an ideal diagnostic tool for numerical
evolutions.

Given a spatial section @xmath of a spacetime with 3-metric @xmath and
extrinsic curvature @xmath , the expansion of null geodesics can be
shown to be

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the covariant derivative with respect to the 3-metric
@xmath and @xmath is the spatial normal to the apparent horizon surface
within @xmath . @xmath is the expansion of the outgoing null geodesics,
@xmath the expansion of the ingoing ones. The (black hole) apparent
horizon is then defined by the following equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

General purpose tools exist to solve this equation during numerical
evolutions; for an overview see e.g. [ Thornburg:2006zb ] and references
therein.

Finally, we emphasise that apparent horizons are slicing dependent. It
is possible, for instance, to foliate the Schwarzschild spacetime in
such a way that there is no apparent horizon [ Wald:1991zz ] (the event
horizon, being a global quantity, is an intrinsic property of the
geometry and is thus always present). The presence of an apparent
horizon, however, does imply the existence of a section of an event
horizon exterior to it (assuming cosmic censorship and @xmath for all
null @xmath [ wald1984general ] ).

## Chapter 6 Higher-dimensional numerical relativity

As mentioned in the Introduction, the ability to perform fully
non-linear numerical evolutions of Einstein’s field equations in
higher-dimensional scenarios has tremendous potential to answer
fundamental questions in physics, with possible applications including
studies of the AdS/CFT duality, explorations of TeV-gravity scenarios
and the study of higher-dimensional black hole solutions.

Numerical relativity in higher dimensions has only recently started
being explored, with pioneering works including those in [
Choptuik:2003qd , Yoshino:2009xp , Zilhao:2010sr , Shibata:2010wz ,
Witek:2010xi ] . In this chapter, we will describe the approach of [
Zilhao:2010sr , Witek:2010xi ] .

The formalism we will present allows us to consider two classes of
models, which are generalisations of axial symmetry to higher
dimensional spacetimes: a @xmath dimensional vacuum spacetime with an
@xmath isometry group, and a @xmath dimensional vacuum spacetime with an
@xmath isometry group. The former class allows studies of head-on
collisions of non-spinning black holes. The latter class allows to model
black hole collisions with impact parameter and with spinning black
holes, as long as all the dynamics take place on a single plane. This
class includes the most interesting physical configurations relevant to
accelerator—and cosmic ray—physics (in the context of TeV-scale
gravity), and to the theoretical properties of higher-dimensional black
objects (such as stability and phase diagrams).

In section 6.1 , we introduce a general dimensional reduction procedure
from @xmath -dimensional vacuum general relativity to a lower dimension
model; in section 6.2 we specialise the equations obtained to the case
where the @xmath -dimensional spacetime has an @xmath isometry group,
perform the 3+1 splitting of space and time and write down a system of
evolution equations; in section 6.3 we outline the construction of
relevant initial data, following the approach of [ Zilhao:2011yc ] ; in
section 6.4 , we discuss some code tests, introduce a wave extraction
procedure and present results. We end this chapter with a discussion in
6.5 .

We note that in this chapter, due to the necessity of introducing
multiple covariant derivatives, we shall explain the notation as we go
along.

### 6.1 Dimensional reduction

The starting point of our formalism is a dimensional reduction from
@xmath -dimensional general relativity in vacuum to a lower dimensional
model.

The isometry group of a Schwarzschild (or, for @xmath , Tangherlini [
Tangherlini:1963bw ] ) black hole is @xmath . For a head-on collision of
two non-rotating black holes, the isometry is further reduced to @xmath
: indeed, neither the time direction nor the direction of the collision
correspond to symmetries, but a rotation of the remaining @xmath spatial
directions leaves the spacetime invariant.

One can take advantage of this symmetry to reduce the spacetime
dimensionality. This can be accomplished by writing Einstein’s equations
in @xmath dimensions in a coordinate system which makes the symmetry
manifest, allowing for a lower dimensional interpretation of the @xmath
-dimensional Einstein’s equations (in the spirit of the Kaluza-Klein
reduction). We remark, however, that we do not perform a
compactification; rather, we perform a dimensional reduction by
isometry, as first proposed by Geroch [ Geroch:1970nt ] . The extra
dimensions manifest themselves in the lower dimensionality as a source
of Einstein’s equations, defined on the lower dimensional manifold.

In the original proposal of Geroch [ Geroch:1970nt ] the symmetry space
was @xmath . This approach has been applied to numerical relativity, see
for instance [ Sjodin:2000zd , Sperhake:2000fe , Choptuik:2003as ] ; a
five dimensional extension, with the same symmetry space, has been
derived in [ Chiang:1985rk ] . A generalisation to coset manifolds (like
the sphere @xmath ) was given by Cho in [ Cho:1986wk , Cho:1987jf ] ,
but in these papers the complete form of Einstein’s equations was not
presented.

Following the approach by Cho [ Cho:1986wk ] , we will start by deriving
the general equations obtained doing a dimensional reduction by
isometry. We will afterwards focus on the isometry group of the @xmath
sphere and present the equations obtained with a dimensional reduction
to four dimensions, as well as their numerical implementation.

#### 6.1.1 General formalism

The most general @xmath -dimensional metric @xmath , @xmath , can be
written in the following form (in the coordinate basis @xmath )

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath and @xmath . @xmath is a scale parameter and @xmath a
coupling constant. This metric is fully general and not an ansatz .

Assume that @xmath admits an @xmath -dimensional isometry @xmath ,
generated by @xmath Killing vector fields which we express as (assuming
@xmath is large enough)

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

@xmath . The Killing vector fields form the Lie algebra of @xmath ,
satisfying

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.3)
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.4)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Defining

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the “dual” form @xmath to the Killing fields @xmath by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we can derive, from ( 6.1.3 ),

  -- -- -------- -------- ---------
        @xmath            (6.1.5)
                 @xmath   
                 @xmath   
  -- -- -------- -------- ---------

where @xmath .

Our goal is to compute the Ricci tensor of metric ( 6.1.1 ), which is
more easily done in a non-coordinate basis. Details of the computation
can be found in appendix 6.A ; here we mention only the final result.

We first define the “covariant derivatives” @xmath and @xmath as

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.6)
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.7)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath            (6.1.8)
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------

and both connections are metric,

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

Note however that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The Ricci tensor of ( 6.1.1 ) is (see appendix 6.A )

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.9)
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (6.1.10)
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (6.1.11)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

and

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (6.1.12)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

These are the expressions we were looking for. Equivalent forms can be
found in [ Chiang:1985rk , Cho:1986wk ] .

#### 6.1.2 Examples

##### @xmath

As a first (trivial) exercise, we can reproduce the standard
Kaluza-Klein expressions. Remember that the Kaluza-Klein metric has the
form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We can easily recover this case from our formalism by making @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath (cf. equations ( 6.1.8
)). Remember also that for the Kaluza-Klein case nothing depends on the
“fifth” dimension, and as such @xmath . We get the usual Kaluza-Klein
expressions,

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

##### @xmath

A more interesting case is performing the dimensional reduction on the
@xmath sphere, @xmath . For such an isometry, the Killing vectors @xmath
, @xmath satisfy

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath are the structure constants of @xmath . Because the fibre
has the minimal dimension necessary to accommodate @xmath independent
Killing vector fields, we may assume without loss of generality that the
Killing vector fields have components exclusively along the fibre:
@xmath . Furthermore, we may normalise the Killing vectors so that they
only depend on the coordinates of the fibre, i.e. @xmath .

Equation ( 6.1.3 ) gives the following conditions

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.15)
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.16)
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.17)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

These expressions can be interpreted either as Lie derivatives of rank-
@xmath tensors defined on the @xmath -dimensional spacetime, or as Lie
derivatives of a rank- @xmath tensor, a vector and a scalar, which are
defined on @xmath .

Together with ( 6.1.14 ), conditions ( 6.1.15 )-( 6.1.17 ) have the
following implications:

-   -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (6.1.18)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    because, from ( 6.1.15 ), @xmath admits the maximal number of
    Killing vector fields and thus must be the metric on a maximally
    symmetric space at each @xmath . Due to ( 6.1.14 ) this space must
    be the @xmath sphere. @xmath denotes the metric on an @xmath with
    unit radius;

-   -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (6.1.19)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    because the Killing vector fields @xmath act transitively on the
    fibre and therefore the base space metric must be independent of the
    fibre coordinates;

-   -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (6.1.20)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    because equation ( 6.1.16 ) is equivalent to

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (6.1.21)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    and there exist no non-trivial vector fields on @xmath for @xmath
    that commute with all Killing vector fields on the sphere.

We write the metric on the sphere as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with @xmath . Our @xmath -dimensional metric has a block diagonal form.
Making @xmath and @xmath in the expressions ( 6.1.9 )-( 6.1.1 ) we get

  -- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath            (6.1.23)
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- ----------

where @xmath and @xmath are the Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar for the
metric ( 6.1.22 ). They evaluate to

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

For @xmath -dimensional vacuum spacetimes @xmath . Using also ( 6.1.24 )
on ( 6.1.23 ) we get two coupled equations,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

These equations can also be obtained from the following action

  -- -- -- ----------
           (6.1.26)
  -- -- -- ----------

Performing the substitution @xmath will be useful for the upcoming
numerical implementation. We get

  -- -- -------- -------- ----------
        @xmath            (6.1.27)
                 @xmath   
  -- -- -------- -------- ----------

For completeness, we write in appendix 6.B the equations of motion
obtained when we write the action ( 6.1.26 ) in the Einstein frame.

### 6.2 Dimensional reduction on a @xmath-sphere and 3+1 split

In the previous section we were considering a dimensional reduction
under the full isometry group of the higher-dimensional spacetime. In
the case of head-on black hole collisions, this would produce a
reduction down to 3 spacetime dimensions. In practice, we are actually
interested in performing a @xmath split of the @xmath dimensional
spacetime. This may be done as follows. The metric on a unit @xmath may
always be written in terms of the line element on a unit @xmath ,
denoted by @xmath , as follows,

  -- -- -- ---------
           (6.2.1)
  -- -- -- ---------

where @xmath is a polar-like coordinate, @xmath . Now we introduce four
dimensional coordinates, @xmath , @xmath , and define a four dimensional
metric

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

as well as a new conformal factor

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

As we have seen in the previous sections, the most general @xmath
-dimensional metric compatible with @xmath isometry is, for @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The geometry ( 6.2.4 ) has a manifest @xmath symmetry. We will now
perform a dimensional reduction on a @xmath -sphere, which yields, from
the @xmath -dimensional vacuum Einstein equations, a set of @xmath
dimensional Einstein equations coupled to quasi-matter. In cases with
larger symmetry (if @xmath is the full isometry group, for example), the
quasi-matter terms do not contain independent degrees of freedom and
could in principle be fully determined by the @xmath dimensional
geometry. For such cases we could perform the dimensional reduction on a
@xmath -sphere instead (which has the full isometry group @xmath ),
which would yield a @xmath dimensional system. The former method allows,
however, the use of existing numerical codes, with small changes, which
justifies our choice.

The @xmath isometry group allows the study of a large class of black
hole collisions with impact parameter and with spin: the collisions in
which the two black holes always move on the same 2-plane and the only
non trivial components of the spin 2-form are on that same 2-plane—see
figure 6.1 . With our framework we are able, therefore, to describe not
only head-on collisions of spinless black holes but also a class of
collisions for spinning black holes with impact parameter. As follows
from the discussion of ( 6.1.20 ), the ansatz ( 6.2.4 ) describes
general spacetimes with @xmath isometry in @xmath . We remark that the
models with @xmath are actually the most interesting for
phenomenological studies of large extra dimensions models (see for
instance [ Kanti:2004nr ] ).

Taking ( 6.2.4 ) as an ansatz, we see from ( 6.1.26 ) that the @xmath
-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action takes the form (for reasons related
with the numerical implementation, we now use the variable @xmath
instead of the previously used @xmath )

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the @xmath -dimensional Newton’s constant @xmath is related to the
four dimensional one @xmath by the area of the unit @xmath dimensional
sphere: @xmath . Explicitly, the @xmath -dimensional Einstein’s
equations in vacuum yield the following system of four dimensional
equations coupled to a scalar field:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.6)
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.7)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

In these equations, all operators are covariant with respect to the four
dimensional metric @xmath . These could also be obtained from
equations ( 6.1.27 ) with @xmath . The energy momentum tensor is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

With this four dimensional perspective, the usual @xmath split of
spacetime can be performed, as outlined in section 2.5 . As explained
therein, the projection operator @xmath and the normal to the three
dimensional hypersurface @xmath , @xmath ( @xmath ), are introduced

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

as well as the lapse @xmath and shift @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the time coordinate. The four dimensional metric is then
written in the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As usual, we introduce the extrinsic curvature @xmath , which gives the
evolution equation for the @xmath -metric ( 2.6.2 ). Defining the
variable

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

we further get an evolution equation for @xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Using the relation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath denotes now the covariant derivative with respect to the
3-metric @xmath on @xmath , and equation ( 6.2.7 ) we can get an
evolution equation for @xmath . The contraction of equation ( 6.2.14 )
with @xmath , yields

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Noting that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

we obtain

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Noticing also that @xmath , we write

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Moreover, from equation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

we get

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

so that the evolution equation for @xmath is

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (6.2.22)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

Equations ( 6.2.13 ) and ( 6.2 ) are the evolution equations for the
quasi-matter degrees of freedom.

#### 6.2.1 BSSN formulation

For numerical implementation, we write the evolution equations in the
BSSN formulation, as introduced in section 4 . The evolution equations
are those of ( 4.1.14 ) with source terms determined by ( 4.1.16 ) where
the energy momentum tensor is given by equation ( 6.2.8 ). A
straightforward computation shows that

  -- -------- -------- -- -----------
                          
     @xmath               (6.2.23a)
     @xmath               (6.2.23b)
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.23c)
  -- -------- -------- -- -----------

where @xmath is the covariant derivative with respect to @xmath .

Finally, the evolution equations for @xmath and @xmath are

  -- -------- -------- -- -----------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.24a)
     @xmath               (6.2.24b)
  -- -------- -------- -- -----------

As stated before, in the case of head-on collisions of spinless black
holes the full symmetry of the @xmath -dimensional system we want to
consider makes equations ( 6.2.24 ) redundant, by virtue of ( 6.2.3 ).
This allows to determine the quasi-matter degree of freedom in terms of
the three dimensional spatial geometry, at each time slice. The extra
symmetry manifests itself in the fact that @xmath possesses, at all
times, (at least) one Killing vector field. If one chooses coordinates
adapted to this Killing vector field, @xmath , the metric can then be
written in the form ( 6.2.2 ), and then the quasi-matter degree of
freedom can be determined from the spatial geometry by ( 6.2.3 ). In the
numerical implementation, one can either determine, at each time-step,
the scalar field through ( 6.2.3 ), or impose ( 6.2.3 ) only in the
initial data, and then evolve the scalar field using equation ( 6.2.24
). We have implemented the latter method.

### 6.3 Higher-dimensional initial data

Having written our system of evolution equations, we now need to
construct relevant initial data. Building on the results outlined in
chapter 3 (based on [ Yoshino:2005ps , Yoshino:2006kc ] ), we now
present a generalisation of the spectral solver in [ Ansorg:2004ds ]
that generates initial data for black hole binaries in @xmath dimensions
with non-vanishing initial boost [ Zilhao:2011yc ] .

In this section we need to make some changes to our notation. Early
lower case Latin indices @xmath will here extend from @xmath to @xmath ,
late lower case Latin indices @xmath run from @xmath to @xmath and early
upper case Latin indices @xmath from @xmath to @xmath .

#### 6.3.1 Coordinate transformation

We start by recalling, from chapter 3 that, for a system of boosted
black holes, we can solve the momentum constraint equation ( 2.6.3d )
analytically. It remains then to solve equation ( 3.2.35 ), which we
re-write here:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The numerical solution of this equation will be our task in this
section.

First, it is convenient to transform to a coordinate system adapted to
the generalised axial symmetry @xmath in @xmath dimensions and @xmath in
@xmath dimensions as discussed in section 6.2 . For this purpose we
consider the (flat) conformal spatial metric in cylindrical coordinates

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the metric on the @xmath -sphere. Observe that @xmath is
a polar rather than an azimuthal coordinate, i.e. @xmath . Next, we
introduce “incomplete” Cartesian coordinates as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath and @xmath . The @xmath dimensional initial data for the
spatial metric is then

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We can transform the @xmath dimensional Cartesian coordinates @xmath to
the coordinate system @xmath with hyperspherical coordinates @xmath by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Without loss of generality, we can always choose coordinates such that
the black holes are initially located on the @xmath axis at @xmath and
@xmath and have momenta of equal magnitude in opposite directions @xmath
. Inserting the momenta into equation ( 3.2.23 ) then provides the
conformal traceless extrinsic cuvature and the differential equation (
6.3.1 ) which is solved numerically for @xmath .

The class of symmetries covered by the formalism developed in this
chapter includes head-on and grazing collisions of non-spinning black
holes with initial position and momenta

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (6.3.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Note that a non-zero @xmath is not compatible with the assumed
symmetries. On the other hand, the @xmath -axis can always be oriented
such that the collision takes place in the @xmath plane. Our formalism
therefore covers general grazing collisions of non-spinning black hole
binaries in @xmath dimensions.

#### 6.3.2 Four dimensional initial data for a general @xmath head-on
collision

We will now discuss in detail the case of black holes with momenta in
the @xmath direction, that is, the case given by setting @xmath in
equation ( 6.3.6 ). The linear momenta are thus given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The rescaled trace-free part of the extrinsic curvature for such a
configuration is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath and @xmath are given by equation ( 3.2.23 ) with ( 6.3.6 )
and ( 6.3.7 ). Using equation ( 6.3.5 ) we can write this in the
coordinate system @xmath adapted to the spacetime symmetry:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with

  -- -- -- ----------
           (6.3.10)
  -- -- -- ----------

and

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the metric on the @xmath -sphere. The expression for
@xmath is analogous, but with @xmath in place of @xmath and @xmath in
place of @xmath in equation ( 6.3.9 ).

We now need to re-express these quantities in terms of our @xmath
quantities, @xmath , as introduced in the previous section. These are
the variables evolved in time and therefore the variables we ultimately
wish to construct from the initial data calculation. For their
extraction we first note that @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are related to
the @xmath -dimensional metric @xmath and extrinsic curvature @xmath by

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.3.12)
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.3.13)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

Using these relations and equation ( 6.2.4 ) we can express all “3+1”
variables in terms of those describing the initial data

  -- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath            (6.3.14)
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- ----------

where

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The conformal factor is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and @xmath is the solution of the equation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Our numerical construction of the function @xmath will be based on the
spectral solver developed in [ Ansorg:2004ds ] . This solver employs
coordinates specifically adapted to the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath
at spatial infinity. In order to investigate this behaviour, we next
consider a single black hole with non-zero linear momentum.

#### 6.3.3 Single puncture with linear momentum

For a single puncture with momentum @xmath located at the origin @xmath
, equation ( 3.2.23 ) implies

  -- -- -- ----------
           (6.3.19)
  -- -- -- ----------

so that equation ( 6.3.17 ) takes the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

It turns out to be convenient for solving this differential equation to
introduce a hyperspherical coordinate system on the @xmath dimensional
spatial slices, such that the flat conformal metric is

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

with @xmath . We further introduce the radial coordinate

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which reduces to the coordinate @xmath of equation (31) in [
Ansorg:2004ds ] for the case of @xmath spacetime dimensions. Expressed
in the new coordinate system, equation ( 6.3.20 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For @xmath we recover equation (40) of [ Ansorg:2004ds ] . In order to
study the behaviour of the solution at spatial infinity, we now perform
a Taylor expansion in @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Odd powers of @xmath have to vanish in order to satisfy equation (
6.3.22 ). We have the following equation for @xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In order to solve equation ( 6.3.24 ), we make the ansatz

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath . By solving equation ( 6.3.24 ), we find that the
functions @xmath and @xmath take the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (6.3.27)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the hypergeometric function and @xmath are constants to
be fixed by imposing that @xmath and @xmath is smooth. Requiring
analyticity at @xmath and using the property @xmath , we immediately
find @xmath .

We are now interested in the large @xmath limit. Therefore, we use the
@xmath transformation law for the hypergeometric functions [ abramowitz
] ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.28)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Requiring a regular solution we find that @xmath has to satisfy

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Let us write these functions explicitly for @xmath (for @xmath the
hypergeometric function does not simplify):

-   @xmath

      -- -------- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath   @xmath      (6.3.30)
         @xmath   @xmath      (6.3.31)
      -- -------- -------- -- ----------

    These are equations (42–44) in [ Ansorg:2004ds ] , with appropriate
    redefinitions.

-   @xmath

      -- -------- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath   @xmath      (6.3.32)
         @xmath   @xmath      (6.3.33)
      -- -------- -------- -- ----------

-   @xmath

      -- -------- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath   @xmath      (6.3.34)
         @xmath   @xmath      
                  @xmath      (6.3.35)
      -- -------- -------- -- ----------

Analysing these expressions, we can anticipate the convergence
properties of the numerical solutions obtained in terms of
pseudo-spectral methods. For instance, analyticity of @xmath and @xmath
suggests exponential convergence. As will become clear in the next
section, we are interested in the convergence properties in a coordinate
@xmath behaving as @xmath , for large @xmath . We thus introduce a
coordinate @xmath that satisfies

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.36)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In terms of the @xmath coordinate, we find that the functions @xmath are
analytical. For the function @xmath in the vicinity of @xmath , the
leading terms behave as follows:

-   @xmath

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (6.3.37)
      -- -------- -- ----------

-   @xmath

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (6.3.38)
      -- -------- -- ----------

-   @xmath

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (6.3.39)
      -- -------- -- ----------

From the behaviour of the functions @xmath and @xmath and equation (
6.3.25 ) we conclude that the first term in the expansion ( 6.3.23 ) has
a leading-order behaviour @xmath as @xmath . Iteratively solving
equation ( 6.3.22 ) for higher powers of @xmath is complicated by the
presence of the source terms on the right hand side, but under
simplifying assumptions indicates that higher-order terms @xmath acquire
additional factors of @xmath and therefore the leading-order fall off
behaviour is given correctly by that of @xmath . This result is
confirmed by our numerical investigation using finite boost parameters
as we shall discuss in the next section.

With regard to the analyticity of the solutions and the resulting
expectations for the convergence properties of a spectral algorithm, we
summarise the results of our analytical study of a single puncture as
follows. In @xmath , the leading terms are analytic functions in the
vicinity of @xmath . Actually, for @xmath , @xmath is analytic in the
vicinity of any point. Therefore, we expect exponential convergence of
the pseudo-spectral code. For @xmath , one observes the presence of a
logarithmic term. This type of term is known to arise in @xmath , when
punctures have non-vanishing momenta [ Dain:2001ry , Gleiser:1999hw ]
and in that case their presence makes the convergence algebraic in the
single puncture case. In the next section we shall investigate the
impact of the logarithmic terms on the convergence properties of our
spectral solver.

#### 6.3.4 Two punctures with linear momentum

##### Code changes

We first explicitly list the modifications applied to the spectral
solver of reference [ Ansorg:2004ds ] and demonstrate how these
modifications enable us to generate initial data for boosted black hole
binaries with convergence properties and levels of constraint violation
similar to the @xmath case. For this purpose we start by recalling that
the spectral solver of [ Ansorg:2004ds ] employs coordinates

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.40)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which are defined by equation (62) of [ Ansorg:2004ds ] ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.41)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is half of the coordinate distance between the punctures.
In particular, the coordinate @xmath satisfies

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.42)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The first modification consist in adapting the source term and Laplace
operator according to ( 6.3.17 ).

Next, we note that the type of high-energy collisions which form the
main motivation for this work often start from relatively large initial
separations of the holes, @xmath . In order to obtain high-precision
solutions for such binary configurations, we found it crucial to
introduce a coordinate @xmath defined as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.43)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is an adjustable free parameter. Note that for @xmath we
obtain @xmath For @xmath , however, the new coordinate @xmath provides
the spectral method with enhanced resolution near @xmath .

A further modification is related to the asymptotic fall off of the
function @xmath as obtained in the previous section,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.44)
  -- -------- -- ----------

To naturally accommodate this behaviour with the spectral coordinates
used in the code, we have changed the variable @xmath of equation (5) in
[ Ansorg:2004ds ] to

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.45)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Note that this @xmath variable is the variable that the code actually
solves for.

Finally, we adjust the calculation of the ADM mass from the numerical
solution. For this purpose, we note that, asymptotically

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.46)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with @xmath and @xmath . The ADM mass is then obtained from

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (6.3.47)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

where we have used equation (62) of [ Ansorg:2004ds ] , and equation (
6.3.43 ) and ( 6.3.45 ). We show in table 6.1 the values obtained for
the ADM mass of some cases we considered.

##### Results

We now study the numerical results as obtained for @xmath with these
adaptations of the spectral solver of [ Ansorg:2004ds ] . Throughout the
remainder of this section we will graphically present results in units
of the “bare” Schwarzschild radius defined as @xmath .

We first address the convergence properties of the numerical algorithm
by evaluating the quantity

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.48)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the maximum is obtained along the collision axis, i.e. @xmath
-axis in our case. Here, the index @xmath refers to a reference solution
obtained using a large number @xmath of grid points while @xmath denotes
test solutions using a coarser resolution, @xmath . The result obtained
for black hole binaries with initial separation @xmath and boost @xmath
in @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath dimensions is displayed in figure
6.2 . We note from this figure, that achieving a given target accuracy
@xmath requires a larger number of points @xmath as @xmath increases. We
emphasise in this context, however, that this increase in computational
cost in higher dimensions is unlikely to significantly affect the total
computational cost of the simulations which typically are dominated by
the time evolution rather than the initial data calculation. Most
importantly, we observe exponential convergence up to a level of @xmath
for all values of the spacetime dimensionality @xmath . Below that
level, the two leftmost curves in figure 6.2 , corresponding to @xmath
and @xmath , respectively, show that the rate of convergence decreases
indicating that the logarithmic terms become significant and reduce the
convergence to algebraic level similar to the observation in figure 4 of
reference [ Ansorg:2004ds ] . For @xmath , the convergence remains
exponential, in agreement with the absence of logarithmic terms in the
analysis of section 6.3.3 . Irrespective of a change to algebraic
convergence, however, our algorithm is capable of reducing the quantity
@xmath for all values of @xmath to a level comparable to the case @xmath
and, thus, producing initial data of similar quality as in 3+1
dimensions, provided we use a sufficiently high resolution @xmath .

For illustration, we plot in figure 6.3 the function @xmath obtained for
the case of @xmath , @xmath . The behaviour is qualitatively similar for
all values of @xmath , but the figure demonstrates the faster fall off
for larger @xmath as predicted by ( 6.3.44 ). For this plot we have used
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath grid points. The inset in the figure shows
the function @xmath in the immediate vicinity of the puncture. While the
profile develops multiple extrema for @xmath , the profile remains
smooth for all values of @xmath .

Finally, we show in figure 6.4 , the Hamiltonian constraint
corresponding to the solutions presented in figure 6.3 as measured by a
fourth-order finite differencing scheme of the Lean evolution code
(section 4.3 and reference [ Sperhake:2006cy ] ). We emphasise that the
violation of equation ( 6.3.1 ) inside the spectral initial data solver
is @xmath by construction. The independent evaluation of the constraint
violation in the evolution code serves two purposes. First, it checks
that the differential equation ( 6.3.1 ) solved by the spectral method
corresponds to the Hamiltonian constraint formulated in ADM variables;
an error in coding up the differential equation ( 6.3.1 ) could still
result in a solution for @xmath of the spectral solver, but would
manifest itself in significantly larger violations in figure 6.4 .
Second, it demonstrates that the remaining numerical error is dominated
by the time evolution instead of the initial solver. Note in this
context that the relatively large violations of order unity near the
puncture location in figure 6.4 are an artifact of the fourth-order
discretisation in the diagnostics of the evolution code and are typical
for evolutions of the moving-puncture type; see e.g. the right panel in
figure 8 in Brown et al. [ Brown:2008sb ] .

The solid (blue) curve obtained for the “standard” @xmath case serves as
reference. For all values of @xmath the constraint violations are
maximal at the puncture location @xmath and rapidly decrease away from
the puncture. As expected from the higher fall off rate of the grid
functions for larger @xmath , the constraints also drop faster for
higher dimensionality of the spacetime.

### 6.4 Numerical evolutions

Having established that our initial data code is working, we will now
show some numerical results, obtained by adapting the Lean code
introduced in section 4.3 . In this section we will begin by briefly
commenting on numerical issues generated by the quasi-matter terms
arising from the dimensional reduction. We then present some code tests
and results.

From the initial data construction of section 6.3 , we see that the
quasi-matter field @xmath has a @xmath fall off as @xmath , that is, on
the @xmath plane (cf. ( 6.3.14 )). From ( 6.2.23 ), we see that this
leads to divisions by zero on the right-hand side of the BSSN evolution
equations; thus, we need to isolate such irregular terms and re-write
the equations in terms of variables which are explicitly regular at
@xmath . In this spirit, we introduce the following evolution variable

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.4.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and corresponding auxiliary variable

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.4.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The full quasi-matter terms and evolution equations in terms of these
regular variables can be found in Appendices A and B of [ Zilhao:2010sr
] . Here we note only that, with the above definition, we have the
relation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.4.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Finally, for long term evolutions, we employed the following gauge
conditions, which are generalisations of conditions ( 4.2.3 ), ( 4.2.6 )

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.4.4)
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.4.5)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Note the extra term involving @xmath in the slicing condition compared
with standard moving puncture gauge in @xmath dimensions and the
additional freedom we have introduced in the form of the parameters
@xmath and @xmath .

#### 6.4.1 Code tests

##### Geodesic slicing

As a first test of our numerical implementation, we have numerically
evolved a single @xmath Tangherlini black hole in the so-called geodesic
slicing , which corresponds to fixing the gauge parameters to ( 4.2.1 )
throughout the evolution. Such a gauge choice is not adequate to perform
long term numerical evolutions. The advantage of this choice, though, is
that one can easily write the Tangherlini metric element in this
coordinate system, which we can then match against the numerically
obtained solutions [ Yoshino:2009xp ] . This coordinate system may be
achieved by setting a congruence of in-falling radial time-like
geodesics, each geodesic starting from rest at radial coordinate @xmath
, with @xmath spanning the interval @xmath , and using their proper time
@xmath and @xmath as coordinates (instead of the standard @xmath ,
@xmath Schwarzschild-like coordinates). The line element becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.4.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.4.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Before the breaking down of the numerical evolution, we can compare our
numerical results with the above metric element. This is shown in figure
6.5 , where we have plotted one metric component @xmath along the @xmath
axis (left) and @xmath (right), for various values of @xmath using both
the analytical solution and numerical data. The agreement is excellent
for @xmath and good for @xmath . The latter shows some deviations very
close to the puncture, but we believe that it is not a problem for two
reasons: (i) the agreement improves for higher resolution; (ii) the
mismatch does not propagate outside of the horizon.

##### Single black hole evolution

To further test our numerical framework, we have performed long term
simulations of a single black hole in @xmath using the gauge conditions
in ( 6.4.4 ) and ( 6.4.5 ), the initial data from equations ( 6.3.14 )
(with @xmath ) and grid setup (cf. section 4.3 )

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

in units of @xmath with resolutions @xmath and @xmath . In figure 6.6 we
show the Hamiltonian constraint and the @xmath component of the momentum
constraint at evolution time @xmath . For the Hamiltonian constraint the
convergence is essentially 4th order; for the momentum constraint it
decreases towards 2nd or 3rd order in patches.

##### Head-on collision

Finally, we tested the code capability to evolve a head-on collision
from rest. Using again the initial conditions ( 6.3.14 ) with @xmath ,
we let two black holes with parameters

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.4.8)
     @xmath      (6.4.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

collide from rest, using the grid setup

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

in units of @xmath . The gauge variables @xmath and @xmath were evolved
according to equations ( 6.4.4 ) and ( 6.4.5 ) with parameters @xmath
and @xmath .

In figure 6.7 we show the conformal factor @xmath and the momentum
@xmath along the axis of collision at various times for such an
evolution. At early times, the evolution is dominated by the adjustment
of the gauge (cf. the solid and short-dashed curves). The two holes next
start approaching each other (long-dashed and dotted curves) and
eventually merge and settle down into a single stationary hole
(dash-dotted curves). No signs of instabilities were observed.

#### 6.4.2 Head-on collisions

Having established, in the previous section, that our numerical
implementation does work (for the five dimensional case) we will now
present some results.

Since the final result of a head-on collision of two @xmath dimensional,
non-spinning black holes approaches, at late times, a @xmath dimensional
Schwarzschild (i.e. Tangherlini) black hole, we can make use of the
Kodama-Ishibashi formalism, presented in section 5.1.2 to extract the
gravitational wave information. Our remaining task is then to obtain the
relevant gauge-invariant quantities from our numerical data. We will
give here the main steps for this procedure; the full details can be
found in reference [ Witek:2010xi ] .

##### Coordinate frames

In the approach developed in section 6.2 , we perform a dimensional
reduction by isometry on the @xmath -sphere @xmath , in such a way that
the @xmath dimensional vacuum Einstein equations are rewritten as an
effective @xmath dimensional time evolution problem with source terms
that involve a scalar field. We focus here on @xmath dimensional
spacetimes with @xmath isometry group, which allows us to model head-on
collisions of non-spinning black holes; we dub hereafter these
spacetimes as axially symmetric . Although the corresponding symmetry
manifold is the @xmath -sphere @xmath , the quotient manifold in our
dimensional reduction is its submanifold @xmath . The coordinate frame
in which the numerical simulations are performed is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the angles @xmath describe the quotient manifold @xmath and do not
appear explicitly in the simulations. Here, @xmath is the symmetry axis,
i.e. the collision line.

Recall that in the frame ( 6.4.10 ), the spacetime metric has the form
(cf. equation ( 6.2.4 ))

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Also recall, from equations ( 6.2.2 ) and ( 6.2.3 ), that with an
appropriate transformation of the four dimensional coordinates @xmath ,
the residual symmetry left after the dimensional reduction on @xmath can
be made manifest: @xmath ( @xmath ),

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

so that equation ( 6.4.11 ) takes the form @xmath .

To extract the gravitational waves with the KI formalism, spacetime,
away from the black holes, is required to be approximately spherically
symmetric. In @xmath dimensions this means symmetry with respect to
rotations on @xmath , which is manifest in the coordinate frame:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Note that @xmath and that we have introduced polar-like coordinates
@xmath to “build up” the manifold @xmath in the background, together
with a radial spherical coordinate @xmath , which is the areal
coordinate in the background.

The coordinate frame ( 6.4.14 ) is defined in such a way that the metric
can be expressed as a stationary background @xmath (i.e., the
Tangherlini metric) plus a perturbation @xmath which decays faster than
@xmath for large @xmath , and the formalism from section 5.1.2 can thus
be applied [ Witek:2010xi ] .

##### Implementation of axisymmetry

In an axially symmetric spacetime, the metric perturbations are
symmetric with respect to @xmath . Therefore, the harmonics in the
expansion of @xmath depend only on the angle @xmath (which does not
belong to @xmath ). Furthermore, since there are no off-diagonal terms
in the metric, the only non-vanishing @xmath components are @xmath ; the
only components @xmath are either proportional to @xmath , or all
vanishing but @xmath . This implies that only scalar spherical harmonics
can appear in the expansion of the metric perturbations. Indeed, if

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

then equation ( 5.1.35 ) gives

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Similarly, from equation ( 5.1.32 ) we obtain @xmath .

The scalar harmonics, solutions of equation ( 5.1.38 ) and which depend
only on the coordinate @xmath , are given by the Gegenbauer polynomials
@xmath , as discussed in references [ Berti:2003si , Cardoso:2002ay ,
Yoshino:2005ps ] ; writing explicitly the index @xmath , they take the
form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the normalization @xmath is chosen such that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and @xmath .

Metric perturbations, and corresponding gauge-invariant functions, can
then be computed in terms of these functions [ Witek:2010xi ] .

##### Extracting gravitational waves

In the KI framework, the emitted gravitational waves are described by
the master function @xmath , cf. section 5.1.2 . We can compute directly
@xmath with [ Kodama:2003jz , Witek:2010xi ] ¹ ¹ 1 Note that there is a
factor @xmath missing in equation (3.15) of reference [ Kodama:2003jz ]
.

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath . The energy flux can then be computed from expressions (
5.1.45 ), ( 5.1.46 ).

#### 6.4.3 Head-on collision from rest in @xmath

Having introduced and tested our formalism and numerical code, we now
present results obtained for head-on collisions of five-dimensional
black holes. The black holes collide from rest, with initial coordinate
separation @xmath . Note that in five spacetime dimensions the
Schwarzschild radius is related to the ADM mass @xmath via

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We therefore define the “total” Schwarzschild radius @xmath such that
@xmath . By using this definition, @xmath has physical dimension of
length and provides a suitable unit for measuring both results and grid
setup.

As summarised in table 6.2 , we consider a sequence of binaries with
initial coordinate separation ranging from @xmath to @xmath . The table
further lists the proper separation @xmath along the line of sight
between the holes and the grid configurations used for the individual
simulations.

##### Newtonian collision time

An estimate of the time at which the black holes “collide” can be
obtained by considering a Newtonian approximation of two point particles
in @xmath . The Newtonian time it takes for two point-masses (with
Schwarzschild parameters @xmath and @xmath ) to collide from rest with
initial distance @xmath in @xmath dimensions is given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath and

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

For @xmath , one recovers the standard result @xmath whereas for @xmath
we get

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In general relativity, black hole trajectories and merger times are
intrinsically observer dependent quantities. For our comparison with
Newtonian estimates we have chosen relativistic trajectories as viewed
by observers adapted to the numerical coordinate system. While the lack
of fundamentally gauge invariant analogues in general relativity
prevents us from deriving rigorous conclusions, we believe such a
comparison to serve the intuitive interpretation of results obtained
within the “moving puncture” gauge. Bearing in mind these caveats, we
plot in figure 6.8 the analytical estimate of the Newtonian time of
collision, together with the numerically computed time of formation of a
common apparent horizon. Also shown in the figure is the time at which
the separation between the individual hole’s puncture trajectory
decreases below the Schwarzschild parameter @xmath .

The remarkable agreement provides yet another example of how well
numerically successful gauge conditions appear to be adapted to the
black hole kinematics.

##### Waveforms

Let us now discuss the gravitational wave signal, extracted with the KI
formalism, generated by the head-on collision of two black holes in five
dimensions.

In figure 6.9 , the @xmath multipole of the KI function @xmath for model
HD5e obtained at different extraction radii is plotted. A small spurious
wavepulse due to the initial data construction is visible at @xmath ,
the so-called “junk radiation”. The physical part of the waveform is
dominated by the merger signal around @xmath , followed by the
(exponentially damped) ringdown, whereas the infall of the holes before
@xmath does not produce a significant amount of gravitational waves.
Comparison of the waveforms extracted at different radii demonstrates
excellent agreement, in particular for those extracted at @xmath and
@xmath . Extrapolation of the radiated energy to infinite extraction
radius yield a relative error of 5 % at @xmath , indicating that such
radii are adequate for the analysis presented in this work.

Due to symmetry, no gravitational waves are emitted in the @xmath
multipole, so that @xmath represents the second strongest contribution
to the wave signal. As demonstrated in the right panel of figure 6.9 ,
however, its amplitude is two orders of magnitude below that of the
quadrupole.

In order to assess how accurately we are thus able to approximate an
infall from infinity, we have varied the initial separation for models
HD5a to HD5f as summarised in table 6.2 . As demonstrated in figure 6.10
, for models HD5e and HD5f we can safely neglect the spurious radiation
as well as the impact of a finite initial separation, provided we use a
sufficiently large initial distance @xmath of the binary. Here, we
compare the radiation emitted during the head-on collision of black
holes starting from rest with initial separations @xmath and @xmath .
The waveforms have been shifted in time by the extraction radius @xmath
and such that the formation of a common apparent horizon occurs at
@xmath . The merger signal starting around @xmath shows excellent
agreement for the two configurations and is not affected by the spurious
signal visible for HD5e at @xmath .

We conclude this discussion with an analysis of the ringdown. After
formation of a common horizon, the waveform is dominated by an
exponentially damped sinusoid, as the merged hole rings down into a
stationary state. By fitting our results with an exponentially-damped
sinusoid, we obtain a characteristic frequency

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This value is in excellent agreement with perturbative calculations,
which predict a lowest quasinormal frequency @xmath for @xmath [
Cardoso:2003qd , Yoshino:2005ps , Berti:2009kk ] .

##### Radiated energy

We now compute the energy flux from the KI master function via
equation ( 5.1.45 ). The fluxes thus obtained for the @xmath multipole
of models HD5e and HD5f in table 6.2 , extracted at @xmath , are shown
in figure 6.11 . As in the case of the KI master function in figure 6.10
, we see no significant variation of the flux for the two different
initial separations. The flux reaches a maximum value of @xmath , and is
then dominated by the ringdown flux. The energy flux from the @xmath
mode is typically four orders of magnitude smaller; this is consistent
with the factor of 100 difference of the corresponding wave multipoles
observed in figure 6.9 , and the quadratic dependence of the flux on the
wave amplitude. Integrating, we find that a fraction of @xmath of the
centre of mass energy is emitted in the form of gravitational radiation.
We have verified for these models that the amount of energy contained in
the spurious radiation is about three orders of magnitude smaller than
in the physical merger signal.

### 6.5 Discussion

In this chapter we have presented a framework that allows the
generalisation of the present generation of 3+1 numerical codes to
evolve, with relatively minor modifications, spacetimes with @xmath
symmetry in @xmath dimensions and @xmath symmetry in @xmath dimensions.
