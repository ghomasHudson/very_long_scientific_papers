ensures the existence of such 4-manifold. Moreover by the following
Proposition 2.1.15 , one such manifold is unique up to diffeomorphism.
The proof of the reconstruction theorem consists of an explicit
construction of the 4-manifold that is based on the division of the
shadow in regions and 1-skeleton like in this paragraph.
