The first attempts at solving a binary black hole spacetime date back to
the 1960s, with the pioneering works of Hahn and Lindquist. In spite of
all the computational advances and enormous efforts by several groups,
the first stable, long-term evolution of the orbit and merger of two
black holes was only accomplished over 40 years later, in 2005. Since
then, the field of Numerical Relativity has matured, and been
extensively used to explore and uncover a plethora of physical phenomena
in various scenarios.

In this thesis, we take this field to new frontiers by exploring its
extensions to higher dimensions, non-asymptotically flat spacetimes and
Einstein-Maxwell theory. We start by reviewing the usual formalism and
tools, including the “3+1” decomposition, initial data construction, the
BSSN evolution scheme and standard wave extraction procedures. We then
present a dimensional reduction procedure that allows one to use
existing numerical codes (with minor adaptations) to evolve
higher-dimensional systems with enough symmetry, and show corresponding
results obtained for five-dimensional head-on collisions of black holes.
Finally, we show evolutions of black holes in non-asymptotically flat
spacetimes, and in Einstein-Maxwell theory.
