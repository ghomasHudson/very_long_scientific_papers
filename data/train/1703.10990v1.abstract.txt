In this thesis, we obtain the formula for the Kac determinant of the
algebra arising from the level @xmath representation of the
Ding-Iohara-Miki algebra. This formula can be proved by decomposing the
level @xmath representation into the deformed @xmath -algebra part and
the @xmath boson part, and using the screening currents of the deformed
@xmath -algebra. It is also discovered that singular vectors obtained by
its screening currents correspond to the generalized Macdonald
functions. Moreover, we investigate the @xmath limit of five-dimensional
AGT correspondence. In this limit, the simplest 5D AGT conjecture is
proved, that is, the inner product of the Whittaker vector of the
deformed Virasoro algebra coincides with the partition function of the
5D pure gauge theory. Furthermore, the R-Matrix of the Ding-Iohara-Miki
algebra is explicitly calculated, and its general expression in terms of
the generalized Macdonald functions is conjectured.
