Motivated by Zirnbauer [ Zir 1996 ] , we develop a theory of Riemannian
supermanifolds up to a definition of Riemannian symmetric superspaces.
Various fundamental concepts needed for the study of these spaces both
from the Riemannian and the Lie theoretical viewpoint are introduced,
e.g.Â geodesics, isometry groups and invariant metrics on Lie supergroups
and homogeneous superspaces.
