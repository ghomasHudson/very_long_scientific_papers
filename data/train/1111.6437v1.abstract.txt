This thesis treats several topics in the study of extra-dimensional
models of the world, concerning Heterotic M-Theory and the dynamics of
branes.

We describe a reduction to five dimensions, over a Calabi-Yau manifold,
of an improved version of Heterotic M-Theory, which is valid to all
orders in the gravitational coupling. This provides a starting point for
considering the consequences of the improved theory for the very
fruitful phenomenology of the original.

We investigate the singularities formed by the collision of gravitating
branes in scalar field theory. By considering the asymptotic structure
of the spacetime, the properties of the horizons formed and the growth
of the curvature we argue that the singularity is not a black brane, as
one might have expected, but rather a big crunch.

Finally, we construct a restricted class of multi-galileon theories as
braneworld models with codimension greater than one, developing in the
process some of the formalism needed for the general construction.
