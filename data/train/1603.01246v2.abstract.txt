A distance on a set is a comparative function. The smaller the distance
between two elements of that set, the closer, or more similar, those
elements are. Fréchet axiomatized the notion of distance into what is
today known as a metric. In this thesis we study several generalizations
of Fréchet’s axioms. These include partial metric, strong partial
metric, partial @xmath etric and strong partial @xmath etric. Those
generalizations allow for negative distances, non-zero distances between
a point and itself and even the comparison of @xmath tuples. We then
present the scoring of a DNA sequence, a comparative function that is
not a metric but can be modeled as a strong partial metric.
Using the generalized metrics mentioned above we create topological
spaces and investigate convergence, limits and continuity in them. As an
application, we discuss contractiveness in the language of our
generalized metrics and present Banach-like fixed, common fixed and
coincidence point theorems.
