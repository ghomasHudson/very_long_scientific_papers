Transmission system operators need to adapt their decision-making tools
to the technological evolutions of the twenty first century. A
computation inherent to most tools seeks to find alternating-current
power flows that minimize power loss or generation cost. Mathematically,
it consists in an optimization problem that can be described using only
addition and multiplication of complex numbers. The objective of this
thesis is to find global solutions, in other words the best solutions to
the problem. One of the outcomes of this highly collaborative doctoral
project is to use recent results from algebraic geometry to compute
globally optimal power flows in the European high-voltage transmission
network.
Keywords: polynomial optimization, semidefinite optimization, optimal
power flow, Lasserre hierarchy
