In this chapter we reviewed some theoretical elements of modern
cosmology in order to explain how the Dark Matter problem has emerged in
the last century. Based on modern observations, we discussed the various
probes and evidences of the presence of a non-relativistic Dark Matter
component representing @xmath of the energy budget of the universe and
its impact on structure formation. We discussed various possibilities to
account for this missing mass issue, in particular in the context of the
WIMP freeze-out scenario. In the last chapter of this first part, we
discussed the current status of standard searches for Dark Matter which
aim at observing DM-SM scatterings, annihilations or direct production
of DM. In the following part we propose some phenomenological solutions
to the Dark Matter problem based on the WIMP paradigm, from the studies
of simplified Dark Matter models to more ellaborate constructions
motivated by particle physics considerations. In the last part we
explore more complex scenarios involving alternative Dark Matter
production mechanisms.
