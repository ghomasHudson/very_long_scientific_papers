This thesis describes the first detailed studies of trapped metastable (
@xmath -state) H. Recent apparatus enhancements in the MIT Ultracold
Hydrogen group have enabled the production of clouds of at least @xmath
magnetically trapped @xmath atoms at densities exceeding @xmath cm
@xmath and temperatures below 100 @xmath K. At these densities and
temperatures, two-body inelastic collisions between @xmath atoms are
evident. From decay measurements of the @xmath clouds, experimental
values for the total two-body loss rate @xmath are derived: @xmath cm
@xmath /s at 87 @xmath K, and @xmath cm @xmath /s at 230 @xmath K. These
values are in range of recent theoretical calculations for the total
@xmath - @xmath inelastic rate constant. Experimental upper limits for
@xmath , the rate constant for loss due to inelastic @xmath - @xmath
collisions, are also determined. As part of the discussion and analysis,
results from numerical simulations to elucidate @xmath spatial
distributions, evolution of the @xmath cloud shape, and fluorescence
behavior in the magnetic trap are presented. This work serves as a
bridge to future spectroscopy of trapped metastable H with the potential
to test quantum electrodynamics (QED) and improve fundamental constants.
