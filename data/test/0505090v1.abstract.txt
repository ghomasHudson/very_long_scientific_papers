remains a conjecture. A formal proof would take a titanic effort, but
some steps towards that end have been taken in simple cases [ 15 ] .
Each method has its advantages and drawbacks. Compactification, while
intuitive, easier to deal with and having all the machinery of
differential geometry to help characterizing the compactification
manifolds, has problems in going beyond simple calculations. It also
feels unnatural to impose a specific geometry on which to quantize
strings, when the strings themselves create geometry. The algebraic
method on the other hand, while being quite abstract and shedding little
light as to what is going on, makes however explicit stringy
calculations feasible.

It is the purpose of this book to deepen the understanding of the
internal conformal field theory by studying examples and checking the
strict consistency requirements they must obey.
