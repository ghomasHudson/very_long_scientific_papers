Flow cardinality estimation is the problem of estimating the number of
distinct elements in a data flow, often with a stringent memory
constraint. It has wide applications in network traffic measurement and
in database systems. The virtual LogLog algorithm proposed recently by
Xiao, Chen, Chen and Ling estimates the cardinalities of a large number
of flows with a compact memory. The purpose of this thesis is to explore
two new perspectives on the estimation process of this algorithm.
Firstly, we propose and investigate a family of estimators that
generalizes the original vHLL estimator and evaluate the performance of
the vHLL estimator compared to other estimators in this family.
Secondly, we propose an alternative solution to the estimation problem
by deriving a maximum-likelihood estimator. Empirical evidence from both
perspectives suggests the near-optimality of the vHLL estimator for
per-flow estimation, analogous to the near-optimality of the HLL
estimator for single-flow estimation.
