#### 6.1.2 Action of the algebra on 1-particle and two particle states

According to the nested Bethe Ansatz construction which was explained in
the first chapter, a generic one-particle state is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
                       @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.14)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The action of the symmetry algebra on this state is given by ( 6.1.1 )
if to identify the field @xmath with the markers @xmath in ( 6.1.1 ) and
the field @xmath with @xmath or @xmath [ 165 ] . Notice an unusual
property of the symmetry algebra: its action changes the length of the
spin chain.

In the basis @xmath the representation ( 6.1.1 ) rearranges into
four-dimensional blocks. The action of the generators on @xmath is the
same as in ( 6.1.1 ) except for the replacements:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

The second replacement plays an important role for the case of two and
more particles and in particular leads to a nontrivial coproduct
structure. Indeed, a generic two-particle state can be written as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
                       @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.16)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Therefore

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

As a consequence, the action of the generators that change the number of
@xmath -s contain an additional factor @xmath . In particular, the
co-product of @xmath is given by [ 214 , 9 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

To put the coproduct in the symmetric form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

one should impose

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are two arbitrary parameters.

We see that the representation becomes dependent on the momentum @xmath
of the particle.

Equivalently, the action of @xmath is given by @xmath . From the
shortening condition we obtain the expression for C:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

In view of ( 6.1 ) and ( 5.14 ), the energy of the magnon should be
identified with @xmath . Therefore ( 6.21 ) can be seen as the
dispersion relation.

The constant @xmath cannot be fixed using the properties of the @xmath
algebra. However, the dispersion relation ( 6.21 ) was derived in [ 10 ]
using a different approach. Based on [ 10 ] it is possible to identify
@xmath with the coupling @xmath defined by ( 5.11 ).

###### Parametrization.

Using rescaling of basis vectors in ( 6.1.1 ) we can always adjust the
constants @xmath to fulfill the following two criteria. First, we demand
that @xmath . We can even put @xmath , however for the reasons explained
below @xmath should be kept explicitly. Second, we demand @xmath . Using
these restrictions, the constants @xmath are uniquely parameterized as:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.22)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The parameter @xmath is fixed by the shortening condition ( 6.13 ) which
implies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

We should choose the solution with the property: @xmath when @xmath .

We see that the representation is uniquely defined by the momentum of
the particle @xmath and the coupling constant @xmath .

###### Hopf algebra picture.

In the Hopf algebra picture, proposed for the AdS/CFT scattering matrix
in [ 214 ] , for each particle with momentum @xmath we associate the
representation @xmath with the coefficients @xmath given by ( 6.22 ).
The coefficient @xmath should be equal for all particles and may be put
to @xmath .

The coproduct is nontrivial for @xmath and is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.24)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The two-particle wave function is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath -matrix should satisfy

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this notation @xmath matrix acts on two @xmath -dimensional
representations:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Twisted picture

The Hopf product becomes the standard one if we redefine the value of
@xmath . Before scattering we will put @xmath and @xmath . After
scattering it will be opposite @xmath , @xmath . In this picture the
@xmath -matrix is invariant under the standard coproduct:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

but the representations of the particles before scattering are different
from the representations of the particles after scattering:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.29)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

##### 6.1.3 Zhukovsky parameterization

Let us introduce two parameters @xmath and @xmath defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

The shortening condition ( 6.23 ) is then expressed as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

This equation defines an algebraic curve which is a torus. A useful
parameterization, not uniform however, for the torus is given in terms
of the parameter @xmath defined by:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

Let us define the Zhukovsky map @xmath by the relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then the parameters @xmath and @xmath are the double-valued functions of
@xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

A choice of the branches of these functions is constrained by the demand
that the @xmath limit should be smooth. If momentum of the particle is
real at all values of the coupling constant then smooth @xmath limit
implies that @xmath . The region defined by @xmath is usually called the
physical region.

The parameter @xmath is an equivalent of the rapidity in the Heisenberg
ferromagnet and for @xmath coincides with it. Let us show the
coincidence on the example of the energy:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the limit @xmath we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is a correct expression for the energy of the XXX magnon ( 1.19 ).

##### 6.1.4 Scattering matrix

When central charges do not obey any shortening condition, a minimal
dimension of an irrep of @xmath algebra is @xmath . In general position
the three central charges of the tensor product of two short irreps do
not obey a shortening condition. Therefore the tensor product of two
four-dimensional representations of the @xmath algebra is in general
position an irreducible representation. Thus the @xmath -matrix can be
fixed up to a scalar factor from symmetry constraints.

The matrix elements of scattering matrix obtained in Hopf algebra
formulation differ from those obtained in twisted picture by a phase.
This is due to the different choice of the parameter @xmath and
therefore a basis redefinition. Different choices of @xmath distinguish
@xmath -matrix obtained from the Hopf algebra formulation, @xmath
-matrix obtained from a Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra [ 15 ] , and
@xmath -matrix of the Hubbard model [ 166 ] . In the following we deal
with the @xmath -matrix which is used for construction of a wave
function 6.25 .

The structure of the @xmath -matrix is quite involved. It can be found
in the original work of Beisert [ 165 ] . Here we will give the @xmath
invariant formulation of the scattering matrix presented in [ 165 ] .

The infinite dimension representation ( 6.1.1 ) is decomposed into
four-dimensional blocks if we consider the action of the @xmath
subalgebra. This subalgebra is constructed from the generators @xmath
and the central charge @xmath . The commutation relations of @xmath
algebra are recovered after the following identification with the
generators of Sec. 4.1 :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath                        (6.38)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The subspace @xmath is invariant under the action of the @xmath
subalgebra and forms the typical irrep @xmath with @xmath . The tensor
product of two such irreps of @xmath is decomposed into direct sum of
three representations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

of dimension @xmath , 8, and 4 respectively.

The scattering matrix is given by the sum of the projectors on these
representations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

The scattering matrix has two special points. When @xmath , the
scattering matrix reduces to the @xmath . When @xmath the scattering
matrix reduces to @xmath . These properties of the scattering matrix
allow performing the fusion procedure as it was in the case of rational
R-matrices. In particular, the transfer matrices constructed from fused
@xmath satisfy Hirota equation as a function of @xmath on a fat hook
shape of @xmath algebra.

#### 6.2 Beisert-Staudacher asymptotic Bethe Ansatz

The asymptotic Bethe Ansatz was proposed by Beisert and Staudacher [ 11
] before the full factorized @xmath -matrix was found. Later it was
rigorously derived based on the knowledge of the @xmath -matrix ( 6.40 )
and using the coordinate nested Bethe Ansatz [ 9 , 212 ] and the
algebraic Bethe Ansatz [ 166 ] . It is given by the following set of
equations:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
                       @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.41)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The notations here are the following:

1.  The parameter @xmath , @xmath counts the number of Bethe roots of
    the @xmath -th type.

    The relation between @xmath , @xmath and the charges @xmath , @xmath
    defined by ( 5.28 ) is given by the following formulas:

      -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.42)
      -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

2.  The functions @xmath , @xmath are defined through the Zhukovsky map
    by

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.43)
      -- -------- -- --------

    supplemented by the condition @xmath . This condition is natural for
    the central roots @xmath since the energy is expressed through this
    roots by

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.44)
      -- -------- -- --------

    and it should have a proper @xmath limit. However, the condition
    @xmath is somehow artificial for the Bethe roots of type @xmath .
    Indeed, up to the replacement @xmath the first equation coincides
    with the third one. Therefore it is possible to unite the equations
    for the roots of type @xmath and @xmath into one if to not impose
    constraints on the choice of the branch for @xmath . The same is
    true for the roots of type @xmath and @xmath .

3.  The Bethe equations describe the spectrum of the single trace
    operators. Since the shift of all nodes by one does not change the
    single trace operator due to the cyclicity of the trace, the overall
    momentum of the spin chain should obey a constraint

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.45)
      -- -------- -- --------

4.  The factor @xmath was introduced in [ 42 ] . It is equal to @xmath
    when the fermionic excitations obey periodic boundary conditions and
    to @xmath when the boundary conditions are antiperiodic. For the
    AdS/CFT case the boundary conditions are such that

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.46)
      -- -------- -- --------

    We could in principle cancel out the factor @xmath and the terms
    @xmath in the Bethe Ansatz. However we do not make this cancelation
    since the Bethe Ansatz equations in the form ( 6.41 ) are valid even
    if the condition ( 6.45 ) is not satisfied.

5.  The explicit form of the scalar factor @xmath will be given in the
    next section after the crossing equations that determine @xmath are
    solved.

To finish the description of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz a map between
the configuration of Bethe roots and single trace operators should be
given. A graphical answer to this question is presented in Fig.1 of [
215 ] . Here we will focus on the two simplest examples discussed in the
previous chapter: @xmath and @xmath sectors of the theory.

The @xmath sector is spanned by the operators ( 5.16 ). This sector is
described by the Bethe equations ( 5.23 ) which are recovered from (
6.41 ) by putting @xmath . Number @xmath of fields @xmath is equal to
@xmath , number of fields @xmath is equal to @xmath , @xmath .

The @xmath sector is spanned by the operators of type ( 5.18 ). In this
case the length of the spin chain is equal to the number of the fields
@xmath , @xmath . Number of covariant derivatives acting on one field
@xmath is interpreted as the number of excitation of the corresponding
node. Each covariant derivative corresponds to a complex ⁴ ⁴ 4 This
complex is not a string-like configuration. All Bethe roots are real. of
three Bethe roots: one bosonic root of type @xmath , one fermionic root
of type @xmath , and one fermionic root of type @xmath . Therefore the
total number @xmath of excitations is equal to @xmath , the parameters
@xmath are equal to zero. In view of ( 6.42 ) the AdS charge @xmath is
equal to @xmath .

Instead of writing three types of Bethe equations for three types of
Bethe roots it is possible to perform a duality transformation on the
fermionic roots and get only one type of Bethe equations. For @xmath it
is the same duality transformation that was discussed in section 4.4 .
Its generalization exists for the case @xmath [ 9 ] . We depicted in
Fig. 6.3 the Dynkin diagrams which correspond to the Bethe equations (
6.41 ) and dual transformed Bethe equations.

After the duality transformation the @xmath sector is described by the
following set of Bethe equations:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 6.3 Crossing equations

##### 6.3.1 Sketch of derivation

The scalar factor @xmath which appears in the Beisert-Staudacher
asymptotic Bethe Ansatz cannot be fixed from the continuous symmetries
of the system. The same situation happens in the bootstrap approach for
the relativistic theories (see chapter 2 ). However, in relativistic
theories there are also discrete symmetries which lead to the existence
of antiparticles. From these symmetries additional functional equations
(crossing equations) on the scattering matrix can be derived. These
equations together with an assumption on the physical spectrum of the
theory and unitarity condition unambiguously fix the scalar factor [ 7 ]
.

Although the light-cone quantized string theory is not relativistically
invariant and the presence of discrete symmetries is not evident, it was
argued by Janik [ 16 ] that one can hope to have a kind of the crossing
equations on the scattering matrix ( 6.40 ). Janik derived such crossing
equations assuming that, written in a general algebraic form, they are
the same as the ones for the relativistic theories. This general form is
the following ⁵ ⁵ 5 Strictly speaking, ( 6.48 ) is not the crossing
equations used in a relativistic theory. Equation ( 6.48 ) is derived
from the crossing equations and the unitarity condition. :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath , @xmath is a symmetry algebra, and @xmath is the
antihomomorphism of the symmetry algebra.

On the level of the representation @xmath , the action of the antipode
@xmath on an arbitrary generator @xmath is realized as:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a representation (for anitparticles) which is in general
different from @xmath , @xmath is a charge conjugation (intertwining)
matrix and @xmath means supertransposition ⁶ ⁶ 6 we need to perform
transposition since @xmath is an antihomomorphism. .

For the case of the @xmath @xmath -matrix ( 6.40 ) the representation
@xmath is the four dimensional representation of the centrally extended
@xmath algebra defined by the parameters @xmath .

The equation ( 6.48 ), realized on the representation @xmath , is a
matrix equation on the scattering matrix ( 6.40 ) in which only a single
scalar factor is not fixed. The demand that this equation holds fixes
unambiguously @xmath and @xmath . This was done in [ 16 ] under the
condition that @xmath .

The representation @xmath is parameterized by @xmath which are related
to @xmath of @xmath via the substitution

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

This substitution leads to the change of sign for the energy and the
momentum. Note that the representation @xmath is not contained in any
tensor product of @xmath . Therefore the antiparticles are not
excitations of the asymptotic spin chain. This is an important
difference with compact representations in the nonsupersymmetric case.
This difference was discussed in chapter 4 .

The existence of @xmath and @xmath consistent with ( 6.48 ) is a
nontrivial fact which supports the conjecture of the existence of the
crossing equations for the scattering matrix ( 6.40 ). After
identification of @xmath and @xmath the crossing equations lead to the
following equation on the scalar factor @xmath in ( 6.41 ) [ 16 , 216 ]
:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

Let us explain the meaning of the superscript @xmath . We consider the
dressing factor @xmath as a multivalued function of @xmath . The
spectral parameter @xmath defines @xmath , and therefore the parameters
@xmath of the representation, by the relation @xmath (see ( 6.34 )). The
superscript @xmath means that the first particle in the @xmath -matrix
should be in the @xmath representation, i.e. we should use the
replacement ( 6.50 ). This replacement is realized as the analytical
continuation of @xmath along the contour @xmath in the @xmath -plane ⁷ ⁷
7 The monodromy over @xmath also leads to ( 6.50 ). But the solution of
crossing equation with such monodromy seems to be pathological if one
requires analytical properties of the dressing factor natural for the
physical theory. The situation is opposite in the mirror theory. If to
require analytical properties of the scattering matrix natural for the
mirror theory, the crossing equation with the monodromy over @xmath is
the right one. Its solution is the ”improved” dressing phase of [ 213 ]
as we discuss in appendix C . . This contour is depicted in Fig. 6.4 .
It encircles the branch points @xmath . The dressing factor @xmath has a
nontrivial monodromy along the contour @xmath as it is seen from the
equations ( 6.51 ).

In principle, it is possible to resolve both branch cuts @xmath and
@xmath using an elliptic parameterization [ 16 ] . In terms of the
elliptic variable @xmath used in [ KSV1 ] and related to the one of [ 16
] by a Gauss-Landen transformation the crossing transformation is given
by @xmath . However, as we will see below, the dressing phase has not
two but infinitely many cuts. Therefore the elliptic parameterization
for the dressing phase is not very useful. We will not use the elliptic
parameterization in this work.

##### 6.3.2 Solution

One can show that the solution of the crossing equation can be fixed
uniquely by the following set of requirements on its analytical
structure [ V3 ] :

-   @xmath can be represented in the following form [ 17 , 216 ] :

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.52)
      -- -------- -- --------

    where @xmath is antisymmetric with respect to the interchange of
    variables: @xmath .

    In the following we will use the functions @xmath and @xmath defined
    by

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.53)
      -- -------- -- --------

-   @xmath is an analytic single-valued function for the physical domain
    @xmath . This domain is the analog of the physical strip @xmath in
    relativistic models. The condition of analyticity can be seen as the
    minimality condition.

-   @xmath as a function of @xmath does not have branch points except
    those that are explicitly required by the crossing equation. The
    required branch points are of the square root type. This is a
    condition of compatibility of the analytical structure of the
    dressing phase and analytical structure of the Bethe equations. It
    can be compared with demand for the S-matrix in relativistic
    theories to be meromorphic function of the rapidity variable @xmath
    .

-   @xmath for @xmath . This asymptotics is compatible with the
    asymptotics of the strong coupling expansion of the dressing phase
    which is known from string theory calculations.

To solve the crossing equation let us first understand how the contour
@xmath looks like in the @xmath plane for the functions @xmath and
@xmath . This contour is shown if Fig. 6.5 .

Since @xmath may not be single-valued in the domain @xmath , it may
happen (and it does) that @xmath as a function of @xmath and @xmath as a
function of @xmath after the continuation @xmath are on different
Riemann sheets of the @xmath plane. To avoid this problem we
analytically continue the crossing equation ( 6.51 ) along the path
@xmath , shown in Fig. 6.4 and Fig. 6.5 .

The crossing equation at the point @xmath is written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath means the analytical continuation of @xmath from the point
@xmath to the point @xmath via the path @xmath .

The r.h.s. of ( 6.54 ) was obtained with the help of the property

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

At the point @xmath , in contradistinction to the point @xmath , we are
allowed to write:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

All four functions @xmath which are used in ( 6.56 ) are on the same
Riemann sheet of the @xmath plane.

We can write ( 6.54 ) in terms of the shift operator as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

The shift operator @xmath is not well defined inside the strip @xmath
since we can cross the cut of @xmath and go to another sheet. To avoid
this ambiguity, we will consider the crossing equation ( 6.57 ) outside
this strip, solve it, and then analytically continue the solution.

The function @xmath as a function of @xmath does not have a branch cut
@xmath . A solution of ( 6.57 ) with this property is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Strictly speaking, this expression should be regularized to have a
precise meaning. However, the regulating terms will cancel for the
complete dressing factor @xmath .

The expression ( 6.3.2 ) can be further simplified if we use the
functions @xmath and the relation @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

The multiplier @xmath does not contribute to ( 6.3.2 ). It is needed for
the consistency with the antisymmetry of @xmath with respect to
interchange @xmath . Indeed, a direct calculation shows that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (6.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

whose logarithm is antisymmetric with respect to @xmath as it should.

By taking the logarithm of ( 6.3.2 ) we get a simple Riemann-Hilbert
problem which is solved by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

with the kernel @xmath defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

The kernel @xmath is constructed to satisfy the following equation:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.62)
  -- -------- -- --------

The subscripts @xmath and @xmath in ( 6.60 ) refer to action of @xmath
on @xmath and @xmath variables respectively.

This solution was chosen among the other possible solutions by the
requirement that @xmath should be analytic for @xmath and @xmath . The
kernel @xmath appears also in the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. We will
discuss this issue in Sec. 6.4 .

The expression ( 6.60 ) can be rewritten in the form proposed by Dorey,
Hofman, and Maldacena [ 217 ] if we rewrite the action of the kernel
@xmath as the integral in the Zhukovsky plane

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.63)
  -- -------- -- --------

and note that the second term does not contribute to the dressing phase.

##### 6.3.3 Analytical structure of the dressing factor

We will discuss now the analytical structure of the factor @xmath as a
function of @xmath . The analytical properties of the whole dressing
factor @xmath can be then easily derived.

On the physical sheet @xmath the function @xmath has only one square
root cut @xmath . Analytical structure of @xmath for @xmath can be seen
from the formula ( 6.3.2 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

We see that in this region @xmath has infinitely many cuts @xmath . In
the product in the l.h.s. of ( 6.64 ) the branches for @xmath are chosen
in a way that @xmath .

If we analytically continue @xmath through one of the cuts @xmath we
will arrive at a new Riemann sheet (the third one in Fig. 6.6 ) which
contains, at the position @xmath , pole if @xmath or zero if @xmath .
This pole/zero was first observed in [ 217 ] . It was shown there that
it does not correspond to any bound state but is due to the specific
properties of Feynman diagrams in two-dimensional theories.

#### 6.4 The kernel @xmath and a shorthand notation for the Bethe
equations

The kernels @xmath that had appeared in the derivation of the dressing
phase appear also explicitly in the context of the Bethe Ansatz
equations. Indeed, one can directly check that ⁸ ⁸ 8 A standard choice
of branches is assumed in ( 6.65 ) for the region @xmath , then
analytical continuation is performed.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.65)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore we get a shorthand notation for the building blocks of the
Bethe equations:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.66)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Using the property ( 6.65 ) and the representation for gamma functions
used in ( 6.3.2 ) one can show that the dressing factor can be
represented in the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

where both the kernel @xmath and @xmath -operator act on @xmath
variable.

We should admit that in ( 6.66 ) and ( 6.67 ) we used the shift operator
in the sense

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.68)
  -- -------- -- --------

that is without performing analytical continuation. In opposite, in such
formulas as ( 3.16 ) we used the shift operator in the sense of
analytical continuation. To avoid ambiguity, the following two rules of
writing and interpreting formulas are applied. First, an expression if
possible should be considered in a region where there is no ambiguity
between two interpretations of the shift operator. For instance in the
case ( 3.16 ) the equation should be defined in the region @xmath , then
it may be analytically continued. Second, if we cannot reach a region
without ambiguities (for example we are required to stay on the real
axis) then expression @xmath is understood in the sense ( 6.68 ). To
explicit the case of analytical continuation we use the notation @xmath
or @xmath , where @xmath corresponds to the analytic continuation from
above the cut and @xmath corresponds to the analytic continuation from
below the cut. As an example see ( 9.20 ) and ( 8.31 ).

Taking into account the remarks about the sense of ( 6.66 ) and ( 6.67
), we can write down the Bethe Ansatz equations ( 6.41 ) in a shorthand
way. For this we introduce seven Baxter polynomials

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.69)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Bethe equations ( 6.41 ) will take the following form:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
                       @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.70)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The given notation is a generalization of ( 1.58 ), however without
introducing string configurations. In the limit @xmath we have also
@xmath and ( 1.58 ) is recovered from ( 6.70 ).

We see that the Bethe equations ( 6.41 ) can be expressed through the
Baxter polynomials in the power of an operator which is a rational
combination of @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath . To compare, analogical
operator in the case of spin chain contains polynomial combination of
@xmath and @xmath and in the case of relativistic integrable models -
rational combination of @xmath and @xmath .

#### 6.5 The kernel @xmath and functional equations.

When we pass to the integral equations we should take logarithm and then
derivative of the Bethe equations. For this purpose it is useful to
introduce the kernel @xmath by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.71)
  -- -------- -- --------

The function @xmath also satisfies ( 6.62 ). The relation between the
kernels @xmath and @xmath is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.72)
  -- -------- -- --------

Indeed, using ( 6.63 ) we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.73)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore for example:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.74)
  -- -------- -- --------

Let us see how we can use the shorthand notations to derive a functional
equation on the resolvent of Bethe roots from ( 6.47 ) in the large
@xmath limit. By taking the logarithm of ( 6.47 ) we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.75)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the derivative of @xmath can be read from ( 6.5 ).

Now we use the fact that in the large @xmath limit the approximation
@xmath is valid. Here

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.76)
  -- -------- -- --------

is the density of particles and @xmath is the density of holes (in the
@xmath case holes are zeroes of the transfer matrix, see Sec. 7.2 ). We
can introduce the resolvent for the density of holes by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.77)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then, in the large @xmath limit the derivative of ( 6.75 ) is written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (6.78)
  -- -------- -- --------

This equation can be written in the form @xmath , where the function
@xmath is analytic in the upper half plane and the function @xmath is
analytic in the lower half plane ⁹ ⁹ 9 Here we basically give a
variation of the procedure of holomorphic projection explained in Sec.
3.1 . . Therefore @xmath . We therefore obtain an equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.79)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is valid in the upper half plane. Equation in the lower half plane
can be obtained from ( 6.79 ) by replacement @xmath .

Equation ( 6.79 ) is almost a BES/FRS equation [ 21 , 24 ] which we
discuss in chapter 8 . To obtain the BES/FRS equation we still have to
perform a proper scaling of the resolvents as discussed in section 7.3 .

If the resolvent admit some parity properties, ( 6.79 ) can be slightly
simplified. Let us decompose the resolvent into the symmetric and
antisymmetric parts: @xmath . The parity of the resolvent is opposite to
the parity of the density.

We use

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The kernels @xmath first appeared in [ KSV2 ] where they were derived
using analytical transformations of the inverse Fourier transform of
@xmath and @xmath of [ 21 ] .

Using ( 6.5 ) we can rewrite ( 6.79 ) as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.81)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the case of an even density distribution ( @xmath ) we get the
BES/FRS equation, up to a proper rescaling of the resolvents, in the
form used in [ V1 ] .

## Part III Functional form of integral Bethe Ansatz equations

In order to compare the prediction of the Bethe Ansatz equations for the
spectrum of the system with the field theoretical prediction one should
often consider the thermodynamical limit in which the Bethe Ansatz
equations reduce to the integral equation on the density of roots.
Therefore it is important to be able to solve these integral equations.

In the simplest case the equations can be solved using the Fourier
transform. For example such is the equation which describes the density
of roots of the state that corresponds to the antiferromagnetic vacuum
of the XXX spin chain:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.82)
  -- -------- -- --------

The solution of this equation is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.83)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the first part of this thesis we discussed a slightly different
approach which allows solving such equations. If we introduce the
resolvent

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.84)
  -- -------- -- --------

and integrate ( 6.82 ) with a Cauchy kernel @xmath , then we will get
the functional equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.85)
  -- -------- -- --------

and a complex conjugated equation for @xmath . This functional equation
can be solved for @xmath by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.86)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then the density function will be given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.87)
  -- -------- -- --------

Comparing position of poles and the residues for ( 6.83 ) and ( 6.87 )
we conclude that ( 6.83 ) and ( 6.87 ) are equal.

A more complicated case is when the density of Bethe roots is defined on
a compact support. For example, for the SU(2) XXX spin chain in the case
when the number of Bethe roots @xmath is smaller than @xmath the
equation ( 6.82 ) is replaced by ( 6.88 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.88)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the branch point @xmath is defined by @xmath . The function @xmath
(”density of holes”) is zero on the interval @xmath and is defined
outside it in such a way that the equation ( 6.88 ) is valid on the
whole real axis.

We cannot use directly the Fourier transform for solution of the
equation ( 6.88 ). For finite values of @xmath such equations in general
do not have explicit solution. However they can be solved perturbatively
for small and large values of @xmath .

We will consider a more interesting case of large values of @xmath . In
this case it is important to consider two different regimes.

First, we can rescale our rapidity variable as @xmath and consider the
limit @xmath with @xmath fixed. For this scaling we can perturbatively
expand the shift operator as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.89)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using this expansion, we can reduce functional equations on the
resolvents to a recursive tower of solvable Riemann-Hilbert problems.

Second, we can consider the vicinity of the branch point @xmath . For
this we should consider the double scaling limit

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.90)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this limit the equation ( 6.88 ) reduces to the integral equation on
the semiinfinite axis. It can be solved by a Wiener-Hopf method [ 218 ]
. This approach was used in many applications. We can mention [ 39 , 38
, 219 ] which are related to the integrability. We will discuss the
solution in the double scaling limit ( 6.90 ) in details in Sec. 7.4 .

The large @xmath and the double scaling limit of ( 6.88 ) lead to the
equations which allow in general many solutions. Only in the leading
order the solution can be fixed uniquely by imposing correct analytical
properties. We will show that in order to fix the solution in the
subleading orders of @xmath expansion we have to consider solutions in
both limits and demand their matching in the intermediate regime.

The search for the subleading orders of solutions of such equations has
a number of different motivations.

In chapter 7 we discuss the integral equation which appears in a special
limit of the @xmath Heisenberg ferromagnet. As we will explain, the
first three orders of the large @xmath expansion has a certain interest
for the AdS/CFT correspondence. The large @xmath expansion of this
system was investigated numerically in [ 220 , V1 ] . Here we give an
analytical derivation of this expansion. We also use this derivation to
explain all the details of our method.

In chapter 8 we discuss the so called BES/FRS equation [ 22 , 21 ] , [
24 ] which appears in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The
first three orders of the strong coupling expansion of this equation in
various regimes are required for the comparison with the perturbative
results of string theory [ 186 , 187 ] . This chapter is based on the
works [ KSV1 , KSV2 , V1 ] .

In chapter 9 we discuss how to find the mass gap in sigma models. For
instance, to fix the mass gap in the @xmath sigma model [ 39 ] we need
to find the first two (leading and subleading) orders of the large
@xmath expansion. The higher orders allow studying the Borel summability
properties of the model and in this way provide a check for the
correctness of the Bethe Ansatz description of the model. This chapter
is based on the author’s work [ V2 ] .

### Chapter 7 @xmath Heisenberg magnet

#### 7.1 Quantum mechanics reminder

The quantum mechanics of one particle is described by the Schr @xmath
dinger equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

To consider this equation in the quasiclassical limit it is convenient
to introduce a new variable @xmath in which the Schr @xmath dinger
equation reduces to the Ricatti equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the quasiclassical approximation which is valid for @xmath the
solution is simplified to @xmath . Then the wave function is given by
the superposition of two functions

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

For @xmath one of the exponents (say the second one) is exponentially
suppressed. To glue solutions in two different limits one should perform
in detail analysis in the vicinity of the turning points @xmath given by
@xmath . This analysis leads to the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization
condition on the energy levels of the particle

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a constant known as Maslow index. Its value depends on
the analytical properties of the potential @xmath near the turning
points. In particular, if it is smooth then @xmath , if it is a steep
function then @xmath .

The Baxter equation ( 7.6 ) can be viewed as a discrete version of the
Schr @xmath dinger equation. We will see below that analogs of both
smooth and steep potential @xmath appear in the quasiclassical solution
of the Baxter equation.

#### 7.2 Different regimes in the @xmath Heisenberg magnet

The @xmath Heisenberg magnet (with spin zero) appeared in particular in
the context of the integrable structures discovered in QCD [ 143 , 144 ,
145 , 221 ] . It was intensively studied in [ 222 , 223 ] . In the
context of the AdS/CFT correspondence the spin 1/2 @xmath Heisenberg
magnet has a particular interest. It describes the one-loop
approximation of the @xmath subsector of the AdS/CFT integrable system.

The Bethe equations for a spin @xmath @xmath magnet are written as
follows:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

All the solutions of these equations are real. The Baxter equation is
written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

The Baxter equation has a natural parameter which is a magnitude of the
discrete shift. In the normalization chosen here this scale equals one.
We will call it the Baxter scale.

Each solution has its own internal scales given by the typical distances
between the Bethe roots. It is well known that solutions organize
themselves into the cuts. We can distinguish two important scales: the
distance between the roots inside the cut ( @xmath ) and the distance
between the cuts themselves ( @xmath ).

In the thermodynamical limit one typically has a small parameter which
plays the role of @xmath . The solution is supposed to be expanded in
perturbative series within this parameter. It is natural to assume that
for a sufficiently small @xmath and inside one cut the typical
displacement of the Bethe roots within the change of @xmath does not
exceed the distance between the Bethe roots. Under this assumption, the
uniform expansion of the resolvent

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

in the parameter @xmath is possible at the distances from the cut larger
than @xmath .

The smallness of @xmath usually means that the parameter @xmath is
large. If it so, for @xmath we have exponential suppression of the
second term in the l.h.s. of ( 7.6 ). To estimate the magnitude of the
suppression one can approximate

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

We see that the real part of the r.h.s. is positive. Its magnitude
depends on the particular limit that we consider, but at any case for
large @xmath and @xmath the exponential suppression of the second term
in the l.h.s. of ( 7.6 ) is granted. Usually the restriction on @xmath
is weaker.

Under the assumption of the exponential suppression, the Baxter
equations are approximated by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

The equations ( 7.2 ) are equivalent to the linearized equation for the
counting function, see the discussion in section 3.1 .

The relation between the Baxter scale and @xmath can be different
depending on the limit we take.

In the case @xmath , which was studied in [ 224 ] , the typical distance
between roots is much larger than the Baxter scale. Then the
approximation ( 7.2 ) is valid only at the large distances from the real
axis. The perturbative @xmath expansion includes performing the Taylor
series of the type @xmath . If we perform this expansion in ( 7.2 ) then
in the leading order we get the equations that can be also obtained by
the differentiation of ( 5.47 ). This is not surprising since the limit
@xmath is the one studied in Sec. 5.4.2 .

In order to find the corrections to ( 7.2 ) we need to study the
vicinity of the branch point in the scaling limit which leads to the
solution in terms of the Airy function [ 224 ] . This type of limit is
similar to the case of the quantum mechanical particle in a smooth
potential.

In this chapter we consider another case which is analogical to the
particle in a steep potential. In this case the distance between the
Bethe roots is much smaller than the Baxter scale, the equations ( 7.2 )
are valid for any value of @xmath .

This case corresponds to the limit

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

initially discussed in [ 199 ] . We use the notation of [ 24 ] .

The scaling ( 7.10 ) is possible because in the case of a noncompact
spin chain the number of excitations @xmath can be greater than the
length of the spin chain @xmath .

###### The root distribution near the branch cut

Let us take the logarithm of the Bethe equations ( 7.5 ). We obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.11)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The equation ( ) can be interpreted as the equation for the equilibrium
of forces in classical mechanics. For distances between the particles
much larger than one, the interaction between the particles can be
approximated with the Coulomb force @xmath . In this case the density of
the particles is approximated by a square root cut in the leading order
of the large spin limit. This case is realized in the scaling limit
@xmath .

For the scaling ( 7.10 ) we have the opposite situation: the distances
between the particles with the smallest absolute values of rapidities
are much smaller than one. The Coulomb approximation is not applicable.
To describe the distribution of roots in this limit it is better to
represent @xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

If we introduce the effective force @xmath , then for the positive roots
equation of the equilibrium will be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath is a smooth function, we immediately get that in the
vicinity of the branch point

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

The last estimation comes from the term @xmath which is dominant in
@xmath for roots close to the origin. The expression ( 7.14 ) is
consistent with the assumption of the small distance between the roots.
It is valid for @xmath which is the case for any finite @xmath .
Equidistant distribution of the roots corresponds to a branch point of
logarithmic type in the continuous limit.

###### Functional equation in the logarithmic scaling regime (7.10).

Let us introduce the resolvent for holes ¹ ¹ 1 In opposite to the
compact case, there are no accompanying roots (in the terminology of
Sec. 1.3 ) in the r.h.s. of 7.6 . Due to this all zeroes of @xmath are
holes. For the same reason there is no string configurations. :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

Taking the derivative of the logarithm of ( 7.2 ) we get

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.16)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

We will consider the ground state in the limit ( 7.10 ). For the ground
state all the holes except two are situated inside the interval @xmath [
222 ] . The two external holes are situated at the position @xmath . All
the Bethe roots are situated between the interval @xmath and external
holes

Let us expand the equation ( 7.2 ) for @xmath at @xmath . We will get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

Demanding that the resolvent decreases at infinity, we get:

  -- -- -- --------
           (7.18)
  -- -- -- --------

We see that the external holes define the behavior of the resolvent for
the values of @xmath in the interval @xmath .

The energy can be calculated as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

It was shown in [ 199 ] that in the limit ( 7.4 ) the energy scales
logarithmically:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we introduced the normalization of @xmath which is used in the
AdS/CFT correspondence.

We see from ( 7.18 ) and ( 7.19 ) that the Bethe roots with absolute
value larger than @xmath do not contribute to @xmath . Therefore we can
consider that the asymptotic behavior of the resolvent at infinity is
given by ( 7.18 ).

#### 7.3 Large @xmath solution

In view of the asymptotic behavior ( 7.18 ) it is useful to rescale the
resolvents:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then in the scaling limit ( 7.10 ) we obtain the following functional
equations:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.22)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

with asymptotic behavior given by:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.23)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

These equations are equivalent to the linear integral equation on the
density of holes used in [ 24 , 25 ] .

The scaling function @xmath can be found as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath means that we analytically continue to the point @xmath
from a point @xmath which has a positive imaginary part.

We aim to solve ( 7.3 ) perturbatively for the case of large @xmath . As
we will see below, the position of the branch point, which we denote as
@xmath , scales as @xmath . Therefore the typical scale for the solution
is @xmath and the shift operator can be treated perturbatively:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

Let us consider the equations ( 7.3 ) on the support @xmath of the
density of holes. After multiplying the first one by @xmath and the
second one by @xmath and taking the sum we will get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

This equation can be rewritten in the following form:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.27)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Since @xmath , ( 7.27 ) gives us the possibility to perform the
perturbative expansion in the recursive manner. Of course, the solution
of ( 7.27 ) is not unique. We can always add to it a solution of the
homogeneous equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

The correct solution can be fixed from additional requirements, which we
give below.

###### Leading and subleading orders.

Let us assume the following large @xmath expansion of the resolvent:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

After performing the change of variables @xmath , the term @xmath should
scale as @xmath times a polynomial of @xmath .

A direct calculation gives the first two orders of the perturbative
expansion:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

The solution @xmath is obvious. For @xmath one can do a simple check:

  -- -------- -------- -- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath               (7.31)
                          @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -- -------- --------

The last expression is nonzero only for @xmath , therefore we can
replace @xmath by @xmath .

@xmath has the asymptotics at infinity required in ( 7.3 ). Therefore
all the other terms in the expansion ( 7.29 ) should decrease at least
as @xmath at infinity.

The solution of the homogeneous equation ( 7.28 ) can have singularities
only at @xmath . The general solution of the homogeneous equation which
decreases as @xmath at infinity is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

The index @xmath cannot be equal @xmath , since the first order in which
@xmath can appear is @xmath . The reason is that the expansion ( 7.29 )
is an expansion of an integrable function, which implies that @xmath
should be integrable.

To relate the boundary parameter @xmath with @xmath we have to use ( 7.3
), which for @xmath leads to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

The inverse differential operator means integration. The constant of
integration should be fixed from the parity properties of @xmath . The
result for the leading order of R is:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

Indeed, this function is odd if we take the cuts of the square root to
be @xmath which is the support of the density of roots.

To have the correct asymptotics at infinity we have to demand @xmath .
This relation should be corrected at the next orders of the large @xmath
expansion.

#### 7.4 Solution in the double scaling limit

Starting from @xmath we get a nontrivial contribution from ( 7.32 ) and
the solution of ( 7.27 ) becomes ambiguous. To fix this ambiguity, and
this is the key point for the perturbative solution of such kind of
equations, we should consider the initial equations in the double
scaling limit which is defined as follows. We introduce a new variable
@xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

and expand our equation in the powers of @xmath with @xmath fixed. We
get the equations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath has a discontinuity at @xmath , while @xmath has a
discontinuity at @xmath . The weak equivalence to zero means that the
@xmath is proportional to a function @xmath which is analytic at zero.

This equation can be solved explicitly after performing the inverse
Laplace transform

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We should consider the equations ( 7.4 ) order by order in the @xmath
expansion. At each order the function @xmath analytic at zero is just a
polynomial. Its inverse Laplace transform is therefore a sum of delta
function at @xmath and its derivatives. This sum does not affect the
conclusions that we will make in this section. We therefore put @xmath .

Let us investigate analytic properties of the function @xmath .

The resolvent @xmath has only one branch cut on @xmath in @xmath -plane.
Therefore the Laplace transform should be defined for @xmath . We
analytically continue the function @xmath to the region with @xmath by
changing the phase of @xmath and simultaneously rotating the contour of
integration of the Laplace transform such that @xmath . So, if we will
change @xmath in the clockwise direction, the contour of integration
should be rotated in the counterclockwise direction.

To get into the region @xmath the contour of integration passes through
the cut of @xmath . To get the analytical continuation of @xmath to the
other Riemann sheet we use the first equation in ( 7.4 ) to reexpress
@xmath in terms of @xmath . We see for example that when we pass through
the cut @xmath we encounter a branch point at @xmath .

Performing the Laplace transform of the first equation in ( 7.4 ) we see
that the analytical continuation of @xmath by rotation @xmath is given
by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath is analytic for @xmath we deduce that @xmath should have
zeroes for @xmath .

Equivalently we can find that for @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

The conclusion is that @xmath is a function analytic everywhere except
on the axis @xmath where it satisfies the equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

We can fix the solution of this equation if we remark that @xmath should
be expanded in inverse powers of @xmath at infinity. Indeed, from the
structure of the functional equations ( 7.4 ) we conclude that @xmath
should be analytic at @xmath . Therefore the total density @xmath should
be analytic as well. This implies that the expansion of @xmath at @xmath
is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

The inverse Laplace transform of this expansion is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is the stated behavior of @xmath at infinity.

The solution of ( 7.39 ) with the required structure of the zeroes and
behavior at infinity is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

At each order of @xmath expansion the sum @xmath contains only a finite
number of terms and therefore is well defined. For convenience we put
the overall normalization @xmath such that @xmath .

The dependence of @xmath on @xmath of course cannot be understood from
the equation ( 7.39 ). It will become clear when we will show how to
find the coefficients @xmath .

#### 7.5 Higher orders in perturbative expansion

The still unknown coefficients @xmath in ( 7.32 ) and @xmath in ( 7.42 )
are fixed by demanding that the large @xmath expansion ( 7.29 ) and the
expansion ( 7.42 ) in the double scaling limit match in the intermediate
regime. The expansion ( 7.29 ) in the double scaling regime ( 9.27 )
organizes at each order of @xmath as a large @xmath expansion, therefore
it should match with the Laplace transform of the small @xmath expansion
of ( 7.42 ).

Let us see how this works for @xmath . The general solution of ( 7.27 )
at this order is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

Reexpansion of @xmath in the double scaling regime is then given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

Correspondingly, the Laplace transform of the small @xmath expansion of
( 7.42 ) is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

The first two terms in ( 7.44 ) are analytic at @xmath . Demanding the
weak equivalence between ( 7.44 ) and ( 7.45 ) in the sense of ( 7.4 )
we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

To obtain the expansion ( 7.48 ) we need also @xmath . The solution at
this order is given in appendix D .

To relate the parameters @xmath and @xmath we find the resolvent @xmath
from ( 7.33 ) and demand that it has the correct asymptotic behavior (
7.3 ). This leads to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

The scaling function @xmath can be found from ( 7.24 ). In terms of
@xmath this is a rather complicated expression containing @xmath as
well. But in terms of the parameter @xmath it significantly simplifies:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

This expansion matches with numerical analysis in [ 220 , V1 ] .

These three orders of large @xmath expansion lie in the BMN-like window
of the AdS/CFT. More precisely, as we conclude from [ 209 ] the large
@xmath expansion of the generalized scaling function @xmath has the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this expansion the coefficients @xmath do not depend on the coupling
constant. The coefficients @xmath define the expansion ( 7.48 ). The
coefficients @xmath appear in the large @xmath expansion of the two-loop
correction to the generalized scaling function and were not calculated
here.

@xmath and @xmath can be found respectively from tree [ 173 , 174 ] and
one loop [ 209 ] calculations on the string side. In [ V1 ] @xmath was
found from the strong coupling solution of the BES/FRS equation up to
two loops. All findings are in agreement with ( 7.48 ).

### Chapter 8 Generalized scaling function at strong coupling

#### 8.1 BES/FRS equation and different regimes at strong coupling

In the previous chapter we discussed the energy of the ground state of
the @xmath Heisenberg ferromagnet in various regimes of the
thermodynamic limit. We saw that the answer depends strongly on the
relation of two parameters - the twist @xmath and the number of magnons
@xmath . For @xmath the energy scales logarithmically with a prefactor
@xmath , @xmath . One expects [ 24 ] that the logarithmic scaling of the
anomalous dimension

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

in the limit with fixed @xmath takes place at any finite value of the
coupling constant @xmath . In section 5.4.3 we discussed how @xmath can
be used for the test of integrability in AdS/CFT. Now more technical
details would be given.

The Heisenberg ferromagnet describes the spectrum of the dilatation
operator only at one loop. The all-loop result may be obtained from the
conjectured Beisert-Staudacher asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. In the @xmath
sector it reduces to the one integral equation known as the BES/FRS
equation. Its derivation is completely analogous to the derivation of
the one loop equation discussed above. This equation was initially
derived in [ 24 ] and also in [ 25 ] . In our notations it reads [ V1 ]
:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.2)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

The kernels @xmath are defined by [ KSV2 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is given by ( 6.71 ).

The asymptotic behavior of the resolvents at infinity is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.5)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Based on the all-loop integral equation ( 8.1 ), we can relate the
generalized scaling function @xmath and the parameter @xmath in ( 8.1 )
¹ ¹ 1 This property was initially remarked in [ 26 ] . . Indeed, the
anomalous dimension is given by the formula

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.6)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Expanding the BES/FRS equation ( 8.1 ) at infinity, we obtain for the
coefficients in front of @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

Comparing ( 8.6 ) and ( 8.7 ), we conclude that the generalized scaling
function can be found as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

Note that the derivation of this relation includes expansion of the
kernel @xmath at large @xmath , therefore it is essentially based on the
higher order corrections to the one-loop integral equation.

The resolvents @xmath and @xmath in the BES/FRS equation have two types
of branch points. The first type of branch points has ”kinematic” origin
- these are branch points of the inverse Zhukovsky map @xmath which is
singular at @xmath . The ”kinematic” branch points are located at @xmath
. The branch points of the second type are located at @xmath , where
@xmath is the end of the root distribution.

It is natural to assume that the only nonanalyticities in the
generalized scaling function appear at the values of @xmath and @xmath
for which the branch points of different types collide. For real finite
@xmath and @xmath the collision is impossible. However, if we take into
account complex values of these parameters, the collision is possible.
Using this observation, we can determine in particular the radius of
convergence of the weak coupling expansion of @xmath . Indeed, for
@xmath we have @xmath . The kinematic branch point touches the origin
when @xmath . Therefore, the radius of convergence equals @xmath . This
observation coincides with the numerical prediction in [ 21 ] .

To investigate analytical properties of the generalized scaling function
at strong coupling it is useful to introduce the rescaled coordinate
@xmath . At strong coupling all the kinematic points condense into two
points @xmath that are situated on the real axis. Therefore we will
potentially have different regimes depending where the branch point
@xmath is situated: inside the interval @xmath , outside it, or at the
finite distance from the point @xmath .

###### Finite-twist operators and small perturbations.

This is a regime in which @xmath is situated inside the interval @xmath
. In the particular case when @xmath (and therefore @xmath ) the
generalized scaling function reduces to twice the cusp anomalous
dimension

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

To obtain a nonzero @xmath inside the interval @xmath the parameter
@xmath should scale as @xmath , so it is exponentially small. As was
shown in the works of Alday and Maldacena [ 49 ] and Basso and
Korchemsky [ 34 ] , this regime is effectively described by the dynamics
of the @xmath sigma model. The quantity @xmath can be viewed as the
vacuum energy and @xmath is identified with the energy of the @xmath
sigma model. The physical motivation for this particular description was
discussed in Sec. 5.4.3 . In Sec. 8.3 we give a derivation, alternative
to the one in [ 34 ] , of the integral equation for the @xmath sigma
model from the BES/FRS integral equation.

###### The limit with @xmath.

In the large @xmath limit with @xmath fixed the branch point is situated
outside the interval @xmath . The position of branch point at @xmath is
given by [ 30 , 48 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

@xmath for any positive @xmath . Therefore if we perform the
perturbation series as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

each function @xmath should be analytical function of @xmath . This
regime was a subject of investigation of [ V1 ] . In Sec. 8.4 we discuss
the results of this investigation.

###### Intermediate regime.

Finally, let us consider the regime when the distance between the branch
point @xmath and the Zhukovsky branch point @xmath is of order of @xmath
. This limit should describe the transition between the @xmath sigma
model which is realized in the case @xmath and the string perturbative
regime @xmath . From the @xmath sigma model we know that @xmath behaves
as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

Performing the small @xmath expansion of the expression of ( 8.10 ) we
get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore if we introduce the parameter @xmath and consider the strong
coupling limit with @xmath fixed we can expect that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath interpolating smoothly between the asymptotics ( 8.12 ) and
( 8.14 ). This observation is further supported by the known analytic
structure of the BES/FRS equation: we do not encounter new singular
points while varying @xmath .

The study of this regime was not done and may be the subject of a future
research.

#### 8.2 Cusp anomalous dimension

The BES/FRS equation for @xmath (and therefore @xmath ) reduces to the
BES equation. This is the very equation in which the all-loop proposal
for the BES/BHL dressing phase initially appeared. The cusp anomalous
dimension which can be found from the solution of the BES equation is a
nontrivial quantity and is accessible up to four loops on the gauge side
and up to two loops on the string side. The perturbative recursive
solution of the BES equation at strong coupling was found, after a
number of initial attempts [ 26 ] , [ 29 , 27 ] , [ 28 , KSV1 ] , [ 30 ,
31 ] , in [ 32 ] , [ KSV2 ] . Here we will show that the method used for
the solution is in fact the same as the one used in the previous
chapter. Our analysis follows closely [ KSV2 ] with a few improvements.

The BES equation reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

with the asymptotic conditions on @xmath given by ( 8.1 ). It turns out
to be useful to introduce the resolvents ² ² 2 In [ KSV2 ] we used a
shifted definition:

@xmath

@xmath and @xmath in the upper half of the @xmath -plane by the
following equations valid for any value of the coupling constant:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.16)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.17)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.18)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

There are combinations @xmath and @xmath of @xmath and @xmath with
simple analytical properties. They are defined in the upper half plane
by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.19)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.20)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

and further by analytical continuation ³ ³ 3 Similar linear combinations
in the Fourier space were initially proposed in [ 32 ] . .

The functions @xmath and @xmath have square root type branching at the
points @xmath inherited from @xmath and @xmath . If to choose the branch
cut to be on @xmath for @xmath and on @xmath for @xmath then one can
show from the definitions of @xmath and @xmath and the property ( 8.32 )
of the kernels @xmath that @xmath and @xmath are analytic outside these
cuts. Analytical continuation through the cuts reveals the branch points
at @xmath on the next sheet.

The resolvents @xmath and @xmath are related in the upper half plane as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath and @xmath have discontinuities on the complementary cuts,
( 8.21 ) is very similar to the integral equations which follows from
the Baxter equations (for example like ( 7.2 )).

The resolvents @xmath perturbatively at strong coupling, in the regime
@xmath with @xmath fixed, satisfy the equations [ KSV2 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

We see that the BES equation reduces to a very simple Riemann-Hilbert
problem. Its most general solution is given by:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the formula ( 8.8 ) and the definitions of the resolvents, we
derive that the scaling function can be expressed in terms of @xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

Similarly to the discussion in chapter 7 , to fix the coefficients
@xmath we should solve ( 8.21 ) in the double scaling limit

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

and then demand the compatibility of this solution with ( 8.23 ). The
demand that the double scaling limit exists explains the presence of
@xmath factor in ( 8.23 ). The coefficients @xmath should be bounded at
@xmath .

The solution in the double scaling limit can be most easily found if to
apply the inverse Laplace transform:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

The study of the analytical properties of @xmath and @xmath , see the
discussion near Fig. 7.1 , leads to the conclusion that @xmath is
analytic everywhere except on the negative real axis and @xmath is
analytic everywhere except on the positive real axis.

The inverse Laplace transform of ( 8.21 ) has the following form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

This equation and the equation for @xmath , which can be similarly
derived, imply that @xmath and @xmath have monodromy of order four
around zero ⁴ ⁴ 4 We can see this also in the following way. The
monodromy of @xmath around zero is inherited from the monodromy of
@xmath around infinity. At large values of @xmath the solution in the
double scaling limit should match with the perturbative solution ( 8.23
). The monodromy of the latter is of order four, as it follows from (
8.22 ). .

Another consequence of ( 8.27 ) is the following. Let us analytically
continue this equation to @xmath by the path that does not cross the
real axis. Then, since @xmath is analytic for @xmath , @xmath should
have zeroes at @xmath and may have poles only at @xmath .

Finally, @xmath has a square root branch point at @xmath , same as the
square root branch point for @xmath at finite @xmath . This implies that
at @xmath @xmath is expanded in inverse half-integer powers of @xmath .

The most general solution for @xmath with stated above properties is
given by

  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      @xmath      (8.28)
     @xmath      @xmath      
  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------

The requirement of compatibility of the solutions ( 8.23 ) and ( 8.28 )
fixes unambiguously all the coefficients @xmath and @xmath . This
requirement in particular implies the presence of an overall factor
@xmath in ( 8.28 ) and that @xmath should be bounded at @xmath . The
algorithmic procedure for calculation of @xmath and @xmath , realized
with the help of Mathematica , is presented in appendix E.2 .

As a result, at first three orders of the strong coupling expansion we
get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

This result was initially obtained in [ 32 ] . The derivation there
contained number of assumptions which we were able to prove in [ KSV2 ]
confirming that result. The obtained expansion ( 8.29 ) coincides with
the two-loop string prediction [ 225 , 186 ] . This was the first
two-loop test at strong coupling of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz
proposal.

#### 8.3 @xmath sigma model

The appearance of the @xmath sigma model in a special regime of the
AdS/CFT system can be understood from the point of view of the string
theory. If we consider a folded string solution, then the centrifugal
forces make all the fluctuations on the AdS space, as well all the
fermion excitations massive. Therefore the low-energy excitations in the
theory should be described by the fluctuating modes that live on @xmath
, i.e. by the @xmath sigma model. The mass of the AdS fluctuating modes
determines the energy scale below which the @xmath sigma model
approximation is applicable.

We can test the @xmath sigma model regime if we consider the string
which moves around equator of the @xmath in addition to the rotation in
@xmath , and therefore is described by the @xmath angular momentum
@xmath and the @xmath angular momentum @xmath . This is the
configuration which is described by the @xmath equation.

In order to stay in the @xmath sigma model regime, we should put @xmath
. More precisely, @xmath should be at most of the order @xmath . We
again come back to a parameter @xmath . As we will see below, the
density ⁵ ⁵ 5 number per unit volume of holes of the BES/FRS equation is
proportional to @xmath .

The @xmath sigma model, through the mechanism of dimensional
transmutation, acquires a nontrivial mass scale @xmath which should
depend on the coupling constant by the law

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

A very nontrivial check of the integrability in the AdS/CFT
correspondence would be to identify the @xmath particles with holes of
the BES/FRS equation as far as we stay at the energies much lower than
the masses of fluctuations in AdS. This regime is possible when @xmath
is finite. In this case we come back to the scaling law ( 8.12 ) for the
strong coupling behavior of @xmath .

The identification of the BES/FRS holes and the excitations of the
@xmath sigma model was done by Basso and Korchemsky in [ 34 ] . They
showed that in the regime ( 8.12 ) the BES/FRS equation can be reduced
to the integral equation obeyed by the particles of the @xmath sigma
model. Here we will give a different derivation of their result.

Let us consider in addition to the BES/FRS equation ( 8.1 ) in the
u.h.p, the BES/FRS equation in the l.h.p. It reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

For the meaning of notation @xmath see appendix A .

In our derivation we will rely on the properties of the kernels @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

and on the fact that @xmath and @xmath are odd functions.

Considering the BES/FRS equation for @xmath we can make the following
transformations:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
                       @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.33)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Let us introduce an additional notation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using this notation we can rewrite

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

Summarizing, we can rewrite the BES/FRS equation in the upper and the
lower half planes as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.36)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Let us consider the interval @xmath . In this interval @xmath . We
therefore can derive

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

We see that remarkably @xmath is almost decoupled from @xmath . In the
l.h.s. of ( 8.37 ) we recognize the l.h.s. of perturbative functional
equation for the @xmath sigma model ( 9.24 ).

The exact equation for the @xmath sigma model is written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

Let us then take the l.h.s. of the last equation and evaluate it using (
8.3 ). After some algebra we will get

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.39)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The functions @xmath and @xmath have the same periodicity as @xmath and
branch points at the positions @xmath . Therefore at the leading order
we expect

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

We see that this gives the correct integral equation for the @xmath
sigma model.

The calculation of the coefficient @xmath is tricky and was done
explicitly in [ 34 ] . It is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore we see that the induced mass of the @xmath sigma model has a
correct RG behavior (prefactor @xmath ).

#### 8.4 Connection to the perturbative string theory calculations.

We have already discussed the limits which lead @xmath at strong
coupling. The limit which leads to @xmath at strong coupling is @xmath
with @xmath fixed. The interest for this limit, which was studied in [
V1 ] , is motivated by the fact that naively the expansion ( 8.11 ) can
be directly compared with the string theory results. However, the order
of limits in calculation of ( 8.11 ) is different from that used on the
string theory side. On the string theory side the logarithmic scaling
regime is attained in the following two-step limiting procedure:

  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      (8.42)
  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------

To compare, ( 8.11 ) is obtained using the following order of limits

  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      (8.43)
  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------

There is a qualitative difference between two limiting orders ( 8.4 )
and ( 8.4 ), which may become important starting from two loops. It is
shown at the r.h.s. of Fig. 8.1 .

The limiting procedure ( 8.4 ) is organized in a way that the distance
between the Bethe roots in the vicinity of the branch point is larger
than the Baxter scale. Therefore in the vicinity of the branch point we
need both terms in the Baxter equation and approximation in which the
BES/FRS equation was derived is inapplicable. This situation is similar
to the WKB solution of quantum mechanics in a smooth potential.

In the limiting procedure ( 8.4 ) the distance between the Bethe roots
in the vicinity of the branch point is much smaller than the Baxter
scale. This is similar to the WKB solution in quantum mechanics with a
steep function at the turning point.

This qualitative difference is absent in the case when we consider the
strong coupling regime with @xmath . As shown at the l.h.s. of Fig. 8.1
, the density of roots is always large in this case.

In [ V1 ] the discrepancy at two-loop level was found between ( 8.11 )
and the solution in [ 48 ] of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz in the order
of limits ( 8.4 ). We however were not able to show explicitly that this
discrepancy is due to the explained qualitative difference between two
cases.

We see therefore that there are reasons to doubt the possibility of
application of the BES/FRS equation, at least without modifications, for
the comparison of the Bethe Ansatz and perturbative string results. The
calculation in [ 48 ] was done using the order of limits ( 8.4 ) and
therefore should match the string theory prediction [ 187 ] . However,
there is a discrepancy at the two-loop level.

Another possibility to check the results of [ 48 , 187 ] was proposed in
[ 37 ] based on the @xmath sigma model regime. The two-loop prediction
of [ 37 ] matched that of [ 48 ] . This matching should be however
better understood, since the order of limits used in [ 37 ] was
different from ( 8.4 ) (and from ( 8.4 )).

### Chapter 9 Mass gap in integrable sigma models

#### 9.1 Formulation of the problem

Another important application of the techniques developed in previous
chapters is the perturbative solution of integral equations which appear
in two-dimensional integrable sigma models.

Two-dimensional nonlinear sigma models are often considered as toy
models for QCD. They share with QCD the property of the asymptotic
freedom [ 226 ] . Although these theories do not have dimensionful
parameters on the classical level, they acquire a dynamical mass scale
on the quantum level via the dimensional transmutation mechanism. We
will call this mass scale @xmath .

The symmetry group @xmath of the target space of the sigma model is the
analog of the QCD gauge group. The sigma models with the target space
being a coset manifold @xmath are classically integrable [ 168 ] . It is
believed that when @xmath is simple the integrability is preserved on
the quantum level. Examples of such quantum integrable theories are
@xmath vector sigma model and @xmath principal chiral field (PCF) model.
@xmath sigma model is an example of the theory which is integrable on
the classical but not on the quantum level.

As in QCD, the sigma models can be studied perturbatively at scales much
larger than the dynamical mass scale. In the infrared regime the
perturbative description is not applicable. Instead, it is possible to
solve these theories exactly. For example, large @xmath solutions of
such models as @xmath and @xmath sigma models were found in [ 71 , 72 ,
227 , 228 ] . These solutions showed that the excitations are described
on the quantum level by massive particles. Since @xmath is the only
dimensionful parameter of the theory, the mass of the particles should
be proportional to it:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

If to assume that the description in terms of particles is appropriate
for finite values of @xmath then quantum integrable sigma models can be
solved by the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz in the infinite volume [ 7 ] , as
we discussed in the second chapter.

In this chapter we will explain how to determine the coefficient of
proportionality @xmath in ( 9.1 ) for the @xmath sigma model at finite
@xmath . Although we will consider only this particular case, most of
the statements can be applied for any sigma model solvable by the
asymptotic Bethe Ansatz.

The idea of determination of the coefficient @xmath is not new. It goes
back to [ 38 , 39 ] . We refer also to [ 229 ] for an overview. The mass
gap ( 9.1 ) was found in [ 38 , 39 ] numerically with a precision that
allowed to guess the analytical expression. Our contribution is to give
an analytical derivation of the mass gap ¹ ¹ 1 In [ 230 ] it was stated
that Balog had provided such analytical derivation (see ref.[19] there).
His result was however not published. .

The determination of the mass gap is not the only issue of this chapter.
We will also discuss the renorm-group behavior and Borel summability
properties of the @xmath sigma model. This will bring us an additional
evidence that the Bethe Ansatz is a proper description of this QFT.

###### Sigma-model in an external field

Let us consider an asymptotically free model with a running coupling
constant @xmath that satisfies the Gell-Man--Low equation ² ² 2 We may
choose @xmath equal to @xmath from ( 2.1 ). This is however not at all
obligatory. In fact, below we will make another choice which is related
to @xmath via the finite renormalization ( 9.41 ). :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

The dynamically generated scale @xmath is the RG invariant which can be
built from ( 9.2 ):

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

The quantity @xmath is invariant under finite renormalizations of the
coupling constant given by the transformations of the type

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

This scheme independent object @xmath is an important prediction of the
perturbation theory.

From ( 9.3 ) we can see that the mass gap ( 9.1 ) cannot be found by
perturbative means only. Therefore integrability, or another
nonperturbative description, is needed. A typical way for identification
of the coefficient @xmath is the comparison of the perturbative field
theory prediction with the prediction of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz.
Since the theory is asymptotically free, we have to introduce a large
scale in order to insure that we are in the perturbative regime. A
strong external field @xmath coupled to one of the charges @xmath of the
system is often used for this purpose. @xmath sigma model in the
presence of the external field was initially considered in the works of
Polyakov and Wiegmann [ 68 , 231 ] . The thermodynamics of the system,
which we consider at zero temperature, can be described by the free
energy which is a minimum with respect to the value of the charge @xmath
of

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here @xmath is the energy of the system.

@xmath sigma model contains only one type of particles that belong to
the vector multiplet of the @xmath group. We chose a charge @xmath which
counts the number of particles polarized in a particular direction. Then
@xmath plays the role of the chemical potential. For @xmath larger than
the mass gap a condensate of equally polarized particles is created.

In the limit of infinite volume @xmath we should speak about intensive
quantities: the density of the particles @xmath , the free energy
density @xmath , and the energy density @xmath . These intensive
quantities are related as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

The free energy density @xmath is a function of @xmath . Instead, @xmath
, which is the Legendre transform of @xmath , is a function of @xmath .

Perturbative field theory predicts the following asymptotic weak
coupling expansion of the energy density:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the running coupling constant @xmath is evaluated at the scale
@xmath . The ratio @xmath is exponentially small in terms of the
coupling constant.

The dependence of @xmath on @xmath can be figured out from the condition
@xmath and decomposition ( 9.7 ). It is given by the expansion

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

It is useful to think about the coupling constant as the function of
@xmath and to introduce the corresponding beta-function

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

From ( 9.8 ) it follows that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

The explicit value of the coefficients @xmath depends on the computation
scheme which is used and on the definition of the coupling constant. The
energy of the @xmath sigma model at tree level and its one-loop
correction were calculated in [ 38 , 39 ] ³ ³ 3 More precisely, the free
energy was found. Then we can make the Legendre transform to obtain the
expression for the energy. . The two-loop correction was found in [ 37 ]
⁴ ⁴ 4 This work contains a very good pedagogical explanation about how
the perturbative calculations are done. . The calculations were done in
the @xmath scheme. With the coupling constant defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

the first three coefficients @xmath were found to be

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

The definition ( 9.11 ) of the coupling constant is the same as in [ 37
] , where it was called @xmath . The reason to use such definition is
that it leads to a particularly simple form of the coefficients @xmath ,
as we discuss below.

We can rewrite the expansion ( 9.7 ) in terms of the ratio @xmath only:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.13)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

The idea of [ 38 , 39 ] to calculate the mass gap ( 9.1 ) is based on
the fact that the energy of the considered system can be also found from
the Bethe Ansatz. Instead of @xmath , the solution should depend on the
ratio of the density and the mass of the particles, since the mass of
the particles serves as an input for the construction of the Bethe
Ansatz. One should expect the expression of the following form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.14)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Comparison of ( 9.13 ) and ( 9.14 ) gives us a possibility to find
@xmath in ( 9.1 ). The expansions ( 9.13 ) and ( 9.14 ) contain also
another valuable information. They contain the invariant ratio @xmath .
Therefore we can verify that the Bethe Ansatz reproduces a correct
renorm-group dynamics of the model. It is a nontrivial check of the
bootstrap approach. A priory , the Bethe Ansatz does not contain
coupling constant at all. But it turns out to be useful to introduce a
coupling constant in order to rewrite ( 9.14 ) in terms of the power
series of the coupling constant (like ( 9.7 )).

###### Integral equation

Since only the states with a certain polarization are excited, the
nested levels of the Bethe Ansatz are turned off. Therefore in the large
volume limit the system with a given density of particles @xmath is
described by the one integral equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (9.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here @xmath is a density of the Bethe roots distribution. The boundary
@xmath of the Bethe roots distribution is the value of rapidity up to
which the Fermi sea is filled. This value should be found from the
normalization condition

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

The energy density of the system is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

The energy density @xmath depends on the particle density @xmath through
the parameter @xmath . Our goal is to find this parametric dependence
for large @xmath , or equivalently large @xmath .

One can see (from numerical solution for example) that the density of
roots grows when it approaches the points @xmath . Therefore we can use
the methods explained in the previous chapters to perturbatively solve
the integral equation. The discussed below solution is the extended
version of the work [ V2 ] .

The @xmath -matrix is given by ratio of the gamma functions. Using the
formal equivalence ⁵ ⁵ 5 In ( 2.16 ) we already used such notation.
Moreover, there we defined the r.h.s. of ( 9.18 ) as the gamma function.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

and introducing the resolvent

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

we can rewrite the integral equation ( 9.1 ) in an elegant form:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here the shift operator is defined by @xmath and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 9.2 Perturbative expansion

Let us act on ( 9.20 ) with the operator @xmath , which is well defined
operation. The r.h.s. of ( 9.20 ) will vanish and we are left with

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

The action of the shift operator in this notation is understood as an
analytical continuation.

If to consider this equation perturbatively in the regime

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

the overall operator @xmath can be dropped in the perturbative expansion
by the following reason. This operator is perturbatively understood as a
power series in @xmath . Integrating the obtained equation in each order
of the perturbation theory we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

up to a constant of integration. However, this constant is zero since
@xmath is an odd function.

The equation ( 9.24 ) can be solved perturbatively. Its most general
solution is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . The perturbative meaning of the expansion ( 9.25 ) is
most easily seen in terms of the variable @xmath .

The coefficients @xmath are not all independent. The coefficients for
the terms which contain logarithms can be defined uniquely through the
other coefficients using equation ( 9.24 ). However, below we will show
a more efficient way to fix them.

The solution ( 9.25 ) gives us the value for the particle density from
the residue of the resolvent at infinity:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 9.3 Solution in the double scaling limit

To fix all the coefficients @xmath , we follow exactly the same
procedure as we did in the previous chapters. Namely, we consider a
double scaling limit

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

and perform the inverse Laplace transform defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

The double scaling limit of ( 9.20 ) and further its inverse Laplace
transform give the following equation:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (9.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here we neglected the exponentially small terms since our goal is to
find the asymptotic large @xmath expansion. Neglecting these terms
allows reexpressing the energy in terms of @xmath . Indeed,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

The study of the analytical structure of the resolvent goes similarly to
study in chapter 7 (note that the role of @xmath and @xmath are
exchanged in these two cases). The conclusion is that:

-   @xmath is analytic everywhere except on the negative real axis,

-   For @xmath @xmath has a branch cut. The monodromy around the branch
    point @xmath is given by the equation:

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (9.31)
      -- -------- -- --------

-   @xmath has an infinite set of poles and zeroes on the negative real
    axes. The position of poles and zeroes is such that all the poles
    and zeroes of @xmath for @xmath are canceled out, except for the
    pole at @xmath , which is a singularity of the r.h.s. of ( 9.3 ).

-   The asymptotic behavior of @xmath at large @xmath is given by

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (9.32)
      -- -------- -- --------

The solution of ( 9.3 ) which satisfies these properties is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.33)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The dependence of @xmath on @xmath is not a consequence of ( 9.3 ). It
comes from the comparison of ( 9.3 ) and ( 9.25 ). @xmath contains only
finite number of terms at each order of @xmath expansion. Therefore the
solution ( 9.3 ) is well defined.

To fix all the coefficients @xmath and @xmath , we should consider (
9.25 ) in the double scaling limit. In this limit the expansion
organizes at each order of @xmath as a @xmath expansion. This expansion
should match with the Laplace transform of the small @xmath expansion of
@xmath . This requirement uniquely fixes all the coefficients. We used
Mathematica to obtain first 25 orders of the perturbative expansion. The
routine for this calculation is given in appendix E.3 .

#### 9.4 Results for the mass gap coefficient and the RG dynamics.

At the leading and subleading orders the energy and particle densities
are given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

By explicit solution of this parametric dependence and comparison with (
9.13 ) we get the correct value of the mass gap known in the literature
and given by [ 38 , 39 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here the @xmath -parameter is defined in the @xmath scheme.

We would like to note that the importance of the solution is not only in
finding the coefficient of proportionality. The expression for the
energy density in terms of the parameter @xmath contains both @xmath and
@xmath terms. The fact that we can cancel all the double logarithm terms
by introducing a proper coupling constant is very nontrivial. Moreover,
this cancelation is only possible if the coupling constant has a
beta-function with the correct ratio @xmath predicted by the quantum
field theory. This shows that the Bethe Ansatz correctly reproduces the
renorm-group dynamics of the model.

The presence of the CDD factors ⁶ ⁶ 6 The crossing and unitarity
equations constrain the scalar factor in the scattering matrix up to a
multiplier known as the CDD factor. This factor can be fixed if the
complete particle content of the theory is known. would change this
renorm-group dynamics. Therefore this calculation also serves as a
verification of the assumption about the particle content of the theory.

#### 9.5 Borel summability

The recursive procedure allows us to find analytical expression for the
first @xmath orders of the perturbation theory. We are able therefore to
analyze the large order behavior of the coefficients of the asymptotic
expansion. Comparison of the large order behavior that we get from the
Bethe Ansatz with the prediction of the quantum field theory gives us an
additional check of the validity of the Bethe Ansatz description of the
@xmath sigma model.

Let us briefly recall the basic facts about asymptotic series.
Typically, a small coupling expansion in a quantum field theory is an
asymptotic expansion with zero radius of convergence. Probably the only
known example of the convergent series is when models are considered in
the ’t Hooft planar limit.

In opposite to the case with convergent series, there is no bijection
between the function and the asymptotic series. Although the asymptotic
expansion of the function is uniquely defined, the inverse is not true.
It is often postulated that the function which corresponds to a given
asymptotic expansion is given by the Borel ressumation of the asymptotic
series.

Suppose that this series is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Borel sum of this series is defined by the integral

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

The integrand is given by the series which is convergent provided that
@xmath grow at most factorially. In the most interesting cases @xmath
grow exactly in factorial way. Therefore the series has a finite radius
of convergence. The integrand in ( 9.37 ) is defined using the
analytical continuation of the function

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is well defined by its series expansion for a sufficiently small
@xmath .

Let us suppose that @xmath has a singularity (we will consider only
poles for simplicity) at @xmath with @xmath . Then we can choose
different contours of integration, as it shown in Fig. 9.1 .

Different choices of the contours obviously lead to different functions
@xmath . However, these functions have the same asymptotic expansion. We
see that the Borel transform is an ambiguous procedure in this case. A
series ( 9.36 ) with such properties is called non-Borel-summable.

When all the singularities of @xmath are situated to the left from the
imaginary axes, we can uniquely choose the contour of integration. In
this case the Borel summation is the unambiguous procedure. An
asymptotic series for which Borel transform is uniquely defined is
called Borel-summable.

The large order behavior of the asymptotic expansion gives a valuable
information about the existence/absence of singularities in the Borel
plane. If the large order behavior of the coefficients @xmath is
approximated by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

then @xmath has a singularity at @xmath . If the sign of @xmath is
positive, we get a non-Borel-summable theory. Therefore sign oscillation
of the asymptotic expansion is a necessary condition for the Borel
summability. Of course, this condition is not at all sufficient.

Let us now investigate what is the asymptotic behavior of the
coefficients in the @xmath sigma model. The large @xmath behavior for
the coefficients @xmath is approximated by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

The qualitative behavior of the coefficients @xmath is different for
large and small values of @xmath . For @xmath , and therefore @xmath ,
we have @xmath , so we have a sign oscillating series. We will see below
that this is in agreement with the observation that exactly at @xmath
the asymptotic expansion is Borel-summable.

For sufficiently small @xmath the coefficients of the series become
positive. So, @xmath for @xmath and @xmath for @xmath . We see that at
least for sufficiently small @xmath the series is non-Borel-summable.
The Borel ambiguity is of order @xmath as it should be from the field
theory point of view (see ( 9.13 )).

For other values of @xmath the behavior of the coefficients is more
complicated. It seems that they reflect the concurrence between two
singularities at @xmath in the Borel plane.

For @xmath the asymptotic behavior of @xmath is estimated by @xmath ,
where @xmath is positive. This shows that we have an additional
singularity in the Borel plane at @xmath . This singularity determines
the asymptotic behavior of the coefficients for @xmath .

Let us compare our results with the predictions of the quantum field
theory. In quantum field theory there are two sources of the
singularities in the Borel plane: instantons and renormalons. Both of
them are present in the @xmath sigma model.

###### Instantons.

Instanton is defined as a solution of the equations of motion in the
imaginary time with finite value of the Euclidian action. As was
observed by Lipatov [ 232 ] , there are singularities in the Borel plane
related to instanton solutions. We will apply the method of [ 232 ] to
find the position of these singularities.

The relation between the coupling constant @xmath that we use and @xmath
that was used in ( 2.1 ) is the following:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

For our discussion it would be sufficient only the leading order. Let us
consider a physical quantity

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

The @xmath -th order of the asymptotic expansion of @xmath can be found
from the correspondent residue under the functional integral

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the saddle point approximation at large values of @xmath , both
for @xmath and @xmath , we can estimate that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the extremal value of the action. The smallest nonzero
value of @xmath is @xmath . A particular instanton solution which
corresponds to this value is the following: @xmath , and @xmath form the
instanton solution for the @xmath sigma model with topological charge
equal one, @xmath for @xmath . Of course, we should integrate over all
solutions of this type. This will lead to a common multiplier in ( 9.44
) that does not affect the position of the Borel singularity. Higher
instanton solutions are built analogically. For the @xmath -th instanton
solution @xmath .

Substituting @xmath to ( 9.44 ) we obtain the positions of the Borel
singularities related to the instantons:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

The instanton solutions are not stable for @xmath ⁷ ⁷ 7 To show this we
can consider the one-parametric deformation @xmath , @xmath , where
@xmath is a constant unit vector which satisfies the condition @xmath .
The value of the action, @xmath interpolates monotonously between @xmath
and @xmath . . Naively we could think that an unstable solution is not a
local minimum of the action and therefore it does not lead to
nonperturbative corrections. However, there are examples from the
quantum mechanics which show that the situation is less trivial and that
unstable instantons may lead to the singularities in the Borel plane.

From our explicit calculation we observed for @xmath a leading
singularity in the Borel plane equal to @xmath . It is natural to
identify it with the instanton solution. For @xmath this singularity, if
present, is not a leading one and therefore cannot be seen from our
analysis. Thus we cannot conclude about the presence or absence of
nonperturbative corrections related to instantons for @xmath .

###### Renormalons.

Renormalon ambiguities do not correspond to any physical effects but
reflect an ambiguity in the definition of the asymptotic perturbative
expansion. It is believed that the ambiguities related to renormalons
can be fixed by proper definition of the subleading terms in the
operator product expansion. For a review of the subject see for example
[ 233 ] .

The renormalons in the @xmath sigma model were studied by David [ 234 ,
235 ] . For @xmath the @xmath sigma model is just an @xmath -component
gaussian field theory. It contains only UV renormalons at positions
@xmath with @xmath being negative integer. The @xmath corrections to the
large @xmath solutions suggest that for finite @xmath both UV and IR
renormalons are likely to be present. The IR renormalons are situated at
positions @xmath with @xmath being positive integer.

In view of this field theory prediction we can naturally interpret our
results in the following way. For @xmath we observe that the asymptotic
expansion is governed by the leading UV renormalon singularity at @xmath
. For finite @xmath there are two leading singularities: the UV
renormalon at @xmath and the IR renormalon at @xmath . The concurrence
of them is reflected in the nonsymmetrical with respect to the real axis
oscillating behavior of the coefficients of the expansion.

We see that the results about the large order behavior obtained from the
Bethe Ansatz are in accordance with the predictions of the field theory.
We got a new confirmation that the Bethe Ansatz correctly describes the
@xmath sigma model.

### Conclusions and discussions

The study of the AdS/CFT correspondence gave us an example of integrable
system with remarkable properties and posed new questions to answer in
the field of quantum integrable systems. In this thesis we described the
AdS/CFT integrable system in analogy with known integrable systems based
on the rational @xmath -matrix.

We saw that the symmetry group is always behind all the equations that
describe rational integrable systems, whether these are Bethe Ansatz
equations, fusion Hirota equations or integral equations for the
resolvents of the density functions.

It seems that the deepest way to describe an integrable system is to
consider the Hirota equations ( @xmath -system). Imposing different
requirements on the analytical structure of the transfer matrices we can
obtain different integrable systems, not necessarily based on the
rational @xmath -matrix. In this way the AdS/CFT system can be also
obtained.

It is not always simple to deal with the Hirota equations due to their
quadratic structure. We saw however that the @xmath -system is defined,
roughly speaking, by the ”exponentiation” of the functional equations
for the resolvents (compare ( 3.26 ) and ( 3.50 )). This resembles to
the description of the Lie group via its Lie algebra. The functional
equations for the resolvents are linear and are simple to investigate.
Therefore we may consider them as an indicator of the possible relations
among different integrable theories and then probably raise this
relation to the level of @xmath -systems.

For example, we saw that the structure of the functional equations for
the resolvents in the @xmath XXX spin chain is simple and is defined by
two deformed Cartan matrices (one for @xmath algebra and another for
@xmath algebra) ( 3.26 ). The excitations over the antiferromagnetic
vacuum in such a spin chain in the thermodynamic limit describe a
certain relativistic field theory. To see this we should perform a
particle-hole transformation which is very simple in the language of
functional equations. In this way we also see that an overall scalar
factor of the scattering matrix is defined basically by the inverse
deformed Cartan matrix of the @xmath algebra. The ”exponentiation” of
the functional equations through TBA leads to a @xmath -system which
remarkably coincides with the fusion relations for the transfer matrices
of the spin chain. This leads to a conjecture that transfer matrices of
a spin chain discretization coincide with the @xmath -functions which
appear in the TBA approach that describes the field theory.

Another example is the functional equations for the @xmath integrable
spin chains. We showed that whatever is the choice of the Kac-Dynkin
diagram, the functional equations are always organized into a fat hook
structure (more generally, @xmath -hook structure). Then, through the
TBA we get a @xmath -system defined on such fat hook (or @xmath -hook).
One should then ask what is the meaning of the obtained @xmath
-functions. Provided by proper boundary condition, the @xmath -system on
the fat hook is solved by the Bethe Ansatz equations through the chain
of Backlund transforms [ 40 ] ; the @xmath -functions have the meaning
of the transfer matrices of the corresponding spin chain [ 40 ] .
However the boundary conditions that allow Bethe Ansatz solution are not
the ones that are obtained through TBA, therefore relation between
@xmath -functions of TBA and transfer matrices is not clear.

In the @xmath -hook case the solution in terms of the Bethe equations is
still an open problem, though some progress was made in [ 108 ] . The
@xmath -hook case is more involved also because we do not know how to
identify the representations of the @xmath algebra with the points of
@xmath -hook.

The AdS/CFT integrable system which is much more complicated from the
first glance, in fact can be treated very similarly to the theories with
the rational @xmath -matrix. To show this in a more explicit way we may
use the kernels @xmath and @xmath defined respectively by ( 6.71 ) and (
6.61 ). These kernels are specially designed to treat the presence of
the square root cut. Using @xmath , we can rewrite the Bethe equations
in a more tractable form (see section 6.4 ). For example

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.46)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

We see the appearance of the rational structure in such notation.

As we showed in [ V3 ] , the solution of the crossing equations can be
also naturally formulated in terms of the kernel @xmath and the shift
operator @xmath . Using this representation for the dressing phase, we
can write down the functional representation of the BES and the BES/FRS
equations (as well as the other integral equations which follow from the
Beisert-Staudacher asymptotic Bethe Ansatz). It is particularly simple
to derive these functional equations directly from the Bethe Ansatz.

In the third part of the thesis we presented a way to perturbatively
solve the functional equations at strong coupling. The usefulness of the
functional representation is based first of all on the defining property
of the kernel @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

which allows performing various analytical transformations of the
functional equations. Such transformations of the BES equation at strong
coupling allow to reduce a problem to a simple functional equation (
8.19 ) which does not contain the kernel @xmath . The solution of ( 8.19
) was found by considering of the related Riemann-Hilbert problems in
two different scaling regimes and then identification of unknown
constants by comparing these two regimes.

We applied the same strategy for the solution of the BES/FRS equation
and for performing weak coupling asymptotic expansion of the energy of
the @xmath sigma model. When solving the latter problem we learned that
our approach can be reformulated in terms of the Wiener-Hopf solution of
the integral equations.

To a great extent, the AdS/CFT integrable system was sufficiently well
studied from the point of view of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. The
asymptotic Bethe Ansatz allows computation of the energy in the infinite
volume. Recent developments based on TBA allowed for study of finite
size operators [ 41 , 42 , 43 ] , [ 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 ] , [ 158 , 157 ]
, [ 161 , 236 ] . The anomalous dimension of the Konishi operator, the
simplest nontrivial finite-size operator, was found analytically at weak
coupling up to five loops [ 159 , 237 ] . This anomalous dimension was
also computed numerically up to a sufficiently large values of the
coupling constant [ 238 ] which allowed predicting first two orders of
the strong coupling expansion. Still, the analytic derivation at strong
coupling expansion is missing.

There is one intriguing question that can be asked on the level of the
asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. The integrable system as we know it now may be
an effective one and there it may be a different, probably much simpler
formulation. The one reason for this idea is that the integrable system
was built around a fast spinning string solution and we would rather
like to describe all possible states. This idea appeared soon after the
discovery of the all-loop integrability. In particular, in [ 155 ] it
was suggested that the @xmath sector can be described in terms of the
Hubbard model. This description turned out to be incorrect starting only
from four loops.

One probable answer to the question what is a simpler formulation is
just a @xmath -system constructed through TBA. Then we still should give
an interpretation for the @xmath -functions. We therefore come back to
the question if there a spin chain behind @xmath -hook. If such spin
chain exists, we can think about it as a discretization of the string
sigma model.

Another possibility is that the Zhukovsky cut appears effectively from
the condensation of particles from a hidden level. This idea was
formulated in [ 239 , 240 ] . In [ 241 ] it was shown on the classical
level of the sigma model that the central equation of the
Beisert-Staudacher Bethe Ansatz can be indeed reproduced by this
approach. The consideration of [ 241 ] was not however generalized to
the quantum level, also it is not evident how to include fermionic
interactions in this approach. We hope that the intuition developed in
our work can help to improve the study in this direction.

Let us finally recall recent promising formulation of the string sigma
model as a Pohlmeyer reduced theory [ 242 , 243 , 244 ] . This
formulation is relativistically invariant and describes excitations
around true vacuum. Therefore finding of the quantum integrable model
behind this theory would potentially give a desired simpler description
of the AdS/CFT system.

We see that despite a huge progress in recent years there are still many
questions to answer and that the study of integrability has many
directions to develop in the future.

### Note added

It is important to mention two papers that appeared after the defense of
this thesis.

In [ 245 ] the calculation of the generalized scaling function at
two-loops from the string theory was done. The result coincides with the
one of [ 48 , 37 ] . Before [ 245 ] string theory calculation [ 187 ]
was in disagreement with [ 48 , 37 ] as we discussed in this thesis.

In [ 246 ] certain infinite dimensional representations of @xmath were
identified with the nodes of the @xmath -hook plotted in Fig. 4.11 .
Hence, the @xmath -functions living on the @xmath -hook can be
interpreted as transfer matrices in these representations.

### Appendix A Conventions for action of the shift operator.

Throughout this text we often use the shift operator @xmath which is
defined in the following way:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

A usage of this operator can potentially lead to a number of
ambiguities. The goal of this appendix is to define the conventions
which will give a precise meaning to all the expressions that contain
the shift operator.

###### Analytical continuation.

When the function @xmath is multivalued, we should define in ( A.1 ) the
path that connects points @xmath and @xmath . The default definition is
the following. For @xmath a default set of branch cuts should be given.
Then the points @xmath and @xmath are to be connected by the path that
do not intersect the cuts.

Sometimes we need also an analytical continuation over the straight line
irrespectively if it crosses any cut or not. To denote this case we use
notations

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Correspondingly, if we want use the operator @xmath to make a shift by
@xmath and the shift must be made by analytical continuation over the
straight line, we use notations

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

The difference between ( A.1 ) and ( A.2 ) is shown in Fig. A.1

###### Function in the power of the operator.

For a given operator @xmath , by definition

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

For example

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

In most cases a choice of the branch of the logarithm is not important
since the logarithm is exponentiated. However, if an ambiguity may
appear we take a standard definition of the branch cut of the logarithm
and consider ( A.4 ) in the region of the variable @xmath where no
crossing of the logarithm cut occurs.

###### Rational function of the shift operator

Whenever the shift operator appears in the denominator, simultaneously
only positive or only negative powers of @xmath are allowed. Then the
denominator is understood as a power series assuming that @xmath or
@xmath is sufficiently small. For example:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

The definition makes sense if the action of ( A.6 ) on a function gives
a convergent series.

Note that according to this definition for example

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

Indeed,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

There is however one situation when we can use simultaneously @xmath and
@xmath in the denominator. That is when due to cancelations the actual
expression is a polynomial. An example is a definition of a ”D-number”

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is used for operations with string configurations (of Bethe roots)
of the length @xmath .

There is also one case when we formally deal with nonconvergent series.
Namely, we define

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

The reason for such definition is that the second derivative of the
logarithm of the formal equality ( A.10 ) gives a true equality.

For expressions of type

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a rational function we use the following definition.
First, we represent @xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

All the expressions used in the text allow such representation. The
expression @xmath should be understood as @xmath .

Then we define ( A.11 ) by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

From the definition ( A.13 ) of ( A.11 ) it follows that in general

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

However, since in all the cases presented in this text @xmath is a
convergent series, l.h.s. and r.h.s. of ( A.14 ) may differ only by a
constant:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

Throughout the text we track out this constant which is typically @xmath
. However, the essential information about algebraic structure of the
expression is contained in the argument @xmath of the exponent and
reader may not follow the preexponent constants.

### Appendix B Structure of the integral equations for the @xmath Bethe
ansatz.

Here we will derive the formula ( 4.27 ) and give an explicit form for
@xmath in ( 4.28 ).

Let us first consider the bosonic node. One can keep in mind the node 4
in Fig. 4.9 . However all the arguments are applicable for any node. The
Bethe equations are written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

If there are roots @xmath that are part of some stack configuration,
then the terms in ( B.1 ) which contain them will cancel against terms
with @xmath and/or @xmath belonging to the same stack. Therefore what is
left are the roots @xmath which form string configurations themselves.
These roots interact in a standard way with @xmath and @xmath and
therefore ( 4.27 ) is correct for bosonic node. This is because ( 4.27 )
is the same equation that appeared in @xmath case. It also happens that
part of @xmath roots belong to the end of the stack (type B in Fig. 4.8
if @xmath is bosonic or type C if @xmath is fermionic). Such roots
should be separated from other @xmath Bethe roots. The corresponding
node for such roots is joined to @xmath by the colorless (black) line
(in terms of Fig. 4.9 . For @xmath this node is below the node 4).

The fermionic Bethe roots generically form stacks of type B or C. Let us
derive the integral equations for the resolvents corresponding to these
stacks. The most general situation for the fermionic node is shown in
Fig. B.1 . We will also adopt numeration from this figure.

We introduce the following notations for the resolvents:

-   @xmath - resolvent for s-stack generated by the 0 node. If @xmath
    this is the type B stack. If @xmath - type C.

-   @xmath , @xmath - the resolvent of @xmath -string for the node
    @xmath .

-   @xmath , @xmath - the resolvents shown on the picture. Their meaning
    is slightly different depending on whether node @xmath is bosonic or
    fermionic.

    If the node @xmath is fermionic (case I) then @xmath is the
    resolvent for type C @xmath -stacks formed by the nodes @xmath and
    @xmath . @xmath is the resolvent for type C stacks terminated by the
    @xmath -string at the node @xmath .

    If the node @xmath is bosonic (case II) then @xmath is the resolvent
    for type C stacks terminated by the @xmath -string at the node
    @xmath , @xmath is the resolvent for type B stack terminated at the
    node @xmath , and @xmath is the resolvent for @xmath -strings of the
    node @xmath .

    The resolvents @xmath and @xmath and the corresponding Bethe roots
    enter the equations considered below in the same way independently
    of whether we deal with case I or II.

-   @xmath - the resolvent for @xmath -stacks originated by the node
    @xmath .

-   @xmath - the resolvent for @xmath -string if the node @xmath is
    bosonic, otherwise it is the resolvent for @xmath -stack originated
    at the node @xmath .

One have to prove the equations ( 4.27 ) for the @xmath -stacks
originated at the node 0. First we consider the case @xmath when the
considered stacks are of B-type. Using the notations of Sec. 1.3 one can
write Bethe equations for the center of this stack as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

The corresponding integral equations are

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

For @xmath one can apply @xmath operator on this equation. It is
straightforward to check that we reproduce ( 4.27 ) if @xmath satisfies

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

This is indeed the case since the bosonic nodes satisfy ( 4.27 ).

The marginal case @xmath gives the correct equations if we apply @xmath
and ( B.4 ) and define @xmath .

Now we consider the case @xmath (type C stacks). In this case the Bethe
equation for the center of the @xmath -stacks are written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

The corresponding integral equation is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.6)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

This equation is also valid for @xmath and coincides with ( B.3 ) for
the same value of @xmath . Therefore one can safely apply @xmath on (
B.6 ) for @xmath . This application leads again to ( 4.27 ).

The case @xmath should be treated separately. In this case for the
application of @xmath one need both equations ( B.3 ) and ( B.6 ). The
obtained integral equation will coincide with ( 4.27 ) if the following
equation holds:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

This equation is nothing than the integral equation for the simple Bethe
roots of @xmath node.

We are left with the special case when @xmath . In this case the same
considerations show that we again obtain ( 4.27 ) if the following
equation is correct

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

This is indeed the case.

Therefore we considered all possible cases and proved ( 4.27 ).

It is left to derive the integral equation for the corner point @xmath .
If the terminating node of the Kac-Dynkin diagram is fermionic than this
node will be exactly in the corner. One can think of it as the @xmath
node in Fig. B.1 (the @xmath node is absent in this case). Then it is
easy to see that the integral equations will be

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

or in the notations @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

The role of @xmath and @xmath can be interchanged depending on the
situation.

If the terminating node of the Kac-Dynkin diagram is a bosonic one, then
in the terms of Fig. B.1 there is no @xmath and @xmath node. The corner
resolvent will be @xmath . The integral equation for it is written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

We did not found a particularly nice equation that follows from the
given one.

### Appendix C Solution of the crossing equations in the mirror theory.

The goal of this appendix is to show how the solution [ V3 ] of the
crossing equations can be modified to be applicable in the mirror
theory. The mirror theory is the initial point for the construction of
the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz. It was formulated in [ 41 , 42 ] as the
analytical continuation of the physical theory. The dressing phase was
also found there as the analytical continuation. We would use a
different way and define the mirror theory from the bootstrap approach.
This would give us mirror crossing equations solution of which leads to
the mirror dressing phase.

While in the physical theory the physical region is defined by the
condition @xmath , in the mirror theory the physical region is defined
by the condition @xmath [ 42 ] . Therefore let us define a mirror
Jukowsky variable @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

for which condition @xmath is satisfied ¹ ¹ 1 Mirror Zhukovsky variables
where also used in [ 47 ] . Mirror and physical Zhukovsky variables are
related by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.2)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

The mirror theory is conjectured to be integrable. It has the same
symmetry algebra as the physical theory. Therefore we can apply the
bootstrap approach similarly as it was done for the physical theory. We
would get then the Bethe Ansatz equations with the central node equation
given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where dots stay for the interaction with the Bethe roots from nested
levels. This interaction as well as the nested Bethe equations are
exactly the same as in ( 6.41 ) except for the replacement @xmath .

The dressing phase @xmath does not coincide with the dressing phase of
the physical theory. We will now formulate the mirror crossing equations
which this dressing phase should satisfy. The crossing equations can be
derived by simple modification for the case of the mirror theory of the
approach of Janik [ 16 ] . These equations now read

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the @xmath stands for the analytical continuation over the contour
@xmath shown in Fig. C.1 . Note that @xmath is not the same contour as
was used for the crossing transformation in the physical theory. In
fact, @xmath .

Solution of ( C.4 ) undergoes the same steps as in the case of the
physical theory. The only difference is that instead of the cut @xmath (
@xmath ) we use the cut @xmath ( @xmath ). Therefore the solution of the
mirror crossing equations is given by the following expression:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is defined as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

Let us find the relation between physical dressing factor @xmath and the
mirror dressing factor @xmath . For this we first need establish the
relation between @xmath and @xmath . When @xmath has singularities only
in the lower half plane then

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.7)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

If @xmath has singularities only in the upper half plane then

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.8)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

If @xmath has singularities in the lower and the upper half planes then
we have to represent @xmath as a sum of two functions and then apply ( C
) and ( C.8 ).

By application of transformations ( C ) and ( C.8 ) to the mirror
dressing factor ( C.5 ) we obtain in the region @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (C.9)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Therefore equation ( C.3 ) can be also written in the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where ”an.cont.” means that expression in brackets is obtained by
analytical continuation from the region @xmath to the real values of
@xmath and @xmath . Except for this analytical continuation, the r.h.s.
of ( C.10 ) coincides with the r.h.s. of the Bethe Ansatz equation (
6.47 ) for the @xmath sector of the physical theory.

We are now at the point to compare our considerations with the results
obtained in the literature. The mirror theory was initially formulated
as analytical continuation of the physical theory, the mirror dressing
phase was defined not in the way that we define it here, but by the
analytical continuation of @xmath .

It was shown that the bound states of magnons in the mirror theory
appear for the excitations on the AdS [ 42 ] (in the physical theory
analogical bound states appeared for excitations on @xmath ), therefore
the @xmath sector was considered for the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. The
Bethe equations for this sector were given in the form ( C.10 ) [ 42 ] .
Then after studying of the mirror dressing phase and the dressing phase
for bound states obtained from fusion it was realized that the product
of the mirror dressing phase and the BDS factor @xmath has much simple
analytical properties [ 47 , 213 , 247 ] . The product of the mirror
dressing phase and the BDS factor was called in [ 213 ] the improved
dressing phase. A representation analogical to ( C.5 ) was first time
derived in [ 47 ] .

In our approach we define the mirror theory purely by the bootstrap
method and therefore without any reference to the physical theory. We
see that what is called in [ 213 ] the improved dressing phase is in
fact a true dressing phase of the mirror theory which follows from the
solution of the crossing equations ( C.4 ).

Let us finally comment on the dressing factor for the magnon bound
states. The magnon bound states from the point of view of the Bethe
Ansatz are string-type configurations [ 248 ] , exactly as in the case
of XXX spin chain. Using the notations of section 1.3 we can write down
the dressing factor for the interaction of @xmath -string and @xmath
-string as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then, using representation ( C.5 ) we can immediately see that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

In fact, the same derivation can be made in the physical theory. We have
just to replace @xmath with @xmath .

A word of caution should made here. Derivation of ( C.12 ) based on the
string configurations is not valid in the strip where Zhukovsky cut is
defined. This is a strip @xmath for the physical theory and @xmath for
the mirror theory. However, once the dressing factor ( C.12 ) is
established in the permitted region it can be smoothly continued to the
forbidden strips.

### Appendix D @xmath Heisenberg magnet. Technical details

The most general solution of ( 7.27 ) in the @xmath order is the
following

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (D.1)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

To fix the coefficients @xmath and @xmath we should consider the
following solution in the double scaling limit

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (D.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Comparison of large @xmath expansion of @xmath and one that follows from
( D.2 ) fixes the coefficients @xmath and @xmath to be

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (D.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

### Appendix E Mathematica code for asymptotic expansions

#### e.1 Derivatives of the gamma functions

For the calculation of the asymptotic expansion of the cusp anomalous
dimension and the energy density of the @xmath sigma model we need to
know the value of the following ratio:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (E.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

In principle we can evaluate this ratio using the code

            D[Gamma[x], {x, n}]/Gamma[x] // FunctionExpand // Expand           

However, this evaluation at large values of @xmath turns out to be the
most time consuming place in the whole recursive procedure. Therefore we
will present here a quicker code.

The code is based on the equality

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (E.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

and its consequence for @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (E.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

Using the fact that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (E.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the dots stay for the polynomial in @xmath with @xmath , we obtain
the recursive procedure to calculate ( E.1 ). The code for this
recursive procedure is the following:

    DG[a_,1] := DG[a,1] = D[Log[Gamma[a+x]],x]/. x->0//FunctionExpand;
    DG[a_,n_/;n>1] := DG[a, n]=
    (-1)^n Gamma[n]FunctionExpand@Zeta[n,a]-(D[Log[f[x]],{x,n}]/.f[x]->1
    /.Derivative[n][f][x]->0/.Derivative[m_][f][x]:>DG[m])//Expand;

Below we will use a slightly modified version of this code.

#### e.2 Cusp anomalous dimension

We reexpand the solution ( 8.23 ) in the double scaling limit ( 8.25 ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (E.5)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

The inverse Laplace transform of this series is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.6)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.7)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

From the other side, the solution in the double scaling limit @xmath is
given by ( 8.28 ):

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (E.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

Comparing ( E.6 ) and ( E.8 ) we see that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (E.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

The coefficients @xmath are expanded in the power series of @xmath ¹ ¹ 1
The recursion procedure that we build allows to express all the
coefficients as @xmath times a polynomial in @xmath ; @xmath due to (
E.15 ). :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using this expansion we can find the coefficient for the @xmath term in
( E.9 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the coefficient in the expansion

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since the l.h.s. of ( E.11 ) contains only nonpositive powers of @xmath
, we conclude that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

This gives us the recursion relation:

  -- -- -- --------
           (E.14)
  -- -- -- --------

This relation expresses ² ² 2 @xmath and @xmath are related by ( E.7 ).
@xmath in terms of @xmath with @xmath and @xmath with @xmath . Since
@xmath for @xmath , the recursion finally allows to express @xmath in
terms of @xmath . The latter cannot be found from the condition ( E.13
). It is fixed by the normalization condition ( 8.1 ) which implies that
the coefficients @xmath satisfy the constraint

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

The consequence of this constraint is that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

This completes the recursive procedure and it can be implemented in
Mathemtica . The code is the following:                G              
               = Gamma; ClearAll[a, F1, F2, F3, F4];              
               a[0, 0] = 1; a[0, k_ /; k < 0] = 0;              
               a[0, k_] := a[0, k] = - Sum[a[n, k - n] + a[-n, k - n], {n, 1, k}];

               FunctionExpand[(              
               G                              [1 + s/4]              
               G                              [n+s/4])/(              
               G

               G                              [s/4 - k])]/              
               G                              [k + 1];              
               F2[n_, p_, s_] :=  F2[n, p, s] =              
               FunctionExpand[              
               G                              [n + s/4]/              
               G              
               [n - p + s/4]];              
               F3[n_, p_, k_, s_] :=  F3[n, p, k, s] =              
               FunctionExpand[(              
               G                              [n + s/4]              
               G              
               [n + k - p + 1 + s/4])/(              
               G              
               [n + 1 + s/4 - p]                             
               G              
               [n + s/4 - p])]/              
               G                              [k + 1];              
               F4[n_, p_, k_, s_] :=  F4[n, p, k, s] =              
               FunctionExpand[(              
               G                              [n + s/4]              
               G              
               [1 + s/4 - n - k + p])/(              
               G              
               [n + 1 + s/4 - p]                             
               G              
               [n + s/4 - p])]/              
               G              
               [2 p + 1 - 2 n - k];              

    a[n_ /; n != 0, m_] :=  a[n, m] =  Block[{s = Sign[n], nn = Abs[n]},
      - Expand@Plus@@Expand/@{
      Sum[invT[s, nn + k] F1[nn, k, s] a[0, m - k], {k, 0, m}],
      Sum[invT[s, p] F2[nn, p, s] a[s (nn - p), m], {p, 1, nn - 1}],
      Sum[invT[s, p] F3[nn, p, k, s] a[s (nn+k-p),m-k],{k,1,m},{p,0,k+nn-1}],
      Sum[invT[s, p] F4[nn, p, k, s] a[-s(nn+k-p),m-k],{k,1,m},{p,0,k+nn-1}]}];

The function            invT[s, p]           encodes @xmath . A direct
way to evaluate it is
              invT[s_, p_] :=  invT[s, p] =  Expand@FunctionExpand@SeriesCoefficient[             
              If[s == 1,                            G             
              [3/4 - x/(2                            \[Pi]             
              )]/(                            G             
              [3/4]                            G             
              [1-x/(2                            \[Pi]             
              )]),                           
              G                            [1/4 - x/(2             
              \[Pi]                            )]/(             
              G                            [1/4]             
              G                            [1-x/(2             
              \[Pi]             
              )])], {x, 0, p}];             

Now we can find the coefficients @xmath for the expansion of the scaling
function:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

              ClearAll[f]; f[0] = 4; f[k_] := f[k] =             
              Expand@Sum[4 m ( a[m, k - m] - a[-m, k - m]), {m, 1, k}]             

###### Structure of the result and improvement of the code

The proposed above code for              invT[s,p]             allows
find the first 10 coefficients @xmath in about 20 seconds. The result
obtained in this way is however not well structured, its further
simplification is time consuming. Here we will give another code for
             invT[s,p]             that leads from the beginning to a
nice representation of the result.

We evaluate the derivatives of the gamma functions as was explained in
section E.1 . This evaluation is the recursive procedure with @xmath as
the input. In our case @xmath . For these particular values of @xmath we
have the following explicit expressions:

for @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.18)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

for @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.19)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

The ratios @xmath for even values of @xmath and @xmath for odd vales of
@xmath are rational numbers.

Let us look more carefully on the structure of the recursive procedure
which takes ( E.18 ) and ( E.2 ) as the input and gives @xmath as the
output. Each coefficient @xmath has an overall multiplier @xmath due to
the expansion over the combination @xmath . Except for this
multiplication all the operations which are involved in the recursive
procedure reduce to the polynomial combinations, with rational
coefficients, of ( E.18 ) and ( E.2 ).

###### Cancelation of logarithms and @xmath.

As was initially observed in [ 32 ] , the coefficients of the expansion
of the scaling function do not contain @xmath if to expand over the
shifted constant @xmath . The coefficients of the expansion also do not
contain @xmath . We checked these observations up to the tenth order and
will assume that they are true for arbitrary order. Using this
assumption and the rational structure of the recursive procedure, we can
put @xmath and @xmath in ( E.18 ).

###### The property of maximal transcendentality.

Let us assign the transcendentality @xmath to @xmath of odd argument and
to @xmath of even argument. We assign transcendentality 0 to @xmath and
to rational numbers. As we checked up to the tenth order and assume to
be true for any order, the coefficient @xmath of the expansion ( E.17 )
has the transcendentality @xmath which is the maximal possible
transcendentality at this order. This was initially observed also in [
32 ] . Due to this property we can leave only the terms with maximal
transcendentality in ( E.18 ) and ( E.2 ). We put @xmath in ( E.18 ) and
@xmath in ( E.2 ).

After these simplifications we can put @xmath in the combination @xmath
. Indeed, since @xmath is now the only place where @xmath appears,
@xmath becomes an overall multiplier and can be restored at the end of
the calculation ( @xmath should contain @xmath as an overall
multiplier).

Using these simplifications, we propose the following code for @xmath :

                            G             
              = Gamma;ClearAll[DG, DGp, D1G, invT];             

              DG[1] = 0; DGp[1] = 0; DG[0] = 1; DGp[0] = 1; D1G[0] = 1;             

              DG[n_ /; n > 1] := DG[n] = Expand[             

              (-1)^n                            G             
              [n] If[EvenQ[n],  0,             
              \[Zeta]             
              [n]] - (D[Log[h[x]], {x, n}]             

              /.h[x] -> 1/. Derivative[n][h][x] -> 0/. Derivative[m_][h][x] :> DG[m])];             

              DGp[n_ /; n > 1] := DGp[n] =  Expand[(-1)^n 4^n/2             
              G                            [n]             

              If[EvenQ[n], -             
              \[Beta]             
              [n], (1 - 2^-n)             
              \[Zeta]             
              [n]] - (D[Log[h[x]], {x, n}]             

              /. h[x] -> 1/. Derivative[n][h][x] -> 0/. Derivative[m_][h][x] :> DGp[m])];             
               D1G[n_ /; n > 0] := D1G[n] = Expand[D[1/h[x], {x, n}]              

              /. h[x] -> 1/. Derivative[m_][h][x] :> DG[m]];             

              invT[_, 0] = 1; invT[_, 1] = 0;             

              invT[1, p_ /; p >= 2] := invT[1, p] =             

              Expand@Sum[(-1/2)^p 1/(             
              G                            [r + 1]             
              G             
              [p - r + 1]) DGp[r] D1G[p - r],{r, 0, p}];             

              invT[-1, p_ /; p >= 2] := invT[-1, p] =             

              Expand@(invT[1, p] /.             
              \[Beta]                            [x_] -> (-             
              \[Beta]                            [x]));             

Now we can evaluate @xmath , using the improved definition of
              invT[s,p]              . For example, the first five
orders are given by
                 In=   Table[f[n]/\[Pi]^n, {n, 0, 4}]//Expand                

              Out=  {4, 0, -(              @xmath
              [2]/\[Pi]^2), -((27              @xmath
              [3])/32/\[Pi]^3),             

              -(2              @xmath
              [2]^2 + (21              @xmath
              [4])/4)/\[Pi]^4}             

The result coincides with the one given in [ 32 ] . This code allows to
calculate first 10 orders in few seconds and first 30 orders in half of
an hour.

#### e.3 Energy density of the @xmath sigma model

In chapter 9 we gave a general form of the perturbative expansion of the
resolvent in the large @xmath limit ( 9.25 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

We replace in ( E.21 ) @xmath with the double scaling variable @xmath ,
perform large @xmath expansion, and make the inverse Laplace transform (
9.28 ). To do these steps it is useful to represent @xmath as @xmath .
The result is:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (E.22)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

This expression should be equal to the solution in the double scaling
limit ( 9.3 ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.23)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

To obtain the expression of type ( E.3 ) we should perform a small
@xmath expansion of ( E.3 ). Before doing this let us rewrite the
argument of the exponent in @xmath in the following way:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

The asymptotic expansion of the energy density @xmath can be expressed
as @xmath times a power series in @xmath and @xmath . Due to the
expected renorm-group properties of the solution it is possible to
introduce a such coupling constant @xmath that this series will be
expressed as the power series of the coupling constant. Assuming this
property, which we checked up to 10 first orders, we replace @xmath with
zero. Below we give a more accurate explanation of this step.

Note that to derive the correct expansion of @xmath and @xmath in the
powers of @xmath and @xmath , given by ( 9.34 ) ³ ³ 3 We leave the
derivation of ( 9.34 ), which requires keeping the term @xmath , as an
exercise for a curious reader (see also formula (22) in [ V2 ] ). The
logic of the derivation remains the same, even if @xmath is present. ,
we cannot do the replacement @xmath . It is only admissible when our
goal is to express @xmath in terms of the coupling constant.

Within @xmath , expansion of ( E.3 ) at small @xmath leads to:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.25)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The requirement

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

unambiguously fixes the coefficients @xmath and @xmath in a recursive
way. To express @xmath in terms of @xmath and @xmath known from the
earlier steps of recursion we need to consider ( E.26 ) with @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath . To do the same for @xmath we need to consider ( E.26 )
with @xmath , @xmath , @xmath . The recursion procedure allows to
express @xmath and @xmath in terms of @xmath which is explicitly known.

Among all the equations ( E.26 ) with @xmath we use only those for which
@xmath . All the other equations with @xmath can serve for the
verification of the self-consistency of our solution.

The evaluation of the derivatives of the gamma-functions is made using
the trick of Sec. E.1 . As in the case of the cusp anomalous dimension,
a special structure of the answer allows to simplify this calculation.
As we observed up to tenth order, the coefficients of asymptotic
expansion are given in terms of zeta-functions of odd argument and
rational numbers only. Assuming that this property holds at any order,
we perform the following replacements in @xmath : @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath .

The Mathematica code for the recursive procedure is the following:

    (* Derivatives of the gamma functions *)
    ClearAll[DG, G, subs]; G = Gamma;
    subs = {_Log -> 0, EulerGamma -> 0, \[Pi] -> 0, Zeta -> \[Zeta]};
    DG[_, 0] = 1;
    DG[a_List, n_?IntegerQ /; n > 0] := DG[a, n] =
      Block[{f, y}, (Plus @@ FunctionExpand@ Flatten[
      {1, -1} D[Log@G@a, {x, n}] /. x -> 0] /. subs) -
      (D[Log[f[y]], {y, n}] /. f[y] -> 1 /. Derivative[n][f][y] -> 0
      /. Derivative[m_][f][y] :> DG[a, m]) // Expand]

    (* Definition of structure constants *)
    ClearAll[F, \[CapitalPhi], Vc, VQ, Q, c];
    F[n_, t_, k_, r_] := F[n, t, k, r] = ((-1)^k 2^(1-2 r))/G[r+1]Binomial[
      k, t](FunctionExpand[(G[1/2] G[-n+1/2-r])/G[n+1/2]/{
      G[-n+1/2-2r],G[-n+3/2-2r]}].{DG[{{-n+1/2-r},{-n+1/2-2r,n+1/2}}+x,k-t],
      2 r Mod[k, 2]DG[{{-n+1/2-r},{-n+3/2-2r,n+1/2}}+x,k-t]}) //  Expand;
    \[CapitalPhi][a_, b_] := \[CapitalPhi][a, b] =
      (1 - 2 \[CapitalDelta])^b/(G[b + 1] G[a - b + 1])DG[
      {{1 + 2 x \[CapitalDelta]}, {1/2 + x}}, a - b] // Expand;
    VQ[n_, 0, t_] := VQ[n, 0, t] =
      (2 (1 - 2 \[CapitalDelta])^t)/(G[t + 1] G[n - t + 1]) DG[
      {{1 + 2 x \[CapitalDelta]}, {3/2 + x}}, n - t] // Expand;

    (* Recursive procedure *)
    Vc[n_, m_, t_] := Plus @@ Flatten[Table[
      pc[n + r, m - r, k] F[n, t, k, r], {k, t, n + m}, {r, Max[0, -n], m}]
      /. If[n >= 0, pc[n, m, t] -> Pc, 0 -> 0] /.  pc -> c] // Expand;
    VQ[n_, m_, t_] := Plus @@ (
      Table[\[CapitalPhi][n+c+1,t]pQ[c,m-c-1],{c, Max[0, t - n - 1], m - 1}]
       /. If[n<0 && t==0, pQ[-n-1, m+n] -> PQ, 0 -> 0] /.pQ -> Q)//Expand;
    c[n_, m_, t_] := c[n, m, t] =
       Pc /. Solve[VQ[n, m, t] == Vc[n, m, t], Pc][[1]] // Expand;
    Q[a_, b_] := Q[a, b] =  PQ /. Solve[
       VQ[-a - 1, b + a + 1, 0] == Vc[-a - 1, b + a + 1, 0],PQ][[1]]//Expand

The energy density and the particle density represented in the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

can be evaluated using

    (* Energy and particle density *)
    ClearAll[ne, nr];
    ne[0] = nr[0] = 1;
    ne[n_] := ne[n] = Expand@Sum[2^(s + 1) Q[s, n - s - 1], {s, 0, n - 1}];
    nr[n_] := nr[n] = Expand[c[0, n, 0] - 2 c[0, n, 1]];

###### Expression in terms of the coupling constant.

We would like now to express the dimensionless ratio

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

in terms of the coupling constant defined in ( 9.11 ). At this step we
would like to better explain the substitution @xmath , therefore at the
moment we consider that the term @xmath is present. In terms of the
parameter @xmath , the coupling constant is defined as:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

Solving this equation perturbatively at large @xmath , we express @xmath
as a series in @xmath and @xmath . Expression ( E.28 ) is also given by
such series. We can treat @xmath as the independent (from @xmath )
parameter and reexpress ( E.28 ) in terms of @xmath . The expected
renorm-group dynamics predicts that all the @xmath terms cancel out.
Therefore we can put @xmath equal to any quantity. For simplicity
reasons we choose @xmath . Performing this replacement in ( E.29 )
includes one step which should be done carefully:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

Taking this into account, we get the following equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is valid modulo the terms proportional to @xmath ⁴ ⁴ 4 or to
@xmath that also cancel out from the final expression .

Substituting

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

to ( E.31 ), we find recursively the coefficients @xmath which allows us
to express ( E.29 ) in terms of @xmath and to find the coefficients
@xmath defined in ( 9.7 ). The Mathematica code for this procedure is
the following.

    M = 10;(* Maximal desired order *)
    a = \[Alpha]; ClearAll[b, Binv, Bdir, Bdird, Bdirreg];
    b[1] = 1; b[2] = -\[CapitalDelta];
    Binv[0] = 1; Bdirreg[0] = 1; Bdird[0] = 1;
    Binv[1] = Sum[b[n] a^n, {n, 1, M}] + O[a]^(M + 1);
    Bdir = Expand /@ (1/Binv[1]);
    Bdirreg[1] = 1/a + \[CapitalDelta] - Bdir;
    Bdird[1] = a Bdir - 1 + O[a]^(M - 1);
    Binv[n_] := Binv[n] = (Binv[n - 1] + O[a]^M) (Binv[1] + O[a]^M)
    Bdirreg[n_] := Bdirreg[n] =  Expand /@ (
      (Bdirreg[n - 1] + O[a]^(M - 2)) (Bdirreg[1] + O[a]^(M - 2)))
    Bdird[n_] :=  Bdird[n] =  Expand /@ (
      Bdird[n - 1] + O[a]^(M - 2)) (Bdird[1] + O[a]^(M - 2));

    left = Expand /@ Sum[nr[k] Binv[k], {k, 0, M - 2}] + O[a]^(M - 1);
    right = Expand /@ (Sum[FunctionExpand[Gamma[\[CapitalDelta]]/(
         Gamma[k + 1] Gamma[\[CapitalDelta] - k])] Bdird[k], {k, 0, M - 2}]
         Sum[Bdirreg[n]/Gamma[n + 1], {n, 0, M - 2}]);

    Do[b[n] =  b[n] /. Expand@ Solve[left[[3, n - 1]] == right[[3, n - 1]],
      b[n]][[1]], {n, 3, M}]

    nra = Expand /@ Sum[nr[k] Expand /@ Binv[k], {k, 0, M}];
    nea = Expand /@ Sum[ne[k] Expand /@ Binv[k], {k, 0, M}];
    answer = Expand /@ (Binv[1] nea/nra^2);

The first few coefficients @xmath are given by:

    chi[n_] := answer[[3, n]] // Expand
    Table[chi[n],{n,3,6}]

With this code @xmath can be found in less then one minute using a
single core at 2Ghz. To get the expression for @xmath approximately 20
hours is needed.
