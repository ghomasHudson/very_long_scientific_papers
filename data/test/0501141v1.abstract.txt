The Brownian Web (BW) is a family of coalescing Brownian motions
starting from every point in space and time @xmath . It was first
introduced by Arratia, and later analyzed in detail by TÃ³th and Werner.
More recently, Fontes, Isopi, Newman and Ravishankar gave a
characterization of the BW, and general convergence criteria allowing
either crossing or noncrossing paths, which they verified for coalescing
simple random walks. Later Ferrari, Fontes, and Wu verified these
criteria for a two dimensional Poisson Tree. In both cases, the paths
are noncrossing. In this thesis, we formulate new convergence criteria
for crossing paths, and verify them for non-simple coalescing random
walks satisfying a finite fifth moment condition. This is the first time
convergence to the BW has been proved for models with crossing paths.
Several corollaries are presented, including an analysis of the scaling
limit of voter model interfaces that extends a result of Cox and
Durrett.
