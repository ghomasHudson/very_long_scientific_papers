We present algorithms for route planning in road and public transit
networks, as well as in combined networks.

Therefore, we explore the nearest neighbor and shortest path problem and
propose solutions based on Cover Tree s, ALT and CSA .

Further, we illustrate the theory behind the algorithms, give a short
overview of other techniques, present experimental results and compare
the techniques with each other.
