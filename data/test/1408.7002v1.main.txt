## Chapter 1 Introduction

This thesis concerns the characterization of quantum statistics on
graphs. Naturally, one should first explain what it means. As with many
problems in mathematical physics it is hard to do it in a one sentence.
However, in the subsequent sections of the introduction it is done. The
subject, as I see it, is inevitably connected to some basic concepts in
algebraic topology and graph theory. The main purpose of this, rather
short, introduction is to persuade the reader that quantum statistics
and the first homology group of an appropriate configuration space are
one and the same thing. I knowingly avoid using the full formalism of
quantum mechanics on non-simply connected spaces. This can be found in
many textbooks and in my opinion is not relevant to understand the
problem and the main results of the thesis. Writing this text I tried to
minimize the number of irrelevant details so that the key ideas and
concepts were clearly visible. Therefore, for example, I do not prove
theorems whose proofs do not contribute to the understanding of the main
flow of the text. The interested reader is asked to consult the cited
references. On the other hand, in order to make the manuscript available
to a reader not familiar with homology groups and graph theory I include
a basic discussion of the relevant facts. Although one can find it
unnecessary, from time to time, I repeat definitions and key properties
of some important objects. I believe that it is better to do this rather
than to send the reader to a distant page where they were discussed for
the first time.

The chapter is organized as follows: In section 1.1 I shortly explain
the concept of quantum statistics describing two approaches. The first
one is standard and the second topological. Then in section 1.2 the
Aharonov-Bohm effect is discussed as an example of a topological phase.
The subsequent five sections contain the discussion of basic properties
of graphs, cell complexes and their homotopy and homology groups. Next,
in section 1.8 I define the many-particle configuration space and
explain that its first homology group encodes the information about
quantum statistics. The calculation for the case of particles living in
@xmath and @xmath , where @xmath is included. Then in section 1.9 I
generalize the above concept to graphs and introduce the basic
mathematical object of this thesis, i.e. the discrete configuration
space of @xmath -particles, @xmath . This space has the structure of a
cell complex and is topologically equivalent to the configuration space
of @xmath -particles on a graph, @xmath . In the last section of this
chapter I discuss the tight-binding model of @xmath -particles on a
graph, define the topological gauge potentials and explain the
connection between them, the first homology and quantum statistics. The
background material of the introduction is mostly based on [ 38 ] and [
45 ] .

### 1.1 Quantum statistics

In this section I describe two approaches to quantum statistics. The
first one introduces it as an additional postulate of quantum mechanics.
The second, which I will follow throughout the thesis, is topological in
its nature.

#### 1.1.1 Standard approach to quantum statistics

In quantum mechanics any quantum system is described by its underlying
Hilbert space. Let us denote by @xmath the one-particle Hilbert space,
i.e. the Hilbert space of a single particle. By one of the postulates of
quantum mechanics the Hilbert space of @xmath distinguishable particles,
@xmath , is the tensor product of the Hilbert spaces of the
constituents, i.e.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If we want to treat particles as indistinguishable some additional
modifications of @xmath are required. First, the indistiguishability
implies that all observables need to commute with permutations of the
particle labels. Therefore, one decomposes @xmath into irreducible
representations of the permutation group @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath labels those representations. The components @xmath
represent essentially different permutation symmetries. Note that a
priori all components @xmath are equally good, i.e. none of them is
distinguished in any way. The distinction between them is due to
symmetrization postulates of quantum mechanics, i.e. physically
realizable components @xmath are only

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which are trivial and sign representations of the permutation group
@xmath , respectively. The first one corresponds to bosons and the
second to fermions. Other components or equivalently other
representations of @xmath are physically excluded. In order to decide if
the considered particles obey Bose or Fermi statistics one looks at the
spin. The spin-statistics theorem [ 40 ] says that particles with
integer spin are bosons and with half-integer, fermions. It is worth
mentioning that at the level of non-relativistic quantum mechanics the
spin-statistics theorem is actually a postulate as it is proved only in
the framework of quantum filed theory. Nevertheless, there were attempts
to deduce it on the level of QM (see for example [ 12 ] ). The
antisymmetric property of fermionic states is also known as the Pauli
exclusion principle which says that no two identical fermions may occupy
the same quantum state simultaneously. Finally, let us mention that
symmetrization postulate has an important consequences if one looks at
the energy distribution of many non-interacting particles. More
precisely, assume that we have a collection of non-interacting
indistinguishable particles and ask how they occupy a set of available
discrete energy states. Then the expected number of particles in the
@xmath -th energy state is given by:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where, @xmath is temperature, @xmath is Boltzmann constant and @xmath is
the degeneracy of the @xmath energy state.

#### 1.1.2 Topological approach to quantum statistics

After discussing the standard way of introducing quantum statistics we
switch to the topological approach. Interestingly, it is based on the
topological properties of the classical configuration space.

In classical mechanics, particles are considered distinguishable.
Therefore, the @xmath -particle configuration space is the Cartesian
product, @xmath , where @xmath is the one-particle configuration space.
By contrast, in quantum mechanics elementary particles may be considered
indistinguishable. This conceptual difference in the description of
many-body systems prompted Leinaas and Myrheim [ 36 ] (see also [ 44 ,
46 ] ) to study classical configuration spaces of indistinguishable
particles, @xmath which led to the discovery of anyon statistics. We
first briefly describe the work of Leinaas and Myrheim.

As noted by the authors of [ 36 ] indistinguishability of classical
particles places constraints on the usual configuration space, @xmath .
Configurations that differ by particle exchange must be identified. One
also assumes that two classical particles cannot occupy the same
configuration. Consequently, the classical configuration space of @xmath
indistinguishable particles is the orbit space

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath corresponds to the configurations for which at least two
particle are at the same point in @xmath , and @xmath is the permutation
group. Significantly, the space @xmath may have non-trivial topology. As
permuted configurations are identified in @xmath any closed curve in
@xmath corresponds to a process in which particles start at some
configuration and then return to the same configuration modulo they
might have been exchanged. Some of these curves are non-contractible and
therefore the space @xmath has nontrivial fundamental group @xmath .

##### Quantum mechanics on non-simply connected configuration spaces

For many (or just one particle) whose classical configuration space
@xmath is non-simply connected quantum mechanics allows an additional
freedom stemming from the non-triviality of the fundamental group @xmath
. In order to describe this freedom we assume in the following that all
particles are free, i.e. there are no external fields and on the
classical level they do not interact. In the subsequent section we
discuss in details the Aharonov-Bohm effect which is an example of the
general concept we describe here.

Let @xmath be a connection @xmath -form of a @xmath -dimensional vector
bundle over @xmath with the structure group @xmath (see [ 38 ] for more
details). As we do not want to affect classical mechanics, we assume
that the curvature @xmath -form @xmath vanishes. In the following we
will need the notion of the holonomy group. Let @xmath be a closed
curve. As we consider @xmath -dimensional vector bundle, over any point
of @xmath there is a @xmath -dimensional vector space @xmath . For any
vector @xmath over the point @xmath we consider the parallel transport
through @xmath . The result of this process is vector @xmath . Notably
@xmath and @xmath need not to be the same. Therefore to each loop one
can assign a matrix @xmath which depends only on the loop and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The collection of all matrices @xmath for all loops based at some fixed
point @xmath is called the holonomy group. Moreover, when @xmath ,
@xmath depends only on the homotopy type of the loop. Therefore holonomy
group is a @xmath -dimensional representation of the fundamental group
(see section 1.4 for definition of fundamental group). When @xmath this
representation is abelian and assigns phase factors to non-contractible
loops in @xmath . When @xmath it assigns in general non-commuting
unitary matrices to non-contractible loops in @xmath . Finally, these
matrices act on @xmath -component wavefunction.

##### Classical configuration spaces and quantum statistics

In 1977 Leinaas and Myrheim [ 36 ] considered the classical
configuration space of @xmath indistinguishable particles, @xmath in the
above described context. Their work showed that the representations of
the fundamental group @xmath determine all possible quantum statistics.
In particular they described in details the cases when @xmath and @xmath
, where @xmath . Notably for @xmath they found that the fundamental
group is the braid group which led to the discovery of anyon statistics.
Similar results were obtained by Laidlaw and DeWitt [ 35 ] who
considered the problem of quantum statistics using the language of path
integrals. As clearly pointed out by Dowker [ 17 ] when one is
interested in the abelian quantum statistics only, determination of the
fundamental group is not actually necessary. Instead, the first homology
group which is the abelianized version of @xmath plays the major role.
In this thesis we determine it for graph configuration spaces.

### 1.2 Aharonov-Bohm Effect as an example of topological phase

In this section we discuss the Aharonov-Bohm effect. In particular we
explain the topological nature of the phase gained by the wavefunction
when it goes around the magnetic flux. Our exposition mainly follows [
13 ] .

In non-relativistic quantum mechanics the canonical commutation
relations for a free particle living in @xmath -dimensional space @xmath
are given by:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath . The standard representation of position and momenta
operators satisfying ( 1.2.1 ) is given by:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It was perhaps first noticed ¹ ¹ 1 According to authors of [ 13 ] . by
Dirac [ 16 ] , that operators:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

satisfy the canonical commutation relations, i.e.

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

as well. When the configuration space @xmath has the trivial topology,
e.g. @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Therefore, using gauge freedom, i.e. @xmath it is possible to remove
@xmath from @xmath . To this end, note that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

On the other hand, when configuration space has a non-trivial topology
the implication given by ( 1.2.6 ) does not hold and it is not possible
to use the above argument. Before discussing the Aharonov-Bohm effect
which is, in some sense, a manifestation of this phenomenon we first
focus on a more general situation. The operators @xmath are generators
of translation and when @xmath one has

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It is easy to verify that when transporting the state vector @xmath
along curve @xmath we get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Therefore for a closed loop @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.2.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Let us consider two situations when @xmath and when @xmath , where
@xmath is a disk of radius @xmath (see figures 1.1 (a) and 1.1 (b),
respectively). For the first case the loop @xmath is contractible and we
have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.2.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

For figure 1.1 (b), that is, when the disk @xmath is removed from the
domain contained inside the loop @xmath , i.e. when @xmath we have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.2.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and hence the phase @xmath in equation ( 1.2.9 ) might be non-zero. For
a general loop @xmath which goes around the disk @xmath clockwise @xmath
times and anticlockwise @xmath times one gets

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.2.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As a conclusion we see that in certain topologies it does matter which
definition of momentum operators ( 1.2.2 ) or ( 1.2.3 ) we use. On the
other hand, it is also clear that the differential @xmath -form @xmath
should be taken into account only if it has some physical meaning. From
a physics perspective the simplest example of such physical realization
is the magnetic field whose potential @xmath is a connection @xmath
-form. Recall, that by the minimal coupling principle, in the presence
of a magnetic field @xmath all derivatives in all equations of physics
should be substituted by covariant derivatives. Thus

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Therefore the magnetic potential @xmath plays the role of @xmath from
the previous considerations. Let us next consider the situation shown in
figure 1.2 . We assume

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The phase @xmath is called the Aharonov-Bohm phase and is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

i.e. it is proportional to the flux @xmath of the magnetic field @xmath
through the disk @xmath . The existence of this phase was experimentally
verified in 1960 [ 15 ] by measuring the shift in the interference
pattern of the electrons in the geometry which is almost identical with
the one shown in figure 1.2 . Finally, let us note that the existence of
the Aharonov-Bohm phase is inevitably related to the non-contractibility
of the loop through which electrons travel. Thus for graphs, we will
call the phase gained by a particle going around the cycle an
Aharonov-Bohm phase (see chapter 2 for more details).

### 1.3 Graphs

In this section we introduce the notion of graphs and discuss their
basic properties. A graph @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath are finite
sets, is a collection of @xmath points called vertices and @xmath edges
which connect some of the vertices. We will write @xmath ( @xmath ) if
two vertices @xmath are connected (not connected) by an edge,
respectively. An undirected edge between @xmath and @xmath will be
denoted by @xmath . Similarly a directed edge from @xmath to @xmath (
@xmath to @xmath ) will be denoted by @xmath ( @xmath ). In the
following we will consider only simple graphs, i.e. graphs for which any
pair of vertices is connected by at most one edge (there are no multiple
edges) and each edge is connected to exactly two different vertices
(there are no loops). A typical way to encode the information about
connections between vertices of @xmath is by means of the so-called
adjacency matrix. The adjacency matrix of @xmath is a @xmath matrix such
that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and @xmath otherwise. If vertices @xmath and @xmath are connected by an
edge, i.e. if @xmath , we say they are adjacent. It is straightforward
to see that @xmath .

#### 1.3.1 Subgraphs, paths, trees and cycles

Here we assume that @xmath is a simple connected graph. A subgraph
@xmath of the graph @xmath is a graph such that @xmath , @xmath and
edges from @xmath connect vertices from @xmath . There are two
elementary methods for constructing a subgraph out of the given graph.
For @xmath one can consider a graph with @xmath edges obtained from
@xmath by deletion of the edge @xmath . It will be denoted by @xmath .
Similarly for a vertex @xmath one defines graph @xmath which is a result
of deleting vertex @xmath together with all the edges connected to
@xmath . The generalization of these procedures to many edges or
vertices is straightforward.

We proceed with definitions of other important subgraphs: paths, cycles
and trees.

###### Definition 1.3.1.

A path @xmath on @xmath is a subgraph of @xmath such that @xmath .

We will call the vertices @xmath of path @xmath the internal vertices. A
path @xmath will be called a simple path if @xmath for any @xmath .

###### Definition 1.3.2.

A cycle @xmath on @xmath is a subgraph of @xmath such that @xmath and
@xmath .

###### Definition 1.3.3.

A tree @xmath of @xmath is a subgraph of @xmath such that any pair of
vertices is connected by exactly one path.

Equivalently, @xmath is a tree if it contains no cycles. Among all trees
of @xmath we distinguish the so-called spanning trees . A spanning tree
@xmath of @xmath is a tree such that its set of vertices is exactly the
set of vertices of @xmath , i.e. @xmath . Therefore, a spanning tree is
a maximal subgraph of @xmath without cycles. In order to calculate the
number of cycles of a given graph @xmath we note that any spanning tree
of @xmath has @xmath edges. Therefore, the number of cycles is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This number, which is called the first Betti number, will play a major
role in the next chapters.

#### 1.3.2 Connectivity

In this section we discuss the notion of connectivity of a graph. We
start with the definition of a connected graph.

###### Definition 1.3.4.

A graph is connected, if any pair of its vertices is connected by a
path.

In the following we will need the notion of @xmath -connected graphs.
Note at the beginning that after the removal of a vertex (or vertices)
from @xmath , the graph @xmath can split into several disjoint connected
components (see figure 1.4 (b)). The topological closures of connected
components of @xmath will be called topological components or, if it
does not cause ambiguity, just components (see figure 1.4 (c) for an
intuitive definition of the topological closure).

The definition of @xmath -connected graph is closely related to this
notion, i.e.

###### Definition 1.3.5.

A graph @xmath is @xmath -connected, where @xmath , if @xmath and @xmath
is connected for any set @xmath with @xmath .

In definition 1.3.5 the graph @xmath should be understood as a graph
obtained from @xmath by removal of vertices @xmath as explained in
section 1.3.1 . Moreover, we assume that every graph is @xmath
-connected. Note also that by definition 1.3.5 all connected graphs are
@xmath -connected. We next define the connectivity of a graph.

###### Definition 1.3.6.

The connectivity of @xmath , @xmath , is the greatest integer @xmath
such that @xmath is @xmath -connected.

Note that the definition of @xmath -connected graph is phrased in terms
of vertex removals rather than in terms of paths joining pairs of
vertices. In order to link it with paths we first define independent
paths between pairs of vertices.

###### Definition 1.3.7.

Two (or more) paths between vertices @xmath and @xmath of @xmath are
independent if they do not have common inner vertices (see figure 1.5 ).

The following Menger’s theorem [ 45 ] gives the characterization of
@xmath -connected graphs in terms of independent paths.

###### Theorem 1.3.8.

A graph is @xmath -connected if and only if there are @xmath independent
paths between any two of its vertices.

#### 1.3.3 Decomposition of a graph into @xmath-connected components

As we will see in the next sections, the characterisation of quantum
statistics on graphs requires an understanding of the decomposition of a
graph into @xmath -connected components. We start with the definition of
a cut.

###### Definition 1.3.9.

A cut @xmath of a graph @xmath is a set of vertices such that @xmath is
disconnected, that is, it consists of at least two components.

We will say that @xmath is an @xmath -cut if @xmath . We next introduce
the notion of a block of the graph.

###### Definition 1.3.10.

A block is a maximal connected subgraph without a @xmath -cut.

Note that by definition 1.3.10 any block is either a maximal @xmath
-connected subgraph or a single edge. For example, if @xmath is a tree
then its blocks are precisely the edges. Having a @xmath -connected
simple graph one can consider the set of its @xmath -cuts. For each
@xmath -cut we can further consider its topological components. Next for
each component, if possible we apply the remaining @xmath -cuts.
Repeating this process iteratively we arrive with topological components
which are either @xmath -connected or given by edges. This way we
decompose a @xmath -connected graph into the set of @xmath -connected
components and edges, which are in fact the blocks of the considered
graph (see figure 1.6 for an example of this kind of decomposition). It
can be shown that the decomposition is unique [ 45 ] .

If the @xmath -connected components obtained from the above
decomposition are not @xmath -connected they can be further decomposed
into the set of @xmath -connected components and perhaps cycles. This is
done by considering the set of @xmath -cuts. For each @xmath -cut @xmath
we take all its topological components. In order to ensure that these
components are @xmath -connected we add an additional edge between
vertices @xmath and call them the marked components . Repeating this
process iteratively we arrive at marked components which are either
@xmath -connected or topological cycles (see figure 1.7 for an example
of this kind of decomposition). Although the final set of marked
components is typically not unique, one can show that the numbers of
@xmath -connected components and cycles do not depend on the order in
which one applies @xmath -cuts.

### 1.4 The fundamental group

In this section we introduce the fundamental group of a topological
space. As we will see, up to continuous deformations, the elements of
this group are loops of the considered space.

Let @xmath be a topological space. A path in @xmath is a continuous map
@xmath . Consider the family of paths @xmath , where @xmath and:

-   the endpoints @xmath and @xmath are fixed, i.e. do not depend on
    @xmath ,

-   the map @xmath , that is the map @xmath is continuous.

The family satisfying these conditions is called a homotopy of paths in
@xmath .

###### Definition 1.4.1.

Two paths @xmath and @xmath with fixed endpoints, i.e. @xmath and @xmath
, are homotopic if they can be connected by a homotopy of paths.

The homotopy equivalent paths will be denoted by @xmath . One can show
that the relation of homotopy of paths with fixed points, i.e. @xmath is
an equivalence relation and therefore divides paths into disjoint
classes. We next define the product of two paths.

###### Definition 1.4.2.

Let @xmath be such that @xmath . The product path @xmath is the path
given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It is easy to see that the product of paths behaves well with respect to
homotopy classes of paths, i.e. if @xmath and @xmath then @xmath .

Let us next consider loops, that is paths whose starting and ending
points are the same (we call it basepoint). We denote by @xmath the set
of all homotopy classes of loops with basepoint @xmath . One can show
that @xmath is a group with respect to the product of homotopy classes
of loops defined by @xmath called the fundamental group of @xmath at the
basepoint @xmath . Moreover, if two basepoints @xmath and @xmath lie in
the same path-component of @xmath the groups @xmath and @xmath are
isomorphic. Therefore for path-connected spaces we often write @xmath
instead of @xmath .

We next describe the fundamental group of a simple connected graph ² ² 2
The topology we use is a topology of a cell complex which is defined in
section 1.5 . Let @xmath be a spanning tree of @xmath . Choose @xmath to
be any vertex of @xmath (hence of @xmath ). Each edge @xmath of @xmath ,
which we will call a deleted edge, defines a loop in @xmath . To see
this note that there is a unique simple path joining @xmath with each of
the endpoints of @xmath . The announced loop, which we denote by @xmath
, starts from @xmath goes through the path in @xmath to one of the
endpoints of @xmath , then through @xmath and then returns to @xmath
across the path in @xmath . The homotopy classes of these loops generate
@xmath . More precisely:

###### Theorem 1.4.3.

Let @xmath be a connected simple graph and @xmath its spanning tree.
Then the fundamental group @xmath is a free group whose basis is given
by classes @xmath corresponding to deleted edges @xmath .

### 1.5 Cell complexes

An example of a topological space is a cell complex which we discuss in
the following.

Let @xmath be the standard unit-ball. The boundary of @xmath is the
unit-sphere @xmath . A cell complex @xmath is a nested sequence of
topological spaces

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.5.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the @xmath ’s are the so-called @xmath - skeletons defined as
follows:

-   The @xmath - skeleton @xmath is a discrete set of points.

-   For @xmath , the @xmath - skeleton @xmath is the result of attaching
    @xmath - dimensional balls @xmath to @xmath by gluing maps

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (1.5.2)
      -- -------- -- ---------

By @xmath -cell @xmath we understand the interior of the ball @xmath
attached to the @xmath -skeleton @xmath . We will denote by @xmath the
cell @xmath together with its boundary. The @xmath -cell is regular if
its gluing map is an embedding (i.e., a homeomorphism onto its image).
Finally we say that @xmath is @xmath -dimensional if @xmath is the
highest dimension of the cells in @xmath .

Notice that every simple graph @xmath can be treated as a regular cell
complex with vertices as @xmath -cells and edges as @xmath -cells. If a
graph contains loops, these loops are irregular @xmath -cells (the two
points that comprise the boundary of @xmath are attached to a single
vertex of the @xmath -skeleton). The product @xmath inherits a
cell-complex structure; its cells are cartesian products of cells of
@xmath .

### 1.6 Homology groups

In this section we define homology groups, @xmath over the integers of
the @xmath -dimensional cell complex @xmath . As we will always speak
about integer homology we will often write @xmath instead of @xmath .

The construction of homology groups goes in several steps which we now
describe. First, we assign an arbitrary orientation on the cells of
@xmath . Let @xmath be the number of @xmath -cells in @xmath . The
oriented @xmath -cells will be denoted by @xmath . The @xmath -chain is
a formal linear combination

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.6.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where coefficients @xmath are integers. We denote by @xmath the set of
all @xmath -chains. This set can be given the structure of an abelian
group. The addition in this group is defined by

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                                
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

In fact @xmath is isomorphic to the direct sum of @xmath copies of
@xmath , i.e. @xmath . We next consider the boundary map

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.6.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which assigns to an oriented @xmath -cell @xmath its boundary (see [ 25
] for a discussion on boundary maps). The boundary map satisfies @xmath
, that is the boundary of the boundary is zero. This way we arrive at
the chain complex @xmath , that is a sequence of abelian groups @xmath
connected by boundary homomorphisms @xmath , such that that composition
of any two consecutive maps is zero @xmath . The standard way to denote
a chain complex is the following:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.6.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Let us denote by @xmath and @xmath the kernel and the image of the
boundary map @xmath . The elements of @xmath are called @xmath -cylces
and the elements of @xmath are called @xmath -boundaries. The @xmath -th
homology group is defined as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.6.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

so it is a quotient space of @xmath -cycles by @xmath -boundaries.

We next present an example of a calculation of homology groups, i.e. we
calculate the first homology group of the @xmath -torus, @xmath . To
this end we consider the cell complex @xmath shown in figure 1.9 . In
fact, this is the simplest triangularization of @xmath . The cell
complex @xmath consists of two @xmath -cells, three @xmath -cells and
one @xmath -cell, i.e.

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.6.5)
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- ---------

Therefore we have the following chain complex

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.6.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In order to calculate @xmath we need to calculate the kernel and the
image of boundary maps @xmath and @xmath respectively. Taking into
account the orientation denoted in figure 1.9 we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.6.7)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- ---------

Therefore

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.6.8)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- ---------

Using ( 1.6.4 ) one easily sees that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.6.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We finish this section by making a statement about the connection
between the first homology group @xmath and the fundamental group @xmath
. This connection is based on the fact that the map @xmath can be viewed
as either a path or a @xmath -cell. Moreover if @xmath represents a loop
the considered @xmath -cell is a cycle. We need to first define the
commutator subgroup of @xmath .

Let @xmath be a group and denote by @xmath its identity element. The
commutator of two elements @xmath is defined as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.6.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Note that @xmath if and only @xmath . The subgroup generated by all
commutators of @xmath , which we denote by @xmath , is a normal subgroup
of @xmath . To se this note that if @xmath and @xmath then @xmath . By
normality of @xmath the quotient @xmath is a group. This group is called
abelianization of @xmath as it is necessarily abelian. In fact if group
@xmath is abelian itself then @xmath .

The following theorem relates @xmath to @xmath

###### Theorem 1.6.1.

The first homology group @xmath is the abelianization of the fundamental
group @xmath

By theorem 1.4.3 the fundamental group of a connected graph @xmath is a
free group generated by loops through the deleted edges. Combining this
result with theorem 1.6.1 one easily obtains

###### Theorem 1.6.2.

The first homology group @xmath of a graph @xmath is @xmath , where
@xmath is the number of independent cycles of @xmath given by formula
1.3.2 .

### 1.7 Structure theorem for finitely generated Abelian groups

Homology groups of a finite cell complex @xmath are finitely generated
Abelian groups. Therefore, in this section we discuss the structure
theorem for these kind of groups.

#### 1.7.1 Finitely generated Abelian groups

Let @xmath be an Abelian group. We put @xmath as the neutral element of
@xmath and @xmath denotes the inverse of @xmath . For @xmath and @xmath
we put

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It is easy to see that for any chosen @xmath the set of elements

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.7.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is the subgroup of @xmath generated by @xmath . We say that @xmath are
linearly independent if @xmath if and only if @xmath .

###### Definition 1.7.1.

A group @xmath is a finitely generated Abelian group if and only if
there are elements @xmath such that @xmath . Moreover, if the generating
elements can be chosen to be linearly independent the group @xmath is a
finitely generated free abelian group isomorphic to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.7.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The number @xmath is called the rank of @xmath .

For a finitely generated Abelian group which is not free there are some
relations between generating elements. In order to describe these
relations we will need the following

###### Theorem 1.7.2.

Let @xmath be a finitely generated free abelian group of rank @xmath and
@xmath a subgroup. There always exists choice of generators @xmath ,
@xmath in @xmath such that @xmath , i.e. @xmath can be expressed in the
form:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.7.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath and @xmath and @xmath .

The structure theorem of an arbitrary finitely generated Abelian group
reads:

###### Theorem 1.7.3.

Let @xmath be a finitely generated Abelian group. Then

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.7.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath for all @xmath .

###### Proof.

Let @xmath be generating elements of @xmath . The map

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.7.5)
     @xmath      (1.7.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is a surjective homomorphism between Abelian groups and therefore by the
first isomorphism theorem @xmath . But the kernel of @xmath is a
subgroup of @xmath . By theorem 1.7.2

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.7.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for some @xmath . Hence,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.7.8)
     @xmath      (1.7.9)
     @xmath      (1.7.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath . ∎

### 1.8 Topology of configuration spaces and quantum statistics

In this section we define configuration spaces, discuss their basic
properties and relate them to quantum statistics.

Let us denote by @xmath the one-particle classical configuration space
(e.g., an @xmath -dimensional manifold) and by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.8.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

the space of @xmath distinct points in @xmath . The @xmath -particle
configuration space is defined as an orbit space

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.8.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the permutation group of @xmath elements and the action
of @xmath on @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.8.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Any closed loop in @xmath represents a process in which particles start
at some particular configuration and end up in the same configuration
modulo that they might have been exchanged. As explained in section 1.4
the space of all loops up to continuous deformations equipped with loop
composition is the fundamental group @xmath .

The abelianization of the fundamental group is the first homology group
@xmath , and its structure plays an important role in the
characterization of quantum statistics. In order to clarify this idea we
will first consider the well-known problem of quantum statistics of many
particles in @xmath , @xmath . We will describe fully both the
fundamental and homology groups of @xmath for @xmath , showing that for
@xmath , the only possible statistics are bosonic and fermionic, while
for @xmath anyon statistics emerges.

#### 1.8.1 Quantum statistics for @xmath

##### The case @xmath and @xmath.

When @xmath and @xmath the fundamental group @xmath is trivial, since
there are enough degrees of freedom to avoid coincident configurations
during the continuous contraction of any loop. Let us recall that we
have a natural action of the permutation group @xmath on @xmath which is
free ³ ³ 3 The action of a group @xmath on @xmath is free iff the
stabilizer of any @xmath is the neutral element of @xmath . . In such a
situation the following theorem holds [ 25 ] .

###### Theorem 1.8.1.

If an action of a finite group @xmath on a space @xmath is free then
@xmath is isomorphic to @xmath , where @xmath is the natural projection
and @xmath is the induced map of fundamental groups.

Notice that in particular if @xmath is trivial we get @xmath . In our
setting @xmath and @xmath . The triviality of @xmath implies that the
fundamental group of @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.8.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The homology group @xmath is the abelianization of @xmath . Hence,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.8.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Notice that @xmath might also be represented as @xmath . This result can
explain why we have only bosons and fermions in @xmath when @xmath (see,
e.g. [ 17 ] for a detailed discussion).

##### The case @xmath.

The case of @xmath is different as @xmath is no longer trivial and it is
hard to use Theorem 1 directly. In fact it can be shown (see [ 22 ] )
that for @xmath the fundamental group @xmath is an Artin braid group
@xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.8.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where in the first group of relations we take @xmath , and in the
second, we take @xmath Although this group has a complicated structure,
it is easy to see that its abelianization is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.8.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This simple fact gives rise to a phenomena called anyon statistics [ 36
, 46 ] , i.e., particles in @xmath are no longer fermions or bosons but
instead any phase @xmath can be gained when they are exchanged [ 17 ] .

### 1.9 Graph configuration spaces

Here we consider the main problem of this thesis, namely @xmath is a
graph. We describe the combinatorial structure of @xmath .

Let @xmath be a metric ⁴ ⁴ 4 A graph is metric if its edges have assign
lengths. connected simple graph on @xmath vertices and @xmath edges.
Similarly to the previous cases we define

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.9.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.9.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the permutation group of @xmath elements. Notice also
that the group @xmath acts freely on @xmath , which means that @xmath is
the covering space of @xmath . It seems a priori a difficult task to
compute @xmath . Fortunately, this problem can be reduced to the
computation of the first homology group of a cell complex, which we
define now.

Following [ 24 ] we define the @xmath -particle combinatorial
configuration space as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.9.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath denotes all cells whose closure intersects with @xmath .
The space @xmath possesses a natural cell - complex structure with
vertices as @xmath -cells, edges as @xmath -cells, @xmath -cells
corresponding to moving two particles along two disjoint edges in @xmath
, and @xmath - cells defined analogously. The existence of a cell -
complex structure happens to be very helpful for investigating the
homotopy structure of the underlying space. Namely, we have the
following theorem:

###### Theorem 1.9.1.

[ 1 , 41 ] (Abrams) For any graph @xmath with at least @xmath vertices,
the inclusion @xmath is a homotopy equivalence iff the following hold:

1.   Each path between distinct vertices of valence not equal to two
    passes through at least @xmath edges.

2.   Each closed path in @xmath passes through at least @xmath edges.

For @xmath these conditions are automatically satisfied (provided @xmath
is simple). Intuitively, they can be understood as follows:

1.  In order to have homotopy equivalence between @xmath and @xmath , we
    need to be able to accommodate @xmath particles on every edge of
    graph @xmath .

2.  For every cycle there is at least one free (not occupied) vertex
    which enables the exchange of particles along this cycle.

Using Theorem 1.9.1 , the problem of finding @xmath is reduced to the
problem of computing @xmath . In the following two chapters of the
thesis we will discuss how to determine @xmath . Meanwhile, to clarify
the idea behind theorem 1.9.1 let us consider the following example.

###### Example 1.9.2.

Let @xmath be a star graph on four vertices (see figure 1.10 (a)). The
two-particle configuration spaces @xmath and @xmath are shown in figures
1.10 (b),(c). Notice that @xmath consists of six @xmath - cells (three
are interiors of triangles and the other three are interiors of
squares), eleven @xmath - cells and six @xmath - cells. Vertices @xmath
, @xmath , @xmath and @xmath do not belong to @xmath . Similarly dashed
edges, i.e. @xmath , @xmath , @xmath do not belong to @xmath . This is
why @xmath is not a cell complex - not every cell has its boundary in
@xmath . Notice that cells of @xmath whose closures intersect @xmath
(denoted by dashed lines and diamond points) do not influence the
homotopy type of @xmath (see figures 1.10 (b),(c)). Hence, the space
@xmath has the same homotopy type as @xmath , but consists of six @xmath
- cells and six @xmath - cells. @xmath is subspace of @xmath denoted by
dotted lines in figure 1.10 (b). In particular, one can also easily
calculate that @xmath .

### 1.10 Quantum graphs

The main attraction of quantum graphs is that they are simple models to
study complicated phenomena. A metric graph @xmath is a graph whose
edges have assigned lengths. One can consider single-particle quantum
mechanics on a metric graph. A particle is described by a collection of
wavefunctions, @xmath , living on the edges of @xmath . On each edge a
Hamiltonian, @xmath , is defined. Typically it is of the form:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.10.1)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In order to ensure selfadjointness of the Hamiltonian, boundary
conditions at the vertices are introduced. For a free particle, i.e when
@xmath an example is Neumann boundary conditions:

1.  Wavefunctions are continous at vertices.

2.  The sum of outgoing derivatives vanishes at each vertex.

The full characterization of boundary conditions for a free particle on
a quantum graph was given in [ 31 ] and is expressed in terms of
Lagrangian planes of a certain complex symplectic form. Quantum
mechanics of a single particle on a quantum graph is rather well
understood. It has bee been recently extensively investigated from
various angeles, e.g. superconductivity [ 23 ] quantum chaos [ 32 ] or
Anderson localization [ 3 ] .

For understanding quantum statistics on a metric graph @xmath , which is
a topological property of the underlying configuration space @xmath , it
is irrelevant to know the lengths of the edges of @xmath . That is why
in the following we will always treat @xmath as a @xmath -dimensional
cell complex. Using the fact that spaces @xmath and @xmath are homotopic
and by definition of the first homology group we need to only study the
@xmath -skeleton of @xmath . In order to provide some physical intuition
we will now describe the following model.

#### 1.10.1 Topological gauge potential

Assume that @xmath is, as explained in section 1.9 , sufficiently
subdivided. Note that @xmath -skeleton of @xmath consists of unordered
collections of @xmath distinct vertices of @xmath , @xmath . The
connections between @xmath -cells are described by @xmath -cells of
@xmath . Two @xmath -cells are connected by an edge iff they have @xmath
vertices in common and the remaining two vertices are connected by an
edge in @xmath . In other words @xmath -cells of @xmath are of the form
@xmath up to permutations, where @xmath are vertices of @xmath and
@xmath is an edge of @xmath whose endpoints are not @xmath . For
simplicity we will use the following notation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

An @xmath -particle gauge potential is a function @xmath defined on the
directed edges of @xmath with the values in @xmath modulo @xmath such
that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.10.2)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In order to define @xmath on linear combinations of directed edges we
extend ( 1.10.2 ) by linearity.

For a given gauge potential, @xmath the sum of its values calculated on
the directed edges of an oriented cycle @xmath will be called the flux
of @xmath through @xmath and denoted @xmath . Two gauge potentials
@xmath and @xmath are called equivalent if for any oriented cycle @xmath
the fluxes @xmath and @xmath are equal modulo @xmath .

The @xmath -particle gauge potential @xmath is called a topological
gauge potential if for any contractible oriented cycle @xmath in @xmath
the flux @xmath . It is thus clear that equivalence classes of
topological gauge potentials are in 1-1 correspondence with the
equivalence classes in @xmath . Therefore, characterization of quantum
statistics is characterization of all possible topological gauge
potentials. These potentials can be incorporated into the Hamiltonian of
a so-called tight-binding model. In short, it is a model whose
underlying Hilbert space is spanned by elements of the @xmath -skeleton
of @xmath and the Hamiltonian is given by the adjacency matrix of the
@xmath -skeleton of @xmath . As @xmath is defined on the edges of @xmath
it can be added to the Hamiltonian by changing: @xmath (see [ 26 ] for
more detailed discussion in case of two particles).

## Chapter 2 Quantum Statistics on graphs

In this chapter we raise the question of what quantum statistics are
possible on quantum graphs. In particular we develop a full
characterization of abelian quantum statistics on graphs. We explain how
the number of anyon phases is related to connectivity. For @xmath
-connected graphs the independence of quantum statistics with respect to
the number of particles is proven. For non-planar @xmath -connected
graphs we identify bosons and fermions as the only possible statistics,
whereas for planar @xmath -connected graphs we show that one anyon phase
exists. Our approach also yields an alternative proof of the structure
theorem for the first homology group of @xmath -particle graph
configuration spaces. Finally, we determine the topological gauge
potentials for @xmath -connected graphs.

In order to explore how the quantum statistics picture depends on
topology, the case of two indistinguishable particles on a graph was
studied in [ 26 ] (see also [ 10 ] ). Recall that a graph @xmath is a
network consisting of vertices (or nodes) connected by edges. Quantum
mechanically, one can either consider the one-dimensional Schrödinger
operator acting on the edges, with matching conditions for the
wavefunctions at the vertices, or a discrete Schrödinger operator acting
on connected vertices (i.e. a tight-binding model on the graph). Such
systems are of considerable independent interest and their
single-particle quantum mechanics has been studied extensively in recent
years [ 11 ] . The extension of this theory to many-particle quantum
graphs was another motivation for [ 26 ] (see also [ 14 ] ). The
discrete case turns out to be significantly easier to analyse, and in
this situation it was found that a rich array of anyon statistics are
kinematically possible. Specifically, certain graphs were found to
support anyons while others can only support fermions or bosons. This
was demonstrated by analysing the topology of the corresponding
configuration graphs @xmath in various examples. It opens up the problem
of determining general relations between the quantum statistics of a
graph and its topology.

As explained in the previous section, mathematically the determination
of quantum statistics reduces to finding the first homology group @xmath
of the appropriate classical configuration space, @xmath . Although the
calculation for @xmath is relatively elementary, it becomes a
non-trivial task when @xmath is replaced by a general graph @xmath . One
possible route is to use discrete Morse theory, as developed by Forman [
18 ] . This is a combinatorial counterpart of classical Morse theory,
which applies to cell complexes. In essence, it reduces the problem of
finding @xmath , where @xmath is a cell complex, to the construction of
certain discrete Morse functions, or equivalently discrete gradient
vector fields. Following this line of reasoning Farley and Sabalka [ 19
] defined the appropriate discrete vector fields and gave a formula for
the first homology groups of tree graphs. Recently, making extensive use
of discrete Morse theory and some graph invariants, Ko and Park [ 30 ]
extended the results of [ 19 ] to an arbitrary graph @xmath . However,
their approach relies on a suite of relatively elaborate techniques –
mostly connected to a proper ordering of vertices and choices of trees
to reduce the number of critical cells – and the relationship to, and
consequences for, the physics of quantum statistics are not easily
identified.

In this chapter we give a full characterization of all possible abelian
quantum statistics on graphs. In order to achieve this we develop a new
set of ideas and methods which lead to an alternative proof of the
structure theorem for the first homology group of the @xmath -particle
configuration space obtained by Ko and Park [ 30 ] . Our reasoning,
which is more elementary in that it makes minimal use of discrete Morse
theory, is based on a set of simple combinatorial relations which stem
from the analysis of some canonical small graphs. The advantage for us
of this approach is that it is explicit and direct. This makes the
essential physical ideas much more transparent and so enables us to
identify the key topological determinants of the quantum statistics. It
also enables us to develop some further physical consequences. In
particular we give a full characterization of the topological gauge
potentials on @xmath -connected graphs, and identify some examples of
particular physical interest, in which the quantum statistics have
features that are subtle.

The chapter is organized as follows. We start with a discussion, in
section 2.1 , of some physically interesting examples of quantum
statistics on graphs, in order to motivate the general theory that
follows. In section 2.2 we define some basic properties of graph
configuration spaces. In section 2.3 we develop a full characterization
of the first homology group for @xmath -particle graph configuration
spaces. In section 2.4 we give a simple argument for the stabilization
of quantum statistics with respect to the number of particles for @xmath
-connected graphs. Using this we obtain the desired result for @xmath
-particle graph configuration spaces when @xmath is @xmath -connected.
In order to generalize the result to @xmath -connected graphs we
consider star and fan graphs. The main result is obtained at the end of
section 2.5 . The first homology group @xmath is given by the direct sum
of a free component, which corresponds to anyon phases and Aharonov-Bohm
phases, and a torsion component, which is restricted to be a direct sum
of copies of @xmath . The last part of the chapter is devoted to the
characterization of topological gauge potentials for @xmath -connected
graphs.

### 2.1 Quantum statistics on graphs

In this section we discuss several examples which illustrate some
interesting and surprising aspects of quantum statistics on graphs. A
determining factor turns out to be the connectivity of a graph. We
recall (cf [ 45 ] ) that a graph is @xmath -connected if it remains
connected after removing any @xmath vertices. (Note that a @xmath
-connected graph is also @xmath -connected for any @xmath .) According
to Menger’s theorem [ 45 ] , a graph is @xmath -connected if and only if
every pair of distinct vertices can be joined by at least @xmath
disjoint paths. A @xmath -connected graph can be decomposed into @xmath
-connected components, unless it is complete [ 27 ] . Thus, a graph may
be regarded as being built out of more highly connected components.
Quantum statistics, as we shall see, depends on @xmath -connectedness up
to @xmath . (Remark: in this thesis, quantum statistics refers
specifically to phases involving cycles of two or more particles; phases
associated with single-particle cycles, called Aharonov-Bohm phases, are
introduced in Section 2.4 below).

#### 2.1.1 @xmath-connected graphs

Quantum statistics for any number of particles on a @xmath -connected
graph depends only on whether the graph is planar, and not on any
additional structure. We recall that a graph is planar if it can be
drawn in the plane without crossings. For planar @xmath -connected
graphs we will show that the statistics is characterised by a single
anyon phase associated with cycles in which a pair of particles exchange
positions. For non-planar @xmath -connected graphs, the statistics is
either Bose or Fermi – in effect, the anyon phase is restricted to be
@xmath and @xmath . Thus, as far as quantum statistics is concerned,
three- and higher-connected graphs behave like @xmath in the planar case
and @xmath , @xmath , in the nonplanar case. A new aspect for graphs is
the possibility of combining planar and nonplanar components. The graph
shown in figure 2.1 consists of a large square lattice in which four
cells have been replaced by a defect in the form of a @xmath subgraph,
the (nonplanar) fully connected graph on five vertices. This local
substitution makes the full graph nonplanar, thereby excluding anyon
statistics.

One of the simplest examples of this phenomenon is provided by the graph
@xmath shown in figure 2.2 . @xmath is planar @xmath -connected, and
therefore supports an anyon phase. However, if an additional edge @xmath
is added, the resulting graph is @xmath , and therefore supports only
Bose or Fermi statistics. One can continuously interpolate from a
quantum Hamiltonian defined on @xmath to one defined by @xmath by
introducing an amplitude coefficient @xmath for transitions along @xmath
. For @xmath , the edge @xmath is effectively absent, and the resulting
Hamiltonian is defined on @xmath . This situation might appear to be
paradoxical; how could anyon statistics, well defined for @xmath ,
suddenly disappear for @xmath ? The resolution lies in the fact that an
anyon phase defined for @xmath introduces, for @xmath , physical effects
that cannot be attributed to quantum statistics (unless the phase is
@xmath or @xmath ). The transition between planar and nonplanar
geometries, which is easily effected with quantum graphs, merits further
study.

#### 2.1.2 @xmath-connected graphs

Quantum statistics on @xmath -connected graphs is more complex, and
depends on the decomposition of individual graphs into cycles and @xmath
-connected components (see Section 2.3.3 ). There may be multiple anyon
and @xmath (or Bose/Fermi alternative) phases. But @xmath -connected
graphs share the following important property: their quantum statistics
do not depend on the number of particles, and therefore can be regarded
as a characteristic of the particle species. This property is important
physically; it means that there is a building-up principle for
increasing the number of particles in the system. This is described in
detail in Section 2.6 , where we show how to construct an @xmath
-particle Hamiltonian from a two-particle Hamiltonian. Interesting
examples are also obtained by building @xmath -connected graphs out of
higher-connected components. Figure 2.3 shows a chain of identical
non-planar 3-connected components. The links between components,
represented by lines in figure 2.3 , consist of at least two edges, so
that resulting graph is @xmath -connected. In this case, the quantum
statistics is in fact independent of the number of particles, and may be
determined by specifying exchange phases ( @xmath or @xmath ) for each
component in the chain. Thus, particles can act as bosons or fermions in
different parts of the graph.

#### 2.1.3 @xmath-connected graphs

Quantum statistics on graphs achieves its full complexity for
1-connected graphs, in which case it also depends on the number of
particles @xmath . A representative example, treated in detail in
Section 2.5.1 , is a star graph with @xmath edges, for which the number
of anyon phases is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and therefore depends on both @xmath and @xmath .

#### 2.1.4 Aharonov-Bohm phases

Configuration-space cycles on which one particle moves around a circuit
@xmath while the others remain stationary play an important role in the
analysis of quantum statistics which follows. We call these
Aharonov-Bohm cycles, and the corresponding phases Aharonov-Bohm phases,
because they correspond physically to magnetic fluxes threading @xmath .
In many-body systems, Aharonov-Bohm phases and quantum statistics phases
can interact in interesting ways. In particular, Aharonov-Bohm phases
can depend on the positions of the stationary particles. An example is
shown in the two-particle octahedron graph (see figure 2.4 ), in which
the Aharonov-Bohm phase associated with one particle going around the
equator depends on whether the second particle is at the north or south
pole. For @xmath -connected non-planar graphs, it can be shown that
Aharonov-Bohm phases are independent of the positions of the stationery
particles. (The octahedron graph, despite appearances, is planar.)

### 2.2 Graph configuration spaces

In this section we repeat some definitions and theorems proved in the
introduction. They will play a basic role in the current chapter. Let
@xmath be a metric connected simple graph with @xmath vertices and
@xmath edges. In a metric graph edges correspond to finite closed
intervals of @xmath . However, as we will be interested in the topology
of the graph, the length of the edges will not play a role in the
discussion. As explained in the introduction an undirected edge between
vertices @xmath and @xmath will be denoted by @xmath . It will also be
convenient to be able to label directed edges, so @xmath and @xmath will
denote the directed edges associated with @xmath . A path joining two
vertices @xmath and @xmath is then specified by a sequence of @xmath
directed edges, written @xmath .

We define the @xmath -particle configuration space as the quotient space

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the permutation group of @xmath elements and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is the set of coincident configurations. We are interested in the
calculation of the first homology group, @xmath of @xmath . The space
@xmath is not a cell complex. However, it is homotopy equivalent to the
space @xmath , which is a cell complex, defined below.

Recall that a cell complex @xmath is a nested sequence of topological
spaces

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the @xmath ’s are the so-called @xmath -skeletons defined as
follows:

-   The @xmath - skeleton @xmath is a finite set of points.

-   For @xmath , the @xmath - skeleton @xmath is the result of attaching
    @xmath - dimensional balls @xmath to @xmath by gluing maps

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (2.2.4)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    where @xmath is the unit-sphere @xmath .

A @xmath -cell is the interior of the ball @xmath attached to the @xmath
-skeleton @xmath .

Every simple graph @xmath is naturally a cell complex; the vertices are
@xmath -cells (points) and edges are @xmath -cells ( @xmath -dimensional
balls whose boundaries are the @xmath -cells). The product @xmath then
naturally inherits a cell complex structure. The cells of @xmath are
Cartesian products of cells of @xmath . It is clear that the space
@xmath is not a cell complex as points belonging to @xmath have been
deleted. Following [ 1 ] we define an @xmath -particle combinatorial
configuration space as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath denotes all cells whose closure intersects with @xmath .
The space @xmath possesses a natural cell complex structure. Moreover,

###### Theorem 2.2.1.

[ 1 ] For any graph @xmath with at least @xmath vertices, the inclusion
@xmath is a homotopy equivalence iff the following hold:

1.   Each path between distinct vertices of valence not equal to two
    passes through at least @xmath edges.

2.   Each closed path in @xmath passes through at least @xmath edges.

Following [ 1 , 19 ] we refer to a graph @xmath with properties 1 and 2
as sufficiently subdivided . For @xmath these conditions are
automatically satisfied (provided @xmath is simple). Intuitively, they
can be understood as follows:

1.  In order to have homotopy equivalence between @xmath and @xmath , we
    need to be able to accommodate @xmath particles on every edge of
    graph @xmath . This is done by introducing @xmath trivial vertices
    of degree @xmath to make a line subgraph between every adjacent pair
    of non-trivial vertices in the original graph @xmath .

2.  For every cycle there is at least one free (not occupied) vertex
    which enables the exchange of particles around this cycle.

For a sufficiently subdivided graph @xmath we can now effectively treat
@xmath as a combinatorial graph where particles are accommodated at
vertices and hop between adjacent unoccupied vertices along edges of
@xmath . See Figure 2.6 for a comparison of the configuration spaces
@xmath and @xmath of a Y-graph.

Using Theorem 2.2.1 , the problem of finding @xmath is reduced to the
problem of computing @xmath . In the next sections we show how to
determine @xmath for an arbitrary simple graph @xmath . Note, however,
that by the structure theorem for finitely generated modules [ 38 ]

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the torsion, i.e.

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and @xmath . In other words @xmath is determined by @xmath free
parameters @xmath and @xmath discrete parameters @xmath such that for
each @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Taking into account their physical interpretation we will call the
parameters @xmath and @xmath continuous and discrete phases
respectively.

### 2.3 Two-particle quantum statistics

In this section we fully describe the first homology group @xmath for an
arbitrary connected simple graph @xmath . We start with three simple
examples: a cycle, a Y-graph and a lasso. The @xmath -particle discrete
configuration space of the lasso reveals an important relation between
the exchange phase on the Y-graph and on the cycle. Combining this
relation with an ansatz for a perhaps over-complete spanning set of the
cycle space of @xmath and some combinatorial properties of @xmath
-connected graphs, we give a formula for @xmath . Our argument is
divided into three parts; corresponding to @xmath -, @xmath - and @xmath
-connected graphs respectively.

##### Three examples

-   Let @xmath be a triangle graph shown in figure 2.5 (a). Its
    combinatorial configuration space @xmath is shown in figure 1(b).
    The cycle @xmath is not contractible and hence @xmath . In other
    words we have one free phase @xmath and no torsion.

-   Let @xmath be a Y-graph shown in figure 2.6 (a). Its combinatorial
    configuration space @xmath is shown in figure 2.6 (b). The cycle
    @xmath is not contractible and @xmath . Hence we have one free phase
    @xmath and no torsion. For comparison the configuration space @xmath
    is shown in figure 2.6 (c). Contracting the triangular planes onto
    the hexagon and then contracting the surface of the hexagon to the
    boundary (expanding the empty vertex in the center) one obtains the
    combinatorial configuration space shown in figure 2.6 (b).

-   Let @xmath be a lasso graph shown in figure 2.7 (a). It is a
    combination of Y and triangle graphs. Its combinatorial
    configuration space @xmath is shown in figure 3(b). The shaded
    rectangle is a @xmath -cell and hence the cycle @xmath is
    contractible. The cycle @xmath corresponds to the situation when one
    particle is sitting at the vertex @xmath and the other moves along
    the cycle @xmath of @xmath . We will call this cycle an
    Aharonov-Bohm cycle (AB-cycle) and denote its phase @xmath (the
    subscript @xmath indicates that @xmath is traversed by just 1
    particle, and the superscript @xmath indicates the position of the
    stationary particle). The cycle @xmath represents the exchange of
    two particles around @xmath . The corresponding phase will be
    denoted by @xmath . Finally, for the cycle @xmath , corresponding to
    exchange of two particles along a Y-graph, the phase is denoted
    @xmath . There is no torsion in @xmath . Moreover,

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (2.3.1)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    Thus, the Y-phase @xmath and the AB-phase @xmath determine @xmath .

###### Remark 2.3.1.

Any relation between cycles on a graph @xmath holds between the
corresponding cycles on a graph @xmath containing @xmath as a subgraph
or a subgraph homotopic to @xmath . It is for this reason that ( 2.3.1 )
will play a key role in relating Y-phases and AB-phases for general
graphs.

#### 2.3.1 A spanning set of @xmath

In order to proceed with the calculation of @xmath for arbitrary @xmath
we need a spanning set of @xmath . Before we give one, let us discuss
the dependence of the AB-phase on the position of the second particle.
Suppose there is a cycle @xmath in @xmath with two vertices @xmath and
@xmath not on the cycle. We want to know the relation between @xmath and
@xmath . There are two possibilities to consider. The first is shown in
figure 2.8 (a) and represents the situation when there is a path @xmath
which joins @xmath and @xmath and is disjoint with @xmath . In this case
both AB-cycles are homotopy equivalent as they belong to the cylinder
@xmath . Therefore,

###### Fact 1.

Assume there is a cycle @xmath in @xmath with two vertices @xmath and
@xmath not on the cycle. Suppose there is a path @xmath which joins
@xmath and @xmath and is disjoint with @xmath . Then @xmath .

Assume now that every path joining @xmath and @xmath passes through the
cycle @xmath (see figure 2.8 (b)). Noting that the graph contains two
subgraphs homotopic to the lasso which in turn both contain @xmath , and
making use of Remark 2.3.1 , we can repeat the argument leading to
relation ( 2.3.1 ) for each lasso. We obtain,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and hence

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Thus, for a fixed one-particle cycle @xmath in @xmath , the difference
between any two AB-phases (corresponding to two different positions of
the stationary particle) may be expressed in terms of the Y-phases.

As we show in section 2.7 , a spanning set of @xmath is given by all Y
and AB-cycles. Note that from relations ( 2.3.1 ) and ( 2.3.3 ) , we can
restrict the set of AB-cycles to belong to a basis for @xmath (since all
other AB-cycles can be expressed in terms of these and Y-cycles). By
Euler’s formula, the dimension of @xmath is given by the first Betti
number,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

As a result, we will use a spanning set (which in general is
over-complete) containing the following:

1.  All @xmath -particle cycles corresponding to the exchanges on Y
    subgraphs of @xmath . There may be relations between these cycles.

2.  A set of @xmath AB-cycles, one for each independent cycle in a basis
    for @xmath .

Thus, @xmath , where @xmath is determined by Y-cycles. Consequently, in
order to determine @xmath one has to study the relations between
Y-cycles.

#### 2.3.2 @xmath-connected graphs

In this section we determine @xmath for @xmath -connected graphs. Let
@xmath be a connected graph. We define an @xmath -separation of @xmath [
45 ] , where @xmath is a positive integer, as an ordered pair @xmath of
subgraphs of @xmath such that

1.  The union @xmath .

2.  @xmath and @xmath are edge-disjoint and have exactly @xmath common
    vertices, @xmath .

3.  @xmath and @xmath have each a vertex not belonging to the other.

It is customary to say that the @xmath separates vertices of @xmath and
@xmath different from @xmath .

###### Definition 2.3.2.

A connected graph @xmath is @xmath -connected iff it has no @xmath
-separation for any @xmath .

The following theorem of Menger [ 45 ] gives an additional insight into
graph connectivity:

###### Theorem 2.3.3.

For an @xmath -connected graph @xmath there are at least @xmath
internally disjoint paths between any pair of vertices.

The basic example of @xmath -connected graphs are wheel graphs. A wheel
graph @xmath of order @xmath consists of a cycle with @xmath vertices
and a single additional vertex which is connected to each vertex of the
cycle by an edge. Following Tutte [ 45 ] we denote the middle vertex by
@xmath and call it the hub, and the cycle that does not include @xmath
by @xmath and call it the rim. The edges connecting the hub to the rim
will be called spokes. The importance of wheels in the theory of @xmath
-connected graphs follows from the following theorem:

###### Theorem 2.3.4.

(Wheel theorem [ 45 ] ) Let @xmath be a simple @xmath -connected graph
different from a wheel. Then for some edge @xmath , either @xmath or
@xmath is simple and @xmath -connected.

Here @xmath is constructed from @xmath by removing the edge @xmath , and
@xmath is obtained by contracting edge @xmath and identifying its
vertices. These two operations will be called edge removal and edge
contraction. The inverses will be called edge addition and vertex
expansion. Note that vertex expansion requires specifying which edges
are connected to which vertices after expansion. As we deal with @xmath
-connected graphs we will apply the vertex expansion only to vertices of
degree at least four and split the edges between new vertices in a such
way that they are at least @xmath -valent.

As a direct corollary of Theorem 2.3.4 any simple @xmath -connected
graph can be constructed in a finite number of steps starting from a
wheel graph @xmath , for some @xmath ; that is, there exists a sequence
of simple @xmath -connected graphs

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is constructed from @xmath by either

1.  adding an edge between non-adjacent vertices, or

2.  expanding at a vertex of valency at least four.

Therefore, in order to prove inductively some property of a @xmath
-connected graph, it is enough to show that the property holds for an
arbitrary wheel graph and that it persists under operations 1. and
2. above.

###### Lemma 2.3.5.

For wheel graphs @xmath all phases @xmath are equal up to a sign.

###### Proof.

The Y subgraphs of @xmath can be divided into two groups: (i) the center
vertex of Y is on the rim, and (ii) the center vertex of Y is the hub.
For (i) let @xmath and @xmath be two adjacent vertices belonging to the
rim, @xmath . Let @xmath and @xmath be the corresponding Y-graphs whose
central vertices are @xmath and @xmath respectively. Evidently, the two
edges of @xmath and @xmath which are spokes belong to the same triangle
cycle, @xmath , i.e the cycle with vertices @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
(see figure 2.9 (a)). Moreover, @xmath is connected to @xmath by a path
which is disjoint with . Using Fact 2 , we have that @xmath . From this
and relation ( 2.3.3 ), it follows that @xmath . Repeating this
reasoning we obtain that all @xmath , with @xmath belonging to the rim
are equal (perhaps up to a sign). We are left with the Y-graphs whose
central vertex is the hub. Similarly (see figure 2.9 (b)) we take a
cycle, @xmath , with two edges belonging to the chosen Y. Then there is
always a Y-graph with two edges belonging to @xmath and center on the
rim. Therefore, by Fact 2 and relation ( 2.3.3 ) the phase on a Y
subgraph whose center vertex is the hub is the same as on the Y
subgraphs whose center vertex is on the rim. ∎

###### Lemma 2.3.6.

For @xmath -connected simple graphs all phases @xmath are equal up to a
sign.

###### Proof.

We prove by induction. By Lemma 1 the statement is true for all wheel
graphs.

1. Adding an edge: Assume that @xmath and @xmath are non-adjacent
vertices of the @xmath -connected graph @xmath . Suppose that the
relations on @xmath determine that all its @xmath phases are equal (up
to a sign). These relations remain if we add an edge @xmath between the
vertices @xmath and @xmath . Therefore, on @xmath , the phases @xmath
belonging to @xmath must still be equal.

However, the graph @xmath contains new Y-graphs, whose central vertices
are @xmath or @xmath and one of the edges is @xmath . We need to show
that the phase @xmath on these new Y’s is the same as on the old ones.
Let @xmath be such a Y-graph (see figure 2.10 (a)). Let @xmath and
@xmath be endpoints of @xmath and @xmath . By @xmath -connectedness,
there is a path between @xmath and @xmath which does not contain @xmath
or @xmath . In this way we obtain a cycle @xmath , as shown in figure
2.10 (a). Again by @xmath -connectedness, there is a path @xmath from
@xmath to a vertex @xmath in @xmath which does not contain @xmath and
@xmath . Let @xmath be the Y-graph with @xmath as its center and edges
along @xmath and @xmath , as shown in figure 2.10 (a). Then @xmath
belongs to @xmath . Applying Fact 2 and relation ( 2.3.3 ) (cf. the
proof of Lemma 1) to the cycle @xmath and the two Y-graphs discussed,
the result follows.

2. Vertex expansion: Let @xmath be a @xmath -connected simple graph and
let @xmath be a vertex of degree at least four. Let @xmath be a graph
derived from @xmath by expanding at the vertex @xmath , and assume that
the new vertices, @xmath and @xmath , are at least @xmath -valent. These
assumptions are necessary for @xmath to be @xmath -connected [ 45 ] .
Note that @xmath and @xmath have the same number of independent cycles.
Moreover, by splitting at the vertex @xmath we do not change the
relations between the @xmath phases of @xmath . This is simply because
if the equality of some of the @xmath phases required a cycle passing
through @xmath , one can now use the cycle with one more edge passing
through @xmath and @xmath in @xmath . The graph @xmath contains new
Y-graphs, whose central vertices are @xmath or @xmath and one of the
edges is @xmath . We need to show that the phase @xmath on these new Ys
is the same as on the old ones. Let @xmath be such a graph and let
@xmath and @xmath be endpoints of @xmath and @xmath . By @xmath
-connectedness, there is a path between @xmath and @xmath which does not
contain @xmath or @xmath . In this way we obtain a cycle @xmath , as
shown in figure 2.10 (b). Again by @xmath -connectedness, there is a
path @xmath from @xmath to a vertex @xmath in @xmath which does not
contain @xmath and @xmath . Let @xmath be the Y-graph with @xmath as its
center and edges along @xmath and @xmath , as shown in figure 2.10 (b).
Then @xmath belongs to @xmath . Applying Fact 2 and relation ( 2.3.3 )
to the cycle @xmath and the two Y-graphs discussed, the result follows.

###### Theorem 2.3.7.

For a @xmath -connected simple graph, @xmath , where @xmath for
non-planar graphs and @xmath for planar graphs.

###### Proof.

By Lemmas 1 and 2 we only need to determine the phase @xmath . Using the
construction in [ 26 ] , it can be shown by elementary calculations that
for the graphs @xmath and @xmath , @xmath (shorter calculations using
discrete Morse theory are given in [ 30 ] ). Therefore the phase @xmath
or @xmath . By Kuratowski’s theorem [ 33 ] every non-planar graph
contains a subgraph which is isomorphic to @xmath or @xmath . This
proves the statement for non-planar graphs.

If @xmath is planar, then any phase @xmath can be realised. This can be
demonstrated explicitly by appealing to the well-known anyon gauge
potential for two particles in the plane,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The line integral of the one-form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

around a primitive cycle in which the two particles are exchanged yields
the anyon phase @xmath . If @xmath is drawn in the plane and each edge
of @xmath is assigned the phase given by the line integral of @xmath ,
then the phase associated with exchanging the particles on a @xmath
-subgraph is given by @xmath .

∎

For a given cycle on a 3-connected graph, it follows from Theorem 2.3.7
and relation ( 2.3.3 ) that the difference between AB-phases
(corresponding to different positions of the stationary particle) is
either @xmath or @xmath . If the graph is nonplanar, we have that @xmath
, so that the AB-phases are independent of the position of stationary
particle.

#### 2.3.3 @xmath-connected graphs

In this subsection we discuss @xmath -connected graphs. First, by
considering a simple example we show that in contrast to @xmath
-connected graphs it is possible to have more than one @xmath phase.
Using a decomposition procedure of a @xmath -connected graph into @xmath
-connected graphs and topological cycles we provide the formula for
@xmath .

###### Example 2.3.8.

Let us consider graph @xmath shown in figure 2.11 (a). Since vertices
@xmath and @xmath are @xmath -valent, @xmath is not @xmath -connected.
It is however @xmath -connected. Note that @xmath and that there are six
Y-graphs, with central vertices @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath respectively. Using Fact 2 and relation ( 2.3.3 ) we
verify that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

One can also show that the phases @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are
independent.

(For completeness, we give an explicit argument, showing that each one
of the phases @xmath can be made to be nonzero while the other two are
made to be zero. Following the procedure of [ 26 ] , we can assign an
arbitrary phase @xmath to the edge @xmath of @xmath , and zero phase to
all its other edges. This is because @xmath does not belong to a
contractible square in @xmath (no edge of @xmath disjoint from @xmath
has @xmath as a vertex). Since @xmath uses the edge @xmath in @xmath ,
which belongs to @xmath but not to @xmath or @xmath , the phase @xmath
associated with particle exchange on @xmath is given by @xmath (up to a
sign) while @xmath . A similar argument, based on the fact that the edge
@xmath also does not belong to a contractible square in @xmath , leads
to an assignment of phases with @xmath arbitrary, @xmath . Finally, one
can assign edge phases in @xmath so that @xmath is arbitrary. Adjusting
the phases of the edges @xmath and @xmath so that @xmath (which doesn’t
affect @xmath ), we obtain an assignment of phases with @xmath arbitrary
and @xmath . Thus, @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are linearly independent.)

Therefore we have three independent @xmath phases and four AB-phases,
and so

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Vertices @xmath constitute a @xmath -vertex cut of @xmath , i.e. after
their deletion @xmath splits into three connected components @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath (see figure 2.11 (b)). They are no longer @xmath
-connected. Moreover, for example, the two Y-subgraphs @xmath and @xmath
for which @xmath in @xmath no longer satisfy this condition in @xmath ,
i.e. @xmath in @xmath . This is because the AB-phases @xmath and @xmath
are not necessarily equal. (This can be readily seen by constructing the
two-particle configuration space @xmath , an extension of the lasso in
Figure 2.7 (b), and recognising that the corresponding AB cycles are
independent.)

To make components @xmath @xmath -connected and at the same time keep
the correct relations between the @xmath ’s, it is enough to add to each
component @xmath an additional edge between vertices @xmath and @xmath
(see figure 2.11 (c)). The resulting graphs, which we call the marked
components and denote by @xmath [ 30 ] , are @xmath -connected.
Moreover, the relations between the Y-graphs in each @xmath are the same
as in @xmath . The union of the three marked components has, however,
@xmath independent cycles. On the other hand, by splitting @xmath into
marked components, the Y-cycles @xmath and @xmath have been lost. Since
@xmath we have lost one @xmath phase. Summing up we can write @xmath .

##### 2-vertex cut for an arbitrary @xmath-connected graph @xmath

In figure 2.12 (a) a more general @xmath -vertex cut is shown together
with components @xmath red(note that @xmath consists of an interior
@xmath , the edges connecting @xmath to vertices @xmath and @xmath , and
@xmath and @xmath themselves). It is easy to see that the marked
components @xmath are @xmath -connected and the relations between the
@xmath phases in each @xmath are the same as in @xmath . Let @xmath be
the number of @xmath components into which @xmath splits after removal
of vertices @xmath and @xmath . By Euler’s formula the union @xmath of
@xmath marked components has

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (2.3.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

independent cycles. By splitting @xmath into the marked components we
possibly lose @xmath phases corresponding to the Y-graphs with the
central vertex @xmath or @xmath . However

1.  If three edges of a Y-graph are connected to the same component we
    do not lose @xmath .

2.  If two edges of a Y-graph are connected to the same component, we do
    not lose @xmath . The argument is as follows, referring to Figure
    2.12 (b): Let @xmath denote a Y-graph centered at @xmath with
    vertices @xmath and @xmath in the interior @xmath of the component
    @xmath . Since @xmath is 1-connected, there is a path @xmath in
    @xmath from @xmath to @xmath (short dashes in Figure 2.12 (b)).
    Together with the edges from @xmath to @xmath and @xmath , @xmath
    forms a cycle @xmath in @xmath containing two edges of @xmath . In
    addition, there is a path @xmath in @xmath from @xmath to @xmath .
    Let @xmath denote the last vertex on @xmath which belongs to @xmath
    ( @xmath might coincide with @xmath or @xmath , but need not). Let
    @xmath denote the @xmath -graph centred at @xmath with two edges
    along @xmath and one edge along @xmath . Then @xmath is contained in
    @xmath , and by relation ( 2.3.3 ), @xmath . Therefore, @xmath is
    not lost under splitting.

Hence the @xmath phases we lose correspond to the Y-graphs for which
each edge is connected to a different component. First we want to show
that any two Y-graphs with the central vertex @xmath (or @xmath ) whose
edges are connected to three fixed components have the same phase. It is
enough to show this for Y-graphs which share the same center and two
edges. Let us consider two such Y-graphs (see figure 2.12 (c) – the
dashed edges are common to both Y-graphs; the distinct edges are dotted
and dotted-dashed). Let @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , @xmath be the
endpoints of the two shared edges, and @xmath , @xmath the endpoints of
the two distinct edges. As the @xmath ’s are connected, there are paths
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath in @xmath , @xmath and @xmath respectively.
Therefore, we can apply Fact 2 and relation ( 2.3.3 ) to the cycle
@xmath and the two considered Y-graphs to conclude that their @xmath
phases are the same. Therefore, for each choice of three distinct
components, there is just one @xmath phase. Moreover, for a given choice
of distinct components, the phase for the Y-graph with central vertex
@xmath is the same as for the Y-graph with central vertex @xmath (see
figure 2.12 (d) where the considered Y-graphs are denoted by dashed and
dotted lines). This is once again due to Fact 2 and relation ( 2.3.3 )
applied to the cycle @xmath and the two considered Y-graphs.

Summing up, the number of phases we lose when splitting @xmath into
@xmath marked components, @xmath , is equal to the number of independent
Y-graphs in the star graph with @xmath edges. This can be calculated
(see for example [ 26 ] ) to be @xmath . Hence

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Note that the @xmath in the exponent here is to get rid of the
additional AB-phase stemming from the calculation ( 2.3.7 ). Also, it is
straightforward to see that although introducing an additional edge to a
marked component may give rise to a new @xmath -graph, the associated
@xmath -phase is not new, and is equal to a @xmath -phase of @xmath
-graph inside the component.

Finally, it is known in graph theory that by the repeated application of
the above decomposition procedure the resulting marked components are
either topological cycles or @xmath -connected graphs [ 45 ] . Let
@xmath be the number of @xmath -vertex cuts which is needed to get such
a decomposition, @xmath , @xmath the number of planar @xmath -connected
components, @xmath the number of non-planar @xmath -connected components
and @xmath the number of the topological cycles. Let @xmath . Then

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.10)
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- ----------

Note that @xmath and therefore

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

#### 2.3.4 @xmath-connected graphs

In this subsection we focus on @xmath -connected graphs. Assume that
@xmath is @xmath -connected but not @xmath -connected. There exists a
vertex @xmath such that after its deletion @xmath splits into at least
two connected components. Denote these components by @xmath . It is to
be understood that each component @xmath contains the edges which
connect it to @xmath , along with a copy of the vertex @xmath itself.
Let @xmath denote the number of edges at @xmath which belong to @xmath .
By Euler’s formula the union of components @xmath has

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

independent cycles, hence the number of independent cycles does not
change compared to @xmath . Moreover, the phases @xmath inside each of
the components are the same as in @xmath . Note, however, that by
splitting we lose Y-graphs whose three edges do not belong to one fixed
component @xmath . Consequently, there are two cases to consider:

1.  Two edges of the Y-graph are attached to one component, for example
    @xmath , while the third one is attached to another component,
    @xmath . We claim that the phase @xmath does not depend on the
    choice of the third edge, provided it is attached to @xmath . To see
    this consider two Y-graphs, @xmath and @xmath shown in figure 2.13
    (a). Since vertices @xmath and @xmath are connected by a path, by
    Fact 2 @xmath . Next, relation ( 2.3.3 ) applied to cycle @xmath and
    the two considered Y graphs gives @xmath .

    After choosing one edge of Y in component @xmath (by the above
    argument it does not matter which), we can choose the two other
    edges in @xmath in @xmath ways. Therefore, a priori , we have @xmath
    Y-graphs to consider. There are, however, relations between them. In
    order to find the relevant relations consider the graph shown in
    figure 2.13 (c). We are interested in Y-graphs with one edge given
    by @xmath (dashed line) and two edges joining @xmath to vertices in
    @xmath , say @xmath and @xmath . Each such Y-graph determines a
    cycle @xmath in @xmath containing vertices @xmath , @xmath and
    @xmath (since @xmath is connected). We have that

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (2.3.13)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    Therefore, the @xmath @xmath -phases under consideration are
    determined by the AB- and two-particle phases, @xmath and @xmath ,
    of the associated cycles @xmath . These cycles may be expressed as
    linear combinations of a basis of @xmath cycles, denoted @xmath , as
    in figure 2.13 (c). It is clear that if @xmath , then

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (2.3.14)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    Thus, the @xmath -phases under consideration may be expressed in
    terms of the @xmath phases @xmath and @xmath .

    Let @xmath be the @xmath -graph which determines the cycle @xmath .
    We may turn the preceding argument around; from ( 2.3.13 ), the
    AB-phase @xmath can be expressed in terms of @xmath and @xmath .
    Combining the preceding observations, we deduce that the @xmath
    Y-phases lost when the vertex @xmath is removed may be expressed in
    terms of the phases @xmath and @xmath . The phases @xmath remain
    when @xmath is removed. It follows that phases @xmath suffice to
    determine all of the lost phases, so that the number of independent
    @xmath -phases lost is @xmath . Repeating this argument for each
    component, the total number of Y-phases lost is @xmath , where
    @xmath is the valency of @xmath .

2.  Each edge of the Y-graph is attached to a different component. We
    will show now that once three different components have been chosen
    it does not matter which of the edges attaching @xmath to @xmath we
    choose. It suffices to consider the case where the edges differ for
    only one component. Let us consider the two Y-graphs shown in figure
    2.13 (b). The first one consists of the three dashed edges and the
    second of two dashed edges attached to @xmath and @xmath
    respectively and the dotted edged attached to @xmath . The two
    Y-graphs are shown on their own in figure 2.13 (d); we let @xmath
    and @xmath denote the Y-graphs with vertices @xmath and @xmath
    respectively. A subgraph of the corresponding 2-particle
    configuration space is shown in figure 2.13 (e). There we see that

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (2.3.15)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    In Step 1 above, we showed that the AB phases @xmath and @xmath can
    be expressed in terms of @xmath and Y-phases already accounted for
    in Step 1. Thus, the number of the independent Y-phases we lose is
    equal to the number of independent Y-cycles in the two-particle
    configuration space of the star graph with @xmath edges, that is,
    @xmath .

Summing up we can write

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath . It is known in graph theory [ 45 ] that by the repeated
application of the above decomposition procedure the resulting
components become finally @xmath -connected graphs. Let @xmath be the
set of cut vertices such that components @xmath are @xmath -connected.
Making use of formula ( 2.3.11 ) we can write

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath .

### 2.4 n-particle statistics for @xmath-connected graphs

Having discussed @xmath -particle configuration spaces, we switch to the
@xmath -particle case, @xmath , where @xmath . We proceed in a similar
manner to the previous section. First we give a spanning set of @xmath .
Next we show that if @xmath is @xmath -connected the first homology
group stabilizes with respect to @xmath , that is, @xmath . Making use
of formula ( 2.3.11 )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

#### 2.4.1 A spanning set of @xmath

In order to calculate @xmath we first need to subdivide the edges of
@xmath appropriately. By Theorem 2.2.1 each edge of @xmath must be able
to accommodate @xmath particles and each cycle needs to have at least
@xmath vertices, that is, @xmath needs to be sufficiently subdivided.
Before we specify a spanning set of @xmath we first discuss two
interesting aspects of this space. The first one concerns the relation
between the exchange phase of @xmath particles, @xmath on the cycle
@xmath of the lasso graph and its @xmath phases (see Lemma 2.4.1 ). The
second gives the relation between the AB-phases for fixed cycle @xmath
of @xmath and the different possible positions of the @xmath stationary
particles.

###### Lemma 2.4.1.

The exchange phase, @xmath , of @xmath particles on the cycle @xmath of
the lasso graph is the sum of the exchange phase, @xmath , of @xmath
particles on the cycle @xmath with the last particle sitting at the
vertex not belonging to @xmath , e.g. vertex @xmath , and the phase
@xmath associated with the exchange of two particles on the @xmath
subgraph with @xmath particles placed in the vertices @xmath of @xmath
not belonging to the Y

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

By ( 2.3.1 ), the lemma is true for @xmath . The proof for @xmath
particles is shown in figure 2.15 (a), and contains the essence of the
argument for general @xmath . Indeed, the way to incorporate additional
particles is illustrated by the @xmath case, shown in figure 2.15 (b).
Note that figure 2.15 shows only the small portion of the @xmath and
@xmath configuration spaces required to establish the lemma. These
configuration spaces are derived from the @xmath -particle lasso graphs
shown in figures 2.14 (a) and 2.14 (b) respectively; it is easy to see
that these are indeed sufficiently subdivided. The Y-graphs we consider
for @xmath an @xmath are @xmath and @xmath respectively.

∎

By repeated application of Lemma 2.4.1 we see that @xmath can be
expressed as a sum of an AB-phase and the Y-phases corresponding to
different positions of @xmath particles. For example in the case of the
graphs from figure 2.14 (a) and 2.14 (b) we get

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

##### Aharonov-Bohm phases

Assume now that we have @xmath particles on @xmath . Let @xmath be a
cycle of @xmath and @xmath and @xmath two sufficiently subdivided edges
attached to @xmath (see figure 2.16 (a)). We denote by @xmath the
AB-phase corresponding to the situation where one particle goes around
the cycle @xmath while @xmath particles are in the edge @xmath and
@xmath particles are in the edge @xmath , @xmath . For each distribution
@xmath of the @xmath particles between the edges @xmath and @xmath we
get a (possibly) different AB-cycle and AB-phase in @xmath . We want to
know how they are related. To this end notice that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.4.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and hence

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.4.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The relations between different AB-phases for a fixed cycle @xmath of
@xmath are therefore encoded in the @xmath -particle phases @xmath ,
albeit these phases can depend on the positions of the remaining @xmath
particles.

A spanning set of @xmath is given by the following (see section 2.7 for
proof):

1.  All @xmath -particle cycles corresponding to the exchange of two
    particles on the Y subgraph while @xmath particles are at vertices
    not belonging to the considered Y-graph. In general the phases
    @xmath depend on the position of the remaining @xmath particles.

2.  The set of @xmath AB-cycles, where @xmath is the number of the
    independent cycles of @xmath .

###### Theorem 2.4.2.

For a @xmath -connected graph @xmath the first homology group stabilizes
with respect to the number of particles, i.e. @xmath .

###### Proof.

Using our spanning set it is enough to show that phases on the Y-cycles
do not depend on the position of the remaining @xmath particles. Notice
that if any pair of the vertices not belonging to the chosen Y-graph is
connected by a path then clearly the corresponding Y-phases have this
property. Since the graph @xmath is @xmath -connected it remains at
least @xmath -connected after removal of a vertex. Removing the central
vertex of the Y (see figure 2.16 (b)), the theorem follows. ∎

### 2.5 @xmath-particle statistics on @xmath-connected graphs

By Theorem 2.4.2 , in order to fully characterize the first homology
group of @xmath for an arbitrary graph @xmath we are left to calculate
@xmath for graphs which are 1-connected but not 2-connected. This is
achieved by considering @xmath -particle star and fan graphs.

#### 2.5.1 Star graphs

In the following we consider a particular family of @xmath -connected
graphs, namely the star graphs @xmath with @xmath edges (see figure 2.17
(a)). Our aim is to provide a formula for the dimension of the first
homology group, @xmath , of the @xmath -particle configuration space
@xmath . Let us recall that a graph @xmath is @xmath -connected iff
after deletion of one vertex it splits into at least two connected
components.

##### Star graph with non-subdivided edges

It turns out that the computation of @xmath can be reduced to the case
of @xmath particles on a star graph with non-subdivided edges, so we
consider this case first. Let @xmath denote the star graph with @xmath
vertices and @xmath edges each connecting the central vertex to a single
vertex of valency @xmath ; such a star graph is not sufficiently
subdivided for @xmath particles. As there are no pairs of disjoint edges
(every edge contains the central vertex), there are no contractible
cycles. Therefore, the @xmath -particle configuration space, @xmath is a
graph, i.e. a one-dimensional cell complex. The number of independent
cycles in @xmath , denoted here and in what follows by @xmath , is given
by the first Betti number, @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath are the
number of edges and vertices in @xmath . It is easy to see that @xmath
and @xmath . Hence

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.5.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

##### Y-graph

The simplest case of a sufficiently subdivided star graph is a Y-graph
where each arm has @xmath segments. As there are no cycles on the
Y-graph itself, cycles in the @xmath -particle configuration space are
generated by two-particle exchanges on the non-subdivided subgraph
@xmath comprised of the three segments adjacent to the central vertex. A
basis of independent cycles is obtained by taking all possible
configurations of the @xmath particles amongst the three arms of the
Y-graph. As configurations which differ by shifting particles within the
arms of the Y produce homotopic cycles, the number of distinct
configurations is the number of partitions of @xmath indistinguishable
particles amongst three distinguishable boxes, or @xmath . Therefore,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.5.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

##### Star graph with five arms

For star graphs with more than three arms, it is necessary to take
account of relations between cycles involving two or more moving
particles. With this in mind, we introduce the following terminology: an
@xmath -cycle is a cycle of @xmath particles on which @xmath particles
move and @xmath particles remain fixed.

The general case is well illustrated by considering the star graph with
@xmath arms. As above, we suppose that each arm of @xmath has @xmath
segments, and is therefore sufficiently subdivided to accommodate @xmath
particles. Let @xmath denote the non-subdivided subgraph consisting of
the five segments adjacent to the central vertex. As there are no cycles
on @xmath , a spanning set for the first homology group of the @xmath
-particle configuration space is provided by two-particle cycles on the
Y’s contained in @xmath . The number of independent two-particle cycles
on @xmath is given by @xmath . For each of these, we can distribute the
remaining @xmath particles among the five edges of @xmath (cycles which
differ by shifting particles within an edge are homotopic). Therefore,
we obtain a spanning set consisting of @xmath @xmath -cycles, where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The preceding discussion of non-subdivided star graphs reveals that
there are relations among the cycles in the spanning set. In particular,
a subset of the @xmath -cycles can be replaced by a smaller number of
@xmath -cycles.

To see this, consider first the case of @xmath particles on the
non-subdivided star graph @xmath . By definition, the number of
independent @xmath -cycles is @xmath . However, the number of @xmath
-cycles on @xmath is larger; it is given by @xmath , where the first
factor represents the number of positions of the fixed particle, and the
second factor represents the number of independent @xmath -cycles on the
remaining four edges of @xmath . It is easily checked that @xmath , so
that there are three relations amongst the @xmath -cycles on @xmath .

We return to the case of @xmath particles. For each @xmath -cycle on
@xmath , there are @xmath @xmath -cycles on @xmath ; the factor @xmath
is the number of ways to distribute the @xmath fixed particles on the
five edges of @xmath outside of @xmath . Calculating the number of
@xmath -cycles on @xmath obtained from @xmath -cycles on @xmath requires
a bit more care. The reasoning underlying the preceding count of @xmath
cycles would suggest that the number of such @xmath -cycles is given by
@xmath . However, this expression introduces some double counting. In
particular, @xmath -cycles for which two of the fixed particles lie in
@xmath are counted twice, as each of these two fixed particles is
separately regarded as the fixed particle in a @xmath -cycle on @xmath .
The correct expression is obtained by subtracting the number of doubly
counted cycles; this is given by @xmath . Thus we may replace this
subset of @xmath -cycles by the @xmath -cycles to which they are related
to obtain a smaller spanning set with @xmath elements, where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Finally, we must account for relations among the @xmath -cycles.
Consider first the case of just four particles on @xmath . The number of
independent @xmath -cycles is @xmath . The number of @xmath -cycles is
@xmath , where the first factor represents the number of positions of
the fixed particle, and the second factor represents the number of
independent @xmath -cycles on the remaining four edges of @xmath . For
each @xmath -cycle on @xmath , there are @xmath @xmath cycles on @xmath
. Similarly, for each @xmath -cycle on @xmath , there are @xmath @xmath
-cycles on @xmath (there is no over-counting, as there are no
five-particle cycles on @xmath ). Replacing this subset of @xmath
-cycles by the @xmath -cycles to which they are related, we get a
smaller spanning set of @xmath elements, where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

As there are no five-particle cycles on @xmath , there are no additional
relations, and the resulting spanning set constitutes a basis.

##### @xmath particles on a star graph with @xmath arms

The formula in the general case of @xmath edges is obtained following a
similar argument. We start with a spanning set of @xmath @xmath -cycles
on @xmath . We then replace a subset of @xmath -cycles by a smaller
number of @xmath -cycles, then replace a subset of these @xmath -cycles
by a smaller number of @xmath -cycles, and so on, proceeding to @xmath
-cycles, thereby obtaining a basis. The number of elements in the basis
is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.5.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The outer @xmath -sum is taken over @xmath -cycles. The @xmath th term
is the difference between the number of @xmath -cycles and the number of
@xmath -cycles to which they are related. The inclusion-exclusion sum
over @xmath compensates for over-counting @xmath -cycles with @xmath
fixed particles in @xmath .

It turns out to be convenient to rearrange the sums in ( 2.5.3 ) to
obtain the following equivalent expression:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.5.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.5.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This is because the coefficients @xmath turn out to have a simple
expression. First, straightforward manipulation yields

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.5.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We then have the following:

###### Lemma 2.5.1.

The coefficients @xmath .

###### Proof.

We proceed by induction. Direct calculations give @xmath . Assume that
@xmath for @xmath and @xmath . Using this assumption and ( 2.5.6 )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Making use of the identity @xmath and Vandermonde’s convolution @xmath ,
we get

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Using ( 2.5.1 ) for @xmath , we get

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Expanding @xmath and straightforward manipulations show

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which completes the argument. ∎

By Lemma 2.5.1

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By Vandermonde’s convolution

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Therefore

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Notice that @xmath and thus

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.5.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Note finally that in contrast with @xmath -connected graphs, formula (
2.5.7 ) indicates a strong dependence of the quantum statistics on the
number of particles, @xmath .

#### 2.5.2 The fan graphs

Following the argument presented in section 2.3.4 in order to treat a
one-vertex cut @xmath we need to count the number of the independent
Y-phases which are lost due to the removal of @xmath . As in Section
2.3.4 , let @xmath denote the number of connected components following
the deletion of @xmath , and denote these components by @xmath . For
Y-cycles with edges in three distinct components, the number of
independent phases, @xmath , is given by the expression ( 2.5.7 ) for
star graphs,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.5.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We must also determine the number of independent Y-cycles with two edges
in the same component @xmath , denoted @xmath .

Let us first consider a simple example, namely the graphs shown in
figures 2.18 (a) and 2.18 (b). Assume there are three particles. We
calculate @xmath as follows. The @xmath subgraphs we are interested in
are denoted by dashed lines and are @xmath and @xmath respectively. Note
that each of them contributes three phases corresponding to different
positions of the third particle @xmath . They are, however, not
independent. To see this, note that using Lemma 2.4.1 we can write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The phase @xmath is not lost when @xmath is cut. On the other hand, the
five phases

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.5.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

are lost. The knowledge of them and @xmath determines all six @xmath
phases. Therefore, @xmath is the number of @xmath and @xmath -particle
exchanges on cycle @xmath (which is @xmath ) rather than the number of
@xmath phases (which is @xmath ).

For the general case, let @xmath denote the number of edges at @xmath
which belong to @xmath . Since the @xmath are connected, there exist
@xmath independent cycles in @xmath which connect these edges. Denote
these by @xmath . Fan graphs (see Fig 2.17 (b)) provide the simplest
realization. Using arguments similar to those in the above example, one
can show that Y-cycles with two edges in the same component can be
expressed in terms of two sets of cycles. The first set contains cycles
which are wholly contained in just one of the connected components.
These cycles are not lost when @xmath is cut, and therefore do not
contribute to @xmath . The second type of cycle is characterised as
follows: Consider a partition @xmath of the particles amongst the
components @xmath . For each partition, we can construct cycles where
all of the particles in @xmath – assuming @xmath contains at least one
particle, i.e. that @xmath – are taken to move once around @xmath while
the other particles remain fixed. Excluding the cases in which all of
the particles belong to a single component, the number of such cycles is
given by the following sum over partitions @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Noting that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and @xmath , we readily obtain

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Hence the number of the phases lost when @xmath is cut is given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.5.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

##### The final formula for @xmath

By the repeated application of the one-vertex cuts the resulting
components of @xmath become finally @xmath -connected graphs. Let @xmath
be the set of cut vertices such that components @xmath are @xmath
-connected. Making use of formula ( 2.3.8 ) we write

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.5.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath , the coefficients @xmath are given by ( 2.5.10 ) and
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath are defined as in section 2.3 .

### 2.6 Gauge potentials for @xmath-connected graphs

In this section we give a prescription for the @xmath -particle
topological gauge potential on @xmath in terms of the @xmath -particle
topological gauge potential. For @xmath -connected graphs all choices of
@xmath -particle topological gauge potentials on @xmath are realized by
this prescription. The discussion is divided into three parts: i)
separation of a @xmath -particle topological gauge potential into AB and
quantum statistics components, ii) topological gauge potentials for
2-particles on a subdivided graph, iii) @xmath -particle topological
gauge potentials.

We start with some relevant background. Assume as previously that @xmath
is sufficiently subdivided. Recall that directed edges or @xmath -cells
of @xmath are of the form @xmath up to permutations, where @xmath are
vertices of @xmath and @xmath is an edge of @xmath whose endpoints are
not @xmath . For simplicity we will use the following notation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

An @xmath -particle gauge potential is a function @xmath defined on the
directed edges of @xmath with the values in @xmath modulo @xmath such
that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.6.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In order to define @xmath on linear combinations of directed edges we
extend ( 2.6.1 ) by linearity.

For a given gauge potential, @xmath the sum of its values calculated on
the directed edges of an oriented cycle @xmath will be called the flux
of @xmath through @xmath and denoted @xmath . Two gauge potentials
@xmath and @xmath are called equivalent if for any oriented cycle @xmath
the fluxes @xmath and @xmath are equal modulo @xmath .

The @xmath -particle gauge potential @xmath is called a topological
gauge potential if for any contractible oriented cycle @xmath in @xmath
the flux @xmath . It is thus clear that equivalence classes of
topological gauge potentials are in 1-1 correspondence with the
equivalence classes in @xmath .

##### Pure Aharonov-Bohm and pure quantum statistics topological gauge
potentials

Let @xmath be a graph with @xmath vertices. We say that a 2-particle
gauge potential @xmath is a pure Aharonov-Bohm gauge potential if and
only if

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.6.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Here @xmath can be regarded as a gauge potential on @xmath . Thus, for a
pure AB gauge potential, the phase associated with one particle moving
from @xmath to @xmath does not depend on where the other particle is. We
say that a 2-particle gauge potential @xmath is a pure statistics gauge
potential if and only if

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.6.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

That is, the phase associated with one particle moving from @xmath to
@xmath averaged over all possible positions of the other particle is
zero. It is clear that an arbitrary gauge potential @xmath has a unique
decomposition into a pure AB and pure statistics gauge potentials, i.e.

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.6.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.6.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It is straightforward to verify that if @xmath is a topological gauge
potential, then so are @xmath and @xmath , and vice versa. Moreover, one
can easily check that @xmath vanishes on any Y-cycle of @xmath . Note,
however, that for a given cycle @xmath of @xmath the AB-phase, @xmath
considered in the previous sections is not @xmath but rather @xmath as
AB-phases can depend on the position of the stationary particle.

##### Gauge potential for a subdivided 2-particle graph

Let @xmath be a graph with vertices @xmath . Let @xmath be a gauge
potential on @xmath .

We assume that @xmath is topological, that is, for every pair of
disjoint edges of @xmath , @xmath and @xmath we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.6.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Assume we add a vertex to @xmath by subdividing an edge. Let @xmath and
@xmath denote the vertices of this edge, and denote the new graph by
@xmath and the added vertex by @xmath . Since subdividing an edge does
not change the topology of a graph, it is clear that we can find a gauge
potential, @xmath , on @xmath that is, in some sense, equivalent to
@xmath .

For the sake of completeness, we first give a precise definition of what
it means for gauge potentials on @xmath and @xmath to be equivalent.
Given a path @xmath on @xmath , we can construct a path @xmath on @xmath
by making the replacements

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.6.7)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Similarly, given a path @xmath on @xmath we can construct a path @xmath
on @xmath by making the following substitutions:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.6.8)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

We say that @xmath and @xmath are equivalent if

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.6.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

whenever @xmath and @xmath are related as above.

Next we give an explicit prescription for @xmath . For edges in @xmath
that do not involve vertices on the subdivided edge, we take @xmath to
coincide with @xmath . That is, for @xmath all distinct from @xmath , we
take

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.6.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As @xmath and @xmath are not adjacent on @xmath , we take

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.6.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

For edges on @xmath involving the subdivided segments @xmath and @xmath
, we require that @xmath and @xmath add up to give the phase @xmath on
the original edge. The partitioning of the original phase between the
subdivided segments amounts to a choice of gauge. For definiteness, we
will take the phases on the two halves of the subdivided edge to be the
same, so that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.6.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

It remains to determine @xmath for edges of @xmath on which the
stationary particle sits at the new vertex @xmath . This follows from
requiring that @xmath satisfy the relations

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.6.13)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

From ( 2.6.12 ) and the antisymmetry property @xmath , along with the
relations ( 2.6.6 ) satisfied by @xmath , it follows that these
conditions are equivalent, and both are satisfied by taking

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.6.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Finally, when @xmath or @xmath coincide with one of the vertices @xmath
or @xmath the expression should be

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.6.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

It is then straightforward to verify that @xmath whenever @xmath and
@xmath are related as in ( 2.6 ) and ( 2.6 ) and that @xmath is a
topological gauge potential.

##### Construction of @xmath-particle topological gauge potential

Let @xmath be a gauge potential on @xmath . By repeatedly applying the
procedure from the previous paragraph, we can construct an equivalent
gauge potential @xmath on @xmath , where @xmath is a sufficiently
subdivided version of @xmath , in which @xmath vertices are added to
each edge of @xmath . We resolve @xmath into its AB and statistics
components @xmath and @xmath , as in ( 2.6.4 ). Suppose the pure AB
component is described by the gauge potential @xmath on @xmath . We
define the @xmath -particle gauge potential, @xmath , on @xmath as
follows. Given @xmath vertices of @xmath , denoted @xmath , with @xmath
, we take

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.6.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

That is, the phase associated with the one-particle move @xmath is the
sum of the AB-phase @xmath and the two-particle statistics phases @xmath
summed over the positions of the other particles.

Given that @xmath is a topological gauge potential, let us verify that
@xmath is a topological gauge potential. Let @xmath and @xmath be
distinct edges of @xmath , and let @xmath denote @xmath vertices of
@xmath that are distinct from @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath . We
need to verify if

  -- -------- --
              
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Using ( 2.6.16 ) it reduces to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Next, using the antisymmetry property @xmath and the fact that @xmath is
a topological gauge potential we get

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Therefore, the gauge potential defined by ( 2.6.16 ) is topological.
Equivalence classes of n-particle topological gauge potentials are
essentially elements of the first homology group @xmath . By Theorem
2.4.2 the equivalence classes in @xmath are in 1-1 correspondence with
equivalence classes in @xmath . Hence, for @xmath -connected graphs all
choices of @xmath -particle topological gauge potential on @xmath can be
realized by ( 2.6.16 ). Finally, note that, as explained in [ 26 ] ,
having an @xmath -particle topological gauge potential one can easily
construct a tight-binding Hamiltonian which supports quantum statistics
represented by it (see [ 26 ] for more details).

### 2.7 Morse theory argument

We present an argument which shows the @xmath -particle cycles given in
sections 2.3.1 and 2.4.1 form an over-complete spanning set of the first
homology group @xmath . The argument follows the characterization of the
fundamental group using discrete Morse theory by Farley and Sabalka [ 19
, 21 , 20 ] or alternatively the characterization of the discrete Morse
function for the @xmath -particle graph [ 43 ] . Here, however, we
present the central idea in a way that does not assume a familiarity
with discrete Morse theory in order to remain accessible. For a rigorous
proof we refer to the articles cited above.

Given a sufficiently subdivided graph @xmath we identify some maximal
spanning subtree @xmath in @xmath ; @xmath is obtained by omitting
exactly @xmath of the edges in @xmath such that @xmath remains connected
but contains no loops. The tree can then be drawn in the plane to fix an
orientation. A single vertex of degree @xmath in @xmath is identified as
the root and the vertices of @xmath are labeled @xmath starting with
@xmath for the root and labeling each vertex in turn traveling from the
root around the boundary of @xmath clockwise, see figure 2.19 .

To characterize a spanning set of @xmath -particle cycles for the first
homology group we fix a root configuration @xmath where the particles
are lined up as close to the root as possible, see figure 2.20 (a). The
tree @xmath is used to establish a set of contractable paths between
@xmath -particle configurations on the graph (a discrete vector field).
Given an @xmath -particle configuration @xmath on the graph a path from
@xmath to @xmath is a sequence of one-particle moves, where a single
particle hops to an adjacent vacant vertex with the remaining @xmath
particles remaining fixed. This is a @xmath -cell @xmath where @xmath
and @xmath are the locations of the moving particle. The labeling of the
vertices in the tree provides a discrete vector field on the
configuration space. A particle moves according to the vector field if
@xmath , i.e. the particle moves towards the root along the tree. This
allows a particle to move through a non-trivial vertex (a vertex of
degree @xmath ) if the particle is coming from the direction clockwise
from the direction of the root. To define a flow that takes any
configuration back to @xmath we also define a set of priorities at the
non-trivial vertices that avoids @xmath -particle paths crossing. A
particle may also move onto a non-trivial vertex @xmath according to the
vector field if the @xmath -cell @xmath does not contain a vertex @xmath
with @xmath ; i.e. moving into a nontrivial vertex particles give way
(yield) to the right. So a particle can only move into the nontrivial
vertex if there are no particles on branches of the graph between the
branch the particle is on and the root direction clockwise from the
root. With this set of priorities it is clear that a path (sequence of
@xmath -cells) exists that takes any configuration @xmath to @xmath
using only @xmath -cells in the discrete vector field. Equivalently by
reversing the direction of edges in @xmath -cells we can move particles
from the reference configuration @xmath to any configuration @xmath
against the flow. As @xmath -particle paths following this discrete flow
do not cross these paths are contractible; equivalently, the phase
around closed loops combining paths following and against the discrete
flow is zero. Note, we will describe paths either in the direction of
the flow or against it as according to the vector field.

It remains to find a spanning set for the cycles that use @xmath -cells
not in the discrete vector field (that is, cells that are neither in the
direction of the flow or against it). We see now that there are only two
types of @xmath -cells that are excluded; those where the edge @xmath is
one of the @xmath edges omitted from @xmath to construct @xmath , and
those where a particle moves through a non-trivial vertex out of order -
without giving way to the right.

We first consider a @xmath -cell @xmath where @xmath is an omitted edge.
Such a @xmath -cell is naturally associated with a cycle where the
particles move from @xmath to @xmath against the flow, then follow
@xmath and finally move back from @xmath to @xmath following the flow.
These @xmath -particle cycles are typically the AB-cycles where one
particle moves around a loop in @xmath with the other particles at a
given configuration. We saw in section 2.3.1 that while the phase
associated with an AB-cycle can depend on the position of the other
particles, these phases can be parameterized by only @xmath independent
parameters; one parameter for those cycles using each omitted edge.

We now consider, instead, cycles that include a @xmath -cell @xmath
where a particle moves out of order at a nontrivial vertex. Again each
such @xmath -cell is naturally associated to a cycle @xmath through
@xmath where the particle moves according to the vector field except
when it uses the @xmath -cell @xmath . Such a cycle is shown in figure
2.20 .

Such a cycle can be broken down into a product of @xmath -cycles in
which pairs of particles are exchanged using three arms of the tree
connected to the nontrivial vertex @xmath identified by @xmath and some
@xmath where @xmath is a vertex in @xmath with @xmath . Figure 2.21
shows a cycle homotopic to the cycle in figure 2.20 broken into the
product of two @xmath -cycles; paths (a) through (c) and (d) through (e)
respectively. Notice that moving according to the vector field one
returns from the initial configuration in figure 2.21 (a) to the root
configuration in figure 2.20 (a) and similarly one returns from the
final configuration in figure 2.21 (e) to the final configuration figure
2.21 (d). Then by contracting adjacent @xmath -cells in the paths where
the direction of the edge has been reversed it is straightforward to
verify that the cycles in figures 2.20 and 2.21 are indeed homotopic.

Given a cycle @xmath from @xmath associated with a @xmath -cell @xmath
that does not respect the ordering at a nontrivial vertex to obtain a
factorization of @xmath as a product of @xmath -cycles one need only
start from @xmath and follow @xmath until it is necessary to move a
third particle. Instead of moving the third particle close the path to
make a @xmath -cycle, which requires moving only one of the two
particles moved so far. Then retrace ones steps to rejoin @xmath and
move the third particle through the nontrivial vertex again close a
@xmath -cycle and repeat. As any permutation can be written as the
product of exchanges any such cycle @xmath can be factored as a product
of @xmath -cycles.

Finally, as any @xmath -particle cycle can be written as a closed
sequence of @xmath -cells and between @xmath -cells we can add
contractable paths according to the vector field without changing the
phase associated with a cycle, we see that the AB-cycles and the cycles
associated with @xmath subgraphs centered at the nontrivial vertices
form a spanning set for the @xmath -particle cycles. Clearly this
spanning set will, in general, be over-complete as many relations
between these cycles exist in a typical graph, in fact the full discrete
Morse theory argument shows that all such relations are determined by
critical @xmath -cells [ 19 ] .

## Chapter 3 Discrete Morse functions for graph configuration spaces

### 3.1 Introduction

In the last section of chapter 2 some ideas of discrete Morse theory has
been already introduced. In this chapter we present an alternative
application of discrete Morse theory for two-particle graph
configuration spaces. In contrast to previous constructions, which are
based on discrete Morse vector fields, our approach is through Morse
functions, which have a nice physical interpretation as two-body
potentials constructed from one-body potentials. We also give a brief
introduction to discrete Morse theory.

Recently there has been significant progress in understanding
topological properties of configuration spaces of many particles on
metric graphs [ 21 , 30 ] . This was enabled by the foundational
development of discrete Morse theory by Forman during the late 1990’s [
18 ] . This theory reduces the calculation of homology groups to an
essentially combinatorial problem, namely the construction of certain
discrete Morse functions, or equivalently discrete gradient vector
fields. Using this idea Farley and Sabalka [ 21 ] gave a recipe for the
construction of such a discrete gradient vector field [ 21 ] on
many-particle graphs and classified the first homology groups for tree
graphs. In 2011 Ko and Park [ 30 ] significantly extended these results
to arbitrary graphs by incorporating graph-theoretic theorems concerning
the decomposition of a graph into its two and three-connected
components.

In this chapter we give an alternative application of discrete Morse
theory for two-particle graph configuration spaces. In contrast to the
construction given in [ 21 ] , which is based on discrete Morse vector
fields, our approach is through discrete Morse functions. Our main goal
is to provide an intuitive way of constructing a discrete Morse function
and hence a discrete Morse gradient vector field. The central object of
the construction is the ‘trial Morse’ function. It may be understood as
two-body potential constructed from one-body potential, a perspective
which is perhaps more natural and intuitive from a physics point of
view. Having a perfect Morse function ¹ ¹ 1 For the definition of a
perfect Morse function see section 3.2.1 . @xmath on a graph @xmath we
treat it as a one-body potential. The value of the trial Morse function
at each point of a two-particle configuration space is the sum of the
values of @xmath corresponding to the two particles positions in @xmath
. The trial Morse function is typically not a Morse function, i.e. it
might not satisfy some of the relevant conditions. Nevertheless, we find
that it is always possible to modify it and obtain a proper Morse
function out of it. In fact, the trial Morse function is not ‘far’ from
being a Morse function and the number of cells at which it needs fixing
is relatively small. Remarkably, this simple idea leads to similar
results as those obtained in [ 21 ] . We demonstrate it in Section 3.4
by calculating two simple examples. We find that in both cases the trial
Morse function has small defects which can be easily removed and a
proper Morse function is obtained. The corresponding discrete Morse
vector field is equivalent to the one stemming from the Farley and
Sabalka method [ 21 ] . As is shown in Section 3.6 , it is always
possible to get rid of defects of the trial Morse function. The argument
is rather technical. However, since the problem is of a certain
combinatorial complexity we believe it cannot be easily simplified. We
describe in details how the final result, i.e set of discrete Morse
functions along with rules for identifying the critical cells and
constructing the boundary map of the associated Morse complex, is built
in stages from this simple idea. Our main purpose is hence to present an
approach which we believe is conceptually simple and physically natural.
It would be interesting to check if the presented constructions can give
any simplification in understanding the results of [ 30 ] but we do not
pursue this here.

The chapter is organized as follows. In section 3.2 we give a brief
introduction to discrete Morse theory. Then in sections 3.3 and 3.4 ,
for two examples we present a definition of a ‘trial’ Morse function
@xmath for two-particle graph configuration space. We notice that the
trial Morse function typically does not satisfy the conditions required
of a Morse function according to Forman’s theory. Nevertheless, we show
in Section 3.6 that with small modifications, which we explicitly
identify, the trial Morse function can be transformed into a proper
Morse function @xmath . In theorem 3.6.1 we give an explicit definition
of the function @xmath and theorem 3.6.2 specifies its critical cells.
Since the number of critical cells and hence the size of the associated
Morse complex is small compared with the size of configuration space the
calculation of homology groups are greatly simplified. The technical
details of the proofs are given in the section 3.8 . In section 3.5 we
discuss more specifically how the techniques of discrete Morse theory
apply to the problem of quantum statistics on graphs.

### 3.2 Morse theory in the nutshell

In this section we briefly present both classical and discrete Morse
theories. We focus on the similarities between them and illustrate the
ideas by several simple examples.

#### 3.2.1 Classical Morse theory

The concept of classical Morse theory is essentially very similar to its
discrete counterpart. Since the former is better known we have found it
beneficial to first discuss the classical version. A good reference is
the monograph by Milnor [ 37 ] . Classical Morse theory is a useful tool
to describe topological properties of compact manifolds. Having such a
manifold @xmath we say that a smooth function @xmath is a Morse function
if its Hessian matrix at every critical point is nondegenerate, i.e.,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It can be shown that if @xmath is compact then @xmath has a finite
number of isolated critical points [ 37 ] . The classical Morse theory
is based on the following two facts:

1.  Let @xmath denote a sub level set of @xmath . Then @xmath is
    homotopy equivalent to @xmath if there is no critical value ² ² 2 A
    critical value of @xmath is the value of @xmath at one of its
    critical points. between the interval @xmath .

2.  The change in topology when @xmath goes through a critical value is
    determined by the index (i.e., the number of negative eigenvalues)
    of the Hessian matrix at the associated critical point.

The central point of classical Morse theory are the so-called Morse
inequalities, which relate the Betti numbers @xmath , i.e. the
dimensions of k-homology groups [ 25 ] , to the numbers @xmath of
critical points of index @xmath , i.e.,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath and @xmath is an arbitrary real number. In particular (
3.2.2 ) implies that @xmath . The function @xmath is called a perfect
Morse function iff @xmath for every @xmath . Since there is no general
prescription it is typically hard to find a perfect Morse function for a
given manifold @xmath . In fact a perfect Morse function may even not
exist [ 9 ] . However, even if @xmath is not perfect we can still encode
the topological properties of @xmath in a quite small cell complex.
Namely it follows from Morse theory that given a Morse function @xmath ,
one can show that @xmath is homotopic to a cell complex with @xmath
@xmath -cells, and the gluing maps can be constructed in terms of the
gradient paths of @xmath . We will not discuss this as it is far more
complicated than in the discrete case.

#### 3.2.2 Discrete Morse function

In this section we discuss the concept of discrete Morse functions for
cell complexes as introduced by Forman [ 18 ] . Let @xmath denote a
@xmath - cell. A discrete Morse function on a regular cell complex
@xmath is a function @xmath which assigns larger values to
higher-dimensional cells with ‘local’ exceptions.

###### Definition 3.2.1.

A function @xmath is a discrete Morse function iff for every @xmath we
have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.3)
     @xmath      (3.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In other words, definition 3.2.1 states that for any @xmath - cell
@xmath , there can be @xmath one @xmath - cell @xmath containing @xmath
for which @xmath is less than or equal to @xmath . Similarly, there can
be @xmath one @xmath - cell @xmath contained in @xmath for which @xmath
is greater than or equal to @xmath . Examples of a Morse function and a
non-Morse function are shown in figure 3.2 . The most important part of
discrete Morse theory is the definition of a critical cell:

###### Definition 3.2.2.

A cell @xmath is critical iff

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.5)
     @xmath      (3.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

That is, @xmath is critical if @xmath is greater than the value of
@xmath on all of the faces of @xmath , and @xmath is greater than the
value of @xmath on all cells containing @xmath as a face. From
definitions 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 , we get that a cell @xmath is noncritical
iff either

1.  @xmath or

2.  @xmath

It is quite important to understand that these two conditions cannot be
simultaneously fulfilled, as we now explain. Let us assume on the
contrary that both conditions (i) and (ii) hold. We have the following
sequence of cells:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Since @xmath is regular there is necessarily an @xmath such that @xmath
(see figures 3.1 (a),(b) for an intuitive explanation). Since @xmath ,
by definition 3.2.1 we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We also know that @xmath which, once again by definition 3.2.1 , implies
@xmath . Summing up we get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which is a contradiction.

Following the path of classical Morse theory we define next the level
sub-complex @xmath by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

That is, @xmath is the sub-complex containing all cells on which @xmath
is less or equal to @xmath , @xmath ³ ³ 3 Notice that the value of
@xmath on some of these faces might be bigger than @xmath . . Notice
that by definition ( 3.2.1 ) a Morse function does not have to be a
bijection. However, we have the following [ 18 ] :

###### Lemma 3.2.3.

For any Morse function @xmath , there exist another Morse function
@xmath which is 1-1 (injective) and which has the same critical cells as
@xmath .

The process of attaching cells is accompanied by two important lemmas
which describe the change in homotopy type of level sub-complexes when
critical or noncritical cells are attached. Since, from lemma 3.2.3 , we
can assume that a given Morse function is 1-1, we can always choose the
intervals @xmath below so that @xmath contains exactly one cell.

###### Lemma 3.2.4.

[ 18 ] If there are no critical cells @xmath with @xmath , then @xmath
is homotopy equivalent to @xmath .

###### Lemma 3.2.5.

[ 18 ] If there is a single critical cell @xmath with @xmath , then
@xmath is homotopy equivalent to

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and @xmath .

The above two lemmas lead to the following conclusion:

###### Theorem 3.2.6.

[ 18 ] Let @xmath be a cell complex and @xmath be a Morse function. Then
@xmath is homotopy equivalent to a cell complex with exactly one cell of
dimension @xmath for each critical cell @xmath

#### 3.2.3 Discrete Morse vector field

From theorem 3.2.6 it follows that a given cell complex is homotopy
equivalent to a cell complex containing only its critical cells, the
so-called Morse complex. The construction of the Morse complex, in
particular its boundary map (as well as the proof of theorem 3.2.6 ),
depends crucially on the concept of a discrete vector field, which we
define next. We know from definition 3.2.1 that the noncritical cells
can be paired. If a @xmath -cell is noncritical, then it is paired with
either the unique noncritical @xmath -cell on which @xmath takes an
equal or smaller value, or the unique noncritical @xmath -cell on which
@xmath takes an equal or larger value. In order to indicate this pairing
we draw an arrow from the @xmath -cell to the @xmath -cell in the first
case or from the @xmath -cell to the @xmath -cell in the second case
(see figure 3.3 ). Repeating this for all cells we get the so-called
discrete gradient vector field of the Morse function. It also follows
from section 3.2.2 that for every cell @xmath exactly one of the
following is true:

1.  @xmath is the tail of one arrow,

2.  @xmath is the head of one arrow,

3.  @xmath is neither the tail nor the head of an arrow.

Of course @xmath is critical iff it is neither the tail nor the head of
an arrow. Assume now that we are given a collection of arrows on some
cell complex satisfying the above three conditions. The question we
would like to address is whether it is a gradient vector field of some
Morse function. In order to answer this question we need to be more
precise. We define

###### Definition 3.2.7.

A discrete vector field @xmath on a cell complex @xmath is a collection
of pairs @xmath of cells such that each cell is in at most one pair of
@xmath .

Having a vector field it is natural to consider its ‘integral lines’. We
define the @xmath - path as a sequence of cells

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

such that @xmath and @xmath . Assume now that @xmath is a gradient
vector field of a discrete Morse function @xmath and consider a @xmath -
path ( 3.2.12 ). Then of course we have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This implies that if @xmath is a gradient vector field of the Morse
function then @xmath decreases along any @xmath -path which in
particular means that there are no closed @xmath -paths. It happens that
the converse is also true, namely a discrete vector field @xmath is a
gradient vector field of some Morse function iff there are no closed
@xmath - paths [ 18 ] .

#### 3.2.4 The Morse complex

Up to now we have learned how to reduce the number of cells of the
original cell complex to the critical ones. However, it is still not
clear how these cells are ‘glued’ together, i.e. what is the boundary
map between the critical cells? The following result relates the concept
of critical cells with discrete gradient vector fields [ 18 ] .

###### Theorem 3.2.8.

Assume that orientation has been chosen for each cell in the cell
complex @xmath . Then for any critical @xmath -cell @xmath we have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the boundary map in the cell complex consisting of the
critical cells, whose existence is guaranteed by theorem 3.2.6 , and

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the set of all @xmath - paths from the boundary of
@xmath to cells whose boundary contains @xmath and @xmath , depending on
whether the orientation induced from @xmath to @xmath through @xmath
agrees with the one chosen for @xmath .

The collection of critical cells together with the boundary map @xmath
is called the Morse complex of the function @xmath and we will denote it
by @xmath . Examples of the computation of boundary maps for Morse
complexes will be given in section 3.4 .

### 3.3 A perfect Morse function on @xmath and its discrete vector
field.

In this section we present a construction of a perfect discrete Morse
function on a @xmath - particle graph. It is defined analogously as in
the classical case, i.e. the number of critical cells in each dimension
is equal to the corresponding dimension of the homology group. The
existence of such a function will be used in section 3.4 to construct a
‘good’ but not necessarily perfect Morse function on a @xmath -particle
graph.

Let @xmath be a graph with @xmath vertices and @xmath edges. In the
following we assume that @xmath is connected and simple. Let @xmath be a
spanning tree of @xmath , i.e. @xmath is a connected spanning subgraph
of @xmath such that @xmath and for any pair of vertices @xmath there is
exactly one path in @xmath joining @xmath with @xmath . We naturally
have @xmath . The Euler characteristic of @xmath treated as a cell
complex is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Since @xmath is connected, @xmath . Hence we get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.2)
     @xmath      (3.3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

On the other hand it is well known that @xmath . Summing up from the
topological point of view @xmath is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum
of @xmath circles. Our goal is to construct a perfect Morse function
@xmath on @xmath , i.e. the one with exactly @xmath critical @xmath -
cells and one critical @xmath - cell. To this end we choose a vertex
@xmath of valency one in @xmath (it always exists) and travel through
the tree anticlockwise from it labeling vertices by @xmath . The value
of @xmath on the vertex @xmath is @xmath and the value of @xmath on the
edge @xmath is @xmath . The last step is to define @xmath on the deleted
edges @xmath . We choose @xmath , where @xmath are the boundary vertices
of @xmath . This way we obtain that all vertices besides @xmath and all
edges of @xmath are not critical cells of @xmath . The critical @xmath -
cells are exactly the deleted edges. The following example clarifies
this idea (see figure 3.4 ).

###### Example 3.3.1.

Consider the graph @xmath shown in figure 3.4 (a). Its spanning tree is
denoted by solid lines and the deleted edges by dashed lines. For each
vertex and edge the corresponding value of a perfect discrete Morse
function @xmath is explicitly written. Notice that according to
definition 3.2.2 we have exactly one critical @xmath - cell (denoted by
a square) and four critical @xmath - cells which are deleted edges. The
discrete vector field for @xmath is represented by arrows. The
contraction of @xmath along this field yields the contraction of @xmath
to a single point and hence the Morse complex @xmath is the wedge sum of
four circles (see figure 3.4 (b))

### 3.4 The main examples

In this section we present a method of construction of a ‘good’ Morse
function on the two particle configuration space @xmath for two
different graphs @xmath shown in figures 3.5 (a) and 3.7 (a). We also
demonstrate how to use the tools described in section 3.2 in order to
derive a Morse complex and compute the first homology group. We begin
with a graph @xmath which we will refer to as lasso (see figure 3.5
(a)). The spanning tree of @xmath is denoted in black in figure 3.5 (a).
In figure 3.5 (b) we see an example of the perfect Morse function @xmath
on @xmath together with its gradient vector field. They were constructed
according to the procedure explained in section 3.3 . The Morse complex
of @xmath consists of one @xmath -cell (the vertex @xmath ) and one
@xmath -cell (the edge @xmath ).

The two particle configuration space @xmath is shown in figure 3.6 (a).
Notice that @xmath consists of one @xmath - cell @xmath ⁴ ⁴ 4 This
notation should be understood as the Cartesian product of edges @xmath
and @xmath , hence a square. , six @xmath - cells and eight @xmath -
cells. In order to define the Morse function @xmath on @xmath we need to
specify its value for each of these cells. We begin with a trial
function @xmath which is completely determined once we know the perfect
Morse function on @xmath . To this end we treat @xmath as a kind of
‘potential energy’ of one particle. The function @xmath is simply the
sum of the energies of both particles, i.e. the value of @xmath on a
cell corresponding to a particular position of two particles on @xmath
is the sum of the values of @xmath corresponding to this position. To be
more precise we have for

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.4.1)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

In figure 3.6 (b) we can see @xmath together with @xmath . Observe that
@xmath is not a Morse function since the value of @xmath is the same as
the value of @xmath on edges @xmath and @xmath which are adjacent to the
vertex @xmath . The rule that @xmath - cell can be the face of at most
one @xmath - cell with smaller or equal value of @xmath is violated. In
order to have Morse function @xmath on @xmath we introduce one
modification, namely

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.4.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and @xmath is @xmath on the other cells.

Notice that the choice we made is not unique. We could have changed
@xmath in a similar way and leave @xmath untouched. After the
modification ( 3.4.2 ) we construct the corresponding discrete vector
field for @xmath . The Morse complex of @xmath consists of one critical
@xmath -cell (vertex @xmath ) and two critical @xmath - cells (edges
@xmath and @xmath ). Observe that there are two different mechanisms
responsible for criticality of these @xmath - cells. The cell @xmath is
critical due to the definition of trial Morse function @xmath and @xmath
has been chosen to be critical in order to make @xmath the well defined
Morse function @xmath . We will see later that these are in fact the
only two ways giving rise to the critical cells. Notice finally that
function @xmath is in fact a perfect Morse function and the Morse
inequalities for it are equalities.

We will now consider a more difficult example. The one particle
configuration space, i.e. graph @xmath together with the perfect Morse
function and its gradient vector field are shown in figure 3.7 (a) and
3.7 (b).

The construction of two particle configuration space is a bit more
elaborate than in the lasso case and the result is shown in figure 3.8
(a). Using rules given in ( 3.4.1 ) we obtain the trial Morse function
@xmath which is shown in figure 3.8 (b). The critical cells of @xmath
and the cells causing @xmath to not be a Morse function are given in
table 3.1.

In figure 3.8 (b) we have chosen @xmath - cells: @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath to be critical, although we should emphasize that it is one
choice out of eight possible ones. We will now determine the first
homology group of the Morse complex @xmath and hence @xmath . The Morse
complex @xmath is the sum of @xmath consisting of one @xmath -cell
(vertex @xmath ), @xmath which consists of five critical @xmath -cells
and @xmath which is one critical @xmath -cell @xmath .

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

The first homology is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.4.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It is easy to see that @xmath for any @xmath and hence @xmath . What is
left is to find @xmath which is a linear combination of critical @xmath
-cells from @xmath . According to formula ( 3.2.14 ) we take the
boundary of @xmath in @xmath and consider all paths starting from it and
ending at the @xmath -cells containing critical @xmath -cells (see table
3.2).

Eventually taking into account orientation we get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.4.4)
     @xmath      (3.4.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Hence,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.4.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The Morse complex @xmath is shown explicitly in figure 3.8 (c). It is
worth mentioning that in this example @xmath is not a perfect Morse
function.

### 3.5 Discrete Morse theory and topological gauge potentials

In this section we describe more specifically how the techniques of
discrete Morse theory apply to the problem of quantum statistics on
graphs. A more general discussion of the model can be found in [ 26 ] .
Here we describe a particular representative example, highlighting the
usefulness of discrete Morse theory.

Let @xmath be a graph shown in figure 3.5 (a). The Hilbert space
associated to @xmath is @xmath and is spanned by the vertices of @xmath
. The dynamics is given by Schrödinger equation where the Hamiltonian
@xmath is a hermitian matrix, such that @xmath if @xmath is not adjacent
to @xmath in @xmath . As discussed in [ 26 ] this corresponds to the
so-called tight binding model of one-particle dynamics on @xmath . One
can add to the model an additional ingredient, namely whenever the
particle hops between adjacent vertices of @xmath the wavefunction gains
an additional phase factor. This can be incorporated to the Hamiltonian
by introducing a gauge potential. It is an antisymmetric real matrix
@xmath such that each @xmath and @xmath if @xmath is not adjacent to
@xmath in @xmath . The modified Hamiltonian is then @xmath . The flux of
@xmath through any cycle of @xmath is the sum of values of @xmath on the
directed edges of the cycle. It can be given a physical interpretation
in terms of the Aharonov-Bohm phase.

In order to describe in a similar manner the dynamics of two
indistinguishable particles on @xmath we follow the procedure given in [
26 ] . The structure of the Hilbert space and the corresponding tight
binding Hamiltonian are encoded in @xmath . Namely, we have @xmath and
is spanned by the vertices of @xmath . The Hamiltonian is given by a
hermitian matrix, such that @xmath if @xmath is not adjacent to @xmath
in @xmath . The notation @xmath describes two vertices @xmath and @xmath
connected by an edge in @xmath . The additional assumption which we add
in this case stems from the topological structure of @xmath and is
reflected in the condition on the gauge potential. Namely, since the
2-cell @xmath is contractible we require that the flux through its
boundary vanishes, i.e.

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.5.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Our goal is to find the parametrization of all gauge potentials
satisfying ( 3.5.1 ), up to a so-called trivial gauge, i.e. up to
addition of @xmath such that @xmath , for any cycle @xmath . To this end
we use discrete Morse theory. We first notice that the edges of @xmath
which are heads of an arrow of the discrete Morse vector field form a
tree. Without loss of generality we can put @xmath whenever @xmath is a
head of an arrow. Next, on the edges corresponding to the critical
@xmath -cells we put arbitrary phases @xmath and @xmath . Notice that
since @xmath is a perfect Morse function these phases are independent.
The only remaining edge is @xmath which is a tail of an arrow. In order
to decide what phase should be put on it we follow the gradient path of
the discrete Morse vector field which leads to edge @xmath . Hence
@xmath . The effect of our construction is the topological gauge
potential @xmath which is given by two independent parameters (see
figure 3.6 (d)) and satisfies ( 3.5.1 ). The described reasoning can be
mutatis mutandis applied to any graph @xmath , albeit the phases on
edges corresponding to the critical cells are not independent if @xmath
is not a perfect Morse function. Finally notice, that in the considered
example, the phase @xmath can be interpreted as an Aharonov-Bohm phase
and @xmath as the exchange phase. The latter gives rise to anyon
statistics.

### 3.6 General consideration for two particles

In this section we investigate the first Homology group @xmath by means
of discrete Morse theory. In section 3.4 the idea of a trial Morse
function was introduced. Let us recall here that the trial Morse
function is defined in two steps. The first one is to define a perfect
Morse function on @xmath . To this end one chooses a spanning tree
@xmath in @xmath . The vertices of @xmath are labeled by @xmath
according to the procedure described in section 3.3 . The perfect Morse
function @xmath on @xmath is then given by its value on the vertices and
edges of @xmath , i.e.

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.6.1)
     @xmath      (3.6.2)
     @xmath      (3.6.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

When @xmath is specified the trial Morse function on @xmath is given by
the formula

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.6.4)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

Let us emphasize that the trial Morse function is typically not a Morse
function, i.e., the conditions of definition 3.2.1 might not be
satisfied. Nevertheless, we will show that it is always possible to
modify the function @xmath and obtain a Morse function @xmath out of it.
In fact the function @xmath is not ’far’ from being a Morse function
and, as we will see, the number of cells at which it needs fixing is
relatively small. In the next paragraphs we localize the obstructions
causing @xmath to not be a Morse function and explain how to overcome
them.

The cell complex @xmath consists of @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath -cells
which we will denote by @xmath , @xmath and @xmath respectively. For all
these cells we have to verify the conditions of definition 3.2.1 .
Notice that checking these conditions for any cell involves looking at
its higher and lower dimensional neighbours. In case of @xmath -cell
@xmath we have only the former ones, i.e., the @xmath -cells @xmath in
the boundary of @xmath . For the @xmath -cell @xmath both @xmath -cells
@xmath and @xmath -cells @xmath are present. Finally for the @xmath
-cell @xmath we have only @xmath -cells @xmath .

Our strategy is the following. We begin with the trial Morse function
@xmath and go over all @xmath -cells checking the conditions of
definition 3.2.1 . The outcome of this step is a new trial Morse
function @xmath which has no defects on @xmath -cells. Next we consider
all @xmath -cells and verify the conditions of definition 3.2.1 for
@xmath . It happens that they are satisfied. Finally we go over all
@xmath -cells. The result of this three-steps procedure is a well
defined Morse function @xmath . Below we present more detailed
discussion. The proofs of all statements are in section 3.8 .

1.   Step 1 We start with a trial Morse function @xmath . We notice
    first that for any edge @xmath there is a unique vertex @xmath in
    its boundary such that @xmath . In other words every vertex @xmath ,
    different from @xmath , specifies exactly one edge @xmath which we
    will denote by @xmath . Next we divide the set of @xmath -cells into
    three disjoint classes. The first one contains @xmath -cells @xmath
    , where both @xmath . The second one contains @xmath -cells @xmath ,
    where @xmath and @xmath , and the last one contains @xmath -cells
    @xmath , where both @xmath . Now, since there are no @xmath -cells,
    we have only to check that for each @xmath -cell @xmath

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (3.6.5)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    The following results are proved in section 3.8

    1.  For the @xmath -cells @xmath where both @xmath the condition (
        3.6.5 ) is satisfied (see fact 2 ).

    2.  For the @xmath -cells @xmath where @xmath and @xmath the
        condition ( 3.6.5 ) is satisfied (see fact 3 ).

    3.  For the @xmath -cells @xmath where both @xmath the condition (
        3.6.5 ) is not satisfied. There are exactly two @xmath -cells
        @xmath such that @xmath . They are of the form @xmath and @xmath
        . The function @xmath can be fixed in two ways (see fact 4 ). We
        put @xmath and either @xmath or @xmath . In both cases @xmath is
        the pair of noncritical cells.

    The result of this step is a new trial Morse function @xmath , which
    satisfies ( 3.6.5 ).

2.   Step 2 We divide the set of @xmath -cells into two disjoint
    classes. The first one contains @xmath -cells @xmath , where @xmath
    and the second one contains @xmath , where @xmath . For the @xmath
    -cells within each of this classes we introduce additional division
    with respect to condition @xmath (or @xmath ). Notice that all
    @xmath -cells @xmath which were modified in Step 1 belong to the
    second class and satisfy @xmath . Next we take a trial Morse
    function @xmath and go over all @xmath -cells @xmath checking for
    each of them if

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (3.6.6)
         @xmath      (3.6.7)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    What we find out is

    1.  For the @xmath -cells @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath the
        conditions ( 3.6.6 , 3.6.7 ) are satisfied (see fact 5 ).

    2.  For the @xmath -cells @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath the
        conditions ( 3.6.6 , 3.6.7 ) are satisfied (see fact 6 ).

    3.  For the @xmath -cells @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath the
        conditions ( 3.6.6 , 3.6.7 ) are satisfied (see fact 7 ).

    4.  For the @xmath -cells @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath the
        conditions ( 3.6.6 , 3.6.7 ) are satisfied (see fact 8 ).

    Summing up the trial Morse function @xmath , obtained in Step 1
    satisfies both ( 3.6.5 ) and ( 3.6.6 ), ( 3.6.7 ). We switch now to
    the analysis of @xmath -cells.

3.   Step 3 We divide the set of @xmath -cells into four disjoint
    classes in the following way. We denote by @xmath the vertex to
    which @xmath is adjacent and call it the terminal vertex of @xmath .
    For any @xmath -cell @xmath we have that either

    1.  @xmath and the terminal vertex @xmath of @xmath is equal to
        @xmath .

    2.  @xmath and the terminal vertex @xmath of @xmath is equal to the
        terminal vertex @xmath of @xmath .

    3.  @xmath .

    4.  @xmath .

    What is left is checking the following condition for any @xmath
    -cell @xmath :

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (3.6.8)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    We find out that

    1.  For the @xmath -cell @xmath belonging to 3a the condition (
        3.6.8 ) is satisfied (see fact 9 ).

    2.  For the @xmath -cell @xmath belonging to 3b the condition (
        3.6.8 ) is not satisfied. There are exactly two @xmath -cells
        @xmath such that @xmath . They are of the form @xmath and @xmath
        . The function @xmath can be fixed in two ways. We put @xmath or
        @xmath (see fact 10 ). Moreover, this change does not violate
        the Morse conditions at any @xmath -cell containing @xmath .

    3.  For the @xmath -cell @xmath belonging to 3c the condition (
        3.6.8 ) is satisfied (see fact 11 )

    4.  For the @xmath -cell @xmath belonging to 3d the condition (
        3.6.8 ) is satisfied (see fact 12 )

As a result of the above procedure we obtain the Morse function @xmath .
The following theorem summarizes the above described procedure.

###### Theorem 3.6.1.

Let @xmath be a perfect Morse function on a @xmath -particle graph
@xmath defined by ( 3.6.1 ). Define a trial Morse function @xmath on
@xmath by @xmath . A Morse function @xmath on @xmath is the modification
of @xmath obtained in the following way:

1.   For @xmath -cells of the form @xmath where both @xmath , increment
    @xmath by @xmath and increment either @xmath or @xmath by @xmath as
    well.

2.   For @xmath -cells of the form @xmath where @xmath , increment
    either @xmath or @xmath by 1.

We can now ask the question which cells of @xmath are critical cells of
@xmath . Careful consideration of the arguments given in facts 2 - 12
lead to the following conclusions:

###### Theorem 3.6.2.

The conditions for the critical cells of @xmath are

-    The @xmath -cell is critical if and only if it is @xmath

-    The @xmath -cell is critical if and only if

    1.   It is @xmath where @xmath and @xmath or @xmath .

    2.   Assume that @xmath and the terminal vertex @xmath of @xmath is
        equal to the terminal vertex @xmath of @xmath . Then either the
        @xmath -cell @xmath or the @xmath -cell @xmath is critical, but
        not both.

-    The @xmath -cell is critical if and only if it is @xmath where both
    @xmath .

These rules are related to those given by Farley and Sabalka in [ 21 ] .
As pointed out by an anonymous referee the freedom in choosing
noncritical @xmath -cells (see fact 3 in section 3.8 ) and critical
@xmath -cells (see fact 9 in section 3.8 ) is also present in Farley and
Sabalka’s [ 21 ] construction. Moreover, a perfect Morse function on a
@xmath -particle graph used in our construction stems from the labeling
of the tree discussed in [ 21 ] .

### 3.7 Summary

We have presented a description of topological properties of
two-particle graph configuration spaces in terms of discrete Morse
theory. Our approach is through discrete Morse functions, which may be
regarded as two-particle potential energies. We proceeded by introducing
a trial Morse function on the full two-particle cell complex, @xmath ,
which is simply the sum of single-particle potentials on the
one-particle cell complex, @xmath . We showed that the trial Morse
function is close to being a true Morse function provided that the
single-particle potential is a perfect Morse function on @xmath .
Moreover, we give an explicit prescription for removing local defects.
The fixing process is unique modulo the freedom described in facts 4 and
10 . The construction was demonstrated by two examples. A future goal
would be to see if these constructions can provide any simplification in
understanding of the results of [ 30 ] . It will be also interesting to
verify if the presented techniques can be extended to @xmath -particle
graphs and if they lead to analogous results as in [ 21 ] . The
preliminary calculations indicate that the answer is positive, however
small modifications of a perfect Morse function on a @xmath -particle
graph are needed.

Finally, notice that using our analogy with the potential energy a trial
Morse function is constructed as if particles do not interact. The
modification of a trail Morse function can be hence viewed as
introducing an interaction. On the other hand, in the considered graph
setting, quantum statistics or anyons can be regarded as fermions which
interact in some particular way. Remarkably, the modifications of a
trial Morse function in particular these described in point 2 of theorem
3.6.1 correspond to situations when two particles come close together.

### 3.8 Proofs

In this section we give the proofs of the statements made in section 3.6
. The following notation will be used. We denote by @xmath all edges of
@xmath which are adjacent to @xmath and belong to @xmath . Similarly by
@xmath we denote all edges of @xmath which are adjacent to @xmath and
belong to @xmath , except one distinguished edge @xmath , but not in
@xmath .

###### Fact 2.

Let @xmath be a @xmath -cell such that both @xmath and @xmath do not
belong to @xmath . The condition ( 3.6.5 ) is satisfied and @xmath is a
critical cell.

Proof. The two cell @xmath is shown in the figure 3.9 , where @xmath and
@xmath and @xmath , @xmath . The result follows immediately from this
figure.

###### Fact 3.

Let @xmath be a @xmath -cell, where @xmath and @xmath . Condition (
3.6.5 ) is satisfied and @xmath is a noncritical cell.

Proof. We of course assume that @xmath . The @xmath -cell @xmath is
shown on figure 3.10 , where we denoted @xmath and @xmath . The result
follows immediately from this figure.

###### Fact 4.

Let @xmath be the @xmath -cells, where both @xmath . Condition ( 3.6.5 )
is not satisfied. There are exactly two @xmath -cells @xmath such that
@xmath . They are of the form @xmath and @xmath . The function @xmath
can be fixed in two ways. We put @xmath and either @xmath or @xmath .

Proof. The @xmath -cell @xmath when @xmath is presented in figure 3.11
(a),(b). The trail Morse function @xmath requires fixing and two
possibilities are shown on figure 3.11 (c),(d). Notice that in both
cases we get a pair of noncritical cells. Namely the @xmath -cell @xmath
and @xmath -cell @xmath for the situation presented in figure 3.11 (c)
and @xmath -cell @xmath , @xmath -cell @xmath for the situation
presented in figure 3.11 (d).

###### Fact 5.

For the @xmath -cells @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath the conditions (
3.6.6 , 3.6.7 ) are satisfied.

Proof. Let us first calculate @xmath . To this end we have to check if
@xmath was modified in step 1. Notice that every @xmath -cell which has
@xmath in its boundary is one of the following forms:

1.  @xmath

2.  @xmath with @xmath

3.  @xmath with @xmath

Case ( 1 ) is impossible since @xmath . For any @xmath -cell belonging
to ( 2 ) the value of @xmath was not modified on the boundary of @xmath
(see fact 3 ). Finally, for @xmath -cells belonging to ( 3 ) the value
of @xmath was modified on the boundary of @xmath but not on the cell
@xmath (see fact 3). Hence @xmath . Let us now verify condition ( 3.6.7
). The @xmath -cell @xmath is adjacent to exactly two @xmath -cells,
namely @xmath and @xmath . We have @xmath and @xmath . Now since @xmath
condition ( 3.6.7 ) is satisfied. For condition ( 3.6.6 ) we have only
to examine @xmath -cells of forms ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) (listed above). For
@xmath -cells that belong to ( 2 ) we have @xmath and for @xmath -cells
that belong to ( 3 ) we have @xmath . Hence in both cases @xmath and
condition ( 3.6.6 ) is satisfied.

###### Fact 6.

For the @xmath -cells @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath conditions (
3.6.6 , 3.6.7 ) are satisfied.

Proof. Let us first calculate @xmath . To this end we have to check if
@xmath was modified in step 1. Notice that every @xmath -cell which has
@xmath in its boundary is one of the following forms:

1.  @xmath

2.  @xmath with @xmath

3.  @xmath with @xmath

Case ( 1 ) is impossible since @xmath . For any @xmath -cell belonging
to ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) the value of @xmath was not modified on the boundary
of @xmath (see fact 2 and 3 ). Hence @xmath . Let us now verify
condition ( 3.6.7 ). To this end assume that @xmath with @xmath . The
@xmath -cell @xmath is adjacent to exactly two @xmath -cells, namely
@xmath and @xmath . We have @xmath and @xmath . Now since @xmath
condition ( 3.6.7 ) is satisfied. For condition ( 3.6.6 ) we have only
to examine @xmath -cells of forms ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) (listed above). It is
easy to see that in both cases @xmath .

###### Fact 7.

For the @xmath -cells @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath conditions (
3.6.6 , 3.6.7 ) are satisfied.

Proof. Let us first calculate @xmath . To this end we have to check if
@xmath was modified in step 1. Notice that every @xmath -cell which has
@xmath in its boundary is one of the following forms:

1.  @xmath

2.  @xmath with @xmath

3.  @xmath with @xmath

For any @xmath -cell belonging to ( 2 ) the value of @xmath was not
modified on the boundary of @xmath (see fact 3 ). For the @xmath -cells
belonging to ( 3 ) the value of @xmath was modified on the boundary of
@xmath but not on the cell @xmath (see fact 3). Finally for the @xmath
-cell @xmath the value of @xmath was modified on the boundary of @xmath
and by fact 4 it might be the case that it was modified on @xmath .
Hence @xmath or @xmath . Let us now verify condition ( 3.6.7 ). The
@xmath -cell @xmath is adjacent to exactly two @xmath -cells, namely
@xmath and @xmath . We have @xmath and @xmath . Now since @xmath
condition ( 3.6.7 ) is satisfied. For condition ( 3.6.6 ) we have to
examine @xmath -cells from ( 1 ), ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) (listed above). In
case when @xmath it is easy to see that @xmath for @xmath and @xmath .
For @xmath we still have @xmath for @xmath and @xmath . Hence condition
( 3.6.6 ) is satisfied in both cases.

###### Fact 8.

For the @xmath -cells @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath conditions (
3.6.6 , 3.6.7 ) are satisfied.

Proof. Let us first calculate @xmath . To this end we have to check if
@xmath was modified in step 1. Notice that every @xmath -cell which has
@xmath in its boundary is one of the following forms:

1.  @xmath

2.  @xmath with @xmath

3.  @xmath with @xmath

For any @xmath -cell belonging to ( 1 ), ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) the value of
@xmath was not modified on the boundary of an appropriate @xmath -cell
(see fact 3 and 4 ). Hence @xmath . Let us now verify condition ( 3.6.7
). To this end assume that @xmath with @xmath . The @xmath -cell @xmath
is adjacent to exactly two @xmath -cells, namely @xmath and @xmath . We
have @xmath and @xmath . Now since @xmath condition ( 3.6.7 ) is
satisfied. For condition ( 3.6.6 ) we have to examine @xmath -cells form
( 1 ), ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) (listed above). It is easy to see that @xmath for
@xmath and @xmath .

###### Fact 9.

For the @xmath -cell @xmath such that @xmath with the terminal vertex
@xmath of @xmath equal to @xmath , condition ( 3.6.8 ) is satisfied.

Proof. The situation when @xmath and terminal vertex @xmath of @xmath is
equal to @xmath is presented in the figure 3.12 . For the @xmath -cell
@xmath we have @xmath . Notice that there is exactly one edge @xmath for
which @xmath . The function @xmath on the other edges adjacent to @xmath
have a value greater than @xmath and hence @xmath and @xmath constitute
a pair of noncritical cells.

###### Fact 10.

For the @xmath -cell @xmath such that @xmath with the terminal vertex
@xmath of @xmath equal to the terminal vertex @xmath of @xmath condition
( 3.6.8 ) is not satisfied. There are exactly two @xmath -cells @xmath
such that @xmath . They are of the form @xmath and @xmath . The function
@xmath can be fixed in two ways. We put @xmath or @xmath .

Proof. The situation when @xmath and terminal vertex @xmath of @xmath is
equal to terminal vertex @xmath of @xmath is presented in the figure
3.13 (a),(b). For the @xmath -cell @xmath we have @xmath . There are two
edges @xmath and @xmath such that @xmath . It is easy to see that the
value of @xmath on the other edges adjacent to @xmath is greater than
@xmath . So the function @xmath does not satisfy condition ( 3.6.8 ) and
there are two possibilities 3.13 (c),(d) to fix this problem. Either we
put @xmath or @xmath . They both yield that the vertex @xmath is
non-critical. Notice finally that by the definitions of @xmath and
@xmath , increasing the value of @xmath by one does not influence @xmath
-cells containing @xmath in their boundary.

###### Fact 11.

For the @xmath -cell @xmath such that @xmath condition ( 3.6.8 ) is
satisfied.

Proof. This is a direct consequence of the modification made for the
@xmath -cell @xmath in step 1. Moreover, @xmath is noncritical.

###### Fact 12.

For the @xmath -cell @xmath condition ( 3.6.8 ) is satisfied.

Proof. For the @xmath -cell @xmath we have @xmath . Notice that there is
exactly one edge @xmath for which @xmath . The function @xmath on the
other edges adjacent to @xmath have a value greater than @xmath . Hence
if @xmath the @xmath -cell @xmath and the @xmath -cell @xmath constitute
a pair of noncritical cells. Otherwise @xmath is a critical @xmath
-cell.

## Chapter 4 Summary and outlook

In this thesis we developed a new set of ideas and methods which gave a
full characterization of all possible abelian quantum statistics on
graphs. Our approach enabled identification of the key topological
determinants of the quantum statistics:

1.  the connectivity of a graph,

2.  the first homology group @xmath , where @xmath is the number of
    independent cycles in @xmath and @xmath determines quantum
    statistics

3.  for @xmath -connected graphs number of anyon phases depends on the
    number of particles,

4.  for @xmath -connected graphs quantum statistics stabilizes with
    respect to the number of particles @xmath ,

5.  for @xmath -connected non-planar graphs @xmath , i.e. the usual
    bosonic/fermionic statistics is the only possibility whereas planar
    @xmath -connected graphs support one anyon phase, @xmath . Thus,
    from the quantum statistics perspective, one can say that @xmath
    -connected graphs mimic @xmath when they are planar and @xmath when
    not.

It seems that the following problems can be approached using the methods
developed in this thesis.

Problem 1 . It was noticed by V. I. Arnold in the late 1960’s [ 4 , 5 ]
, and then generalized to some classes of manifolds, that the cohomology
groups of the @xmath possess three basic properties:

1.  finiteness: @xmath are finite except @xmath , @xmath for @xmath ;
    also @xmath for @xmath ,

2.  recurrence: @xmath ,

3.  stabilization: @xmath for @xmath .

These raises the following questions in graph’s context:

-   what is the minimal connectivity of @xmath that gives stabilization
    of @xmath for planar and non-planar graphs?,

-   Is ’quantum statistics’ components of @xmath given by the torsion
    part of @xmath , for @xmath ,

-   what is the minimal connectivity of @xmath for which ’quantum
    statistics’ components of @xmath up to the given @xmath are the same
    as for @xmath and @xmath , i.e. when planar graphs mimic @xmath up
    to @xmath and non-planar graphs mimic @xmath up @xmath for given
    @xmath .

Problem 2. The aim is to lay the foundations for the understanding of
the influence of complex topology, which gives rise to generalized anyon
statistics, on many-particle transport properties of complex networks.
The principal attraction of quantum graphs is that they provide
mathematically tractable models of complex physical systems. The fact
that anyon statistics is present for many-particle graph configuration
spaces gives at least a priori various possible applications of this
model. Using graph models one can investigate topological signatures and
effects of quantum statistics in many-particle generalizations of a
single-particle transport on networks. This should provide models and
variants of the quantum Hall effect extending to many-particle quantum
systems the transport theory for networks developed by Avron (see for
example [ 6 , 7 , 8 ] ).

Problem 3. The importance of topology and geometry in quantum
information theory is present on both foundational and application
levels. Of course the Holy Grail in this area of research is still the
construction of a quantum computer. One of the difficulties in building
a many-qubit quantum computer is quantum decoherence. Physical systems
typically remain in a coherent superposition of states for a very short
time because generic interactions with the environment will decohere
them, destroying the information encoded in quantum states. Recently, a
new approach based on topology has been proposed to overcome some of the
difficulties of this kind [ 28 ] . In simple words the idea is motivated
by the fact that topological invariants are very robust. So if
information is encoded in topology it is hard to destroy it as it is
immune to a large class of perturbations. More precisely, topological
quantum computing is based on the concept of anyons, and in particular,
non-abelian anyons [ 28 ] . One of the most profound examples of these
ideas is the celebrated Kitaev toric code, which is a realization of
topological quantum error correcting code on a two-dimensional spin
lattice [ 29 ] . The excitations for this model were proved to be of
anyon type [ 29 ] . It is therefore natural to expect that the anyon
statistics which are present on graph configuration spaces might be
related to these ideas. One of the explicit tasks would be to construct
a spin graph model for which excitations behave exactly like anyons
corresponding to many-particle graph configuration spaces. It is also
believed that the fractional Quantum Hall States are promising
candidates for physical realization of topological computing [ 39 ] . So
the study of transport properties described in the previous paragraphs
is inevitably related to these concepts

Problem 4. The entanglement of integer and fractional Quantum Hall
States has recently been studied by several authors (see for example [
42 , 34 ] ). An interesting problem would be to calculate the
entanglement of eigenstates of many-particle graph configuration spaces
with the topological gauge potential supporting anyon quantum
statistics. When the topological gauge potential vanishes the
Hamiltonian of the system is a non-interacting fermionic Hamiltonian.
When this Hamiltonian has a non-degenerate spectrum, its eigenstates are
given in terms of Slater determinants. Otherwise the topological gauge
potential introduces an interaction to the system, so that eigenstates
of Hamiltonian might be entangled. It seems interesting to understand
how the degree of entanglement for these states is related to the
topological invariants of the one-particle graph, e.g. its connectivity
and planarity.
