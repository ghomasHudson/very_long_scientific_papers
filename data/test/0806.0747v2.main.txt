## Chapter 1 Introduction

Judging from current experimental activities, one of the pertinent
questions that nuclear physicists are trying to answer is: What was the
state of matter, at a time when the universe was very hot and dense?
High-energy collisions of heavy-ions, such as the ones performed in the
PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and
planned at CERN in the ALICE experiment, aim to study such hot, dense
nuclear matter [ 1 , 2 ] . More specifically the experiments at RHIC aim
to study the state of matter, called quark-gluon plasma , which is
believed to be the state of matter shortly after the Big Bang [ 1 ] .
Another question, that is currently investigated in earnest by nuclear
physicists, is if the structure of normal nuclear matter (protons and
neutrons) breaks down under conditions of low temperature and extreme
pressure, i.e. whether the ground state of nuclear matter consists out
of matter other than nuclear matter. To answer this question, nuclear
physicists must look further afield than laboratory experiments. In
laboratory experiments, where either two beams of high energy particles
are collided or high energy particles are shot onto a target, a highly
energetic, but short-lived state of matter is created, which is rather
far removed from the ground state of matter [ 3 ] . A physical system is
in its ground state when the system is in its lowest energy
configuration. The ground state is usually achieved after the system had
some time to equilibrate. @xmath Fe is the nucleus with the greatest
(negative) binding energy and therefore has the lowest ground state of
all the nuclei. Questions have been raised whether @xmath Fe is the
ultimate ground state of matter since W. Baade and E. Zwicky proposed in
1934 that some supernovae are driven by the binding energy of a neutron
star [ 4 ] , i.e. that a massive star explodes due to the release of
energy in forming a neutron star. On average neutron stars have a mass
of about 1.4 times the mass of our sun [ 5 ] . The gravitational binding
energy of a neutron star is about 10 @xmath of its mass, while the
nuclear binding energy of @xmath Fe is about 9 MeV/nucleon, which is
about 1 @xmath of the mass of a @xmath Fe nucleus [ 4 ] . Thus the
gravitational binding energy of a neutron star consisting of @xmath Fe
would be about ten times larger than the nuclear binding energy. Since
the star is in a stable long-lived state, one can assume that the matter
is in a state other than that of @xmath Fe. As such nature has provided
us with a laboratory to study cold, dense matter, which we currently
cannot synthesise in the laboratory. (By cold is meant that the thermal
energy of the particles is very small compared to the fermi energy and
thus thermal excitations are assumed not to take place [ 4 , 6 ] .)
Neutron stars are believed to be formed in the core-collapse supernovae
of massive stars [ 4 , 7 ] . A normal star is stabilised against
gravitational collapse by the thermal pressure due to the energy release
of nuclear fusion processes in the star. Fusion in the core of the star
would proceed the fastest due to the higher pressure at the centre of
the star. Once these fusion processes have reached the formation of
@xmath Fe, the last exothermic fusion phases, it will shut down and the
core will start to cool and contract under its own gravity [ 4 ] . As
the core contracts densities where electrons become relativistic will
quite easily be reached. The energy of the core can thus be reduced by
the capture of electrons by the protons (inverse beta-decay), thus
making the core more neutron-rich [ 7 ] . The crushing effect of gravity
will be halted by the short-ranged repulsion of the strong nuclear
force.
Matter falling onto the core, due to the low pressure created by the
contracting core, would rebound off the stiffened core, creating a
shockwave that travels outward from the centre of the star, which stalls
after some hundred kilometres, due to energy losses as the wave travels
through the interior of the star. This stalled shockwave creates an
accreting front as matter from the outer parts of the star collapses
towards the centre of the star. Through poorly understood mechanisms the
binding energy of the neutron star (the core of the collapsing star)
gets transferred to the accreting shock front, which causes the rest of
the star to explode in a supernova. [ 4 ]
In 1967 Jocelyn Bell observed a pulsating radio-source in outer space
that had characteristics unlike any other radio-source [ 9 ] . Initially
the origin of these radio-pulses was unclear (little green men were not
ruled out), but eventually the source was explained to be a rapidly
rotating neutron star, today known as a pulsar [ 10 , 11 ] . Today more
than 1100 pulsars, the commonly observed state of neutron stars, are
known [ 4 ] .
As with the question regarding the ultimate ground state of matter, the
constituents of the interior of neutron stars are also not known. As the
average densities of neutron stars are comparable to that of nuclei, it
is assumed that neutron stars consist (at least in some part) of
baryonic matter (such as protons and neutrons) and therefore can be
viewed as giant nuclei, but with a mass number of @xmath [ 7 ] ! The
main difference between nuclei and neutron stars is that while nuclei
are bound by the nuclear strong force, neutron stars are bound by
gravity. The fact that gravity is attractive on all scales implies that
the neutron star must have some form of internal pressure to counteract
the effect of gravity, otherwise no stable neutron stars would exists,
only black holes (objects that have collapsed under their own gravity).
Baade and Zwicky envisioned that a neutron star is supported against
gravitational collapse by the nucleon degeneracy pressure: the pressure
that is due to Pauli’s Exclusion Principle that states that no two
identical particles can occupy the same energy state. Thus the pressure
is given by particles that all want to occupy the lowest energy state,
but these states are filled from the bottom and once they are full
particles have to occupy higher lying states [ 4 ] . Due to the central
role of gravity, neutron stars can only be adequately described using
the general theory of relativity [ 4 ] . In Chapter 2 necessary concepts
in relativity will be introduced to formulate such a description, which
will be derived in Chapter 3 .
But that would not be the full story. To be able to have such an
adequate, relativistic description of neutron stars information
regarding the relation between the pressure and the energy density
(equation of state) of matter in the interior of the neutron star is
needed. If we assume that the neutron star consists of baryonic matter,
models of nuclear matter can be used to provide the equation of state of
the neutron star interior [ 4 , 6 , 7 ] . Fig. 1.1 shows a schematic
presentation of various assumptions about the interior of neutron stars
(and as such for the ground state of matter).

These different models for the interior of the neutron star can be
tested by comparing calculated properties, specifically the mass-radius
relationship fo a neutron star, to the observed values. By this process
suitable models (and equations of state derived from these models) can
be identified for the description of cold, dense matter. In general
these different models of nuclei and nuclear matter are complex and
difficult to solve exactly and therefore these models have to be
approximated. The focus of this work will be to derive the equation of
state of neutron star matter from a specific model of nuclei and nuclear
matter, called quantum hadrodynamics (QHD), through the application of
relativistic mean-field theory. This will be done by making a survey of
some of the available literature on this subject as well as to try to
reproduce some of the published values of certain properties of nuclear
matter and neutron stars. The aim of this work is to consolidate some of
the current knowledge in the theoretical study of neutron stars. Since
these theoretical studies can only be validated through good agreement
with observed properties of neutron stars, close co-operation between
theorists and astronomers are crucial in the study of neutron stars. The
converse is also true: to explain observational results theoretical
modelling is needed to predict certain observed properties. Only through
this interplay between theoretical and observational science can the
understanding of our universe be advanced. This work therefore also aims
to include some of the observational results to constrain the
theoretical calculations.
It is foreseen that much more will be learned about neutron stars with
the commission of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). The SKA will be the
world’s biggest radio-telescope, with an effective collecting area of
one square kilometre, which will make the SKA fifty times more powerful
than the current most powerful radio-telescope [ 12 , 13 ] . To explain
the observations made by the SKA knowledge of the theoretical modelling
of neutron stars would be crucial.

### 1.1 South African perspective

This work is applicable within the South African context since South
Africa is currently developing the meerKAT radio-telescope, formerly
known as the Karoo Array Telescope (KAT), and has also been shortlisted
to host SKA [ 13 ] . It is foreseen that the meerKAT will be the largest
radio-telescope in the world, until the SKA is commissioned, thus South
Africa will have a strategic advance in, amongst others, the study of
pulsars and neutron stars.
KAT-7, a seven-dish engineering test bed, will be commissioned towards
the end of 2009 and it is foreseen that the full fifty-dish array will
be completed by 2012 [ 13 ] .
The development of the meerKAT could not only be of importance to
radio-astronomers but also to nuclear physicists studying dense matter.
This work can be seen as one example of how nuclear physics can be
advanced by using data gathered from outer space.

### 1.2 Conventions and notations

In this thesis the following conventions and notations will be used.

#### 1.2.1 Vectors, fields and operators

Three dimensional vectors will be expressed in bold font, e.g. @xmath ,
or using Latin indices, @xmath . Four dimensional vectors will be
denoted by the Lorentz (Greek) indices, e.g. @xmath . In the case of the
position vector, @xmath , it is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In most instances the Lorentz index in the four-vector will be
suppressed, after it has been initially defined with the index.
The explicit dependence of a field on spacetime coordinates will be
suppressed, especially in later chapters, i.e.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If the field or the vector is constant it will be defined as such and
denoted by a subscript, usually zero e.g. @xmath .
Derivatives with regards to contravariant, @xmath , or covariant
vectors, @xmath , are defined as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the properties of the metric tensor ( 2.3 ) have been used.
The time-derivative is sometimes expressed as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

#### 1.2.2 Natural units

In this work the notion of “natural units”, where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

will be adopted. This will be used since some equations are very
cumbersome if all the factors of @xmath and @xmath are included. Where
the inclusion of @xmath or @xmath is of specific interest or meaning
they will still be initially included.
This convention has the added benefit that it establishes a simple
relation between mass and length scale, through the relation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In natural units the relativistic energy-mass relationship,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

reduces to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the units of mass and energy are the same. Table 1.1 contains the
constants and conversion factors (in natural units) used in this work,
that are not explicitly defined elsewhere.

### 1.3 Matrices

The @xmath identity matrix will be denoted by @xmath . If the value of
@xmath is known or specific, it will be denoted by a subscript, i.e. for
@xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath

## Chapter 2 Relativity

Due to the central role that gravity plays in binding neutron stars, any
description of these objects must include the effects of gravity. In
this work gravitational effects will be included by using a description
that is consistent with the special and general theories of relativity.

### 2.1 Introduction

One of Albert Einstein’s phenomenal achievements was to recognise that
mass and energy are related. As such both mass and energy are
gravitational sources and not only mass, as is implied in Newtonian
theory.
Since neutron stars are large, ultra-dense objects with large
gravitational fields and high particle energies, relativistic effects
need to be considered in the description of these objects. The aim of
this chapter is to give a brief introduction of the concepts and the
necessary tools in the general and special theories of relativity that
are applied in the description of neutron stars.

### 2.2 Special theory of relativity

The principle of relativity states that the same mechanical laws apply
in any frame of reference. This principle was already clearly formulated
by Galileo Galilei in the 1600’s for classical mechanics (i.e. mechanics
governed by Newton’s Laws), but Albert Einstein, in the special theory
of relativity, extended this principle to include all physical laws. [
14 ]
The special theory of relativity (commonly referred to as special
relativity) is grounded upon two postulates [ 15 ] :
The postulate of relativity: That the same physical laws apply in any
inertial (uniformly moving) frame of reference.
The speed of light is universal: The speed of light in a vacuum (denoted
by @xmath ) is the same for all inertial observers, regardless of the
motion of the source.
The line element in special relativity, known as the proper time @xmath
, is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

It is the preserved interval that defines Minkowski space. @xmath refers
to a spacetime point and is expressed in Cartesian coordinates as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

From the expression of the line element ( 2.1 ), the metric tensor of
Minkowski space is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

Special relativity does not include any gravitational effects and
therefore spacetime is flat and the metric tensor ( 2.3 ) is fixed.
Frames of reference in which the expressions of special relativity are
valid are called Lorentz (inertial) frames. These frames are related by
Lorentz transformations . Due to the postulate of relativity the
physical expression of any observable should not differ when observed
from different Lorentz frames. Because any two inertial frames of
reference are related by a Lorentz transformation it means that the
equations describing a physical observable must be invariant under
Lorentz transformations. This property is known as covariance and if an
equation is expressed in a covariant manner the form of the equation
does not change when transformed from one Lorentz frame to another. To
be able to write equations in a covariant manner tensor analyses is
used. [ 14 ]

### 2.3 General theory of relativity

The special theory of relativity gives a very accurate description of
our world within a Lorentz frame, but neglects one of the most prominent
forces that govern the large scale behaviour in our universe, namely
gravity. The distinction between gravity and other forces is that
gravity acts on all matter, regardless of their internal structure or
composition: Particles with wholly different physical properties will
follow the same free path in a gravitational field, given only that
their initial velocities are the same. The general theory of relativity
(commonly referred to as simply general relativity) expands the locally
very accurate special theory of relativity to a global scale, by
including gravitational effects. [ 14 ]
Special relativity would unfortunately not suffice if gravitational
effects are included since no global Lorentz frame can be constructed in
a non-uniform gravitational field [ 14 ] . This is because Euclid’s
Parallel Postulate holds in Minkowski space, i.e. in Minkowski space
parallel worldlines stay parallel if extended infinitely. In a
non-uniform gravitational field particles do not travel along straight
lines, but along curved trajectories: if two particles are released from
the same height above the earth’s surface, but some distance apart, they
will both fall towards the centre of the earth. Their trajectories would
be parallel on a local scale but overall they will follow a curved path
[ 4 ] . The spacetime on a global scale and in the presence of
gravitational sources is one in which Euclid’s Parallel Postulate does
not hold, i.e. a spacetime that is flat on a local scale but overall
curved, as described by Riemannian geometry [ 14 ] .
The absence of a global Lorentz frame might spell trouble for special
relativity: if no Lorentz frame with regards to an event can be found,
special relativity will be a very interesting but unphysical theory.
Luckily within a free-falling frame in a non-uniform gravitational field
the effect of the gravitational field would not be noted. Thus a
free-falling frame of reference would constitute a Lorentz frame with
regards to the event. Einstein used this fact to relate the special and
general theories of relativity through the Equivalence Principle:
The Equivalence Principle: Physical laws that describe how the forces of
nature behave in a gravitational field have the same (covariant) form as
in the special theory of relativity when these laws are expressed in a
frame of reference, free-falling with the event, in the gravitational
field.
The Equivalence Principle is analogous to the theorem in differential
geometry that states that a flat space tangent to the manifold can be
imposed on any point in a differentiable manifold. The spacetime of
general relativity constitutes such a manifold and therefore a Lorentz
frame can be imposed at any point. [ 14 ]
To translate from special to general relativity the metric tensor,
@xmath , has to be replaced by the general metric, @xmath , and normal
derivatives by covariant derivates (see Sec. 2.4 for details of @xmath
and covariant differentiation) [ 4 ] .

### 2.4 Riemannian spaces

Albert Einstein recognised the similarities between gravitational
physics and Riemannian spaces and used the mathematics describing these
spaces to describe gravitational phyics.
In this section the main points of Riemannian spaces will be introduced.

#### 2.4.1 Geodesics

A line in curved space is defined as straight (i.e. the shortest
distance between two points) if the tangent vector to the line is
parallel-transported [ 14 ] . These lines are known as geodesics.
The metric tensor of curved space is denoted by @xmath and is defined in
terms of the natural basis vector ( @xmath ) of the space

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is a small displacement along the coordinate curve. The
metric tensor is given by the dot product of two basis vectors

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In Minkowski space the metric tensor ( @xmath ) is fixed and given by (
2.3 ). In curved space the metric tensor is not necessarily constant,
but dependant on the geometry of the space. [ 17 ]
Geodesics, just as straight lines in a Euclidean space, can also be
defined as the extreme value of the integral of the proper time interval
( @xmath ) between the two spacetime points. The line element, the
proper time, in general relativity is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

As is shown by N.K. Glendenning in Ref. [ 4 ] , geodesics are thus
described by the Geodesic equation,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the affine connection. It also shown in Ref. [ 4 ] that
the affine connection is equal to the Christoffel symbol of the second
kind.

#### 2.4.2 Christoffel symbols

The Christoffel symbol (of the second kind), @xmath , is defined in
terms of the relation of the derivative of the natural base vector to
the natural base vectors as [ 17 ] ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

As shown in Ref. [ 16 ] , the Christoffel symbols can be expressed in
terms of the metric tensor

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and so it can be seen that the Christoffel symbols are related to the
curvature of the space through the change in the metric.
The Christoffel symbol of the first kind, @xmath , is related to the
Christoffel symbol of the second kind through [ 4 ] :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The Christoffel symbols of the second kind are symmetric in their
covariant (lower) components [ 17 ] , i.e.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and so the Christoffel symbols of the first kind are symmetric in the
last two covariant components.

#### 2.4.3 Covariant derivatives

The partial derivative of a vector @xmath , with @xmath , is:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

and the covariant derivative is defined as [ 17 ] :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

The covariant derivative transforms covariantly, i.e. the covariant
derivative of a tensor is once again a tensor [ 16 ] .

#### 2.4.4 Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor

The Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor (or just curvature tensor)
describes the curvature of space. It is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

The curvature tensor is derived by evaluating the parallel-transport of
a tangent vector along a small closed loop on a curved surface. The
vector field is defined on the surface and a vector ( @xmath )
parallel-transported along the loop. Once the starting point is reached
again, the vector is compared to the original vector. The difference
between the two vectors is proportional to the curvature and the
curvature tensor [ 14 ] .
A more intuitive explanation might be given when it is considered that
in flat spacetime the metric tensor is constant and the order of
covariant differentiation does not matter. But in curved spacetime the
order of covariant differentiation is important as two successive
covariant differentiations do not commute, as is shown in Ref. [ 14 ] :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the commutator is given by the curvature tensor. The commutator is
analogous to computing the change in a vector along a closed path: the
change in the vector is first computed in one direction and then in
another and the changes in the reverse order is subtracted. [ 14 ]
The curvature tensor is zero if and only if the space is flat [ 16 ] .

#### 2.4.5 Bianchi identities

From the properties of the curvature tensor it is shown in Ref. [ 14 ]
that the following equation holds in any frame:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

This is known as the Bianchi identities . These identities can be used
to determine the metric tensor if the curvature is known [ 16 ] .

#### 2.4.6 Ricci tensor and scalar curvature

The Ricci tensor , @xmath , is a contraction of the curvature tensor:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Ricci tensor can also be formed by contracting indices, other than
the first and the third, but the symmetry of the curvature tensor
implies that these contractions will either vanish or at most add a
minus sign to the Ricci tensor. The Ricci tensor is symmetric. [ 14 ]
The scalar curvature , @xmath , is defined as the contraction of the
metric tensor and the Ricci tensor [ 4 ] :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

#### 2.4.7 Einstein tensor

If the Bianchi identity is contracted twice [ 14 ] :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

then the last equation can be rewritten as:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

By defining @xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

it is clear from Eq. ( 2.11 ) that it has vanishing covariant
divergence, i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

@xmath is known as the Einstein tensor and it plays a fundamental role
in general relativity (see Sec. 2.6 ). From the symmetry of the Ricci
and metric tensors it is clear that the Einstein tensor is also
symmetric.

### 2.5 Energy-momentum tensor

The energy-momentum tensor ( @xmath ) describes the internal properties
of an energy-mass distribution (i.e. matter) and is the source of the
curvature of spacetime. To be able to give an accurate, covariant
description of the internal properties of matter within a relativistic
framework, not only the energy distribution, but also the distribution
of momentum within the matter needs to be considered.
The energy-momentum tensor is defined in terms of the flux of the
4-momentum across a constant surface. The element, @xmath , can be
described as the @xmath -component of the momentum flux across the
@xmath -surface. Thus the following components can be explicitly named:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  @xmath = energy density,
  @xmath = energy flux across the @xmath surface,
  @xmath = @xmath momentum density,
  @xmath = flux of the @xmath momentum across the @xmath surface.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

If we evaluate the energy-momentum tensor in a momentarily comoving
frame of reference all elements of the matter would be momentarily
static (no spatial momentum), but that would not imply that there is no
transfer of energy. Energy might be transferred by heat conduction and
therefore the @xmath terms of the energy-momentum tensor would be
non-zero. The @xmath components would also be non-zero for the energy
that is being transferred will carry momentum. The @xmath components
would be equal to the @xmath components since the energy flux is the
energy density times the speeds at which it flows. In the relativistic
frame, mass is equal to energy so the energy flux is equal to the mass
density times the speeds at which it flows, which is the density of
momentum.
The spatial components of the energy-momentum tensor ( @xmath ) are
symmetric. If they were not it would be imply that the elements are
whirling around inside the fluid, in the momentarily comoving frame of
reference. Thus @xmath is in general symmetric and symmetry of the
tensor in one frame of reference would imply that it is symmetric in all
frames of reference.
The spatial components of the energy-momentum tensor represent the
forces between adjacent elements in the matter: the off-diagonal spatial
elements represent the viscosity (or any other forces that are parallel
to the interface between elements) and the diagonal elements, the normal
forces (i.e. the pressure). [ 14 ]
In general the energy-momentum tensor for static, spherically symmetric
perfect fluid (no viscosity or heat conduction), moving with a velocity
@xmath is [ 4 , 21 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

-   @xmath is the energy density,

-   @xmath is the pressure, and,

-   @xmath is the four-velocity,

      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.15)
                           @xmath   @xmath   
      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

    and therefore @xmath [ 4 ] .

The conservation of mass and energy is expressed in terms of the
energy-momentum tensor by the fact that the energy-momentum tensor has
vanishing divergence, i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

In general relativity Eq. ( 2.16 ) generalises to [ 16 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

### 2.6 Einstein’s field equations

Physical theories are mostly categorised by defining equations, which in
the case of general relativity are the Einstein field equations. The
Einstein field equations are given by solutions of the Einstein tensor.
For spacetime inside a distribution of mass and energy (i.e. a star),
Einstein’s field equations are given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the energy-momentum tensor and @xmath is a constant that
is determined by comparing general relativity to Newtonian mechanics in
the Newtonian limit [ 4 ] . The energy-momentum tensor is a symmetric,
divergenceless tensor that is constructed from the mass-energy
properties of the medium.
The Einstein field equations ( 2.18 ) do not only govern spacetime
within a mass-energy distribution, but also the arrangement of
mass-energy distribution as well as its dynamics. Thus spacetime is
acted upon by a mass-energy distribution, as these are sources of
gravity. On the other hand, spacetime influences the mass-energy
distribution through the curvature of spacetime. Thus spacetime and
matter co-determine the universe within which we live.

## Chapter 3 Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations

By using the concepts defined in Chapter 2 a relativistic description
for a neutron star will be derived in this chapter.

### 3.1 Introduction

As a first approximation a star (such as a neutron star) is assumed to
be a static, spherical symmetric fluid (gas) in hydrostatic equilibrium
[ 4 ] : the star is bound by an external pressure that compresses the
star (gravity) while the star is stabilised against gravitational
collapse by the internal pressure in the star due to some repulsive
force.
If a neutron star is assumed to be a static spherical symmetric fluid in
hydrostatic equilibrium it would have to be described by a relativistic
equation for hydrostatic equilibrium.
This problem was first studied by R. C. Tolman [ 18 ] and by J. R.
Oppenheimer and G. M. Volkoff [ 19 ] in 1939. They derived an equation
to study hydrostatic equilibrium in a relativistic environment by
describing a neutron star assuming that it consists of a neutron gas at
high density [ 7 ] :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

-   @xmath is the enclosed mass of the star,

-   @xmath is the energy density, and

-   @xmath is the internal pressure of the star.

Eq. ( 3.1 ) is known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation [
20 ] .
The TOV equation expresses how the pressure decreases from the centre of
the star to the edge (where @xmath ) in terms of the energy density and
the pressure. These two quantities are related through the equation of
state of the matter in the interior of the star. The larger the star,
the higher the pressure in the centre of the star will be, since it is
gravity that compresses the star. Since the pressure appears on the
right-hand side of Eq. ( 3.1 ), an increase in the central pressure will
increase the pressure gradient [the left-hand side of Eq. ( 3.1 )]. Thus
the more massive the star, the smaller the radius at which @xmath ,
since the pressure gradient is steeper. Thus there exists a critical
value for the mass of the star, above which the star will collapse under
its own gravity [ 4 ] . This critical value is known as the maximum mass
of the star and will differ for different equations of state of the
matter in the neutron star interior.

### 3.2 Derivation of the TOV equation

The following derivation is taken almost entirely from Ref. [ 4 ] . (The
derivation in Ref. [ 4 ] is more elaborate and hints to perform some of
the calculations are also given.)
To derive the TOV equations from the Einstein field equation ( 2.18 ) it
suffices to consider a static, isotropic star. The line element for
static, isotropic spacetime can be given by:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath are functions that need to be determined and
@xmath is the spacetime point described in natural units by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

From the expression for the line element ( 3.3 ) the components of the
metric tensor can be read off as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.4a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.4b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.4c)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.4d)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.4e)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath , @xmath is given by @xmath (no summation over indices).
Using the symmetry properties of the Christoffel symbols, the components
of the Ricci tensor in static isotropic spacetime are:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.5a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.5b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.5c)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.5d)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where the primed index refers to differentiation with respect to @xmath
.
For the construction of the TOV equation it is easier to work with mixed
tensors, therefore the Einstein field equations ( 2.18 ) are written as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.6)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

and thus, using the properties of the Ricci tensor ( 3.5 ), the
components of the Einstein tensor become:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.7a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.7b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.7c)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.7d)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

From ( 2.14 ) and the equivalence principle, the energy-momentum tensor
is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since the the star is static ( @xmath ) and therefore from ( 2.15 ),
@xmath , @xmath is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

From the equivalence principle, a comoving Lorentz frame can be defined
¹ ¹ 1 This is a valid assumption, since the change in the metric from
the centre of the star to its boundary is not significant over the
spacing between a few nucleons [ 4 ] . [The change in the metric can be
estimated by considering the espression for @xmath ( 3.14 ).] , and
therefore the energy-momentum tensor can be expressed as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

From ( 3.7a ), ( 3.6 ) and ( 3.8 )

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.9)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

and ( 3.9 ) can be solved to obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.10)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where @xmath is defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

Eq. ( 3.11 ) is an expression for the gravitational mass i.e. the
mass-energy that generates a gravitational field included, up to radius
@xmath , in the star. The relativistic expression (in natural units)
that is used to describe the relation between the energy density (
@xmath ) and the mass density ( @xmath ) is:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Using ( 3.10 ) the following expression for ( 3.4b ) can be obtained:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

For ( 3.12 ) to agree with Newtonian mechanics in the Newtonian limit,
@xmath should be defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath the Gravitational constant [ 4 ] . Thus ( 3.12 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using ( 3.13 ) and ( 3.8 ) the expression for the Einstein field
equations ( 3.7 ), becomes:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.15a)
     @xmath   @xmath               (3.15b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.15c)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.15d)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

By manipulating ( 3.15a ), ( 3.15b ) and ( 3.14 ) and substituting it
into ( 3.15c ), the following expression for @xmath is obtained:

  -- -- -- --------
           (3.16)
  -- -- -- --------

Eq. ( 3.16 ) is the TOV equation in natural units.

### 3.3 Solving the TOV equation

To obtain sensible information from the TOV equation the coupled
differential equations, Eqs ( 3.1 ) and ( 3.2 ), must be solved. To be
able to do this the initial conditions (at @xmath ) for @xmath and
@xmath must be known.
Since the expression for @xmath ( 3.11 ) refers to the enclosed mass in
the star and @xmath refers to the centre of the star, the initial values
for both @xmath and @xmath are taken to be zero (or very small). The
choice for the initial @xmath depends on the inferred central baryon
density of the neutron star.
Using the initial values for @xmath , @xmath and @xmath the pressure (
@xmath ) at an incremental increase in @xmath , namely @xmath can be
calculated using Eq. ( 3.1 ). Using the equation of state, the
corresponding energy density, @xmath , can be calculated. Using ( 3.2 )
the value for @xmath can be obtained. This cycle is repeated until
@xmath at which the @xmath is zero, is reached. This denotes the
boundary of the star and @xmath is the radius of the star. @xmath is the
mass enclosed by the radius of the star, i.e. the mass of the star.
Each different assumption of the central density will correspond to a
unique mass and radius relationship of the neutron star. Therefore by
varying the initial central density, a whole sequence of possible masses
and radii of neutron stars, corresponding to a specific equation of
state, can be generated.
As was expounded upon at the beginning of this chapter, each neutron
star sequence has a maximum mass and as such each equation of state of
the neutron star interior implies a different maximum mass. The
equations of state with higher maximum masses are referred as stiff,
i.e. the pressure increases rapidly with an increase in density. The
equations of state with lower maximum masses are referred to as softer
equations of state [ 4 ] .

## Chapter 4 Modelling dense nuclear matter

The challenge in the description of matter at high densities, such as
that in neutron stars, is to develop a model that not only describes
matter at high densities, but also the properties of matter observed at
normal densities. Additionally, relativistic effects become much more
pronounced in dense systems as the particles attain energies that are
comparable to their rest mass. Therefore it is neccesary that a
description of matter at high densities must incorporate the general
properties of quantum mechanics, Lorentz covariance, electromagnetic
gauge invariance and microscopic causality within a many-body system [
21 ] . The only framework that can describe a relativistic,
quantum-mechanical, many-body system in such a way is relativistic
quantum field theory based on a local, Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian
density [ 21 , 22 ] .
Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) describes the interaction between quarks
via the exchange of gluons. This fundamental theory is an obvious
candidate to describe dense matter systems, but unfortunately this
theory has computational difficulties at such scales [ 21 ] . It is also
cumbersome to describe nuclear phenomena in terms of quarks and gluons
since quark degrees of freedom are not observed in nuclear experiments
but, hadronic degrees of freedom. Hadrons are particles that consist of
a number of quarks and are further subdivided into baryons and mesons:
baryons are particles that contain three quarks (such as protons and
neutrons), while mesons contain a quark - anti-quark pair. A description
of the interaction between two nucleons (particles in the nucleus),
based on the exchange of mesons was first introduced by Hideki Yukawa in
1935 [ 23 ] and gained much acceptance after the actual discovery of
mesons. A complete discussion of the mesonic theory of the nucleus is
given in Ref. [ 23 ] .
A quantized field theoretical description of nuclei and nuclear matter,
called quantum hadrodynamics (QHD), which is based on hadronic degrees
of freedom was introduced by John Walecka in 1974 [ 24 ] . It should be
noted that QHD is not a fundamental theory, but an effective one since
hadrons are composite particles.
In QHD, as in QCD, one soon runs into computational difficulties and to
obtain solutions from the description certain approximations have to be
made. The coupling constants in QHD are large and thus a perturbation
expansion in terms of the coupling constants will not suffice. Instead
the system can be approximated in the relativistic mean-field. This
approximation will be discussed in Sec. 8.3 . The saturation properties
of nuclei and nuclear matter, that any description of dense matter
should reproduce, are discussed in Section 4.1 . In Chapter 5 a brief
overview of relativistic quantum mechanics is given. This chapter is
followed by a brief discussion of the necessary tools and concepts in
classical field theory that is used in quantum field theory in Chapter 6
. Quantum field theory is discussed in Chapter 7 , after which QHD is
formulated in Chapters 8 and 9 .

### 4.1 Properties of symmetric nuclear matter constraining nuclear
models

Symmetric nuclear matter, or just nuclear matter, is an idealised system
that stems from one of the original models of the nucleus, the
liquid-drop model. The properties of nuclear matter are inferred from
the experimentally observed properties of finite nuclei [ 4 ] , but,
since it cannot be directly observed, there seem to be some disagreement
as to what the exact values of certain properties of nuclear matter are.
In this work the values of the properties of nuclear matter given in
Ref. [ 4 ] will be taken as the observed values.

#### 4.1.1 Saturation density

Nuclear matter is a saturated system, due the characteristics of the
strong interaction. The short-ranged, strong nuclear interaction is the
dominant interaction between nucleons. It is essentially attractive,
which is necessary to form stable nuclei, but repulsive at short
distance ( @xmath fm). Since the strong force acts only over a short
distance, the interaction is limited to nearest neighbours in a dense
system. Therefore at a certain density the central density of the system
will not increase any further, even as more nucleons are added to the
system. The density at which this occurs is referred to as the
saturation density. At saturation density the pressure of the system is
zero and the system will remain in this state if left undisturbed. [ 4 ]
The density of saturated nuclear matter given as 0.153 fm @xmath in Ref.
[ 4 ] and 0.16 fm @xmath in Ref. [ 6 ] .

#### 4.1.2 Binding energy

In general terms the binding energy of a system is the energy expended
or required to form a system. In the case of a stable system the binding
energy is negative, hence energy was donated to the surrounding
environment in forming the system, leaving the system at a lower energy
state than the sum of all the individual parts of the system.
At saturation density the binding energy of the system will be at a
minimum since at this density the system is in its most stable (lowest
energy) state, compared to other densities. The binding energy of
nuclear matter is given as -16.3 MeV/nucleon in Ref. [ 4 ] and -16.0
MeV/nucleon in Ref. [ 6 ]

#### 4.1.3 Symmetry energy

Stable nuclei with low proton ( @xmath ) number prefer a nearly
equivalent neutron ( @xmath ) number. As @xmath increases the
(repulsive) Coulomb interaction between the protons also increases.
Stable nuclei then diverge from being @xmath nuclei to nuclei with a
@xmath larger than @xmath , as can been seen on a Segre diagram. The
influence of this preference is accounted for by the symmetry energy.
The symmetry energy coefficient, @xmath , stems from liquid-drop model
of the nucleus, and refers to the contribution made by the isospin
assymetry to the energy of the nucleus [ 25 ] .
The symmetry energy coefficient is given by:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

The value of @xmath is estimated to be between 31 and 33 MeV according
to Ref. [ 5 ] , while Refs [ 4 ] and [ 6 ] state the value of @xmath to
be 32.5 MeV (without any uncertainty).

#### 4.1.4 Compression modulus

The compression modulus defines the curvature of the equation of state
at saturation [ 4 ] and is related to the high density behaviour of the
equation of state. If the energy density rapidly increases with an
increase in pressure the equation of state is referred to as stiff. With
a soft equation of state the energy density increases more gradually
with an increase in the pressure [ 4 ] .
The compression modulus, @xmath , defined as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

The value of @xmath has been estimated to 234 MeV (with some
uncertainty) [ 4 ] . Ref. [ 6 ] state the value of @xmath to be 265 MeV.

## Chapter 5 Relativistic quantum mechanics

This chapter is a very concise introduction to relativistic quantum
mechanics, introducing only concepts necessary within the scope of this
work. A much more thorough discussion can be found in Refs [ 26 ] to [
30 ] .

### 5.1 Introduction

Relativistic quantum mechanics is the merger of quantum mechanics and
special relativity. One possible candidate for a relativistic quantum
mechanical description could be the Schrödinger equation. The
Schrödinger equation can be motivated by applying the canonical
quantization to the non-relativistic energy-momentum relationship [ 26 ]
,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the physical quantities are replaced by operators, i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
                 
     @xmath      (5.1a)
     @xmath      (5.1b)
  -- -------- -- --------

and by letting the operators operate on the wave function @xmath , the
Schrödinger equation is obtained:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Relativity requires that the equations of motion in one inertial frame
are valid in all inertial frames, meaning that all equations describing
the motion of a particle must transform covariantly under Lorentz
transformations. The Schrödinger equation does not transform covariantly
and therefore another approach is needed to describe relativistic
particles in a quantized theory [ 27 ] . An obvious candidate would be
to apply the canonical quantization to the relativistic mass-energy
relationship.

### 5.2 Klein-Gordon equation

Imposing the canonical quantization procedure to the relativistic
energy-momentum relationship,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

results in the Klein-Gordon equation [ 26 ] :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is some wave function that depends on the four-vector
@xmath .
The Klein-Gordon equation can be expressed in a covariant manner as:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Since

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

transforms like a scalar under Lorentz transformations [ 4 ] , the wave
function, @xmath , has to describe a scalar particle for Eq. ( 5.2 ) to
be a covariant equation. Therefore plane-wave solutions of the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath the momentum four-vector and @xmath , can be solutions of
the free particle Klein-Gordon equation [ 26 ] .
Substituting this wave function into the Klein-Gordon equation ( 5.2 ),
the relativistic energy-momentum relation,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is obtained. As such, the possible energies are:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus the Klein-Gordon equation allows for positive as well as negative
energy solutions.
The Klein-Gordon equation has the conserved current @xmath (i.e. @xmath
), with @xmath , where

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

If the time-like component of the conserved current ( @xmath ) is
interpreted as the probability density, the negative energy solution
would imply that the probability density will not be positive definite [
28 ] .
Historically the possibility of negative energy solutions and the
probability not being positive definite led to the Klein-Gordon equation
being abandoned as a physical description [ 26 ] . However, the
Klein-Gordon equation was redeemed when a physical interpretation was
given to the negative energy solutions (see Sec. 5.4 ).

### 5.3 Dirac equation

P. A. M. Dirac wanted to formulate an equation based on the relativistic
energy-momentum relationship that is linear in spatial and time
derivatives in an effort to overcome the difficulties of the
Klein-Gordon equation, especially the positive definiteness of the
probability density [ 28 ] .
One way to obtain the Dirac equation, using the relativistic
energy-momentum relationship, is by making the following substitution [
29 ] :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath and @xmath need to be determined, but are assumed to be
constants, independent of spacetime and to commute with position and
momentum operators [ 30 ] .
Making the substitutions of the canonical quantization ( 5.1 ), the
above expression reduces to the Dirac-equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

As is discussed in Ref. [ 27 ] the properties of the Dirac equation (
5.4 ) can be derived by considering certain requirements: Since Eq. (
5.4 ) must be invariant under spatial rotations, @xmath and @xmath
cannot simply be numbers. If it is considered that the probability
density, @xmath , must be the time component of a conserved four-vector
if integrated over all space at constant time, Dirac proposed that the
wave function must be analogous to a @xmath -component spin wave
function,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

The column vectors satisfying the Dirac equation are called Dirac
spinors. Therefore @xmath and @xmath must be @xmath matrices. Since the
Dirac equation ( 5.4 ) must satisfy the relativistic energy-momentum
relationship, the following properties can be derived:

  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------
                             
     @xmath      @xmath      (5.6a)
     @xmath      @xmath      (5.6b)
  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------

Since the Hamilton operator, in this case

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

must be hermitian it implies that @xmath and @xmath must also be
hermitian [ 30 ] . Thus @xmath and @xmath both must be traceless, even
dimensional matrices with eigenvalues of @xmath .
For @xmath = 2 the conditions of ( 5.6 ) are satisfied by the
Pauli-matrices and the identity matrix, but not all these matrices are
traceless. Thus the lowest dimensionality that satisfies all conditions
for @xmath and @xmath is @xmath = 4 [ 27 , 28 ] . One representation of
these matrices is known is the Pauli-Dirac representation, given by :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.7a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.7b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.8a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.8b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.8c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

are the Pauli-matrices.
In the non-relativistic limit the Dirac equation reduces to the Pauli
equation describing spin- @xmath [ 27 ] . Thus the free particle
solutions of the Dirac equation can be found in analogy to that of a
non-relativistic spin- @xmath particle, where the wave functions consist
of a two component spinor and a plane-wave function [ 26 ] . A possible
solution to the Dirac equation ( 5.4 ) is [ 26 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath are spacetime and momentum four-vectors and
@xmath is a four component column vector written as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with @xmath and @xmath two component spinors.
Solving for @xmath , Eq. ( 5.4 ) reduces to:

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

thus obtaining coupled equations for @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
                 
     @xmath      (5.10a)
     @xmath      (5.10b)
  -- -------- -- ---------

From Eq. ( 5.10b ), @xmath is given by:

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

When the solution for @xmath [from Eq. ( 5.10b )] is substituted into
Eq. ( 5.10a ), it can be shown that [ 26 ] :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which implies that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

thus allowing positive and negative energy solutions to the Dirac
equation [ 26 ] .
To be able to write the Dirac equation in a covariant form, the @xmath
-matrices are defined as:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.11a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.11b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

The properties of the @xmath -matrices in the Pauli-Dirac representation
are derived from the properties of @xmath and @xmath ( 5.6 ) and that of
the Pauli-spin matrices ( 5.8 ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --

and the adjoints of the @xmath -matrices are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The Dirac equation ( 5.4 ) can be written in a covariant form, by
multiplying it from the left by @xmath , as:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

Eq. ( 5.13 ) will only be covariant under a Lorentz transformation,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

if the wave function, @xmath transforms as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is some matrix [ 28 ] .
As shown in Refs [ 27 ] and [ 28 ] , @xmath must satisfy:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Defining the Dirac adjoint @xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

it is also shown in Ref. [ 27 ] that @xmath transforms under a Lorentz
transformation as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The Dirac equation has a conserved current, @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

of which the time-like component, @xmath , is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

so that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus the probability density of the Dirac equation is positive definite,
but negative energy solutions are still allowed [ 26 ] .

### 5.4 Interpretation of negative energy solutions of the Klein-Gordon
and Dirac equations

There are two interpretations of the negative energy solutions. First P.
A. M. Dirac put forward an interpretation of the negative energy
solution of the Dirac equation for fermions and then R. P. Feynman added
another interpretation that could be applied to fermions as well as
bosons (scalar particles, described by the Klein-Gordon equation) [ 29 ]
.

#### 5.4.1 Dirac’s interpretation

The Dirac description states that there are positive and negative energy
states available to a free spin- @xmath particle, such as an electron.
These energy levels are symmetric around the zero energy state. To
prevent positive energy particles from spontaneously decaying to
negative energy states Dirac postulated that in the vacuum state all the
negative energy states are filled (the Dirac sea [ 26 ] ). Since all
negative energy states are filled, Pauli’s Exclusion Principle prevents
the decay of a positive energy electron to a negative energy state. [ 26
]
An electron occupying a negative energy state can be excited to a
positive energy state, leaving a hole in the Dirac vacuum. Due to the
absence of a negatively charged electron the hole will behave as a
positively charged particle with a positive energy with regards to the
Fermi sea, predicting the existence of a positron [ 26 ] .
It should be noted that due to this interpretation the Dirac equation no
longer describes a single particle state, but a many-particle state,
thus necessitating a many-particle description such as quantum field
theory to describe relativistic particles [ 27 ] .

#### 5.4.2 Feynman’s interpretation

R.P. Feynman interpreted the negative energy state as positive energy
particle propagating backwards in time or as an anti-particle
propagating forward in time [ 29 ] .
The Feynman’s interpretation vindicated the Klein-Gordon equation. Since
the Klein-Gordon equation describes bosons, which do not obey the Pauli
Exclusion Principle, the Dirac interpretation could not be applied to
explain the negative energy solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation.

## Chapter 6 Lagrangian mechanics and field theory

### 6.1 Lagrangian mechanics

H. Goldstein et al. explain Lagrangian mechanics in Ref. [ 31 ] as a
description of a physical system in terms of the degrees of freedom of
the system. Lagrangian mechanics does not contain any new physics, but
is simply an alternative expression of the physical laws governing the
equations of motion of objects. Since the description is in terms of the
degrees of freedom of the system, the formulation is not restricted to
just describing classical particles, but can also describe discrete or
continuous systems in the classical or relativistic regimes. Lagrangian
mechanics is a desirable description since all the information
pertaining to the system is contained in one function: the Lagrangian.
The Lagrangian (L) is defined by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where,

-   @xmath is the kinetic energy of the system and

-   @xmath the potential energy of the system,

and can thus be seen as an expression of the energy of a system. Each
degree of the @xmath degrees of freedom of the system is described by a
generalised coordinate @xmath , with @xmath . The Lagrangian is given in
terms of the generalised independent coordinates and the time-derivates
of these, @xmath and time, @xmath .
The generalised momentum (conjugate momentum) of each generalised
coordinate is @xmath with

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

The evolution of the system is governed by Hamilton’s principle. It
states that the system will evolve over a time interval @xmath in such a
way that the action ( @xmath ) is stationary. The action is the line
integral of the Lagrangian between time @xmath and time @xmath . If the
action is stationary the variation of the action will be equal to zero,
i.e.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The equation of motion of a specific degree of freedom described by the
coordinate, @xmath , is given by the Euler-Lagrange equation [ 31 ] :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The Euler-Lagrange equation follows from the application of Hamilton’s
principle with regards to a specific coordinate [ 31 ] .

### 6.2 Hamiltonian formulation

The Hamiltonian formulation is an alternative way to express Lagrangian
mechanics. The Hamiltonian formulation has found various extension in
physics and is therefore also briefly discussed.
The essential difference between the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian
formulation is that in the former the Lagrangian is expressed in terms
of the generalised coordinates, the time-derivatives of the generalised
coordinates and time itself, ( @xmath ). In the Hamiltonian formulation
a new quantity, the Hamiltonian, @xmath , is defined and expressed in
terms of the generalised coordinates, the conjugate momenta of the
generalised coordinates and time, ( @xmath ). Thus on a mathematical
level, the switch from the Lagrangian to the Hamiltonian formulation can
be seen as a Legendre transformation [ 31 ] .
The Hamiltonian is defined by (with the sum over @xmath implied) [ 31 ,
32 ] :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Anagolous to the interpretation of @xmath , @xmath can be seen as an
expression of the total energy of the system. If @xmath is @xmath and if
the momentum times the speed of each degree of freedom summed over the
whole system is twice the kinetic energy ( @xmath ) of the system,
@xmath is given as @xmath [ 32 ] .

### 6.3 Field theory

In Ref. [ 31 ] a field is defined as set of one or more functions of
space and time. These functions can be used to describe the displacement
and velocity of points in a (continuous) system [ 32 ] . The formalism
of previous section can be applied to describe continuous systems using
fields, by replacing the discrete coordinates, @xmath , by fields,
@xmath . Accordingly the fields @xmath with @xmath , describe the
degrees of freedom of the system.
In general, all the fields described in this work will be in
4-dimensional Minkowski space [see Eq. ( 2.1 ) for the metric of this
space] and thus the fields will depend on spatial and time coordinates,
i.e.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In field theory the Lagrangian would be defined in terms of the
Lagrangian density ( @xmath ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.3)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

The Euler-Lagrange equations can be generalised (see for instance Refs [
31 ] and [ 32 ] ) to directly apply to the Lagrangian density, i.e.

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

For the field @xmath the conjugate momentum of ( 6.1 ) is defined as
@xmath [ 31 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

The Hamiltonian is defined as:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.6)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

and thus the Hamiltonian density @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

### 6.4 Noether’s theorem

Noether’s theorem describes the relation between the invariance of the
Lagrangian density under certain transformations and conserved
quantities (currents).
The transformation could be a coordinate transformation,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

or a field transformation,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

The theorem states that

-   if the space is flat, and,

-   if the coordinate/field transformation is continuous and the
    transformation can be written in terms of the coordinates as

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.10)
      -- -------- -- --------

    and in terms of the fields as

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.11)
      -- -------- -- --------

    where the functions @xmath and @xmath depend on the coordinate/field
    variables and @xmath is an infinitesimal parameter ( @xmath runs
    from @xmath ), and,

-   if the Lagrangian density is form- and scale invariant under these
    transformations,

then the following will hold [ 31 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

so that there are @xmath conserved currents of the form:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Form invariance of the Lagrangian density under a transformation implies
that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

so that the effect of the transformation on the Lagrangian density would
be

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Scale invariance implies that the magnitude of the action integral is
also assumed to be invariant under the transformation, i.e.

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

A proof of Noether’s theorem is given in amongst other Refs [ 31 ] and [
35 ] .

#### 6.4.1 Energy-momentum tensor as conserved quantity

A typical symmetry of the Lagrangian density is translational
invariance. This means that the Lagrangian density describing the system
is independent of the spatial and temporal origin of the system. With
Noether’s theorem one can show that translational invariance imply that
the energy-momentum tensor is a conserved quantity (also see Sec. 2.5 )
[ 4 , 31 , 35 ] .
Consider the following spacetime translation

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where @xmath is an arbitrary constant and @xmath as in ( 6.10 ). Since
the Lagrangian density (and therefore the fields) are translational
invariant, the coordinate change would have no effect on the fields and
@xmath of Eq. ( 6.9 ) would be zero and therefore also @xmath of Eq. (
6.11 ).
From Noether’s theorem ( 6.12 ) it therefore follows that

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Since @xmath is arbitrary, it follows that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and so the energy-momentum tensor, @xmath , is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.13)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

In Chapters 8 and 9 the fields, @xmath , that will be considered will
actually be field operators. Therefore the (ground state) expectation
value have to be taken [ 21 ] :

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

if a static, spherical symmetric fluid, moving with velocity is consider
[from Eq. ( 2.14 )]. If @xmath , then

  -- -------- -- ---------
                 
     @xmath      (6.14a)
     @xmath      (6.14b)
  -- -------- -- ---------

## Chapter 7 Quantum field theory

Quantum field theory is the application of quantum mechanics to fields.
One of the main motivations for this description is the single particle
description of the very small scales (quantum mechanical) at high
(relativistic) energies gives rise to negative energies, which in the
interpretation of Sec. 5.4 gives rise to many-body states.
Thus to describe this problem in terms of fields has some distinct
advantages. The first being that field theory is a many-body description
in which various degrees of freedom are handled with ease. The
Lagrangian density is a Lorentz scalar and therefore invariant under any
Lorentz boosts or rotations. Since the extreme value of the action is
therefore also invariant, the Euler-Lagrange equation gives rise to
Lorentz invariant equations of motion of the fields contained in the
Lagrangian. A many-particle theory is also necessary in order to
preserve causality as is shown in Ref. [ 33 ] .
The quantization procedure is very similar to that of normal quantum
mechanics, except that in this case it is not the particles that are
quantized, but fields describing the particles.

### 7.1 Quantization of a field

For the quantization of the fields, @xmath , the field and the conjugate
fields, @xmath , are promoted to field operators, i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
                 
     @xmath      (7.1a)
     @xmath      (7.1b)
  -- -------- -- --------

These operators are Heisenberg operators and the following equal-time
commutation relationship are imposed [ 34 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
                 
     @xmath      (7.2a)
     @xmath      (7.2b)
  -- -------- -- --------

These commutation relations are imposed to ensure that the correct spin
statistics are satisfied [ 33 ] .
Since the field operators are time-dependent their dynamics are
determined by Heisenberg’s equation of motion [ 35 ] . Heisenberg’s
equation of motion states that for an operator @xmath the time-evolution
of the operator is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the Hamiltonian ( 6.6 ).
The field operators are defined in the space defined by the state
vectors of the particles described by the field. To obtain an explicit
expression of these operators they are Fourier decomposed in terms of a
complete set of wave functions in the space [ 35 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
                 
     @xmath      (7.4a)
     @xmath      (7.4b)
  -- -------- -- --------

The operator properties and the time-dependence of @xmath are carried by
the expansion coefficients, @xmath [ 35 ] .

### 7.2 Relativistic Scalar fields

From Chapter 5 , relativistic, spin-0 (scalar) particles are described
by the Klein-Gordon equation. The Lagrangian density that describes a
real scalar field, @xmath , with particles of mass @xmath , is (in
natural units) [ 35 ] :

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The equation of motion of the field is derived by applying the
Euler-Lagrange equation ( 6.4 ), and is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

The conjugate field to @xmath is defined analogous to the conjugate
momentum of a classical field ( 6.5 ) by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the Hamiltonian density ( 6.7 ) is

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

#### 7.2.1 Quantization

In canonical field quantization the following substitutions are made

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the operators have to satisfy the following equal-time commutation
relationships :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.7a)
     @xmath   @xmath               (7.7b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

It is shown in Ref. [ 35 ] that the scalar field has to satisfy the
above commutation relations, otherwise the principle of microcausality
will be violated.
The Hamiltonian of the quantized field is simply found to be [ 35 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.8)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

#### 7.2.2 Expansion of operators

The equation of motion of @xmath follows from Heisenberg’s equation (
7.3 ) (keeping in mind that @xmath ),

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is just the free Klein-Gordon equation ( 5.2 ). Expanding the
operator in terms of the plane wave basis for the operator space, the
wave function in Fourier decomposition of the operator ( 7.4 ) becomes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is just a normalisation constant. Thus @xmath can be
written as [ 35 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

Substituting the above equation back into Eq. ( 7.9 ), it is found, as
shown in Ref. [ 35 ] , that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which means that solutions for @xmath are given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and @xmath and @xmath are constants in time [ 35 ] . Since the original
@xmath was a real-valued classical function, the operator should be
hermitian ( @xmath ), and therefore one of the operators can be
expressed in terms of the other as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus the free particle solution for the quantized scalar field ( 7.10 )
becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the conjugate field operator, @xmath , as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

As is shown in Ref. [ 35 ] , by substituting the expressions for the
field operator ( 7.12 ) and the conjugate field operator ( 7.13 ) back
into the commutation relations ( 7.7 ) the commutation relations for
@xmath and @xmath can be obtained and are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.14a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.14b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

Thus @xmath and @xmath satisfy the commutation relationship for creation
and annihilation operators for scalar particles (bosons) [ 33 ] . Scalar
particles are described by symmetric states. The states that the field
operators will operate on are clearly symmetric from the above
commutation relationships, since for an arbitrary state @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The Hamiltonian is constructed from Eq. ( 7.8 ), by replacing the field
operators by their expansions [Eqs ( 7.12 ) and ( 7.13 )]. After some
algebra (as is shown in Ref. [ 35 ] ) the Hamiltonian is expressed as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.15)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

If the above Hamiltonian operates on any state, even the vacuum, it will
have infinite energy, due to the contribution of the last term in Eq. (
7.15 ). This contribution is attributed to the filled negative energy
states that defines the vacuum [ 35 ] . To remove this constant
contribution, Hamiltonian is defined to contain the normal-ordered
product of the operators. Normal-ordering entails that all creation
operators have to stand on the left and all the annihilation operators
on the right [when operators are switched around the commutation
relationships ( 7.14 ) have to be taken into account]. The Hamiltonian,
as the normal-ordered product of the field operators, is:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

### 7.3 Dirac fields

To describe a field of Dirac (spin- @xmath ) particles the ansatz is
that the Lagrangian density for the field is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath and the conjugate field @xmath [see ( 7.17 )] are classical
fields describing the Dirac particles with mass @xmath . This Lagrangian
density can be written covariantly using the definition of the @xmath
-matrices ( 5.11 ) as well as the Dirac adjoint ( 5.14 ), as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Again the equation of motion can be derived using the Euler-Lagrange
equation ( 6.4 ) and is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

The conjugate field is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the Hamiltonian density is

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

#### 7.3.1 Quantization

The Dirac-fields are quantized by replacing the Dirac-spinors by field
operators,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the field operators satisfy the following equal-time
anticommutation relationships ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.18a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.18b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

In contrast to the quantization of the scalar field, the anticommutation
relationships of the Dirac field operators are defined so that
Fermi-Dirac statistics is obeyed [ 35 ] .

#### 7.3.2 Expansion of operators

As is shown in Ref. [ 35 ] the quantized field operator satisfies the
equation for the Dirac field ( 7.16 )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

when expressed in a covariant manner.
The operator for the Dirac field can be expanded in terms of the
solutions to the free Dirac equation ( 5.9 ). These solutions can be
explicitly written (from Ref. [ 35 ] ) as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath runs for 1 to 4. @xmath denotes the positive energy
solutions ( @xmath ) and while the other two values denote the negative
energy solutions ( @xmath ). Thus @xmath for @xmath and @xmath for
@xmath . @xmath are the Dirac spinors and from Ref. [ 35 ] they have the
following orthogonality and completeness properties:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.21a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.21b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.21c)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.21d)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

The expansion of the field operator is thus given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.22)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

and that of the conjugate field operator by [ 35 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.23)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

It can be shown (as in Ref. [ 35 ] ) that the operators @xmath and
@xmath satisfy the same anticommutation relationships imposed on the
field operators ( 7.18 ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

These anticommutation relationships describe anti-symmetric states which
are occupied by fermions (spin- @xmath particles) [ 33 ] , since for an
arbitrary state @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The Hamiltonian of a quantized Dirac field is given by [ 35 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

This Hamiltonian can have an infinite (negative) value, for the last
term adds the contribution of all the negative energy states ( @xmath ).
In the Dirac interpretation of the negative energy states these states
are all filled to form the vacuum. The only contribution of the negative
energy states that should be considered is if an negative energy
particle has been excited to a positive energy state, leaving a hole in
the vacuum. To have a sensible interpretation of the Hamiltonian the
contribution of the vacuum has to be removed, i.e.

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.25)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

For Eq. ( 7.25 ) to be expressed as a product of normal-ordered
operators, @xmath with ( @xmath ) are the annihilation operators for
particles and @xmath with ( @xmath ) are the annihilation operators for
antiparticles (holes). Similarly @xmath with ( @xmath ) are the creation
operators for particles and @xmath with ( @xmath ) are the creation
operators for antiparticles. To more easily distinguish between
operators for particles and antiparticles, the spinors are renamed as:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

and the operators as:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where @xmath denotes the spin projections. The expression for the field
operators therefore changes to (from Ref. [ 35 ] )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

### 7.4 Vector boson fields

Vector bosons are spin-1 particles and the commonly known ones are the
massless photon and the massive @xmath and @xmath bosons [ 35 ] . The
@xmath - and @xmath -mesons are also spin-1 particles [ 21 ] .
The quantization of the fields describing the massive @xmath - and
@xmath -mesons are of particular interest in this work, since these
mesons are included in the description of nuclear matter studied in
Chapters 8 and 9 . The quantization of massive vector boson is to a
large extent based on the quantization of the photon, a massless vector
boson, and therefore the quantization of the photon field will be
discussed first.
As is explained by Greiner et al. in Ref. [ 35 ] the vector boson fields
seem to be overdetermined since one would usually expect four degrees of
freedom to be associated with a vector field (that of a scalar
component, longitudinal and two transversal polarization directions).
Photons, being massless, have only two observed degrees of freedom (two
transversal polarization states), while massive vector bosons
additionally also have a longitudinal polarization state. This reduction
of the degrees of freedom has to be taken into account when quantizing
the theory by imposing additional constraints on the field operators [
35 ] .

#### 7.4.1 Photon field

The electromagnetic interaction between particles via the exchange of
photons is described by Maxwell’s equations. (For a complete description
of the electromagnetic interaction see for instance Introduction to
Electrodynamics by D. J. Griffiths [ 15 ] .) Maxwell’s equations can be
expressed in a covariant manner by defining the field-strength tensor
(or field tensor), @xmath ,

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

as

  -- -------- -- ---------
                 
     @xmath      (7.28a)
     @xmath      (7.28b)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the electromagnetic four-current density.
In terms of the electromagnetic vector potential, @xmath , the field
tensor can be expressed as [ 35 ]

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Eq. ( 7.28a ) then leads to a second-order wave equation and field
equation for @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

from which it can be seen (by taking the four-divergence) that the
electromagnetic current is conserved, i.e. @xmath .
Since the addition of any scalar function @xmath to @xmath in the form
of

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

leaves @xmath invariant and thus also the field equation ( 7.29 ). Since
Eq. ( 7.30 ) describes a local gauge transformation, @xmath is therefore
gauge invariant [ 35 ] .
The property of gauge invariance leads to technical complications in the
theory [ 35 ] and an additional constraint (“gauge”) needs to be imposed
on the field to remedy the situation (in this case by reducing the
degrees of freedom of the field) [ 34 ] . There are various different
conditions that can be imposed on the photon field, one of which is the
Lorenz condition,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

By demanding that the Lorenz condition is satisfied, is known as the
Lorenz gauge. (This condition is mostly misattributed to H. A. Lorentz [
36 ] .)
The photon field equation ( 7.29 ) can be derived from the following
Lagrangian density [ 34 ] ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the conjugate field to the photon field is therefore

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 7.4.2 Quantization

The photon field is quantized by considering the field and the conjugate
field as field operators and imposing the equal-time commutation
relationships [ 35 ]

  -- -------- -- ---------
                 
     @xmath      (7.33a)
     @xmath      (7.33b)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the metric as defined in ( 2.3 ).
Using the expression for the conjugate photon field ( 7.32 ), Eq. (
7.33a ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

The commutator of the divergence of the field operator, @xmath , and the
field operator can be evaluated, using Eqs ( 7.33 ) and ( 7.34 ), and
yields

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

From the above it can be seen that @xmath and thus the canonical
quantization procedure and the Lorenz gauge are not compatible [ 35 ] .
If the Lorenz gauge is not imposed “scalar” photons can be created that
arbitrarily add energy to the system. Since only transversal photons are
observed, another constraint has to be imposed to be able to quantize
the photon field. In the Gupta-Bleuler method only the state vectors in
the Hilbert space, @xmath , that satisfy

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

are admitted. By imposing condition ( 7.35 ) on the states in the
Hilbert space the photon field can be quantized by demanding that the
photon field operators satisfy the conditions given in ( 7.33 ). [ 35 ]

#### 7.4.3 Massive vector bosons

A massive neutral vector bosons (spin-1) field, @xmath , is described by
the Lagrangian density [ 35 ] ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is once again the field tensor,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and @xmath the current density.
Using the Euler-Lagrange equation ( 6.4 ), the equation of motion of the
field is calculated to be

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is the Proca equation [ 34 ] .
By taking the four-divergence of the Proca equation, one finds that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If one assumes that there are no sources, i.e. @xmath , or that the
source current is conserved, i.e. @xmath , the above condition on the
field reduces to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which is the Lorenz condition ( 7.31 ). Thus the Proca equation for
massive vector bosons automatically satisfies the Lorenz condition under
the assumptions mentioned and simplifies to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

The conjugate field ( 7.6 ) is derived from the Lagrangian density (
7.36 ) as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath has no diagonal elements, @xmath would be zero and @xmath .
Because the Proca equation automatically satisfies the Lorenz condition
the time-component of the conjugate field is a dependent variable. This
is to be excepted since by automatically satisfying the Lorenz condition
the Proca equation only has three degrees of freedom [ 35 ] . As a
dependent variable the time-component of field is given in terms of the
degrees of freedom ( @xmath ) as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 7.4.4 Quantization

The canonical quantization of the massive vector field is achieved by
imposing the following commutation relationships:

  -- -------- -- ---------
                 
     @xmath      (7.41a)
     @xmath      (7.41b)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It may seem that the quantization of the field might not be covariant,
since it is only expressed in terms of the spatial components of the
field operators. According to W. Greiner et al. a covariant quantization
can be achieved by defining the time component of the field operator to
be [ 35 ] :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

From ( 7.41 ) this operator satifies the following commutation
relationships

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --

## Chapter 8 Quantum hadrodynamics

### 8.1 Introduction

As mentioned in Chapter 4 , J. D. Walecka introduced a description of
nuclei and nuclear matter based on the exchange of mesons in 1974. This
description will be referred to as quantum hadrodynamics or QHD.
Since nuclei and nuclear matter are complex systems, there exist various
models of nuclei and nuclear matter of which QHD is one. All models need
some form of experimental input to constrain the model. In the case of
QHD it is the coupling constants (or coupling strengths) between the
different meson and nucleon fields that are the unknown parameters.
These couplings are determined by fitting the calculated properties of
nuclei and nuclear matter (such as the properties that were described in
Sec. 4.1 ) to the experimentally observed (or inferred) values. In the
last few decades various other parameter sets for QHD have been
calculated by different authors by fitting various other observed
properties of nuclei and/or nuclear matter. These different parameter
sets differ amongst one another since they might include other meson
fields and/or different couplings between the various fields and/or
recalculated values of the couplings constants.
In Sec. 8.2 the basic philosophy and calculations will be introduced
within the context of the original parameter set, QHD-I, as introduced
by J. D. Walecka [ 24 , 21 ] .
In Chapter 9 other parameter sets and variations based on QHD-I will be
discussed.

### 8.2 Formalism

Quantum hadrodynamics I (QHD-I), also known as the @xmath - @xmath
model, is the original and simplest parameter set of QHD. It models the
nuclear force by the exchange of neutral (isoscalar) scalar sigma (
@xmath ) mesons and neutral (isoscalar) vector omega ( @xmath ) mesons.
These mesons have been found to be the most important in describing the
properties of nuclei and nuclear matter [ 25 ] . The baryons included in
QHD-1 are protons and neutrons. The scalar meson gives rise to a strong
attractive central force and a spin-orbit force in the nucleon-nucleon
interaction, while the vector meson gives rise to a strong repulsive
central force and a spin-orbit force (with the same sign as the
spin-orbit force of the scalar meson) [ 23 ] . Thus the nucleon-nucleon
interaction is described by three fields, the baryon-, scalar meson- and
vector meson-fields. No charged mesons are included in this parameter
set (i.e. the electric properties of the baryons are not considered) and
the masses of the proton and neutron are taken to be equal in QHD-I.
The Lagrangian density of QHD-I (in natural units) is given by [ 21 ] :

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where

-   @xmath denotes the vector meson field,

-   @xmath denotes the scalar meson field,

-   @xmath and @xmath the different meson masses and @xmath denotes the
    nucleon mass,

-   @xmath and @xmath are the vector and scalar coupling constants and

-   @xmath .

The Lagrangian density is a Lorentz scalar and has the dimension of
length @xmath .
In constructing the Lagrangian density it was assumed that the neutral
scalar mesons couple to the scalar density of the baryon field and that
the neutral vector mesons couple to the conserved baryon current [ 21 ]
.
Using the Euler-Lagrange equation ( 6.4 ) the equations of motion of the
different fields can be derived:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.1a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.1b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.1c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Eq. ( 8.1a ) is analogous to the equation of motion of the free scalar
field, the Klein-Gordon equation ( 7.5 ), with the baryon scalar
density, @xmath , as the source term.
Eq. ( 8.1b ) is analogous to the Proca equation ( 7.38 ), with the
coupling of the vector field to the conserved baryon current as the
source term.
The equation of motion of the baryon field is the Dirac equation ( 7.16
) with modified mass (due to the scalar field) and interaction with the
vector field introduced in a minimal fashion [ 21 ] .
Since the equations of motion ( 8.1 ) are non-linear, coupled equations
they are very difficult to solve and are therefore approximated. The
approximation that will be used is the relativistic mean-field
approximation .

### 8.3 Relativistic mean-field theory

In other quantized theories, such as QCD, a perturbation expansion in
the coupling strengths can be used to approximate complicated equations.
Within the framework of QHD the coupling strengths are large and thus
the higher-order terms in a perturbative approximation will diverge.
Within the context of the study of dense nuclear systems an
approximation that is increasingly valid as the density increases, is
also preferred. In the relativistic mean-field approximation (RMF)
within QHD, the meson field operators are replaced by their ground state
( @xmath ) expectation values, which are classical fields, in the
following way [ 21 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
                 
                 (8.2a)
     @xmath      (8.2b)
  -- -------- -- --------

The mean-field approximation ( 8.2 ) can be motivated if a system of
@xmath baryons (which are at rest and at zero temperature), occupying a
box of volume @xmath is considered. Since the system is static, the
baryon flux, given by @xmath , will be zero [ 22 ] . If the baryon
density, @xmath , is increased the source terms on the right-hand side
of Eqs ( 8.1a ) and ( 8.1b ) will become large. If the source terms are
large enough the meson field operators can be approximated by their
ground state expectation values, instead of evaluating the operators at
every spacetime point in the box. For a stationary, uniform system
@xmath and @xmath will be constants, independent of space and time. The
spatial components of @xmath will vanish, since, as mentioned above, the
baryon flux is zero and the system is at rest. Another illustration for
the vanishing spatial components of @xmath is given in Ref. [ 4 ] .
In the mean-field approximation the meson field operators are replaced
by their ground state expectation values in order to simply the solution
to the field equations. However, the nucleon field operators remain
operators. Since only the ground state expectation values of the meson
field operators are considered in the approximation it follows that the
baryon operators (the baryon sources to which the meson fields couple)
must be evaluated by operating on the ground state. As such these baryon
operators in the equations of motion of the meson fields ( 8.1 ) are
replaced by their normal-ordered ground state expectation values [ 37 ]
:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.3a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.3b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where the spatial components vanished due to the consideration of the
ground state. The normal-ordered expectation value is taken since the
contribution of the filled negative energy baryon states (the vacuum) is
ignored, since the vacuum has a (infinite!) constant energy. Thus only
the positive energy baryon states are considered. This is known as the
no-sea approximation [ 42 ] .
Since @xmath and @xmath are constants in the RMF approximation the
equations of motion of the fields ( 8.1 ) reduce to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.4a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.4b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.4c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The RMF QHD-I Lagrangian density is:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

From the above Lagrangian density the RMF energy-momentum tensor of
QHD-I can be constructed using the definition of the energy-momentum
tensor ( 6.13 ) as well as keeping Eq. ( 8.1c ) in mind, and is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The energy density and the pressure, using ( 6.14 ) for QHD-1 is [ 21 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
                                         
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.5a)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.5b)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

### 8.4 Evaluation of expectation values

Since @xmath and @xmath (the baryon field operators) are still
operators, their expectation values have to be calculated to obtain
sensible information for, amongst others, the energy density and the
pressure. As mentioned previously, it is the ground state expectation
values of the baryon field operators that have to be evaluated.
These expectation values can be evaluated by constructing an explicit
expression for @xmath . For the RMF approximation a uniform static
system is assumed, so @xmath is expanded in terms of the momentum
eigenstates [ 21 ] . The momentum eigenstates are denoted by @xmath ,
which is the wave vector. The wave vector is related to the momentum (
@xmath ) through the expression of the de Broglie wavelength [ 38 ] ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In natural units the momentum and the wave vector are equivalent.
Solutions for the field operator are thus of the form [analogous to the
free single-particle solution for a Dirac particle ( 7.20 )],

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the four component Dirac spinor ( @xmath denotes the
spin index) and @xmath the energy associated with specific state denote
by @xmath [ 21 ] . Substituting Eq. ( 8.6 ) into Eq. ( 8.4c ) yields

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By multiplying the above equation by @xmath , it reduces to (having
reverted back to the notation of the @xmath - and @xmath -matrices)

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

-   @xmath is the reduced nucleon mass, defined as

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (8.8)
      -- -------- -- -------

The presence of the scalar meson field thus shifts the mass of the
nucleons [ 21 ] .
Squaring both sides and keeping the properties of the @xmath - and
@xmath -matrices ( 5.6 ) in mind one finds that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

From Eq. ( 8.9 ) is it clear that positive and negative energy
solutions, which are symmetric around @xmath , are still found. Defining
positive and negative energy spinors @xmath and @xmath that in general
satisfy the same orthogonality and completeness properties as in ( 7.21
), as well as the following normalisation condition [ 21 ]

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

the general solution for the baryon field operator ( 8.4c ) can be
written as [ 21 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the particle and anti-particle creation and annihilation have been
included (using the same notation as in Sec. 7.3 ).
The ground state @xmath is defined by @xmath , called the
Fermi-wavenumber: @xmath denotes the filled positive energy baryon
momentum state below which all positive energy states are also filled.
The ground state in the the no-sea approximation has the following
properties:

  -- -------- -- -------- --
     @xmath      @xmath   
     @xmath      @xmath   
     @xmath      @xmath   
  -- -------- -- -------- --

The expectation value in the expression for the RMF value of @xmath (
8.4b ) can be evaluated by using the construction of @xmath ( 8.10 ) and
taking the normal-ordered expectation value, as in Eq. ( 8.3 ). In
normal-ordering the expression the following should be kept in mind: The
anti-commutation relationship of @xmath and @xmath , which is the same
as the creation and annihilation operators of the general Dirac field
given in Sec. 7.3 , as well as the properties of the ground state. Then
it can be shown that, after some algebra, @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.11)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where @xmath is the nucleon spin-degeneracy of the state. From ( 8.11 )
it is clear that @xmath is the nucleon (baryon) number density at @xmath
, which will be denoted by @xmath .
From ( 8.5 ) the expressions for the energy density and the pressure for
QHD-1 in the RMF approximation become

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.12a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.12b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

The expectation values in ( 8.12 ) can be evaluated in the same way as
the one in Eq. ( 8.11 ). After some algebra [using in particular the
properties of the spinors ( 8.7 ) as well as Eq. ( 8.9 )], the
expectation values in the expressions for the energy density and the
pressure reduce to:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.13a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.13b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

The remaining expectation value, that of @xmath in the equation of
motion of the scalar meson field ( 8.4a ), can be evaluated in this
explicit manner, but was not done in this work. Rather other
considerations (as explained in Ref. [ 21 ] ) will be employed to yield
the expectation value (see below and Sec. 8.6 ).
Another method to evaluate the expectation values is given by N. K.
Glendenning in Ref. [ 4 ] . It states that the expectation value of an
operator ( @xmath ) in the ground state can be given in terms of the
expectation value of the single-particle state,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where

-   @xmath denotes the momentum, and,

-   @xmath the spin of the single-particle state.

The expectation value in the many-nucleon system is then [ 4 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

-   @xmath is the positive single-particle energies ( 8.9 ), since only
    the ground state is considered,

-   @xmath is the chemical potential/Fermi energy ( single-particle
    energy @xmath ) , and ,

-   @xmath is a step function with

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

All the possibilities for @xmath will in general appear in the Dirac
Hamiltonian [ 4 ] . The Dirac Hamiltonian @xmath can be constructed from
the equation of motion of the nucleon field ( 8.4c ) and the expression
of @xmath ( 8.6 ) as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

Taking the single-particle expectation value of @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.16)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where @xmath (this can be seen from the expression for @xmath and the
normalisation of the spinors). Taking the derivative of the left-hand
side of Eq. ( 8.16 ) with respect to any variable, @xmath , yields

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.17)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

as @xmath is an eigenfunction of @xmath , the second term on the right
vanishes [ 4 ] . Thus Eq. ( 8.17 ) [considering Eq. ( 8.16 )] yields

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.18)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Any expectation value can therefore be obtained by using the general
expression ( 8.14 ): taking the derivative of @xmath for the appropriate
choice of @xmath to yield @xmath and obtaining the expression for the
single particle expectation value of @xmath from Eq. ( 8.18 ).
Using this method the same results are obtained as with the first
method, just with much less effort. The expectation value in the
expression for the energy density ( 8.12a ), when @xmath operated on
@xmath ( 8.6 ), using Eqs ( 8.7 ) and ( 8.9 ), is:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

and using the value of the single-particle expectation value of @xmath (
8.16 ), the expectation value in the energy density yields

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath            
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The expectation value in the expression for the pressure ( 8.12b ) is

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath            
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

and the single-particle expectation value of the operator @xmath is

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

and using the general expression for the expectation value ( 8.14 )

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.19)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

A result for @xmath can also be obtained in this manner: taking @xmath
(the nucleon mass) as @xmath , the single-particle expectation value is

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Using the general expression for the expectation value ( 8.14 ) and the
above result, @xmath yields

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.20)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

### 8.5 QHD-I parameter set

The values of the particle masses used in this work for QHD-1 was taken
from Ref. [ 22 ] and are listed in Table 8.1 .

The values for the coupling constants used in this work for QHD-1 were
taken from Ref. [ 22 ] (these values are preferred to those given in
Ref. [ 21 ] , as those in Ref. [ 22 ] give a better description of the
saturation properties of nuclear matter). The couplings constants are
given in terms of @xmath and @xmath , which are defined as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In Table 8.2 the values for @xmath and @xmath and the corresponding
values for @xmath and @xmath , using the values of the particle masses
in Table 8.1 , are given.

### 8.6 Equation of state

Using the results for the expectation values obtained in Sec. 8.4 , the
RMF equations of motion for the fields ( 8.4 ) reduce to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.21a)
     @xmath   @xmath               (8.21b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

while the energy density and pressure, from ( 8.5 ) and using Eq. (
8.21b ) to simplify the expression for the energy density, are

  -- -------- -- ---------
                 
     @xmath      (8.22a)
     @xmath      (8.22b)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The expression for @xmath could have also been obtained from the
thermodynamic argument that a closed, isolated system such as the one
assumed for the RMF approximation will minimise its energy. Therefore an
expression for @xmath (and therefore @xmath ) can be obtained by
minimising the energy density ( 8.22a ) with regards to @xmath . In this
way the expression for @xmath is obtained,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is equivalent to Eq. ( 8.21a ) when the definition for @xmath (
8.8 ) is considered.
Imposing spherical symmetry, the energy density ( 8.22a ) and the
pressure ( 8.22b ) can be re-written as:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.24a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.24b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

### 8.7 Observables of nuclear matter in QHD-I

#### 8.7.1 Symmetry energy

To calculate the symmetry coefficient, @xmath , given by ( 4.1 )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

the energy density must be expressed in terms of @xmath . This can be
done by considering the expressions for the proton ( @xmath ), neutron (
@xmath ) and baryon ( @xmath ) number densities. These are given in
terms of the different fermi momenta ( @xmath for the protons and @xmath
for the neutrons) of the species as

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

In the case of symmetric nuclear matter ( @xmath ) the proton and
neutron fermi momenta are equal, @xmath = @xmath = @xmath , and the
baryon density reduces to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

The only terms in the energy density ( 8.24a ) that will contribute to
@xmath are the integrals over the filled baryon states. By defining
@xmath as the isospin dependent part of the energy density, which is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the nucleon degeneracy, @xmath , has been explicitly included (as
2 for each baryon), the expression for @xmath ( 4.1 ) reduces to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.26)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

To evaluate the expression for @xmath the proton and neutron fermi
momenta are expressed in terms of @xmath , i.e.

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.27)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

and

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.28)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

After substituting in the expressions for the different fermi momenta [(
8.27 ) and ( 8.28 )] into the expression for @xmath , as well as some
algebra and remembering that @xmath and @xmath are equivalent at the
evaluation point, ( 8.26 ) yields

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

### 8.8 Summary

The aim of this chapter was to introduce the basic concepts of QHD and
RMF within the context of the QHD-I parameter set. This chapter will
serve as the foundation for the derivation of the equation of state of
nuclear and neutron star matter in other, more advanced QHD parameter
sets. These parameter sets will be discussed in the next chapter.

## Chapter 9 Advanced QHD parameter sets

### 9.1 Introduction

The coupling constants of QHD-I were fitted to reproduce the saturation
of nuclear matter at a fermi wavenumber of 1.30 fm @xmath and binding
energy of -15.75 MeV [ 22 ] . Unfortunately this parameterisation
produces too high a value of the nuclear matter compressibility ( @xmath
). In 1977 J. Boguta and A. R. Bodmer proposed that self-couplings of
the scalar meson field should be included in the Lagrangian density and
the coupling constants re-adjusted to reproduce @xmath more accurately [
39 ] . These self-couplings of the scalar meson field are included in
all other QHD parameter sets studied in this work.
Another addition is the inclusion of the charged (isovector) vector rho
meson triplet ( @xmath , @xmath ) in all parameter sets discussed below.
Since protons and neutrons practically only differ in terms of their
isospin projections, the rho mesons are included to distinguish between
these baryons and to give a better account of the symmetry energy [ 4 ]
. (As these vector meson are charged, the reaction between a rho meson
and a proton will differ from the reaction between a rho meson and a
neutron.)
The rho mesons are introduced in a similar fashion as the other mesons
in QHD: the free Lagrangian density describing the vector field is
included in the QHD Lagrangian density as well as a coupling between the
rho meson and the conserved isospin density [ 4 , 21 ] .
The NL-SH parameter set is “an expansion of the ideas of Boguta and
Bodmer” [ 40 ] and was formulated to reproduce the neutron radii of
neutron-rich nuclei more accurately. This was to be achieved by fitting
the coupling constants to reproduce the experimentally observed values
of the root-mean-square neutron radii of neutron-rich nuclei [ 40 ] .
In 1994 Y. Sugahara and H. Toki introduced a self-coupling in the omega
meson field to the Lagrangian density and formulated the TM1 and TM2
parameter sets. This was done to obtain better agreement with other
models for nuclei and nuclear matter. The parameters were fitted to
obtain agreement with the observed properties of unstable nuclei [ 41 ]
. The TM1 parameter set is obtained when the fitting procedure is done
to obtain agreement with light unstable nuclei and the TM2 parameter set
for heavy unstable nuclei.
According to Ref. [ 42 ] the NL3 parameter set was formulated by G. A.
Lalazissis et al. to (amongst others) further improve the predicted
value of the compressibility, @xmath . The NL3 parameter set is based on
the QHD-I Lagrangian density with the inclusion of rho mesons and
self-couplings of the scalar field. This parameter set aimed to achieve
a better description of nuclei with large isospin asymmetry, i.e. nuclei
far from the valley of beta stability. The parameters were calculated by
fitting the predicted values of various properties (such as binding
energies, charge radii, and neutron radii of spherical nuclei) to the
observed values of nuclei that has a large isospin asymmetry [ 42 ] .
As a further refinement to the TM1 parameter set, the PK1 parameter set
was obtained by fitting properties (such as binding energies and charge
radii) of a wide range of heavy nuclei. This was done to, amongst
others, better reproduce the nuclear symmetry energy and compressibility
[ 43 ] .
B. Todd-Rutel and J. Piekarewicz introduced a coupling between the omega
meson field and the rho meson field in an attempt to better describe the
density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy without changing the
saturation properties of nuclear matter [ 44 ] . The FSUGold parameter
set was obtained by fitting the binding energies and charge radii of a
variety of magic nuclei to the calculated properties.

#### 9.1.1 Photon field

In general the photon (Coulomb) field is included in all the models
mentioned above when studying the properties of finite nuclei. In this
work the properties of infinite nuclear matter, specifically those which
are applicable to the study of neutron star matter, will be studied.
Since the Coulomb forces are much stronger than the gravitational forces
on the nuclear scale, neutron stars are assumed to be charge neutral [ 4
] , and therefore the contribution of the photon field is ignored in
this treatment of nuclear matter.

### 9.2 Lagrangian density

The most general Lagrangian density, that describes the QHD-I, NL-SH,
NL3, FSUGold, PK1, TM1 and TM2 parameter sets in QHD, is [ 37 ] :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.1)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

where the field tensors have been defined as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --

with

-   @xmath the isodoublet baryon field (only protons and neutrons are
    considered in this work),

-   @xmath the sigma (scalar) meson field,

-   @xmath the omega (vector) meson field,

-   @xmath is the Lorentz vector field denoting the three isospin
    components of the rho meson fields,

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    The charged rho meson fields ( @xmath ) can be constructed in terms
    of the first two components of @xmath as [ 4 ]

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (9.3)
      -- -------- -- -------

    and,

-   @xmath the isospin operator. This operator is described in terms of
    the Pauli 2 @xmath 2 spin-matrices ( 5.8 ) as

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    It should be noted that since the nucleon field, @xmath is an
    isodoublet and therefore

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    where is the @xmath is the proton field and @xmath is the neutron
    field, each consisting of the 4 @xmath 1 Dirac spinors, that the
    total dimension of @xmath is 8 @xmath 1. Therefore @xmath is in
    actual fact given by

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (9.4)
      -- -------- -- -------

    and therefore the explicit expression for @xmath , using explicit
    representation of @xmath ( 5.8c ), is

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (9.5)
      -- -------- -- -------

Using the Euler-Lagrange equation ( 6.4 ) the equations of motion of the
different fields are:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.6a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.6b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.6c)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.6d)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

### 9.3 Conventions

In the literature two different conventions for expressing the
Lagrangian density of QHD are used. These differences are obvious when
the Lagrangian density and the values of the coupling constants of the
NL3 parameter set in Ref. [ 44 ] are compared to those in Ref. [ 42 ] .
The way in which the Lagrangian density ( 9.1 ) is expressed will be
referred to as the Walecka convention, which is used in the original
formulation of QHD by J. D. Walecka (see Ref. [ 21 ] ). The other
convention of expressing the Lagrangian density is mainly used by
authors from Europe and the Orient. This formulation will be referred to
as the Ring convention.
The differences are:

1.  In the Walecka convention the scalar field @xmath is explicitly
    positive, where as in the Ring convention it is negative.

2.  The first four components in the nucleon field, @xmath , of the
    Walecka convention refer to the proton field and the last four to
    neutron field, whereas in the Ring convention the first four
    components of the nucleon field refer to the neutron field and the
    last four to the proton field.

3.  In the Walecka convention the coupling between the rho-field, @xmath
    and the isospin density, @xmath has an explicit factor of a half and
    in the Ring convention this factor is implied.

In this work the Walecka convention will be used. The expressions in the
Ring convention will be given for certain properties, but will be
identified as such. Both conventions are included in this work, because
the different QHD parameter sets were studied in the specific context
that they were defined in. It should also be noted that while certain
terms will be present in one convention it might not be present in the
other. This is due to the fact that different parameter sets include
different couplings and as such certain couplings might only be used in
parameter sets studied by authors using a specific convention.
It should also be noted that the coupling constants are defined
separately for each convention.
The differences between the two conventions are contrasted in Table 9.1
.

#### 9.3.1 Note on @xmath

The reduced mass ( 8.8 ),

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

is only defined in terms of the generic baryon mass, @xmath . The
baryons considered in this work are protons and neutrons and their
masses are usually taken to be equal (939 MeV). However, the PK1
parameter set distinguishes between the proton and the neutron mass (see
Table 9.5 ). This distinction should be taken (and is taken into account
in this work) when calculating @xmath in the PK1 parameter set, but it
is not explicitly shown in the expressions for @xmath .

### 9.4 Relativistic mean-field theory

As in Chapter 8 the equations of motion for the different fields are
solved in the relativistic mean-field approximation, which assumes that
the ground state of a uniform, static, spherical symmetric system is
described and therefore the meson fields can be replaced their
expectation values [ 37 ] :

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The spatial components of @xmath and @xmath vanish due to the
consideration of a uniform, static ground state (as was explained in
Chapter 8 ). The ground state is also assumed to have definite spin and
parity. Since the first two components of @xmath can be written in terms
of raising and lowering operators of the charged rho meson fields ( 9.3
), only the third component (that describes the neutral rho meson,
@xmath ) has a non-vanishing expectation value in the RMF approximation
[ 4 ] .
Correspondingly the baryon sources in the equations of motion are
replaced by their normal-order expectation values in the RMF grondstate,
@xmath ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

In the RMF approximation, the equations of motion of the fields ( 9.6 )
reduce to:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath               (9.8a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.8b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.8c)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.8d)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

In the Ring convention ² ² 2 The coupling between the rho- and the omega
meson fields, @xmath , is not included in any of the parameter sets
studied within the Ring convention. the equations of motion are given
by:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.9a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.9b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.9c)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.9d)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

In the RMF approximation the Lagrangian density ( 9.1 ) reduces to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath                     (9.10)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Using the RMF Lagrangian density and ( 6.14 ) [keeping Eq. ( 9.8d ) in
mind] the energy density and the pressure are given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
                                         
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.11a)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.11b)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

where @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.12)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

### 9.5 Evaluation of expectation values

The expectation values in the equations of motion of both conventions
[Eqs ( 9.8 ) and ( 9.9 )] and the equation of state ( 9.11 ), were
evaluated using the method given by N.K. Glendenning in Ref. [ 4 ] ,
which is explained in Sec. 8.4 .
The calculation is essentially the same as in Sec. 8.4 , with the only
difference being that the expression for the Dirac Hamiltonian, @xmath ,
and the positive single-particle energies ( @xmath ) are slightly
different. In this case, @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

and @xmath by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and the expansion for @xmath is taken to be as in ( 8.6 ),
with only the value for @xmath changing.
Using the above it can be established that the expression of @xmath will
not change from that in Chapter 8 , except in this case the contribution
of the baryons are evaluated separately (each baryon has 2 spin states,
and @xmath and @xmath denote the fermi momenta of the different
species),

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.15)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

The same applies to the expression for @xmath ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.16)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

To evaluate @xmath , a slightly different approach will be used. Since
the baryon field can be expanded in terms of the different baryon
components (in this case protons and neutrons), each described by a four
component Dirac spinor, @xmath can be written as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

@xmath is given by Eq. ( 9.5 ) and therefore the effect of the operation
of @xmath will be to separate the contribution of the baryons into a
positive (proton) and negative (neutron) parts. The single particle
expectation value will therefore be given, since the states are
normalised, by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and thus

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.17)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Since the following expression still holds

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

the expectation value in the expression of the pressure ( 9.11b ) does
not change, and is therefore still given by ( 8.19 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

However, the expression for @xmath differs from the one in Chapter 8
[compare ( 8.9 ) and ( 9.14 )]. The expectation value in the expression
for the energy density is now given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.19)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

### 9.6 Parameter sets

The parameters for the QHD-I calculations done in this work are those
given by B.D. Serot and J.D. Walecka in Ref. [ 22 ] .
The Ring NL3 parameters are taken from the original article by G.A.
Lalazissis et al. [ 42 ] , while the parameters in the Walecka
convention are from Ref. [ 44 ] .
The parameters for the PK1 model are taken from the article by W. Long
et al. [ 43 ] , while the NL-SH and TM1 (as well as TM2) paramater sets

the article by Y. Sugahara and H. Toki [ 41 ] , respectively.
The parameters for the FSUGold model and the NL3 parameters in the
Walecka convention are given by B. Todd-Rutel and J. Piekarewicz in Ref.
[ 44 ] .

while those for the Ring convention are given in Tables 9.4 and 9.5 .

### 9.7 Equation of state

The equations of motion of the different meson fields ( 9.8 ) reduce to
the following expressions when the results of Sec. 9.5 are taken into
account. In the Walecka convention the equations of motion ( 9.8 )
reduce to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
                                         
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.20a)
                                @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.20b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.20c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

The equations of motion of the fields in the Ring convention ( 9.9 )
are, after also considering the results of Sec. 9.5 , as well as the
difference between the conventions (Table 9.1 ),

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
                                         
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.21a)
                                @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.21b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.21c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

Using the expression for @xmath ( 9.12 ) and the results of Sec. 9.5 ,
the energy density ( 9.11a ) and the pressure ( 9.11b ) in the Walecka
convention yields

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
                                         
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
                       @xmath            
                       @xmath            
                                         
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.22b)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

In the Ring convention the energy density and the pressure are given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
                                         
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
                       @xmath            
                       @xmath            
                                         
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.23b)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

### 9.8 Nuclear matter observables

#### 9.8.1 Symmetry energy

The symmetry energy coefficient for the different parameter sets is
calculated in exactly the same way as it was done for QHD-I in Sec.
8.7.1 , except that in this case the energy density has more isospin
dependent terms.
The general expression for the energy density is given by equation (
9.22 ). By examining the equations of motion of the different meson
fields ( 9.20 ), it is clear that the scalar meson field is isospin
independent. The omega meson field has an implied isospin dependence
through the @xmath -coupling to the rho meson field (which is explicitly
isospin dependent). Thus the only explicitly isospin dependent part of
the energy density, defined as @xmath , is

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                                
              @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

From the equation of motion of the rho meson field ( 9.20c ), @xmath can
be written in terms of @xmath as

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The expression for @xmath then becomes

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.24)
                                @xmath   
                                         
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Thus the defining equation for the symmetry energy coefficient Eq. ( 4.1
) reduces to,

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

after some algebra and using the definition for the baryon density at
saturation ( 8.25 ). Note that the last two terms of Eq. ( 9.24 ) are
the same as the two terms in Eq. ( 8.26 ) and the answer can be directly
substituted.
In the Ring convention @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

and @xmath by

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The expression for @xmath in the Ring convention yields

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

### 9.9 Summary

In this chapter the equation of state of nuclear matter was calculated
using various parameter sets of the QHD model of nuclear matter in RMF
approximation.
This information will be used to calculate the equation of state of
neutron star matter.

## Chapter 10 Description of neutron star matter

### 10.1 Introduction

Neutron stars are extraordinary objects. Having approximately the same
density as atomic nuclei but being about @xmath times larger, these
objects have to be approached in a manner different from “normal”
matter. If the densities of neutron stars are considered, one can
conclude that neutron stars could consist, in some part, of normal
nuclear matter (protons and neutrons). Thus an oversimplified
description of a neutron star is that of a giant nucleus with mass
number of @xmath [ 4 ] . As mentioned in Chapter 1 , the difference
between a neutron star and a normal nucleus is that where the nucleus is
bound by the nuclear strong force, the neutron star is bound by gravity.
Thus the description of a neutron star must be anchored in general
relativity to account for the gravitational effect of not only the mass,
but also the energy of this ultra-dense object. Using the principles of
the special and general theories of relativity the
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation describing a static, spherical
symmetric neutron star was derived in Chapter 3 . To solve the TOV
equation, the relationship between the energy density and the pressure
(equation of state) in the interior of the star must be known.
The neutron star must also be charge neutral: while the gravitational
forces are very strong on the large scale, a nett charge would result in
very disruptive Coulomb-forces in the neutron star [ 4 ] .
The focus in this chapter will be on deriving the equation of state for
matter in the neutron star interior by considering various physical
effects, such as beta-equilibrium as well as the contribution of the
neutron star crust.

### 10.2 Crustal effects

The crust of a neutron star is usually divided into the inner and the
outer crust. The outer crust ranges from the density where atomic nuclei
become fully ionised, at about @xmath g/cm @xmath ( @xmath MeV/fm @xmath
), up to the density at which the nucleus becomes so neutron-rich that
neutrons start to drip from the nucleus ( “the neutron drip line”) [ 45
] .
The inner crust covers the density range from the neutron drip line up
to the density (denoted by @xmath ) at which nuclei cease to exist and
nuclear matter undergoes a phase transition to a uniform liquid [ 46 ] .

#### 10.2.1 Outer crust

The BPS equation of state is commonly used to describe the outer crust
of neutron stars. This equation of state was first described by G. Baym,
C. Pethick and P. Sutherland in 1971 [ 46 ] . The departure point of the
BPS equation of state is that the nuclei in the crust of a neutron star
are arranged in a body-centred cubic (bcc) lattice immersed in a sea of
free electrons, and that the energy of the system can be lowered by the
capture of energetic electrons by protons (inverse beta decay) [ 46 ] .
The beta-decay of neutrons in the outer crust is (at this point) blocked
by the filled electron states [ 46 ] . The lattice contributes to lower
the energy of the system by minimising the Coulomb interaction energy of
the nuclei [ 45 ] .

At a specific pressure the nucleus that minimises the chemical
potential, @xmath , of the system is deemed the equilibrium nucleus. The
pressure range spanned by the outer crust is therefore defined by a
sequence of equilibrium nuclei. Each equilibrium nucleus defines a
certain pressure range which is characterised by the maximum mass
(energy) density, @xmath , at which the nucleus can be deemed the
equilibrium nucleus. At any given pressure in the outer crust the
properties of the equilibrium nucleus (either gathered from experimental
data or from some theoretical model of the nucleus) together with the
energy of the electrons determine the energy density. Since the pressure
in the neutron star crust increases as a smooth function of depth, each
transition from one equilibrium nucleus to another, will be accompanied
by a discontinuity in the energy density [ 46 ] . This can be clearly
seen in Fig. 10.1 where the BPS equations of state represented by the
sequence of equilibrium nuclei in Tables 10.1 and 10.2 , have been
plotted.
The BPS equation of state is described in detail in Refs [ 45 ] and [ 46
] , and can be summarised as follows: the pressure, P, is given, for an
equilibrium nucleus characterised by A (mass number) and Z (proton
number), by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

-   @xmath is the number density of nuclei, related to the baryon number
    density ( @xmath ) by

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

-   @xmath is the contribution from the free electrons with fermi
    momentum ( @xmath ) and mass ( @xmath )

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

-   @xmath is the lattice energy per nucleus

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    where @xmath is the charge of an electron and @xmath is given for a
    bcc lattice by,

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

The energy density ( @xmath ) is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

-   @xmath is the total energy of an isolated nucleus, and,

-   @xmath the total electron energy density given by

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (10.3)
      -- -------- -- --------

The equilibrium nucleus is determined by the @xmath , @xmath
configuration that minimizes the chemical potential, @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The sequence of equilibrium nuclei used in the original BPS paper is
shown in Table 10.1 , where the properties of the equilibrium nuclei
were calculated in Ref. [ 45 ] , using the nuclear data set that was
used in the original BPS paper (Ref. [ 46 ] , which was published in
1971, and used nuclear data from the 1960’s). Since experimental
techniques have undergone some improvement since the 1960’s, the
sequence of equilibrium nuclei between mass (energy) densities of @xmath
g/cm @xmath ( @xmath MeV/fm @xmath ) and @xmath g/cm @xmath ( @xmath
MeV/fm @xmath ) can be determined from experimental data [ 45 ] . The
sequence of equilibrium nuclei in Table 10.2 was calculated in Ref. [ 45
] using modern experimental nuclear data and nuclear models. The upper
part of the table was determined from experimental data (compiled by G.
Audi et al. ), while the lower part was calculated using a modern
relativistic nuclear field theory model by L.S. Geng et al. called TMA
(see Ref. [ 45 ] and references therein).
The BPS equation of state can be determined from either Table 10.1 or
Table 10.2 . It can be done by either interpolating the energy density
at a given pressure, or at a specific pressure (and hence equilibrium
nucleus) the contribution of the electrons to the pressure can be
determined from Eq. ( 10.1 ) and the fermi momenta of the electrons (
@xmath ) obtained. If @xmath is known, @xmath can be determined from Eq.
( 10.3 ). Using the value of @xmath and the properties of the
equilibrium nuclei, the energy density can then be obtained from Eq. (
10.2 ).

#### 10.2.2 Inner crust

The BBP equation of state (by G. Baym, H. A. Bethe and C. J. Pethick [
47 ] ) assumes that at densities above the neutron drip line, up to
@xmath , nuclear matter consists of a lattice of nuclei immersed in a
gas of free neutrons. The equation of state is calculated by matching
the pressure and the energy density of the lattice nuclei to that of a
free neutron gas [ 47 ] . The equation of state is given in Table 10.4
(at the end of the chapter).
The value of the density at which the inner crust becomes a uniform
liquid ( @xmath ) depends on the model (and parameter set) used to
describe the matter of the neutron star crust and interior. J. Carriere
et al. calculated the value of @xmath for different QHD parameter sets
in Ref. [ 48 ] . In Ref. [ 48 ] the authors used the relativistic
random-phase approximation to analyse if and when a system consisting of
protons, neutrons and electron would undergo a second-order phase
transition. For the inner crust they assumed a polytropic equation of
state,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are constants that are determined so that the
above equation of state matches the equation of state for the outer
crust (pressure and energy density) at the neutron drip line as well as
the equation of state of the liquid interior at @xmath .

### 10.3 Equilibrium conditions

Free neutrons are not stable particles and have a half-life of about 10
minutes [ 49 ] . The neutron will decay into a proton, electron and an
antineutrino (beta-decay):

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Therefore free neutrons in the neutron star will undergo beta-decay
creating a proton and neutron. Since a neutron stars exists for a period
longer than the half-life of a neutron, a significant number of neutrons
in the star will undergo beta-decay. Since a neutron star consists of a
huge amount of neutrons, the number of electrons (resulting from the
beta-decay of neutrons) present in the star will also be quite
significant. Due to the densities of the electrons, some electrons will
attain relativistic energies, making the inverse process (capture of a
electron by a proton to form a neutron) energetically favourable, i.e.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The two decay processes mentioned above represent two competing
processes and since the neutron star has a lifetime that is long
compared to the timescale of these decay processes, the matter in the
star has time to reach beta-equilibrium. The beta-equilibrated state is
the state where, for a fixed baryon number density ( @xmath ), the
proton and neutron number densities ( @xmath and @xmath ) are such that
the energy density ( @xmath ) of the system is at a minimum. From Ref. [
4 ] , the condition for beta-equilibrium can be expressed in terms of
the chemical potential (Fermi energy), @xmath . If @xmath refers to the
chemical potential of a specific particle specie, @xmath , then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The effects of the neutrinos are not considered in the beta-equilibrated
state, for their mean-free path is longer than the radius of the star [
4 ] , and therefore the beta-equilibrated state is described by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

The number density of particle @xmath ( @xmath ) can be expressed in
terms of the fermi momentum ( @xmath ) as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and from the above @xmath is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which is a handy result when evaluating the chemical potentials of
different particles.
Using the expression for the energy density ( 10.11a ), the chemical
potentials of the different particles can be expressed as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --

The condition for beta-equilibrium ( 10.5 ) can therefore be
generalised, for all parameter sets considered in this work, to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.7)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the Ring convention, the expression for beta-equilibrium is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.8)
  -- -------- -- --------

In ultra-dense matter electrons can attain ultra-relativistic energies
and therefore it may become energetically more favourable to populate
muon states. Muons have the same charge as an electron, but a mass of
105.7 MeV [ 50 ] . In this work it is assumed that muon states will be
populated once the electrons reach energies comparable to the mass of
the muon. Muons are unstable particles and undergoes the following decay
reaction [ 4 ] :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Equilibrium with regards to the above reaction implies that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.9)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the muon chemical potential is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since the neutron star is assumed to be neutral, the number of protons
must be equal to the number of electrons present. In terms of the fermi
momenta of the species this means that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

but if muon-states are also populated, the condition for charge
equilibrium will have to be expressed as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which implies that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.10)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Neutron stars are in general equilibrium when the conditions of ( 10.5
), ( 10.9 ) and ( 10.10 ) are satisfied.

### 10.4 Equation of state

#### 10.4.1 Without a crust

The energy density and the pressure of neutron star matter in general
equilibrium, assuming a QHD description for nuclear matter that contains
protons, neutrons, electrons, muons and mesons ( @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath ) is, from ( 9.22 ):

  ------ -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
                                             
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (10.11a)
                           @xmath   @xmath   
                           @xmath   @xmath   
                           @xmath   @xmath   
  and,                                       
                                             
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (10.11b)
                           @xmath   @xmath   
                           @xmath   @xmath   
                           @xmath   @xmath   
  ------ -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

where @xmath denotes the lepton (electrons and muons) state.

#### 10.4.2 Including a crust

In this work the BPS equation of state is used for the outer crust. Both
the original sequence of nuclei (of Table 10.1 ) and modern calculations
of the sequence of nuclei using the TMA model (as in Table 10.2 ) are
used. The difference between the resulting equations of state is shown
in Fig. 10.1 . When the values of Table 10.1 are used for the sequence
of equilibrium nuclei, it will be denoted by BPS. When those of Table
10.2 are used, it will be denoted by TMA.
For the equation of state of the inner crust the BBP equation of state
was initially used, but since only the energy density or the pressure
can be matched at @xmath the equation of state has a rather large
discontinuity, as can be seen in Fig. 10.2 . As such the BBP equation of
state was not used in further calculations presented in this work.
Rather the polytropic equation of state ( 10.4 ) for the inner crust is
used, since the values of @xmath and @xmath can be calculated to the
equation of state of the liquid interior at @xmath . Due to time
constraints, the calculation of @xmath for the different QHD parameter
sets was not repeated. Rather the published values for @xmath , where
available, were used. For the parameter sets for which values of @xmath
are not available, the value of the pressure at @xmath was estimated to
be @xmath dyne/cm @xmath ( @xmath MeV/fm @xmath ). This pressure is
simply the average pressure, corresponding to the published values for
@xmath , in the specific parameter sets. The published values for @xmath
, together with the corresponding pressures, are listed in Table 10.3 .
When crustal effects are included, the equation of state of the liquid
interior of the star is given by the energy density and the pressure
derived for the QHD description of the neutron star interior ( 10.11 ).
The equation of state of the neutron star interior, when crustal effects
are included, can therefore be summarised as

  -- -- -- ---------
           (10.12)
  -- -- -- ---------

### 10.5 Neutron star constraints

As with any investigation into natural phenomena, experimental and
observational inputs are crucial to the development of the description
of a physical system. In the case of neutron stars these inputs could
stem from experiments or astrophysical observations. Recently a testing
scheme based on various different constraints derived from heavy-ion
collisions and astrophysical observations has been proposed by T. Kl
@xmath hn et al. [ 51 ] . In this section the constraints proposed in
Ref. [ 51 ] and other publications, applicable to the scope of this
work, will be discussed.

#### 10.5.1 General theory of relativity

From the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation ( 3.1 ) it is implied that
the radius of the star ( @xmath ) cannot be smaller or equal to @xmath .
If this condition is not obeyed, the change in the pressure is infinite
or increases as one moves from the centre of the star to the boundary.
@xmath defines a massive object’s Schwarzschild radius and if the radius
of the object lies within its Schwarzschild radius, i.e.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

then the object has collapsed under its gravity and is a black hole [ 4
] .

#### 10.5.2 Observational constraints

The mass of a neutron star in a binary system can be quite accurately
measured [ 5 ] and the mass of various neutron stars have been
determined. The list of known masses of neutron stars is given in Fig.
10.3 .
The known neutron star masses cover a narrow range, between about 1.4
and 1.5 @xmath (solar mass). This narrow mass range may be due to
special circumstances that govern the evolution of binaries, but no
thorough explanation has been put forward to date [ 5 ] . The heaviest
known neutron star is PSR J0751+1807 with a mass of @xmath [ 52 ] . The
reproduction of this mass by any model for the neutron star interior
(equation of state) has been hailed as a very important constraint in
determining whether certain models for the neutron star interior are
applicable or not [ 51 ] . J. M. Lattimer and M. Prakash have however
warned in Ref. [ 5 ] that caution should be exercised before the
currently known heavy neutron stars are taken as firm evidence that such
heavy neutron stars exists, due to uncertainties in the measurements.
To determine the radius of a neutron star is much more difficult than
the mass and there are large uncertainties in the measurements [ 3 ] .
To date, the only neutron star whose mass and radius has been determined
is EXO 0748-676 [ 53 ] . A. R. Villarreal and T. E. Strohmayer
established that the mass of EXO 0748-676 must lie between 1.5 and 2.3
@xmath while the radius could lie between 9.5 and 15 km [ 54 ] . F.
@xmath zel determined the lower limits of the mass and radius of EXO
0748-676 to be @xmath and @xmath km [ 53 ] .
These considerations are used in this work to evaluate different
equations of state for the neutron star interior.

### 10.6 Summary

In this chapter a description of a neutron star was presented, based on
certain assumptions about the crust of the neutron star as well as
equilibrium conditions in the interior of the star.
The equation of state of neutron star matter was also derived.

## Chapter 11 Results and discussion

The results in this chapter were generated by writing a computer program
to solve the applicable equations in the FORTRAN90 programming language.
A description of the programs as well as the actual equations that were
used in the computations, are given in Appendix A .

### 11.1 Properties of saturated nuclear matter

The properties of saturated nuclear matter were calculated using the
different parameter sets discussed in Chapters 8 and 9 (QHD-I, NL-SH,
TM1, TM2, NL3, PK1 and FSUGold). The calculated values are compared to
the published ones for the different parameter sets. The results are
listed in Tables 11.1 , 11.2 and 11.3 . The properties of saturated
nuclear matter calculated in this work shows good agreement with the
published values.

To determine the accuracy with which the FORTRAN90 program calculates
the properties of saturated nuclear matter, these properties were also
calculated using the NL-SH, TM1 and TM2 parameter sets. However, from
this point onwards only the QHD-I, NL3, PK1 and FSUGold parameter sets
will be considered.
The binding energies around the saturation density (at a fermi momentum
of 1.30 fm @xmath ) of the QHD-I, NL3, PK1 and FSUGold parameter sets
are shown in Fig. 11.1 . From this plot it is clear that the different
parameters sets have very different high density behaviour. All the
parameter sets give almost exactly the same values for the binding
energies below saturation, but above saturation the values diverge. (The
QHD1 parameter set was fitted to reproduce a binding energy at
saturation of -15.75 MeV and therefore its description differs slightly
from that given by the other parameter sets [ 22 ] .) These
discrepancies in the description of the binding energy at high densities
emphasise that more information about dense matter is needed to better
constrain the descriptions of nuclear matter.

### 11.2 Neutron star properties

In this work the NL3, PK1 and FSUGold parameter sets will be used to
compare different calculated neutron star properties. The FSUGold
parameter set will be the default.

#### 11.2.1 Inclusion of different particles

As a first approximation the neutron star can be considered to be
exclusively composed out of neutrons. This satisfies the condition of
charge neutrality, but not the condition of beta-equilibrium, as
expounded upon in Chapter 10 . By including the effects of
beta-equilibrium the maximum mass of the neutron star sequence is
reduced, i.e. the equation of state is softened. As was explained in
Sec. 4.1.4 , a hard equation of state is when the energy density
increases rapidly with an increase in pressure and a soft equation of
state is when the increase in the energy density is more gradual. The
equation of state is softened by the inclusion of different particles in
the description of neutron star matter, because if it becomes
energetically favourable to populate the states of, for example muons,
the lowest energy muon states will be populated first, instead of the
electron states, thereby reducing the increase in the energy density as
the pressure increases. Fig. 11.2 is an illustration of the softening of
the equation of state by the inclusion of additional particles to the
description of neutron star matter. If the neutron star is further
considered to not only be in beta-equilibrium, but in general
equilibrium as well (thus also including muons, instead of just protons,
neutrons and electrons), the maximum mass of a particular sequence is
further reduced.

Table 11.4 lists the maximum masses of a pure neutron neutron star, one
in beta-equilibrium and a neutron star in general equilibrium, for
different parameter sets. Fig. 11.3 shows the effect of the softening of
the equation of state on the mass-radius relationship (equation of state
described by the FSUGold parameter set).

#### 11.2.2 Crustal effects

The inclusion of crustal effects does not affect the mass of the neutron
star, when compared to the case where crustal effects have not been
included. However, the radii of neutron stars are in general larger when
crustal effects are considered.
The reason that the inclusion of crustal effects do not influence the
mass of the neutron star is that it does not affect the central pressure
in the neutron star. The central pressure corresponds to the amount of
overlying mass. The effect of the inclusion of crustal effects is rather
to lower the pressure gradient near the boundary of the star, thereby
enlarging the radius of the star. Fig. 11.4 shows the neutron star
mass-radius sequence, for an equation of state based on the FSUGold
parameter set, where different descriptions for the outer crust (TMA and
BPS), as well as the polytropic equation of state for the inner crust
have been included. Fig. 11.5 shows the plot of the neutron star mass
against the central density of this calculation.

#### 11.2.3 Observational constraints

As argued in Section 10.5.2 observational evidence and theoretical
constraints have to be taken into account to determine the appropriate
descriptions of the neutron star interior. Fig. 11.6 shows the plot of
mass-radius sequences corresponding to different equations of state.
From Fig. 11.6 it can be seen that the NL3 and PK1 parameter sets
provide a description which is in good agreement with current
observational data, while the FSUGold description may seem to be too
soft, if the maximum masses of each sequence (as given in Table 11.5 )
are considered.
J. Piekarewicz has pointed out these apparent deficiencies of the
FSUGold parameter set in Ref. [ 55 ] , but also stated that it would be
rather naive to only consider neutron star constraints to determine the
equations of state of dense matter. The difference between NL3 and PK1
parameter sets, is that the PK1 set includes an additional self-coupling
in the omega meson field ( @xmath ). Comparing the PK1 and FSUGold
parameter sets, it will be seen that the FSUGold parameter set contains
a further coupling between the two vector boson fields ( @xmath and
@xmath ), @xmath , which was introduced to soften the symmetry at high
density [ 44 ] . However, the density dependence of the symmetry energy
is currently unknown, so @xmath could not yet be firmly constrained [ 55
] . However, the Parity Radius Experiment (PREX) aims to accurately
measure the neutron radius of @xmath Pb, which would provide an accurate
determination of the density dependence of the symmetry energy [ 3 ] .
PREX will be conducted at Jefferson Laboratories in the United States
and is currently scheduled for February 2009 [ 56 ] .

## Chapter 12 Conclusions

In this work the equations of state of neutron star matter were derived
using the quantum hadrodynamics model of nuclei and nuclear matter by
the application of the relativisitc mean-field approximation for the
NL3, PK1 and FSUGold parameter sets. It was also shown (as was done in
similar works, such as Refs [ 48 , 55 ] and [ 57 ] ) that these derived
equations of state can be applied to calculate the mass-radius
relationship of a neutron star and that these calculated values show
good agreement with current observational data. However, further
measurements of the properties of nuclear matter as well as that of
neutron stars are necessary to obtain a complete description of dense
nuclear matter.
As argued by various authors, a description of dense matter should not
be based on a single set of observables or a class of observables, but
rather the most applicable description of dense matter would be the one
that describes a plethora of different observables accurately [ 51 , 55
] . Unfortunately our knowledge of dense matter, in whatever form, is
currently limited. Fortunately it is foreseen that with upcoming
experiments at current and new particle accelerator facilities, as well
as the development of new telescopes, particularly radio-telescopes,
much will be uncovered and discovered about terrestrial and
extra-terrestrial dense matter in the near future. To gather a more
complete picture of dense matter, works, such as this one, would be
increasingly important in providing a link between laboratory physics
and astrophysics. However, through the study of nuclear physics alone,
this picture would not be easily attained and therefore the need for
cooperation between astro- and nuclear physicists is greater than ever.
The application of relativistic mean-field theory to the quantum
hadrodynamics has therefore shown itself to be relevant to the
description of finite nuclei and nuclear matter [ 22 ] , as well as the
description of neutron stars, based solely on a handful of coupling
constants.

## Appendix A Code Documentation

All numerical problems in this work were solved using programs that were
written for this purpose in FORTRAN90 programming language. This
appendix will give a brief overview of these computer programs.

### a.1 Introduction

To obtain the mass-radius relationship of a neutron star using a
specific parameter set in QHD is quite a complex physical and
mathematical problem. Even after using RMF to approximate the
description of nuclear matter, the equations that have to be solved are
rarely exact, at most self-consisted. The main problem of applying a
description of nuclear matter to neutron stars can be split into the
following components:

1.  obtaining the values of the unknown meson fields in the RMF
    approximation,

2.  calculating the equation of state of neutron star matter, and,

3.  using the equation of state to solve the TOV equation.

In the following sections different parts of the code pertaining to the
above-mentioned problem will be discussed. Whenever a function or
subroutine is mentioned, it will be written in bold and subroutines are
denoted by the prefix sub_ and functions by the prefix func_ .

### a.2 sub_fields

Sub_fields is the subroutine used to calculate the RMF values of the
meson fields ( @xmath , @xmath and @xmath ).
A schematic representation of this subroutine is given in Fig. A.1 . As
imput sub_fields receives values of the proton and neutron fermi
momenta, @xmath (denoted by k_p) and @xmath (k_n), and the choice of the
parameter set (para_choice) for which the RMF meson field values have to
calculated. For each specific value of k_p and k_n sub_conversion is
called. Sub_conversion assigns all the coupling constants and masses as
well as the baryon number density (density_B) as global parameters for
the specific choice of para_choice. Once this is done the value of the
RMF meson fields can be calculated. This is done by solving the
self-consistent expressions for the different meson fields ( 9.20 ).
The values of the @xmath and @xmath are determined by comparing the
left- and right-hand sides of Eqs ( 9.20b ) and ( 9.20c ). The value of
the field on the left-hand side of the equation is incrementally
increased and then substituted into the expression on the right and the
values on the left and right are compared. The RMF meson fields get
assigned once the difference between the left and right sides are
acceptability small (about @xmath fm @xmath ).
In the case of @xmath the value of the reduced mass ( @xmath ) is
calculated, from which @xmath is then calculated using Eq. ( 9.7 ). An
expression for @xmath in terms of @xmath can be easily deduced from the
expressions for @xmath ( 9.20a ) and @xmath ( 9.7 ) and yields

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (A.1)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

The integral in the above expression is evaluated using the analytical
expression for the integral given in Appendix B .
After checking one final time if the self-consistent equations are
satisfied to the desired accuracy (this is necessary, especially since
in the FSUGold parameter set there is a coupling between @xmath and
@xmath which complicates the calculation) the values of @xmath [denoted
by sigma_0 ( sic ) throughout the code], @xmath (m_reduced), @xmath
(omega_0) and @xmath (rho_0) are assigned (as global variables).

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

are also assigned. @xmath and @xmath are used in the calculation of the
energy density and the pressure and stem from the analytical solution to
the integrals Appendix B in the expression for the energy density and
the pressure ( 9.22 ).
The differences between the Walecka and Ring conventions (see Sec. 9.3 )
necessitate the definition of a different subroutine to calculate the
RMF meson field values in the Ring convention. Sub_fieldsI is very
similar to sub_fields , but one of the few differences is that a
numerical approximation is made to calculate the integral in the
expression for @xmath .

### a.3 sub_epNS

This subroutine calculates the arrays containing corresponding values of
the energy density and the pressure to be used in sub_TOV , which solves
the TOV equation. Sub_epNS is represented graphically in Fig. A.2 .
Specific choices of the crust (crust_choice), equilibrium (beta of
general, eqm_choice) and the parameter set (para_choice) serve as input
to sub_epNS .
For a specific choice of the crust sub_pcutoff determines the transition
between the inner crust and the liquid interior and/or between the outer
and inner crust. It returns a value of @xmath and @xmath (k_cutn and
k_cutp) at the corresponding pressure or number density of the
transition.
If the description of matter in general equilibrium is required,
sub_muon returns the value of @xmath (k_max_no_muons) above which the
muons states will be populated. Sub_muon also assigns the minimum values
of @xmath (k_n_beta_min) at which the matter can be in beta-equilibrium.
The value of k_n_beta_min is not calculated by sub_muon , but was
determined by hand and then hard coded to be @xmath fm @xmath . Sub_beta
is used to determine the values of the proton, electron and muon fermi
momenta (kp, ke and kmu) corresponding to a neutron fermi momentum, kn
(which of course this calculation is parameter set specific). If only
beta-equilibrated matter is desired, sub_beta calls sub_beta2 , which
does the necessary.
If no crustal effects are considered, sub_fields is called to determine
the values of @xmath (sigma_0), @xmath (omega_0), @xmath (rho_0), @xmath
(x_p) and @xmath (x_n). These values, along with the values of @xmath
(k_e) and @xmath (k_mu), are then used by func_epsNS and func_presNS to
calculate the energy and the pressure of neutron star matter, using Eqs
( 9.22 ) and ( 9.22b ) respectively.
The equation of state for the outer crust is calculated by func_bps .
For the choice of the sequence of equilibrium nuclei (either TMA from
Table 10.2 or BPS from Table 10.1 ) and specific value of the pressure
in the outer crust, func_bps returns the energy density. For the inner
crust the BBP equation of state can be used or the polytropic equation
of state [denoted by RPA in the program and given by Eq. ( 10.4 )]. The
BBP equation of state is calculated by reading the values given in Table
10.4 from file (BBPE.txt and BBPP.txt for the energy density and the
pressure respectively) and determined by interpolating the energy
density at a specific pressure. The polytropic equation of state is
calculated by first determining the values for @xmath and @xmath . Using
equation 10.4 the energy density is calculated for each input value of
the pressure. The equation of state of the liquid interior of the
neutron star is given by calling func_epsNS and func_presNS for values
of @xmath (kn) greater than kcutn.
The output of sub_epNS is a file, ep.txt, which contains the pressure in
the first column and the energy density in the second. The following
data is also printed to file: The value of @xmath (kn) and @xmath (kp)
to kn_kp_ep.txt; @xmath (ke), @xmath (kmu) and density_B ( @xmath ) to
ke_kmu_ep.txt, while fields_ep.txt contains the values of @xmath
(sigma_0), @xmath (omega_0) and @xmath (rho_0).

### a.4 sub_TOV

This subroutine solves the TOV equation. As input sub_TOV receives the
neutron fermi momentum (k_fn) assumed to describe the matter at the
centre of the star, as well as the choices for the parameter set, crust
and equilibrium conditions. The equation of state have to be read into
the pres and eps arrays as global variables, this has to be done before
sub_TOV is called.
Sub_TOV solves the TOV equation using the Runge-Kutta method to solve a
coupled differential equation.
For a given coupled differential equation, such as Eqs ( 3.1 ) and ( 3.2
),

If crustal effects are taking into consideration sub_TOV uses the above
method to integrate the TOV equation until the pressure [ @xmath ]
becomes @xmath MeV/fm @xmath , which denotes the value of the pressure
were the crust of a neutron star starts, from Ref. [ 45 ] . If crustal
effects are not considered sub_TOV integrates until the pressure [
@xmath ] becomes @xmath MeV/fm @xmath (the lowest pressure at which
matter can be in beta-equilibrium).
Due to the units of the variables care should be taken with the
expressions for @xmath and @xmath as pointed out in Refs [ 20 , 58 ] .
@xmath and @xmath are of the order of a couple solar masses and
kilometres respectively, while @xmath and @xmath are in MeV/fm @xmath .
Thus to be able to handle these equations numerically, they have to be
scaled. An appropriate choice would be to describe @xmath in terms of
solar masses, i.e.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where

-   @xmath is a solar mass (in MeV) as given in Table 1.1 , and,

-   @xmath is a dimensionless quantity

as well as to express @xmath in units of metres.
Defining the following quantities

-   @xmath with G the gravitational constant in MeV/fm @xmath from Table
    1.1 , and,

-   @xmath ,

( A.2 ) can be rewritten as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
                                         
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (A.3a)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                         
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (A.3b)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

The above equations are the ones used by sub_TOV to calculate the
mass-radius relationships of neutron stars in this work.

    coefficients generated by sub_csplin .

The module mod_globals contains all the global parameters as well as

-    sub_choice a simple subroutine that prints the choices made to the
    screen, and,

-    sub_conversion,

    matter for a choice of parameter set and prints the results to the
    screen and to the file sat_prop.txt,

-    sub_muon , and,

-    sub_pcutoff ,

which were all introduced previously.
Finally mod_TOVFSU contains

-    sub_TOV ,

-    func_TOV1Fus , and,

-    func_TOV1Gus which contains the expressions for the right hand side
    of the equations used to solve the TOV equation ( A.3 ).

### a.6 Codes for different choices

The codes for choices of the parameters sets, crustal effects and
equilibrium condition are: Parameter sets

-   1 FSUGold

-   2 QHD1

-   3 NL3 (Walecka convention)

-   31 NL3 (Ring convention)

-   51 PK1

-   61 NL-SH

-   71 TM1

-   81 TM2

Crustal choices

-   0 if no crustal effects included

-   1 if only outer crust, BPS equation of state based on TMA sequence
    of equilibrium nuclei,

-   2 if only outer crust, BPS equation of state based on BPS sequence
    of equilibrium nuclei,

-   31 if the BPS (TMA) equation of state for outer crust and BBP
    equation of state for the inner crust are required,

-   32 if the BPS (BPS) equation of state for outer crust and BBP
    equation of state for the inner crust are required,

-   11 if the BPS (TMA) equation of state for the outer crust and
    polytropic equation of state for inner crust are required, and,

-   12 if the BPS (BPS) equation of state for the outer crust and
    polytropic equation of state for inner crust are required.

Equilibrium conditions

-   1 for neutron star matter in general equilibrium,

-   2 for neutron star matter in beta-equilibrium only, and,

-   3 for pure neutron matter

To illustrate the accuracy of the different subroutines for the
different conventions the mass-radius relationship for the NL3 parameter
set, assuming neutron star matter in general equilibrium and no crustal
effects, is shown in Fig. A.3 .
