The Becchi-Rouet-Stora and Tyutin (BRST) transformation plays a crucial
role in the quantization of gauge theories. The BRST transformation is
also very important tool in characterizing the various renormalizable
field theoretic models. The generalization of the usual BRST
transformation, by making the infinitesimal global parameter finite and
field dependent, is commonly known as the finite field dependent BRST
(FFBRST) transformation. In this thesis, we have extended the FFBRST
transformation in an auxiliary field formulation and have developed both
on-shell and off-shell FF-anti-BRST transformations. The different
aspects of such transformation are studied in Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV)
formulation. FFBRST transformation has further been used to study the
celebrated Gribov problem and to analyze the constrained dynamics in
gauge theories. A new finite field dependent symmetry (combination of
FFBRST and FF-anti-BRST) transformation has been invented. The FFBRST
transformation is shown useful in connection of first-class constrained
theory to that of second-class also. Further, we have applied the
Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky (BFV) technique to quantize a field theoretic
model in the Hamiltonian framework. The Hodge de Rham theorem for
differential geometry has also been studied in such context.
