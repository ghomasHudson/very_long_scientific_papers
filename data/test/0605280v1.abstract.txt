In this Master of Science Thesis I introduce geometric algebra both from
the traditional geometric setting of vector spaces, and also from a more
combinatorial view which simplifies common relations and operations.
This view enables us to define Clifford algebras with scalars in
arbitrary rings and provides new suggestions for an infinite-dimensional
approach.

Furthermore, I give a quick review of classic results regarding
geometric algebras, such as their classification in terms of matrix
algebras, the connection to orthogonal and Spin groups, and their
representation theory. A number of lower-dimensional examples are worked
out in a systematic way using so called norm functions, while general
applications of representation theory include normed division algebras
and vector fields on spheres.

I also consider examples in relativistic physics, where reformulations
in terms of geometric algebra give rise to both computational and
conceptual simplifications.
