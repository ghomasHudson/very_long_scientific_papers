The present work is a slightly revised version of the author’s M.Sc.
thesis presented at the Physics department of Warsaw University,
investigating nonintegrable Riemannian geometries modelled after certain
symmetric spaces related to the Freudenthal-Tits Magic Square. The
collection of four such geometries investigated by Nurowski [ 1 ] has
been extended by further eight, together with a unified description
provided in terms of rank three Jordan algebras and associated
constructions. In particular, symmetric tensors reducing the orthogonal
group to adequate structure groups have been found and used to describe
geometric properties of corresponding @xmath -structures on manifolds.
The results obtained this way include: conditions for existence of a
natural complex or quaternionic Kähler structure; equivalence of the
existence of a characteristic connection and the Killing condition on
the tensor defining a @xmath -structure, which holds for four of the new
geometries, thus extending an analogous result of Nurowski. Moreover,
the geometries which admit a characteristic connection have been
classified. The paper is concluded by an algebraic construction of
locally reductive examples.
