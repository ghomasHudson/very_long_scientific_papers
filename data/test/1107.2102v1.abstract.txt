In this thesis, the class of modules whose Cousin complexes have
finitely generated cohomologies are studied as a subclass of modules
which have uniform local cohomological annihilators and it is shown that
these two classes coincide over local rings with Cohen-Macaulay formal
fibres. This point of view enables us to obtain some properties of
modules with finite Cousin complexes and find some characterizations of
them.

In this connection we discuss attached prime ideals of certain local
cohomology modules in terms of cohomologies of Cousin complexes. In
continuation, we study the top local cohomology modules with specified
set of attached primes.

Our approach to study Cousin complexes leads us to characterization of
generalized Cohen-Macaulay modules in terms of uniform annihilators of
local cohomology. We use these results to study the Cohen-Macaulay loci
of modules and find two classes of rings over which the Cohen-Macaulay
locus of any finitely generated module is a Zariskiâ€“open subset of the
spectrum of the ring.

Key words and phrases. Cousin complexes, uniform local cohomological
annihilator, Cohen-Macaulay locus, local cohomology, attached primes.
