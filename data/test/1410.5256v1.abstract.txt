This thesis is focused on the development of new mathematical methods
for computing multi-loop scattering amplitudes in gauge theories. In
this work we combine, for the first time, the unitarity-based
construction for integrands, and the recently introduced
integrand-reduction through multivariate polynomial division. After
discussing the generic features of this novel reduction algorithm, we
will apply it to the one- and two-loop five-point amplitudes in @xmath
sYM. The integrands of the multiple-cuts are generated from products of
tree-level amplitudes within the super-amplitudes formalism. The
corresponding expressions will be used for the analytic reconstruction
of the polynomial residues. Their parametric form is known a priori, as
derived by means of successive polynomial divisions using the Gröbner
basis associated to the on-shell denominators. The integrand reduction
method will be exploited to investigate the color-kinematic duality for
multi-loop @xmath sYM scattering amplitudes. Our analysis yields a
suggestive, systematic way to generate graphs which automatically
satisfy the color-kinematic dualities. Finally, we will extract the
leading ultra-violet divergences of five-point one- and two-loop
amplitudes in @xmath sYM, which represent a paradigmatic example for
studying the UV behavior of supersymmetric amplitudes.
