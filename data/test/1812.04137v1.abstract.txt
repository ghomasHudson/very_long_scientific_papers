A major current goal of noncommutative geometry is the classification of
noncommutative projective surfaces. The generic case is to understand
algebras birational to the Sklyanin algebra. In this thesis we complete
a considerable component of this problem.

Let @xmath denote the 3-dimensional Sklyanin algebra over an
algebraically closed field, and assume that @xmath is not a finite
module over its centre. In earlier work Rogalski, Sierra and Stafford
classified the maximal orders inside the 3-Veronese @xmath of @xmath .
We complete and extend their work and classify all maximal orders inside
@xmath . As in Rogalski, Sierra and Staffordâ€™s work, these can be viewed
as blowups at (possibly non-effective) divisors. A consequence of this
classification is that maximal orders are automatically noetherian among
other desirable properties.

This work both relies upon, and lends back to, the work of Rogalski,
Sierra and Stafford. In particular, we also provide a converse for their
classification of maximal orders in the higher Veronese subrings @xmath
of @xmath .
