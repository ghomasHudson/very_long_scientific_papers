We discuss quantum affine Gaudin models and affine opers in Chapter 8 ,
based on the preprints [ 5 ] and [ 6 ] of B. Vicedo, C.A.S. Young and
myself. We first show that functions on affine opers take the form of
hypergeometric integrals. Based on this result, we give a series of
conjectures about quantum higher order Hamiltonians of affine Gaudin
models and their spectrum. We support these conjectures by various
observations, in particular the construction of the cubic Hamiltonian.
The content of this chapter is mostly a less technical summary of [ 5 ]
, which is meant to be readable independently (although some of the
results of [ 5 ] are not discussed in this thesis). For brevity, the
main result of the preprint [ 6 ] (the construction of the cubic
Hamiltonian) is simply mentioned in Chapter 8 , without any details or
proofs.

We conclude this thesis by a brief overview and some perspectives in
Chapter 9 . Technical appendices about Lie algebras, Poisson and
symplectic geometries and @xmath -matrices form the last chapters A , B
and C .
