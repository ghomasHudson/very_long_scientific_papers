The governing equations ( 1.8 ), ( 1.43 )â€“( 1.45 ), ( 1.49 ) and ( 1.50
) can now be written together in full:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.51)
     @xmath      (1.52)
     @xmath      (1.53)
     @xmath      (1.54)
     @xmath      (1.55)
     @xmath      (1.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the reaction term @xmath is given by ( 1.40 ). These equations
must be supplemented by suitable initial conditions and boundary
conditions, which depend on the configuration and will be specified in
future chapters.
