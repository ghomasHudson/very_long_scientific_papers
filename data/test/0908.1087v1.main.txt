## I Overview of nonlinear dynamics with relevance to plasma physics

### i.1 Introduction

Nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory started with the intention of
investigating the qualitative behavior of nonlinear problems which were
difficult to solve analytically. In the first half of the 1900s,
scientists were interested in nonlinear oscillators like the van der Pol
oscillator, and with the discovery of the high speed computers many
different nonlinear problems were solved book:strogatz . In 1963, Lorenz
book:lakshmanan introduced, the fluid convection model to study the
dynamics of the atmospheric weather, which exhibited chaotic behavior in
the numerical simulations and this model later came to be known as the
famous Lorenz model. It shows very complicated dynamics like chaos,
inverse period doubling bifurcation, etc., depending on the model
parameters. Chaos theory flourished when Reuelle and Takens
commathphys:ruelle proposed a new theory for the onset of turbulence in
the fluids and Gollub and Swinney verified it experimentally in a
concentric rotating cylinder using water, and it was observed that with
the increase in the rotation rate the radial velocity fluctuations went
to a chaotic state through a period doubling bifurcation, which were
analyzed using Fourier techniques prl:gollub . In the late 70s,
Feigenbaum discovered the universal constant called the Feigenbaum
constant to characterize the universal features of the period doubling
bifurcation jstatphys:feigenbaum . Later, bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov
exponent, correlation dimension, etc., derived on the basis of chaos
theory, have been used to characterize chaos and its different routes
physrevlett:grassberger ; PhysicaD:wolf ; physicaD:rosenstein . Since
the development of nonlinear dynamics, most applications have been in
the field of fluid dynamics, particularly fluid turbulence and since
fluid and plasma turbulence are closely related, the concepts of
nonlinear dynamics had been successfully utilized in plasmas.

In the late sixties and later, the idea of van der Pol oscillator was
applied to explain the growth and saturation of the plasma instabilities
which could not be done using conventional linear theories

physrev:Hsuan ; physfluids:hendel ; prl:keen ; physfluids:boswell ;
pop:pecseli ; pla:klinger ; pre:klinger ; pla:Gyergyek ; pla:Buragohain
; pla:Tavzes ; pop:Klostermann ; pop:Rohde ; pop:Koepke ; pre:Wendt ;
pscr:Klinger . Abrams et al. , first observed the nonlinear phenomena
like period pulling, frequency entrainment, etc., in periodically forced
self oscillatory plasmas prl:abrams . B.E. Keen, et al. , showed using a
two fluid model that the ion sound instabilities behaved in a manner
similar to a van der Pol oscillator when subjected to a driving force
jphysDAppl:keen . By the mid eighties researchers began looking for
experimental evidences of deterministic chaos in plasmas.
Experimentally, the period doubling bifurcation and chaotic behavior
were observed in an electron beam plasma system in 1984, wherein,
Boswell showed that the natural oscillations on an electron beam
propagating parallel to a magnetic field, went through a period doubling
bifurcation to a chaotic state with increase in the beam current
ppcf:boswell . The period doubling route to chaos was also reported in
the driven pulsed filament discharge plasma and an electrical discharge
tube prl:Cheung ; prl:braun . In 1989, the intermittency route to a
chaos was observed in the low frequency self oscillations in the
undriven DC discharge system chinesepl:yong ; prl:Qin . Homoclinic chaos
prl:braun1 was reported in the same electrical discharge plasma system
in which the deterministic chaos had been observed by T. Braun, et al. ,
Quasiperiodic route to chaos was observed in the driven and undriven
discharge plasmas prl:Qin ; physletta:Fan ; prl:Weixing in magnetic
multipole devices physletta:Fan ; prl:Weixing . Period adding route to
chaos and period subtracting had been observed in ion beam plasma in
double plasma device ijbc:sharma . Other nonlinear phenomena like mode
locking, period pulling, frequency entrainments etc., had been observed
by Klinger et al pop:Klinger ; pla:klinger ; pre:klinger ; prl:abrams ;
georl:Koepke ; book:Koepke ; book:Koepke1 ; georl:Lashinsky . In arc
plasma chaos have been observed by S. Ghorui, et al. , pre:ghorui ;
pre:ghorui1 ; pre:ghorui2 . In many other experiments almost similar
phenomena had been observed where different types of gases, geometric
configurations and parametric regimes were explored prl:Ding ; IEEE:ref4
; pop:Hassouba ; EurPhysJD:Atipo ; pop:lee1 . In all the above
experiments the common feature was that the plasma dynamics goes towards
a chaotic state as the discharge current or discharge voltage (DV) was
raised.

On the other hand, inverse route, i.e., chaos to ordered state
transition has not been observed experimentally in plasmas. Possibility
of such a route in plasma sheath had been shown by Tomejiro Yamagishi
and Makoto Tsukayama jpsj:makato1 numerically, where dissipation was
important to lead to such situations. Generally, with dissipation or
decrease in the input energy, the system goes to an ordered state. In
our experiments the chaotic behavior of the floating potential
fluctuations generated during the creation of an anode glow, goes to a
regular state with increasing the discharge voltage. This happens
because with increase in DV, the glow vanishes and hence the system
becomes stable and this has been discussed in detail in Section III .

With the advent of nonlinear dynamics, many other interesting phenomena
like controlling chaos prl:ott , noise induced resonances JPhysA:benzi1
, synchronization of chaotic system prl:pecora , quantum chaos, etc.,
have been observed. Some of these phenomena are also observed in plasma,
specially coherence resonance near Hopf bifurcation was studied by Lin I
and Jeng-Mei Liu prl:Lin I1 and A. Dinklage, et al. pop:dinklage1 . Our
experiments have been very conducive for investigation both stochastic
and coherence resonance phenomena and have been discussed in Section IV
. We are presenting results of both types of resonances in the glow
discharge plasmas near homoclinic bifurcation in Section IV .

### i.2 Time series analysis

The instabilities that we have studied in this thesis were recorded in
the form of time dependent floating potential fluctuations. To
understand the characteristics of the instabilities, one has to analyze
the fluctuations using the time series analysis which has been given
here.

A time series is a sequence of data points of an observed variable at
equally spaced time intervals and time series analysis comprises of
methods that attempt to understand such time series, often either to
understand the underlying context of the data points (where did they
come from? what generated them?), or to make forecasts (predictions).
Applications cover virtually all areas of statistics, but some of the
most important ones include economic and financial time series,
analyzing and modeling and forecasting of physical time series
(hydrology, earth sciences, astronomy, oceanography and biology,
astrophysics, plasma, etc.), simulation of time series models and
examination of their properties, filtering and smoothing of any type of
time series, statistical estimation of parameters of the time series
models, either linear or nonlinear, with several types of optimization
methods, etc.

The objectives of a time series analysis are diverse, depending on the
background of applications. Statisticians whose fundamental task is to
unveil the probability law that governs the observed time series,
usually view them as a realization from a stochastic process, With such
a probability law, we can understand the underlying dynamics, forecast
future events, and control them via suitable intervention. Time series
analysis can be categorized in two classes: linear and nonlinear time
series analysis. Methods for linear time series analysis are often
divided into two classes: frequency-domain and time-domain methods. The
former are spectral and wavelet analysis while the latter consists of
estimating the auto-correlation and cross-correlation in the time
series.

Linear analysis tools treat all the irregular or chaotic behavior as a
stochastic processes though these instabilities may be generated by
deterministic dynamics. Very often, we also encounter such systems which
have no model and and one has to study such a system from a single
observable. So to overcome this lacking feature of the linear analysis
and to analyze complex system, one needs resort nonlinear dynamics
approach especially chaos theory. The most direct link between chaos
theory and the real world is the analysis of the time series from real
systems in terms of nonlinear dynamics book:Kantz . Based on chaos
theory, nonlinear tools have been developed to characterize such
complicated data. The scope of these methods ranges from invariants such
as Lyapunov exponents, correlation dimensions, etc.
physrevlett:grassberger ; PhysicaD:wolf ; physicaD:rosenstein , which
yield an accurate description of the structure of the system to
statistical tools which allow for classification and diagnosis even in
situations where determinism is not obvious.

We have used both types of analysis techniques (linear and nonlinear) to
analyze the time series data obtained from our experiments, because some
features that could not be revealed by one type of technique was
possible by the other. A detailed discussion on the data analysis
techniques has been presented in Section II.3 of Section II .

## Ii Experiment, diagnostics, and data analysis procedures

### ii.1 Experiment

The experiments were carried out in a glow discharge argon plasma
produced by a dc discharge in a cylindrical hollow cathode electrode
system with a typical density and temperature @xmath and @xmath eV
respectively. The schematic diagram of the electrode system is shown in
Fig. 1 and its detail is presented in Subsection II.1.1 . The electrode
assembly was housed inside a vacuum chamber as shown in Fig. 2 . The
neutral pressure inside the vacuum chamber was controlled by a needle
valve and the range of the gas pressure in these experiments were
between 0.001 to a few mbar. The discharge voltage ( @xmath V) was
applied between the cathode and the anode keeping the anode grounded. A
noise (HP33120A) and a signal generator (Fluke PM5138A) were coupled
with the power supply for the noise induced experiments. The main
diagnostics was the Langmuir probe (described in Subsection II.2.1 )
used to obtain the floating potential fluctuations. In these experiments
the discharge voltage (DV) and pressure were the control parameters.
Fig. 3 is the laboratory view of the whole experimental system and the
details of the various parts are presented below.

By varying the neutral pressure ( @xmath ), the breakdown of the gas
occurs at different DV as shown in Fig 4 . The breakdown voltage (
@xmath ) initially decreases with increase in @xmath , (where, d is the
radius of the cathode) and then begins to increase with @xmath after
going through a minimum value resembling a typical Paschen curve
chaos:nurujjaman ; book:von . This curve classifies the operating
regions of @xmath and DV for the experiments presented in this thesis.
When the discharge has been operated for pressures greater than the
Paschen minimum, the floating potential fluctuations show chaos to an
ordered state transition and has been discussed in Section
LABEL:Section:chaos and for less than the Paschen minimum, fluctuations
show self organized criticality behavior and has been discussed in
Section VI . Chaos to an ordered state transition is related to the
formation of an anode glow or an anode spot on the anode
chaos:nurujjaman ; JphysD:song ; ppcf:sanduloviciu . Evolution of the
glow was monitored by a CCD camera. The ordered state, i.e., when the
floating potential is in a steady state which is basically an excitable
state is very useful to perform noise invoked resonance experiments and
has been presented in Section IV .

The detail descriptions of the different parts of the experimental setup
have been given in the following subsections.

#### ii.1.1 Electrode system

The experiment has been carried out in a hollow cathode cylindrical
electrode system as shown in Fig 5 and schematic diagram in Fig. 1 . Fig
5 (A) and 5 (B) are the side and front view of the electrode system
respectively. The outer stainless steel (SS) cylinder [Fig 5 (c)] is the
cathode and the inner SS cylindrical rod placed concentrically with the
cathode [Fig 5 (d)] is the anode. Cathode was kept covered with the
nylon [Fig 5 (e)]. Electrical connections have been given to the
electrodes by two connectors shown in Figs 5 (a1) and (a2). Almost all
the experiments have been carried out using a cathode of diameter 45 mm.

#### ii.1.2 Vacuum Chamber

SS304 vacuum chamber consists of three parts, bottom flange, main
cylindrical body and upper flange [Fig. 2 ]. The diameter of the upper
and bottom flanges are 300 mm each and height of 300 mm. We have used
two upper flanges. It consists of two NW16 coupling through which a gas
inlet valve and a Pirani gauge have been connected and few NW25 coupling
for inserting electrode system, probes etc. The bottom flange has a
pumping port. The whole chamber is installed on an MS stand [Fig. 3 ].
There are four side ports each of diameter 200 mm. These ports may be
covered using toughened glass or blank flanges or other suitable flanges
fitted with diagnostics.

#### ii.1.3 Power supply

Discharge voltage has been supplied to the electrode system by a dc
power supply [Figs. 2 and 3 ]. It is a variable power supply of range
0-999 V and maximum output current is 1 amp. Over current protection and
short circuit protection are available.

#### ii.1.4 Pumping System

The pumping system is a mechanical rotary pump provided by Hind High
Vacuum, Bangalore. This pump has been mounted on the bed of a MS table
[Fig. 3 ]. The vacuum chamber is connected to the rotary pump through an
SS bellow followed by a butterfly valve. During pumping the butterfly
valve is kept open, and closed when the system is not under operation.
The Pirani gauge head is connected on the top flange of the chamber to
measure the pressure.

### ii.2 Diagnostics

#### ii.2.1 Langmuir probe

A Langmuir probe is a conductor introduced in the plasma to measure
density, floating potential fluctuations, etc. It consists of a
cylindrical tungsten wire of diameter 0.5 mm of length @xmath mm [Fig. 6
]. A teflon coated stainless steel wire has been soldered to the
tungsten wire, and it has been fitted inside a glass tube as shown in
Fig. 6 . The exposed tungsten wire of 2 mm length, outside the glass
tube is the effective measuring area of the probe. It has been inserted
in the plasma through a side port by NW25 coupling and has the facility
of axial movement. When it is inserted in the plasma, the electrons and
ions fall on it. The imbalance between the ion and electron current, due
to the fact that the electrons have a higher mobility between the two,
results in an accumulation of the electrons on the surface of the probe,
setting up an electric field. This electric field repels the electrons
and attracts ions towards the probe so that the net current is zero and
hence the surface acquires a negative potential, which is called
floating potential ( @xmath ). In the present experiments, the floating
potential and its fluctuations have been measured using a tektronix
digital oscilloscope.

#### ii.2.2 CCD Camera

Ionization and excitation are both important in glow discharge plasmas.
The excitation, followed by de-excitations with the emission of
radiation, is responsible for the appearance of glow. Depending upon
different plasma parameters, the size of the glow changes and hence the
evolution of it, is an useful observable for the study of the nonlinear
behavior of the glow discharge plasma. The evolution of the glow has
been monitored using a black & white CCD camera shown in Fig 7 . Size of
the anode glow has been estimated from the pixel size of the digital
image taken by this camera. Detailed specifications of the camera have
been given in Table 1 .

### ii.3 Data analysis techniques

The analysis of the floating potential fluctuations has been carried out
using the linear and nonlinear time series analysis. In linear analysis,
power spectrum, autocorrelation, probability density function, etc., and
in nonlinear analysis Lyapunov exponent, correlation dimension, Hurst
exponent, etc., have been used. Some statistical tools like ‘normal
variance’ and ‘absolute mean difference’ have also been used to
characterize coherence and stochastic resonances. The analysis has been
carried out in time as well as frequency domain. Some basics of time
series analysis techniques and the procedures followed for computation
have been presented in the following subsections.

#### ii.3.1 Power spectral method

A time series which has a certain periodicity may be represented as a
superposition of periodic components of sines and cosines. The
determination of their relative strengths is basically known as spectral
or Fourier analysis. When the time series is periodic, the spectrum may
be expressed as a linear combination of oscillations whose frequencies
are integer multiples of the basic frequency which is the Fourier
series. In order to find the characteristic modes, and the dominant mode
present in the floating potential fluctuations, power spectral method
has been used. It can also be used to explore other characteristic
features present in a time series, such as, self organized criticality
behavior, wherein, power spectra shows a power law behavior and it has
been discussed in chapter LABEL:chapter:soc . Power spectrum has been
calculated using fast Fourier transform method using MATLAB, which has
been given below.

f = z*(0:( @xmath )/2)/( @xmath );
pyy=py(1:( @xmath )/2+1);

#### ii.3.2 Autocorrelation

The autocorrelation time of a fluctuating signal is a measure of the
temporal coherence and is obtained from the autocorrelation of the
signal. For a time series of length n, @xmath , the autocorrelation
function (ACF) can be written as PhysicaA:Davide

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (1)
  -- -------- -- -----

where @xmath , and @xmath are the mean, and time lag of the time series
respectively. If there is long-range time dependence in the signal, then
the algebraic decay of the ACF can be written as PRE:GRangarajan2

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (2)
  -- -------- -- -----

for large @xmath , where @xmath .

Presence of power law decay of the tail of the ACF indicates the
presence of long range correlation in the time series that is one of the
characteristic behavior of the self organized criticality [Section VI ].
Autocorrelation also gives the good estimate of the time delay of
embedding in the phase space that will be discussed in the next
sections. It has been calculated using MATLAB in-built function ‘ xcorr
’.

#### ii.3.3 Phase space plot

In order to observe nonlinear structures present in a time series and to
estimate the correlation dimension, Lyapunov exponent, etc.[subsections
II.3.4 and II.3.5 ], the time series has to be described in a suitable
phase space. The phase space description provides a powerful tool for
describing the behavior of a time series in a geometric form. As in the
real experiments, the observable is the sequence of scalar measurements,
and one need to reconstruct phase space vectors from these scalar
observable. This can be done by method of delay.

From a time series @xmath , where N is the total number of points, the m
dimensional vector in the phase space can be constructed by delay
embedding physicaD:rosenstein ; physreports:schreiber ; physicaD:judd ;
physrevlett:packard ; sringer:takens

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (3)
  -- -------- -- -----

The time difference ( @xmath ) between two consecutive components of the
delay vectors [Eqn. 3 ] is referred to as the lag or time delay . The
minimum embedding dimension (m) should be greater than @xmath for good
reconstruction of delay vector, where, @xmath is the box counting
dimension of the attractor. A good estimate of @xmath is more difficult
to obtain. As in the mathematical sense, embeddings with the same m but
with different @xmath are equivalent for noise free data, but in the
real case the reconstructed dynamics depends upon @xmath . There are
several rules to choose a time delay. A good time delay may be chosen as
@xmath , of the autocorrelation of the initial value book:Kantz . Then
the reconstructed trajectory of the actual dynamics can be written as
@xmath , where @xmath . This trajectory is useful to estimate the
correlation dimension and Lyapunov exponents that have been discussed in
the next subsections.

#### ii.3.4 Correlation dimension

The correlation dimension of a time series is defined as the
dimensionality of the space occupied by the points of that time series.
It can be estimated from the correlation integral of the reconstructed
trajectory in phase space [subsection LABEL:subsection:phase ] of the
time series. The correlation integral can be computed using following
equation physrevlett:grassberger ; physicaD:rosenstein ; book:Kantz ;
physrevA:grassberger

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (4)
  -- -------- -- -----

where, @xmath is scale length, and @xmath is the Heaviside step
function. @xmath , @xmath will be obtained using Equation 3 .

The scaling of the function @xmath can be written as

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (5)
  -- -------- -- -----

where @xmath is the Correlation dimension defined as

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (6)
  -- -------- -- -----

and can be obtained from the slope of @xmath vs @xmath plot. We have
used the algorithm written by Rosenstein in C for computing correlation
dimensions.

#### ii.3.5 Lyapunov exponent

Chaotic dynamical systems are sensitive to initial conditions, and
exhibit an exponential divergence in the phase space. The divergence can
be quantified by an exponent called Lyapunov exponent. There are several
methods to estimate Lyapunov exponent. Here Rosenstein method has been
used, because this method is very useful for short data length.

If we consider two points on two nearby trajectories of a chaotic
attractor, in the phase space, assuming the distance between them to be
@xmath , and after time t, if the distance between the two trajectories
becomes @xmath , then the divergence (separation after time t) can be
written as physicaD:rosenstein

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (7)
  -- -------- -- -----

where @xmath is the largest Lyapunov exponent. Since a practical time
series is basically a scalar measurement, the largest @xmath can be
estimated from the reconstructed trajectories in the phase space. Now if
@xmath and @xmath are the @xmath pair of the nearest neighbor on two
nearby reconstructed trajectories of that time series in the phase space
and distance between them is @xmath , then the separation after time
@xmath , where @xmath is the sampling time, can be written as

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (8)
  -- -------- -- -----

where @xmath is the initial separation. The above equation can be
written as

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (9)
  -- -------- -- -----

and the largest @xmath can be calculated from the slope of the average
line defined by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (10)
  -- -------- -- ------

@xmath quantifies the chaotic nature of the fluctuation, and +Ve @xmath
indicates the presence of chaos. It has been calculated using the
algorithm developed by Rosenstein in C.

#### ii.3.6 Surrogate method

The interest in detecting determinism or stochasticity in time series
arose out of the need to discriminate a chaotic time series from a
random one. To do this one has to first generate surrogate time series
from the original time series using some specific rules which is termed
as surrogate method. Once the property under investigation (for instance
nonlinearity, determinism, and so on) is defined, a method is sought to
generate the surrogate data that preserves a specific characteristic of
the original time series. A discriminant factor is then used to compare
the original time series with the time series generated by a suitably
chosen surrogate method. If there are significant difference between the
discriminating factors obtained from the two time series, then one can
say that the original is not random.

Several algorithms have been proposed to generate the surrogate data in
the literature. The most commonly used methods are: Random Shuffled,
phase shuffled and Amplitude Adjusted Fourier shuffled methods
physicaD:theiler ; ieee:small ; Bifur:Nakamura . We have used phase
shuffled method for our experimental data. The correlation dimension has
been used as the discriminating factor. The phases of the original time
series have been randomized by Phase Shuffled method, by shuffling the
fourier phases physicaD:theiler ; Bifur:Nakamura ; chaos:dori . This
method preserves the power spectrum (linear structure), but the
nonlinear structures are destroyed Bifur:Nakamura . Now if the original
time series has some kinds of nonlinearity, the correlation dimension
estimated from the both times series will differ significantly and hence
useful to detect determinism present in the time series. The algorithm
written by Michael Small using MATLAB has been used to generate the
surrogate data and the codes may be found in his web page.

#### ii.3.7 Hurst exponent

The rescaled-range statistics @xmath method was proposed by Hurst and
well established by Mandelbrot, and Wallis POP:carreras . For the time
series defined above [subsection LABEL:subsection:phase ], the @xmath is
defined as POP:carreras the ratio of the maximal range of the integrated
signal normalized to the standard deviation:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (11)
  -- -------- -- ------

Here @xmath , where @xmath , @xmath , and n are respectively the mean,
variance, and time lag of the signal. The expected value of @xmath
scales like @xmath as @xmath , where H is called the Hurst exponent. For
random data H=0.5, while @xmath for the data with long range
correlations. @xmath indicates the presence of long-range
anti-correlation in the data.

Presence of long range correlation in a time series can be estimated
using Hurst exponent. The algorithm for estimating Hurst exponent was
written in MATLAB.

#### ii.3.8 Normal variance

Normal variance (NV) has been used to quantify the regularity in the
signal recovered by introducing noise in the plasma. NV prl:pikovsky is
defined as @xmath where, @xmath the standard deviation of the peak to
peak distance ( @xmath ) of the recovered signal. If the distribution of
the peaks are regular NV is small and hence it is the estimation of the
coherency present in the system. NV has been calculated using algorithm
written in MATLAB.

#### ii.3.9 Amd

Absolute mean difference (AMD) pre:nurujjaman is the statistical tool,
proposed to quantify the stochastic resonance in a plasma subjected to
noise and a periodic signal. AMD is defined as @xmath , and gives AMD
gives the degree of mimicking the output to the input subthreshold
signal. Usually, regularity in the stochastic resonance is quantified by
calculating cross-correlation ( @xmath ) between the output and input
signal. But in case of plasma it is not suitable, because there is
always a lag between periodic signal that is applied to the plasma and
the output. This lag also varies with time because the plasma conditions
keep fluctuating over time. Therefore, cross-correlation is not the
right quantity to be estimated. So we have proposed a statistical tool
AMD which will be independent of lag and is estimated as follows:

1.  First calculate the mean inter-peak distance ( @xmath ) of the
    periodic signal.

2.  Calculate the inter-peak distances ( @xmath ) of the output signal.

3.  Calculate the ( @xmath )

4.  Take the absolute, i.e., @xmath .

Therefore, @xmath .

The algoritm for AMD is almost identical of Normal variance.

## Iii Chaos to order and homoclinic bifurcation in glow discharge
plasma

### iii.1 Introduction

In the first chapter, we had mentioned that in almost all the chaos
related plasma experiments, plasma fluctuations were observed to go to a
chaotic state with external control parameters, like discharge voltage,
currents, etc. On the other hand, there has been no experimental
evidence of inverse routes, i.e., chaos to order. It has only been seen
numerically in plasma by Tomejiro Yamagishi and Makoto Tsukayama
jpsj:makato1 . In the present experiment, we have reported chaos to an
ordered state transition for a particular range of plasma parameters
given by the Paschen curve which has been discussed in Section II.1 of
Section II . For those pressure regions, with the initiation of
discharge, a bright glow or spot [Fig 8 ] was observed to form on the
anode that was unstable initially and was the source of the chaotic
fluctuations . So to understand the dynamics of the anode glow one needs
to analyze the floating potential fluctuations that has been discussed
in next Subsection III.2 . Nonlinear analysis of the fluctuation has
been carried by estimating the correlation dimension and the Lyapunov
exponent.

### iii.2 Anode glow

Anode glow is a bright structure or spot of higher plasma density,
producing anode double layer by additional excitation and ionization
process and forms around an anode or any point on the anode or on a
positively biased probe JphysD:song ; ppcf:sanduloviciu ; psst:stenzel ;
chaossolitonfractal:agop ; epl:popescu ; applphysD:Song ; Phys.Scr.:Song
; Phys.Scr.:Song1 ; pla:sanduloviciu ; pla:Sanduloviciu1 ; ppcf:Amemiya
. It appears when the discharge current is too low to sustain the
discharge JphysD:song ; ppcf:sanduloviciu . Its size and shape differ
depending upon the plasma conditions. It is related to highly nonlinear
phenomena involving the physics of sheaths, double layers, ionization,
beam and possibly external circuit interactions.

Figs 8 (a) shows that the glow with largest size, appears when the
discharge is struck at a typical pressure of 0.95 mbar and its size
decreases with increase in the DV until it finally disappears [Figs 8
(a) @xmath 8 (h)]. From the CCD image analysis the annular radius of the
glow around the anode, was estimated to be @xmath mm at the beginning of
the discharge [Fig 8 (a)] and reduced to @xmath mm [Fig 8 (f)].

Theoretically one can obtain an expression for the thickness ( @xmath )
following Bin Song et al. JphysD:song . The rate of ion production in
the sheath is approximately,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where, @xmath , @xmath and N are the electron density, mass and neutral
density respectively. @xmath is the positive voltage created inside the
anode, @xmath the thickness of the glow, @xmath the ionization
cross-section depends upon the energy of the electron and at 15.76 eV,
@xmath is @xmath jchemphys:rapp .

The rate of ion loss from the glow is approximately,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where, @xmath , @xmath are ion mass and density respectively.

Balancing the ion loss with the ion production, and invoking the
condition that @xmath , we obtain

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

or

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (12)
  -- -------- -- ------

where k, T, and P are the Boltzmann constant, room temperature in Kelvin
scale, and pressure in mbar respectively. The estimated thickness of the
anode glow using the Eqn. 12 , for @xmath mbar, @xmath K, is @xmath mm
which is within the range of the thickness estimated from the image (
@xmath mm) shown in Fig 8 .

Fig 9 (a) and 9 (b) show the tentative model of floating potential
profile for the present experimental arrangement. It shows that the
floating potential increases sharply in the sheath region near the
cathode and then decreases slowly up to the anode. As the measurement
near the anode and the cathode was not possible, the extrapolated
potential profile is shown by dash lines. In the the presence of the
anode glow, the potential near the anode get modified. Experimentally it
is observed that the anode glow is separated from rest of the plasma by
a double layer JphysD:song ; ppcf:sanduloviciu ; JphysD:opresu ;
pla:sanduloviciu and the height of the potential of the core of this
glow is of the order of the ionization potential JphysD:opresu , which
for argon is about 15.76 eV. As the anode is grounded, the modified
potential profile in this case, over the profile shown in Fig 9 (a),
will be as shown in Fig 9 (b). As the width of the anode glow decreases
with increase in the DVs [Fig 8 ] the hump shown in Fig 9 (b) will also
shrink accordingly. This shrinkage happens because as the electron
energy increases with the DVs, the necessity of the additional
ionization to maintain the discharge decreases JphysD:song . Based on
the observation of Valentin Pohoaţǎ, et al. pre:Valentin , we feel that
the relaxation oscillations are double layer or such coherent potential
structures, which are constantly forming and annihilating.

### iii.3 Analysis of the floating potential fluctuations

#### iii.3.1 Chaos to order

An interesting feature associated with the anode glow was the different
types of oscillations in the floating potential at different pressures.

We carried out a detailed analysis of the fluctuations for three typical
pressures which are presented here. At about 0.89 mbar ( @xmath
mbar-mm), the discharge was initiated at @xmath V and an anode glow was
observed similar to Fig 8 (a).

Simultaneously irregular relaxation type of oscillations in the floating
potential were observed [Fig 10 (a)]. Increasing the DVs, led to an
increase both in the amplitude and the time period of the oscillations
[Figs 10 (b) @xmath 10 (i)]. The regularity of the oscillation also
increases with the DVs. Around 509 V both the anode glow and the
fluctuations disappeared simultaneously and this point is termed as
bifurcation point or critical point ( @xmath ). At 0.95 mbar ( @xmath
mbar-mm) the fluctuations are observed to be more random [Fig 11 (a)
@xmath (i)] than at 0.89 mbar. With increasing DV, the final form of the
fluctuations before their disappearance was the relaxation type of
oscillation as shown in Figs 11 (h) @xmath 11 (i). Increasing the
pressure causes more randomness in the signals as seen in Fig 12 (a)
@xmath (i) at 1.0 mbar ( @xmath mbar-mm). We observed the relaxation
type of oscillations at DV @xmath V just before the glow and the
fluctuation disappears. So in general, the autonomous dynamics shows
transition from oscillatory to steady state behavior.

Linear analysis:

To understand the nature of the fluctuations we have analyzed them using
Fourier techniques. Figs 13 {I}, {II} and {III} show the power spectrum
chaos:nurujjaman ; pramana:nurujjaman calculated for the signals at
three different experimental pressures shown in Figs 10 , 11 and 12
respectively.

A broad range of frequencies ( @xmath ion plasma frequency) is observed
at the initial stage of the discharge, at pressures 0.89 mbar [Fig 13
{I} (a)], 0.95 mbar [Fig 13 {II} (a)] and 1.0 mbar [Fig 13 {III} (a)
@xmath (b)]. The figures also show that with increasing DV, number of
peaks present in the power spectrum, decreases. At higher DV, i.e., at
the end of the sequence of the power spectra we observed one major peak
with its harmonic [Figs 13 {I}(f) @xmath (i) and III(i)] or two peaks
[Figs 13 {II}(i)] just before the fluctuations cease. The power spectra
clearly show that the system goes from an irregular to a more or less
regular state with increasing DV. Another interesting feature that has
been observed for all the three pressures is that the dominant
frequency, i.e., the frequency which has maximum power decreases with
increase in the DVs [Figs 14 (a) @xmath (c)]. On the contrary, in many
experiments pop:Klinger ; pop:lee ; ppcf:gyergyek , the dominant
frequency is observed to increase with the DV. The basic difference
between the present experiment and the experiments performed in Ref
pop:Klinger ; pop:lee ; ppcf:gyergyek was in the electrode configuration
and biasing arrangement. In those experiments pop:Klinger ; pop:lee ;
ppcf:gyergyek the system was planar type is which the anode voltage was
increased keeping the cathode at ground whereas ours is a cylindrical
system in which we increased the negative voltage on the cathode keeping
anode at ground. In those systems electrons originating at cathode get
lost at the anode. In our case the electrons can undergo multiple
reflections and hence increases the ionization length. The fluctuations
are probably due to ion acoustic instability driven by electron beam
plasma interaction and also from electron and ion trapping in the
potential wells. associated with the anode glow [Fig 9 ].

Ions produced inside the anode glow due to collisions of the accelerated
electrons across the hump with the neutrals, makes the glow unstable
ppcf:sanduloviciu , which is probably responsible for the relaxation or
the random oscillations pop:Klinger ; pop:lee . An estimate of the
frequency of these instabilities can be obtained from the ion transit
time in the plasma pop:Klinger @xmath , where d is the electrode
distance. The estimated ion transit frequency ( @xmath ) for our
experimental system is @xmath kHz which agrees well with the frequency
of the relaxation oscillations of the floating potential shown in Figs
13 {I}(f) @xmath (i), {II}(i) and {III}(i). The higher frequency
oscillations could be due to ion acoustic instabilities since the
conditions are quite conducive to excite these low frequency
instabilities. In the next subsection we have presented nonlinear
analysis of the fluctuations.

Nonlinear analysis:

The presence of relaxation oscillations have been attributed to the
formation of highly nonlinear structures like double layers pre:Valentin
. We therefore estimated the correlation dimension ( @xmath ) and the
+ve Lyapunov exponent ( @xmath ) of all the signals. In this experiment,
it is observed that the nature of the fluctuations of the potential did
not vary for almost the whole day as long as the controlling parameters
are kept constant, so the analyzed signals can conveniently be taken to
be stationary.

The correlation dimension ( @xmath ) has been calculated using
well-known Grassberger-Procaccia techniques physrevlett:grassberger ;
physrevA:grassberger , and detail has been discussed in Subsection II.3
of Section II . A typical plot of @xmath vs @xmath has been shown in Fig
15 for the embedding dimension (m), in the range of 2 to 10, from which
we have estimated the correlation dimension ( @xmath ) for a typical
signal (Fig 11 (a)) at DV @xmath V, at 0.95 mbar. The scaling region had
to be chosen carefully, since for too small scale lengths the
correlation sum is heavily distorted by noise and the higher scale
lengths are limited by attractor dimensions. From the above plot the
correlation sum exhibits a power law behavior within a certain range of
@xmath as shown by the vertical dotted line. @xmath vs @xmath plots are
almost parallel for higher m (i.e. @xmath ) and the corresponding best
fit has been shown by @xmath line. @xmath vs m is also shown in the
inset of Fig 15 . It shows that @xmath becomes constant at higher m and
this constant value of @xmath is the correlation dimension of that
particular signal and for all of our data @xmath to begin with. The
@xmath at 0.89, 0.95 and 1 mbar for different DVs have been shown by
open circle( @xmath ) in Figs 16 (a) @xmath 16 (c) respectively. It is
observed that there is a decreasing tendency of @xmath except for some
intermediate values of DV at higher pressures, where it is seen to
increase and then decrease again. Since @xmath is a measure of the
complexity of the system it is likely that the system complexity
increases at those intermediate DVs. In our experiment initially the
system is in a complex state as @xmath for all the three pressures is
high and decreases with increase in DVs [Fig 16 (a) @xmath (c)]. @xmath
just before the system reaches stable state finally, is the indicator of
the periodic state and these periodic nature are also prominent from the
raw data and the power spectrum [Figs 10 , 11 , 12 and Fig 13 {I} @xmath
{III}]. @xmath shows that the system stabilizes itself with increase in
DVs.

The presence of a +ve Lyapunov exponent ( @xmath ) is the most reliable
signature of the chaotic dynamics and it is estimated using the
Rosestein algorithm physicaD:rosenstein which has been discussed in
Subsection II.3 of Section II . Fig. 17 shows @xmath vs @xmath for m=2
to 10. A clear scaling region is seen at a higher m shown by @xmath
line. The positive @xmath has been identified at 0.95 and 1 mbar for
some DVs and they are shown in Fig 16 (b) and 16 (c) by +ve sign
respectively. Figs 16 (b) and (c) show that @xmath becomes positive for
283, 284, and 290 V at 0.95 mbar and for 293, 296, 300 and 305 V at 1
mbar respectively. Though @xmath quantifies the complexity present in
the system, it does not guarantee the presence of chaos, which is
determined by @xmath . At 0.89 mbar initially we have a high @xmath [Fig
16 (a)], but the @xmath is not positive in this case, implying that the
system is not in chaotic state. At higher pressures we find that in
general @xmath is +ve @xmath , suggesting a low dimensional chaos.

@xmath and @xmath have been estimated for different data lengths to
check the error on the estimations of the @xmath and @xmath . The
estimated @xmath and @xmath at different data lengths have been shown in
Table 2 . Both and @xmath and @xmath tend to show stable results for
higher data lengths (larger than 1000) as seen from Table 2 .

In order to validate the above observations, we carried out the
surrogate data analysis using phase shuffled method that has been
described in Subsection II.3 of Section II . seen in Fig 18 (c) The
@xmath for the original data saturates at higher m, whereas for the
surrogate data it increases with m as expected, since the surrogate data
is supposed to be random in nature, and its @xmath should be infinite
chaos:dori . The saturation of @xmath in our case indicates that the
system dynamics is deterministic in nature.

We also carried out a wavelet analysis of the fluctuations at 0.95 mbar
and obtained the presence of chaos. The ridge plot method (Chandre, et
al. physicaD:Chandre3 ) clearly shows that the presence of many ridges
[Fig 19 (a)] indicating that at the initial stage of DV (283 V) the
system is chaotic physicaD:Chandre3 , whereas at 284 V [Fig 19 (b)] the
system is weakly chaotic as only few ridges are present. With increase
in DV the system becomes almost regular in nature [Fig 19 (b) @xmath
(e)] where ridges are approximately constant with time. But at 290 V
[Fig 19 (f)] abrupt change in frequency, i.e., presence of transient
features suggest that these are the effect of nonlinearity present in
the system BAMS:Lau . From the multifractal analysis
lecturenotes:nurujjaman we obtained the @xmath which is shown in Fig. 20
( @xmath ). This agrees quite well with the @xmath [open circle in Fig.
20 ] using Grassberger-Procaccia techniques physrevlett:grassberger ;
physrevA:grassberger .

#### iii.3.2 Homoclinic bifurcation

In Subsection III.3.1 , we have reported that the fluctuations show
relaxation type oscillations near the bifurcation point.

The time period (T) of these relaxation oscillations increases with
increasing DV near the bifurcation point. This eventually results in the
vanishing of the limit cycle behavior beyond a critical DV ( @xmath ).
For larger values of DV, the autonomous dynamics exhibit a steady state
fixed point behavior. Time traces from top to bottom in the left panel
of Fig 21 depict this period lengthening of the oscillatory behavior. A
systematic analysis of the increment in the period (T), presented in
Fig. 21 (a) [right panel], indicates that the autonomous dynamics
undergo a exponential slowing down. Consequently, the @xmath vs T curve
can be fitted by a straight line, where @xmath is the bifurcation point
separating the oscillatory domain and the steady state behavior. The
results of Fig 21 indicate that the system dynamics undergo a homoclinic
bifurcation pre:nurujjaman at @xmath resulting in the loss of
oscillations. The DV ( @xmath ) divides the plasma into two distinct
region, The floating potential fluctuation exhibits relaxation
oscillations on the one side of the @xmath and stable fixed point on the
other side, which is termed as being in an excitable state and is useful
to study noise invoked resonance effect in glow discharge plasma that
will be discussed in Section IV .

### iii.4 Conclusions

Glow discharges are simple systems which exhibit exotic features
depending on the configuration, initial parameters, etc. Since various
configurations are used in different applications like dusty plasma,
plasma processing, etc. it is necessary to understand the plasma
dynamics of these systems as much as possible. However the understanding
of the complexities in the plasma dynamics is quite a challenging job as
they arise from many degrees of freedom like different sources of free
energy, different types of wave particle interaction and many other
instabilities. In our present work nonlinear time series analysis has
been used to quantify and differentiate complex and coherent processes
at different parametric conditions. We also observed that the chaotic
state driven by the DV tends to be stabilized through homoclinic
bifurcation.

## Iv Stochastic and coherence resonance in glow discharge plasma

## V Introduction

Stochastic resonance (SR) which has been observed in many physical,
chemical and biological systems JPhysA:benzi ; arxiv:benzi ;
revmodphys:Gammaitoni ; prl:bruce ; pre:parmananda ; JStatPhys:moss ;
prl:longtin ; JPhysChem:foster ; JPhysChem:Amemiya ; prl:kitajo , is a
phenomenon in which the response of the nonlinear system to a weak
periodic input signal is amplified or optimized by the presence of a
particular level of noise JPhysA:benzi , i.e., a previously untraceable
subthreshold signal applied to a nonlinear system, can be detected in
the presence of noise. Furthermore, there exists an optimal level of
noise for which the most efficient detection takes place.

In 1981, Benzi and his coworkers, had introduced the idea of the SR to
model the existence of the 100k year cycle of occurrence of the ice age
and relatively warm age with a temperature difference of the order of
10K, which is surprisingly in phase with the Milankovitch cycle. They
successfully explained the phenomena, assuming a bistable system of the
global climate, to be separated by 10K temperature, the Milankovitch
cycle as a weak periodic forcing and the short term climate fluctuations
as noise, which has been discussed in Ref JPhysA:benzi ; arxiv:benzi ;
revmodphys:Gammaitoni .

In 1993, Gang, et al. prl:gang , and in 1994, Kurt Wiesenfeld, et al.
prl:wiesenfeld , had shown that SR is also possible in different classes
of dynamical systems based not on bistability but on excitable dynamics.
They proposed a system consisting of a potential barrier and above this
barrier the system shows deterministic dynamics (limit cycle
oscillation) and below, stable fixed point as illustrated in Fig 22 .

The figure shows that when the control parameter (potential) crosses the
PB, i.e., the potential is greater than PB, the system shows a limit
cycle behavior and when the potential is less than PB, the system
exhibits a stable fixed point behavior. Now if we set the control
parameter (potential) below the barrier and apply noise (stochastic
perturbation on the potential) to the system and whenever the barrier is
crossed, the system returns to its fixed point or “rest state”
deterministically prl:gang ; prl:wiesenfeld ; pre:strogatz , i.e.,
whenever the barrier is crossed, the system traverses one oscillation.
So for moderate noise level we can get back relatively coherent
oscillations, which is called coherence resonance (CR) prl:pikovsky5 .
Again when a subthreshold periodic signal in the form of pulse and noise
are added to the system below the potential barrier the probability of
crossing the barrier by noise at the time of occurrence of the periodic
pulse is maximum and hence one can get back deterministic dynamics in
the form of periodic oscillations of frequency of the applied periodic
pulse for optimum noise level which is the stochastic resonance of an
excitable system. So for excitable systems both SR and CR are possible.
Based upon excitability CR have been observed in plasma prl:Lin I ;
pop:dinklage , electronic circuits pre:postnov , optical systems
prl:Giacomelli ; prl:avila , and chemical systems pre:miyakawa ;
pre:istavan ; pre:Santos1 ; pre:revera and SR has been observed in
chemical systems pre:Santos1 , human brain and many other systems
revmodphys:Gammaitoni ; prl:kitajo .

Lin I and Jeng-Mei Liu prl:Lin I and A. Dinklage, et al. pop:dinklage ,
had studied CR in weakly ionized rf magnetoplasma and neon glow
discharge plasma based on excitable dynamics. In both the cases, the
excitability has been achieved through Hopf bifurcation for particular
parametric region of the discharge. In our experiments, we get excitable
dynamics, for certain discharge parameters, in the region greater than
the Paschen minimum, where the system exhibits selfsustained relaxation
oscillations, and change to excitable fixed point behavior with increase
in the DV, which has been discussed in Subsection III.3.2 of Section III
. The DV at which these oscillations cease may be termed the bifurcation
point ( @xmath ) which act as PB in this experiment. Near The @xmath ,
the time period of these relaxation oscillations increases dramatically
upon further incrementing DV. This eventually results in the vanishing
of the limit cycle behavior beyond the critical DV ( @xmath ) and
exhibits excitable dynamics through homoclinic bifurcation. So below
@xmath the system shows excitable behavior and useful to study noise
invoked resonance experiments, in these regions.

### v.1 Stochastic resonance

For our experiments on stochastic resonance, the reference voltage
@xmath was chosen such that @xmath and therefore the autonomous
dynamics, by virtue of an underlying homoclinic bifurcation, exhibit
steady state behavior. The discharge voltage @xmath was thereafter
perturbed @xmath , where @xmath is the subthreshold periodic pulse train
chosen for which @xmath , (subthreshold signal does not cause the system
to cross over to the oscillatory regime) and @xmath is the added
Gaussian white noise @xmath with amplitude @xmath . Subthreshold
periodic square pulse of width @xmath and duration 2 ms was constructed
using Fluke PM5138A function generator. Meanwhile, the gaussian noise
produced using the HP 33120A noise generator was subsequently amplified
using a noise amplifier.

Fig. 23 @xmath show time series of the system response in the presence
of an identical subthreshold signal for three different amplitudes of
imposed noise. The subthreshold periodic pulse train is also plotted, in
the top most graph of the left panel, for comparison purposes. Fig. 23
(a) shows that there is little correspondence between the subthreshold
signal and the system response for a low noise amplitude. However, there
is excellent correspondence at an intermediate noise amplitude [Fig. 23
(b)]. Finally, at higher amplitudes of noise the subthreshold signal is
lost amidst stochastic fluctuations of the system response [Fig. 23
(c)]. Absolute mean difference (AMD) which has been discussed in
Subsection II.3 of Section II , used to quantify the information
transfer between the subthreshold signal and the system response, is
defined as @xmath . @xmath and @xmath are the inter-peak interval of the
response signal and mean peak interval of the subthreshold periodic
signal respectively. Fig 23 (d) shows that the experimentally computed
AMD versus noise amplitude D curve has a unimodal structure typical for
the SR phenomena. The minima in this curve corresponds to the optimal
noise level for which maximum information transfer between the input and
the output takes place.

### v.2 Coherence resonance

For the experiments on coherence resonance DV @xmath ) was located such
that the floating potential fluctuations exhibit fixed point behavior.
In order to minimize the effect of parameter drift, a set-point ( @xmath
) quite far from the homoclinic bifurcation ( @xmath ) was chosen.
Subsequently, superimposed noise on the discharge voltage was increased
and the provoked dynamics analyzed. The normalized variance (NV) which
has been discussed in subsection II.3 of Section
LABEL:Section:experiment was used to quantify the extent of induced
regularity. It is defined as @xmath , where @xmath is the time elapsed
between successive peaks. It is evident that more regular the induced
dynamics the lower the value of the computed NV. For purely periodic
dynamics the NV goes to zero.

Fig. 24 @xmath (left panel) show the time series of the floating
potential fluctuations for different noise levels and Fig 24 (d) (right
panel) is the experimental NV curve as a function of noise amplitude D.
The point (a) in Fig 24 (d) (time series shown in Fig. 24 (a)) is
associated with a low level of noise where the activation threshold is
seldom crossed, generating a sparsely populated irregular spike
sequence. As the noise amplitude is increased, the NV decreases,
reaching a minimum (b) in Fig 24 (d) (time series shown in Fig. 24 (b))
corresponding to an optimum noise level where maximum regularity of the
generated spike sequence is observed. As the amplitude of superimposed
noise is increased further, the observed regularity is destroyed
manifested by an increase in the NV; label (c) in Fig 24 (d) (time
series shown in Fig. 24 (c)). This is a consequence of the dynamics
being dominated by noise.

### v.3 Discussion

The effect of noise has been studied experimentally near a homoclinic
bifurcation in glow discharge plasma system pre:nurujjaman . Our study
demonstrates the emergence of SR for periodic subthreshold square pulse
signals and the induction of CR via purely stochastic fluctuations. In
SR experiments, the efficiency of information transfer was quantified
using AMD instead of the power norm which has been utilized elsewhere
pre:parmananda . The advantage of using this method in comparison to the
power norm ( @xmath ) pre:parmananda lies in the fact that AMD remains
independent of the lag between the measured floating potential and the
applied periodic square pulse. This is of relevance to our experimental
system, where invariably there exists a lag, at times varying in time
due to the parameter drifts. Comparison between the estimated @xmath and
AMD have been shown in Fig 26 . It is obvious from Fig 26 ( @xmath )
that @xmath does not show any peak at optimum noise level. Whereas, AMD
shows nice agreement with regular spiking of the signal [Fig 26 ( @xmath
)]. For the CR experiments it was occasionally observed that while with
an initial increase in noise amplitude (D) NV reaches a minimum, the
subsequent rise of NV for even higher amplitudes of noise was suppressed
as shown in Fig 25 . This leads to the modification of the unimodal
profile, a signature of the CR phenomenon.

A possible explanation for this suppression is that by virtue of the
superimposed high frequency noise (bandwidth 500 KHz) and fast
responding internal plasma dynamics, the system has the capability of
exciting high frequency regular modes within the ion plasma frequency
(105 kHz). This in turn leads to the persistence of low NV values.
Finally, in Refs prl:Lin I ; pop:dinklage both the destructive and
constructive role of noise (CR only) have been reported for glow
discharge and magnetized rf discharge plasma systems respectively.
However, both these experiments were carried out in the vicinity of the
Hopf bifurcation. In contrast, for the present work we studied both SR
and CR in the neighborhood of the homoclinic bifurcation.

## Vi Realization of SOC behavior in glow discharge plasma

## Vii Introduction

Many empirical analyses suggest that power-law behavior in the
distribution of some quantities are quite frequent in nature for
example, @xmath noise, Gutenberg-Richter law for the magnitudes of earth
quakes, stock market, forest fires, ecology, weather etc geophys:pbak ;
prl:carlson ; sciAm:pbak ; Physletta:pbak ; prl:dhar . From the point of
equilibrium statistical mechanics, power law is considered as a
signature of critical fluctuations observed near a second order phase
transition. As we approach the critical temperature, correlation length
diverges and measurable quantities exhibit power law. However, power
laws are often seen in many other systems, not necessarily connected
with equilibrium situations, some of these systems are driven systems
which are very different from equilibrium systems. In the case of second
order transition, the critical state is reached by only through
parameter tuning. The idea of self organized criticality (SOC)
introduced by Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld PRL:PBak was that when the
systems are driven away from equilibrium, they reach a state near to,
but not at, the state that is marginal to major disruptions without any
significant tuning of the system from outside. These systems are
characterized by a spectrum of spatial and temporal scales of the
disruption events that exists in remarkably similar form in a wide
variety of different physical systems.

The simple concept of SOC is the sandpile. Consider, the process of
building a sandpile by dropping sand on a particular spot. As we add
sand, the pile will grow and always chooses its shape which is
independent of the builder. This property is called self organization.
The sandpile surface will steepen until its slope reaches the angle of
repose, the critical angle beyond which further addition of sand will
cause cascades of sand to topple down the sandpile. Most parts of the
sand pile have a slope very close to this critical angle. Any further
addition of the sand grains will trigger cascades of sand particles
which are more commonly known as avalanches. The sand pile is a good
example of a critical state, where the correlation length of
perturbations extends over the entire sandpile, i.e., independent of the
size of the pile, an addition of one grain of sand close to the top of
the pile can influence grains at the bottom. In this process there is no
external parameter needs to be tuned because the critical state in the
sand pile is attained as a consequence of the slow addition of the sand
grains and their spatial redistribution by avalanches PRL:PBak ;
book:bharati .

The SOC concept has been quite rigorously deployed to explain some of
the turbulent transport observations in magnetically confined fusion
devices like Tokamaks. If we consider free energy source in the plasma
is the gradient of the density. When this gradient becomes greater than
some critical value depending upon plasma parameters, by fueling the
plasma and turbulence turbulence develops around the location. This eddy
flatten the density of that position and free energy moves to its
adjacent place and in the similar way eddies may be triggered the new
location. In this way the density profile is modified again and the
process continues and produces avalanche-like phenomenon which has been
successfully explained by SOC concept.

Though SOC concept has been applied quite successfully in high
temperature plasmas like tokamak PRL:BACarreras00 ; POP:BACarreras0 ;
PRL:FSattin , we first observed that the low temperature glow discharge
plasmas also exhibits SOC behavior, for the region less than the Paschen
minimum which has been described in Subsection II.1 of Section II .

From the the Paschen curve [Fig 4 of Section II ] for our system we have
seen that, at low pressure i.e., for less the than Paschen minimum,
discharge struck at higher discharge voltage (DV) [subsection II.1 of
Section II ]. In the lower region, keeping the DV at a constant value of
800 V, a discharge was struck with a very faint glow at @xmath Torr, and
then as the filling pressure was gradually increased by means of the
needle valve, the intensity of the glow suddenly became bright at about
@xmath Torr.

The sudden change in the plasma dynamics at the critical pressure led to
a change in the floating potential, and the discharge current. The
variation of the plasma floating potential, and the plasma discharge
current with pressure have been shown in Figure 27 . It shows that, the
current (solid line) jumped to a larger value by a factor of 15 at
@xmath Torr, and then increased gradually with pressure. On the other
hand, the floating potential rapidly fell to a negative value ( @xmath
V) up to the same critical pressure ( @xmath Torr), and then again
increased (dotted line in Fig. 27 ) with further increase in pressure,
until it finally settled down to @xmath V. So the critical pressure
divides the scanned region into two regions I and II, shown by a
vertical line ( @xmath ) in Figure 27 . The plasma density, temperature,
and electron-electron collision mean free path in region II are @xmath ,
@xmath eV, and @xmath cm respectively. However, in region I, it was
almost impossible to obtain the I-V characteristics because of their
extremely low values. Qualitatively, looking at discharge current, and
glow intensity, region II is probably a normal glow discharge region,
while region I might be the dark or subnormal glow discharge region. In
the region I system exhibits SOC behavior. The boundary between the two
region (critical pressure) where the transition takes place is not a
fixed point, but decreases with the discharge voltage as seen in Figure
28 . It is also seen that the floating potential, and the discharge
current also decrease with discharge voltage.

Figures 29 (a), (b), and (c) are the typical electrostatic fluctuations
at pressures @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath Torr respectively in region I,
while (d), and (e) are the fluctuations at pressures @xmath and @xmath
Torr respectively in region II. In the next section it will be shown
using different analysis techniques that the fluctuation in the region I
is consistence with SOC behavior.

### vii.1 Analysis of SOC behavior

The experimental evidences considered as main ingredients of SOC are
@xmath ( @xmath 0) power law (where @xmath is the frequency of the
fluctuations obtained from fast Fourier transform) PRL:PBak ;
PhLettA:TLRhodes ; PhyslettA:Skokov ; PRL:Kim , long-range correlation
POP:BACarreras2 , and nongaussian probability distribution function
(PDF) conf:Xu . From the power spectral analysis which have been
discussed in Subsection II.3 of Section II , we have estimated the
@xmath from ln(Power) versus ln( @xmath ).

For long-range time correlation we estimated the Hurst exponent H using
rescale range method, and the exponent ( @xmath ) of autocorrelation
function (ACF) decay, as described below. Both the techniques have been
discussed in Subsection II.3 of Section II .

In order to verify nongaussianity we obtained the PDF of the fluctuating
data.

Figure 30 shows ln (Power) vs. ln @xmath of the fluctuations in region
I, from which we estimated the exponent to be @xmath . This agrees well
with the numerical PRL:PBak ; PRA:PBak , as well as experimental
observations PhLettA:TLRhodes ; PhyslettA:Skokov ; POP:BACarreras2 in
the presence of SOC behavior.

Figure 31 shows a typical plot of ln(R/S) vs. ln(time lag) of the
fluctuations in region I, for a pressure of @xmath . The Hurst exponent
H is about @xmath (this indicates long-range time correlations)
PRL:BACarreras00 , and it is almost constant over the entire pressure
range in region I. On the other hand, for sinusoidal like oscillation in
region II, the Hurst exponent is 1 for the lag length of one period of
oscillations, and zero with more than one period lag POP:carreras4 as
shown in Figure 32 . Also in the same region (II) multi slope ln(R/S)
vs. ln(lag) plot as seen in Figure 33 probably due to plasma
instabilities of many frequencies POP:carreras4 . The ACF exponent
@xmath has been calculated for the fluctuations in region I, from the
ln(ACF) vs. ln(time lag) plot as shown in Figure 34 . The ACF (Fig. 34 )
shows power law up to about 6 times the decorrelation time, and after
that it follows exponential decay. Average value of @xmath is about
0.30. Using the relation @xmath PRE:GRangarajan , H calculated from ACF
is @xmath 0.85, which is close to the value of H, calculated using R/S
technique. In region II, no power law decay of ACF has been observed.
The PDF of the floating potential fluctuations in region I, seen in Fig.
35 (a) clearly shows a nongaussian nature. Corresponding best gaussian
fit is given by dotted curve in the same figure.

We suspect that there might be a slightly bimodal distribution similar
to Ref. PhyslettA:Skokov . Figure 35 (b) shows the gaussian nature of
the fluctuations in region II.

Our results of Hurst exponent, @xmath , ACF exponent, @xmath ,
nongaussian PDF, and power spectral index @xmath in the pressure range
@xmath Torr, are consistent with the systems exhibiting SOC like
behavior.

Comparison of @xmath , H by ACF, H by R/S, and @xmath have been shown in
Table 3 , for pressures @xmath , @xmath , @xmath Torr.

### vii.2 Conclusion

We have obtained SOC behavior over a finite range of neutral pressure of
@xmath Torr for a fixed discharge voltage and this region belongs to the
region less than the Paschen minimum Physleta:nurujjaman . Glow
discharges are simple systems, but their physics can be quite
complicated due to the presence of several phenomena like avalanche
breakdown, ionization waves, low frequency ion-acoustic instability,
double layer, chaos, etc. Most of them are highly nonlinear processes
and hence one requires different techniques both statistical and
spectral to investigate and understand their behavior. From our present
analysis we observe that the plasma dynamics in the region I, is
compatible with self organized criticality, while region II, is not.
This could also imply that plasma transport in region I, is quite
different from region II.

## Viii Summary of the work

### viii.1 Summary

The thesis presents the experimental observations of the nonlinear
phenomena @xmath chaos to order transition, self organized criticality
behavior and noise invoked processes like the stochastic and coherence
resonance in an argon dc glow discharge plasma [Fig 1 of Section II ].
Depending upon the gas pressure (p), a discharge was struck at different
discharge voltages (DV), which exhibits a Paschen curve like behavior
[Fig. 4 of Section II ]. The region left to the Paschen minimum is
narrower than the region to the right and the behavior of the plasma
floating potential fluctuations were different on these two sides of the
Paschen curve.

When the system was operated for the pressures greater than the Paschen
minimum, an anode glow or anode spot was observed to form on the anode
and with the increase in the DV its size decreased and finally
diminished at a certain DV. The annular radii of the glow estimated
using CCD camera was in the range of @xmath mm. This observation is very
consistent with the theoretical estimations of thickness ( @xmath )
using the relation @xmath , where k, T, @xmath , and P are the Boltzmann
constant, room temperature in Kelvin scale, ionization cross-section and
pressure in mbar respectively. The estimated thickness of the anode glow
using the above relation for @xmath mbar, @xmath K, is approximately
0.81 mm is within the range of the thickness as obtained from the
experiment ( @xmath mm).

An interesting feature associated with the anode glow was the different
types of oscillations in the floating potential at different pressures,
and these fluctuations have been analyzed for the three typical
pressures in the region greater than the Paschen minimum. At about 0.89
mbar ( @xmath mbar-mm), the discharge was initiated at @xmath V and
simultaneously irregular relaxation type of oscillations were observed
and the regularity of the oscillation also increased with the DVs.
Around 509 V, these oscillations disappeared and this point (DV) is
termed as the bifurcation point ( @xmath ). Almost similar behaviour had
been observed at 0.95 mbar ( @xmath mbar mm) and at 1 mbar ( @xmath mbar
mm ). Initially, the power spectrum of the oscillations as of broad band
nature indicating chaotic behavior of the system. The frequency of the
oscillations were around the ion plasma frequency. An estimate of the
frequency of these instabilities can be obtained from the ion transit
time in the plasma @xmath , where d is the electrode distance. The
estimated ion transit frequency ( @xmath ) for our experimental system
is @xmath kHz which agrees well with the frequency of the relaxation
oscillations of the floating potential.

The presence of relaxation oscillations has been attributed to the
formation of highly nonlinear structures like double layers. We
therefore tried to estimate the correlation dimension ( @xmath ) and the
+ve Lyapunov exponent ( @xmath ) of all the signals. The estimated
@xmath for the data for the three pressures (0.89, 0.95 and 1.0 mbar)
were greater than 3.8 to begin with and decreased with increase in DV.
Since @xmath is a measure of the complexity of the system, initially,
the system was in a complex state as @xmath for all the three pressures
were high and decreased in complexity with increase in DV.

The presence of a +ve Lyapunov exponent ( @xmath ) is the most reliable
signature of the chaotic dynamics. The positive @xmath has been
identified for DV 283, 284, and 290 V at 0.95 mbar and for 293, 296, 300
and 305 V at 1 mbar respectively. At higher pressures we find that in
general @xmath is +ve and @xmath , suggesting a low dimensional chaos.
Wavelet analysis also showed presence of chaos at the initial stage of
the discharge.

Generally, the floating potential fluctuations were complex in nature at
the initial stage of discharge and became regular with increase in DV
and converted to relaxation oscillations and vanished through homoclinic
bifurcation at @xmath . Applying noise beyond the @xmath noise invoked
experiments, coherence and stochastic resonance had been performed. For
the coherence resonance we had only applied noise to the system to get
back the autonomous dynamics, whereas, for the stochastic resonance,
noise and periodic pulse had been applied simultaneously. In order to
overcome the plasma related problem in analyzing the stochastic
resonance, we had devised new analysis techniques absolute mean
difference.

When the system was operated in the pressure region less than the
Paschen minimum, for small range of p ( @xmath Torr or @xmath mbar), it
was observed that the behavior of the floating potential fluctuations
was consistent with SOC. In order to establish the SOC behavior, we had
checked the power law behavior of the power spectrum, the presence of
the long-range correlation by estimating Hurst exponent (H) using R/S
technique and the exponent ( @xmath ) of ACF decay, and the nongaussian
probability distribution function. The results of Hurst exponent (
@xmath ) greater than 0.5, ACF exponent, @xmath , nongaussian PDF, and
power spectral index @xmath in the pressure range @xmath Torr, are
consistent with the systems exhibiting SOC like behavior.

### viii.2 Scope of the future works

Though we have investigated some of the nonlinear processes during the
the course of this thesis work, there are, many problems which we plan
to take up as future plans. They are as follows.

-   Effect of the noise on the autonomous dynamics.

-   Effect of suprathreshold signal and noise to the plasma.

-   Investigation of the existence of canard orbits in plasma.

-   Non-chaotic attractors may be investigated by applying two
    non-commensurate periodic signals.

-   Chaos control and synchronization.

-   Modeling of the experimental results.

Dusty plasma which can be produced very easily in our experimental
system, is another area where, a lot of nonlinear phenomena can be
explored.
