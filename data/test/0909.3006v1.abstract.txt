The high centre-of-mass energy of 200 GeV available at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven opens up the hard scattering regime in heavy-ion collisions. Particles at large transverse momentum originate from the early stage of the interaction and, therefore, probe the medium produced in these collisions. To quantitatively understand the medium induced modification of hadron production, precise measurements of identified hadrons in p+p and d+Au systems are required. This thesis presents the high transverse momentum measurements of neutral pions and eta mesons through their di-photon decay channel, performed with STAR Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter. The medium induced spectrum modification in d+Au collisions is also measured in comparison to the most peripheral d+Au and to the p+p collisions. The results are consistent with the previous STAR charged hadron measurements and with the theory (QCD) calculations, as well as with measurements from PHENIX, another RHIC experiment.
