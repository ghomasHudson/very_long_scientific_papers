Observations of the 21 cm line radiation coming from the epoch of
reionization have a great capacity to study the cosmological growth of
the Universe. Also, CMB polarization produced by gravitational lensing
has a large amount of information about the growth of matter
fluctuations at late time. In this thesis, we investigate their
sensitivities to the impact of neutrino property on the growth of
density fluctuations, such as the total neutrino mass, the neutrino mass
hierarchy, the effective number of neutrino species (extra radiation),
and the lepton asymmetry of our Universe.

We will show that by combining the precise CMB polarization observations
with Square Kilometer Array (SKA) we can measure the impact of non-zero
neutrino mass on the growth of density fluctuation, and determine the
neutrino mass hierarchy at 2 @xmath level if the total neutrino mass is
smaller than 0.1 eV.

Additionally, we will show that by using these combinations we can
constrain the lepton asymmetry better than big-bang nucleosynthesis
(BBN). Besides we discuss constraints on that in the presence of some
extra radiation, and show that the 21 cm line observations can
substantially improve the constraints obtained by CMB alone, and allow
us to distinguish the effects of the lepton asymmetry from those of
extra radiation.
