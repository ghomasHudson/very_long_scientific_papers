## Streszczenie w języku polskim

W niniejszej pracy demonstruję wyniki eksperymentów przeprowadzonych na
kubitach spinowych zrealizowanych w elektrostatycznie zdefiniowanych
kropkach kwantowych z arsenku galu. Szczególny nacisk położony jest na
tłumienie szumu oraz oddziaływanie długozasięgowe.

W pierwszej części pokazujemy że podatność na szum ładunkowy może być
ograniczona przez minimalizację gradientu rozszczepienia qubitu względem
napięć na bramkach. Dla kubitu syngletowo-trypletowego i kubitu
rezonansowej wymiany gradient jest zminimalizowany w symetryczej
konfiguracji szeregu kropek kwantowych. Dzięki symetryzacji uzyskujemy
sześciokrotną poprawę dobroci oscylacji wymiany pomiędzy dwoma
elektronami, natomiast kubit rezonansowej wymiany wykazuje jedynie
nieznaczną poprawę czasu koherencji.

Druga część pracy dotyczy szumu Overhausera wynikającego z oddziaływania
nadsubtelnego pomiędzy elektronem i kompielą spinową. Spektrum szumu
Overhausera jest zgodne z klasycznym modelem dyfuzji w zakresie od mili-
do kilohertza. Tymczasem szum w wysokoczęstotliwościowy jest
skoncentrowany w trzech wąskich pasmach odpowiadających względnej
precesji Larmora jąder trzech izotopów występujących w arsenku galu.
Wykorzystując specjalnie zaprojektowaną dynamicznie odsprzęgającą
sekwencę, działającą jako filtr środkowozaporowy, jesteśmy w stanie
pokazać że czas koherencji spinu elektronu w arsenku galu przekracza 870
@xmath s.

Następnie badamy perspektywę wykorzystania wieloelektronowej kropki
kwantowej jako pośrednika oddziaływania wymiany. Dla dziewięciu
kolejnych obsadzeń jesteśmy w stanie określić spin stanu podstawowego
przez sprzęganie jej z pojedyńczym sąsiadującym elektronem. Dla obsadzeń
nieparzystych obserwujemy zmianę znaku oddziaływania wymiany przy
strojeniu napięcia na bramkach w zakresie kilku miliwoltów w pobliżu
przejścia ładunkowego.

W ostatnim eksperymencie demonstrujemy długozasiegowe oddziaływanie
wymiany któremu pośredniczy wieloelektronowa kropka kwantowa z
bezspinowym stanem podstawowym. Siła oddziaływania wymiany może być
kontrolowana w zakresie sięgającym kilku gigaherców. Niewielkie
rozszczepienie poziomów energetycznych i efekty wielociałowe prowadzą do
pojawienia się punktów w przestrzeni napięć na bramkach
charakteryzujących się niską wrażliwością na szum ładunkowy, które mogą
być wykorzystane do realizacji długozasięgowych bramek dwukubitowych o
wysokiej dobroci.

### Résumé i dansk

Denne afhandling præsenterer resultater fra et ekperimentelt studie af
spin kvantebit fremstillet i gatedefinerede galliumarsenid kvantepunkter
med fokus på støjdæmpning og langdistancekopling.

For det første viser vi, at følsomheden til ladningsstøj kan reduceres
ved at reducere gradienten af kvantebit energien med hensyn til
gatespændinger. Vi viser, at dette for singlet-triplet- og resonant
udvekslingskvantebit kan opnås ved at drive en kvantepunktsrække i en
yderst symmetrisk konfiguration. Symmetriseringstilgangen resulterer i
en faktor seks forbedring af kvalitetsfaktoren af
singlet-tripletkvantebittens elektronudvekslingsoscillationer, mens
coherenstiden for resonant udevekslingskvantebitten er marginalt
længere.

For det andet præsenterer vi en undersøgelse af Overhauser-feltstøj, der
opstår som følge af interaktion med atomspinbadet. Vi viser, at
Overhauser-feltstøj følger en klassisk spindiffusionsmodel i området fra
1 mHz til 1 kHz, mens megahertz-skalaens støjspektrum er fokuseret i tre
smalle bånd relateret til relativ Larmor præcession af de tre nukleare
arter. Anvendelse af en dynamisk afkoblingssekvens, som er designet til
at notch-filtrere smalbåndsstøjen, gør det muligt at sætte den højeste,
up-to-date, nedre grænse på elektronens spinconherenstid i
galliumarsenid: 870 @xmath s.

Senere studerer vi perspektiverne i at udnytte et
multielektronkvantepunkt som mediator for udvekslingsinteraktionen. Vi
undersøger samspillet mellem et enkelt spin og et
multielektronkvantepunkt i ni forskellige ladningsbesættelser og
identificerer spingrundtilstanden i alle tilfælde. For et lige besat,
spin-1/2 multielektronkvantepunkt medfører variationer af gatespændingen
med et par milivolt i nærheden af ladningstransitionen et fortegnsskift
af udvekslingsinteraktionen med en enkelt naboelektron.

Endelig demonstrerer vi udvekslingskoblingen mellem fjerne elektroner
formidlet af et lige besat, spin-0 multielektronkvantepunkt.
Udvekslingsinteraktionsstyrken kan styres op til nogle-gigahertz
frekvenser. Lille energiniveauafstand og mangelegemeeffekter giver
anledning til positioner i gatespændingsrummet, der er karakteriseret af
nedsat følsomhed til ladningsstøj, som kan bruges til at implementere
nøgagtige, langdistanse to-kvantebitoperationer.

## Part I Introduction

### Chapter 1 Overview

#### 1.1 Organization of the thesis

Part I is the overview of the field of spin qubits in gate-defined
quantum dots. In the next section of this chapter I draw a broad picture
of the field to present the state of the art and the main challenges the
community is facing. Chapter 2 includes a proper introduction to the
field of spin qubits realized in gate-defined quantum dots. It provides
a description of the techniques that can be employed to manipulate the
electronic spins and the list of qubit implementations in quantum dot
arrays.

The main results of this thesis will be contained in three parts,
corresponding to three topics which I studied. Each part consists of the
reproductions of published results and is extended with the description
of the essential concepts, or puts the published results in a broader
context. In several places I supplement the published results with
several additional datasets and elements of the analysis that did not
find their place in articles.

Part II is dedicated to the mitigation of the charge noise which affects
the fidelity of the exchange gates. Chapter 3 describes the principle of
symetrization of spin qubits. Chapter 4 presents how to apply this idea
to the two-electron exchange gate in a double quantum dot. Chapter 5
describes the symmetrization applied to the three-electron resonant
exchange qubit.

Part III focuses on the other source of the spin qubits dephasing, i.e.
the interaction with the spinful nuclei of the crystal lattice that
hosts the quantum dot. Chapter 7 reviews the most important properties
of the nuclear spin bath and briefly introduces the dynamical decoupling
techniques. Chapter 8 presents nuclear noise spectrum study over a
frequency range of 9 orders of magnitude. Chapter 9 explains how the
dynamical decoupling sequence can be viewed as a filter in a frequency
domain It also demonstrates that the sequence can be adjusted to
suppress the component of the nuclear noise related to the Larmor
precession of the different nuclear species.

Part IV is dedicated to multielectron quantum dots. Chapter 12 contains
an article that provides the effective model of the multielectron dot.
It also presents the study of 9 subsequent multielectron dot
occupancies, by coupling it to the two-electron double quantum dot.
Chapter 13 focuses on one particular occupancy of the multielectron
quantum dot where the negative exchange interaction was observed. The
following chapter 14 describes the experiment in which two distant
electronic spins are exchange-coupled via a multielectron quantum dot,
which serves as an interaction mediator. The final chapter 16 contrasts
the long-range exchange coupling with other proposals for long range
coupling and suggests several relatively simple, high-impact follow-up
experiments.

The last part V consists of appendices. In chapter A I include the
schematics of the experimental setup. Chapter B contains the recipe for
fabrication of GaAs quantum dot devices with a single layer of confining
gates. Chapter C introduces the technique that has been a key to fast
tuning of the dot arrays: real time measurements of the charge diagrams.
The final chapter D is a hybrid between a manual and documentation of
the Igor Pro procedures that were used to design, upload and apply the
sequences of voltage pulses using the Tektronix 5014c arbitrary waveform
generator.

#### 1.2 Gate-defined quantum dots as qubits (DiVincenzo’s criteria)

Quantum computation is one of the holy grails of modern physics. As
such, it is a topic of numerous books and articles with which this brief
introduction has no chance to compete. For this reason I restrain myself
from describing the ultimate goal to which this work contributes.
Instead, I will give a brief introduction to the techniques used for
spin manipulation and readout and describe the state of the art. To
maintain the logical structure I will organize these considerations
according to the DiVincenzo’s criteria for quantum computing [ 1 ] (in a
slightly rearranged order). In this manner I attempt to put the results
presented in this thesis in their broader context.

##### 1.2.1 A (scalable) physical system with well characterized qubits

A single spin 1/2 is conceivably the most natural realization of the
qubit, since it forms a natural 2-level quantum-mechanical system. This
is the reason why the first implementation of the quantum algorithms
were performed on systems of spin-1/2 nuclei [ 2 , 3 ] . However it was
realized that small strength of two qubit coupling and lack of
tunability prevents this kind of quantum processor to be scalable [ 4 ]
. An alternative solution [ 5 ] proposed by Daniel Loss and David
DiVincenzo was to employ single electronic spins in gate tunable quantum
dots. Compared to NMR implementation this proposal has numerous
advantages: the electron magnetic moment is larger than the nuclear
magnetic moment by a factor of @xmath 1000 enabling faster manipulation.
Moreover, the artificial molecule consisting of multiple quantum dots
can be arbitrarily designed, the strength of couplings – voltage
controlled and the qubits themselves could be moved within the quantum
processor.

##### 1.2.2 The ability to initialize the state of the qubits to a
simple fiducial state, such as @xmath

Using a higher magnetic moment (or g-factor) becomes a clear advantage
of electron spin qubits when considering the state initialization. A
g-factor of the order of 1 leads to a Zeeman splitting @xmath of tens of
microelectronvolts at 1 T. For comparison the thermal fluctuations at
100 mK have a characteristic energy of @xmath @xmath eV. The ratio of
these two quantities leads to the conclusion that for moderate magnetic
fields and at dilution-refrigerator temperature the electronic spin can
be prepared in the ground state, simply by letting it relax [ 6 ] .

Freedom in control of the quantum dot occupation provides also a mean
for the initialization of a more complex multielectron state, by
exploiting the Pauli exclusion principle [ 7 , 8 ] . The exclusion
principle forces two electrons with parallel spins (i.e. in one of the
triplet states), located in the same quantum dot to occupy different
orbitals. On the contrary for the antiparallel configuration of spins
(i.e. singlet state) the electrons can occupy the same, lowest orbital.
The arising energy splitting between the two-electron states enables the
initialization of the electron pair in a singlet configuration simply by
letting the system relax to its ground state. Once the relaxation
happens one electron can be moved to a different quantum dot resulting
in a one-step initialization of the entangled state. In fact this very
method is exploited in all the original experiments presented in this
thesis. The idea could in principle be employed to initialize more
complex highly entangled multielectron states, by preparing a
multielectron quantum dot in the ground state, followed by shuttling of
the electrons to the designated single-electron quantum dots.

##### 1.2.3 A qubit-specific measurement capability

For gate-defined quantum dots the ability to initialize the electronic
spins turns out to be closely related to our ability to read them out.
In most works up to date the readout has been performed in two steps.
The first step is to convert the spin state to charge state, i.e. induce
a difference of charge distribution between different spin states in an
incoherent manner. In turn, the difference in charge distribution
affects the conductance of neighboring transistor (in practice a quantum
point contact or a single electron transistor). In the second step the
conductance is readout by means of lock-in or reflectometry measurement.

The two techniques for spin-to-charge conversion are dual to the two
initialization techniques, and both were shown to provide a single-shot
readout fidelity of individual spins [ 6 , 9 ] . In the first technique
the spin-up and spin-down states are tuned in such a way that one is
located above the Fermi level of neighboring lead, while other one
remains below [ 6 ] . Whenever the electron has high energy it will
eventually tunnel out of the lead, resulting in a change of the charge
distribution, and then the electron will tunnel back in onto a dot. The
observation of this process relies, similarly to initialization, on
adjusting the Zeeman splitting to be larger the temperature of the
electrons in the lead. The advantage of this technique is that towards
the end of the readout phase the electronic spin is guaranteed to be
initialized in the ground state. On the other hand, the limitation is
that the readout speed is set by the tunneling rates which have to be
small for high fidelity qubit manipulations.

The counterpart of singlet initialization provides a mean for
measurement of the relative orientation of the two spins. This method
exploits the fact that, as explained before, the triplet states with two
electrons occupying the same dot have significantly larger energy than a
singlet state. This implies that for a carefully tuned double quantum
dot the spin triplet state of the lowest energy will consist of the two
electrons residing on different dots. Meanwhile for the singlet state
with the lowest energy two electrons will reside on a single dot. Once
more, the resulting difference in the charge distribution can be picked
up by the neighboring charge sensor. This technique, used in all
experiments described in this thesis, has three significant advantages
over the alternative described above: in principle it is non-destructive
(excluding decoherence between triplet states and avoidable relaxation)
and does not require a neighboring lead.

##### 1.2.4 Long relevant decoherence times, much longer than the gate
operation time

Another DiVincenzo criterium refers to the preservation of the
multiqubit quantum state. In this context the exploitation of the spin
degree of freedom yields significant advantages. In the simplest view
the advantage is related to the relative weakness of magnetic
interactions compared to electrostatic interactions. This implies that
the external disturbances that can lead to decoherence are either weak ¹
¹ 1 typical hyperfine interaction with between an electron and a single
nuclei of the host lattice is of the order @xmath eV, for the electronic
wavefunction which typically spreads over a million of crystal unit
cells [ 10 ] or indirect ² ² 2 related to mixing of a spin with other
degrees of freedom due to spin-orbit [ 11 ] or exchange interaction [ 12
] . Nonetheless these decoherence mechanisms remain a significant
challenge. This thesis yields two results related to the decoherence
problem.

Part III is dedicated to the study of the interaction between the
electronic spin and the collection of millions of nuclear spin in the
gallium arsenide crystal. In these studies we address the decoherence
due to the collective influence of multiple nuclear spins. In particular
the use of elaborated decoupling sequences enables us to increase the
spin coherence time by over five orders of magnitude. This method can be
expected to find application in areas closely related to quantum
computing, but is not an ultimate solution to the issue of the electron
spin decoherence due to interaction with the nuclear bath. In a long
run, more promising path is either to change the semiconducting material
hosting the quantum dots to one where nuclei with a non-zero spin are
sparse (e.g. silicon-based quantum dots) [ 13 , 14 , 15 ] , or to use
hole spins [ 16 , 17 ] which enjoy much weaker hyperfine interaction.

Reduction of the indirect influence of the charge noise is the topic of
Part II of this thesis. I describe there how introduction of the
additional symmetries reduces admixture of the charge degree of freedom
to the multielectron spin state. On the fundamental level our study
shows that the spin qubits are at their best when the difference between
the spin states does not entail the difference in the charge
distribution.

##### 1.2.5 A “universal” set of quantum gates

The number of methods for manipulation electronic spins in gate-defined
quantum dots is numerous. The difficulty lies in the choice of the qubit
definition and manipulation method that provides a set of universal
gates that do not entail to an increased susceptibility to noise. The
almost complete list of available variants will be included in the
introduction to spin qubits in chapter 2 , and therefore I will here
limit the discussion to presenting the state of the art in the
manipulation of electronic spins.

In terms of single qubit gates the most promising candidates are simple
single-electron qubits defined in Si/SiGe quantum wells equipped with a
micromagnet. The two recent experiments [ 18 , 19 ] showed that electron
rotation induced by shaking a single electron in the gradient of an
external magnetic field can reach the limit of 99% fidelity which is
also a threshold for the application of quantum error correction. These
results are very promising, especially because they did not take
advantage of the isotopically enriched silicon which would result in
further improvements in coherence by removing the residual atoms of
spinful isotope @xmath Si.

A similar result was obtained for a single electronic spin in MOS
structure that uses isotopically purified silicon [ 20 ] . Moreover,
this result was followed by the presentation of the two qubit gate [ 21
] , although it fidelity was not quantified. A significant limitation in
this experiment was the insufficient tunability of the tunnel coupling,
due to which the exchange interaction between electrons was turned on
and off adiabatically, rather than rapidly with respect to difference of
Zeeman splittings of the two electrons. Nevertheless, the realization of
single- and two-qubit gates in these two kinds of silicon structures is
a signature that exploiting a spin-free nuclear lattices is, in my
opinion, the most promising path towards spin-qubit based quantum
computation.

Even higher degree of control over two-qubit system was obtained with
singlet-triplet qubits in GaAs nanostructures. Reference [ 22 ] presents
a two-qubit gate with 90% fidelity and single-qubit gates of 99%
fidelity. That achievement was reached by harnessing the nuclear spin
bath by means of dynamical nuclear polarization and reduction of the
charge noise by operating the qubits in a rotating frame. As of today
realization of such a complex operation is not possible in silicon-based
qubits, since it is much more difficult to fabricate Si/SiGe or MOS
quantum dots.

The amount of overhead related to dynamical nuclear polarization makes
the electron spin qubits systems in GaAs unsuitable for scalability.
However due to easier fabrication and greater tunability this system
serves as a playground for increasing the size of electron array. In
that field arrays of five, tunnel-coupled quantum dots equipped with two
independent charge sensors (chapter 14 ) are, to my knowledge, the
largest system of coherently controlled electronic spins. The result
presented there also addresses another problem that needs to be solved
in order to begin scaling quantum dot based systems: the gate crowding

##### 1.2.6 A scalable physical system (with well characterized qubits)

The gate crowding is a consequence of the small dimensions of the
quantum dots. Even though small size may ultimately be an advantage,
once the quantum dot array reaches a phase of industrialization, at the
stage of developing few-qubit devices it is a significant obstacle. This
is because the typical gate size required to tune a potential
sufficiently precisely must have a width of tens of nanometers. These
dimensions are at the limit of state of the art electron beam
lithography techniques, and almost certainly exclude possibility of
building large, two-dimensional arrays of directly tunnel-coupled
quantum dots within the next few years. This concern leads to an
extensive search for a potential long-range coupling mechanism.

In chapter 14 , I present a proof-of-principle experiment for performing
a long-range (micrometer scale) exchange gate between electronic spins.
This approach involves a multielectron quantum dot as the interaction
mediator and avoids exploiting degrees of freedom different than spin.

Another extensively studied long range coupling mechanism is a
dipole-dipole coupling between hybridized spin-charge qubits mediated by
a superconducting cavity [ 23 , 24 ] . This concept is based on the
enormous success of the superconducting qubits and may provide a method
of qubit coupling over enormous distances (of several milimeters). The
difficulty this approach poses is hybridization with the charge degree
of freedom which increases the susceptibility to charge noise. Therefore
an improved understanding of its origin may be a key for scaling quantum
dot systems.

### Chapter 2 Spin qubits

Along the lines of the overview chapter 1 I will devote this chapter to
spin qubits and minimize the introduction to quantum mechanics and
quantum computing. Section 2.1 provides an elementary background to the
description of the two level system with the main purpose of introducing
the Bloch sphere representation. Section 2.2 describes how single
electrons can be confined and isolated in a solid state system, in
particular in GaAs gate-defined quantum dots. Section 2.3 introduces the
implementations of the qubit in a single-electron quantum dots that were
demonstrated experimentally.

#### 2.1 Qubit

##### 2.1.1 Definition

A qubit is the basic unit of quantum information, in analogy to a
(classical) bit being the unit of (classical) information. Both qubits
and bits can be in one of two states, usually labeled ‘‘0’’ and ‘‘1’’.
Of these two a qubit is however infinitely more complex ¹ ¹ 1 In a sense
that an infinite (countable) number of bits is necessary to fully
describe state of a single qubit. since by definition it may be in a
superposition of the two states.

Formally the qubit state @xmath can be represented as a linear
combination of the two orthogonal vectors, @xmath and @xmath
(representing 0 and 1 states)

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where complex coefficients @xmath and @xmath are the probability
amplitudes and are related to probabilities @xmath of finding the qubit
in state @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

The probabilistic interpretation of @xmath and @xmath implies
normalization of the vector @xmath representing the state of the qubit

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

Moreover it turns out that the relative phase between the two
coefficients has no physically observable consequences.

##### 2.1.2 Most handy representation

Normalization condition and irrelevance of the global phase allows to
represent the qubit state in a most helpful manner, i.e. as a point of a
sphere (called Bloch sphere). For that purpose the coefficients @xmath
and @xmath must be rewritten, so that the qubit state is represented by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath . In this form of @xmath and @xmath can be
interpreted as coordinates of a point on the Bloch sphere (Fig. 2.1 ).

The operations on the qubit state also have a natural representation on
the Bloch sphere, as rotations around some axis. Some of the most common
single qubit gates are even named after their graphical representation,
e.g. @xmath -rotation around @xmath axis.

##### 2.1.3 Imperfect qubit states and operations

In experiments one never finds the qubit to be perfectly prepared or
manipulated. Even though the above notation very often suffices to
explain the experimental results, one often needs to quantify the errors
of manipulations. One can derive mathematical formalism to describe such
situation by considering that the qubit might be in one of several pure
states @xmath with classical probability @xmath . Such representation
turns out to be an excessive one, since many of such states are
physically indistinguishable. The density matrix representation turns
out to be the simplest sufficient description of imperfect states.

For the physical state in one of several pure states @xmath with
classical probability @xmath one defines the density matrix by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

Such positive definite matrix has trace 1. In case of a single qubit
@xmath is a @xmath matrix, which can be fully characterized by only
three parameters @xmath , @xmath an @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the identity and @xmath are the Pauli matrices.
Parameters @xmath , @xmath an @xmath , represented as a single vector
@xmath must fulfill @xmath for the matrix to represent a physical state.

Drawing @xmath on the Bloch sphere (with its center at the origin of the
coordinate system and radius 1) is an accurate representation of the
imperfect, mixed state. This means that the rotations representing the
operations on the pure qubit state will act in an identical way on
@xmath . Finally, imperfect qubit manipulations can be represented as
combinations of the sphere rotation, shrinking or squeezing along some
directions.

##### 2.1.4 Multi-qubit (and multi-spin) states

Mathematically the multi-qubit states are represented by the vectors in
the tensor-product space of several two-level systems. Such a general
state can be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath indicates a list of 0’s and 1’s. The number of @xmath real
parameters necessary to fully characterize such state is a manifestation
of increased computing power of a quantum system over a classical one.

##### 2.1.5 Universal set of gates

Even though the number of states available in multi-qubit system is huge
the set of operations necessary to perform an arbitrary computation is
rather limited [ 25 ] .

First part of the universal set of gates are the arbitrary single qubit
rotations. The standard way to achieve these is to combine the rotations
around two orthogonal qubit axes (usually @xmath and @xmath ). Then an
arbitrary rotation can by realized by rotation by three Euler angles.

One of the spin-qubit realizations, exchange-only qubit (Subcection
2.3.3 ), gives a possibility of performing rotations about two axes
which are tilted by 120 @xmath with respect to each other. Although
these rotations are sufficient to construct an arbitrary single-qubit
gate. Such twist to Euler angles increases difficulty of designing and
optimization of a quantum algorithm. On the other hand, it is beneficial
to supplement the @xmath and @xmath rotations with the @xmath rotations
to reduce depth of the final quantum circuit.

In principle the set of single qubit operations can be minimized to only
two @xmath rotations and @xmath -gate (which is a rotation by @xmath
angle). This can be proven by showing that the set of states achievable
by combining these three rotations is dense on a Bloch sphere, and
therefore arbitrary rotations can be realized with arbitrary precision.
However one must remember that the number of primary gates that must be
composed to perform such arbitrary rotation can introduce a huge
overhead in execution of a quantum algorithm. Therefore one must
remember that in the set of available single qubit rotations affects the
length and of the algorithm and ultimately has an impact on resources
required to implement quantum error correction.

The second part of the required gate set is an two-qubit entangling
gate. Usually three kinds of such gates are considered.

A CNOT gate is a quantummechanical equivalent of the classical gate with
the same name It changes the state on

CPHASE gate is the most commonly realized two qubit gate. The name
indicates that changing the phase between @xmath and @xmath state of the
target qubit conditioned by the control qubit. This operation is
equivalent to adding a phase factor to @xmath state with respect to
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath .

The final possibility, most natural for exchange-coupled spins, is a
@xmath gate. This gate results from interrupting the flip-flop process
halfway through. For example, it can take the two spin state between
different states in a cycle

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

#### 2.2 Confining electronic spins

##### 2.2.1 Semiconductor platforms for confining electronic spins

A single electronic spin 1/2 is such a natural realization of the qubit
that virtually any structure capable of confining an electron was at
some point in the history considered to be a possible platform for
quantum computing. In particular, semiconductor nanostructures allow to
benefit from the wide range of the available fabrication techniques.
Roughly speaking, there are two types of such structures in which
coherent spin manipulations were realized: electrons bound on the
crystal impurities or confined by combination of band-gap engineering
and gating (i.e. quantum dots). On the other hand, these systems can be
divided into two groups according to the method of manipulation and
detection: all-electrical and mixed optical and electrical. The summary
of semiconductor systems in which coherent spin manipulations of single
electrons was performed up to date is presented in Table 2.1 .

In a nutshell, the electrons in optically active structures are expected
to serve as an interface between a solid state quantum processor and
photonic quantum communication network. In particular the depth of the
binding on such impurities as NV centers in diamond [ 26 , 27 , 28 ] and
vacancy in silicon carbide [ 29 ] enables their coherent control at room
temperature. On the other hand, self-assembled quantum dots [ 30 , 31 ]
can be embedded into carefully designed optical cavities enabling very
efficient extraction of emitted photons [ 32 ] .

The electronically manipulated spins are rather viewed as the platform
for quantum processor, as suggested in the seminal articles by Loss &
DiVincenzo [ 5 ] and Kane [ 33 ] . The leading impurity-based
implementation of electrically controlled qubit is based on individual
phosphorus donors in silicon [ 33 , 13 , 34 ] . Meanwhile there are
multiple competitive quantum dot realizations. Among these, the qubits
based on nanowires [ 35 ] or carbon nanotubes [ 36 ] are less promising,
due to scaling difficulties related to arranging multiple nanowires or
nanotubes in a deterministic manner. The most complex qubits are
currently realized in GaAs heterostructures [ 7 , 37 ] , however the
scaling perspectives are limited by the decoherence related to
interaction of the electron with the nuclear spin bath. Finally, in
silicon quantum wells [ 14 , 38 ] and MOS structures [ 21 ] this problem
is eliminated. However so far the reliability of device fabrication in
this systems is limited. A huge hope is that small adjustments to CMOS
technology will be sufficient to create spin qubit devices with
industrial processes [ 15 ] .

In what follows I will focus on the description of techniques used to
control GaAs spin qubits, however most of them can be readily applied to
Si/SiGe and MOS qubits with the added value of improved coherence.

##### 2.2.2 Electron confinement GaAs nanostructures

Confinement of the electrons in the GaAs quantum dot is achieved by the
combination of the band gap engineering and electrostatic gating. The
2-dimensional electron gas in this structure is formed at the interface
between GaAs and AlGaAs crystals, on the GaAs side. It appears there as
a result of attraction to the ionized silicon dopants located in the
uniform layer above [ 39 ] (Fig. 2.2 ). The three key characteristics of
the heterostructure essential for spin qubits applications are the
following.

First, the 2DEG density should be such that the typical area per
electron matches closely the expected size of the quantum dot. For a
circular single electron quantum dot of 25 nm radius we obtain that 2DEG
density should be approximately @xmath m @xmath . Second, the distance
to the surface should be as small as possible so the shape of potential
created by the metallic gates deposited on top of the heterostructure
was not excessively smoothened. In particular, the created potential
variations should be much stronger than the intrinsic ones due to
built-in inhomogeneity of the doping layer. Otherwise the positions of
the dots will be accidental, rather that intentional. For the dot
diameter of 50 nm the depth of the 2DEG smaller that @xmath 100 nm is
desirable. Third, the 2DEG should have high mobility. In principle this
condition is not necessary for quantum dot creation. However high
mobility increases the dots tunability, is likely related to the sample
stability. Moreover, the mobility may affect the performance of the
parts of the device other than spin qubit itself (e.g. leads, especially
the ones attached to radio-frequency sensor dots).

Further confinement of the electrons is performed by means of an
adjustable electrostatic potential controlled by metallic gates located
on top of the device. Due to small dimensions the gates are defined by
electron beam lithography ² ² 2 Except for CMOS structures. The idea
behind studying them is to use conventional industrial optical
lithography techniques. . Typically the gates are made of gold with thin
sticking layer (e.g. titanium), however in the structures that require
multilayer gating, aluminum is a common choice [ 40 ] since native oxide
that forms in contact with the air can serve as a naturally insulating
layer.

The gates are arranged so as to surround a small area of the 100-250 nm
diameter ³ ³ 3 For n-type GaAs devices operated in single electron
regime. Dimensions in different materials are chosen differently due to
different effective mass of the carriers, to maintain tunability of the
tunnel couplings and control the energy of the lowest excited orbitals.
The actual dot size is smaller than gate to gate distance, since 2DEG is
depleted within a certain radius around the gate. as shown in figure 2.3
. The optional gate in the center, operated at positive voltage helps to
create a deep potential well, but requires deposition of the insulating
layer between the semiconductor and the gates to prevent leakage through
the Schottky diode. The insulating layer has the positive side effect of
blocking the tunneling events that give rise to the sample instabilities
[ 41 ] .

#### 2.3 Qubit implementations

Note: the description of various qubit implementations is written under
the assumption that they are realized in GaAs or other material with
negative g-factor. This implies that states with spin up @xmath have
lower energy than states with spin down @xmath . The description of the
implementations applies also to realization of the qubits in materials
with positive g-factor, in which case one must replace every @xmath
symbol with @xmath and vice versa.

##### 2.3.1 Single spin (Loss-DiVincenzo qubit)

It is most natural to use the spin projections @xmath and @xmath as the
two qubit states. However to name a system a qubit one needs to indicate
methods of initialization, coherent manipulation and readout. For that
reason it is necessary to apply an external magnetic field that
Zeeman-splits the two states.

If the Zeeman splitting is larger than the typical energy of thermal
fluctuations @xmath , the Loss-DiVincenzo qubit initialization can be
realized by letting the system reach the thermal equilibrium. At this
point one has to remember that relaxation at any other stage of
computation is an undesired effect. Therefore one must design a scheme
in which relaxation rate can be manipulated. It is usually achieved by
adjusting the chemical potential of @xmath and @xmath relative to the
Fermi level of the neighboring lead (Fig. 2.4 ).

In the manipulation stage the quantum dot is Coulomb blocked. In the
initialization stage the chemical potential of @xmath is moved above the
Fermi energy of the leads [ 6 ] . In the latter case the electron in
@xmath state can tunnel out, and later an electron in @xmath state can
take its place. If the tunneling rates are sufficiently high the
relaxation rates are significantly increased. Moreover, the tunneling
events (or their absence) can be detected by the neighboring charge
sensor which yields a readout mechanism.

Manipulation of the Loss-DiVincenzo qubit can be done either with
oscillating magnetic fields [ 8 ] (electron spin resonance, ESR) or with
electric fields (electron dipole spin resonance, EDSR). To achieve the
latter, there must be a mechanism which couples charge and spin degrees
of freedom, i.e. spin-orbit interaction [ 42 ] or a magnetic field
gradient [ 43 ] . The advantage of EDSR is that is easier to address
specific, individual spins, by applying the radio-frequency excitation
only to the gate located closely to one of the quantum dots. AC magnetic
field is much more difficult to localize – the excitation is created
with an oscillating current through the macroscopic stripline.
Addressability is achieved by detuning the resonant frequencies of
different qubits - either with variations in local magnetic field
created by micromagnets [ 19 ] or by locally adjusting the electronic
g-factor [ 20 ] .

The two qubit gate between Loss-DiVincenzo qubit can be most easily
realized with exchange interaction. Conventionally the exchange
interaction is induced by tilting a potential of the double quantum dot
[ 7 ] . This procedure admixes (2,0) to (1,1) charge occupations (where
the two numbers indicate the number of electrons on the two dots). Due
to Pauli exclusion principle the admixing process differs between
singlet @xmath and any of the triplet states @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
. In singlet configuration the two electrons are allowed to occupy the
same orbital, while in triplet configuration added electron must occupy
first excited state. This results in Heisenberg type interaction whose
Hamiltonian has the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath indicates the exchange strength and @xmath are the spin
operators corresponding to the two electrons. Depending on whether the
exchange interaction is turned on and off diabatically or adiabatically
with respect to magnetic field gradients the interaction if this
character can be used to perform a SWAP-like [ 7 ] of CPHASE-like gate [
21 ] .

Multiple alternative methods of inducing exchange interaction were
considered up to date, with the goal if decreasing susceptibility of the
system to charge noise during exchange gate and increasing the range of
the interaction. These are discussed in detail in Parts II and IV of
this thesis.

##### 2.3.2 Singlet-triplet qubit (S-T@xmath)

The singlet-triplet S-T @xmath qubit is defined in a @xmath subspace of
the two-electron double quantum dot, where @xmath is the total spin
projection on the direction of the magnetic field. The two level system
is therefore spanned by @xmath and @xmath states or, equivalently, by
@xmath and @xmath states (Fig. 2.5 a). In absence of the exchange energy
the ifference in the Zeeman splitting between the two electrons sets
@xmath and @xmath to be the eigenstates and provides a first rotation
axis (red colored arrow labeled @xmath ). When the exchange interaction
dominates over the difference between the Zeemans splitting the @xmath
and @xmath are the system eigenstates, which defines the second rotation
axis (green colored arrow labeled @xmath ). Experimentally, the
difference of the Zeeman splittings is usually fixed, set by the
gradient of the external [ 44 ] or effective [ 45 ] magnetic field, or
the difference between g-factors in the two dots. Meanwhile the exchange
strength can be controlled in a range of several orders of magnitude by
switching between (2,0) and (1,1) charge configurations. For the
experimentalist this is equivalent to moving along the detuning @xmath
axis showed in the charge diagram in Fig. 2.5 b.

Figure 2.5 c shows a simplified schematic of the spin states along the
detuning @xmath axis, in the vicinity of the charge transition. In the
left side of the diagram, in (2,0) charge state, the exchange
interaction dominates over the Zeeman splitting difference and the
eigenstates of the system are common eigenstates of the total spin
operator @xmath and the operator of the total spin projection on the
direction of the magnetic field @xmath . In the right side, in (1,1)
charge state, the electrons are decoupled from each other so the
eigenstates are the tensor products of individual spin states @xmath and
@xmath . In the middle region the eigenstates continuously change, which
is used to incoherently convert @xmath and @xmath states into @xmath and
@xmath , or vice versa.

Using the two spins to define a single qubit has the disadvantage of
leaving several states unused, in this case the fully polarized triplet
states @xmath and @xmath . This introduces the threat of leakage error.
Due to typical long relaxation times and large energy separation the
leakage risk when performing single qubit gates appears only at the
crossing between @xmath and @xmath states. This is usually avoided by
performing subnanosecond, diabatic “jumps” between points on the @xmath
axis at a significant separation from the crossing.

The leakage errors become a significant problem when considering
implementation of the two-qubit gate with the exchange interaction. This
is because such interaction enables transfer of the energy between the
two qubits and lifts the protection provided by energy conservation. In
fact, the exchange interaction between the two electrons assigned to
different qubits is a perfect leakage mechanism since it connects @xmath
and @xmath states. This leakage can be suppressed by performing
CPHASE-like gate in which the exchange between the electrons belonging
to different qubits is turned on and off adiabatically with respect to
Zeeman splitting of the correspoinding spins, in analogy to Ref. [ 21 ]
. In principle ⁴ ⁴ 4 which is extremely hard to realize experimentally
it can be also suppressed by keeping the exchange interaction within the
qubits finite.

Exploiting the dipole moment between @xmath and @xmath at the
(2,0)-(1,1) charge transition provides alternative methods of performing
two qubit gates. One has to take these ideas with a grain of salt, since
use of the dipole moment entails increased susceptibility to the charge
noise. The simplest way is to use direct dipole-dipole interaction
between neighboring double dots [ 37 ] . Although this scheme allows to
achieve 90% gate fidelities [ 22 ] , such gates may turn out to be too
slow to be practical in the long perspective.

Dipole moment also provides a mean for coupling the S-T @xmath qubit to
the microwave superconducting resonator [ 23 , 24 , 46 ] , which can
mediate interaction between qubits separated by milimiter-scale
distances. In recent experiments the electron-cavity coupling was shown
to be as strong as 240 MHz [ 24 ] which can be translated to a potential
gate time of about 4 ns.

##### 2.3.3 Exchange-only qubit and Resonant exchange qubit

Both, Loss-DiVincenzo and singlet-triplet qubits require several
different manipulation techniques to achieve a full single qubit
control. Using a three-electron systems allows to perform all
manipulations using only exchange interaction [ 47 ] . This can be
easily understood when one realizes that exchange interaction conserves
the total spin. For single- and two- electron system all spin states
differ either by amplitude of the total spin or its projection. Only
addition of the third electron creates a subspace with two states having
both of these quantum numbers identical.

Exchange-only qubit and resonant exchange qubit are both defined in the
three-electron triple quantum dot [ 48 , 49 ] . The two qubit states are
@xmath and @xmath , which both belong to @xmath , @xmath subspace of the
three-electron system. These are the eigenstates when electron in the
middle quantum dot interacts equally strongly with the electrons located
in the left and right dot. By changing ratio between the two exchange
interactions it is possible to change quantization (or rotation) axis by
up to 120 @xmath . This is illustrated in Fig. 2.6 a with the two arrows
showing rotation axes in the extreme case of only left or right exchange
being non-zero.

Readout and initialization of the triple dot qubits can be performed
using spin-blockade, in a similar manner to singlet-triplet qubit. For
extreme negative values of @xmath two qubit eigenstates are @xmath and
@xmath . Here the first symbol indicates spin state of the electrons
located on the middle and the left quantum dot, while the arrow
represents the spin of the electron in the right dot. One can notice
that the middle-left electron pair is either in a pure singlet or pure
triplet configuration, giving rise to Pauli blockade and enabling
spin-to-charge conversion, as well as initialization via relaxation to
the ground state.

Exchange-only qubit is usually operated by adjusting gate voltages along
a single axis [ 50 , 51 ] (called detuning @xmath ), between (2,0,1),
(1,1,1) and (1,0,2) electron occupancies (Fig. 2.6 b). To better
understand the methods of operation it is helpful to analyze the energy
diagram of spin states along @xmath (Fig. 2.6 c). As visualized with the
two colored lines, one can control the rotation axis by changing @xmath
.

Resonant exchange is a variation of the exchange-only qubit. The qubit
subspace is the same, however resonant exchange is operated in the
regime where both @xmath and @xmath are large (on the order of hundreds
of megahertz), while operations are performed by means of RF excitation
applied to one of the gates [ 52 ] (Fig. 2.7 ). The RF drive causes a
small tilt of the quantization axis which leads to coherent precession
between @xmath and @xmath , if the RF frequency is adjusted to match the
qubit splitting. Finally, adjusting the phase of the excitation enables
the universal two-axis control in the rotating frame.

Larger number of electrons used to define a single qubit results in in
increased number of leakage states. Similarly to singlet-triplet qubit,
leakage to the states with different spin projection on the external
magnetic field direction does not pose a significant threat. However,
the state with @xmath , @xmath (labeled @xmath in Figs. 2.6 and 2.7 ) is
energetically split from the qubit states only when both @xmath , @xmath
, while the leakage to this state is driven by the gradients of the
Overhauser field.

The leakage becomes even more limiting when discussing the two qubit
gates realized by means of the exchange interaction. In principle it is
possible ⁵ ⁵ 5 experimentally it is virtually impossible to exploit the
exchange interaction for the two qubit gates but the this requires very
tuning of multiple exchanges at the same time [ 53 ] (while not being
able to measure them separately) or performing very long sequences to
suppress leakage [ 54 ] .

In principle it is also possible to use a dipole moment to couple such
qubits using dipole-dipole interaction or via superconducting cavity [
55 ] but the required coherence time are currently far beyond the
experimental state of the art.

##### 2.3.4 Hybrid (three-electron double dot) qubit

The final implementation of the quantum dot based spin qubit is the
so-called hybrid qubit, realized in a three-electron double quantum dot.
Similarly to exchange-only and resonant exchange qubit it is defined in
@xmath , @xmath subspace of the three-spin system [ 56 ] . However it is
operated in the regime of where two of the electrons are located on the
first dot (with smaller level spacing) while the third one resides on
another dot (with larger level spacing). This results in the qubit
eigenstates @xmath and @xmath being split by the level spacing in the
dot containing two electrons.

The qubit benefits from the fact that the level spacing that defining
the qubit splitting in the idle configuration (green in Fig. 2.8 ) is
virtually insensitive to small changes in gate voltages, in particular
is insensitive to charge noise ⁶ ⁶ 6 To the best of my knowledge the
literature [ 57 , 58 , 56 , 59 , 60 ] does not mention the possibility
of the leakage from the qubit space to the single state with @xmath and
@xmath , i.e. @xmath . The leakage to that state is driven by the
gradient of the Overhauser field which is not suppressed by any
mechanism. One can observe that the operation position of the hybrid
qubit is analogous to the extreme (1,0,2) configuration of exchange-only
qubit, where @xmath and @xmath state are degenerate (Fig. 2.6 ). The
coherence time measured in Refs. [ 58 , 59 , 60 ] is below the timescale
related to the leakage and therefore does not provide an experimental
counterevidence to the leakage. . On the other hand, inducing the
exchange interaction with the third electron results in a change of the
eigenstates and enables the universal qubit control [ 58 ] . At the same
time, large level spacing in the dot that is usually occupied by a
single electron enables initialization and readout in the manner
analogous to the exchange-only qubit.

The fact that the hybrid qubit consists of the three electrons allows to
employ most of the two qubit exchange-based coupling schemes from
exchange-only qubit. Additionally, the qubit splitting given by the
level spacing, which can effectively suppress some of the leakage paths
[ 56 ] . At the same time the definition of this qubit in the double dot
also enable the use of a dipole moment in a manner analogous to the
singlet-triplet qubit.

## Part II Symmetric operation of spin qubits

### Chapter 3 The principle of symmetrization

Charge noise poses a huge obstacle in the development of spin qubits.
Depending on the qubit implementation it can affect about every
parameter that is used to tune the qubit frequency. For example it
affects the Zeeman splitting and the EDSR drive strength by moving the
electrons wavefunction in the gradient of the external magnetic field [
19 , 18 ] or effectively modifying the g-factor [ 61 , 15 ] . The charge
noise effects are most pronounced whenever the exchange interaction is
induced between the two neighboring electrons. The exchange interaction
arises from the combination of the Pauli exclusion principle and the
Coulomb interaction or confinement of the electrons. Crucially, in the
presence of exchange different spin states of the two electrons are
characterized by different charge distributions which opens the channel
for the electric noise to affect the spins.

#### 3.1 Coupling of the charge noise to the tilted double quantum dot

The canonical example of how the charge noise affects the exchange
interaction strength is the two-electron double quantum dot (Fig. 3.1
a), where the exchange @xmath is induced by the potential tilt. The tilt
is realized by changing the difference between the gate voltages
controlling the occupancies of the two dots ( @xmath axis in the charge
diagram presented in Fig. 3.1 b). Figure 3.1 c shows a schematic energy
diagram of the two-electron charge-spin states in the vicinity of the
charge transition between (2,0) and (1,1) occupancies [ 62 ] , where
@xmath indicates the number of the electrons in the left and the right
dot. The lines indicated with the strong contrast correspond to the low
energy singlet @xmath and unpolarized triplet @xmath states which are to
be controlled. For large positive values of the detuning @xmath the two
electrons reside on different dots and are virtually decoupled. In
particular the exchange splitting @xmath between @xmath and @xmath
states is equal to zero and completely insensitive to charge noise. In
these conditions other decoherence mechanisms, such as Overhauser noise
(Part. III ), dominate the dephasing.

In the large negative @xmath limit (the two electrons residing on a
single quantum dot) @xmath and @xmath states are split by
(approximately) the spacing between the ground and a first excited
orbital of the quantum dot. That is the case since in a singlet
configuration both electrons occupy the ground orbital, while in the
triplet configuration one of the electrons is forced to occupy excited
orbital due to Pauli exclusion principle. This splitting, typically of
the order of several gigahertz (depending on the material and the size
of the dot) is only weakly susceptible to charge noise. The
insensitivity is a consequence of the fact that the difference in the
charge distribution corresponding to different orbitals in the same dot
is very small. The residual susceptibility to noise, which is not a
current concern of the community and is beyond the scope of this thesis,
arises due to the dependence of the level spacing on the changes in the
confining potential.

For the intermediate values of @xmath the exchange interaction strength
gradually increases. Starting from large @xmath , first the singlet
state changes the character from (1,1) to (2,0). This leads to an
increase of both, the singlet-triplet splitting (Fig. 3.1 d) and the the
difference in the charge distribution between these two states. The
latter implies an increase of the susceptibility to the charge noise
(Fig. 3.1 d), since the local variation of the confining potential will
affect the two spin states to a different extent. As @xmath becomes more
negative, the triplet states also change character from (1,1) to (2,0).
Consequently the difference in charge distribution between singlet and
triplet states is reduced and susceptibility to noise decreases.

#### 3.2 Detuning noise

The quantitative analysis of the decoherence usually assumes that the
characteristic length scale of the charge noise is larger than the
physical size of the double quantum dot. Since the level spacing within
dots and the tunnel coupling are invariant with respect to global shifts
of the potential, it follows that the tilts of the potential are the
dominant kind of noise affecting the singlet triplet splitting. For that
reason the noise can be effectively represented as an uncertainty in the
detuning control parameter @xmath .

Considering the effective quasistatic detuning noise, characterized by
the rms value @xmath , we observe that the susceptibility to the charge
noise is given by the derivative of the singlet-triplet splitting with
respect to detuning @xmath (Fig. 3.1 d). The resulting formula for the
decoherence time due to charge noise is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the rms exchange noise, turns out to be very accurate
whenever the exchange interaction in a double quantum dot is induced by
the tilt of the potential [ 12 , 63 , 64 ] .

Such a basic model provides a simple recipe for reducing the dephasing
while performing the exchange oscillations – to reduce the dependence of
the exchange @xmath on the detuning at the operating position. The
energy diagram and the plot of exchange strength with respect to
detuning @xmath (Fig. 3.1 c,d) reveals two such regions, mentioned in
the previous section. These are deep Coulomb blockade in (1,1) and (2,0)
charge configuration. However both of them present significant
disadvantages.

When operating in the (2,0) configuration the oscillations have such a
large frequency ( @xmath GHz) that conventionally used arbitrary
waveform generators (with @xmath GHz bandwidth) do not provide
sufficient control to perform rotations by a small angle and take
advantage of high fidelity oscillations. On the other hand in the (1,1)
charge configuration the exchange interaction is virtually 0, and no
exchange oscillations take place.

The symmetrization principle is the variation to the latter of this
approache, where the reduction of the exchange strength is compensated
by an increase in the tunnel coupling to reach required strength of the
exchange interaction.

#### 3.3 The symmetrization principle

We will begin by proving that for a double quantum dot there exists a
value of the detuning @xmath for which the susceptibility to detuning
noise @xmath . For that purpose we observe that, starting in the (1,1)
electron configuration, exchange interaction can be increased by tilting
the potential either towards the (2,0) or (0,2) electron configuration.
In the first of these cases the exchange increases for decreasing @xmath
, that is @xmath , while in the second case @xmath . By continuity of
@xmath there must be exist a value of @xmath for which the
susceptibility to the detuning noise vanishes.

Interestingly, one can also show easily that the point with vanishing
susceptibility lies exactly in the center of the (1,1) region, provided
that the level spacing of each of the dots is much larger than the
tunnel coupling. This can be most easily seen when the tunnel coupling
@xmath is much smaller than the energy difference between singlet states
consisting of two singly occupied dots @xmath and singlet states
consisting of the one doubly occupied dots: @xmath and @xmath . In this
approximation the energy of the triplet state @xmath is 0, while the
energy of the singlet state @xmath is slightly reduced due to admixtures
of singlets with doubly occupied dots

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the tilde symbol indicates the energy that includes the first
order correction due to the tunneling @xmath between the dots. Energy
differences can be expressed in terms of the detuning between single
particle levels in the two dots ¹ ¹ 1 note that here we use the
theoretical definition of detuning @xmath (the difference of the
energies of the two single particle orbitals) rather than experimental
definition in terms of gate voltages @xmath and charging energies of the
two dots @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

The symmetry of this formula implies that @xmath has an extremum at
@xmath , which is exactly in the middle between the (2,0)-(1,1) charge
transition (which lies at @xmath ) and the (1,1)-(0,2) charge transition
(at @xmath ). Finally, within the validity range of our approximations
the splitting between singlet and triplet states at the symmetry point
can be tuned by adjusting the tunnel coupling.

This result can be extended to any array of singly-occupied
tunnel-coupled quantum dots which has no cycles (a cycle is a group of
dots between which the electron can tunnel in a circle, as opposed to
the tree-like structure; Fig. 3.2 ). To prove that we start with a
double quantum dot and a new dots, one by one, to the existing array. In
an array without a cycle the new dot is always tunnel coupled to only
one of the old dots. Therefore we can adjust the detuning (and find the
noise-insensitive point for the newly introduced exchange interaction)
by setting correctly the single particle energy in the new dot. In the
limit of small tunnel couplings this does not influence the fine tuning
of all other exchange interactions in the array. One can also observe
that in such case the noise-insensitive point lies in the geometrical
center of the region with each dot being singly occupied. Notably it is
irrelevant whether the tunnel couplings between pairs of dots are
identical.

The two particular examples of the dot array without a cycle are: (a)
the three-electron triple quantum dot, in which one can implement the
resonant exchange or exchange-only qubit [ 65 , 66 ] , and (b) a central
quantum dot surrounded by three tunnel-coupled dots, which is a basis of
the proposed exchange-only singlet-only qubit [ 67 ] .

This theoretical result has two limitations for practical applications.
First, the control of the quantum dots is performed by means of gate
voltages that couple not only to the chemical potential of the closest
dot, but also to other dots, and to the tunnel couplings. Second, the
charge noise couples to the tunnel couplings.

#### 3.4 Effective gate voltage noise

The tunnel couplings, controlled by dedicated gates, are the second knob
the experimentalist has to tune the array of the quantum dot, next to
the chemical potential of the dots (in particular – detuning). It is
also the second most significant channel through which the charge noise
affects the splitting between the singlet and triplet configuration of
the electron pairs, and the one that dominates when the detuning noise
is suppressed by means of the symmetrization.

To include the tunnel coupling noise in an experimentally accessible
manner it is convenient to use the effective gate-voltage noise. It
relies on the assumption that the charge noise experienced by the qubit
is either an actual gate voltage noise, or that the potential
fluctuations have similar length scales to the changes in the potential
introduced by modifications of the gate voltages. In this model the
dephasing time due to the charge noise is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here the exchange splitting is considered to be a function of the vector
of the gate voltages applied on individual gates @xmath and @xmath is
the rms effective gate voltage noise. The susceptibility to the charge
noise is given by the gradient of the amplitude of the exchange at the
operating point @xmath .

Within this model a reduced sensitivity of the exchange splitting to the
charge noise is an experimental observation concerning tunability of the
chemical potentials and the tunnel coupling. For the typical GaAs
quantum dot devices the lever arm between the dedicated gate and the
chemical potential of the dot is much larger than the lever arm between
the gate voltage and the tunnel coupling. This observation implies that
the symmetric operation of the spin qubits is beneficial [ 64 , 68 ] .

#### 3.5 Experimentally finding the optimal working point

The ultimate question about the utility of the optimal symmetric
configurations concerns the experimental methods used to locate them.
This task is relatively easy in the case of the double quantum dot, but
its complexity increases very quickly for larger quantum dot arrays.

In the double dot there is only a single exchange splitting and its
value corresponds to the frequency of the exchange oscillations which
can be measured directly [ 7 ] . This enables, for example, to apply the
iterative gradient descent algorithm to converge to the optimal tuning.
Moreover, the dimensionality of the gate voltage space that needs to be
searched is relatively small (3) as the only relevant parameters that
can be adjusted are the chemical potentials of the two quantum dots and
the tunnel coupling between them. This enables a mapping out of the full
topography of the exchange splitting with respect to gate voltages with
only a few fingerprint measurements [ 68 ] (Sec. 6.8 ).

Neither of these approaches is directly applicable to the triple quantum
dot case (Ch. 5 ). The gradient descend approach does not work, because
one must simultaneously optimize two parameters (susceptibility to the
charge noise of the two exchange splittings) while being able to measure
only a combination of the two (the qubit splitting). On the other hand
the dimension of the parameter space in this problem increases to 5 (3
chemical potentials and two tunnel couplings) which makes it impossible
to fully map out the dependence of the qubit splitting with respect to
all gate voltages within a reasonable time.

In the study presented in chapter 5 we assumed that the experimentally
controlled @xmath and @xmath parameters (defined by Eq. 5.1 ) couple
only to the chemical potential of the dots. Moreover we decided to
equalize the two exchange splittings only approximately. With these two
simplifications the optimization procedure reduces to setting the
gradient of the qubit splitting with respect to @xmath and @xmath to
zero, while ensuring that the qubit splitting is nearly symmetric with
respect to flipping the sign of @xmath . This turned out to be
sufficient to reduce the susceptibility to the effective gate voltage
noise by one order of magnitude. Finding the approximate optimal points
in larger quantum dot arrays is most likely possible as well, but it
would require a much larger number of practical assumptions.

[width=0.8breakable, size=minimal, colback=white] We demonstrate a
substantial improvement in the spin-exchange gate using symmetric
control instead of conventional detuning in GaAs spin qubits, up to a
factor-of-six increase in the quality factor of the gate. For symmetric
operation, nanosecond voltage pulses are applied to the barrier that
controls the interdot potential between quantum dots, modulating the
exchange interaction while maintaining symmetry between the dots.
Excellent agreement is found with a model that separately includes
electrical and nuclear noise sources for both detuning and symmetric
gating schemes. Unlike exchange control via detuning, the decoherence of
symmetric exchange rotations is dominated by rotation-axis fluctuations
due to nuclear field noise rather than direct exchange noise.

#### 4.1 Introduction

Spin qubits, basic units of quantum information built from the spin
states of electrons in solid-state systems, are one of the most
promising realizations of a qubit [ 69 ] . This is due to their
potential for minituarization, scalability and fault tolerance [ 70 , 71
] . In fact, experiments in recent years have demonstrated remarkable
progress in the coherent manipulation of single- and multi-spin devices
[ 45 , 72 , 73 , 37 ] . Nevertheless, one of the main difficulties with
spin qubits, and more generally with solid-state qubits, is the
decoherence due to interactions with the environment. In the case of
electron spins confined in semiconductor quantum dots, two main types of
environmental noise limit coherence: electrical noise and hyperfine
interactions with nuclear spins in the surrounding lattice [ 74 , 12 ,
75 ] . To reach the high control fidelities necessary for quantum
computing, the coupling between a quantum dot spin qubit and its
environment can be reduced by the use of sweet spots [ 76 , 77 , 78 ] ,
and pulse errors can be reduced by bootstrap tomography [ 79 , 80 ] .

A crucial component of any spin-based quantum computing platform is
strong spin-spin interaction. In their seminal article, Loss and
DiVincenzo proposed that exchange interactions between electron spins
could be controlled by the height of the tunnel barrier between
neighboring quantum dots [ 5 ] . However, until recently this proposal
was not implemented in the laboratory, and instead exchange interactions
were induced by raising or lowering the potential of one dot relative to
the other, an approach referred to as tilt or detuning control [ 7 ] .
Unlike the dot-symmetric tunnel barrier control method, tilt control
affects the two dots asymmetrically and hybridizes the (1,1) and (0,2)
charge states. Here numbers within each parenthesis denote occupation
number of the left dot and right dot. In Fig. 4.1 (a) we illustrate the
difference between the two methods. Firstly, a singlet state (0,2)S is
prepared (P). Thereafter the electrons are adiabatically separated to
the @xmath state in the (1,1) charge configuration. At the exchange
point (X), a pulse is performed. For the tilt case, during this pulse
the wavefunctions of the electrons are brought together by
asymmetrically deforming the confining potential of the dots. In the
case of the symmetric mode of operation, the exchange interaction is
increased by lowering the potential barrier between the two dots.
Finally, reversing the slow adiabatic passage first projects the final
two-spin state onto @xmath and then maps it onto (0,2)S, which is then
read out at the measurement point (M).

In this Letter, we demonstrate rapid, high-quality exchange oscillations
implemented by pulsing the barrier between two dots, as envisioned in
the original Loss-DiVincenzo proposal. We also show that, unlike
tilt-induced qubit rotations, the coherence of barrier-induced rotations
is not limited by electrical detuning noise, but rather by nuclear spin
fluctuations parallel to the applied magnetic field. We quantify the
improvements by studying exchange oscillations within a singlet-triplet
qubit, corresponding to @xmath operations between the two spins.
Alternatively benchmarking of single-qubit gate fidelities is in
principle possible but requires nuclear programming [ 45 ] . Recent work
on surface acoustic waves and silicon triple quantum dots showed results
consistent with some of our observations [ 81 , 68 ] , indicating that
symmetric exchange finds applications beyond GaAs qubits.

#### 4.2 The device and pulse sequences

The double quantum dot device with integrated charge sensor [ 82 ] is
shown in Fig. 4.1 (b). The device was fabricated on a GaAs/AlGaAs
heterostructure 57 nm below the surface, producing a two-dimensional
electron gas with bulk density @xmath = @xmath m @xmath and mobility
@xmath = 230 m @xmath /Vs. To minimize stray capacitance a mesa was
patterned using electron-beam lithography and wet etching. Metallic
gates (Ti/Au) were deposited after atomic layer deposition of 10 nm HfO
@xmath , which allows both positive and negative gating, and obviates
gate-bias cooling [ 41 ] . All measurements were conducted in a dilution
refrigerator with mixing chamber temperature below 50 mK and in-plane
magnetic field @xmath mT applied perpendicular to the axis between dots.

Voltages pulses were applied via high-bandwidth coaxial lines to the
left and right plunger gates, @xmath , @xmath , and the barrier between
the dots, @xmath . In practice, to account for the small coupling
asymmetries, all three gates are involved in applying detuning @xmath
and symmetric barrier control @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -- -------
     @xmath         (4.1)
  -- -------- -- -- -------

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are DC offset voltages (see
Supplementary Material). Parameters @xmath and @xmath were determined
experimentally by mapping out the charge stability diagram. The value of
@xmath is consistent with previous experiments and sets the difference
between left and right dot electrochemical potential, whereas @xmath
keeps other charge states energetically unaccessible during @xmath
pulses.

Energy levels for the two-electron singlet S and triplet T @xmath states
as a function of detuning, @xmath , are shown in Figs. 1(c), along with
the pulse sequences for the tilt and symmetric operation modes in
Fig. 1(d). For both, tilt and symmetric operation, two electrons are
prepared (P) in a singlet (0,2)S state and, by slowly ramping @xmath to
(1,1), the system is initialized (I) into the ground state of the
nuclear Overhauser field, either @xmath or @xmath . For tilt operation,
the exchange pulse, @xmath , is applied by detuning to the exchange (X)
point @xmath for a duration @xmath , inducing rotations between @xmath
and @xmath . For symmetric operation, the exchange pulse is applied by
pulsing the middle gate to @xmath .

#### 4.3 Exchange oscillations

Two-dimensional images of exchange oscillations, controlled by either
tilt [Fig. 4.2 (a)] or symmetric operation near the midpoint of (1,1)
[Fig. 4.2 (b)], show a striking difference in quality. In both images,
each pixel represents the singlet return probability, @xmath , measured
from an ensemble of @xmath single-shot measurements. Each single-shot
measurement is assigned a binary value by comparing the reflectometery
signal at the measurement (M) point, integrated for @xmath @xmath s, to
a fixed threshold [ 82 , 83 ] . Figure 4.2 (c) shows exchange
oscillations using both tilt and exchange. This image is generated by
applying a tilt pulse of amplitude @xmath (of either sign) along with a
fixed symmetric pulse @xmath mV for a duration @xmath . As @xmath is
increased @xmath also increases, producing a chevron-like pattern
centered around the sweet spot @xmath that occurs in the middle of the
(1,1) charge state. Defining a quality factor, @xmath , to be the number
of oscillations before the amplitude decays to @xmath of its initial
value, we measure @xmath at the symmetry point, @xmath ¹ ¹ 1 Fig. 4.2
(c) shows that barrier-induced exchange oscillations have high quality
factors for a wide range of operating points @xmath near the sweet spot.
For example, data shown in Fig. 4.2 (b) was obtained at @xmath mV, which
for practical purposes we also classify as symmetric operation. .

The oscillation frequency of @xmath gives a direct measure of @xmath at
the exchange point X. Interestingly, the frequency does not depend on
the Overhauser field, even when it is comparable in size to @xmath [ 84
] . Figures 4.3 (a) and (b) show a set of experimental exchange
oscillations representative of the tilt and symmetric operation mode,
respectively. @xmath extracted from such oscillations is shown in the
insets. Consistent with previous observations [ 7 , 63 ] , tilt-induced
exchange oscillations result in @xmath independent of @xmath . On the
other hand, for the symmetric mode, @xmath increases with @xmath for the
range measured of 40 MHz @xmath 700 MHz. This is in agreement with
recent results in singlet-triplet qubits fabricated in the Si/SiGe
heterostructures [ 68 ] . Much higher values of Q can be obtained by
tilting the double dot potential so far that both S and T @xmath states
share the same (0,2) charge state [ 12 ] . However, it is unclear if
qubit operations at frequencies of tens of GHz are practical.

#### 4.4 Noise quantification

To quantify the noise sensitivity of the symmetric exchange gate as well
as gain insight into why it outperforms exchange by detuning, we compare
both methods to a simple model that includes both nuclear Overhauser
gradient noise and voltage noise on the detuning and barrier gates.
Noise is assumed gaussian and quasistatic on the timescale of the
exchange oscillations. Nuclear noise is characterized by a mean
longitudinal Overhauser gradient energy @xmath between dots, with
standard deviation @xmath . Exchange noise is assumed to result from
voltage noise on left and right plungers and the barrier, with mean
exchange energy @xmath with standard deviation @xmath . The model also
accounts for triplet-to-singlet relaxation at the measurement point,
with a relaxation time @xmath during the measurement interval of length
@xmath . Within this model, the singlet return probability @xmath over
both noise ensembles is given by [ 84 ] :

  -- -- -- -------
           (4.2)
  -- -- -- -------

where @xmath is the tilt of the qubit rotation axis during an exchange
pulse due to the Overhauser field gradient [ 84 ] , @xmath and @xmath .

The black solid lines in Fig. 4.3 , together with the insets in Figs.
4.2 (a), (b) and (c), are generated by evaluating Eq. ( 4.2 )
numerically. Two fit parameters per curve are the oscillation frequency
@xmath and a horizontal offset associated with the rise time of the
waveform generator. All other parameters were obtained from independent
measurements: The Overhauser energy gradient fluctuations, @xmath MHz,
was obtained by measuring the distribution of free induction decay
frequencies [ 75 ] over a 30 min. interval and fitting the distribution
to a gaussian.

The saturation of the singlet return probability, @xmath , at long
@xmath , denoted @xmath , will deviate from @xmath = 0.5 in the presence
of a nonzero mean Overhauser field gradient, @xmath , or finite
relaxation time, @xmath . Fitting the @xmath dependence of @xmath [Fig.
4.4 (a)], yields fit values @xmath @xmath s and @xmath MHz.

Exchange noise @xmath is obtained by assuming (i) all noise is gate
noise, (ii) noise on different gates is independent: @xmath . In giving
all three components equal weight, we have further assumed that all
three gates are equally noisy as quantified by the parameter @xmath .
Taking into account the definitions in Eq. ( 4.1 ) we obtain:

  -- -- -- -------
           (4.3)
  -- -- -- -------

The derivatives are calculated from a phenomenological smooth exchange
profile @xmath fitted to a discrete map of @xmath measured at various
operating points (see chapter 6 ). The effective gate noise @xmath is
extracted from tilt exchange oscillations measured in a regime where
effective detuning noise dominates, giving @xmath mV (see Supplementary
Material). This value, together with Eq. 4.3 , determines @xmath used in
all simulations, and yields excellent agreement with data.

The origin of the improved electrical performance becomes apparent when
comparing the required pulse amplitudes for symmetric and tilted
operation for a given @xmath [Fig. 4.4 (b)]. Although the dependences of
@xmath and @xmath on @xmath are similar, the range of @xmath is
significantly smaller than @xmath . Note in Fig. 4.4 (b) that @xmath
changes from 0.1 to 0.3 GHz for a @xmath 3 mV change in @xmath , or a
@xmath 30 mV change in @xmath [see Fig. 4.4 (b)]. Because of this
difference in derivatives of @xmath with respect to @xmath and @xmath ,
the symmetric operation has much less noise for a given noise in the
gate voltages.

The contributions of nuclear and electrical noise to limiting the
quality factor @xmath of and dephasing time, @xmath , comparing
experiment and model, is shown in Figs. 4.4 (c) and (d). Note that for
detuning (tilt) operation, electrical noise dominates above @xmath GHz,
so that going any faster (using larger @xmath ) just makes the exchange
noise greater in proportion, limiting the number of oscillations to
@xmath . For symmetric exchange, on the other hand, electrical noise
doesn’t dominate until above @xmath GHz, resulting in a monotonically
increasing quality factor up to @xmath GHz. From the model, we find
@xmath as high as 50, 8 times larger than in the conventional tilt
operation mode. Finally, we note that the origin of the effective
electrical noise may be within the sample and not in the
instrumentation. To distinguish actual voltage fluctuations on the gate
electrodes (due to instrumentation) from intrinsic noise source (e.g.
two-phonon processes [ 85 ] ), further studies including temperature
dependence are needed.

#### 4.5 Summary

In summary, we have investigated experimentally and modeled the
application of an exchange gate applied by opening the middle barrier at
a symmetry point of a two-electron spin qubit system instead of the
conventional method, which is to detune the potential. The model allows
the influences of nuclear and electrical noise to be disentangled for
both symmetric and detuning exchange control, and is in excellent
agreement with experimental data. We find that symmetric mode of control
is significantly less sensitive to electrical noise due to the symmetric
arrangement, making exchange only quadratically sensitive to detuning
gate voltage noise. With this new symmetric control method, we were able
to increase the quality factor of coherent oscillations from around 6 to
35, and expect that improvements beyond @xmath are possible by further
increasing @xmath . The corresponding enhancement of coherence times by
nearly an order of magnitude will also benefit other single- and
multi-qubit implementations that rely on exchange interactions [ 21 ] .

[width=0.8breakable, size=minimal, colback=white] We operate a resonant
exchange qubit in a highly symmetric triple-dot configuration using
IQ-modulated RF pulses. At the resulting three-dimensional sweet spot
the qubit splitting is an order of magnitude less sensitive to all
relevant control voltages, compared to the conventional operating point,
but we observe no significant improvement in the quality of Rabi
oscillations. For weak driving this is consistent with Overhauser field
fluctuations modulating the qubit splitting. For strong driving we infer
that effective voltage noise modulates the coupling strength between RF
drive and the qubit, thereby quickening Rabi decay. Application of CPMG
dynamical decoupling sequences consisting of up to @xmath @xmath pulses
significantly prolongs qubit coherence, leading to marginally longer
dephasing times in the symmetric configuration. This is consistent with
dynamical decoupling from low frequency noise, but quantitatively cannot
be explained by effective gate voltage noise and Overhauser field
fluctuations alone. Our results inform recent strategies for the
utilization of partial sweet spots in the operation and long-distance
coupling of triple-dot qubits.

The version of the article presented in the thesis is supplemented with
the derivation of the formula for the Rabi decay time (Sec. 5.6 ).

#### 5.1 Introduction

Spin qubits are widely investigated for applications in quantum
computation [ 5 , 7 , 37 , 8 , 87 , 21 , 22 ] , with several operational
choices depending on whether the qubit is encoded in the spin state of
one [ 8 , 87 , 21 , 18 , 15 , 19 ] , two [ 7 , 37 , 45 , 22 ] or three
electrons [ 48 , 88 , 50 , 52 , 58 , 51 , 65 ] . In particular, spin
qubits encoded in three-electron triple quantum dots allow universal
electrical control with voltage pulses, and enable integration with
superconducting cavities [ 89 , 90 , 91 , 92 , 55 , 23 ] . Multi-qubit
coupling via superconducting cavities, however, is challenging due to
the effects of environmental noise on resonant exchange (RX) qubits [ 52
, 55 ] . A recent approach to improve coherence times is the operation
at sweet spots, where the qubit splitting is to first order insensitive
to most noisy parameters [ 64 , 68 , 65 , 66 ] . Here, we operate a
symmetric resonant exchange (SRX) qubit in which the qubit splitting is
highly insensitive to all three single-particle energies [ 66 ] , and
compare its performance to its conventional configuration as a RX qubit
[ 52 , 49 ] .

#### 5.2 RX and SRX qubit

We configure a triple-quantum-dot device either as a SRX or RX qubit by
appropriate choice of gate voltages. Gate electrodes are fabricated on a
doped, high-mobility GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well, and the triple dot is
located @xmath nm below three circular portions of the accumulation gate
(Fig. 5.1 a). The occupation of the dots is controlled on nanosecond
timescales by voltage pulses on gates @xmath , where @xmath refers to
the left/middle/right plunger gate (LP/MP/RP) or left/right barrier gate
(LB/RB). Radio frequency (RF) bursts for resonant qubit control are
applied to the left plunger gate. The conductance through the proximal
sensor dot is sensitive to the charge occupation of the triple quantum
dot, allowing qubit readout (see below).

In the presence of an in-plane magnetic field, @xmath mT in this
experiment, the triple-dot qubit is defined by the two three-electron
spin states with total spin @xmath and spin projection @xmath [ 48 , 52
, 49 , 65 ] . Ignoring normalization, these spin states can be
represented by @xmath and @xmath . Here, arrows indicate the spin of the
electron located in the left, middle and right quantum dot. Note that
the spin state of @xmath and @xmath is, respectively, symmetric and
antisymmetric under exchange of the outer two electrons. In the presence
of interdot tunneling this exchange symmetry affects hybridization of
the associated orbital wavefunctions, splitting @xmath and @xmath by
@xmath (where @xmath is Planck’s constant and @xmath sets the frequency
of the qubit’s rotating frame). Similarily, an additional triple-dot
state with @xmath and @xmath is split from the qubit states due to
interdot tunneling. All other triple-dot states have different @xmath
and are energetically separated from the qubit states due to the Zeeman
effect.

In the conventional operating regime of the RX qubit (Fig. 5.1 c) the
(111) charge state of the triple dot is hybridized weakly with charge
states (201) and (102) (here number triplets denote the charge occupancy
of the triple dot). This lowers the energy of @xmath with respect to
@xmath and makes the resulting qubit splitting sensitive to detuning of
the central dot, @xmath (cf. Fig. 5.1 b,e) [ 52 ] . The qubit splitting
is, however, to first order insensitive to detuning between the outer
dots, @xmath , [ 49 ] , reflecting that tunneling across left and right
barrier contribute equally to the qubit splitting (Fig. 5.1 c,e). Qubit
rotations in the rotating frame are implemented by applying RF bursts to
gate @xmath , such that the operating point oscillates around @xmath .
When the RF frequency matches the qubit splitting, the qubit nutates
between @xmath and @xmath , allowing universal control using IQ
modulation [ 52 ] . When the detuning of the outer dots is ramped
towards (201), @xmath maps to a singlet state of the left pair ( @xmath
, see first terms in @xmath ), whereas @xmath remains in the (111)
charge state due to the Pauli exclusion principle [ 48 , 50 , 52 ] .
This spin-to-charge conversion allows us to perform single-shot readout
on microsecond timescales, by monitoring a proximal sensor dot using
high-bandwidth reflectometry [ 9 ] . In this work we estimate the
fraction of singlet outcomes, @xmath , by averaging 1000-10000
single-shot readouts.

In the case of the SRX qubit, however, all three single-particle levels
are aligned, and the (111) state hybridizes with the charge states
(201), (102), (120) and (021) [ 66 ] . This introduces additional
symmetries between the tunneling of the electron from the central dot to
the outer dots and tunneling of the outer electrons to the central dot
(Fig. 5.1 d). As a consequence, the qubit splitting is expected to be
insensitive to first order to both @xmath and @xmath (Fig. 5.1 e) as
well as to the barrier detuning, @xmath (introduced below). Due to the
required alignment of single-particle levels, hybridization is
suppressed by the charging energy within each dot (indicated by the
large energy spacing between solid and dashed lines in Fig. 5.1 c,d).
Accordingly, we find that much larger tunnel couplings have to be tuned
up to maintain a significant qubit splitting. In practice, the gate
voltage configuration needed to achieve a SRX qubit splitting of a few
hundred megahertz does no longer allow spin-to-charge conversion solely
by a ramp of @xmath . Therefore, we also apply voltage pulses to the
barrier gates when ramping the qubit between the operation configuration
(indicated by superscript @xmath ) and readout configuration (see
below).

Figure 5.2 a ( 5.2 b) defines the pulse cycle used for spectroscopy and
operation of the RX (SRX) qubit. Taking into account the physical
symmetries of the device (cf. Fig. 5.1 ), control parameters @xmath are
specified in terms of gate voltages @xmath ,

  -- -- -- -------
           (5.1)
  -- -- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the power ( @xmath ), duration ( @xmath ), frequency ( @xmath ) and
phase of the IQ-modulated RF burst. The operating point of the SRX
qubit, defined by @xmath , was chosen to yield a qubit frequency of
530 MHz ¹ ¹ 1 ( @xmath ) = (-1.53, -0.14, -1.05, -0.15, -0.83) V. . The
operating point of the RX qubit, located at @xmath , was chosen to yield
a comparable qubit frequency of 510 MHz. The linear ramps before (after)
the RF burst facilitate initialization (readout) of the qubit state via
an adiabatic conversion of a two-electron spin singlet state in the left
dot. For the RX qubit @xmath all remain zero throughout the pulse cycle,
i.e. the operation and readout configuration differ only in detuning
@xmath (Fig. 5.2 a). In contrast, to adiabiatically connect the
initialization/readout point of the SRX qubit to its operating point, we
found it necessary to vary @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath during
the pulse cycle (Fig. 5.2 b), which involves voltage pulses on all five
gates indicated in Fig. 5.1 a.

#### 5.3 Qubit spectroscopy and Rabi oscillations

Qubit spectroscopy performed in the vicinity of the operating point
quantitatively reveals each qubit’s symmetries and susceptibilities to
gate voltage fluctuations. First, maps as in Fig 5.3 a are acquired by
repeating a pulse cycle with @xmath ns fixed, and plotting the fraction
of singlet readouts, @xmath , as a function of @xmath , while stepping
the control parameters along five orthogonal axes that intersect with
the operating point. The qubit frequency @xmath is extracted from the
center of the dominant @xmath resonance (cf. red circles in Fig 5.3 a),
and plotted as a function of @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath (Fig. 5.3 b-f). Indeed, the dependence of @xmath on @xmath
reveals that the SRX qubit splitting is to first order insensitive to
@xmath , in contrast to the conventional RX qubit (Fig. 5.3 b). Further,
we observe that both qubits show a sweet spot with respect to @xmath and
@xmath (Fig. 5.3 c,d), indicating that the symmetry breaking associated
with @xmath is analogues to the well-known symmetry breaking associated
with @xmath [ 49 ] . Interestingly, for both detuning parameters, the
curvature of the qubit splitting is significantly smaller for the SRX
configuration, compared to the RX configuration. Moreover, the SRX qubit
frequency is also significantly less susceptible to changes in
parameters @xmath and @xmath , compared to the conventional RX qubit
(Fig. 5.3 e,f), corroborating the potential use of this highly symmetric
configuration for prolonging qubit coherence.

The qubit spectra from Figures 5.3 allow us to quantify the
susceptibility of the qubit splitting to gate voltage fluctuations, by
evaluating

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

for both operating points. For the SRX qubit we find a susceptibility to
gate noise ( @xmath MHz/mV) that is one order of magnitude smaller
compared to the RX qubit ( @xmath MHz/mV). For the linear coupling
regime this means that voltage fluctuations on gate electrodes,
including instrumentation noise propagating on the cryostats wideband
transmission lines, are expected to be much less detrimental to the SRX
qubit than to the RX qubit.

Next we investigate whether the reduced noise susceptibility of the SRX
qubit results in improved Rabi oscillations (Fig. 5.4 ). To achieve a
comparable Rabi frequency, @xmath , we find that @xmath needs to be 10
dB larger for the SRX qubit compared to the RX qubit, consistent with
the smaller curvatures observed in Fig. 5.3 . However, only for high
@xmath do we observe improvement in SRX qubit performance relative to
the RX qubit. For quantitative comparison we fit an exponentially damped
cosine to @xmath for each RF power. Figure 5.4 c parametrically plots
the extracted @xmath decay time ( @xmath ) and quality factor ( @xmath )
of Rabi oscillations as a function of @xmath . For @xmath MHz the
quality of SRX Rabi oscillations is comparable to the RX qubit, while
for @xmath MHz @xmath and @xmath are enhanced by approximately 50%,
relative to the RX qubit.

The marginal performance improvement observed for the SRX qubit can be
analyzed quantitatively by extending theory from Ref. [ 49 ] to include
the dependence of the Rabi oscillations decay time @xmath on the Rabi
frequency @xmath . Assuming quasistatic gate-voltage noise and
quasistatic nuclear spin noise, we derive

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath quantifies the rms deviation of @xmath from @xmath due to
effective voltage flucuations and Overhauser field fluctuations
(discussed below). The quantity @xmath captures the effect of voltage
fluctuations on the coupling strength of the RF drive

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath being the standard deviation of the fluctuating paramater
@xmath and @xmath being the lever arm between amplitude of the RF drive
and the qubit nutation speed in the rotating frame. We find that the
observed @xmath is well fitted by our theoretical model, using @xmath
(0.22) for the SRX (RX) qubit and a common value @xmath (solid lines in
Fig. 5.4 c). Although Ref. [ 49 ] formally identified @xmath with

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

(here @xmath and @xmath are symmetry-adapted exchange energies arising
from exchange @xmath between central and left/right dot), its
implications for the properties of the @xmath term and associated Rabi
coherence were not considered. Equations ( 5.5 ),( 5.6 ) would in
principle allow the extraction of voltage noise in more detail, but
experimentally the partial derivatives are not easily accessible.
However, by plotting the expected limit of @xmath if only detuning noise
(black dash-dotted line) or only drive noise (red and blue dashed lines)
is modeled, we deduce that the dominating contribution to @xmath arises
not from effective gate voltage noise, but from fluctuations of the
Overhauser gradient between dots. Assigning @xmath entirely to
Overhauser fluctuations, we estimate the rms Overhauser field in each
dot to be approximately 4.2 mT, in good agreement with previous work on
GaAs triple dots [ 52 , 93 ] .

The detrimental effect of fluctuating Overhauser fields on qubit
dephasing is not surprising, given that the qubit states are encoded in
the @xmath spin texture: For @xmath the spin angular momentum resides in
the outer two dots, whereas for @xmath it resides in the central dot.
This makes the qubit splitting to first order sensitive to Overhauser
gradients between the central and outer dots [ 49 ] . Equation 5.6
further suggests that the qubit drive strength depends on @xmath , which
likely is first-order-sensitive to both @xmath and @xmath , and hence we
suspect that @xmath , unlike @xmath , remains sensitive to the charge
noise. These conclusions suggest that triple-dot qubits will benefit
from implementation in nuclear-spin-free semiconductors, and possibly
from replacing IQ-control in the rotating frame by baseband voltage
pulses. Recent theoretical work indicates that this may allow efficient
two-qubit gates between neighboring qubits using exchange pulses [ 66 ]
and long-distance coupling via superconducting resonators [ 92 , 55 ] .

#### 5.4 Coherence under CPMG sequence

Finally, we test the prospect of the SRX qubit as a quantum memory,
using Hahn echo and CPMG sequences consisting of relatively strong (
@xmath ns) @xmath -pulses (defined in Fig. 5.5 a). These dynamical
decoupling sequences are particularly effective against nuclear noise [
74 , 94 ] , which is known to display relative long correlation times [
95 , 82 , 96 ] . Figure 5.5 shows the resulting coherence time, @xmath ,
for different qubit frequencies, for up to @xmath =32 pulses. Values for
@xmath were extracted from Gaussian fits to @xmath , where @xmath is the
total dephasing time. For small number of @xmath -pulses we see no
difference in the performance of the RX and SRX qubit, indicating that
effective voltage noise (incl. instrumentation noise on gate electrodes)
is not limiting coherence. Qualitatively, this may point towards
high-frequency Overhauser fluctuations playing a dominant role, although
we find coherence times significantly shorter than expected from nuclear
spin noise alone [ 7 , 74 , 96 ] and values reported for RX qubits [ 52
] . While @xmath strongly depends on the qubit frequency, the ratio
@xmath is roughly independent of @xmath (not shown). This is reminiscent
of gate defined quantum dots that showed a nearly exponential dependence
of the exchange splitting on relevant control voltages [ 63 , 21 , 12 ,
52 , 64 , 68 ] .

Although we do not know the exact origin of the effective noise observed
here and in previous work [ 52 , 50 ] , we note that the overall noise
levels need to be reduced by several orders of magnitude to allow
high-fidelity entangling gates [ 55 ] . As a cautionary advice against
the overuse of partial sweet spots, we note that for any qubit tuned
smoothly by @xmath (in our work five) gate voltages one can always
(i.e., for any operating point) define at least @xmath (in our work 4)
independent control parameters that to first order do not influence the
qubit splitting. This underlines the importance of careful analysis of
noise sources and noise correlations [ 97 ] in determining optimal
working points of qubits [ 98 ] .

For the 530 MHz tuning the SRX qubit appears to outperform the RX qubit
for @xmath , indicating that the spectral noise density at higher
frequencies, filtered by the CMPG sequence [ 99 , 100 , 101 , 94 ] , may
indeed be reduced for the SRX qubit. The scaling of @xmath with (even)
number of pulses appears to follow a power law. Although the exponent
(0.77 @xmath 0.07) for the SRX data is consistent with values reported
for RX qubits [ 52 ] , a spectral interpretation may need to take into
account unconventional decoherence processes that can occur at sweet
spots, such as non-Gaussian noise arising from quadratic coupling to
Gaussian distributed noise and the appearance of linear coupling to
noise arising from low-frequency fluctuations around a sweet spot [ 102
, 98 ] .

#### 5.5 Conclusions

In conclusion, we have operated a triple-dot resonant exchange qubit in
a highly symmetric configuration. At the three-dimensional sweet spot
the overall sensitivity of the qubit frequency to five control voltages
is reduced by an order of magnitude, but resonant operation of the qubit
is technically more demanding. For weak resonant driving the quality of
Rabi oscillations show no significant improvement due to the dominant
contributions of nuclear Overhauser gradients to fluctuations of the
qubit splitting, motivating the future use of nuclear-spin-free
semiconductors. For strongly driven Rabi oscillations and CPMG
decoupling sequences the coherence times are significantly shorter than
expected from instrumentation noise alone and Overhauser fluctuations,
suggesting that recent theory must be extended to include the dependence
of drive strength on control voltages. An optimization of gate lever
arms and materials’ charge noise may then allow non-resonant operation
of multi-qubit structures that take advantage of highly symmetric
configurations of triple-dot qubits.

#### 5.6 Unpublished: Derivation of the formula for the Rabi decay time

To derive a formula for the Rabi decay time (Eq. ( 5.4 ) and ( 5.5 )) we
start with the RX qubit splitting in the rotating frame

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

in units of angular frequency, where @xmath is the Rabi angular
frequency, @xmath is the Rabi drive, @xmath is the Rabi drive noise and
@xmath the noise in the detuning of the qubit frequency. From here we
can calculate noise of the Rabi angular frequency the lowest order

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

Assuming that the noise affecting the qubit frequency and the drive
strength are independent, and using the fact that @xmath we can convert
the above identity into relation between variances

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath indicates, respectively, the variance of the Rabi angular
frequency, drive and the qubit frequency. We neglect higher order
moments of @xmath distribution. Knowing @xmath we can write the formula
for the Rabi decay time

  -- -- -- --------
           (5.10)
  -- -- -- --------

What remains now is to analyze the origin of the noise in the drive
strength ( @xmath term) and in the qubit frequency ( @xmath term).

First we focus on the noise in the qubit frequency. The splitting
between the qubit states is [ 49 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath is the electron Zeeman splitting in the
left/middle/right dot including contributions from the Overhauser field.
We can safely assume that the electrical noise affecting the first term
(captured by @xmath ) and the nuclear noise affecting the second term
(captured by @xmath ) are independent and so

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

We represent the value of @xmath as a result of the effective gate
voltage noise ( @xmath ), and so its’ coupling to the qubit is
determined by the gradient of the qubit splitting with respect to gate
voltages

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

The sum in this formula is the equivalent of the susceptibility @xmath
defined in Eq. ( 5.3 ), up to @xmath factor between frequency and
angular frequency. To estimate @xmath we assume that the Overhauser
field in the three quantum dots is independent and characterized by the
same variance @xmath . This leads to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

As described in the main text, taking @xmath mT, which is consistent
with direct measurements of the Overhauser field in device of the same
geometry [ 96 ] (Fig. 10.2 c), and neglecting the charge noise
contribution is sufficient to explain the Rabi decay time for weak
driving.

To analyse the drive noise we first write down the Rabi drive as a
product of rf exciting voltage amplitude applied to the left plunger
gate @xmath and the lever arm to the qubit drive @xmath (defined in
Eq. ( 5.6 )) [ 49 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

This indicates that the drive strength can be affected either by the
noise in the driving rf voltage amplitude @xmath or in the lever arm
@xmath . We exclude the first possibility relying on two facts:
stability of the rf electronics and small power of the charge noise at
qubit frequency [ 12 ] . On the other hand the lever arm @xmath is a
function of exchange splittings and therefore is susceptible to the
effective gate voltage noise. Using these observation we can write down

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

Inserting Eq. ( 5.15 ) we finally get that the variance of the drive
noise is proportional to the drive

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

Substituting Eq. ( 5.17 ) to Eq. ( 5.10 ) leads to Eq. ( 5.4 ) and ( 5.5
).

#### 6.1 Relationship between control parameters @xmath, @xmath and gate
voltages @xmath, @xmath and @xmath

Here, we explain in more detail the actual voltage pulses employed for
qubit operation, and their relationship to control parameters for
detuning and barrier height.

Fig. 6.1 illustrates the pulse sequence. Before each exchange pulse the
qubit is prepared (P) in the eigenstate of the nuclear gradient field
(denoted @xmath ) using standard voltage pulses applied to the left and
right gate similar to earlier experiments [ 7 ] . These pulses realize
exchange of electrons with the reservoirs to reset a singlet (0,2)
state, a fast crossing of the @xmath - @xmath degeneracy to avoid
leakage into the @xmath state, and an adiabatic ramp to the (1,1) charge
state that maps the singlet state into the @xmath state (I). After each
exchange pulse the qubit is read out using standard voltage pulses
applied to the left and right gate electrodes. These involve an
adiabatic ramp and a fast crossing of the @xmath - @xmath degeneracy
that maps the @xmath qubit state into a (0,2) singlet state or the
@xmath qubit state into a (1,1) @xmath state. In the resulting
measurement configuration (M), the charge states (0,2) and (1,1) are
discriminated using single shot readout of the sensor quantum dot based
on rf reflectometry and thresholding of the demodulated rf voltage [ 82
] .

The exchange pulse itself differs from conventional operating schemes as
it involves fast voltage pulses applied to left, middle and right gate
electrodes ( @xmath , @xmath and @xmath in Fig. 6.1 ). For practical
reasons, low-frequency and high-frequency signals are transmitted to the
sample holder using twisted pairs and coax transmission lines,
respectively, and combine on the sample holder using home-built RC bias
tees. After each readout pulse we apply pulse compensation pulses such
that the time average of each coax voltage signal is equal to the
voltage of the coax signal just before the exchange pulse. This means
that the idling configuration of the qubit, characterized by voltages
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath , corresponds to the DC voltages of the twisted
pairs connected to the low-frequency input of the bias tees. This
ensures that the idling configuration of the qubit does not change
within a data set, even when changing amplitude or duration of the
exchange pulses.

In order to turn on a well-defined exchange splitting for a certain
amount of time it is convenient to construct voltage pulses ( @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath ) based on three control parameters @xmath , @xmath ,
and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where, @xmath and @xmath .

These equations show that the three parameters @xmath , @xmath , and
@xmath parameterize physically different manipulations of the (1,1)
charge configuration. Namely, @xmath controls the common mode of the
plunger gates (it appears with a plus sign in each equation) and brings
the (1,1) charge state, which is in deep Coulomb blockade, toward the
energy of the (2,2) or (0,0) charge states. In contrast, the detuning
parameter @xmath controls how much the double well potential is tilted
towards the (0,2) charge state ( @xmath ) or the (2,0) charge state (
@xmath ). The barrier height in the double well potential is controlled
by @xmath , which appears with a positive sign in the equation for
@xmath (i.e. positive @xmath corresponds to lower barrier
height/increased exchange splitting) and with a negative gain in @xmath
(in order to minimize its contribution to the common mode voltage).

For the symmetric operation of the exchange gate the choice of detuning
and barrier during the time of exchange rotation, ( @xmath , @xmath ),
are most important, as these parameters determine how much virtual
tunneling to (0,2) and (2,0) can occur (setting the speed of the
exchange gate), and how balanced these processes are (minimizing the
sensitivity to @xmath noise). The common mode voltage during the
exchange pulse, @xmath , as well as the detuning voltage after
initialization of the @xmath state, @xmath , have a much weaker effect
on the quality of observed exchange rotations, and therefore have not
been studied systematically. For the measurement presented in the main
text, we choose @xmath and @xmath mV.

#### 6.2 Extracting @xmath, @xmath and @xmath from @xmath

For each operating point of the exchange oscillation, @xmath , the
exchange interaction @xmath can be determined by measuring @xmath and
extracting the oscillation frequency. This method is justified even for
@xmath provided that @xmath represents an average over a sufficiently
large (quasistatic) ensemble characterized by @xmath . For our data
sets, which typically involve averaging times exceeding 10 minutes, this
condition is satisfied, and hence we do not have to take into account
nuclear contributions to the oscillation frequency of type @xmath [ 84 ]
.

Specifically, we extract the frequency of the exchange oscillations for
selected operating points [black lines in Fig. 6.2 (a)] in a two step
process. First we calculate the discrete Fourier transform of @xmath and
identify the main peak. Then we use the frequency associated with the
main peak as an initial guess for fitting a damped sine wave of
frequency @xmath to @xmath , with a decay of the form exp @xmath . The
quality factor is obtained using the relation @xmath . Values of @xmath
obtained by this method are plotted as symbols in Fig. 6.2 (d-g).

#### 6.3 Model of @xmath

The operating points ( @xmath ) associated with data presented in panels
Fig. 6.2 (d,e,f,g) fall onto a grid in the two-dimensional
barrier-detuning space, as shown by black lines in Fig. 6.2 (a). In
order to inspect the sensitivity of @xmath to small fluctuations in
@xmath and @xmath a two-dimensional model @xmath is needed.

Our phenomenological model of @xmath is given by:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Using parameters from Table 6.1 , this model provides an excellent
interpolation of @xmath in the gray shaded regions in Fig. 6.2 (a).
These two regions have been selected based on the insight that they
provide into the origin of the drastically different performance of
tilted exchange gates and symmetric exchange gates (cf. section 6.4
below). Comparing line cuts of the model @xmath with observed values of
@xmath shows that our numerical model of @xmath accurately captures the
observed exchange profile of the device [cuts of panels Fig. 6.2 (b,c)
are shown as solid lines in panels Fig. 6.2 (d,e,f,g)]. The next section
uses partial derivatives of this model to calculate the effects of
effective gate noise.

#### 6.4 Calculation of exchange noise @xmath, decoherence time @xmath,
and quality factor @xmath arising from quasistatic electrical noise
@xmath

In this section we describe how @xmath , and quality factor @xmath in
Fig. 4(c) and 4(d) in main text were calculated.

We disregard nuclear fluctuations and consider decoherence caused by
quasistatic effective gate noise only. Small fluctuations of control
parameters @xmath or @xmath result in fluctuations of @xmath with an
amplitude that is proportional to the partial derivative of @xmath with
respect to @xmath or @xmath . For comparison with other experiments, and
in order to model the decoherence due to electrical noise, it is useful
to express fluctuations of @xmath arising fo @xmath or @xmath noise in
terms of effective gate noise on @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath .

From Eq. 6.1 we obtain the following relations between partial
derivatives of @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

Assuming that the effective gate noise associated with @xmath , @xmath
and @xmath is quasistatic, independent, and Gaussian distributed with a
common standard deviation @xmath , i.e. @xmath , we can write the
expected fluctuations of @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

Averaging over a quasistatic, Gaussian ensemble of @xmath with standard
deviation @xmath yields a Gaussian decay envelope @xmath , a decoherence
time given by @xmath , and a quality factor given by @xmath [ 84 , 12 ]
. To generate the associated curves in Fig. 4.4 (c) and 4.4 (d) in the
main text we use @xmath = 0.18 mV, determined as described in the next
section.

#### 6.5 Determination of @xmath

We determine the effective gate noise @xmath by measuring tilt-induced
exchange oscillations in a regime where effective detuning noise @xmath
dominates, i.e. for @xmath = 84 mV. Fitting a sinusoid with a Gaussian
envelope, @xmath , yields @xmath ns. Using @xmath yields @xmath MHz.
Taking in account Equations 6.2 , 6.3 and 6.4 and Table 6.1 this value
corresponds to an effective gate noise @xmath = 0.18 mV.

#### 6.6 Comparison of electrical noise in tilt and symmetric operation

Application of Eq. 6.4 to the model @xmath shown in Fig. 6.2 (b) and (c)
allows us to calculate @xmath [Fig. 6.3 (a) and (b)]. To highlight the
difference in magnitude of @xmath between tilt and symmetric mode of
operation we use the same color scale for panels (a) and (b), and
compare two cuts plotted against @xmath in panel (c). This analysis
demonstrates that the same amount of effective gate noise ( @xmath
= 0.18 mV) results in exchange noise ( @xmath ) that is more than one
order of magnitude larger in the tilt mode of operation than the
symmetric mode of operation, for a given @xmath .

#### 6.7 Calculation of @xmath, @xmath

Here we describe how theoretical curves @xmath and @xmath in Figures
4(c,d) of the main text were calculated. These quantities represent the
contribution of nuclear noise to the total noise. First, exchange
oscillations were simulated using Eqs. 3 of the main text for both tilt
and symmetric mode of operations, similar to simulating insets shown in
Fig. 2(a) and (b) in the main text, but using @xmath while keeping all
other parameters unchanged. From these simulations, @xmath and @xmath
were extracted in the same way as @xmath and @xmath were extracted as
described in section 6.2 .

#### 6.8 Unpublished: Mapping of @xmath with exchange pulses of fixed
time

Alternatively to extracting @xmath profile from oscillations @xmath for
various values of @xmath and @xmath (Sec. 6.2 and Fig. 6.2 ) @xmath can
be kept fixed while both @xmath and @xmath are sweeped. In the resulting
map (Fig. 6.4 ) lines of constant @xmath indicate lines of constant
@xmath . And so the first minimum (black stripe) will correspond to
@xmath , first maximum (bright stripe): @xmath and so on. Density of
oscillations represents therefore the gradient of @xmath and
susceptibility to charge noise.

In Fig. 6.4 we can see that for large @xmath the density of the
oscillations decreases indicating the symmetry point. Unfortunately, we
couldn’t observed the full symmetry of the pattern [ 68 ] because of
limited voltage range of the waveform generator and high attenuation of
the fast lines.

Fast decay of exchange oscillations requires usage of various times of
exchange time @xmath to probe various regimes of @xmath . Choice of
@xmath ns will correspond to probing @xmath MHz which is comparable to
the gradient of Overhauser field. As a result the measurement becomes
more noisy. 50 ns is also sufficiently long time enable leakage to fully
polarized @xmath state. The crossing between @xmath and @xmath states is
visible as a single dark line in Fig. 6.4 (c).

#### 6.9 Unpublished: Exchange oscillations in symmetric, tilt and
semi-tilt mode at the same frequency

The additional set of exchange oscillations presented here (Fig. 6.5 )
shows how @xmath of exchange oscillations for fixed frequency changes
between charge-noise-dominated (tilt) and nuclear-noise dominated
(symmetric) regime. The top curve shows Gaussian decay for the pure tilt
mode. The middle curve probes intermediate regime. This exchange
rotations involved pulse along both @xmath and @xmath axis. Non-Gaussian
tail indicates reduced influence of a quasistatic charge noise. The
bottom curve was acquired in the pure symmetric mode. The decay
throughout approximately first 50 ns remains unchanged compared to the
first two traces, but the extremely long power-law tail that it is the
Overhauser field fluctuations that limit the fidelity of oscillations.

#### 6.10 Unpublished: Exchange oscillations at sweet spot for various
@xmath

The final dataset (Fig. 6.6 ) presents crossover from nuclei-dominated
decay to charge-noise-dominated decay. At smallest @xmath decay has a
power-law tail, revealing influence of the nuclei. Notably up to @xmath
mV the characteristic decay time remains roughly unchanged. Meanwhile
the frequency of oscillations dramatically increases, indicating
substantial increase of @xmath . For @xmath mV the envelope shortens and
becomes Gaussian. This is a result of dominant role of charge noise. At
this point @xmath is close to the saturation (Fig. 4.4 d).

## Part III Nuclear dynamics and dynamical decoupling

### Chapter 7 Overhauser noise and dynamical decoupling

The noise limiting utility of GaAs spin qubits arises due to hyperfine
interaction between each electronic spin and the nuclear spin bath. In
striking contrast to the electrical noise the nuclear noise has been
researched in depth in just about every system that is a potential
candidate for a spin qubit implementation [ 103 , 95 , 104 , 105 , 106 ]
. These studies covered a wide range of topics including the free
dynamics of the nuclear spin bath, dynamical decoupling of the qubit and
controlling the bath by means of the dynamical nuclear polarization. In
this chapter I will focus on the elementary properties of the GaAs spin
bath dynamics interacting with a single electron and dynamical
decoupling techniques that are most relevant for the novel results
presented in chapters 8 and 9 .

#### 7.1 Hamiltonian governing the dynamics of an electron and nuclei

The dynamics of the coupled electron-nuclear bath system is ruled by
three main mechanisms [ 10 ] – the Zeeman effect, the hyperfine
interaction and dipole-dipole interaction between nuclei.

Typically the largest energies in the system are related to the Zeeman
splitting due to external magnetic field which can be described by the
Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the g-factor of the electron (or the nuclei of species
@xmath ), @xmath is the magnitude of the external magnetic field
(assumed to be pointing along the @xmath direction) while @xmath and
@xmath are the electron and nuclear spin operators. The summation is
performed over the nuclei of several species @xmath ( @xmath Ga, @xmath
Ga and @xmath As in case of GaAs quantum dot). For the purpose of this
chapter we will assume that both the electron and nuclear Zeeman
splitting are much larger than other energy scales.

The hyperfine interaction between the electron and nuclei is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the hyperfine coupling between @xmath -th nuclei and the
electron, which depends on the nuclear species and the amplitude of the
electronic wavefunction at the nuclear site. Due to anisotropy
introduced by the external magnetic field it is convenient to rewrite
this Hamiltonian as two separate terms. The @xmath component gives an
effective magnetic field experienced by the electron due to nuclei and
vice versa. The @xmath terms describe a second-order flip-flop processes
between nuclei, mediated by the electron.

The dipole-dipole interaction between the nuclei can be described by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

which I have already written down in a way that distinguishes between
components parallel and perpendicular to an external magnetic field.

Finally, the quadrupolar coupling between electric field gradients and
nuclear spin also has an influence on the system dynamics [ 107 , 108 ]
, which I will mention in the relevant places of the discussion.

#### 7.2 Electron dephasing in a quasistatic nuclear field

Due to the assumption about the dominant influence of the magnetic field
we can, in the first approximation, neglect the flip-flop processes
between nuclei ¹ ¹ 1 for magnetic field >100 mT and timescales up to a
microsecond this is a very accurate approximation . On the other hand we
observe that even at the typical dilution refrigerator base temperature
of 20 mK ( @xmath @xmath eV) the nuclear bath is in the infinite
temperature limit ( @xmath is of the order of 0.01 @xmath eV at @xmath
T).

Large magnetic field and high temperature motivate treatment of the
nuclear bath as a collection of classical spins with random projection
on the direction of the magnetic field. Since all flip-flop processes
are over each of the nuclear spins induces a small energy shift to the
electron Zeeman splitting @xmath . Since the electron wavefunction
overlaps with tens to millions of the nuclei it is convenient to threat
their collective influence in terms of an effective magnetic field,
called the Overhauser field

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

which points in the direction parallel to the external magnetic field.
Since the flip-flop terms play a role on a longer timescale it is common
to consider the orientation of each spin to be random each time the
electron-spin manipulation experiment is performed. This leads to the
probability distribution of Overhauser field amplitudes which are
characterized by several parameters, and for most purposes can be
considered Gaussian and centered on @xmath .

Firstly, the Overhauser field can be characterized by the value of the
external magnetic field corresponding to the full polarization of the
nuclear spins. Secondly, the crucial parameter is the number of nuclei
of each spinful species within the electronic wavefunction. These two
give a typical (rms) value of the Overhauser field experienced by the
electron and an inhomogeneous dephasing time.

For a GaAs quantum dot the electronic wavefunction overlaps with about a
million [ 7 ] nuclei of @xmath Ga, @xmath Ga and @xmath As. In the case
of full polarization these nuclei would create an affective magnetic
field of between 3 and 6 T [ 109 , 110 ] . The actual rms value of the
Overhauser field is reduced by a factor @xmath compared with the full
polarization, where @xmath is the number of nuclei, resulting in typical
magnetic fields of several millitesla [ 96 , 93 ] . Finally, this
translates into a decoherence time of about [ 7 , 109 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

Such a short coherence time is the ultimate obstacle to scaling of the
GaAs spin qubits, since it puts a severe constraint on the maximum gate
fidelity. Several methods, including stabilization of the spin bath by
means of dynamical nuclear polarization [ 111 , 45 , 112 , 113 , 22 ]
and dynamical decoupling (Sec. 7.5 ) allow relaxing the limitation
arising from the short inhomogeneous dephasing time, but they both incur
significant overhead.

The ultimate solution to this problem is to reduce the fraction of the
spinful nuclei within the electronic wavefunction. Unfortunately this is
impossible for spin qubits in III-V material, such as GaAs, since the
odd number of protons in the atomic nucleus means a non-zero total spin.
For that reason the focus many in the spin qubit community shifts to
semiconductors of group IV, in particular Si and SiGe. In the case of
both, silicon and germanium the spinful isotopes are in a minority – the
natural abundance of @xmath Si is 4.7%, while @xmath Ge is 7.7% [ 114 ]
. It has been demonstrated that usage of natural silicon is sufficient
to extend inhomogenuous dephasing times to more than perform a single
spin manipulation at the quantum error correction threshold [ 115 , 19 ,
18 ] . Further isotopical purification virtually eliminates the spinful
nuclei from the lattice (<1000 ppm) and the related decoherence effects
[ 20 ] .

#### 7.3 Overhauser field fluctuations

The degree to which a certain kind of noise is detrimental for the qubit
coherence depends not only on the variance of fluctuations but also
their rate. In case of the Overhauser field the fluctuation rate is
related to the internuclei interactions leading to flip-flops.

The two relevant processes that have to be considered are the
dipole-dipole interaction (Eq. ( 7.3 )), and flip-flops mediated by
virtual flipping of the electron (a second-order process resulting from
the hyperfine interaction; Eq. ( 7.2 )) [ 109 , 10 ] . The exact rates
for both of these depend on the mismatch between the Zeeman splitting of
the interacting nuclei.

In the first place, different nuclear species are characterized by
different g-factors, and therefore flip-flops between pairs of identical
nuclei are most relevant.

Second, the nuclei experience the Knight field (effective magnetic field
due to interaction with the electron, dual to the Overhauser field),
that varies depending on the wavefunction amplitude at the nuclear site
[ 116 ] . Curiously, large differences of Knight field lead to
suppression of the nuclear flip-flops, but each such event has more
significant impact on the Overhauser field. Conversly, if the two
electrons experience identical Knight fields the flip-flops are not
suppressed, but they have no impact on the Overhauser field. This
interplay makes the degree of flip-flop suppression strongly dependent
on the (unknown) electronic wavefunction shape.

Third, the magnetic field affects the detuning between electronic and
nuclear Zeeman splitting, influencing the rate of the electron-mediated
flip-flops [ 117 , 96 ] .

Finally, the strain-related gradients of electric field couple to the
quadrupole moment of the nuclei [ 118 ] . This is most evident in the
study of the Overhauser field performed in optically active
self-assembled GaAs quantum dots where the diffusion is supressed by
several orders of magnitude relative to gate defined GaAs dots [ 107 ,
106 , 95 , 96 ] .

The resulting rate of Overhauser field fluctuations is sufficiently
small to allow performing thousands of repetitions of the electron spin
manipulation experiment within the nuclear spin bath coherence time
(which is of the order of seconds) [ 82 , 93 , 96 ] . This enables
either measuring the Overhauser fields, and adjusting the spin
manipulating sequence accordingly [ 112 ] or exploiting spin transfer
between electron and nuclei to manipulate the spin bath [ 111 , 45 , 72
, 119 ] . Quantification of the Overhauser field fluctuation timescales
is the topic of chapter 8 .

#### 7.4 Larmor precession of the nuclei

Except for diffusion-like low frequency dynamics, the Overhauser field
has nontrivial high frequency behaviour, related to the Larmor
precession of the nuclei. The amplitude of related fluctuations is very
small and can be revealed only when the electron decoherence due to slow
Overhauser field dynamics is suppressed by means of dynamical
decoupling, which will be the topic of the next section. Nevertheless
the particular power spectrum makes these fluctuations an interesting
topic for experimental and theoretical study.

To understand the Overhauser field dynamics related to the Larmor
precession one needs to include in the considerations the Overhauser
field perpendicular to the external magnetic field. Within this extended
framework the effective magnetic field experienced by the electron has
three contributions: external magnetic field, Overhauser field both
parallel and perpendicular to the external magnetic field (Fig. 7.1 ).
Since we assume that the external magnetic field is much larger than the
other fields we can write the amplitude of the total effective magnetic
field (to the lowest nonvanishing order in @xmath ) as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

This formula shows that a relatively small influence of the transverse
field on the electron coherence is a consequence of the suppression by a
factor of @xmath , which is typically somewhere between 0.2 and 0.01,
depending on the external magnetic field, dot size etc. Nevertheless it
is the transverse Overhauser field that gives raise to the high
frequency nuclear noise.

The curious high frequency dynamics of the Overhauser field can be
understood by treating the transverse field as consisting of several
“partial” fields related to each nuclear species [ 74 , 108 , 94 ] (Fig.
7.1 b). Each of this species Larmor precesses at a different frequency
(megahertz-scale for typical magnetic field of a few hundred militesla),
giving rise to the noise focused at very specific narrow bands. The
quadratic coupling to the qubit splitting implies that these are mostly
the Larmor difference frequencies. In chapter 9 we demonstrate how to
deterministically suppress a noise at these frequencies with dynamical
decoupling. But first it is relevant to introduce the principles of
dynamical decoupling.

#### 7.5 Dynamical decoupling from a low frequency noise

The principle of dynamical decoupling can be most easily understood in
the case of quasistatic noise. When considering a superposition of
@xmath and @xmath , the two eigenstates will be acquiring a predictable
phase due to magnetic-field-induced Zeeman splitting and a random phase
due to the Overhauser field @xmath . Let’s consider the Overhauser field
fixed on the timescale we are interested in. Swapping @xmath and @xmath
states with a @xmath -pulse after certain time @xmath (Fig. 7.2 )
results in the random phase being perfectly cancelled out after another
time @xmath . And so the coherence will be restored after the total time
@xmath . This technique, called spin echo or Hahn echo [ 120 ] was first
demonstrated in nuclear magnetic resonance. The decay time of the echo
signal is a simple measure of the non-quasistatic noise and is one of
the measures of the qubit performance [ 121 ] .

An echoing technique can be extended to minimize the effect of the slow
fluctuations in the qubit splitting by implementing a train of evenly
spaced @xmath -pulses, called Carr-Purcell (CP) sequence [ 122 ] . As
illustrated in Fig. 7.3 a the phase acquired between @xmath th and
@xmath th @xmath -pulse will almost perfectly cancel the phase acquired
between @xmath th and @xmath th @xmath -pulse. Effectively, the CP
sequence will suppress any components of the noise fluctuation that do
not change on the @xmath timescale.

#### 7.6 Dynamical decoupling as a filter design

The difference between Hahn echo and CP sequences in the efficiency of
decoupling from low frequency noise can be demonstrated in the frequency
domain. For that purpose one represents the environmental noise as a
power spectrum ² ² 2 Throughout this chapter we assume the noise to be
Gaussian. This assumption implies that the noise is fully quantified by
its power spectrum. , @xmath , and assigns a filter function, @xmath ,
to the sequence of @xmath -pulses [ 99 , 100 ] . The filter function for
a sequence of @xmath -pulses is given by

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (7.7)
     @xmath   @xmath      (7.8)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the angular frequency, @xmath indicates a Fourier
transform, @xmath represents the decoupling sequence, @xmath is the
Heaviside step function and @xmath is the time at which the @xmath th
@xmath -pulse is applied (in particular @xmath and @xmath are the
beginning and the end of the sequence). The function @xmath has a value
of @xmath and changes sign at the moment of @xmath -pulse application,
and is 0 beyond the duration in the sequence (Fig. 7.3 b). In most of
the studies of dynamical decoupling the sequences are defined by
specifying the fractions of the total sequence duration @xmath at which
@xmath -pulses are applied. For example for Hahn echo @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath .

With these one can quantify coherence at the end of the pulse sequence
by calculating

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (7.9)
     @xmath   @xmath      (7.10)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

A formulation of the dynamical decoupling has led to tremendous amount
of work oriented at suppression of the low frequency noise [ 123 , 124 ,
125 ] . These works usually aim at setting the @xmath along with one or
several derivatives, or at minimization of @xmath given certain noise
spectrum @xmath .

The suppression of the now frequency noise achieved with dynamical
decoupling sequences is sufficient for the high frequency noise related
to the Larmor precession of the nuclei (Sec. 7.4 ) to leave a
fingerprint on the decoherence pattern [ 94 , 74 , 108 , 105 ] . To gain
additional insight into high-frequency noise one can focus on the filter
function shape at frequencies comparable to the typical spacing between
the @xmath -pulses in a sequence. It is at these frequencies that the
filter functions exhibit a pattern of minima and maxima. The minima can
be used either to address a narrow-band high-frequency noise [ 101 , 94
] while the maxima enhance a specific band enabling the noise
spectroscopy [ 12 , 126 , 127 , 128 , 129 , 97 , 130 ] .

[width=0.8breakable, size=minimal, colback=white] Using a
singlet-triplet spin qubit as a sensitive spectrometer of the GaAs
nuclear spin bath, we demonstrate that the spectrum of Overhauser noise
agrees with a classical spin diffusion model over six orders of
magnitude in frequency, from 1 mHz to 1 kHz, is flat below 10 mHz, and
falls as @xmath for frequency @xmath Hz. Increasing the applied magnetic
field from 0.1 T to 0.75 T suppresses electron-mediated spin diffusion,
which decreases spectral content in the @xmath region and lowers the
saturation frequency, each by an order of magnitude, consistent with a
numerical model. Spectral content at megahertz frequencies is accessed
using dynamical decoupling, which shows a crossover from the few-pulse
regime ( @xmath -pulses), where transverse Overhauser fluctuations
dominate dephasing, to the many-pulse regime ( @xmath @xmath -pulses),
where longitudinal Overhauser fluctuations with a @xmath spectrum
dominate.

#### 8.1 Introduction

Precise control of single electron spins in gate-defined quantum dots
makes them a promising platform for quantum computation [ 5 , 21 , 7 ,
87 , 37 ] . In particular, GaAs spin qubits benefit from unmatched
reliability in fabrication and tuning. However, being a III-V
semiconductor, the GaAs lattice hosts spinful nuclei that couple to
electron spins via the hyperfine interaction [ 7 , 37 , 94 , 74 , 45 ] .
Nuclear dynamics lead to fluctuations of the Overhauser field, which
affect the coherent evolution of spin qubits. In turn, advances in qubit
operation, including single-shot readout [ 82 ] and long dynamical
decoupling sequences [ 94 ] , allow spin qubits to serve as sensitive
probes of the electron-plus-nuclear-environment system, an interesting
coupled nonlinear many-body system.

#### 8.2 Measuring Overhauser field gradient with @xmath-@xmath qubit

In this Letter, we use a singlet-triplet (S-T @xmath ) qubit as a probe
to reveal the dynamics and magnetic field dependence of the GaAs nuclear
spin bath over a wide range of frequencies, without the use of nuclear
pumping [ 112 , 131 , 119 ] or postselection [ 93 ] techniques. The
qubit is defined in a two-electron double quantum dot (Fig. 8.1 a). The
external magnetic field @xmath separates the qubit states singlet,
@xmath , and the unpolarized triplet, @xmath , from the fully polarized
triplet states, @xmath and @xmath . In this notation, the first (second)
arrow indicates the spin in the left (right) dot. The resulting energy
diagram of the spin states at the transition between (1,1) and (2,0)
charge states is presented in Fig. 8.1 b. Here ( @xmath , @xmath )
indicates the number of electrons in the left ( @xmath ) and the right (
@xmath ) dot. The Bloch sphere representation of the qubit is shown in
Fig. 8.1 c.

Dynamics of the S-T @xmath qubit in the well-separated (1,1) charge
state, i.e., for vanishing exchange, @xmath , between the two electrons,
is governed by the static external magnetic field @xmath and dynamic
Overhauser fields. For large @xmath , we can model the qubit evolution
using the Hamiltonian [ 94 , 74 , 132 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the electronic @xmath -factor, @xmath is a Bohr
magneton, @xmath is the spin operator of the electron in left or right
dot @xmath , and @xmath is the Overhauser field component parallel to
@xmath . The influence of the transverse Overhauser field component
@xmath on the qubit is strongly suppressed when @xmath is much larger
than the typical Overhauser field. Hence the transverse Overhauser field
fluctuations play a significant role in the qubit evolution only when
the influence of the fluctuating longitudinal Overhauser field @xmath is
eliminated by dynamical decoupling [ 74 , 94 ] . The splitting between
qubit states @xmath and @xmath for @xmath is thus proportional to the
longitudinal component of the Overhauser field gradient, @xmath , and
can be measured by monitoring the qubit precession between @xmath and
@xmath [ 45 , 82 , 75 ] .

To measure this precession, we apply a cyclic pulse sequence that first
prepares the singlet, then separates the two electrons to allow free
precession in the Overhauser field for time @xmath , and finally
performs a projective readout of the qubit in the S-T @xmath basis (Fig.
8.1 d). The total length of the pulse sequence is approximately 30
@xmath s, including 10 @xmath s of readout time. For each @xmath we use
16 single-shot readouts of this sequence to estimate the singlet return
probability, @xmath . By repeatedly sweeping @xmath from 0 to 250 ns in
300 steps allows the precession of the qubit in the evolving Overhauser
field to be measured with roughly 1 s temporal resolution (slow mode). A
time trace showing 80 s of slow-mode probability data is shown in Fig.
8.2 a. To increase the temporal resolution from 1 s to 12 ms we omit the
probability estimation and record one single-shot outcome for each
@xmath (fast mode). A time trace showing 1 s of fast-mode single-shot
data is shown in Fig. 8.2 b. The time evolution of the qubit precession
frequency, @xmath , is then extracted from these data as described in
Sec. 10.1 . The frequency corresponds to the absolute value of the
Overhauser field gradient @xmath . Examples of @xmath for @xmath T are
shown in Figs. 8.2 a,b. In contrast to experiments performing dynamic
nuclear polarization [ 133 , 72 , 134 ] the observed distributions of
@xmath reveal no sign of multistable behaviour (see Sec. 10.2 ).

#### 8.3 @xmath low frequency dynamics

Next, we focus on the power spectral density (PSD) of @xmath for @xmath
T. Since taking the absolute value of @xmath introduces kinks in @xmath
traces, adding spurious high-frequency content, we instead extract the
PSD of @xmath (Fig. 8.2 c). The resulting spectrum is flat below @xmath
Hz and falls off as @xmath above 1 Hz, indicating a correlation time of
@xmath of a few seconds.

A classical model of Overhauser field fluctuations due to nuclear spin
diffusion is used to fit the experimental data in Fig. 8.2 c [ 95 ]
(Sec. 10.5 ). In the model we use the double dot geometry estimated from
the lithographic dimensions of the device and the heterostructure growth
parameters (distance between the dots @xmath nm, dot diameter @xmath nm
and width of the electron wave function in the crystal growth direction
@xmath nm). We fit the effective diffusion constant @xmath nm @xmath /s
and the equilibrium width of the @xmath distribution @xmath mT. This
model yields the power spectrum of @xmath , which has the same
qualitative behavior as the spectrum of @xmath – it is flat at low
frequencies ( @xmath Hz) and falls off as @xmath at high frequencies (
@xmath Hz). Such a relation between the PSD of a Gaussian distributed
variable and that of its square is expected whenever the PSD has a
@xmath dependence over a wide frequency range [ 98 ] .

In order to extend the spectral range to higher frequencies we apply the
pulse cycle with a fixed separation time @xmath ns, acquiring a
single-shot measurement every 30 @xmath s. This can be visualized as a
horizontal cut through the data in Fig. 8.2 b (top) at 100 ns, though,
of course, now without taking the rest of the data at other values of
@xmath . Although the series of single-shot outcomes at fixed @xmath
does not allow a direct measure of @xmath from temporal oscillations, it
does give statistical spectral information [ 95 ] . In particular, the
Fourier transform of the windowed autocorrelation of single-shot
outcomes (Sec. 10.3 ) yields a PSD of the singlet return probability
@xmath , now extended to 4 kHz.

Power spectra of @xmath for the lowest and highest applied fields
studied, @xmath and 0.75 T are shown in Fig. 8.3 . We observe that the
spectrum for @xmath T is reduced by an order of magnitude in the @xmath
regime, compared to the spectrum at @xmath T. To quantify the observed
magnetic field dependence of the PSD of @xmath we fit the nuclear spin
diffusion constant @xmath of the classical diffusion model (Sec. 10.5 )
to data, using fixed @xmath mT (obtained from the fit in Fig. 8.2 ) and
the same geometrical parameters as above. The observed agreement with
experimental data suggests that the effects of the nuclear spin bath are
well described by classical evolution up to at least 1 kHz.

At low @xmath we observe a strong enhancement of the effective spin
diffusion constant compared to the literature value for bulk GaAs in the
absence of free electrons, @xmath @xmath [ 135 ] (Fig. 8.3 , inset).
Qualitatively, this increase may be attributed to electron-mediated
nuclear flip-flop processes [ 136 , 137 , 117 , 95 , 138 ] , which
dominate over nuclear dipole-dipole mediated diffusion. At 0.75 T the
effective diffusion constant drops down to the value for bulk GaAs.
Despite this agreement, we note that our values for @xmath are not
corrected for possible changes of electronic wavefunctions with
increasing magnetic field. A quantitative statement about the underlying
bare diffusion constant is difficult, as the fitting results for D are
sensitive to assumptions about the spatial extent of the quantum dots
(in particular @xmath ) and the fraction of time spent in (1,1) and
(2,0). Since spin diffusion due to nuclear dipole-dipole interaction is
strongly suppressed by the Knight field gradient [ 139 ] and quadrupolar
splittings, we expect further suppression of @xmath at higher magnetic
fields [ 117 ] , and saturation below the bulk GaAs value. Indeed, this
is observed in self-assembled quantum dots, where quadrupolar splittings
are significantly stronger due to strain [ 140 , 137 , 107 ] .

#### 8.4 High frequency dynamics of the Overhauser field

Overhauser field fluctuations above 100 kHz are too fast to be observed
as oscillation between @xmath and @xmath with the present setup.
However, we can infer spectral features from the decoherence of @xmath
and @xmath states using Hahn echo and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG)
dynamical decoupling sequences [ 141 , 94 ] . Since these decoupling
sequences act as filters in frequency domain, we can relate the
Overhauser spectrum to the decay of qubit coherence [ 94 , 99 , 100 ,
142 ] . In particular, Hahn echo and CPMG sequences suppress the low
frequency fluctuations, making the coherence decay a sensitive probe of
high-frequency Overhauser fields.

The decoupling sequence in Fig. 8.4 a uses symmetric exchange pulses [
64 ] , but is otherwise standard [ 141 ] : initialize in S(2,0), evolve
for time @xmath in (1,1), apply symmetric exchange @xmath -pulse, evolve
for another @xmath , repeat the @xmath segment a total of @xmath times.
After the total evolution time @xmath , project onto S-T @xmath by
pulsing to (2,0) and perform single-shot readout. Averaging @xmath 1000
such single-shot readouts then yields the singlet return probability.
For such a sequence the resulting singlet return probability is related
to the qubit coherence by @xmath , where @xmath is the normalized
coherence of the spin in dot @xmath at time @xmath .

Figure 8.4 b shows the singlet return probability for Hahn echo and CPMG
sequences with various numbers of @xmath pulses, @xmath , as a function
of the interpulse time @xmath . For sequences with small @xmath ,
coherence decreases smoothly with @xmath , while for sequences with
large @xmath the decay is strongly modulated. It was previously shown [
74 , 94 ] that the coherence modulations are due to narrowband spectral
content at megahertz frequencies in the transverse Overhauser field
@xmath , arising from the relative Larmor precession of the three
nuclear species.

The influence of transverse Overhauser fluctuations, @xmath , on the
CPMG signal decay was simulated using a semiclassical theory [ 143 , 10
, 132 ] that previously gave good agreement with echo [ 72 , 108 ] and
CPMG [ 94 ] experiments (see Sec. 10.6 for details). Comparisons of
experimental data with numerical simulations are shown in Fig. 8.4 b.
First, we include only narrowband transverse fields (gray curves),
assuming two identical dots each containing @xmath nuclei and a spread
of effective fields experienced by the nuclei of @xmath mT, arising, for
example, from quadrupolar splittings [ 74 , 106 , 108 , 106 ] . This
simulation reproduces the coherence decay for Hahn echo and the
coherence modulations. The decay envelopes for the simulated CPMG,
however, do not agree well with experiment, especially for large @xmath
. In order to gain additional insight into the source of decoherence we
extract the envelope decay time, @xmath , from the experimental data and
plot it as a function of @xmath (Fig. 8.4 c and Fig. 10.4 ) [ 141 ] . We
observe an initial scaling of @xmath with @xmath , and a crossover to
@xmath for large @xmath .

We ascribe the change in the observed @xmath scaling to a crossover
between decoherence limited by transverse to longitudinal Overhauser
field dynamics. For small @xmath the fluctuations of @xmath dominate the
decoherence, leading to scaling with large @xmath ; purely transverse
low-frequency fluctuations are expected to yield @xmath with @xmath (see
Sec. 10.6 ). With increasing @xmath other decoherence sources start
playing a dominant role. The intermediate-frequency fluctuations of
@xmath cause additional superexponential decay, which for large @xmath
is given by @xmath , where @xmath is the PSD of @xmath [ 127 , 128 , 126
] . Assuming that this PSD has a @xmath power-law behavior in the
relevant frequency range, the CPMG decay for fixed @xmath and varying
@xmath is then @xmath , with @xmath and @xmath [ 141 ] . The observed
scaling with @xmath is therefore consistent with @xmath noise and a
Gaussian decay.

As shown in Fig. 8.4 b (black lines), adding the @xmath envelope
function, @xmath and @xmath @xmath s, appropriate for @xmath , gives
good agreement with experimental results. From the agreement between the
simulations and the measurements we estimate that for @xmath kHz the PSD
@xmath with @xmath @xmath s. For comparison with results presented in
Ref. [ 94 ] we extrapolate this frequency dependence to @xmath kHz.
Using the extrapolated value we estimate the CPMG decay time in an
experiment in which @xmath is fixed but @xmath is varied, @xmath . Such
estimate yields @xmath ms for @xmath ns, which is close to @xmath ms
measured in Ref. [ 94 ] .

The @xmath power law found for @xmath kHz differs from the @xmath
spectrum observed below 1 kHz. This is not surprising, since for
frequencies higher than the strength of intra-nuclear interactions (
@xmath 1 kHz) the diffusion model is no longer applicable. Whether the
high-frequency @xmath fluctuations have the same physical origin
(i.e. flip-flops of nuclei due to dipolar and hyperfine-mediated
interactions) as the low-frequency ones is an open question.

Theory for CPMG decay caused by spectral diffusion due to dipolar
interactions predicts a coherence decay of the form @xmath , with @xmath
for small and even @xmath [ 144 ] . This decay form (and scaling) is in
disagreement with our observations. In particular for large @xmath ,
existing spectral diffusion theories based on cluster expansion [ 116 ,
145 , 146 ] may need to be refined, for example taking into account
realistic shapes of the electronic wave functions. Based on our
findings, such theories can be tested experimentally at @xmath T, where
bare dipole-dipole coupling is the dominant internuclear interaction.

Finally, it is possible that the @xmath fluctuations are not of
intrinsic origin (nuclear dynamics), but of extrinsic origin. For
example, charge noise, which generically has a @xmath spectrum with
@xmath [ 12 ] , can shift the electron wavefunction and effectively
result in Overhauser field fluctuations [ 132 ] .

#### 8.5 Conclusion

In conclusion, we have experimentally investigated the spectrum of the
GaAs nuclear environment for spin qubits and find it consistent with
classical diffusion over six orders of magnitude in frequency, from
millihertz to kilohertz. For applied fields below @xmath T, nuclear
diffusion is dominated by the electron-mediated flip-flop, enhancing
diffusion by a factor of 8. Decoherence of the S-T @xmath qubit is
dominated by fluctuations of the transverse Overhauser field for short
CPMG sequences, and by longitudinal Overhauser field for CPMG sequences
with more than 32 @xmath pulses.

#### 9.1 Introduction

Electron spins in gate-defined quantum dots provide a promising platform
for quantum computation [ 5 , 21 , 87 , 74 , 7 , 42 , 14 ] . In
particular, spin-based quantum computing in gallium arsenide takes
advantage of the high quality of semiconducting materials, reliability
in fabricating arrays of quantum dots, and accurate qubit operations [
42 , 7 , 45 , 12 , 14 , 64 ] . However, the effective magnetic noise
arising from the hyperfine interaction with uncontrolled nuclear spins
in the host lattice constitutes a major source of decoherence [ 7 , 74 ,
108 , 64 ] . Low frequency nuclear noise, responsible for fast (10 ns)
inhomogeneous dephasing [ 7 ] , can be removed by echo techniques [ 7 ,
74 , 147 , 83 , 141 , 108 ] . High frequency nuclear noise, recently
studied via echo revivals [ 74 , 108 ] , occurs in narrow frequency
bands related to differences in Larmor precession of the three isotopes
@xmath Ga, @xmath Ga, and @xmath As [ 143 , 10 , 132 ] . Here we show
that both low and high frequency nuclear noise can be filtered by
appropriate dynamical decoupling sequences, resulting in a substantial
enhancement of spin qubit coherence times. Using nuclear notch
filtering, we demonstrate a spin coherence time ( @xmath ) of 0.87 ms,
five orders of magnitude longer than typical exchange gate times, and
exceeding the longest coherence times reported to date in Si/SiGe
gate-defined quantum dots [ 51 , 18 ] .

#### 9.2 Qubit and nuclear spin bath

The qubit under study is implemented in a gate-defined double dot, with
a potential that can be manipulated via nanosecond voltage pulses
applied to gate electrodes @xmath , @xmath and @xmath (Fig. 9.1 a and
Methods). The qubit states are encoded in the two-electron spin singlet
state, @xmath , and the spin triplet state, @xmath , where the arrows
indicate the spin projections of the electrons in the left and right
dots [ 7 , 45 ] . These qubit states are energetically separated from
the spin-polarized two-electron states, @xmath and @xmath , by an
external magnetic field @xmath , ranging from 0.2 to 1 tesla in this
experiment. Single-shot readout of the qubit is accomplished using
spin-to-charge conversion followed by readout of a proximal sensor dot [
82 , 83 ] (see Methods).

As illustrated in Fig. 9.1 b,d, the local Zeeman energy in dot @xmath is
perturbed by the Overhauser field @xmath arising from the hyperfine
interaction with the nuclear spin bath. In our device, each electron is
in contact with @xmath nuclear spins, comprised of three species: @xmath
Ga, @xmath Ga, and @xmath As [ 7 , 74 , 132 ] .

The Bloch sphere of the @xmath - @xmath qubit is shown in Fig. 9.1 c.
Bold arrows indicate the rotation axes associated with the exchange
interaction, @xmath , and the gradient of the effective field between
the dots, @xmath , where @xmath is the magnitude of the total effective
field in dot @xmath [ 45 ] . Note that transverse nuclear field
gradients tilt the quantization axes in the two dots relative to each
other. For large external fields this primarily leads to a minor
redefinition of the qubit subspace [ 132 ] ; for simplicity throughout
this work we refer to the states in the qubit subspace by the
conventional labels @xmath and @xmath .

Overhauser field fluctuations in each dot are non-Markovian, with low
frequency (power-law) spectral content parallel to the external field,
denoted @xmath (suppressing the dot index), and narrow-band spectral
components at the nuclear Larmor frequency scale perpendicular to the
external field, denoted @xmath . Low frequency fluctuations arise
primarily from nuclear spin diffusion [ 95 ] , driven by dipole-dipole
interactions between neighboring nuclei, and nonlocal electron-mediated
flip-flops [ 148 , 145 , 143 , 10 ] . High frequency fluctuations of
@xmath arise primarily due to the megahertz-scale relative Larmor
precession of different nuclear spins [ 74 , 132 , 108 ] . The
transverse Overhauser field @xmath is given by the sum of contributions
@xmath , @xmath , and @xmath of the three isotopic species, each of
which precesses at its own Larmor frequency, see Fig. 9.1 e. This leads
to modulations of the total field in each dot, @xmath , which are
concentrated near the differences of the nuclear Larmor frequencies, and
contribute quadratically to the qubit splitting.

#### 9.3 Dynamical decoupling and notch filtering

To decouple the qubit from the multiscale nuclear noise, we employ the
Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse sequence shown in Fig. 2a. We
first initialize the double dot in a spin singlet by temporarily loading
two electrons into the left dot. Then we quickly separate the electrons
in the double-well potential, thereby rapidly turning off the exchange
interaction, @xmath . In this configuration, the gradient of the total
effective field, @xmath , causes uncontrolled qubit rotation around the
horizontal axis of the Bloch sphere in Fig. 9.1 c. After a time @xmath ,
an exchange pulse is applied by temporarily lowering the barrier between
dots with a voltage pulse on gate @xmath [ 64 ] , implementing a @xmath
rotation around the vertical axis of the Bloch sphere (see Section 11.1
). We repeat this set of operations @xmath times (where @xmath is even)
and, after a total evolution time @xmath , read out the state of the
qubit. The fraction of singlet outcomes is denoted @xmath . Setting
@xmath implements a Hahn-echo sequence, and allows comparison to
previous work [ 74 , 26 , 108 ] .

For quasistatic nuclear noise, the effective field acting on the qubit
before and after the @xmath pulse is nearly the same, causing the qubit
state to be refocused to the singlet after an interval @xmath . For
nuclear noise with power spectrum @xmath , Hahn and CPMG sequences act
as a filter of the noise in the frequency domain [ 99 , 100 , 142 , 101
, 149 , 127 ] . For Gaussian noise, decoherence is described by a
function

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

corresponding to a singlet probability @xmath . In this expression,
@xmath is a filter function that depends on the particular pulse
sequence.

Filter functions for Hahn echo ( @xmath ) and several CPMG sequences (
@xmath ) for fixed @xmath are plotted in Fig. 9.2 b (gray) for varying
numbers of @xmath pulses. We write the CPMG filter function as a product
@xmath , where @xmath is the filter function corresponding to the free
induction decay and @xmath is a slowly varying envelope (see Methods).
@xmath is periodic with period @xmath , with minima occurring at zero
frequency and multiples of @xmath (Fig. 9.2 (b), black), independent of
@xmath . Specific features of the filter functions can be exploited to
decouple the qubit from its characterisitic noise environment. First,
for fixed separation time @xmath , the filter minimum near zero
frequency becomes wider for increasing @xmath (i.e., decreasing @xmath ,
note that the horizontal axis in Fig. 9.2 b is normalized frequency
@xmath ). Thus for fixed @xmath , decoupling from low frequency @xmath
-type noise ( @xmath ) becomes more efficient as @xmath increases.
Second, the minima that occur at multiples of @xmath indicate that noise
at these frequencies is notch-filtered, in the sense that specific
narrow frequency windows are suppressed.

A schematic of the spectral density of nuclear noise for the @xmath -
@xmath qubit fabricated in a GaAs heterostructure is shown in Fig. 9.2
c, distinguishing longitudinal low frequency noise (green) and
transverse narrow-band noise (red). The low frequency longitudinal
contribution is well described by a power-law spectrum [ 95 , 141 ] ,
and can be removed efficiently by any CPMG sequence (Fig. 9.2 d). The
high frequency transverse contribution due to relative Larmor precession
of nuclei is concentrated near the three Larmor frequency differences [
10 ] , at megahertz frequencies for tesla-scale applied fields.
Remarkably, two of the Larmor difference frequencies, @xmath and @xmath
, are nearly equal, independent of magnetic field, and hence the third
frequency difference, @xmath , occurs at twice that frequency. This
coincidental property of the three nuclear species allows us to
approximately align minima of the filter function with all three
frequency differences by correctly choosing the time between @xmath
pulses, @xmath , thereby decoupling the qubit from low and high
frequency nuclear noise simultaneously.

#### 9.4 Revivals of coherence

We now demonstrate the efficacy of this notch filter strategy in our
experimental setup. The narrow-band character of the high frequency
nuclear noise is revealed by plotting the observed singlet return
probability @xmath as a function of @xmath -pulse separation time @xmath
(rather than total separation time @xmath ). Independent of the choice
of @xmath , we observe an initial loss of coherence followed by revivals
at @xmath 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, … @xmath s (Fig. 9.3 a). These values of @xmath
correspond to decoupling conditions shown in Fig. 9.3 b, namely the
alignment of nuclear difference frequencies (shaded red) with minima of
the filter function envelope. Qualitatively, the alternating depth of
filter minima in Fig. 9.3 b also explains the alternating heights of
revivals, most pronounced for @xmath in Fig. 9.3 a. With increasing
@xmath , the height of the revivals decreases. This is related to
decoherence arising from low frequency noise (shaded green in Fig. 9.3
b) [ 141 ] . Revivals observed for Hahn-echo sequences can be explained
similarly, except that the filter function for @xmath 1.1 @xmath s has a
maximum near 0.9 MHz (Fig. 9.3 c), rather than a minimum. Accordingly,
@xmath shows a minimum near @xmath @xmath instead of a revival (cf.
@xmath data in Fig. 9.3 a).

The dependence of the decoupling condition for @xmath on nuclear Larmor
dynamics can be verified by changing the applied magnetic field. In Fig.
9.4 a we fix @xmath and measure the decay of coherence as a function of
@xmath . As expected for a linear nuclear Zeeman splitting we find that
the positions of the revival peaks follow a @xmath dependence. We
further observe that the peaks in @xmath disappear at low magnetic
fields. This may arise from several effects. First, the transverse
Overhauser field in each dot, @xmath , affects the total electronic
Zeeman energy more strongly at low magnetic field (see Fig. 9.1 d),
thereby accelerating dephasing. Second, the energy mismatch between
nuclear and electron Zeeman splittings becomes smaller at low fields,
increasing electron-mediated interactions between nuclear spins and the
associated low frequency noise [ 145 , 139 , 10 ] . Third, an increase
in @xmath , as needed to maintain the decoupling condition at lower
fields, narrows the filter function minima and thus reduces decoupling
from high frequency noise.

#### 9.5 Extending coherence time

Next we show that revivals in @xmath translate to prolonged qubit
coherence times, by increasing @xmath while keeping @xmath and @xmath
fixed. This method, pioneered in NMR [ 122 ] , differs from other spin
qubit experiments in which @xmath is held constant while @xmath is swept
proportionally to @xmath [ 74 , 141 ] . Figure 9.4 b plots decay curves
@xmath obtained for @xmath and @xmath @xmath s at @xmath mT (the
corresponding points are indicated in Fig. 9.4 a). For large @xmath and
Gaussian noise, an exponential decay of coherence is expected,
independent of the power spectrum of the noise [ 127 ] . By fitting
exponential decay curves [ 122 , 127 ] (see Methods) we extract
drastically different coherence times @xmath , as indicated. Values of
@xmath for more choices of @xmath are plotted in Fig. 9.4 c, along with
@xmath extracted from Fig. 9.4 a. We observe a clear correlation between
@xmath and @xmath , indicating that qubit coherence is significantly
prolonged whenever the decoupling condition is fulfilled. The
exponential decay indicates that coherence is limited by either
incompletely filtered longitudinal noise or pulse errors.

Finally we comment on the limits of preserving qubit coherence. Most of
the observed features in Fig. 9.4 a are captured by a generalization of
the semiclassical model of Ref. [ 132 ] , modified to include the
details of the CPMG pulse sequence. The model involves four
device-specific parameters (Fig. 9.4 inset): the effective number of
nuclei interacting with each electron, @xmath , a phenomenological
broadening, @xmath mT, of the effective magnetic field acting on nuclei
(likely due to quadrupolar splitting arising from electric field
gradients [ 74 , 132 , 108 ] ), the spectral diffusion time, @xmath
@xmath s, and the exponent associated with the linear low frequency
noise, @xmath (all determined by independent measurements as described
in Sections 11.3 and 11.4 ). The model suggests that the longest
coherence time may be achieved by choosing a decoupling condition
corresponding to the second revival at high magnetic fields, consistent
with a reduced contribution of @xmath to @xmath in each dot (see Fig.
9.1 d) and the decoupling condition depicted in Fig. 9.2 d. We note that
the model does not take pulse errors into account and does not show
several fine features observed in experiment (see white arrows in Fig.
9.4 a, see Section 11.5 ).

By exploring the parameter space between @xmath and @xmath mT with
@xmath corresponding to the first revival peak, we observe coherence
times around 0.7 ms for @xmath to 600 mT, with the largest being @xmath
ms (Fig. 9.5 ), measured at @xmath mT and @xmath @xmath s. However, the
number of examined values of @xmath and @xmath remains insufficient to
resolve the fine structure apparent in the first revival peak.

We expect further improvements by using shorter @xmath pulses and
nuclear programming [ 45 ] . This will improve the fidelity of @xmath
pulses and suppress low frequency noise, allowing the advantageous use
of the decoupling condition in Fig. 9.2 d at high magnetic fields and
high pulse rates.

#### 9.6 Summary

In summary, dynamical decoupling sequences were demonstrated to provide
decoupling from narrow-band high frequency noise, acting as a notch
filter for the nuclear environment. This technique was used to
efficiently decouple a GaAs-based @xmath - @xmath qubit from its nuclear
environment. By synchronizing the repetition rate of @xmath pulses in
CPMG sequences with differences of nuclear Larmor frequencies, the
coherence of a @xmath - @xmath qubit coupled to nuclear spin bath was
extended the millisecond regime (0.87 ms), five orders of magnitude
longer than the gate operation time.

#### 9.7 Methods

##### 9.7.1 The sample

The sample, identical to the one shown in Fig. 1a, is fabricated from a
GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well grown by molecular beam epitaxy.
Crystallographic axes are shown in Fig. 1a. A high-mobility 2D electron
gas (2DEG) is formed 57 nm below the sample surface with carrier density
@xmath = @xmath m @xmath and mobility @xmath = 230 m @xmath /Vs.
Metallic gates, separated from the heterostructure by a 10 nm layer of
HfO @xmath , are used to confine two electrons in the region indicated
by a rectangle in Fig. 1a. Gates indicated in blue and red are operated
at negative voltages to deplete the 2DEG underneath, while gates colored
in green are biased with positive voltages to accumulate electrons
beneath. The charge state and tunnel coupling of the double dot can be
controlled on a nanosecond timescale by applying voltage pulses to gates
@xmath , @xmath , and @xmath .

##### 9.7.2 Initialization and readout of the qubit

The sample is measured at a base temperature of 25 mK in a cryofree
dilution refrigerator, with an external magnetic field @xmath applied
parallel to the @xmath direction indicated in Fig. 1a. The qubit is
initialized in a singlet state by tilting its charge state into the
(2,0) charge configuration and allowing the exchange of electrons with
the left lead near the (1,0) charge transition [ 7 ] .

After qubit manipulation the state of the qubit is measured by tilting
the double well potential to favour the (2,0) charge state. If the two
electrons are in the spin triplet configuration, Pauli blockade prevents
reaching the (2,0) state, and the charge configuration remains (1,1).
The charge state of the double dot modifies the conductance through a
proximity sensor dot operated as a single electron transistor. This
sensor dot is embedded in a radio-frequency resonant circuit, enabling
us to distinguish singlet and triplet states in 8 @xmath s with a
readout visibility of approximately 80%, as defined in Ref. [ 83 ] .

##### 9.7.3 Envelope of a filter function for CPMG sequence

Filter functions for Hahn echo and CPMG sequence (for even number of
@xmath pulses, @xmath ) are given by [ 100 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

To emphasize the qualitative difference between CPMG sequences and the
Hahn echo sequence, and represent features of CPMG filter functions
relevant for large number of @xmath pulses, @xmath , we rewrite

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

using @xmath -independent filter function envelope

  -- -- -- -------
           (9.5)
  -- -- -- -------

obtained by dividing @xmath by the filter function corresponding to free
induction decay

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here @xmath corresponds to a free induction decay time equal to the
total duration as a CPMG sequence. This normalization removes a fine
comb related to the total length of the sequence.

##### 9.7.4 Exponential fits to @xmath

In contrast to many spin qubit experiments [ 74 , 7 , 12 , 108 , 83 ,
141 , 143 , 10 , 18 , 148 , 145 , 26 ] we measure coherence not by
keeping @xmath constant and sweeping @xmath , but by increasing @xmath
while keeping @xmath constant. This method, which is standard in NMR
experiments [ 122 ] , results in an exponential decay of coherence for
large number of @xmath pulses @xmath and long evolution times @xmath ,
independent of the power spectrum of the Gaussian noise [ 127 ] . The
rate of such a decay is determined by the noise spectrum at a frequency
corresponding to the first peak of the filter function from Fig. 9.2 d
at @xmath .

Therefore, we perform an exponential fit of the form @xmath to the data,
where @xmath and @xmath account for preparation and readout fidelity as
well as rapid initial decay of the signal [ 74 , 108 ] , and @xmath is a
coherence time of the qubit. Typical values of @xmath and @xmath
obtained from fits used to extract values of @xmath , shown in Fig. 9.4
c, are @xmath and @xmath . Fit to the data presented in Fig. 5 yields
@xmath and @xmath .

### Chapter 10 Supplementary information for “Spectrum of the nuclear
environment for GaAs spin qubits” {tcolorbox}

[width=0.8breakable, size=minimal, colback=white] This supplementary
information discusses the following topics:

1.   Extracting the frequency of oscillations in Overhauser field from
    averaged and single-shot data

2.   Gaussian distribution of @xmath

3.   Obtaining power spectral density of @xmath from truncated
    autocorrelation of single-shot measurements

    noise

#### 10.1 Extracting the frequency of oscillations in Overhauser field
from averaged and single-shot data

The power spectral density of the gradient of Overhauser field squared
@xmath is obtained from two kinds of data sets.

The first one consists of oscillations in the singlet probability @xmath
as a function of electron separation time @xmath , varying from 0 to
250 ns, measured with 1 s repetition rate. For each studied value of
magnetic field, we measure a 1.5 hour-long data set, and a fragment of
such a data set is presented in Fig. 10.1 a. The frequencies of the
oscillations are obtained by means of Fourier analysis. We calculate the
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of each vertical column and inspect its
absolute value (Fig. 10.1 b). The position of the maximum indicates the
frequency of oscillations, which is related to the gradient of the
Overhauser field between the dots by @xmath (Fig. 10.1 c).

The second data set consists of ten non-averaged measurements, each 30 s
long. A 1 s excerpt of one of them is shown in Fig. 10.1 d. Extracting
the underlying oscillation frequency from each column requires more
careful treatment, since the probabilistic nature of binary measurements
adds large amounts of shot noise. In our analysis we first assign S and
T @xmath outcomes to, respectively, @xmath and @xmath . Then we subtract
from each column its mean, and calculate the autocorrelation (Fig. 10.1
e). The obtained autocorrelation reveals oscillations at the same
frequency as unprocessed data. However, in the autocorrelated data the
shot noise is averaged out for all @xmath except for 0, where the shot
noise accumulates. Next we replace the autocorrelation value at @xmath
with the value at the smallest @xmath . This minimizes the influence of
shot noise without affecting the visibility of the oscillations. The
absolute value of the FFT (Fig. 10.1 f) of the autocorrelations
processed in such way exhibits a clear peak, which we associate with the
qubit oscillation frequency. Namely, the peak position in frequency,
@xmath , is used to extract @xmath via @xmath (Fig. 10.1 g).

#### 10.2 Gaussian distribution of @xmath

Several points of the analysis presented in the main text assume a
Gaussian distribution of the Overhauser field gradients. To show that
this assumption is justified we plot in Fig. 10.2 a histograms of @xmath
for several values of the external magnetic field. The fits to the data
confirm our assumption, indicating there spin bath does not have
multiple stable points, in contract to experiments involving intentional
dynamical nuclear polarization [ 133 , 72 , 134 ] . However we observe
that the mean Overhauser field gradient is shfted away from zero for
increasing external magnetic field, while the width of the @xmath
distribution remains unchanged (Fig. 10.2 b,c). We suspect that this
non-zero mean arises from unintentional nuclear polarization, as
reported previously for this device [ 64 , 94 ] and for devices studied
by other groups [ 108 ] .

#### 10.3 Obtaining power spectral density of @xmath from truncated
autocorrelation of single-shot measurements

As explained in the main text, to maximize the repetition rate at which
@xmath is probed, we fix the separation time @xmath ns and repeat the
pulse cycle continuously. Then we map S and T @xmath outcomes to,
respectively, @xmath and @xmath . As a result we obtain binary traces of
over 2 million points. A small piece of such a trace is presented in
Fig. 10.3 a, obtained for external magnetic field @xmath T and @xmath
ns.

The sequence of single-shot outcomes is dominated by shot noise, which
obscures the underlying oscillations when using conventional methods for
calculating the PSD. To eliminate this noise contribution, we apply the
same procedure mentioned in the previous section. That is, we find the
autocorrelation and replace its value at @xmath with the value at the
smallest @xmath . The autocorrelation of single-shot measurements for
@xmath T are plotted in Fig. 10.3 b. Now we can take advantage of the
fact that the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation is identical to
the power spectral density of the original trace.

Even though the sample is huge, we observe artifacts related to its
finite size. Namely, the autocorrelation has a long, irregular tail
(Fig. 10.3 b, inset). If we perform FFT over the entire available range
of @xmath , fluctuations in the tail dominate over the relevant features
at @xmath .

In our further analysis we assume that relevant information about the
nuclear noise at frequency @xmath is contained within the window @xmath
where @xmath is of the order of ten. In other words, to obtain an
accurate value of the power spectral density of the noise at frequency
@xmath , it is sufficient to take the Fourier transform of the
autocorrelation in the range @xmath . In our analysis we use @xmath . To
avoid the necessity of windowing we keep the range of @xmath such that
the number of points within the @xmath range is @xmath , for integer
@xmath .

Power spectral densities for @xmath T, @xmath ns, and various choices of
@xmath are presented in Fig. 10.3 c, visualizing the trade-off between
frequency range and noise floor level due to finite sample size. Wide
@xmath windows (i.e. large @xmath ) give access to lower frequencies but
raise the noise floor, while narrow @xmath windows sacrifice
low-frequency information for a reduction in noise. By adjusting the
window dynamically we are able to achieve a wide spectral range without
suffering from the background noise.

#### 10.4 Fitting procedures for PSD in Figs. 8.2c and 8.3

The classical diffusion model used to describe the experimental results
presented in Figs. 8.2 c and 8.3 , provides analytical expressions for
the autocorrelation of @xmath and @xmath , but no analytical expression
for the PSD. Therefore the fitted expressions involve numerical Fourier
transforms of the autocorrelation obtained from the analytical formulas.

To fit data in Fig. 8.2 c we simulate two sets of autocorrelation
traces, such that after performing a FFT they produce PSD points at the
same frequencies as in the experimental data. Simulated traces obtained
in such way are suitable for optimization via the method of least
squares.

To fit the data in Fig. 8.3 we simulate autocorrelation traces with
identical time resolution as the experimental data. To these traces we
then apply the same procedure as to experimental data (that is we
perform FFT of data limited to a suitable range of @xmath ). The
obtained set of frequencies is identical to those of the experimental
PSD, making this method suitable for least squares fitting.

#### 10.5 Classical model of Overhauser field noise due to nuclear spin
diffusion

Here we construct a model for the dynamics of a @xmath - @xmath qubit in
a double quantum dot, arising from slow fluctuations of the longitudinal
Overhauser (difference) field in the two dots. The Overhauser field is
produced by nuclear spins in the host crystal, which undergo their own
dynamics due to their mutual dipole-dipole coupling. These dynamics lead
to fluctuations of the longitudinal Overhauser field, which in turn
affect the evolution of the spin qubit, which plays the role of a sensor
in this work. Our approach is similar to that employed previously to
describe the results of the experiment in Ref. [ 95 ] .

The electronic system is influenced by the nuclear spins through the
hyperfine (hf) interaction,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the electron position operator, @xmath is the position
of nucleus @xmath , and @xmath and @xmath are the spin operators for the
electron and nucleus @xmath , respectively. Here @xmath has units @xmath
, with a characteristic value in GaAs of @xmath [ 10 ] , where @xmath is
the unit cell volume. For simplicity we consider a single nuclear
species. On a coarse-grained scale encompassing many atomic sites, we
describe the nuclear spin state in terms of a spin density field @xmath
. Throughout this treatment we focus only on the spin component parallel
to the externally-applied magnetic field. Here @xmath has units @xmath .

In a double dot, the @xmath singlet and triplet ( @xmath ) states are
coupled by the longitudinal Overhauser difference field

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the electronic effective @xmath -factor, @xmath is the
Bohr magneton, and @xmath , with @xmath and @xmath the electronic
density profiles in the right and left dot, respectively. Later it will
be convenient to work in Fourier space,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . Notably, although the nuclear spin field @xmath extends
throughout the entire sample, the Overhauser field is only sensitive to
the value of @xmath in a limited region where the electrons are
localized.

For simplicity, we take a model where the nuclear spin field @xmath
evolves under its own dynamics, unperturbed by the presence of the
electronic system. In the absence of nuclear spin relaxation (i.e., for
infinite nuclear @xmath ), the dipolar interaction between nuclear spins
leads to a diffusive-type dynamics of nuclear spin polarization:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a stochastic field that accounts for the randomness of
dipole-dipole induced nuclear spin flips. The units of @xmath are
[Energy / Volume]. Such a diffusive model is also expected to at least
qualitatively describe the dynamics caused by electron-mediated nuclear
flip-flops [ 117 ] .

The smooth diffusive dynamics, as described by the first term in Eq. (
10.4 ), are only manifested on timescales longer than that for a single
nuclear spin flip due to its interaction with its neighbors (typically
@xmath s for GaAs [ 10 ] ). On times longer than this scale, where the
diffusion model applies, the noise has zero average, @xmath , and is
essentially white: @xmath . Here the angle brackets indicate averaging
over noise realizations. The conservation of total nuclear spin is
ensured by taking the noise to have the following spatial correlations
on scales larger than the atomic lattice spacing:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the proportionality constant @xmath will be fixed below to ensure
the correct RMS value of the Overhauser difference field in equilibrium.
The units of @xmath are @xmath .

Fourier transforming Eq. ( 10.4 ), we obtain an independent differential
equation for each nuclear spin mode @xmath , labeled by the 3D wave
vector @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.6)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Fourier modes @xmath of the noise field satisfy

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.7)
  -- -------- -- --------

The differential equation ( 10.6 ) has the formal solution

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.8)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the explicit form for @xmath above, along with Eq. ( 10.7 ), we
obtain the correlation functions for the nuclear spin field:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.9)
  -- -------- -- --------

where in the second line we have used Eq. ( 10.7 ). If the initial state
@xmath is drawn from the (stationary) equilibrium distribution, @xmath ,
then we find

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.10)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In position space, the equilibrium Overhauser field fluctuations are
thus uncorrelated:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.11)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We now use the results above for the correlation function of the nuclear
spin field to calculate the noise correlations of the Overhauser
difference field, @xmath . The correlation function @xmath is
straightforward to evaluate using Eqs. ( 10.3 ) and ( 10.10 ):

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.12)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where we have used @xmath .

We set the value of @xmath by demanding that the equilibrium RMS
Overhauser field fluctuations should match the measured value:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.13)
  -- -------- -- ---------

To evaluate @xmath in the integrand above, we must specify a particular
form for the electron density profiles in the two dots. For simplicity
we take the densities in the two dots to be Gaussian, centered at
positions @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.14)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath . Setting @xmath and taking the Fourier transform of the
electron density in Eq. ( 10.14 ), we obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.15)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Rewriting @xmath and substituting into Eq. ( 10.13 ) gives

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (10.16)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

To cast the result into a more convenient form, we define the effective
number of spins @xmath in dot @xmath via @xmath , where @xmath is the
unit cell volume (see above). For the wave functions in Eq. ( 10.14 ) we
have @xmath . Letting @xmath , we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.17)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In this form, the @xmath dependence of the RMS Overhauser field
fluctuations is explicitly displayed.

The oscillations observed in Fig. 8.2 of the main text reveal the
magnitude of the gradient, but do not yield information about its sign .
Therefore the correlation function in Eq. ( 10.12 ), which depends on
both the magnitude and sign of @xmath , is not of direct relevance.
Instead, we compute the experimentally-relevant noise correlations and
power spectrum for @xmath . Assuming that the noise is Gaussian, which
is justified by the fact that the continuous nuclear spin field @xmath
is produced by a large density of randomly polarized individual spins,
the fourth-order correlators that appear in the expression for @xmath
can be factorized. This gives:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.18)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The integral in Eq. ( 10.18 ) is very similar to the one evaluated above
to compute the RMS nuclear field. Again using the electronic density
profile, Eq. ( 10.14 ), we get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.19)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Substituting back into Eq. ( 10.18 ), we get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.20)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The autocorrelation function in Eq. ( 10.20 ) above was used for fitting
the experimentally obtained power spectral densities for @xmath in Fig.
8.2 c. The geometric parameters were taken from the lithographic
dimensions of the device, and known growth parameters of the
heterostructure: @xmath nm, @xmath nm, and @xmath nm. The diffusion
constant @xmath and the equilibrium nuclear field fluctuations @xmath ,
see Eqs. ( 10.13 ) and ( 10.17 ), were taken as fit parameters. The
extracted values were @xmath nm @xmath and @xmath mT.

##### 10.5.1 Correlations for fixed separation time

In Fig. 8.3 of the main text, power spectral densities for measurements
of the singlet return probability with fixed separation time are shown.
This type of measurement was employed previously by Reilly and coworkers
[ 95 ] . For separation time @xmath , the singlet return probability
@xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.21)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Here we assume that @xmath is frozen on the timescale of one experiment,
but its value may change from run to run. Averaging over Gaussian
fluctuations gives

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.22)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Using Eq. ( 10.21 ), the autocorrelation function @xmath then follows
(as also found in Ref. [ 95 ] ):

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.23)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The quantity @xmath in the exponent was calculated above, see Eq. (
10.13 ) and below. Furthermore, the correlation function @xmath was
calculated in Eq. ( 10.19 ). Thus we obtain the autocorrelation function
for the singlet return probability in experiments with fixed separation
time, used for fitting the data in Fig. 8.3 of the main text.

#### 10.6 Decoherence of the qubit subjected to the transverse
Overhauser noise

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.24)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath with @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath are the operators of
Overhauser field components, given by @xmath , in which @xmath are the
spin operators of @xmath -th nucleus and @xmath (with @xmath being the
envelope wavefunction of the electron in dot @xmath , @xmath the
hyperfine interaction energy for nucleus of species @xmath , and @xmath
the position of @xmath -th nucleus) are the hyperfine couplings of the
@xmath -th nucleus to the electron in dot @xmath .

When the exchange interaction between the two electrons is strongly
suppressed due to a large barrier height separating the two potential
minima [ 64 ] , the overlap between the @xmath and @xmath functions is
negligible, and every contributing nucleus is coupled only to one
electron, residing either in @xmath or @xmath dot. The Hamiltonian (
10.24 ) is then a sum of two commuting terms, each pertaining to another
dot. We also assume that the nuclear density matrices in the two dots
are uncorrelated, and that the @xmath and @xmath dots have the same size
and shape. The singlet return probability @xmath is then given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.25)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the coherence function of a single spin in one of the
QDs (i.e. an off-diagonal element of its density matrix normalized to
unity), calculated for the respective dynamical decoupling sequence.

Although the longitudinal and transverse Overhauser field operators do
not strictly commute, their commutator is @xmath , where @xmath is the
rms of the Overhauser field and @xmath is the number of nuclei
appreciably interacting with the electron [ 132 ] . In the following we
use a semiclassical approach to dynamics of large nuclear bath, and
neglect this commutator. The decoherence function can then be written as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.26)
  -- -------- -- ---------

in which @xmath is the contribution to decoherence that originates from
the first (longitudinal) term in Eq. ( 10.24 ), while @xmath is the
contribution due to the second term (quadratic in transverse Overhauser
operators).

The Hamiltonian of the nuclei is the sum of a Zeeman term, a quadrupolar
splitting term, and a dipole-dipole interaction term:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (10.27)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath and @xmath are the Zeeman and quadrupolar splittings of the
@xmath -th nucleus respectively, and @xmath is the dipolar coupling
between @xmath and @xmath nuclei.

It is important to note that @xmath calculated for echo or other
dynamical decoupling sequences has noticeable time-dependence due to the
presence of @xmath and @xmath terms involving only single nuclei. The
characteristic oscillations of @xmath for spin echo [ 143 , 10 , 74 ,
132 , 108 ] and for CPMG [ 94 ] arise from the presence of three
distinct nuclear Larmor precession frequencies in GaAs. In contrast, the
echo decay envelope was explained [ 74 , 132 , 94 , 108 ] by the
presence of a quadrupolar-induced spread of effective fields @xmath ,
with @xmath sufficiently large to dominate over broadening due to @xmath
dipolar interactions. Reported values are @xmath mT in [ 74 ] and @xmath
mT in [ 94 , 108 ] . On the other hand, the decay of @xmath is solely
due to the dipolar @xmath flip-flop term, which does not commute with
@xmath and thus leads to dynamics of the longitudinal Overhauser field.

We calculate @xmath using a semiclassical theory [ 132 ] , in which the
averages of products of any number @xmath are evaluated to the lowest
order in @xmath expansion [ 143 , 10 ] . Following [ 10 , 132 ] we
define a @xmath -matrix, the components of which are given by

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (10.28)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath labels the group of @xmath nuclei having (approximately)
common values of hf coupling @xmath and Zeeman splitting @xmath , @xmath
is the time-domain filter function corresponding to the given pulse
sequence ( @xmath is nonzero for @xmath , and it changes between @xmath
and @xmath value at times at which @xmath pulses are applied), @xmath is
the length of individual nuclear spins (assumed to be the same for all
spins, as is the case for GaAs, for which @xmath ), and @xmath , @xmath
. We have then [ 143 , 10 , 132 ]

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.29)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath .

For a spin echo sequence of length @xmath the @xmath -matrix is given by
[ 143 , 10 , 132 ]

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (10.30)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

while for a CMPG sequence with even number of pulses @xmath and
interpulse spacing @xmath we have [ 94 ]

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (10.31)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the rms strength of the Overhauser field arising from
@xmath spins, all spins having Knight shift @xmath .

It is crucial now to recognize the distinct roles of two kinds of
contributions to the @xmath -matrix: the heteronuclear ones, in which
@xmath and @xmath correspond to distinct nuclear isotopes (i.e. @xmath
Ga, @xmath Ga, and @xmath As in the case of GaAs, labeled by @xmath ),
so that @xmath , and the homonuclear ones, in which @xmath and @xmath
correspond to groups of nuclei of the same isotope, so that @xmath . The
former terms govern the presence of characteristic oscillations of
@xmath in echo [ 74 , 108 , 94 ] and CPMG case [ 94 ] , while the latter
smooth these oscillations in CPMG case and, more importantly, lead to an
irreversible decay of the signal. Note that the homonuclear terms are
nonzero in the presence of intra-species spread of nuclear splittings,
thereby contributing to low- and intermediate-frequency noise.

Note that the dependence of @xmath on Knight shift differences @xmath is
negligible in experimentally relevant range of parameters for both
homonuclear and heteronuclear terms. For QD with number of nuclei @xmath
we have @xmath for @xmath @xmath s. For heteronuclear terms we can then
put @xmath in Eqs. ( 10.30 ) and ( 10.31 ) provided that @xmath (which
is fulfilled for @xmath mT in dots considered here), while for
homonuclear terms for isotope @xmath we have to assume that @xmath
(which is easily fulfilled for considered values of @xmath with @xmath
mT used here). We can then perform the calculation by dividing the
nuclei of each isotope into @xmath groups, each having the same @xmath
(equal to the typical hf coupling for a give isotope), value of @xmath
taken from @xmath range, and @xmath taken from a Gaussian distribution:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.32)
  -- -------- -- ---------

in which @xmath is the rms value of the nuclear splitting due to a
spread @xmath of the effective field experienced by the nuclei. The
calculations converge on timescales relevant for measurements presented
in this paper for @xmath for @xmath pulses (and for smaller @xmath for
lower numbers of pulses).

Examples of results for @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath
are shown in Fig. 10.5 . In the calculations we have used the values of
@xmath , with @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath @xmath eV, and @xmath ,
@xmath , and @xmath neV at @xmath T field corresponding to @xmath Ga,
@xmath Ga, and @xmath As, respectively (note that @xmath here is the
number of nuclei, while in [ 10 ] it denoted the number of unit cells,
i.e. twice the number of nuclei). The experimental results presented in
the main text are best fit by @xmath in each dot, and effective
broadening @xmath corresponding to @xmath mT field, and these are the
values used in Fig. 10.5 .

The key observation is that the calculated @xmath can be very well
approximated by a product of decoherence functions calculated while
keeping only the homonuclear terms and only the heteronuclear ones:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.33)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The heteronuclear term is responsible for large-amplitude oscillations
of the signal, while the homonuclear term gives a decay envelope of the
coherence signal, see Fig. 10.5 . Furthermore, the homonuclear
contribution can be approximated very well (at least on timescale of the
signal decay) by a simple solution obtained using a bimodal
approximation to the distribution of @xmath frequencies of nuclei of
each species (first used for spin echo case in [ 132 ] ). In this
approximation we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.34)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where for echo we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.35)
  -- -------- -- ---------

while for CPMG sequence with even @xmath we obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.36)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This is the main result here: when decoherence due to tranvserse
Overhauser field fluctuations is dominated by the homonuclear
contribution, the characteristic coherence half-decay time @xmath
(defined by @xmath ) scales linearly with the number of pulses @xmath ,
i.e. we have @xmath with @xmath .

#### 11.1 Calibration of @xmath pulses

To generate decoupling sequences consisting of as many as 1000 @xmath
pulses we took advantage of charge-noise-insensitive symmetric exchange
pulses. This new technique improves the quality factor of exchange
oscillations by a factor of six relative to conventional method of
tilting the double dot potential [ 64 , 68 ] . A detailed analysis of
this technique, and results obtained in the preceding experiment from
the same setup and same sample, can be found in Ref. [ 64 , 84 ] .

The optimization was performed by maximizing the Hahn echo signal by
varying the amplitude of the symmetric exchange pulse, @xmath , while
keeping detuning @xmath mV, exchange time @xmath ns and total evolution
time @xmath @xmath s fixed (Fig. 11.1 ). The experiment was performed on
the same device and in identical tuning as Ref. [ 64 ] , where @xmath
and @xmath are defined and discussed in detail.

We note that symmetric exchange pulses show a weaker dependence on gate
voltages than ordinary tilt pulses. Hence, symmetric @xmath pulses are
more robust against fluctuations of pulse amplitudes. On the other hand,
symmetric pulses require a larger amplitude, resulting in somewhat
slower exchange gates compared to conventional tilted exchange gates.
This limitation makes @xmath pulses more susceptible to errors induced
by gradients of the Overhauser field, causing a tilted rotation axis of
the qubit. In future experiments, larger pulse amplitudes can be
achieved straightforwardly by decreasing the attenuation in the
transmission lines in the cryostat.

Nevertheless, the CPMG sequence is particularly robust to two kinds of
@xmath pulse errors that affect exchange gates [ 150 ] . The first is
over or under rotation around the vertical axis of the Bloch sphere due
to miscalibration of pulse amplitude and duration. The second is tilt of
the rotation axis in the @xmath - @xmath – @xmath - @xmath plane due to
uncontrolled gradients of the Overhauser field.

#### 11.2 Semiclassical model for decoherence

The inset of Fig. 4 shows theoretical results for coherence revivals.
The model is derived closely following the semiclassical approach
developed in Ref. [ 132 ] . The starting point is to express the
Hamiltonian for the @xmath , @xmath subspace of the two-spin system as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (11.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the electron @xmath -factor, @xmath is the Bohr
magneton, @xmath is the external magnetic field, @xmath ( @xmath ) is
the Overhauser field component parallel (perpendicular) to external
magnetic field, @xmath is the electron spin operator, @xmath labels the
left and right dots, and we assume @xmath . Here, the sequence of @xmath
pulses applied to the qubit is captured by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (11.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the time at which the @xmath -th @xmath pulse of the
CPMG sequence is applied (with @xmath , @xmath ), and @xmath is the
Heaviside step function.

Reference [ 132 ] treated only the Hahn echo sequence. This corresponds
to @xmath in the above. Following the same sequence of steps, we obtain
results for arbitrary @xmath . As in that case, the decoherence function
@xmath is separated into a product of contributions from the
longitudinal and transverse noise sources. The low-frequency
longitudinal noise contribution is of the form @xmath , where @xmath is
related to the exponent in the power law @xmath describing the spectrum
of this noise source [ 141 ] , and @xmath is the spectral diffusion
time. Because the transverse field enters the Hamiltonian ( 11.1 ) as a
square, @xmath , this noise source is effectively non-Gaussian [ 98 ,
132 ] . As a result, the decoherence function for dot @xmath is of the
form @xmath with components of the matrix @xmath given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (11.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here @xmath labels groups of nuclei associated by isotope and local
nuclear Zeeman coupling, @xmath is the hyperfine coupling constant for
nuclei in group @xmath , @xmath , @xmath is number of nuclei in a group,
@xmath is a difference of Larmor frequencies between nuclei from two
groups, and @xmath is the total evolution time. Specifically, the nuclei
of each isotope are divided into @xmath groups using the relation @xmath
, where @xmath is the number of nuclei of isotope @xmath per unit cell,
and where all nuclei within each group have the same Larmor angular
frequency @xmath . The value of @xmath for each group is drawn from a
Gaussian distribution centered at the bare Larmor frequency @xmath for
the corresponding isotope, with standard deviation @xmath . The
broadening @xmath is introduced as a phenomenological parameter to take
into account an effective spread in the Larmor frequencies due to
inhomogeneous quadrupolar splittings and dipole-dipole interactions. For
the simulation shown in Fig. 4, differences between hyperfine couplings
within the same isotope were neglected, and convergence was obtained
with @xmath groups.

Larmor frequencies and hyperfine couplings used to perform the
simulation shown in Fig. 4 were taken from Ref. [ 10 ] (table 11.1 ).
The remaining parameters are: the effective number, @xmath , of nuclei
interacting with each electron, inhomogeneity, @xmath , of the effective
magnetic field acting on the nuclei, the spectral diffusion time, @xmath
, and the exponent, @xmath , associated with the low-frequency noise.
The following sections explain how these parameters are obtained.

#### 11.3 Estimating @xmath and @xmath from Hahn echo signal

The simulation of revivals under CPMG sequences requires knowledge of
four device-specific parameters, two of which, the effective number,
@xmath , of nuclei interacting with each electron and the inhomogeneity,
@xmath , of the effective magnetic field acting on the nuclei, are
extracted from Hahn echo data obtained at several magnetic fields (Fig.
11.2 ). Following previous work [ 74 , 132 ] we first fit theory to Hahn
echo data at each magnetic field separately, keeping @xmath , @xmath ,
the spectral diffusion time for Hahn echo, @xmath , vertical offset, and
vertical scaling as free parameters. Setting @xmath ms gives essentially
equally good fits (i.e. @xmath cannot be determined accurately by this
method) but values for @xmath and @xmath obtained at various magnetic
fields (150-350 mT) differ from each other by less than 20%. Therefore
we average these values and obtain @xmath mT and @xmath . Fixing these
values and @xmath , we leave the vertical offset and vertical scaling as
the only free parameters, and obtain excellent agreement for all
magnetic fields, as seen in Fig. 11.2 . Visibility and offset are left
as free parameters, independent for each curve, to accommodate a
fluctuating readout visibility that is likely due to a buildup of the
gradient of Overhauser field for large @xmath [ 75 ] .

The only systematic deviation between the experimental results and the
model is a slight, rapid, initial decay of the signal (first 3-5 data
points of each data set). This effect was also observed in Refs. [ 74 ,
108 ] . The effect depended on the external magnetic field as well as
the gradient of the Overhauser field [ 108 ] , and was speculated to be
related to the entanglement of the qubit with the nuclear bath or to
@xmath pulse errors [ 74 ] .

#### 11.4 Estimating @xmath and @xmath scaling of coherence time

To estimate the spectral diffusion time @xmath for the simulation in
Fig. 4a we quantify the scaling of the CPMG coherence time with the
number of @xmath pulses @xmath in a regime where revivals are not yet
developed (i.e., for @xmath at 750 mT) [ 141 ] . The coherence time is
found to be proportional to @xmath , with @xmath [ 94 ] . Using this
scaling behaviour we infer @xmath ms for a CPMG sequence with 256 @xmath
-pulses. Using the relationship @xmath [ 141 ] the exponent @xmath
corresponds to a power law of low-frequency noise governed by @xmath
behaviour, with @xmath , in reasonable agreement with previous
measurements [ 141 ] .

#### 11.5 Splitting of the first revival peak

A possible explanation for the observed splitting in the first revival
peak (Fig. 4a) is based on the anisotropy of the electronic @xmath
-factor. The @xmath -factor anisotropy between [011] and [01-1] primary
axes can be as high as 15% in asymmetric GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells [ 151
] . In Ref. [ 108 ] it was shown that the anisotropy has a strong impact
on @xmath - @xmath qubit coherence when the magnetic field is not
parallel to one of the main axes. The combination of the anisotropy and
small misalignment of the external magnetic field with the [011] crystal
axis changes the magnetic field term in the system Hamiltonian ( 11.1 )
to:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (11.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath ( @xmath ) are diagonal (off-diagonal) elements of a @xmath
-tensor in the basis set by direction of the external magnetic field.
The latter leads to the appearance of individual nuclear Larmor
frequencies in the nuclear noise spectrum in addition to nuclear
difference frequencies [ 108 ] . As a result, the CPMG sequence will not
be as efficient in suppressing nuclear noise even when the pulses are
commensurate with all three difference frequencies.

In Fig. 11.3 we present simulations showing the consequences of @xmath
-factor anisotropy. Panel (a) shows the simulation presented in the
inset of Fig. 4a, i.e. @xmath . In panel (b) we show a simulation that
assumes @xmath . Although our external magnetic field was nominally
aligned with the [011] crystal axis (cf. Fig. 9.1 a), the choice of
@xmath is consistent with the smallest value observed in [ 108 ] for the
same direction of magnetic field as in our setup. In our simulation a
splitting of the first revival peak appears (indicated by a white arrow)
as well as more complex fine structure in other revival peaks. Such fine
structure is beyond the resolution of the experimental data.

We note that a splitting of the first revival peak appears exactly when
the frequency of @xmath pulses coincides with a difference of Larmor
frequencies @xmath and @xmath . Therefore other mechanisms might also
lead to the appearance of the splitting. We speculate that weak driving
of the nuclei by a periodic Knight field could enhance flip-flops
between nuclei of different species and therefore increase spin
diffusion, leading to faster decoherence.

#### 11.6 Unpublished: CPMG revival maps for 32, 64 and 128 @xmath
pulses

The measurement of the CPMG decay as a function of the magnetic field,
such as in Fig. 9.4 a, was also repeated for smaller number of @xmath
pulses (Fig. 11.4 ). Here we can see that more and more ridges are
visible for CPMG sequences with fewer @xmath pulses. For @xmath we can
see that mysterious features before the first revival ridge and the
splitting of the first revival ridge persist as well.

[width=0.8breakable, size=minimal, colback=white] We study the ground
state spin of nine subsequent occupancies of the multielectron GaAs
quantum dot, by means of coupling it to the neighboring two-electron
double quantum dot. For all nine occupancies we map the crossing of the
spin states as a function of the external magnetic field, in the
vicinity of the interdot charge transition between a single- and a
multielectron quantum dot. We also perform a time-resolved measurement
of the exchange oscillations in the same regime. These measurements
enable us to identify even and odd occupancies of the multielectron
quantum dot. For three even occupancies we observe no exchange
interaction leading indicating a spin-0 ground state. For one even
occupancy we observe the exchange interaction and assign a spin 1 to the
multielectron quantum dot ground state. For all five odd occupancies we
observe the exchange interaction and assign a spin 1/2 to the ground
state. We demonstrate that for three odd occupancies the exchange
interaction changes sign in the vicinity of the charge transition. For
one of these the exchange interaction is negative (i.e.
triplet-preferring) beyond the interdot charge transition, consistently
with the observed spin-1 for the next occupancy. We develop the Hubbard
model involving two orbitals of the multielectron quantum dot. Allowing
for the spin correlation energy (i.e. including a term favoring the
Hund’s rules) and different tunnel coupling to different orbitals we
qualitatively reproduce the measured exchange profiles.

#### 12.1 Introduction

Spins in semiconductornanostructures offer a wide variety of approaches
to quantum computing. These include approaches based on gate-defined
single-electron quantum dots realized in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures [
87 , 37 , 88 , 152 , 60 , 94 , 153 ] , Si/SiGe quantum wells [ 14 , 58 ,
51 , 18 , 19 ] or in MOS nanodevices [ 20 , 15 ] , as well as spins
localized on crystal defects such as phosphorus donors in silicon [ 13 ,
61 ] . Along with the range of materials, spins trapped in quantum dots
offer a myriad of qubit encodings, including single- [ 20 , 18 , 19 ] ,
double- [ 45 , 14 , 58 , 113 ] and triple-dot [ 52 , 50 , 51 ] schemes,
each with distinct advantages.

In contrast to the vast range of spin qubit encodings, there are only a
handful of demonstrations of two-qubit entangling operations [ 87 , 37 ,
22 , 21 ] that are required for quantum computing. Approaches to
two-qubit entangling gates based on direct exchange interaction between
neighboring tunnel-coupled quantum dots [ 87 , 21 ] offer fast,
high-fidelity operation [ 64 , 68 ] . Unfortunately, these approaches
require the dots to be extremely close, which makes fabrication and
cross-coupling between qubits a challenge for multi-qubit systems [ 154
, 155 , 40 ] . In contrast, approaches based on direct charge
dipole-dipole interaction can offer longer ranges, but suffer from weak
coupling (and thus slow gate times) and comparatively lower fidelities [
37 , 22 ] . This dipole-dipole interaction could be mediated by a
superconducting cavity [ 156 , 157 , 158 , 23 , 92 , 55 ] , providing a
mechanism to couple over even longer distances, which is commonly used
for superconducting qubits [ 159 ] . However, the small dipole moments
and susceptibility to charge noise make it unclear whether these
approaches will lead to improvements in gate speed and fidelity.

An attractive alternative that has recently been proposed [ 160 , 161 ]
and demonstrated [ 162 , 163 ] is to base two-qubit coupling on the fast
exchange interaction, using an intermediate quantum system as a
mediator. This approach combines the fast coupling of the exchange
interaction with the ability to arrange quantum dots at separations that
are compatible with current fabrication techniques. In particular, a
mesoscopic multielectron quantum dot [ 164 , 165 , 166 , 167 , 168 , 169
] could serve as both coupling mediator and spacer [ 163 ] , providing a
pathway for scalability to multi-qubit systems.

To serve as a mediator and spacer, a multielectron quantum dot needs to
fulfill several requirements:

1.  Its physical size must space neighboring dots by at least a few
    hundred nanometers. This distance is necessary to facilitate the
    fabrication of all of the required control and readout gates for
    each qubit. It would also be necessary if one wished to couple more
    than two qubits to the mediator.

2.  The spin of the multielectron quantum dot ground state must be well
    defined, to enable the interaction between qubits without entangling
    with the mediator [ 170 ] . The multielectron quantum dot with a
    non-degenerate spinless ground state would be the easiest to exploit
    as a coupler [ 161 , 160 ] .

3.  The level spacing of the multielectron quantum dot and the tunnel
    couplings must be larger than the energy of the thermal fluctuations
    ( @xmath @xmath eV for @xmath mK) and the excitation spectrum of the
    control voltage pulses ( @xmath @xmath eV for 5 GHz bandwidth). This
    condition is necessary to guarantee that the mediator will be
    prepared in the ground state and to avoid its accidental excitation.

4.  The ground state spin, level spacing and tunnel coupling of the
    multielectron quantum dot must be tunable with a high yield. These
    parameters depend on the mesoscopic details of the multielectron
    dot, which may not be easily controlled.

5.  The strength of the exchange interaction must provide a competitive
    timescale for two qubit gates. We estimate that 100 ns is the upper
    bound on a viable two-qubit gate. This puts a bound on the minimum
    coupling strength of roughly @xmath @xmath eV.

In this article, we demonstrate that these requirements can be fulfilled
by a multi-electron quantum dot (except for the final requirement,
addressed elsewhere [ 163 ] ). We implement a composite system
consisting of the two-electron double quantum dot coupled to the
multielectron quantum dot in GaAs device [Fig. 12.1 (a),(b)]. Our
approach is to study the interaction of one of the electrons in a
two-electron double quantum dot with a multielectron quantum dot, in the
vicinity of the charge transition at which the single electron tunnels
into the multielectron quantum dot. The double quantum dot provides a
mechanism to prepare the electronic spin state and for spin readout.

By these means, we study the properties of the multi-electron dot in
nine different charge occupancies. We are able to identify even and odd
occupancy of the dot. In all of the cases we are able to identify the
total spin of the ground state of the multielectron quantum dot; in
terms of the occupancy of the dot, the ground states form a sequence of
alternating spin-0 (even occupancy) and spin-1/2 (odd occupancy) states
interrupted once by single case of a spin-1 ground state in a dot with
even occupancy. This progression of the ground state spin is consistent
with previous studies of the ground state spin of a multielectron
quantum dot [ 167 , 171 ] .

Moreover, we discover a peculiar behavior of the exchange interaction at
the charge transition for the case of spin 1/2 multielectron dot ground
state. Namely, the exchange interaction changes sign as a result of a
few-millivolt change of a dot-defining gate voltages. A Hubbard model
that includes two levels of the multielectron dot enables us to capture
the energetics associated with the total spin of the multielectron
quantum dot. From that model we derive a “phase diagram” that indicates
four regimes with qualitatively distinct energy spectra and associated
exchange interaction dependencies.

The article is organized as follows. In Sec. 12.2 we describe in detail
the studied system and the sequences of voltage pulses used to induce
the interaction between a single electron an the multielectron quantum
dot. In Sec. 12.3 we present the sequence of the observed ground states
as the occupancy of the multielectron quantum dot is increased one
electron at the time. This enables us to propose a Hubbard model for
description of the multielectron quantum dot. In Sec. 12.4 we present
the evidence for the spin 0 ground state for three of the studied
electron occupancies. Sec. 12.5 contains an in-depth study of the
interaction between an electron and spin-1/2 state of the multielectron
quantum dot for five different electron occupancies. In Sec. 12.6 we
present the data supporting the observation of a spin-1 ground state. In
the final Sec. 12.7 we summarize the results.

#### 12.2 Experimental setup and techniques

The quantum dots are defined in GaAs/AlGaAs two-dimensional electron gas
(2DEG), with electron density @xmath m @xmath and a mobility @xmath m
@xmath /Vs. The 2DEG is located 57 nm below the heterostructure surface.
A layer of HfO @xmath of thickness of 10 nm is deposited on top of the
heterostructure to isolate the gold gates defined on top by electron
beam lithography. The oxide layer has a double purpose: first, it
prevents the current leakage through the Schottky barrier that would
appear under application of positive voltage to metallic gate deposited
directly on top of GaAs; second, it blocks the tunneling events between
the gates and the donor layer, which are the main sources of the samples
instability [ 41 ] . The experiment is performed in the dilution
refrigerator with the mixing chamber at 20 mK.

The SEM of the innermost part of the device is presented in Fig. 12.1
(a). The light gray and colored structures are the metallic gates that
are used to define the quantum dot confining potential. The
green-colored accumulation gate is operated at small positive voltage of
+40 mV. The remaining gates are operated at negative voltages to deplete
the 2DEG. The accumulation gate is introduced in this design to increase
the depth the quantum dot potential and improve the tunability. With the
use of accumulation gates the typical center-to-center distance of the
single-electron quantum dots is 150 nm, which is approximately 30% less
than in designs that do not employ the accumulation gate [ 50 , 172 , 22
] .

In our device we tune two single electron quantum dots and a
multielectron quantum dot, under the accumulation gate, in the region
indicated by a dashed rectangle. Based on the 2DEG density and the
device geometry (dot size roughly 120 @xmath 250 nm) we estimate the
electron occupancy of the multielectron quantum dot to be between 50 and
100. Splitting of the accumulation gate has no effect on the formation
of the multielectron dot. In red we indicate the gates, labeled @xmath
connected to the wide bandwidth coaxial lines in the dilution
refrigerator. Voltage pulses on these gates are used to perform the
sub-microsecond charge and spin manipulations, while all DC gate
voltages are modified to explore various occupancies of the
multielectron dot.

In Fig. 12.1 (c) we present the typical charge diagrams of the
double-dot – multielectron-dot system. On the left we present the charge
diagram with respect to gate voltages @xmath and @xmath . These gate
voltages are dedicated to control the state of the double quantum dot.
This diagram presents the interdot charge transition for the double dot,
connecting the (2,0, @xmath ) and (1,1, @xmath ) charge states, where (
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath ) indicates a number of electrons in the left,
middle and multielectron dot, respectively. By adjusting the voltages
@xmath and @xmath , in such a way that we remain on the gate voltage
axis labeled @xmath [Fig. 12.1 (c), left panel] we control the position
of the electrons in the double dot while maintaining the fixed number of
the electrons on the multielectron dot.

On the @xmath axis we define a point @xmath that serves as the
preparation and readout of the double quantum dot spin state. We also
define a separation point @xmath at which the electrons in the double
dot do not interact with the multielectron quantum dot and weakly
exchange interact with each other. For symbols @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath we will use the subscript @xmath to indicate the initial
occupancy of the multielectron dot. Having chosen the separation point
@xmath we map out the dot occupancies as a function of voltages @xmath
and @xmath as illustrated in the right panel of Fig. 12.1 (c). In this
charge diagram we identify the point @xmath in the gate voltage space.
Once we identify that point we define @xmath axis that contains the
@xmath point and goes through the interdot charge transition connecting
the (1,1, @xmath ) and (1,0, @xmath ) charge states. By controlling the
position on this axis we can induce the interaction between a single
electron and a multielectron quantum dot, while preserving the reference
electronic spin in the leftmost quantum dot. By slightly changing the DC
tuning of the quantum dots, we can change the occupancy of the
multielectron dot and define analogous axis for different charge states.
These are schematically illustrated with the axes labeled @xmath and
@xmath in Fig. 12.1 (c).

Having defined the points @xmath , @xmath and axes @xmath and @xmath for
each occupancy @xmath of the multielectron quantum dot, we can perform
pulses of the gate voltage pulses that will take us between the (2,0,
@xmath ), (1,1, @xmath ) and (1,0, @xmath ) charge states and allow to
study the interaction of the single electron with the multielectron
quantum dot [illustrated in Fig. 12.1 (d),(e)]. The pulse initiates at
point @xmath , with a pair of electrons prepared in the singlet state
@xmath on the leftmost quantum dot. From there, we move to the point
@xmath and separate the two electrons. We wait a single clock cycle of
the waveform generator at point @xmath , which varies between 0.83 and
2.5 ns. This step is necessary to ensure that we transfer the electron
through the middle dot to the multielectron, instead of ejecting it into
a lead, followed by injection of the electron to the multielectron dot
from the opposite side. The waiting time is shorter then the dephasing
time due to interaction with the nuclear spins [ 7 , 95 , 72 ] , @xmath
ns. The next step of the pulse moves along the @xmath axis for time
@xmath . Both parameters @xmath and @xmath are varied within a sequence
of pulses. It is during this stage that the interaction between the
electron and multielectron quantum dot occurs. We then return to the
point @xmath for another clock cycle of the waveform generator. Finally,
we pulse back to the (2,0, @xmath ) charge configuration at point @xmath
. This charge configuration is reached only if the pair of electrons on
the double quantum dot forms a spin singlet state, otherwise the system
is blocked in (1,1, @xmath ) charge state. The reflectometry readout of
the conductance trough the neighboring sensor dot lasting between 5 and
20 @xmath s allows us to distinguish these states yielding a single-shot
spin readout.

#### 12.3 The multielectron quantum dot

Before we discuss the experiments revealing the exchange interaction
between a single electron and a multielectron quantum dot, we present
and discuss a model that can be used to describe the multielectron
quantum dot and its coupling to the double dot.

For the several subsequent occupancies we observe alternating sequence
of spin-0 and spin-1/2 ground states as summarized in Tab. 12.1
(inferred from experiments described in sections 12.4 - 12.6 ). This
sequence is interrupted once by a spin-1 ground state instead of spin-0.
These are consistent with findings of Folk et al. [ 167 ] and Lindemann
et al. [ 171 ] who identify the ground states spin by studying the
change of the Coulomb peak spacing in magnetic field. Based on these
observations we model the multielectron quantum dot with the
Hamiltonian:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (12.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the electron charge; @xmath is the dot self-capacitance;
@xmath is the operator counting the total number of electrons; @xmath
are the annihilation (creation) operators for electron on the single
particle level @xmath with spin @xmath ; @xmath are the energies of the
single particle levels; @xmath is the total spin operator and @xmath is
the spin correlation energy. The subscript @xmath in this formula refers
to the multielectron dot as right dot, as opposed to the left ( @xmath )
and middle ( @xmath ) single-electron dots.

The relative strength of the three terms present in this Hamiltonian
determine the properties of the multielectron quantum dot. The charging
energy of the multielectron quantum dot @xmath meV is estimated from the
distance between the multielectron dot charge transitions [ @xmath mV;
Fig. 12.1 (c)] and typical lever arm between the gates and the dots in
devices of similar design ( @xmath ). The charging energy may vary
slightly as a function of the dot occupancy, as with additional
electrons the quantum dots increase in size. For the results presented
here it is only relevant that the charging energy is much larger than
all other energy scales.

From the lithographic size of the device, we estimate the typical level
spacing [ 173 ] to be @xmath @xmath eV, where @xmath is the reduced
Planck constant, @xmath is the effective electron mass in GaAs and
@xmath is the area of the 2-dimensional quantum dot. However, the lack
of symmetry causes the level spacings to vary. It remains an open
question of how the distribution of the level spacings @xmath and
correlations between them are determined for a given mesoscopic quantum
dot. These kind of distributions may be described using random matrix
theory with the orthogonal ensemble [ 164 , 167 , 174 , 175 , 176 ] ,
which by itself neglects the interaction effect. The interaction effects
are usually introduced by means of random-phase approximation [ 177 ] ,
mean-field approximation [ 176 ] , using density functional theory [ 178
] , Anderson model [ 179 ] or by an on-site Hubbard interaction term [
174 ] (for review see Ref. [ 168 ] ). For the results presented here it
is most relevant that the level spacings distribution has the width
@xmath comparable to @xmath and @xmath . Also, the excitation spectrum
is highly correlated for a few subsequent charge states [ 166 ] .

In general, the spin correlation energy @xmath is the most difficult
quantity to estimate due to the lack of data in the literature. We make
the assumption that @xmath comparable, but smaller than, @xmath , based
on two observations. On the one hand there is no macroscopic
polarization of the electronic spins, which would originate from the
Stoner instability that appears in case [ 180 , 175 , 168 ] @xmath . On
the other hand, it is not uncommon that the ground state has a spin
@xmath , which can occur only when energy of the first excited state is
smaller than @xmath . This excludes the possibility @xmath .

From the perspective of designing two-qubit entangling gates,
configurations of the multielectron quantum dot with total spin 0 are
desirable. In our study, we observe a spin-0 ground state for 3 out of 4
even occupancies. We claim this provides sufficient reliability for use
in a scalable quantum dot system – in case of finding the spin-1 ground
state of the coupler it is sufficient to change its occupancy by 2.

Starting from the multielectron-dot Hamiltonian (Eq. 12.1 ), we
construct a simplified model that is sufficient to describe a
multielectron dot with a given occupancy to which a neighbouring double
quantum dot is coupled. We include a gate voltage @xmath tuned such that
the ground state charge configuration of the multielectron dot has
@xmath electrons, where @xmath is the gate capacitance. For the spin-0
case we consider here, @xmath is even. The Coulomb energy term in the
Hamiltonian with this gate voltage is then given by @xmath , where
@xmath describes the number of excess electrons on the multielectron dot
in addition to the electrons paired up as singlets and forming an
effective spin-0 “vacuum”. We can now consider a restricted model of the
multielectron dot, where we need only describe the multielectron dot
level @xmath corresponding to the lowest unoccupied level (or levels) of
the dot above this effective “vacuum”, and label this level by @xmath
rather than @xmath . (If we wish to consider more levels, they are
labelled @xmath , @xmath , etc.) The excess occupancy @xmath counts the
electrons with spin @xmath in this single level and is restricted to 0
or 1. As the occupancy is restricted, we can combine the energies of the
Couloumb term @xmath with the energy levels @xmath into a single
Hamiltonian term describing the energetics of the multielectron dot:
@xmath .

Our study involves modeling of the interaction between the spin
occupying the middle dot @xmath [Fig. 12.1 (b)] and one of the
aforementioned levels of the multielectron quantum dot. The occupancy of
the multielectron quantum dot will determine the nature of this
interaction. We consider three cases, ordered by increasing complexity:

-   All levels of the multielectron quantum dot are empty or doubly
    occupied and the total spin is zero. In this case, the interaction
    of the double quantum dot with the multielectron quantum dot can be
    modeled as an effective interaction of the spin of the middle dot
    @xmath tunnel coupled to an unoccupied dot @xmath (Sec. 12.4 ).

-   There is a single unpaired spin in the multielectron quantum dot,
    and so it has a total spin 1/2 (Sec. 12.5 ). In this case, the
    interaction of the double quantum dot with the multielectron quantum
    dot can be modeled as an effective interaction of the spin of the
    middle dot @xmath tunnel coupled to a single spin in the right dot
    @xmath . Depending on the details of the spin interaction terms of
    the multielectron quantum dot, we must consider both the partially
    occupied level of the multielectron quantum dot as well as other
    low-energy unoccupied.

-   Several unpaired spins in the multielectron quantum dot couple to
    total nonzero spin, e.g., spin 1 (Sec. 12.6 ).

#### 12.4 Spin 0

We first focus on the evidence that the even occupancies of the
multielectron dot, specifically @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , have a spin
0 ground state. (Here, @xmath indicates a specific, even, but unknown
number of electrons). The model for the multielectron dot introduced in
Sec. 12.3 suggests that, in this case, the ground state is described by
a configuration where all single-particle states below the Fermi energy
are occupied by singlet pairs of electrons [Fig. 12.2 and 12.3 (a)] and
form an effective vacuum state, provided that the spin correlation term
is smaller than the level spacing between the ground and the first
excited state. We therefore expect that the double dot will interact
with the multielectron dot as if it were an unoccupied dot, and the spin
of an electron tunneling into the multielectron dot would not change in
the process. In this sense, the double dot coupled to the multielectron
dot with this even occupancy should be qualitatively similar to a
two-electron triple-dot.

We describe this situation using a phenomenological model based on the
Hamiltonian for the multielectron dot detailed in Sec. 12.3 and add
terms describing the neighboring tunnel-coupled two-electron double
quantum dot. Then, for spinless even-occupancy ground states we neglect
the electron pairs singlet-paired on the orbitals below the Fermi
energy. We also neglect all but the lowest unoccupied orbital, and
finally we arrive at a Hubbard model of the three dots, each having a
single orbital, labeled @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (12.2)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

As illustrated in Fig. 12.2 the first term describes the gate-tunable
chemical potential of the left @xmath , middle @xmath and the right
multielectron @xmath dot. Second term describes the quantum dots
charging energy and the third, capacitative coupling between the dots.
The second and final lines incorporate the tunnel coupling @xmath within
a double dot and the tunnel coupling @xmath between the middle and right
multielectron dot.

This effective Hamiltonian can be solved in the 2-electron configuration
to yield a qualitative energy level diagram for the coupled system; a
representative plot is shown in Fig. 12.3 (b). Recall that the
“unoccupied” state of the multielectron dot is describing the effective
“vacuum” state with @xmath electrons in a spin-0 configuration. We find
that, in the (2,0, @xmath ) charge state, the singlet and triplet states
of the two-electron double dot are split by the exchange energy. In the
(1,1, @xmath ) state, the exchange splitting gradually decreases as the
overlap of the electronic wavefunctions decreases. Finally, in the (1,0,
@xmath ) configuration, the exchange splitting reduces to zero, as the
two electrons occupy distant dots.

In Fig. 12.3 (c) we map the exchange profile in these three regimes by
means of leakage spectroscopy (an analogue of the “spin funnel”
measurement of a double quantum dot [ 7 , 14 ] ). In this measurement we
prepare the double dot in a singlet state @xmath , and then pulse to the
various interaction points @xmath along the @xmath and @xmath axis for
an interaction time of 150 ns. The decrease of singlet return
probability measurement indicates leakage from the singlet state. We
repeat this procedure for various values of the in-plane magnetic field
@xmath up to 200 mT. The result of such a measurement, for the
multielectron dot occupancy of @xmath is presented in Fig. 12.3 (c). The
observed line feature (white triangle) indicates the crossing of the
singlet state @xmath and the fully polarized triplet state @xmath . This
line diverges to the high field in the (2,0, @xmath ) configuration,
indicating that the exchange interaction between the two electrons
within the DD is very strong. The line gradually moves towards @xmath in
the (1,1,2) configuration indicating a decrease of the exchange
interaction strength. Finally, it converges to zero field in the (1,0,
@xmath ) configuration when the two electrons are far separated. In this
configuration we observe an increased triplet return probability,
independent on the magnetic field. This increase is due to mixing of
singlet @xmath and unpolarized triplet @xmath states the Overhauser
field gradient between the left and the multielectron dot. The
measurement yields very similar features in cases of @xmath and @xmath
multielectron dot occupancy, as presented in Fig. 12.4 .

We can reconstruct the qualitative features of the leakage spectrum
using our microscopic model of the system. Using the spectrum obtained
from the Hamiltonian of Eq. 12.2 with the addition of Zeeman energy due
to an external perpendicular magnetic field @xmath , allows us to
reproduce the expected leakage spectroscopy behaviour, as shown in Fig.
12.3 (d). We identify the ground state associated with preparation of
the double dot in the singlet state, and then select the locus of points
as a function of detuning @xmath and in-plane magnetic field @xmath
where this singlet intersects with the fully polarized state @xmath .

To confirm the origin of the increased triplet outcome probability for
(1,0, @xmath ) configuration, we perform a time-resolved measurement of
the Overhauser field gradient [ 82 , 45 , 75 , 112 , 93 , 96 ] between
the leftmost dot and the multielectron dot. For that purpose we fix the
interaction point in the (1,0, @xmath ) charge configuration and
cyclically vary the waiting time @xmath from 0 to 100 ns. The cycle is
run continuously and a result of single shot readout at the end of each
pulse is recorded. A time trace showing 30 s reveals coherent
oscillations between the singlet @xmath and triplet @xmath states [Fig.
12.3 (e)]. The oscillation frequency varies on a timescale of seconds
and within a range of tens of megahertz, consistent with the dynamics of
the GaAs nuclear spin bath [ 95 , 82 , 96 , 93 ] .

#### 12.5 Spin 1/2

When the multielectron dot has odd occupancy, the ground state is
spin-1/2 and the resulting coupled system is much more complex than the
previous spin-0 case. As a reference, we begin this section by first
presenting the set of results for a three-electron triple quantum dot
(tuned in the same device). Having described the relevant physics of
this coupled system, we present two scenarios observed in our
experiments that result from replacing a single-electron quantum dot by
a odd-occupied multi-electron quantum dot. This investigation involves a
detailed study of the two distinct profiles of the exchange interaction
together with their interpretation within a microscopic model that
predicts two other possible profiles.

##### 12.5.1 Three-electron triple quantum dot

The description of the three-electron triple quantum dot [Fig. 12.5 (a)]
requires understanding the spectrum of the possible spin states. The
spectrum at the transition between the (2,0,1), (1,1,1) and (1,0,2)
charge states for finite magnetic field is presented in the energy
diagram [ 48 , 88 , 52 , 181 ] in Fig. 12.5 (b). In the leftmost part,
in the vicinity of the (2,0,1)-(1,1,1) charge transition, only the
exchange energy @xmath between left and the middle dot is significant,
while the exchange energy @xmath between middle and the right quantum
dot can be neglected. Therefore, near this charge transition, the
eigenstates are approximated by a tensor product of the two-electron
spin states of the left double quantum dot @xmath , @xmath (where @xmath
) together with a state of the right single-electron quantum dot @xmath
or @xmath . These states will be Zeeman-split, according to the
projection of the total spin on the external magnetic field direction.
Moreover the two singlet-like states @xmath and @xmath will have lower
energy than the triplet-like states @xmath and @xmath due to the
exchange interaction.

Conversely, in the vicinity of the (1,1,1)-(1,0,2) charge transition,
@xmath is negligible while @xmath is significant. In this region, the
eigenstates are approximated by tensor products of the left dot spin
states @xmath or @xmath and the two-electron spin states of the right
double quantum dot @xmath or @xmath . In the middle region with (1,1,1)
charge occupancy, the eigenstates continuously vary between these two
limiting cases. Their exact structure is not relevant for the analysis
presented here. However the important observation is that simultaneous
presence of the exchange @xmath and @xmath lifts all degeneracies.

The splitting between the lower singlet-like state and the triplet-like
state with the total spin @xmath [red colored lines in Fig. 12.5 (b)]
can be mapped out using leakage spectroscopy [ 181 ] [Fig. 12.5 (c)]
with a procedure similar to the one described in Sec. 12.4 . In this
case the system is prepared in the @xmath state, while the line feature
indicates leakage from the singlet-like state to the fully polarized
@xmath state [white and black triangles in Fig. 12.5 (b),(c)]. We
observe that the line diverges to high magnetic field for large positive
and negative values of @xmath , consistent with the decrease of the
energy of the singlet-like state @xmath or @xmath in the (2,0,1) or
(1,0,2) electron configuration, respectively.

Moreover, in this leakage spectroscopy experiment, we observe that the
background probability of the singlet return @xmath , which is
independent of the magnetic field, decreases with increasing value of
@xmath . This indicates that the eigenstates on the left side ( @xmath )
differ from the right side ( @xmath ) of the spectrum. In fact,
preparing the three-electron system in the @xmath state and interacting
it on the right side ( @xmath ) leads to coherent exchange oscillations
[ 48 , 50 ] . These kind of oscillations are presented in Fig. 12.5 (d),
in which the interaction time @xmath is varied on the few-nanosecond
timescale. Additionally, the frequency of the oscillations becomes
faster for larger values of @xmath which reflects the increase of the
exchange interaction @xmath between the middle and the right quantum
dot.

This precession can be exploited for the operation of the exchange-only
qubit [ 48 , 50 , 51 ] . Based on this description of the three-electron
triple dot behavior as a reference, in the following sections we will
present the results of the leakage spectroscopy and exchange
oscillations measurements performed on the system consisting of the
two-electron double quantum dot coupled to the third multielectron dot
with an odd-occupancy spin-1/2 ground state.

##### 12.5.2 Case study: Negative exchange interaction at the charge
transition

Now we focus on the two odd occupancies of the multielectron quantum
dot, @xmath and @xmath . In these cases the multielectron quantum dot
has a single unpaired spin on the highest occupied orbital, while
remaining electrons are paired up in singlets, forming the effective
vacuum state [Fig. 12.6 and 12.7 (a)].

We first perform a leakage spectroscopy measurement for the
multielectron quantum dot in @xmath occupancy [Fig. 12.7 (c)]. The left
part of the Fig. 12.7 (c), corresponds to the configuration in which the
multielectron quantum dot is not significantly exchange coupled to the
double quantum dot (i.e. @xmath ). Indeed, here we observe the line that
corresponds to the crossing between the states @xmath and @xmath . (The
state of the multielectron quantum dot is irrelevant in this regime, and
we label it to be @xmath , anticipating the following analysis.)

For the intermediate values of the @xmath we observe that the line
features form a very different pattern than in case of the three
electron triple quantum dot (Subsection. 12.5.1 ). The line indicating,
so far, the position of the crossing between @xmath and @xmath [white
triangle in Fig. 12.7 (c)] states converges to @xmath . Meanwhile, a
second line emerges and shifts towards larger values of the external
magnetic field @xmath (grey square). For more positive values of @xmath
, which correspond to (1,0, @xmath ) occupancy, we observe that the
newly appeared line does not diverge to large magnetic field. Instead,
it returns towards @xmath (green circle). At the point where the line
reaches @xmath we observe two new lines. The position of one of these
new lines is virtually independent on @xmath (pink diamond) while
another diverges to large magnetic field for increasing values of @xmath
(black triangle).

To explain this peculiar behavior, we introduce a modification of the
simple microscopic model of Eq. 12.2 that we used to describe the
even-occupancy spin-0 case. We now consider the gate voltage of the
multielectron quantum dot to be tuned such that the ground state is
odd-occupied, and is effectively described by a single unpaired spin
with a low energy orbital above an effective vacuum state of paired
singlets. Generalizing beyond Eq. 12.2 , we include two orbitals of the
multielectron quantum dot, indicated with subscript @xmath and @xmath ,
and the spin correlation term @xmath of Eq. 12.1 . The Hamiltonian of
the system (illustrated in Fig. 12.6 ) is given by

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (12.3)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

The first term of this equation is the diagonal in terms of the spin
occupancy numbers and captures both the charging and Coulomb energies of
the dots. The second term, proportional to @xmath , captures the spin
correlation energy: it is a term that favors a @xmath triplet
configuration when both levels @xmath and @xmath are occupied. The
remaining terms proportional to @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath describes
tunnel coupling within the double quantum dot, between the middle dot
@xmath and @xmath , and between @xmath and @xmath , respectively.

In Fig. 12.7 (b) we present the energy diagram of the double quantum dot
coupled to spin-1/2 multielectron quantum dot obtained from the
3-electron spectrum of Eq. 12.3 , using @xmath and @xmath (see
discussion in subsection 12.5.5 ). The left part, for which @xmath
matches exactly the three-electron triple quantum dot case [Fig. 12.5
(b)], and the line feature corresponds to the crossing between @xmath
and @xmath states (white triangle). In contrast, for the intermediate
values of @xmath the singlet-like state @xmath continuously changes into
triplet-like state @xmath . The change from triplet-like to singlet-like
character is a cause for the convergence of the line feature to @xmath .
Simultaneously the triplet-like state @xmath shifts towards higher
energies and continuously changes into @xmath . The crossing between
this state and the states with the total spin projection @xmath on the
direction of the external magnetic field results in the emergence of the
new line in Fig. 12.7 (c) (grey square). This interpretation leads to
the conclusion that for intermediate values of @xmath a triplet
configuration consisting of the single electron spin and the spin 1/2 in
the multielectron quantum dot has lower energy than the singlet.

For larger values of @xmath , the energy of the singlet-like @xmath
state decreases and ultimately becomes lower than the energy of the
triplet-like state. This implies that the ground state of the
multielectron quantum dot in @xmath occupancy has spin 0, consistent
with the evidence presented in Sec. 12.4 . The value of @xmath for which
the singlet-like and triplet-like states are degenerate corresponds to
the crossing of the three line features at @xmath [Fig. 12.7 (c)].
Specifically, the three lines correspond to the crossings of @xmath with
triplet-like states of different spin projections @xmath on the
direction of the external magnetic field. The left, middle and the right
line correspond to crossing with states having, respectively, @xmath and
@xmath , as indicated by gray sqaure, green circle and pink diamond in
Fig. 12.7 (b),(c).

An identical analysis of the leakage spectroscopy measurements for the
@xmath occupancy of the multielectron quantum [Fig. 12.8 (a)] dot yields
the same conclusion. In particular it indicates that the ground state of
the @xmath occupancy should have spin 0, in agreement with the evidence
presented in Sec. 12.4 .

Our microscopic model also allows us to reconstruct the leakage
spectrum, as described in Sec. 12.4 . Our reconstruction, which
qualitatively reproduces all of the essential features of the leakage
spectroscopy measurement, is shown in Fig. 12.7 (e).

This interpretation of the energy diagram from the leakage spectroscopy
measurements implies that the exchange interaction strength reaches an
extremal value as a function of @xmath . This extremum in exchange
energy should result in a maximum in the exchange oscillations
frequency. In Figs. 12.7 (d) and 12.8 (b) we present the time-resolved
measurement of the exchange oscillations for, respectively, @xmath and
@xmath occupancy of the multielectron dot. The exchange energy extracted
from the leakage spectroscopy pattern for @xmath occupancy is presented
in Fig. 12.7 (f). We observe the maximum in the oscillations frequency
for the value of @xmath that matches exactly the extreme position of the
line features in the leakage spectroscopy measurement [Figs. 12.7 (c)
and 12.8 (a)]. This behavior confirms that the exchange interaction
strength has an extremum, and that it changes sign at the charge
transition; however these measurements do not yield information about
the sign of the exchange interaction strength. In principle that
information could be obtained from the dependence of the oscillations
visibility on @xmath , but the visibility can be affected by the finite
waveform rise time and readout infidelity, therefore we restrain
ourselves from such analysis.

To summarize, for @xmath and @xmath occupancies of the multielectron
quantum dot we observe a negative exchange interaction (i.e.,
triplet-preferring) with the single electron as long as the electron
resides at the neighboring dot, i.e. in the charge configurations (1,1,
@xmath ) or (1,1, @xmath ). The exchange interaction then becomes
positive (i.e. singlet-preferring) when the electron is transferred onto
the multielectron quantum dot, i.e. in (1,0, @xmath ) or (1,0, @xmath )
electron configuration, leading to the formation of the spin 0 ground
state for the even occupancy of the multielectron quantum dot.

##### 12.5.3 Case study: Negative exchange in the multielectron dot

Next we focus on is @xmath multielectron dot occupancy. Similarly to the
occupancies @xmath and @xmath (Subsection 12.5.2 ) in this case there is
a single unpaired electron on the highest occupied orbital of the
multielectron dot [Fig. 12.9 (a)]. However, the leakage spectroscopy
measurement [Fig. 12.9 (c)] implies that the exchange interaction with
the single neighboring electron is qualitatively different.

In contrast to the previous cases, the line indicating the crossing
between singlet-like state @xmath and the fully polarized @xmath (white
triangle) state does not converge to @xmath . Instead, the line feature
reverses to high magnetic fields for intermediate values of @xmath ,
i.e., in (1,1, @xmath ) charge state (grey square). This behavior
indicates that as long as the single electron resides on the neighboring
dot the singlet-like state @xmath has lower energy than the triplet-like
states. Nevertheless, beyond at the transition to (1,0, @xmath ) the
line feature does come back to @xmath , and the set of the three lines
appear as well.

The energy diagram corresponding to this case is presented in Fig. 12.9
(b). Indeed, using @xmath and @xmath we obtain an energy diagram
revealing the positive (singlet-preferring) exchange interaction in
(1,1, @xmath ) electron configuration and negative (triplet-preferring)
in (1,0, @xmath ) configuration. In this energy diagram we can identify
all crossings corresponding to the line features in Fig. 12.9 (c). In
particular the three lines correspond to the crossings between @xmath
and the triplet-like states having, respectively, @xmath (left line,
pink diamond), @xmath (middle, green circle) and @xmath (right, grey
rectangle).

Following the logic from Subsection 12.5.2 we come to the conclusion
that the ground state of the @xmath occupancy multielectron dot must
have a spin 1. Indeed, in Sec. 12.6 we present the evidence for the
exchange interaction between @xmath occupancy multielectron quantum dot
and the neighboring spin, consistent with a spin-1 ground state.

In Fig. 12.9 (d) we present the time resolved exchange oscillations
measurement. Similarly to the @xmath and @xmath occupancies we find the
that the oscillations reach locally the maximum frequency for the value
of @xmath that correspond to the extreme position of the line feature in
the leakage spectroscopy measurement. Additionally we observe the
emergence of the line for the value of @xmath that results in the
degeneracy between @xmath and @xmath states.

More extensive study of the charge occupancy @xmath , presented in this
subsection, including tunability of the exchange profile, is a topic of
Ref. [ 169 ] (Ch. 13 ).

##### 12.5.4 Extreme occupancies of the multielectron quantum dot @xmath
and @xmath

We now present the results of the leakage spectroscopy and exchange
oscillation measurements for the @xmath and @xmath occupancies of the
multielectron dot charge. These are the most extreme studied
occupancies, which is linked to the limited tunability of the tunnel
coupling between the middle and multielectron dot. As a result, the data
provides consistent evidence for the presence of a spin on the
multielectron quantum dot but the quality is not sufficient to perform
the full analysis analogous to Subsections 12.5.2 and 12.5.3 .

In Fig. 12.11 (a) we show the leakage spectroscopy for @xmath occupancy
of the multielectron quantum dot. Initially the line feature converges
towards zero, indicating the decrease of the exchange interaction within
the two-electron double quantum dot. However, at @xmath mV it appears to
split. Beyond the apparent splitting, one of the lines converges
completely to @xmath while the second one diverges. Finally, we suspect
that the diverging line returns and crosses zero at about @xmath mV.
This suggests that one of the two possible scenarios takes place: either
the exchange interaction strength between the single electron and the
spin-1/2 multielectron dot has a negative sign for small wavefunction
overlap (in the (1,1, @xmath ) charge configuration) and positive for
large wavefunction overlap (in (1,0, @xmath ) occupancy), or else the
opposite behavior is the case. The observation of the spin-0 ground
state for @xmath occupancy supports the first hypothesis.

Notably, the exchange oscillations presented in Fig. 12.11 (b) do not
reveal a local maximum in the oscillations frequency. This indicates
there is no extremum in the exchange interaction strength, which
contradicts our hypothesis that the line feature crosses @xmath in Fig.
12.11 (a). Regardless, the presence of the exchange oscillations is
evidence that the @xmath occupancy multielectron quantum dot has a
spinful ground state.

The leakage spectroscopy performed for the other extreme occupancy,
@xmath , presented in Fig. 12.11 (a), reveals the pattern characteristic
for the three-electron triple quantum dot (Subsection 12.5.1 ). This
suggests that the multielectron quantum dot with this occupancy behaves
as an ordinary spin-1/2 with no remarkable phenomena occurring at the
@xmath to @xmath charge transition. However we can not fully exclude the
possibility that the exchange interaction changes sign, which may be
hard to detect when the tunnel coupling is too large [ 169 ] . In
addition, the exchange oscillations pattern does not allow us to make a
definite statement about the presence of the extremum in the exchange
interaction strength due to increased dephasing at the strongly
pinched-off interdot charge transition [ 12 ] [Fig. 12.11 (b)].

##### 12.5.5 The classification of the observed spin-1/2 ground state
characteristics within a Hubbard model

The effective exchange coupling depends on many free parameters in our
phenomenological model, but we find that its general behaviour falls
into four main regimes as shown schematically in Fig. 12.12 . We analyse
these regimes of the spectrum in terms of two dimensionless quantities.
The first is @xmath , which we note can be positive or negative. When
positive, i.e., @xmath , the energy separation of the two relevant
single-particle levels 1 and 2 in the multielectron dot is larger than
the spin correlation energy, and the doubly-occupied multielectron dot
will ultimately favour a singlet configuration energetically once
detuning has crossed the charge transition point. When this quantity is
negative, i.e., @xmath , the spin correlation energy is larger than the
splitting, and a double-occupied triplet configuration is energetically
preferred past the charge transition. Thus, the parameter @xmath will
determine the spin state of the multielectron dot (singlet or triplet)
when detuning into the multielectron dot is very large.

The other parameter we use to describe the spectrum is the ratio @xmath
. When @xmath , tunnel coupling from the middle dot to the lower level
of the multielectron dot is dominant, whereas @xmath describes a
situation where the tunnelling to the higher level of the multielectron
dot is stronger. The regime @xmath results in an exchange interaction
that favours a triplet configuration in the multielectron dot for small
detuning, and @xmath favours a singlet configuration.

As a function of these two dimensionless quantities, we obtain the four
regimes shown in Fig. 12.12 . In regime I, the behaviour is
qualitatively the same as for a triple quantum dot; the higher level in
the multielectron quantum dot is largely uninvolved. In regime II, the
stronger coupling to the second level of the multielectron dot means
that a triplet configuration is preferred for small detuning, but
becomes singlet-preferring as the detuning is increased past the charge
transition. In such a regime, we expect exchange coupling to be negative
for small detuning, and then change sign and become positive for large
detuning, as seen with the @xmath and @xmath occupancies. Regime III is
the opposite; the coupling to the lower level of the multielectron dot
dominates, preferring a singlet configuration for small detuning, but
for larger detuning the spin correlation energy is dominant and favours
a triplet configuration. This regime is represented by the @xmath
occupancy, where exchange coupling is negative past the charge
transition into the multielectron dot. Finally, in Regime IV, the
dominant coupling to the higher level of the jellybean together with the
strong spin correlation energy ensures that a triplet configuration is
energetically preferred throughout.

#### 12.6 Spin 1

Our final case concerns the @xmath multielectron quantum dot occupancy.
Our study of the @xmath occupancy (Subsection 12.5.3 ) suggests that the
addition of an electron to the spin-1/2 ground state results in the
triplet configuration having lower energy than the singlet. This implies
that the ground state of the multielectron dot with @xmath occupancy
should have spin 1 [Fig. 12.13 (a)].

Indeed, in the leakage spectroscopy measurement [Fig. 12.13 (c)] we
observe a pattern that is more similar to the three-electron triple
quantum dot case [Fig. 12.5 (c)] than to other even occupancies [Figs.
12.3 (c) and 12.4 ]. It is an unambiguous evidence for presence of the
non-zero spin in the multielectron quantum dot, spin 1 in this case. We
note that the line feature diverges to large @xmath for increasing
@xmath indicating the positive sign of the exchange interaction, i.e.
preferring the low-spin state. Also the measurement of the exchange
oscillations shows the presence of the exchange interaction [Fig. 12.13
(d)]. These observations lead us to the following conclusions. First,
the multielectron dot in @xmath occupancy carries a spin. Second, the
exchange interaction with the neighboring spin has a positive sign, and
therefore the addition of the electron will lead to reduction of the
ground state spin.

We can relate all the observed features to the schematic energy diagram
presenting spin states of the two-electron double quantum dot coupled to
spin-1. In the left side of the diagram spin-1 is decoupled from the
double quantum dot and the eigenstates are the tensor product of double
dot states and spin-1 states with different spin projections on the
direction of the magnetic field @xmath . The three double-dot
singlet-like states correspond in the diagram to the three lines
diverging towards small energies.

On the contrary, in the right side, the eigenstates are the tensor
product of spin-1/2 states and strongly coupled spin-1/2 and spin-1.
Among the latter six states there are four quadruplet states @xmath ,
@xmath with a total spin 3/2, and two dublet states @xmath with the
total spin of 1/2 (the subscript indicates the spin projection on the
magnetic field direction). Due to positive exchange interaction the
dublet states diverge towards small energy.

We conjecture that in the experiment we initialize the triple dot in the
@xmath state (similarly to @xmath for spin-1/2 multielectron dot). As we
change detuning this eigenstate continuously changes into @xmath [bottom
red line in Fig. 12.13 (b)] which results in the exchange oscillations
in Fig. 12.13 (c). Meanwhile, the line features in the leakage
spectroscopy correspond to the crossing of this red-coloured state with
a fully polarized @xmath state [black and white triangles in Fig. 12.13
(b),(c)].

Finally, we present an outcome of the leakage spectroscopy measurement
in the out-of-plane magnetic field @xmath [Fig. 12.13 (e)]. Curiously,
in this case we observe an additional line (pointed by the black arrow).
At the boundary between @xmath and @xmath the line indicating DD @xmath
- @xmath crossing and the new line do seem not to interact with each
other. On the other hand, at the transition between @xmath and @xmath
the conventional line ends at the crossing point. We speculate that the
additional line appears because the multielectron-dot orbitals are
strongly affected by the out-of-plane magnetic field, which leads to the
change of the ground state spin from 1 ( @xmath mT) to 0 ( @xmath mT).
Indeed, this would explain lack of interaction between the lines in
regime where the double quantum dot is essentially decoupled from the
multielectron dot. Moreover, this is consistent with a disappearance of
the line at @xmath mV, since we know that this feature is not present
when the multielectron quantum dot has a spin-0 ground state case (Sec.
12.4 ).

#### 12.7 Summary and outlook

To summarize, we apply the methods developed for spin qubit manipulation
to study a mesoscopic, multielectron quantum dot. This enables us to
detect the electron parity of the dot and study in detail the
interaction with the single neighboring electron. We discover a
counterintuitive exchange profile between a single electron and an
odd-occupied multielectron quantum dot and observe that the exchange
interaction rapidly varies. In particular the exchange interaction
changes sign as a result of a few-milivolt change of gate voltages. We
also explain this observation using simple Hubbard model and classify
possible exchange profiles.

The most important conclusion of this work that can be readily exploited
is that the multielectron quantum dot is perfectly suitable as a
mediator of the exchange interaction. Indeed we demonstrate that in the
follow up experiment [ 163 ] . However several other findings may find
application in spin qubits as well. First, at the position of the
discovered extrema in the exchange profile, the exchange oscillations
have reduced sensitivity to charge noise [ 64 , 68 ] , which can be used
to increase the gates fidelity. Second, access to both signs of the
exchange lifts constraint on the dynamically decoupled gates [ 182 , 183
] . Third, since the large quantum dot is characterized by reduced level
spacing, it may be possible to exploit charge-noise insensitive
singlet-triplet splitting in the regime where the two electrons occupy
the multielectron quantum dot, in a manner analogous to the quantum dot
hybrid qubit [ 58 , 60 ] . Finally, larger size of the multielectron
quantum dot implies reduction of the Overhauser field experienced by the
electrons, since its wavefunction overlaps with larger number of nuclei,
and therefore reduced dephasing [ 109 ] .

Nevertheless, several questions concerning the multielectron quantum
dots remain unanswered. First of all, the distribution of the level
spacings and the strength of the spin correlation energy were not
studied here. In particular the dependence of these two characteristics
on the dot size is of both fundamental and practical importance. Another
curiosity is that for all three spin-1/2 ground states, for which we
performed the full analysis, we observe the extrema in the exchange
strength even though they are characterized by different sign of the
exchange strength. This may be a hint of the correlation between the
level spacing and the ratio of the tunnel couplings.

Finally, for the first time we perform the leakage spectroscopy and
exchange oscillations measurement to study the spectrum of a not
understood object. We propose that the same principle could be applied
to study numerous other systems. Several examples are quantum dot
coupled to the quantum hall or fractional quantum hall edge states [ 184
, 185 ] , or to the hybrid super-semiconducting quantum dot such as
Majorana islands [ 186 , 187 ] . Even more brave generalization of this
technique could involve study of the exchange interaction between a
quantum dot located at the tip of the scanning probe and any surface
structure.

[width=0.8breakable, size=minimal, colback=white] By operating a
one-electron quantum dot (fabricated between a multielectron dot and a
one-electron reference dot) as a spectroscopic probe, we study the spin
properties of a gate-controlled multielectron GaAs quantum dot at the
transition between odd and even occupation number. We observe that the
multielectron groundstate transitions from spin-1/2-like to singlet-like
to triplet-like as we increase the detuning towards the next higher
charge state. The sign reversal in the inferred exchange energy is
robust and already occurs in the absence of an external magnetic field,
while the exchange strength is tunable by gate voltages and in-plane
magnetic fields. Complementing spin leakage spectroscopy data, the
inspection of coherent multielectron spin exchange oscillations provides
further evidence for the sign reversal and, inferentially, for the
importance of non-trivial multielectron spin exchange correlations.

#### 13.1 Introduction

Semiconducting quantum dots with individual unpaired electronic spins
offer a compact platform for quantum computation [ 69 , 71 ] . They
provide submicron-scale two-level systems that can be operated as qubits
[ 5 , 73 , 74 , 42 , 14 , 94 ] and coupled to each other via direct
exchange or direct capacitive interaction. In these approaches, the
essential role of nearest-neighbor interactions in larger and larger
arrays of one-electron quantum dots [ 37 , 21 , 22 , 188 , 40 ] poses
technological challenges to upscaling, due to the density of electrodes
that define and control these quantum circuits. This issue has
stimulated efforts to study long-range coupling of spin qubits either by
electrical dipole-dipole interaction [ 37 , 22 , 189 ] or via
superconducting microwave cavities [ 23 , 55 , 65 ] . However, these
approaches involve the charge degree of freedom, which makes the qubit
susceptible to electrical noise [ 190 , 109 , 12 , 64 ] . Recent work [
52 , 86 ] indicates that the effective noise needs to be reduced
significantly before long-range two-qubit gates with high fidelity can
be reached [ 55 , 191 ] . Alternatively, symmetric exchange pulses can
be implemented that perform fast, charge-insensitive gates [ 192 , 81 ,
64 , 68 ] . Even though the exchange interaction is intrinsically
short-ranged, its range can be increased by means of a quantum mediator
[ 193 , 194 ] . In particular, using a large multielectron quantum dot
as an exchange mediator has the potential to do both: provide fast spin
interaction [ 195 , 160 ] and alleviate spatial control line crowding.
To avoid entanglement with internal degrees of freedom of the mediator,
recent theory [ 195 , 160 ] motivates the use of a multielectron quantum
dot with a spinless ground state and a level spacing sufficiently large
to suppress unwanted excitations by gate voltage pulses.

In this Letter, we investigate a GaAs multielectron quantum dot and show
that its spin properties make it suitable for use as a coherent spin
mediator. The experiment involves a chain of three quantum dots that can
be detuned relative to each other using top-gate voltage pulses. The
central one-electron dot serves as a probe: its spin can be tunnel
coupled either to the left one-electron dot (serving as a reference spin
for initialization and readout), or to a large dot on the right, thereby
probing its multielectron spin states. We focus on a particular odd
occupancy of the multielectron dot, @xmath +1, characterized by an
effective spin 1/2, and establish that the exchange coupling between the
central probe spin and the multielectron spin depends strongly and
non-monotonically on the detuning of relevant gate voltages. Remarkably,
this exchange coupling becomes negative, i.e. triplet-preferring, as the
central electron is detuned further into the right dot. We therefore
infer a spin-1 ground state for @xmath +2 occupation, even in the
absence of an applied magnetic field. Besides fundamental implications
for the role of non-trivial interactions within a multielectron dot,
presented elsewhere for a large range of MED occupations [ 94 ] , our
finding has practical applications. For example, the nonmonotonicity of
the exchange profile results in a sweetspot, whereas its sign reversal
removes a long-standing constraint for the construction of compact
dynamically corrected exchange gates [ 182 , 183 ] .

#### 13.2 Sample

The three quantum dots were fabricated in a GaAs/Al @xmath Ga @xmath As
heterostructure hosting a two-dimensional electron gas with a bulk
density @xmath = @xmath m @xmath and a mobility @xmath = 230 m @xmath
/Vs, located 57 nm below the wafer surface. The confining potential and
dot occupancy is voltage-tuned by Ti/Au metallic gates deposited on a
10 nm thin HfO @xmath gate dielectric. Figure 13.1 (a) shows the two
accumulation gates (colored in green) surrounded by various depletion
gates, and a schematic cut through the resulting triple-well potential.
Gates labeled @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath (colored in red) are
connected to high-bandwidth coaxial lines and allow application of
nanosecond-scale voltage pulses. An adjacent quantum dot (not shown)
serves as a fast charge sensor, i.e. changes in its conductance change
the amplitude ( @xmath ) of a reflected rf carrier [ 83 ] . All
measurements were conducted in a dilution refrigerator with mixing
chamber temperature below 30 mK.

The device can be viewed as a two-electron double quantum dot (DQD)
tunnel-coupled to a multielectron dot (MED) with an estimated number of
electrons between 50 and 100, based on @xmath and the area of the
multielectron dot. By measuring @xmath as a function of voltages @xmath
, @xmath and @xmath we can map out the dots’ occupancies in the vicinity
of the charge states (2,0, @xmath +1), (1,1, @xmath +1) and (1,0, @xmath
+2). Here, the numbers correspond to electron occupation in the left
dot, central dot and the MED, respectively. The resulting charge diagram
in Fig. 13.1 (b) allows the definition of two detuning axes in
gate-voltage space, @xmath and @xmath , such that a reduction of @xmath
pushes the central electron into the left dot, whereas an increase in
@xmath pushes it to the MED (cf. arrows).

The MED spin states are probed by the pulse sequence illustrated in Fig.
13.1 (c,d). First, two electrons in a singlet state are prepared in the
left dot, by pulsing to the (2,0, @xmath +1) charge state. Then a @xmath
pulse to the (1,1, @xmath +1) state effectively turns off intra-DQD
exchange interactions while maintaining the two-electron spin state. The
next step probes the interaction between the central electron and the
MED in the vicinity of the charge transition between (1,1, @xmath +1)
and (1,0, @xmath +2). This is done by pulsing @xmath , i.e. by
temporarily applying a negative voltage pulse to @xmath and a positive
voltage pulse to @xmath . After an interaction time @xmath we return to
(1,1, @xmath +1) and immediately reduce @xmath for single-shot
reflectometry readout [ 82 ] : If @xmath indicates a (2,0, @xmath +1)
charge state, we assign a singlet outcome, whereas (1,1, @xmath +1)
indicates that a spin interaction with the MED has occured, and we count
it as a non-singlet outcome. The fraction of singlet outcomes when
repeating typically 1024 identical pulse sequences is denoted by @xmath
.

#### 13.3 Leakage spectroscopy and exchange oscillations

Leakage spectroscopy is performed by choosing @xmath sufficiently long
to detect incoherent spin mixing between the central electron and MED
states. Figure 13.2 (a) shows @xmath , where @xmath is the detuning
voltage during the interaction step and @xmath is the applied in-plane
magnetic field. To make connection to the conventional two-electron DQD
regime we also plot @xmath , acquired by replacing the composite @xmath
- @xmath pulse in Fig. 13.1 (d) by a pure @xmath pulse. Spin leakage is
clearly observed as a sharp suppression of @xmath for particular
detuning values, with a non-trivial magnetic field dependence for @xmath
mV. To understand this spectrum we note that all features below @xmath
mV are well explained by mixing with fully polarized spin states,
consistent with previous spin leakage experiments: The @xmath dependence
(“spin funnel”) is analogous to mixing between singlet and @xmath in
two-electron DQDs [ 7 , 14 , 21 ] , whereas the @xmath dependence is
analogues to mixing between a singlet-like state and @xmath in
three-electron triple quantum dots [ 52 , 50 ] . (Here, each arrow
indicates the spin state within one quantum dot.) The characteristic
dependence on @xmath arises from the linear Zeeman shift of fully
polarized spin states [ 48 , 49 ] .

This identification confirms odd multielectron occupation, i.e. (1,1,
@xmath +1), with effective spin 1/2. It also allows us to extract the
exchange interaction ( @xmath ) between the central spin and the
effective MED spin from the ordinate of the leakage feature (black dot),
using @xmath , where @xmath is the electronic @xmath -factor for GaAs
and @xmath is the Bohr magneton. Towards higher detuning, @xmath mV, an
overall drop in the background of @xmath indicates that the MED ground
state transitions into (1,0, @xmath +2), approximately concurrent with
the sharp leakage feature (black dot) reaching a maximum before turning
towards @xmath (blue triangle). At @xmath two additonal leakage features
appear at @xmath . We interpret this maximum as a maximum in in the
exchange profile, @xmath , and associate the crossing at @xmath with a
sign reversal of @xmath .

To infer the spin spectrum, we impose the observed exchange profile
@xmath on a Heisenberg model of three spin-1/2 orbitals ¹ ¹ 1 The
specific detuning dependence of @xmath within a Hubbard model is
explained in Ref. [ 196 ] (chapter 12 ), and remains phenomenological
within this Letter. . For simplicity we ignore orbital coupling to
@xmath and inspect spin Zeeman effects only. The resulting energy
diagram, sketched in Fig. 13.2 (b) for finite @xmath , allows us to
identify all characteristic leakage features. On the left side of the
energy diagram only intra-DQD exchange is significant ( @xmath ), and
the eigenstates are the tensor products of a DQD spin state and a MED
“spectator" spin. For example, the grey dot marks the crossing between
@xmath and @xmath , and relates the “spin funnel” in (a) to @xmath .
Analogously, on the right side of the energy diagram, the left dot is
decoupled and hosts the spectator spin, while the central spin interacts
with the effective MED spin. Here, field dependent crossings map out the
positive (black and blue marker) and negative (green marker) regime of
@xmath (cf. crossings of @xmath with @xmath , @xmath and @xmath ). At
these crossings rapid mixing due to uncontrolled Overhauser gradients is
expected to occur, changing electronic spin projections by 1 on a
timescale of @xmath ns [ 73 ] .

In contrast to three-electron triple dots [ 52 , 50 ] , where @xmath is
always positive, we observe that @xmath and @xmath cross each other at
@xmath . This implies that the exchange interaction between the single
and multielectron quantum dot changes sign from positive to negative,
i.e. it is singlet-preferring for small hybridization and becomes
triplet-preferring once the central electron has transferred to the
multielectron dot. Next, we test for robustness and gate-tunability of
this effect. In Fig. 13.2 (c) we plot @xmath extracted from Fig. 13.2
(a) (black symbols), and compare it to two exchange profiles (green and
blue symbols) measured by distorting the confining potential while
preserving the charge configuration of the triple dot system (cf. Fig.
13.6 ). In all cases @xmath shows the same behavior, namely a maximum
and sign reversal at the position of the charge transition, and a
negative sign in the (1,0, @xmath +2) configuration. This interpretation
implies that the @xmath +2 charge state of the multielectron dot has a
total spin of 1 at zero magnetic field, which is further confirmed by
studying the MED behavior over multiple charge states [ 94 ] .

Direct evidence for the sign reversal in @xmath (without the need for a
magnetic field) can be obtained from time-domain measurements. To this
end, we induce coherent exchange oscillations between central and MED
spin by significantly reducing (and varying) the interaction time @xmath
. The observed pattern of @xmath , shown in Fig. 13.3 (a) for the same
DC tuning parameters as in Fig. 13.2 (a), differ from analogous
oscillations of the exchange-only qubit [ 48 , 50 ] . Namely, the
appearance of a chevron-like pattern indicates the presence of a local
maximum in @xmath . Following contours of equal phase ( @xmath ) around
this “sweet spot”, we note that @xmath has opposite sign for large and
small @xmath , implying a sign reversal in @xmath . To show consistency
between time-domain and leakage spectroscopy results, we perform
numerical simulations of the exchange oscillations using the
experimentally measured exchange profile presented in Fig. 13.2 (c). The
simulation is limited to the Hilbert space spanned by @xmath and @xmath
(indicated with red in Fig. 13.2 (b)) and includes a quasistatic
Gaussian noise in @xmath with standard deviation @xmath = 0.18 mV [ 64 ,
84 ] and a rise time of our instrumentation of 0.8 ns. The simulation
reproduces a chevron pattern (Fig. 13.3 (b)), whereas simulations using
@xmath produce a qualitatively different pattern (not shown). Therefore,
the contour @xmath does indeed separate regions with @xmath from regions
with @xmath .

#### 13.4 Effect of orbital field

Finally, we study the effects of applied magnetic fields on the exchange
profile. Figure 13.4 (a) presents @xmath as a function of @xmath and
out-of-plane magnetic field @xmath , while keeping @xmath = 0 and @xmath
= 3.33 ns fixed. In such a plot, contours correspond to constant @xmath
in the @xmath - @xmath plane, and their curvature indicates that
out-of-plane magnetic fields move the sign reversal of @xmath towards
higher detuning (cf. @xmath contour, marked by a dashed line). For
comparison, within the same range, @xmath has no observable influence on
the pattern of the exchange oscillations (Fig. 13.4 (b)). By choosing
@xmath longer than the coherence time we obtain the @xmath -dependence
of the leakage spectrum (Fig. 13.4 (c), using @xmath = 150 ns). The two
leakage features appearing for negative values of @xmath correspond to
mixing between @xmath and the fully polarized @xmath . The leakage
feature appearing for positive values of @xmath indicates @xmath and
resolves into three lines at higher fields (cf. Fig. 13.2 ).

Exchange profiles @xmath for @xmath = 0, 50, 85 and 120 mT were
extracted from @xmath maps obtained for the same tuning voltages as in
Fig. 13.4 (a) (Fig. 13.6 ). Their @xmath -dependence shown in Fig. 13.4
(d) corroborates again the sensitivity of the exchange profile to the
underlying electronic orbitals, and establishes an electrical sweet spot
in @xmath that can be precisely tuned by @xmath .

#### 13.5 Conclusion

In summary, we have investigated experimentally the exchange interaction
between a two-electron double quantum dot and a multielectron quantum
dot, by complementing incoherent spin leakage measurements with
time-resolved coherent exchange oscillations at various tuning voltages
and magnetic field configurations. We find that the multielectron dot
with odd occupation number behaves as a spin-1/2 object that gives rise
to a non-monotonic exchange coupling to the neighboring dot. By changing
the relative dot detuning voltage by a few millivolt the sign of the
exchange interaction can be tuned from positive to negative (also at
zero magnetic field), indicating the presence of non-trivial
electron-electron interactions. Finally, we show that the exchange
profile can be tuned by either changing the gate potentials or applying
an out-of-plane orbital magnetic field, giving rise to a tunable
electrical sweet spot that might benefit the implementation of
high-fidelity exchange gates [ 64 , 68 ] in long-distance quantum

#### 13.6 Supplement: Extracting @xmath from exchange oscillations

Exchange profiles @xmath plotted in Fig. 13.4 (d) in the main text were
obtained from Fig. 13.3 (a) and Figs. 13.2 (a-c) for @xmath = 0, 50, 85
and 120 mT, respectively. For each value of @xmath , the frequency of
the exchange oscillations @xmath is obtained in two steps. First, we
calculate the Fast Fourier transform of @xmath and find the frequency
bin with the largest weight. Then we use this frequency as an initial
guess for fitting a damped sine wave of frequency @xmath to @xmath ,
with a decaying amplitude of the form exp @xmath . Values of @xmath
extrated by this method are plotted as circles in Fig. 13.3 (d).

#### 14.1 Introduction

In a scalable quantum processor, the coupling used to perform two-qubit
gates must have fulfill three key requirements: it should be fast,
coherent and long-range. Indeed, the presence of such coupling underlies
the success of the superconducting [ 197 , 198 ] and trapped-ion qubits
[ 199 ] . The spin qubit community is also focused on finding such
coupling scheme. However approaches based on superconducting qubits
designs [ 200 , 159 ] , i.e. capacitative coupling [ 37 , 22 ] and
cavity-mediated interaction [ 23 , 24 ] , tend to be troublesome. That
is because they involve a charge degree of freedom [ 154 , 156 ] , while
spin qubits lack the charge-noise protection [ 109 , 12 ] inherent to
transmons [ 201 ] . Alternatively, exchange coupling can be introduced
in a charge-noise insensitive manner [ 64 , 68 ] . Moreover, the
intrinsically short range of the exchange interaction can be extended by
means of a quantum mediator [ 162 , 161 , 160 ] . Here we show that a
multielectron quantum dot works extraordinarily well as such mediator [
160 ] . We show that the exchange interaction mediated by a
multielectron quantum dot can be controlled up to a few-gigahertz
regime. Moreover, many-body effects present in the multielectron quantum
dot give rise to the emergence of the extremum in the exchange
interaction strength characterized by low charge-noise sensitivity [ 169
, 196 ] . We conclude that the exchange interaction mediated by a
multielectron dot fulfills all requirements of the scalable coupling
mechanism and sketch a clear path for scaling the coherent quantum dot
systems.

#### 14.2 The device and concept of the experiment

We implement long-range exchange coupling mediated by a multielectron
quantum dot in a quintuple quantum dot array (Fig. 14.1 (a)). The
quantum dots are defined in a 57 nm deep GaAs two-dimensional electron
gas, covered by 10 nm Hf @xmath O insulating oxide layer, by means of
electrostatic gates deposited on top of the heterostructure. The middle
dot has an even number of electrons [ 196 ] , between 50 and 100 as
estimated from the lithographic size of the device and the density of
the 2-dimensional electron gas. The double quantum dots (DQDs) located
on both sides are tuned to a single-electron regime.

The exchange interaction is studied by means of a sequence
sub-microsecond voltage pulses applied to the blue-colored gates in Fig.
14.1 (a). The pulse sequence (Supplementary Section 15.1 ) realizes the
following procedure (Fig. 14.1 (b)). First, pairs of electron in the
DQDs are pushed to the outmost quantum dots, where they relax. This
initializes each of the DQDs in a spin singlet state @xmath where the
arrows indicate the spin state of the two electrons and subscript @xmath
indicates left and right DQD. Than, the electrons are rapidly separated,
so that each of the small dots is occupied by a single electron. This
pulse turns off the exchange interaction between electrons within each
DQD. In the third stage the positive voltage pulses on gate @xmath and
negative on all other gates induces the exchange between the electrons
located on the inner pair of small dots (to which we will refer as
“inner dots”). The induced exchange interaction causes flip-flops
between those electronic spins. This leads to the correlated decrease of
probability that electron pairs in both DQDs are in a singlet state.
After the interaction time @xmath the exchange-inducing pulse is
switched-off. Finally, we employ the spin-to-charge conversion [ 202 ]
to readout the relative spin of the electron pairs in each DQD. The
reflectometry readout of the two nearby quantum-dot-based charge sensors
[ 9 ] allows us to distinguish between singlet and triplet states within
each DQD independently and with single-shot fidelity.

#### 14.3 Evidence for the exchange coupling

The result of such pulse sequence is shown in Fig. 14.2 (a). In the two
panels, we plot the singlet return probability @xmath of each DQD as a
function of duration @xmath and voltage of the pulse amplitude
(Supplementary Section 15.1 ). These oscillations are the result of the
exchange-driven flip-flops of the electrons located on the inner small
quantum dots. Noteworthy, the frequency of the oscillations decreases
with small @xmath values, corresponding to the multielectron dot level
detuned very far from the inner dots levels. Inversely, for a large
positive pulse on gate @xmath the oscillations become faster as the
multielectron dot level gets into resonance and, ultimately, shifts
below the single particle levels of the inner dots (which will follow
from the analysis presented later). The bending of the oscillatory
pattern for short interaction times is a result of 0.8 ns rise time of
the voltage pulses. Complementary evidence for the presence of the
exchange interaction between the two electrons located on the inner
quantum dots is provided by the leakage spectroscopy measurement,
mapping the position of the crossings between various spin states
(Supplementary Section 15.3 ).

Next, we confirm the correlation between single-shot outcomes. In this
measurement we fix interaction time @xmath ns and vary the amplitude of
the exchange-inducing pulse (see Supplementary Section 15.1 ). The joint
probabilities of singlet and triplet readout outcomes in the two DQDs
are presented in Fig. 14.2 (b). The obtained oscillations of singlet and
triplet outcomes are correlated, and we observe the constant background
of the anticorrelated counts. Histograms of the recorded single-shot
readouts for several exchange pulse amplitudes are presented in Fig.
14.2 (c). The joint probabilities were estimated from the histograms by
fitting the quadruple Gaussian, followed by a correction for the
relaxation during the measurement time (see Supplementary Section 15.2
).

The oscillations observed here are a result of the precession between
the initialized @xmath state and the fully entangled @xmath state. Here
the two kets indicates the state of the left and right DQD,
respectively. The spin triplet states are labeled according to the
standard convention, @xmath , @xmath , @xmath . As a consequence, we
expect fully correlated readouts and oscillations visibility of 75%.
Fig. 14.2 (b) shows that both predictions are almost fulfilled. We
attribute the observed background of anticorrelated outcomes, which
decreases the oscillations visibility, to the interaction between the
electrons located on the outer dots with the nuclear bath, as well as
finite bandwidth of the voltage pulses.

#### 14.4 Three regimes of the exchange interaction

Thereafter, we explore different regimes of the exchange interaction
mediated by the multielectron quantum dot. For that purpose we define a
new gate voltage parameter @xmath (where @xmath is a constant;
Supplementary Section 15.1 ), which controls the detuning between the
single particle levels of the two inner dots. In Fig. 14.3 (a), we fix
the interaction time to @xmath ns and map out the oscillations as a
function of @xmath and @xmath . In this figure fringes correspond to the
lines at which the acquired phase is fixed (as indicated by the
annotations). Since the interaction time @xmath is fixed, these fringes
correspond also to lines of constant exchange, up to distortions due to
the voltage pulse bandwidth.

For negative @xmath the exchange interaction is the weakest, and it
gradually increases for larger @xmath . The exchange interaction
strength increases most rapidly for @xmath where, for @xmath 20 mV, the
fringes are blurred due to decoherence and aliasing. For large @xmath
the exchange increases more slowly, but ultimately the oscillations
become impossible to resolve as well. We also observe that the obtained
pattern is almost symmetric with respect to @xmath .

To understand the pattern we measure the charge distribution during the
interaction (Supplementary Section 15.5 ). The extracted positions of
the charge transitions are indicated in Fig. 14.3 (a) by the dashed
lines while the deduced positions of the electrons are illustrated in
Fig 14.3 (b). In the region labeled I the inner dots remain singly
occupied, and the multielectron dot remains in the initial charge state.
In this case the virtual occupation of the multielectron quantum dot
mediates the exchange interaction, as explained in detail in Ref. [ 160
] .

In the region IIa and IIb one of the electrons is moved to the
multielectron dot and the effective many-body spin 1/2 exchange
interacts directly with the second electronic spin. The symmetry between
these two configurations gives raise to the symmetry of the oscillations
pattern with respect to @xmath . The slight asymmetry arises form the
inequality between the tunneling of the electrons from the left and the
right inner dot to the central multielectron dot.

Finally, in region III the chemical potential of the multielectron dot
is decreased so much that both of the electrons tunnel on the
multielectron dot, and interact while being on the same site. Depending
on the relative spin, either both electrons occupy the same, lowest
orbital, or the lowest and the second lowest orbital. The energy
difference between these levels is a limit to the strength of the
exchange interaction, which is given by the two mesoscopic parameters:
the level spacing @xmath and the difference of the Coulomb repulsion
between electrons occupying the same or two different orbitals [ 196 ,
175 , 167 ] .

#### 14.5 Extremum in the exchange interaction strength

For the interaction time of @xmath ns we cannot resolve the pattern in
on-site exchange interaction regime. For that purpose we decrease the
interaction time to @xmath ns and measure a pattern of oscillations as a
function of the inner quantum dots @xmath and voltage on the gate @xmath
(Fig. 14.4 (a)). At the transition between direct and on-site exchange
interaction regimes we observe a peculiar series of arcs. These indicate
that, instead of increasing monotonously, exchange strength as a
function of @xmath goes through a maximum.

In Fig. 14.4 (b), we present time-dependent exchange oscillations
measured in a asymmetric configuration, i.e. for @xmath mV (indicated
with a blue triangle in Fig. 14.3 (a)). In this data we observe a
chevron pattern indicating the extremum in the exchange energy [ 169 ,
196 ] with respect to @xmath . The presence of a maximum is a
consequence of the small level spacing of the multielectron quantum dot
and particular ratio of tunneling to the lowest unoccupied orbitals. The
specific conditions for the maximum to occur are discussed in Ref. [ 196
] , where we study the interaction between spin-1/2 multielectron
quantum dot and a single electron. The maximum observed here has the
same origin, with the only difference being that the effective spin 1/2
is formed for a brief moment by moving one of the electrons into the
multielectron dot.

Moreover, we observe two characteristic positions at which the
oscillations fidelity is particularly high. First, for large values of
@xmath , the exchange energy is given only by the mesoscopic parameters
of the dot, which are virtually insensitive to the small disturbances.
This noise insensitive region is identical to the one noted in Ref. [ 12
] and one exploited by the hybrid spin qubit realized in the
three-electron double quantum dot [ 58 , 60 ] . Second high-fidelity
position is located at the chevron pattern. Here, the maximum in the
exchange strength provides insensitivity to the detuning between the
energy of the electron residing on the multielectron and one residing on
the inner dot. In the presented configuration of the device the
oscillation frequency at both noise-insensitive points is too high to
perform rotations by small angles. However by decreasing tunnel
couplings between the single electron and multielectron quantum dots the
latter low-frequency point can be tuned down to a manageable frequency [
169 ] of approximately 1 GHz.

#### 14.6 Perspective for use of the multielectron quantum dots

The natural next step after this demonstration is to use a multielectron
quantum dot of larger dimensions. This will enable to define multiple
single-electron quantum dots around the multielectron dot, and perform
coherent operation on arbitrary pair of electrons. Increase of the
coupler size has additional advantage of reducing the on-site exchange
energy which would enable performing high-fidelity, small-angle
rotations. Another challenge is to implement this coupling scheme in a
silicon nanostructure, to reduce decoherence effects due to interaction
with nuclear spins. Third, demonstrated manipulation of the electrons
involving the multielectron quantum dot provides a strong evidence that
it is possible to coherently shuttle the electrons through the
multielectron quantum dot. Combination of this three achievements will
open a path for scaling the quantum dot based systems.

To conclude, we demonstrate that the multielectron quantum dot can serve
as an exchange interaction mediator between distant electronic spins. We
show that the interaction can be induced in three different ways, by
keeping the electronic spins on distant quantum dots or by transferring
one or both of them onto a multielectron dot. We show two regions in the
gate voltage space at which the qubits susceptibility to the charge
noise during the interaction is reduced. Finally, we sketch the plan for
transforming this proof-of-principle experiment into a scalable system
of quantum dots.

### Chapter 15 Supplementary Information for “Fast coherent
spin-exchange via a multielectron quantum mediator” {tcolorbox}

[width=0.8breakable, size=minimal, colback=white] This supplementary
information discusses the following topics:

1.   Definitions of the varied gate-voltage parameters

2.   Achieving a subnanosecond temporal resolution of the exchange
    pulses

3.   Mapping the position of the crossings between spin states with
    different total spin projection @xmath

4.   Calculation of the joint probabilities

5.   Measurement of the charge distribution during interaction between
    distant electrons

#### 15.1 Definitions of the varied gate-voltage parameters

In the quintuple quantum dot fully-tuned up to the experiment showing
exchange interaction mediated by the multielecron quantum dot it is
impossible to measure the full five-dot charge diagram. This is because
the co-tunneling process from the leads to the multielectron quantum dot
is strongly suppressed, since the electron must co-tunnel through one of
the two double quantum dots. For that reason the set up of the pulse
sequences is performed in steps, starting with the choice of the readout
configuration.

The DC tuning of the quintuple quantum dot corresponding to the readout
position is therefore an origin of the gate-voltage space in which the
pulses are performed. The rough configuration of the readout point is
done based of the “partial” charge diagrams in which the plunger gates
controlling the occupations of the two DQDs are sweeped. Fine tuning of
the readout configuration is done my running one of the pulse sequences
and maximization of the signal amplitude with small adjustments of the
DC gate voltages. Unless stated explicitly, voltages on all gates are
measured relative to the readout configuration.

As a first step of the sequence tune-up we perform simultaneously the
leakage spectroscopy [ 169 , 196 ] (so-called “spin funnel” measurement
[ 7 , 14 ] ) of both double quantum dots. In this measurement we
simultaneously vary parameters @xmath and @xmath (the gates to which the
voltages are applied are shown in Fig. 14.1 (a) in the main text). The
example of the obtained result is shown in the left panels of Fig. 15.1
(a,b). This measurement we use to set the separation point, in which
both double quantum dots are in (1,1) charge configuration and the
exchange interaction strength is minimized. As a separation point we
choose a value of @xmath for which the line features lies between @xmath
and @xmath mT. In case of Fig. 15.1 (a,b) the separation point is
situated at @xmath mV and @xmath mV.

The separation point (indicated with a superscript @xmath ) serves as a
reference for the pulse inducing the multielectron-dot-mediated exchange
interaction. From the separation point we define a new pulse direction
@xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (15.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

where normalization factor @xmath was chosen to ensure that change of
@xmath by one was corresponding to distance 1 in the gate voltage space
with a Cartesian metric.

On the @xmath axis we choose the final reference point (indicated with
superscript @xmath ). With respect to that point we define a variable
@xmath which corresponds to detuning between the two inner
single-electron quantum dots.

The data presented in this article was acquired in several slightly
different DC gate voltage tuning (Table 15.1 ), however the principle of
the pulse tune-up applies to all of the datasets. In between dataset
there was no significant retuning of the quintuple dot array, and
therefore the tunnel couplings can be considered unchanged throughout
the entire experiment, while definitions of the reference points
(indicated with superscripts @xmath and @xmath ) as well as @xmath axis
were changed.

#### 15.2 Achieving a subnanosecond temporal resolution of the exchange
pulses

To achieve a subnanosecond resolution of the exchange pulse we use
combined signal of the two arbitrary waveform generator channels to
pulse voltage on the multielectron-dot plunger gate @xmath . We set the
two channels to output a square waveform of the same duration and
amplitude, but opposite polarity, and combine them using the inverted
power splitter. Rising slope of the pulses is set to the beginning of
the intended exchange pulse, while the falling slope happens at the
beginning of the spin initialization procedure. The duration of the
subnanosecond voltage pulse is then adjusted with a skew between the two
channels of the arbitrary waveform generator. Importantly, this method
allows to overcome the limitations of the temporal resolution, but is
constrained by the 0.8 ns pulse risetime in our setup, which leads to
distortion effects in Figs. 2, 3 and 4 in the main text.

#### 15.3 Mapping the position of the crossings between spin states with
different total spin projection @xmath

One of the methods for detection and quantification of the exchange
interaction is the leakage spectroscopy. In the double dot case it can
be used to locate the position of the crossing between the singlet
@xmath and the fully polarized triplet @xmath state (the sign of the
electronic g-factor defines which of the triplet states is used), and
results in the characteristic funnel shape [ 7 , 14 ] . In more complex
case of the triple quantum dot the position of the analogous crossing,
which depends on the value of the external magnetic field, enables the
reconstruction of the exchange profile [ 88 , 196 , 169 ] . Here we
employ the same technique for our case of the two double quantum dots,
coupled with multielectron dot mediator.

The sequence of the applied voltage pulses is the same as in the
time-resolved study of the exchange interaction mediated my the
multielectron quantum dot, with the only exception being that the
interaction time is set to @xmath ns which is much longer that dephasing
time due to Overhauser field and the charge noise. The left panels of
Fig. 15.1 (a,b) present the position of the @xmath - @xmath crossing for
the two DQDs, acquired simultaneously, identical to the conventional
“spin funnel” [ 7 , 14 ] . The overlap of the two line-features is only
apparent, as the horizontal axes correspond to different gate-voltage
parameters (detunings of the left @xmath and the right @xmath DQD).

The right panels of Fig. 15.1 (a,b) present the result in the regime
where the long-range exchange turns on. In this case the horizontal axis
is shared. We observe that the in the central part the lines indicating
the level crossing does not overlap, as underlined with blue and red
dotted lines. Meanwhile, in the rightmost part, the line indicating
crossing perfectly overlaps (green dotted line) and diverges towards the
large field. In the intermediate region a signature of the anticrossing
can be observed as well.

This agrees with a Heisenberg model of the 4 exchange-coupled 1/2 spins
arranged in a linear array (multielectron dot is neglected in the model,
and only the exchange interaction it mediates is considered). Energy
diagram with arbitrary dependence of the three exchange interactions
reveals all of the relevant features (Fig. 15.1 (c)). In the left side
of the diagram only exchange interaction within DQDs is nonzero. This
allows us to identify the crossings detected in the leakage spectroscopy
measurement. On the contrary, in the right only the exchange interaction
mediated by the multielectron quantum dot is nonzero.

The lines in the left part of Fig. 15.1 (a,b) correspond to the @xmath -
@xmath crossing on the left and the right DQD. In the two-DQDs pictures
these are @xmath - @xmath and @xmath - @xmath crossings indicated with,
respectively, blue and red triangle. In the middle part of the energy
diagram and leakage spectroscopy data @xmath and @xmath states start to
hybridize due to the exchange mediated by the multielectron dot. As a
results only one of the line features continues (as indicated with the
red to green dotted line transition), while the other one ends (blue
dotted line) and continues slightly shifted (green dashed line). This
indicates the position at which @xmath and @xmath are no more the
eigenstates, but their superposition @xmath is (the green line in 15.1
(b)). At this stage also @xmath state is no longer an eigenstate while
@xmath and @xmath are (the orange line).

#### 15.4 Calculation of the joint probabilities

The joint probabilities, presented in Fig. 14.2 (b), are calculated
based of the histograms of single shot outcomes for each pulse amplitude
(presented in the Supplementary Video 1). In the first step we fit the
2-dimensional quadruple Gaussian to the histogram including multiple
pulse amplitudes. From this fit we obtain the position of the four peaks
(8 parameters) and their widths (2 parameters, we use different
distribution widths for measurements performed with different sensors,
and set them to be the same for all 4 Gaussian). The data and the fit
are presented in Fig. 15.2 (a). Having fixed the positions and widths we
fit the amplitude of the Gaussians to outcomes histograms for each
voltage pulse amplitude separately. The normalized amplitudes of
Gaussians yield the joint probabilities, uncorrected for the decay
during the measurement.

To correct for the decay of the two-electron states in the DQDs we fix
the amplitude of the exchange-inducing pulse at the value that yields
significant number of counts for all 4 possible outcomes and introduce
the waiting time in the readout configuration, before we perform the
actual measurement. Fig. 15.2 (b) presents the obtained decay curves.
Next we introduce the minimal model of the decay, in which the triplet
states decay to singlet independently of the state of the other DQD, and
with the rates different for both DQDs. This model is not physically
accurate for several reasons – the state of one DQD may affect another
and decay rates are expected to differ for different triplet states. Yet
in absence of the insight into full relaxation dynamics we decide to
limit ourselves to the simplest possible scenario.

Having fitted the decay rates for both DQDs (see Fig. 15.2 (b)) we can
reverse the relation between measured probabilities and the real
probabilities:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (15.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are the vectors of possible real/measured outcome
probabilities, @xmath is the introduces the decay during the waiting
time @xmath and @xmath is the total readout time of 7 @xmath s (as
indicated with the gray-haded region in Fig. 15.2 (b)). The integration
is performed to include decay that occurs during the readout time.
Application of the numerically inversed relation ( 15.2 ) yields the
calculated joint probability of the four states.

#### 15.5 Measurement of the charge distribution during interaction
between distant electrons

To independently confirm the position of the electrons during the
interaction step we extending the interaction time to 4 @xmath s, while
maintaining the remainder of the pulse sequence unchanged. During this
time we perform a measurement using both charge sensors. This is
repeated for several settings of the charge sensor since the sensor is
sensitive only when it is set to the slope of the sensor quantum dot
Coulomb peak. We perform the numerical derivative of each data set, than
apply blur by convolving with them Gaussian kernel ( @xmath pixel) and
take the absolute value to take advantage of the sensitivity on both
slopes of the Coulomb peaks. Finally we sum the obtained data sets with
various weights. The processed data obtained in this way is presented in
Fig. 15.3 . The inferred charge transitions are indicated with dashed
black lines. The features indicating the electron transfer from one of
the inner dots to the multielectron dot are very weak, due to large
tunnel couplings, which were necessary to observe the superexchange. The
two region in the bottom left and right of the Fig. 15.3 correspond to,
respectively, (1,1, @xmath ,1,0) and (0,1, @xmath ,1,1) charge
configurations of the quintuple quantum dot.

Except for the indicated charge transitions one can observed additional
features which have no counterparts in the data set presenting exchange
oscillations (Fig. 14.3 (a)). This is the case because the exchange
oscillations occur in the metastable electron configuration of the
quintuple dot array. As long as the interaction time is much shorter
than the relaxation rates it is irrelevant for the spin manipulations.
However, as we increase the interaction time to perform the measurement
of the charge distribution the relaxation occurs for the significant
fraction of the pulse repetitions.

### Chapter 16 Outlook

The study of the multielectron quantum dot, and demonstration of the
long range exchange interaction opens several paths for further
research, both basic and towards scaling of the spin qubit systems. In
this final chapter of the thesis I contrast the long range exchange
coupling with other currently studied coupling mechanisms. Then I
propose several follow-up experiments towards scaling of the quantum dot
systems involving the multielectron-dot–mediated exchange interaction.

#### 16.1 Coupling mechanisms for spin qubits

The exchange interaction mediated by the multielectron quantum dot,
demonstrated in chapter 14 , is only one among several mechanisms
proposed to realize the two qubit gates. Our approach is motivated by
the original proposal of Daniel Loss and David DiVincenzo [ 5 ] , in
which a direct exchange is a basis for two qubit gates. This idea
provided the potential for high fidelity operations [ 64 , 68 ] . It is
also relatively simple to realize in small quantum dot arrays but it
does not take into account the technical limitations related to
fabrication of large arrays of closely spaced quantum dots.
Nevertheless, this approach can be used in small segments of the large
quantum dot arrays, that would communicate with each other by means of
one of the other mechanisms I describe below.

One possibility to provide communication between small segments of the
processor is to physically shuttle the electrons while maintaining their
coherence [ 154 ] . The demonstration of this concept was realized in
arrays of up to four quantum dots [ 193 , 203 ] , where an electron was
moved by sequentially adjusting the gate voltages dots to transfer
electrons between the neighboring dots. The obtained results provide the
evidence that neither relaxation nor dephasing is enhanced during
shuttling of the electrons. On the other hand, using an array of small
dots to shuttle electrons does not simplify the device fabrication.
Another possibility is to create a narrow, empty channel between only
two metallic gates and use a surface acoustic wave to carry the electron
through. Proof of principle for this approach was presented in Refs. [
204 , 153 ] , although high reliability of classical information
transport, and preservation of coherence are yet to be established.

Meanwhile, a relatively high fidelity of the two qubit gates was
demonstrated with capacitively coupled S-T @xmath qubits [ 37 , 22 ] .
This method, that can be generalized to other multidot qubits, employs
the difference in the charge distribution between singlet and triplet
states at the transition between (2,0) and (1,1) dot occupancies [ 154 ]
. One can view this interaction as a small change in the detuning @xmath
of one double quantum dot, conditioned on the state of the other qubit
(and vice versa) [ 205 , 206 ] . The challenge in capacitive coupling is
that it is relatively short range ¹ ¹ 1 Dipole-dipole interaction scales
as @xmath , with the distance @xmath . , especially considering the
screening by the dot-defining metallic gates. This constraint can be
lifted by means of the floating gates, extending between the two qubits
[ 189 ] . Another, more fundamental problem is that using the charge
degree of freedom introduces a susceptibility to the charge noise.
Therefore the reduction of the noise ² ² 2 As opposed to suppression by
means of qubit symmetrization. Symmetrization minimizes the difference
in charge distribution between the spin states but suppresses the
coupling as well. It is worth noting that switching between symmetric
and tilted operation of the qubits provides a mean to switch the
capacitative coupling on and off. is necessary if capacitative coupling
was to be used in large quantum dot arrays.

Similar limitation constraints the usage of superconducting microwave
cavities [ 156 , 55 ] . For this proposal the potential payoff is the
increase in the coupling range up to a millimeter scale (given by the
wavelength of the photon propagating in the superconducting co-planar
waveguide). Up to date the first step towards cavity-mediated coupling,
i.e. the strong coupling between a charge qubit and the cavity photon,
was demonstrated by three groups [ 23 , 24 , 46 ] . In all cases the key
to obtain these results was the reduction of the charge noise
contribution, combined with maximization of the photon electric field at
the dots site.

Finally, the exchange coupling mediated by the multielectron quantum dot
can be used to perform exchange gates between relatively distant spins.
The maximum size of the quantum dot that can mediate such interaction is
crucial to ultimately assess whether this mechanism is suitable for
scalable dot arrays. At the same time the electrons could be shuttled
between distant locations through the multielectron quantum dot. The
ability to perform both, the long-range coupling and the shuttling of
physical qubits, would be unprecedented in the field of solid state
quantum computing.

To summarize, given the current state of the art it is virtually
impossible to predict which of the coupling mechanisms will be the most
successful. Direct exchange interaction suffers from the gate crowding,
which may be less limiting with the progress of the nanofabrication
techniques. Capacitative coupling provides a mean to create dense
arrays, while circumventing the extreme crowding, but requires reduction
of the charge noise by several orders of magnitude to achieve the
fault-tolerant fidelities. A similar restriction also applies to
coupling via the superconducting resonator, which, on the other hand,
can ultimately resolve the issue of the dense qubit packing. Finally,
multielectron quantum dots can be employed to provide long-range
communication between quantum dots, provided that reasonably large
quantum dots can host a spin-0 ground state spaced from the first
excited state by sufficiently large level spacing.

#### 16.2 Next steps towards scaling of quantum dot arrays with exchange
coupling

Scaling the array of long-range exchange coupled quantum dots is a
challenging task. Yet the demonstration of the
multielectron-dot–mediated exchange interaction enables to set several
goals that can be achieved in the nearest futures.

First, it is essential to demonstrate the long-range exchange in a
device fabricated in a material with sparse spinful nuclei, such as
Si/SiGe quantum wells or a MOS structure; or in a structure where the
spin carriers are more weakly coupled to the nuclear spins, such as GaAs
hole quantum wells. The reason is that a short inhomogeneous dephasing
time for an electronic spin establishes an ultimate limit to the
fidelity of the spin manipulations in GaAs. Stabilization of the
Overhauser field via dynamical nuclear polarization in combination with
dynamically decoupled gates will delay the moment of transition to a
different system, but the amount of the overhead involved will become
limiting sooner rather than later. Nevertheless, multiple nearest
objectives can be realized with GaAs electron quantum dots, in parallel
to progress in the reliability of fabrication of other structures.

For example it is crucial to experimentally establish the dependence of
the mean level spacing with the area of the multielectron quantum dot.
In particular it is important to establish the maximum dot size that
reliably provides a level spacing larger than the energy corresponding
to the typical electron temperature ( @xmath @xmath eV for @xmath mK,
which corresponds to @xmath GHz). This gives a bound on the maximum
distance between the exchange-coupled spins. A ballpark estimate can be
obtained from the model of non-interacting electrons in a hard box
yields @xmath . This yields a maximum dot area of 0.36 @xmath m @xmath
for electrons in GaAs (factor of 12 relative to size of dot studied in
Ch. 14 ), 0.12 @xmath m @xmath for electrons in Si and 0.055 @xmath m
@xmath for heavy holes in GaAs. However the interaction effects and
unknown depletion area around the metallic gates may result in
significant deviations from this prediction. Moreover, the spin
correlation energy can reduce the spacing between the spin-0 ground
state and spin-1 excited state. The outcome may point towards using
either elongated dot-buses rather than circular multielectron quantum
dots.

Studying if the mean level spacing on the multielectron dot area can be
performed on the device that was employed in the experiments presented
in this part (Fig. 16.1 ). The size of the multielectron quantum dot can
be increased by adjoining the neighbouring regions, intended originally
to host single electron dots. This proposal is very simple to realize
experimentally, due to very weak capacitative coupling between the gates
defining the farthest edge of the multielectron dot and the double
quantum dot which can serves for spin initialization and readout. The
device shown in Fig. 16.1 enables to also demonstrate the coupling via
an elongated multielectron quantum dot, provided the first experiment
yields a promising results.

Knowing the maximum dimensions of the coupling dot, one can attempt to
couple multiple qubits via the same mediator. This would increase the
connectivity within a quantum dot array, potentially reducing number of
operations required to realize a quantum algorithms. An example of
device geometry suitable for such demonstration is presented in Fig.
16.2 . This design combines the dimensions of both single-electron and
sensor dots that proved to be easily tunable, with the multielectron
quantum dot that has an area sufficiently small to provide level spacing
much larger than @xmath .

The conditions required for the long distance exchange coupling of spins
are simultaneously the conditions for the coherent transport of spin
through the multielectron quantum dot. As demonstrated in Sec. 12.4 a
single excess electron preserves coherence while residing on the
multielectron quantum dot, enabling the measurement of the Overhauser
field gradient. There is no obstacle to transfer it afterwards to a
different quantum dot. Such experiment can be conducted in both device
geometries presented in Figs. 16.1 and 16.2 . In particular, the
electron transfer between red and green-colored dots in Fig. 16.1 can be
realized either through one, extremely elongated dot, or through two
multielectron dots of half the size.

These numerous possibilities, most of which can be demonstrated in
available, working and tested devices provide a compelling argument for
using the multielectron quantum dots. In particular the possibility to
demonstrate the long range coupling and long range coherent transfer of
physical qubits via the same mediator is unique to this proposal.

## Part V Appendix

### Appendix A Setup

In this chapter you’ll find a description of all the electronics in the
experimental:

-   the DC part which allows to shape the quantum dot potential and
    perform basic transport measurements ( A.1 );

-   the HF part that is responsible for applying nano- to milisecond
    voltage pulses ( A.2 );

-   the reflectometry setup and demodulation circuit ( A.2 ).

In further sections I will focus on certain extensions of the setup,
that are used to:

-   combine HF pulses and RF bursts ( A.3 );

-   synchronise multiple AWGs ( A.4 );

-   readout two sensors simultaneously ( A.5 ).

#### a.1 DC/LF circuit

A low frequency circuit consists of two parts – for gate control and
transport measurements (Fig. A.1 ). The gate voltages are controlled
with homemade DACs (called DecaDACs) to provide stable voltage on gates
forming quantum dots. DecaDACs were built by Jim MacArthur from Harvard
electronics shop. Each of these has 20 16-bit channels that can operate
in ranges 0-10, -10-10 and -10-0 V. To increase resolution of 30 @xmath
V voltage on each channel was divided (1:5). The lines are brought down
to the mixing chamber using 24 line constantan looms which are
thermalized at every stage of the fridge. At mixing chamber the lines
are RC and RF filtered to minimize instrumentation and Johnson’s noise.
RC filter consists of 80 MHz low-pass filter (Mini-Circuits LFCN-80),
two 2 k @xmath resistors and two 2.7 nF capacitors. Cut-off frequency of
this filter is approximately 30 kHz. The RF filter consists of three
components: 80 MHz low pass filter (Mini-Circuits LFCN-80), 1.45 GHz low
pass filter (Mini-Circuits LFCN-1450) and 5 GHz low pass filter
(Mini-Circuits LFCN-5000). DC lines that are combined with HF lines (not
shown on a scheme) go through additional bias tee, which I will describe
in section A.2 .

Part of the circuit used for transport measurements consists of DecaDAC
(a source of DC bias) and SR830 lock (an AC source). Their signals is
combined and divided in the adder (with ratios 1: @xmath 400 for DC and
1: @xmath 18000 for AC). Than line goes down the fridge through a set of
filters (identical to ones on gate-controlling lines) and is connected
to the source ohmic of the sample. Drain ohmic is connected to a low
noise Ithaco 1211 current preamplifier. Its two outputs are connected to
Agilent 34401A DMM and lock-in SR830 to measure, respectively, the
current and conductance. Some ohmic lines are combined on the sample
board with reflectometry lines via bias-tees and go through tank
circuits. I will describe these parts of the circuit later (Sec. A.2 ).

#### a.2 HF and reflectometry circuit

The primary purpose of the high-frequency (HF) circuit is to apply
pulses to the gates with nanosecond temporal resolution and to perform
measurements on a microsecond timescale. Additionally, we use them to
apply a sawtooth wave of 2 kHz frequency. By synchronising measurements
with period of the sawtooth we can speed up measurements of charge
diagrams. I will describe this technique in chapter C and now focus only
on the experimental setup.

The heart of the circuit is an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG)
Tektronix 5014c. As shown in figure A.2 , it sends the pulses, via
attenuators, down the fridge. At the Mayo PCB high frequency pulses are
combined with DC signal using bias-tees ( @xmath k @xmath , @xmath nF).
Combined signal arrives to the sample. To synchronise pulses with the
measurement we connect one of the marker channels to the AlazarTech PCI
digitalizer (ATS 9440), which is used for reflectometry measurements.

To perform reflectometry measurements we need to send the RF carrier
signal down the fridge, collect reflected signal, amplify, demodulate
and deliver to the Alazar card. The RF source is Stanford Research SG384
signal generator, operating at resonant frequency of the tank circuit
(see below), typically between 100 and 250 MHz. RF signal is divided in
directional coupler. Most of the signal (optimally 13 dBm) goes directly
to the mixer and will serve as a reference. Smaller part of the signal
goes through the phase shifter (needed to adjust phase of reflected
signal relative to the reference signal) and RF switch (which we use to
turn the RF carrier on only during the measurements). Than the signal
goes through a set of filters and variable attenuators, which allows to
control RF power at the sample. At the bottom of the fridge RF carrier
arrives to the next directional coupler. Small part of the signal goes
through, is combined with DC signal and hits the resonant circuit.

The resonant circuit consists of the inductor (typically 700 to 1200
nH), parasitic capacitance to ground and resistance ( @xmath 1 pF), and
resistance of the sensor quantum dot ( @xmath 0.2 @xmath ). When
properly tuned the resistance of the quantum dot changes depending on
the charge state of the qubit. In turn, this resistance modifies the
impedance of the resonant circuit and therefore the amplitude of the
reflected signal. For detailed description of principles of readout
using reflectometry I recommend Christian Barthel’s thesis [ 207 ] .

The reflected signal goes back to the directional coupler, now to the
low-loss input. At the pulse tube plate 2 the signal is amplified with
the CITLF1 cryo-amplifier (co-called Weinreb amplifier). Outside of the
fridge the signal goes through a set of filters, additional amplifier
and arrives at the mixer. The demodulated signal is once more filtered
and amplified and sent to the DMM (for monitoring purposes) and to the
Alazar PCI digitalizer.

The setup has one more element: AWG Agilent 33250A that is used to
generate sawtooth wave. This sawtooth wave can be overlaid with the fast
pulses using “add input” option of the Tektronix AWG. Synchronization of
the sawtooth with the Alazar card allows to use for the acquisition of
the charge diagrams (chapter C ).

#### a.3 Adding RF to HF pulses

Operation of a spin qubits such as resonant-exchange or Loss-DiVincenzo
requires application of RF voltage pulses as well as pulses of arbitrary
shape on the same gate. For that purpose we built the following
extension of the setup (Fig. A.3 ).

Two of the channels of Tektronix 5014c AWG were used to apply pulses on
gates. They both are connected to one of the outputs of ZESC-2-11+ power
splitter. In case of the channel 1 the other output of the splitter is
50 @xmath terminated.

Another two channels of the AWG are used to modulate in-phase and
quadrature of the RF signal generated by a vector source R&S SMBV100A.
The output of the RF goes through a in/out DC block which breaks a
ground loop, a high-pass filter and a 20 dB attenuator. In the end RF is
combined with the signal from 2nd AWG channel on with the power
splitter.

Observant reader would notice that in this setup the RF signal will
necessarily be delayed relative to the signal from the AWG. This delay
is of the order of tens of nanoseconds and needs to be calibrated out.
Correction in done software by delaying pulses on channels 1 and 2
relative to the channels 3 and 4.

#### a.4 Synchronisation of multiple AWGs

Most of the multi-qubit experiments require more than 4 fast signals,
and therefore synchronisation of multiple AWGs. For synchronisation one
needs to provide AWGs with a common 10 MHz reference and a common
external trigger. In our experiment we used SRS FS725 Rubidium frequency
standard to generate 10 MHz reference and Agilent 33250A AWG to generate
a square wave that triggered two Tektronix 5014c AWGs.

However, if you do just that, you will find out that part of the time
the AWGs are one clock cycle off. To eliminate that you need to use the
cables of the same length for triggering. Moreover if AWGs are supposed
to output the sequence, it’s good to run the trigger continuously so it
would trigger both AWGs at the beginning of each pulse, not only at the
beginning of each sequence. Importantly, the period of the triggering
square wave needs to be an integer multiple of AWG clock period. This
means also that it also has to use the same 10 MHz reference. Otherwise
AWGs might be one clock cycle off most of the time.

#### a.5 Simultaneous readout of two sensors

The final improvement to the setup was an extension of the demodulation
circuit (Fig. A.5 ) to enable simultaneous measurement of two sensor
dots embedded in resonant circuit of distinct resonant frequencies. To
large extent this circuit is a doubled circuit from Fig. A.2 .

Two signal generators produce two RF tones. Signal from each of them
goes through a directional coupler to the mixer. The other outputs of
the directional couplers are connected through the phase shifters to
outputs of the power splitter where the two frequencies are combined.
The combined RF carrier goes through the RF switch, common for both
frequencies, and a set of filters and attenuators to the fridge.

The reflected signal is splitted at the output of the fridge and
demodulated with two reference signals in two separate mixers. In this
way we get two DC outputs that can be connected to DMMs or Alazar card.

### Appendix C Real-time measurements of charge diagrams

During the measurements of the PDN 7c sample we realized that
reflectometry measurements are sufficiently sensitive, to acquire charge
diagrams of reasonable quality with averaging time of 50 @xmath s per
pixel (0.5 s for 100 @xmath 100 image). On the other we knew that
measuring such a charge diagram took us typically 20 s. The difference
between these times is is a consequence of sending multiple commands to
the DecaDAC to step DC voltage on the gates. In the following I will
describe how we used DAC sweeps and sawtooth waves synchronised with the
Alazar card to take advantage of high sensitivity, and realized
real-time measurements of charge diagrams with up to 5 fps.

The technique was to the large extend based on legacy code developed by
Jim Medford. It was implemented in IgorPro, in the experiment file which
kept evolving since times of Alex Johnson, Jason Petta and first
coherent operations on single electrons [ 7 , 202 ] .

While developing the code we learned that similar technique was
developed in Jason Petta group [ 208 ] . Their readout technique was
based on measurement of transmission of the cavity coupled to nanowire
double quantum dot. Usage of higher carrier frequencies ( @xmath 8 GHz)
allowed to use Josephson parametric amplifier, which boosted signal to
noise ratio and let them cut down measurement time of a single charge
diagram to 20 ms. The noteworthy difference between the two techniques
is that cavity-based readout relies on the tunneling rates being
comparable or larger that the RF excitation frequency, which limits the
sensitivity to more “pinched-off” charge transitions. In case of the
SET-based charge sensing this constraint weaker, and is given by the
sweeping rate of the gate voltages ( @xmath 5 @xmath s per pixel in our
case, corresponding to @xmath 200 kHz tunneling rate).

#### c.1 The principle of operation

To perform real-time measurements of charge diagrams you need two
voltage sources capable of sweeping voltage or applying a sawtooth wave.
We used DecaDAC to sweep voltage on one of the gates with variable speed
and Agilent 33250A AWG to apply fixed-frequency sawtooth wave on another
(Fig. C.1 ). The signal from Agilent AWG was transmitted through
Tektronix AWG which can add a high frequency waveform to the sawtooth.

As show in Fig. C.2 (a) DecaDAC sweeps voltage only once while acquiring
a single charge diagram, while Agilent AWG is continuously applying 1903
Hz sawtooth wave. (Because of timescales separation these devices don’t
need to be synchronised.) This results in a zig-zag path in gate voltage
space that covers the entire mapped area (Fig. C.2 (b))

To acquire the charge diagram Alazar card is triggered at the beginning
of each sawtooth sweep and collects data for ¹ ¹ 1 Exact frequeny is
irrelevant. It needs to be significantly higher than the cutoff
frequency of the bias-tees wich add high-frequency and DC voltage. On
the other hand it should be as low as possible to minimize artifacts
which appear when the sawtooth frequency is comparable to the tunneling
rates. 1/(1903 Hz) @xmath 0.5 ms. Sample speed throughout each of the
traces is set to 100 MS/s, which corresponds to @xmath 50000 points per
sawtooth period. Subsequent points are then averaged together to obtain
specified horizontal resolution. Few of such traces are then averaged
together, typically 5-20 in the live-view mode and 50-100 for high
quality diagrams. The averaged trace corresponds to a single horizontal
line in the final charge diagram. This procedure is repeated to obtain
demanded vertical resolution. Total acquisition time of @xmath charge
diagram with 10 traces averaged together is therefore 1/1903 Hz @xmath
10 @xmath 50 = 0.26 s. The precalculated total acquisition time is used
to calculate the DecaDAC voltahe sweeping rate.

#### c.2 Code

If you are not using the legacy code you can safely skip this section.

Here I will describe             chargeDiagramTraceAlazar()           
function which is a workhorse of real-time charge diagram acquisition.
The code is written in IgorPro. Knowledge of Igor will be helpful, but
hopefully not necessary to understand the code. I will clarify however,
that mysterious “waves” are simply arrays of floating point numbers.

For completeness – the code described here does not adjust frequency and
amplitude of the sawtooth wave, although this feature is implemented in
GUI.

Function             chargeDiagramTraceAlazar            takes the
following arguments:

-                  waveNom               – string that will be a base
    name of waves storing the output;

-                  DACchan               – integer specifying swept
    DecaDAC channel;

-                  from/to               – starting/final voltage for
    DAC sweep;

-                  points_slow               – resolution of the charge
    diagram along axis swept by DAC;

-                  avg_slow               – number of sawtooth ramps
    averaged together;

-                  points_fast               – resolution of the charge
    diagram along axis swept by Agilent AWG;

-                  channels               – string of letters specifying
    read Alazar channels, separated by semicolons;

-                  noDisp               – variable specifying whether to
    open new window displaying charge diagram,

and does not return anything. But it does create (or overwrite) a
wave(s)             waveNom#            , where             #           
is a letter indicating the channel of the Alazar card.

    function chargeDiagramTraceAlazar(waveNom,DACchan,from,to,points_slow,
                                   avg_slow,points_fast,channels[,noDisp])
        string waveNom, channels
        variable DACchan, from, to, points_slow, avg_slow, points_fast,
                                                              noDisp, copy

By default don’t pop up a new window.

        if(paramisdefault(noDisp)||noDisp == 1)
            noDisp = 1
        else
            noDisp = 0
        endif

Read the global variable which tells whether we’re in single shot
readout mode. If so, reconfigure Alazar card settings. Most importantly
            cmode()            function chooses the Alazar channel that
is used for triggering the measurement and sets sampling rate.

        NVAR AlazarFast = root:AlazarFast
        if(AlazarFast != 0)
            cmode()
        endif

Load information about sampling rate of the Alazar and frequency of the
sawtooth from global variables. We used sampling rate of 100 MSa/s
(maximum rate of ATS9440 card is 125 MSa/s) and sawtooth frequency of
1903 Hz.

        NVAR alazarClock = root:alazarClock                       // 1.0e8
        NVAR rampFreq = root:rampFreq                             // 1903

Calculate how many samples can be taken during a single sweep of a
sawtooth wave. 5 @xmath s is subtracted from the sweep time to provide a
waiting time between end of one measurement and beginning of another.
Then the number of samples is rounded down to the nearest multiple of
16, which is required by the Alazar card. For different models of Alazar
cards number of samples might need to be set to multiple of different
power of 2.

        variable pointsPerRamp = alazarClock/rampFreq-5e-6*alazarClock // 52048.6
        variable mLength = (floor(pointsPerRamp/16))*16                // 52048

Calculate sweeping rate for DecaDAC (in mV/s) according to the sweep
range, averaging and sawtooth wave frequency

        variable speed = abs(from-to)/points_slow/avg_slow*rampFreq

Explanation of the next step requires basic understanding of operation
of XOPs that control the Alazar card. They arrange and manipulate the
date in form of 3-dimensional array. The data acquired within window
that follows each trigger is arranged along the first dimension
(points). Along the second dimension (records) I will arrange data from
            avg_slow            number of subsequent sweeps of a
sawtooth wave. These sweeps will be averaged together to form a single
line on 2D charge diagram. Along the third dimension (buffers) I will
arrange traces that will make subsequent lines on the charge diagram.

        variable buffers = points_slow
        variable records = avg_slow

Set values of variables controlling which of the Alazar channels to
measure

        variable a,b,c,d
        if(FindListItem("A",channels)>=0)
            a = 1
        endif
        if(FindListItem("B",channels)>=0)
            b = 1
        endif
        if(FindListItem("C",channels)>=0)
            c = 1
        endif
        if(FindListItem("D",channels)>=0)
            d = 1
        endif

Set a DAC channel to the initial value and wait a moment to make sure
that the command was applied. Than start sweeping the DAC channel.
Factor of 1.02 and additional waiting time were chosen experimentally to
calibrate out software delays and minimize distortions. Notice that
except for this calibration there is no synchronisation between DAC and
Agilent AWG.

        setval("c"+num2str(DACchan),from)
        wait(0.03)
        rampDAC(DACchan,to,speed*1.02,read=0)
        wait(90*0.0005)

After the beginning of the DAC sweep run the external operating
procedure which acquires data with the Alazar card.
            baseName="test"            specifies base wave name with the
data that will be created in the memory.             id={1,1}           
specifies identifier of the Alazar card.
            cd={a,b,c,d}            specifies measured Alazar channels.
            sample={mLength,records,buffers}            defines
dimensionality of the array of data points described above.
            pointsAvg=mLength/points_fast            tells how many of
the subsequent samples should be averaged together. This will specify
resolution of the charge diagram.             dim=2            specifies
that data array should be averaged along 2nd dimension.

        ATSreadWaveNPT_AVG/q baseName="test",id={1,1}, cd={a,b,c,d},
                                   sample={mLength,records,buffers},
                                   pointsAvg=mLength/points_fast, dim=2

Copy the data from a             test            wave to the wave
specified by user. Than convert volts to milivolts. Factor of
            buffers            is introduced to correct for the bug in
XOP.

        variable i,j
        for(i=1;i<=4;i+=1)
            if((i==1&&a==0)||(i==2&&b==0)||(i==3&&c==0)||(i==4&&d==0))
                continue
            endif
            string chan = num2char(i+64)
            duplicate /o $("test_avg"+chan),$(waveNom+chan)
            wave outWave =$(waveNom+chan)
            outWave *=1000*buffers
        endfor

Create a new window in which charge diagram will be displayed (if user
set             nodisp != 1            ).

        if(noDisp != 1)
            j=1
            for(i=1;i<=4;i+=1)
                chan = num2char(i+64)
                if(FindListItem(chan,channels)>=0)
                    showwaves(waveNom+chan)
                    positionwindow(j)
                    j += 1
                endif
            endfor
        endif
    end

End of function.

The rest of convenient features is hidden behind the GUI, but the heart
of the code is as simple as this.

#### c.3 GUI and additional features

As the acquisition of the charge diagrams becomes much faster than
typing commands into command line, we added a graphical interface (Fig.
C.3 ). It provides a convenient way of setting the range, resolution and
averaging of the scan. Also it allows to choose the measurement of
multiple Alazar channels therefore possibility of measuring multiple
sensors without adding to the measurement time. Separate panel adjusts
to step voltage by @xmath 0.1, 1 or 10 mV on a chosen gate to modify the
charge diagram.

Fast tuning requires continuous adjustments of the sensor dot, since
sensitivity is quickly lost as voltages on the gates are changed by tens
or hundreds of milivolts. These adjustments can be done in a few ways.
In practice we found it is most convenient to manually adjust sensor
plunger voltage with additional panel.

Finally, very often there is need to acquire a large diagram extending
over a range of a few hundred milivolts. However we found that
increasing of the scan range to much more than 50 mV is unpractical for
several reasons. First, the sensor is sensitive only in a narrow range
of voltages. Second, a large amplitude of the sawtooth wave causes
heating of the electron gas, likely due to energy dissipation at the
attenuators mounted at the mixing chamber. Instead we use the approach
of automatic stitching of multiple charge diagrams (Fig. C.4 ). Before
taking each of the diagrams, sensor plunger voltage is approximately
readjusted according to estimated coupling of various gates to the
sensor dot. These can be easily set manually after a few trials and
errors.

#### c.4 Artifacts in charge diagrams due to fast sweeping

Fast measurements of charge diagrams come with certain drawbacks. The
biggest one becomes apparent when tuning multiple-dot structures and
minimizing tunnel coupling to the leads. In such cas tunneling rates
@xmath between the dots and the leads become comparable or smaller than
frequency of the sawtooth wave ( @xmath Hz). This results in distortion,
blurring and shifting of the hcharge transitions corresponding to
barriers with small @xmath .

Typical example of such artifact is presented in Fig. C.5 (a). In this
case the barrier between the left quantum dot and the lead (dashed line)
disappears, and corresponding change of the dolt occupation happens at
different voltage (dotted line). Ther reason for this is the following.
As the voltage is swept from positive the negative values the chemical
potential of the left dot moves above the chemical potential of the
leads (dashed line; Fig. C.5 (b)). However the tunneling does not occur
until efficient path for the electron is energetically available. Ground
state is reached only when arrangement of chemical potentials makes
sequential tunneling through the right quantum dot possible (dotted
lines; Fig. C.5 (c)).

Fortunately, trained eye can usually easily recognize the artifacts and
carry on tuning (for extreme case of the blurring, see Fig. C.5 (d)).
Moreover, presence of the artifacts does not imply that tuned qubit will
be lousy, on the contrary – quantum dot systems well isolated from
electron bath in the leads tend to have longer relaxation times and be
better behaved, as the exchange of electron (or spin) with the leads
becomes dramatically suppressed.

#### c.5 Applying control pulses while acquiring charge diagrams

Sometimes in the experiments there is a need to search for certain spots
with long relaxation time within the charge diagram. Typically the goal
is to find a spin blockade or a good measurement point within a
spin-blocked triangle (Fig. C.6 (b)). In such case there is a need to
measure a charge diagram where each pixel represents the value of the
measurement performed at this point at the end of certain sequence of
pulses.

The convenient hack is to apply a desired pulse using the AWG while
acquiring a charge diagram (Fig. C.6 (a)), with a real-time technique or
in a standard way. If the RF carrier is switched on only when voltages
are set to the measurement point the regions with long relaxation time
should show up in the charge diagram. The signal acquired throughout the
rest of the pulse cycle contributes only to the background noise.
Increased averaging allows to compensate for this background.

There are four additional notes that have to be made on this topic.
First, to obtain charge diagrams of good quality the measurement time
should be long ,relative to the total pulse length. I recommend to keep
it above 50%.

Second, the application of the fast pulses results in additional
artifacts. They appear whenever any of the steps the pulse goes across a
transition with small tunneling rate. Therefore you need to pay
additional attention and make sure that the designed pulse does not
cross such charge transition whenever measurement is performed within
interesting region.

Third, if the sawtooth wave period is close to the integer number of
pulse periods a strong stripes might appear on the charge diagram, that
will dominate the entire measurement (weak diagonal stripes can be seen
in Fig. C.6 (b)). In such case one needs to change the length of the
pulse a little bit (a few hundred nanoseconds is usually enough).

Fourth, the average voltage within a singleperiod of pulse needs to be
0. This is because DC voltage drop across the bias tees on the sample
board, that may cause heating of the fridge. It is convenient to set
voltage on Tektronix AWG to 0 at the measurement point. Otherwise you
will observe apparent shifts of the charge diagram, which might be
tedious to calibrate out.

### Appendix D Remote control of multiple arbitrary waveform generators

"Documentation is like sex: When it’s good, it’s amazing, and when it’s
bad it’s still better than nothing." - Eli Levinson-Falk

Edward Laird citing Eli Levinson-Falk in the beginning of the Igor
procedure file containing drivers for Tektronix 5014c AWG to justify the
state of documentation.

In this chapter you will find instructions how to use Igor Pro
procedures I rewrote to control multiple Tektronix 5014c arbitrary
waveform generators (based on older code by Edward Laird, Christian
Barthel, Jim Medford and others). In section D.1 I will introduce the
features available through graphical interface, introduce most useful
commands and point to some important places in the code. In the section
D.2 I will dive deeper into the structure of the code, explaining the
features that are less obvious but need to be remembered.

#### d.1 User’s guide

##### d.1.1 Initialization

The code controlling the AWGs (excluding measurement procedures) is
contained in three procedure files:

-                   MultipleAWG5014.ipf                – contains
    definitions of GUI and some high level functions

-                   MultipleAWG5014_PulseProcedures.ipf                –
    contains most of the procedures for uploading pulses, sequences,
    compensation of high-pass filters etc.

-                   LowLevelAWG5014Control.ipf                –
    low-level driver for communication with AWGs, adopted from Christian
    Barthel’s code to communicate with multiple AWGs.

Compiling them requires cleaning the experiment file from the old legacy
code for control of Tektronix 510, 720 and single 5014. You might also
need to create two symbolic paths for saving pulses and sequences (Sec.
D.1.7 ).

Once the code is compiling initialize the GUI by calling

    ¯initAWG(n)

where              n             is the number of AWGs you will be
using. This will create several panels that I will describe in a second.
For now you care about the main panel (titled
             AWG5014panel             ). Set the IP addresses of the
AWGs and the port number (you can find or change it on AWG in
             system\GPIB/LAN configuration             menu).

Depending on the Igor code version you need then to press
             Initialize VISA             or call
             initVISA()             first. If no errors are thrown the
communication to the AWGs is now established.

However before you proceed you need to know one thing. The values of the
parameters you see now in the GUI (which I will describe in a second)
are the values stored locally. If you connected AWG for the first time
or restarted it they do not match the real settings until you change
them through GUI. For this reason I recommend to control AWG only via
Igor interface, to make sure the values stored in Igor match values that
are really set.

##### d.1.2 Main panel

The main panel (Fig. D.1 ) provides easy access to main settings of each
AWG and is mostly self-explanatory.              General             tab
allows to control all of the AWGs simultaneously. In particular from
here you can resize pulse and sequence table, and upload designed pulse
(mode              Continuous             or
             Triggered             ) or sequence (mode
             Sequence             ). If you wish to rearrange pulses in
the sequence you can modify sequence table without the need to upload
all pulses (section D.1.8 ). You can also turn all outputs on/off and
start running the waveform ¹ ¹ 1 Note: Running the waveform and turning
outputs on first time after uploading the sequence can take a few
seconds. This might cause errors when you run the first measurement
after uploading the sequence .              Add input            
controls whether signal supplied to the rear input will be added to the
waveform (this is useful for fast acquisition of charge diagrams;
chapter C ). Buttons on the right allow to reopen remaining windows and
tables.

Other tabs allow to control each AWG separately. Here you can reupload
pulse or sequence to single channel (only if length of the pulse and
sequence table was not changed) and control trigger and marker channels.

Should you need to reopen the main panel simply call:

    ¯AWG5014panel()
    ¯buildAWGpanelTabs(n)
    ¯setAWGtab("whatever",0)

where              n             is number of AWGs you use.

##### d.1.3 Uploading pulses

Once we familiarized ourselves with the main panel it is time to upload
and run our first pulse. Let’s take a look at the pulse table and
corresponding pulse shape (Fig. D.2 ). The rows of the table correspond
to segments of the pulse. Each of the segments you can label with a few
character string. Segments labeled              D             and
             M             play a special role (which I’ll mention
later) and therefore you should avoid using labels starting with D or M
for other segments. Each segment lasts for time specified in nanoseconds
in next column. Be aware that inserting time that is not a multiple of
AWG clock cycle may sometimes cause troubles. Columns labeled
             ch #/$             indicate voltage (in milivolts ) that
will be outputted during this segment on channel
             $             of AWG number              #             ² ²
2 The indices always go in a descending hierarchy: AWG number first,
channel number second, marker number third (if needed) . If the
             Ramp             is nonzero it indicates the length of the
sweep to the specified voltage.

The example of the pulse created with a pulse table is on the bottom of
the Fig. D.2 . It consists of a few steps, each labeled according to the
pulse table. In particular notice that step              L            
(time 20000, ramp 10000) consists of 10 @xmath s sweep from 0 to @xmath
8 mV and 10 @xmath s waiting time at @xmath 8 mV, so ramp time is
included in the total segment time. Next segment (
             PPM             ) shows that even more clearly – entire
segment is a sweep.

Final columns titled              m#$%             set the marker
             %             of channel              $             , AWG
number              #             to low (value 0) or high (value 1). In
this example marker is turned on during              PM            
(reference measurement) and              M             (measurement)
segments to turn on RF carrier and trigger the Alazar card (so in fact
only two markers are used) ³ ³ 3 Side note: notice that there is
additional 1 @xmath s waiting time introduced between
                PM                and                 M                .
This is because the Alazar card needs to have clear slope to trigger on.
So if marker is switched off for just 150 ns there is a risk that
trigger will be missed. .

Once you prepared pulse table set mode of the AWGs to
             Continuous             or
             Triggered             and press
             Upload all             .

##### d.1.4 Correcting for attenuation and delays

By now you might have noticed two parameters in the GUI that do not have
counterparts in the settings of AWG, that is
             Divider             and              Delay             .
These are software corrections for attenuation and (large) difference in
length of the coax lines.

The divider is factor that will multiply the value which is set in the
pulsetable ( not in dB). The goal here is to choose this factor to be
equal to the attenuation of the fast lines. Once you do that, the
voltage specified in the pulse table will correspond to the actual
voltage on the sample. To estimate the divider factor upload small
(let’s say mV, period 10-100 @xmath s) square pulse on one of the gates
and run it while acquiring a charge diagram. All charge transitions
should become doubled, and the distance between two images will
correspond to the actual amplitude of the square pulse on the gate. Now
insert divider, upload square pulse again and repeat until you reach
satisfying accuracy. In our example (Figs. D.1 and D.2 ) we see that
during segment              S             we want to apply @xmath mV on
gate connected to ch 1/1. However estimated divider id 17.5. This means
that the voltage on the output of the AWG will be set to @xmath mV
@xmath mV.

The delay parameter can be used to compensate for large (>1 ns)
differences in the length of the fast lines. In practice difference
between length of coaxes is much smaller and should be corrected by
adjusting the skew (directly on AWG, not added to GUI). However it is
necessary if you use some of the AWG channels to pulse on the gates and
other to modulate the RF. If delay on any of the channels is nonzero the
software will insert additional segment in the beginning/end of each
pulse, when the voltage is 0. And so if length of the cables delays
modulated RF signal by 20 ns you need to insert +20 in the corresponding
window. Notice that the delay is introduced by adding additional waiting
time in the beginning and/or at the end of each pulse therefore you need
to design a pulse in such a way, that this will not introduce artifacts
in the measurements.

In fact there is one more in-software correction: correction for
high-pass filtering of the fast lines. This feature is not implemented
in the interface – the cutoff frequency is hardcoded but can be modified
in              compilePulseTable()             function (Subsec. D.2.5
).

##### d.1.5 Special role of D and M segments in compensation of
high-pass filtering

Speaking of proper design of pulse and high-pass filtering it is time to
discuss convention considering pulse shapes and segments labeled
             D             and              M             . What you
would probably like is for the volage on gates to be equal to DC set by
DAC whenever you set 0 in the pulsetable. Therefore you must be aware of
high-pass filtering (by the bias-tees). Effectively it will shift the
average voltage throughout the pulse to 0 (that is to DC value set by
DAC) and cause heating effects. On the other it is very often convenient
to keep the measurement point              M             at values set
by DAC, and therefore all AWG channels output 0 during this segment. To
solve this issue it is convenient to introduce additional segment
             D             (choice of letter D is arbitrary and is
hardcoded in the software). It’s duration is set to fixed percentage of
the pulse length (set in the code, as I will describe in subsection
D.2.4 ) and amplitude is adjusted to set the average voltage throughout
the pulse to 0. By convention segment              D             in the
beginning of the pulse, just after the measurement
             M             and before initialization. The point is for
to reinitialize the system after the              D             pulse so
it would not affect the experiment.

There is one more issue related to high-pass filtering, which is related
to the fact that while AWG is not running or waiting for trigger (while
the outputs are on) it does output the voltage. This will be the voltage
equal to the first/last point in the sequence (depending on whether
             First point when waiting             check box is checked
in the GUI, Fig. D.1 (bottom)). Within the convention in which
             D             point is first and              M            
point is last (and all voltages are equal 0) the checkbox need to remain
unchecked, which will make AWG output 0 while it’s waiting to run.

##### d.1.6 Modifying a pulse from the command line

In the code I define a special function that can be used to modify
pulses from the command line

    ¯setpulseparameter(idStr, value)

It’s syntax is analogous to              setval             function.
String              idStr             specifies parameter that will be
modified and              value             is it’s new value. There are
a few fundamental predefined              idStr             parameters,
which begin with letters              t             ,
             v             ,              r             and
             m             . Their function is the following:

-                   "t<label>"                sets time of the segment
                    <label>                to
                    value                nanoseconds

-                   "v#$<label>"                sets voltage on AWG
                    #                , channel
                    $                during the segment
                    <label>                to
                    value                milivolts

-                   "r<label>"                sets ramp time of the
    segment                 <label>                to
                    value                nanoseconds

-                   "m#$%<label>"                sets marker
                    %                on AWG
                    #                , channel
                    $                during the segment
                    <label>                to
                    value               

There is also one special              idStr="mAll"             which
sets all markers to              value             during entire pulse.

Now you might want to specify your own parameter to modify, which is a
complex combination of parameters above. To do that you need to get into
the code: find definition of
             setpulseparameter()             function and conditional
tree starting with the line:

    ¯if(stringmatch(idStr[0],"t")||stringmatch(idStr[0],"v")||
    ¯                    stringmatch(idStr[0],"r")||stringmatch(idStr[0],"m"))

You can add you entry in this tree. For example you can add such
commands:

    ¯elseif(stringmatch(idStr[0,2],"det"))
    ¯    setpulseparameter("v11"+idStr[3,sEnd], -value)
    ¯    setpulseparameter("v12"+idStr[3,sEnd], value)

This will add possibility of calling, for example

    ¯setpulseparameter("detS",20)

from the command line. This will set the voltage on channel 1 of AWG 1
during segment              S             to @xmath mV and voltage on
channel 2 of AWG 1 during segment              S             to @xmath
mV (that is: it will apply such changes to the pulsetable).

Syntax introduced here will be relevant later, for definitions of pulse
sequences.

##### d.1.7 Saving and loading pulses

Once you define a fancy pulsetable you will probably like to save it and
be able to use at later point in the experiment. For that you can use a
             Pulse panel             (Fig. D.3 ; it can be opened from
the main tab on AWG panel D.1 ). It’s quite self explanatory. Just
remember that              Delete             button removes highlighted
pulse without a warning.

Technical detail is that each column of the pulsetable is stored as a
wave, and all waves corresponding to a single pulse are saved in a
single Igor text file (              .itx             ).

Pulses will be saved in the symbolic path
             pulses             , which I suggest to locate in
             <experiment_file_location>\pulses\             . Panel
identical to this one can be used to save sequences in symbolic path
             sequences             (suggested location:
             <experiment_file_location>\sequences\             .)

##### d.1.8 Sequences

More complex function of the AWG is application of a sequence of pulses.
First a set of waveforms is uploaded to AWG, then they are arranged in
certain order. Once this is done the AWG can execute the sequence.

To create a sequence we need to take at the final element of the GUI –
             Sequencetable             (Fig. D.4 ). This table specifies
how pulses will be arranged in a sequence and whether they should be
modified in any way.

First column –              Pulse             – gives the name of the
pulse. This name corresponds to the name of the file in the pulse panel.
In case this field is left empty (which is usually the case) currently
modified pulsetable is used.

Second column specifies what modifications should be done to the pulse.
The operation code is a string that has a form of
             <idStr>_<value>             . When the sequence is compiled
the software will take specified pulse and call
             setpulseparameter("<idstr>",<value>)             .

Third columns will specifies how many times the pulse should be repeated
before moving on to executing the next line of the
             sequencetable             .

Fourth column tells whether the AWG should wait for the trigger before
outputting this pulse.

Final columns specifies to which line in a sequence table to move after
executing this line of a              sequencetable             . This
is slightly confusing because Igor labels rows of the
             sequencetable             from 0, while AWG starts with 1.
The convention is this: value 0 means – execute next line of a
             sequencetable             . Any number @xmath larger than 0
means – execute line @xmath , which is labeled in Igor as @xmath .

Knowing this conventions you can define sequence manually. However this
is impractical, because usually sequences in spin-qubit experiments
(perhaps also other) look like one specified in
             sequencetable             in Fig. D.4 . First a single
pulse runs over and over again while communication with other devices
takes place. This pulse has all markers turned off, not to trigger any
measurement. Than series of pulses is applied, which differ only by
value of one parameter. In this case detuning during separation point (
             detS             ). The              Go to            
value of the last pulse in the sequence points is set to 2 so AWG stays
in a loop, outputting the pulses with various
             detS             over and over again.

Such              sequencetable             can be created using the
function

    ¯buildsequencetable("<pulse_name>","<idStr>",from,to,steps)

which has similar structure to              do1d()             function.
Here              <pulse_name>             is the basic pulse – this
name will appear everywhere in the first column of the
             sequencetable             .              idStr            
indicates the parameter which will be modified in this sequence.
             from             and              to             are limits
within which              idStr             will be changed and
             steps             specifies how many different values
should it take (in fact there will be              steps             +1
values).

For example the              sequencetable             in Fig. D.4 was
created by calling

    ¯buildsequencetable("","detS",0,10,10)

You can make more subtle adjustments, for example whether to wait for
trigger before outputting each pulse, how many times to repeat the first
pulse etc. by modifying the code (which will be described in second part
of this chapter).

#### d.2 Code

##### d.2.1 Basic structure

The code was not written systematically however it has quite logical
internal structure. In this section I will describe this structure and
show certain key points, where crucial procedures and parameters are
defined.

The basic structure of the code, with GUI as a root, is shown in Fig.
D.5 . The most important part of the code is
             uploadToAWG()             function which handles clicks of
the              Upload all             button and calls subroutines
responsible for compilation and uploading of pulses (Subsec. D.2.2 ) and
sequences (Subsec. D.2.3 ). I’ll describe those procedures in detail
throughout this section.

Except for that GUI has several elements that instantly change settings
of AWG. The functions that handle relevant events call low level
functions communicating with AWGs and change local variables that store
information about the setup of AWG. These functions are simple and
therefore I’ll not describe them here. However I remind – because
information of the AWG setup is stored locally, in certain situations
the settings presented on the GUI may differ from actual settings of
AWGs.

In addition to this basic functionality there are a few additional
loosely connected procedures for building a sequence table,
visualization of the pulse shape etc. They are very handy, and I’ll
describe them in the end of the chapter.

##### d.2.2 Function: uploadPulse(AWGNum, chan[, quiet])

The purpose of this function is to upload a pulse to a single channel in
             Continuous             or
             Triggered             mode. It performs the following steps
(Fig. D.6 ):

######

It removes old waveform from the AWG. Importantly it removes only
waveform that was previously outputted on this channel in
              Continuous              or
              Triggered              mode. This means that whatever
sequence was uploaded before remains stored on the AWG and can be
”activated” by switching back to               Sequence             
mode. As you’ll find out by yourself, it allows to save a lot of time on
uploading of the sequence.

######

Time and voltages during               D              point in the
active pulsetable are adjusted by calling
              correctionD(background=0)              (Subsec. D.2.4 ).

######

It compiles the pulse to wave of floating numbers between @xmath and
@xmath , in which each cell corresponds to a single clock cycle of the
AWG. The relevant function is called
              compilePulseTable(AWGNum, chan, background=0)             
(Subsec. D.2.5 ).

######

It turns the wave into binary and sends ready waveform to the proper AWG
naming it               Igor_ch$              where
              $              is a channel number by calling
              sendPulseToAWG(AWGNum, chanm "Igor")              (Subsec.
D.2.8 ).

######

The AWG is commanded to output the waveform on the designated channel.

##### d.2.3 Function: uploadSequence(AWGNum, chan[, quiet])

This function is more branched than one for uploading pulses (Fig. D.7 )
and consists of the following parts:

######

The function removes old waveforms from AWGs. If pulses are uploaded to
all channels nothing is left behind. This is because communication with
AWG is relatively slow, so browsing a list of waveforms and removing
them one by one would be very inefficient.

######

All pulses the sequence consists of are uploaded to the memory of the
AWG with function
              uploadPulsesForSequence(AWGNum, chan)             
(Subsec. D.2.10 ).

######

Sequencetable is converted to the series of commands which are sent to
AWGs by calling               sendSequenceTable(AWGNum)             
(Subsec. D.2.11 ). The commands arrange waveforms uploaded to AWG in
sequence.

##### d.2.4 Function: correctionD([background])

The purpose of function is to adjust time and voltage during the pulse
segment              D             to set the mean voltage during the
pulse to zero. The time of segment              D             in set to
be a fixed fraction of the elength of the entire pulse by a set of
commands:

    ¯// set time of D point to 0 and calculate total time
    ¯setPulseParameter("tD",0,background=background)
    ¯variable totTime = sum(AWGt)

    ¯// set initial time of D pulse to ##% of pulse time
    ¯NVAR AWGfreq = root:malina:AWGfreq
    ¯variable timeD = round(totTime/2*AWGfreq)/AWGfreq
    ¯setPulseParameter("tD",timeD,background=background)

In this case line
             variable timeD = round(totTime/2*AWGfreq)/AWGfreq            
(factor 2) will set the segment              D             to last 1/3
of the total length of the pulse. If you wish to adjust the length of
the              D             point here is where you should make
modifications. The purpose of the multiplication by
             AWGfreq             , rounding and division is to guarantee
that the time of the segment              D             will be a
multiple of the AWG clock cycle.

##### d.2.5 Function: compilePulseTable(AWGNum, chan[, background])

This function main function is to pass parameters of a pulse (just
single channel) from pulsetable to
             AWGmakewaveform             function. However it also adds
segments in the beginning and/or at the of the pulse to introduce delay
specified by the user in the GUI.

######

First, the waves containing columns of pulse table are copied to locally
created waves. To these two segments are added, in the beginning and in
the end. In these segments all voltages and markers are set to, and
their duration is adjusted based on delays for all channels.

######

Waves storing the pulse table are passed to
              AWGmakewaveform()              function (Subsec. D.2.6 ),
which creates in the memory two waves, one for waveform (normalized to
@xmath 1 based on               Vpp              set for a channel) and
second for markers (points have values 0, 1, 2 or 3, to represent 2 bits
– for 1st and 2nd marker).

######

Functions for high- and low-pass correction are called ⁴ ⁴ 4 I was not
using correction for low-pass filtering, so I am not aware whether it’s
functioning is correct . Here the time constants of the filters are
hardcoded. This relevant piece of code goes like this (Subsec. D.2.7 ):

    ¯// invert high-pass and low-pass filters
    ¯variable highpass = 2.7e6 // time constant of the high-pass filter in ns
    ¯variable lowpass = 0
    ¯if(highpass != 0)
    ¯    inverthighpass(highpass*1e-9, igorPulse, "arbinv")
    ¯    duplicate/o $"arbinv" $("root:malina:pulses:Igor_AWG_"+num2str(AWGNum)+
    ¯¯                                                     "_ch"+num2str(chan))
    ¯    KillWaves $"arbinv"
    ¯endif
    ¯if(lowpass != 0)
    ¯    invertLowpass(lowpass, igorPulse, "arbinv")
    ¯    duplicate/o $"arbinv" $("root:malina:pulses:Igor_AWG_"+num2str(AWGNum)+
    ¯¯                                                     "_ch"+num2str(chan))
    ¯    KillWaves $"arbinv"
    ¯endif

##### d.2.6 Function: AWGmakewaveform (AWGNum, chan, arbstr, markstr,
tw, rw, hw, mw1, mw2)

This function waveform (normalized to @xmath 1 based on
             Vpp             set for a channel) and marker-wave (points
have values 0, 1, 2 or 3, to represent 2 bits – for 1st and 2nd marker).
             AWGNum             and              chan             need
to be specified, since              Vpp             and
             divider             can be specified differently for each
channel.              arbstr             and
             markstr             are names of the waves that will be
created in the memory.              tw             ,
             rw             ,              hw             ,
             mw1             ,              mw2             are the
waves with the parameters read from the pulsetable.

             AWGmakewaveform()             function performs the
following steps:

######

Reads               AWGFreq              ,
              Vpp              and               divider             
from the global variables.

######

Calculates number of clock cycles for each segment and ramp.

######

Calculates whether the pulse has the minimum length of 256 points. If
not, repeats the same pulse many tames in a single waveform.

######

Calculates voltage and 2-bit value of the marker wave for each clock
cycle.

######

Normalizes the voltage according to the               Vpp              .

##### d.2.7 Function: inverthighpass(tau, inputPulse, finalPulseName)

The purpose of the              inverthighpass()             function is
to correct the pulse shape, for the high pass filter on the bias-tee.
Essentially it applies a transformation:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (D.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here @xmath is voltage during @xmath -th clock cycle, @xmath , @xmath is
the time constant of the high pass filter and @xmath is the mean voltage
during the pulse.

Under assumption that @xmath this reverses the filtering perfectly.
Typically @xmath ns and @xmath ms so this condition is easily fulfilled.

##### d.2.8 Function: sendPulseToAWG(AWGNum, chan, name)

This function reads compiled waveform for single channel and markerwave
and passes it to              awg5014sendPatternToWList()            
for uploading. Here also the name of the uploaded waveform file is
defined.

##### d.2.9 Function: awg5014sendPatternToWList(AWGNum, filename,
arbwave, markwave)

Low-level              awg5014sendPatternToWList()             function
converts the waveform and markerwave to the binary format, which can be
efficiently sent to the AWG. More precisely each Voltage and marker
value at each step is converted to two 8-bit integers (14 bits for
voltage and 2 bits for markers) according to the following recipe.

    ¯binarywave[2*i] = round((arbwave[i]+1)*(2^13))&255
    ¯                     //first 8 bits of 14-bit representation of arbwave
    ¯binarywave[2*j+1] =
    ¯          (round((arbwave[i]+1)*(2^13))&(2^8+2^9+2^10+2^11+2^12+2^13))/255
    ¯          +(markWave[i]&1)*2^6+(markWave[i]&2)/2*2^7
    ¯                     //remaining 6 arbwave and 2 bits of markerwave

Than new waveform is created on AWG and
             binarywave             is sent using
             AWGVisaWriteBinary()             function.

##### d.2.10 Function: uploadPulsesForSequence(AWGNum, chan[,
sequenceName])

This function essentially executes procedure identical to
             uploadPulse()             function in a loop for every line
of the sequence table.

In every iteration it looks at the row of the sequence table, copies an
appropriate pulse table to the temporary waves, applies an operation
that modifies the pulse table according to the codeword (Sec. D.1.6 ),
applies              correctionD()             , compiles with
             compilePulseTable()             and uploads with
             sendPulseToAWG()             under a name created based on
the codeword.

In case the name of the base pulse does not match any of the saved pulse
tables it searches through the list of the saved sequences and calls
itself with the subsequence name as an optional argument. This enables
to iteratively upload all of the pulses for the subsequence.

##### d.2.11 Function: sendSequenceTable(AWGNum)

Once all of the pulses of a sequence are uploaded with
             uploadPulsesForSequence()             function they are
arranged in a sequence by calling this function. Essentially it loops
through the rows in a sequence table and sends a series of binary
commands to AWG specifying the waveform name, number of repetitions etc.
for each element in a sequence. To slightly increase the speed commands
ares first memorized in a strings of @xmath commands which are sent with
             AWGVisaWriteBinary()             .

##### d.2.12 Function: showpulse(channels)

             Showpulse()             function allows to plot waveforms
defined in a pulsetable. For example calling
             showpulse("11;12")             will plot waveforms for
channels 1 and 2 of AWG 1. This is how the plot in Fig. D.2 was created
(except for background shading and segment labels).

##### d.2.13 Function: annotateshape(xcent, ycent, xchan, ychan)

This function visualises the pulse shape as arrows on a charge diagram.
Parameters              xchan             and
             ychan             (which are strings consisting of two
digits) choose which AWG channels should be visualised on, respectively,
horizontal and vertical axis. Parameters              xchan            
and              ychan             indicate DC voltages on a charge
diagram, which will correspond to 0 voltage on corresponding AWG
channel. Special case is              xchan=0             or
             ychan=0             which will result in visualisation of
the pulse in the center of the charge diagram.
