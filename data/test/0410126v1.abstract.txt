To recapitulate, the generalized Mixmaster dynamics that we have
discussed in this section can be described by the following limits:

  -- -- -------- -- -------
        @xmath      (282)
        @xmath      (283)
        @xmath      (284)
        @xmath      (285)
  -- -- -------- -- -------

Unlike the case of standard Mixmaster dynamics discussed in Section 10 ,
to date no proofs have been given concerning generalized Mixmaster
dynamics (e.g. the limits ( 282 )–( 284 ) which serve to restrict the
past attractor). The non-tilted Bianchi VI @xmath solutions and the
tilted Bianchi II solutions are prototypes for the new features of
generalized Mixmaster dynamics. Understanding these two special cases,
and having our formulation of the evolution equations for the whole
hierarchy, gives qualitative information about the dynamics of the whole
class and provides equations for doing detailed analyses, and perhaps
for providing proofs of some of the above limits.
