In this thesis we investigate cosmological models more general than the
isotropic and homogeneous Friedmann-Lema√Ætre models. We focus on
cosmologies with one spatial degree of freedom, whose matter content
consists of a perfect fluid and the cosmological constant. We formulate
the Einstein field equations as a system of quasilinear first order
partial differential equations, using scale-invariant variables.

The primary goal is to study the dynamics in the two asymptotic regimes,
i.e. near the initial singularity and at late times. We highlight the
role of spatially homogeneous dynamics as the background dynamics, and
analyze the inhomogeneous aspect of the dynamics. We perform a variety
of numerical simulations to support our analysis and to explore new
phenomena.
