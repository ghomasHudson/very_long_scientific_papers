#### The Ferrara-Lledò proposal

In [ 52 ] the authors consider the problem of generalizing Moyal product
( 1.32 ) to @xmath @xmath superspace. This is described by the set of
superspace coordinates @xmath , where @xmath are four real bosonic
coordinates and @xmath , @xmath are two–component complex Weyl fermions.
The conjugation rule @xmath follows from the requirement to have a four
component Majorana fermion (we use conventions of Superspace [ 24 ] ).
In the standard (anti)commutative superspace the algebra of the
coordinates is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (1.81)
  -- -------- -- --------

and it is trivially covariant under the superPoincaré group. The
subgroup of the classical (super)translations (spacetime translations
and supersymmetry transformations)

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (1.82)
  -- -------- -- --------

is generated by two complex charges @xmath ( @xmath ) and the
four–momentum @xmath subjected to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.83)
  -- -------- -- --------

Representations of supersymmetry are given by superfields @xmath whose
components are obtained by expanding @xmath in powers of the spinorial
coordinates. The set of superfields is closed under the standard product
of functions. The product of two superfields is (anti)commutative,
@xmath , and associative, @xmath . The set of superspace covariant
derivatives is given by @xmath . In both this section and the following
one (so in the papers [ 52 ] and [ 26 ] ) the nonchiral representation
of supersymmetry has been chosen, where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.84)
  -- -------- -- --------

Superspace geometry is nontrivial, because of the presence of a
nonvanishing torsion

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.85)
  -- -------- -- --------

To extend the construction of Moyal product to superspace, one has first
to introduce a superspace Poisson structure generalizing ( 1.20 ). The
authors propose

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.86)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are constant matrices. This Poisson structure is
manifestly covariant with respect to supersymmetry. Moreover, it is
associative since it involves only @xmath and @xmath and not @xmath .
Associativity would be broken if the whole set of superspace covariant
derivatives had appeared, because of the nontrivial superspace torsion (
1.85 ). With this Poisson structure the authors construct a Moyal-like
product in superspace as follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.87)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is an associative product, as one can easily deduce by extending to
superspace the discussion in section 1.1.1.

If we consider the special case when the superfields @xmath and @xmath
are identified with the supercoordinates themselves, we obtain the
following anticommutation relations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.88)
     @xmath      (1.89)
  -- -------- -- --------

They are not consistent with the @xmath @xmath superspace conjugation
relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.90)
  -- -------- -- --------

Even if in principle a noncommutative deformation is not required to
respect the complex structure present on the original space, the
relation ( 1.90 ) is needed in the original space for the fermionic
degrees of freedom to be equal to the bosonic ones. By relaxing it in
the deformation, one modifies (doubles) the number of supersymmetries.

In the paper [ 52 ] it was also observed that the class of chiral
superfields, defined by the relation @xmath , is not closed under the
product ( 1.87 ). Already at first order in the @xmath expansion
nontrivial terms arise in @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath are both
chiral, because of the nontrivial superspace torsion ( 1.85 ). Since the
simplest superspace field theories are written in terms of chiral
superfields, the lack of closure for the chiral class is a serious
obstruction in constructing deformations of known supersymmetric
theories.

#### 1.1.6 Non(anti)commutative superspace

In this section I will discuss the results that I obtained in [ 26 ] ,
in collaboration with D. Klemm and S. Penati, regarding supersymmetric
associative deformations of @xmath @xmath Minkowski and @xmath euclidean
superspace.

##### Supersymmetric deformations of @xmath @xmath superpace

In [ 26 ] , a more systematical approach with respect to [ 52 ] has been
followed to determine the most general non(anti)commutative geometry in
@xmath four dimensional superspace, invariant under the classical
supertranslation group and associative. As I have anticipated before,
the deformation will be required to preserve the complex conjugation
relations that are valid in ordinary superspace.

We will consider the supercoordinates @xmath , generically satisfying
the non(anti)commutative algebra

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.91)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have introduced the (anti)commutator

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.92)
  -- -------- -- --------

that is a commutator if at least one of the two indices @xmath , @xmath
is a vector and an anticommutator otherwise.

Let us consider the transformation @xmath . This is the generic symmetry
of the ordinary theory that we would like to preserve in the
deformation. Exactly as in the bosonic case discussed in section 1.1.2,
we will require that the functional dependence of the
non(anti)commutative algebra is not modified under the transformation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.93)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since, as discussed in section 1.1.1, bosonic noncommutative
deformations break “particle” Lorentz invariance, we will not worry
about this symmetry in our superspace generalization. We will only take
into consideration the supertranslation group, containing ordinary
bosonic translations and supersymmetry transformations. For @xmath
@xmath superspace conventions, we refer to [ 24 ] (see summary in the
previous section).

In order to define a non(anti)commutative superspace, we consider the
most general structure of the algebra for a set of four bosonic real
coordinates and a complex two–component Weyl spinor with @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (1.94)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here, @xmath are local functions of the superspace variables and we have
defined @xmath , @xmath . From the conjugation rules for the coordinates
it follows also @xmath and @xmath .

To implement ( 1.94 ) to be the algebra of the coordinates of a
non(anti)commutative @xmath superspace we require its invariance under
the group of space translations and supertranslations ( 1.82 ). As
before, we restrict our analysis to the case of an undeformed group
where the parameters @xmath , @xmath and @xmath in ( 1.82 ) are kept
(anti)commuting ² ² 2 More general constructions of non(anti)commutative
geometries in grassmannian spaces have been considered, where also the
algebra of the parameters is deformed [ 50 ] . .

As in the bosonic case discussed in section 1.1.1, we require the
functional dependence of the @xmath in ( 1.94 ) to be the same at any
point of the supermanifold. To work out explicitly the constraints which
follow, we perform a (super)translation ( 1.82 ) on the coordinates and
compute the algebra of the new coordinates in terms of the old ones. We
find that the functions appearing in ( 1.94 ) are constrained by the
following set of independent equations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.95)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.96)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
                 (1.97)
  -- -------- -- --------

together with their hermitian conjugates.

Looking for the most general local solution brings us to the following
algebra for a non(anti)commutative geometry in Minkowski superspace
consistent with (super)translations

  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      (1.98)
  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.99)
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (1.100)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are constant functions.

We note that, while invariance under spacetime translations necessarily
requires the non(anti)commutation functions to be independent of the
@xmath coordinates, as we have seen in section 1.1.1, invariance under
supersymmetry is less restrictive and allows for a particular dependence
on the spinorial coordinates.

On the algebra of smooth functions of superspace variables we can
formally define a graded bracket which reproduces the fundamental
algebra ( 1.98 ) when applied to the coordinates. In the case of bosonic
Minkowski spacetime, the noncommutative algebra ( 1.80 ) can be obtained
by interpreting the l.h.s. of this relation as the Poisson bracket of
classical commuting variables, where, for generic functions of
spacetime, the Poisson bracket is defined as @xmath . Generalizing to
Minkowski superspace, the graded bracket must be constructed as a
bidifferential operator with respect to the superspace variables. Using
covariant derivatives @xmath , for generic functions @xmath and @xmath
of the superspace coordinates we define the bidifferential operator

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.101)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.102)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is a constant graded symplectic supermatrix satisfying @xmath , @xmath
denoting the grading of @xmath . It is easy to verify that applying this
operator to the superspace coordinates we obtain ( 1.98 ).

Alternatively, one can express the graded brackets ( 1.101 ) in terms of
torsion free, noncovariant spinorial derivatives @xmath so obtaining a
matrix @xmath explicitly dependent on @xmath . The bracket ( 1.101 ) is
rewritten as follows

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.103)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.104)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and the functions @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are given in ( 1.100 ).

The latter formulation of the graded bracket is not manifestly
covariant, but it is however very useful, since it makes clear that
Kontsevich procedure outlined in section 1.1.4 can be generalized to
superspace to construct an associative deformation of the product
between superfields. All the results from now on can be written in both
ways. In general the covariant formulation is preferred because it
naturally leads to a geometrical interpretation of the results.

##### Deformation of the supersymmetry algebra

It is important to note that the non(anti)commutative extension given in
( 1.98 ) in general deforms the supersymmetry algebra. In the standard
case, defining @xmath , the supersymmetry algebra can be written as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (1.105)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the torsion of the flat superspace ( @xmath are the only
nonzero components). Turning on non(anti)commutativity in superspace
leads instead to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (1.106)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is still the torsion of the flat superspace, while

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.107)
  -- -------- -- ---------

( @xmath means antisymmetrization when at least one of the indices is a
vector index, symmetrization otherwise) is a curvature tensor whose
presence is a direct consequence of the non(anti)commutation of the
grassmannian coordinates. Its nonvanishing components are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (1.108)
  -- -------- -- ---------

I would like to stress that the curvature terms deforming the
supersymmetry algebra are quadratic in bosonic derivatives and have no
effect on the supercoordinate-algebra. Therefore their presence is not
in disagreement with consistency of the supercoordinate algebra with
supersymmetry.

Since the terms proportional to the curvature in ( 1.106 ) are quadratic
in supersymmetry charges and covariant derivatives, we can define new
graded brackets

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.109)
                 (1.110)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and analogous ones for @xmath and @xmath , which satisfy the standard
algebra ( 1.105 ). The new brackets can be interpreted as a quantum
deformation associated to a @xmath –parameter which in this case is a
rank–four tensor

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.111)
  -- -------- -- ---------

##### Associativity and the geometry of deformed superspace

Given the bidifferential operator ( 1.101 ) associated to the
noncommutative supergeometry defined in ( 1.98 ) it is easy to prove the
following identities

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (1.112)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The operator @xmath will then be promoted to a graded Poisson structure
on superspace if and only if Jacobi identities hold

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (1.113)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for any triplet of functions of superspace variables. This property is
equivalent to associativity of the fundamental algebra ( 1.98 ). Since
the latter is nontrivial (coordinate-dependent commutators appear), (
1.113 ) is not in general satisfied. Indeed, imposing ( 1.113 ) yields
the nontrivial conditions

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (1.114)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.115)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the torsion @xmath and the curvature @xmath have been introduced
in ( 1.105 ) and ( 1.106 ). Equation ( 1.114 ) is the covariant
superspace generalization of bosonic associativity constraint ( 1.70 )
(the analogy with ( 1.70 ) is clearer when it is rewritten in terms of
the “noncovariant” Poisson structure @xmath given in ( 1.103 )).

As in bosonic case, if @xmath is invertible ( @xmath ), equation ( 1.114
) is equivalent to the vanishing of the contorsion tensor @xmath defined
by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.116)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This is the superspace generalization of ( 1.72 ), in terms of
manifestly covariant quantities. The only nonvanishing components of
@xmath are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (1.117)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We notice that its bosonic components @xmath vanish due to the @xmath
–independence of the noncommutation functions in ( 1.98 ). The
nonvanishing of @xmath comes entirely from the @xmath –dependence of the
functions in ( 1.100 ). As will be explained in section 1.3, it has been
shown that bosonic coordinate-dependent deformations naturally emerge in
string theory in the presence of curved backgrounds. Nonassociative
deformations also emerge and the parameter governing nonassociativity is
a bosonic three form @xmath . Identifying the superspace analogue of
this may help characterizing the superstring background where deformed
superspaces may appear.

When @xmath is invertible, equation ( 1.115 ) might seem to imply that
the curvature @xmath is zero. This is not true in general because of the
presence of the sign in front, which is dependent on the grading of the
summed index @xmath . Moreover, being puzzled by the unusual pattern of
equations found, we have been trying to prove that ( 1.115 ) is
algebraically implied by ( 1.114 ), but this doesn’t seem to work.

We now search for the most general solutions of the conditions ( 1.114 ,
1.115 ). Writing them in terms of the @xmath components we obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (1.118)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The first two conditions necessarily imply the vanishing of the
constants @xmath and @xmath . Inserting this result in the third
constraint we immediately realize that it is automatically satisfied and
the only nontrivial condition which survives is the last one. This
equation has nontrivial solutions. For example, the matrix

  -- -- -- ---------
           (1.119)
  -- -- -- ---------

for any spinor @xmath , is a solution. It would correspond to assume the
same commutations rules among any bosonic coordinate and the spinorial
variables.

We conclude that the most general associative and non(anti)commutative
algebra in Minkowski superspace has the form

  -- -------- -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      (1.120)
     @xmath      @xmath      
  -- -------- -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is subject to the last constraint in ( 1.118 ). Setting
@xmath we recover the usual noncommutative superspace considered so far
in literature [ 52 , 54 , 51 ] .

Under conditions ( 1.118 ) the graded brackets ( 1.101 ) satisfy the
Jacobi identities ( 1.113 ), as can be easily proved by expanding the
functions in power series. In this case we have a well–defined super
Poisson structure on superspace.

We note that a non(anti)commutative but associative geometry always
mantains the standard algebra ( 1.105 ) for the covariant derivatives.
In fact, in this case, from ( 1.108 ) it follows @xmath .

##### Construction of a Kontsevich-like product on superspace

We will now describe the first few steps towards the construction of a
star product defined on the class of general superfields. By definition,
this product must be associative, i.e. it has to satisfy the Jacobi
identities ( 1.113 ) when the fundamental algebra is associative.

In section 1.1.4 we have seen that in the nonsupersymmetric case the
lack of associativity of the fundamental algebra is signaled by the
presence of a nonvanishing 3–form @xmath . A product has been
constructed [ 49 ] so that the terms violating the Jacobi identities are
proportional to @xmath . The product is then automatically associative
when the fundamental algebra is.

In the present case we have shown that the lack of associativity in
superspace is related to a nonvanishing super 3–form. This suggests the
possibility to construct a super star product by suitably generalizing
Kontsevich construction [ 49 ] to superspace. The supersymmetric Poisson
structure we have constructed on superspace can be written in a
manifestly covariant form, as in ( 1.101 ), in terms of a constant
matrix and covariant derivatives that have nontrivial torsion, or as in
( 1.103 ), in terms of a coordinate-dependent matrix and torsion free
derivatives. The second formulation allows for a straightforward
generalization of Kontsevich construction we outlined in section 1.1.4.
However, the same procedure can be performed in a manifestly covariant
way, and I choose to give this second version, so that the geometric
interpretation of the results will be clear.

We begin by considering Moyal–deformed product defined in the usual way

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.121)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath and @xmath are arbitrary superfields, and @xmath denotes a
deformation parameter. In general, due to the lack of
(anti)commutativity among covariant derivatives (see eq. ( 1.106 )), it
is easy to prove that the @xmath –product is not associative even when
the Poisson brackets are. However, inspired by Kontsevich procedure [ 49
] , we perturbatively define a modified product @xmath with the property
to be associative up to second order in @xmath when the Jacobi
identities are satisfied. Precisely, we find an explicit form for the
product by imposing the Jacobi identities ( 1.113 ) to be violated at
this order only by terms proportional to @xmath . To this end we define

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (1.122)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

where

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (1.123)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

Since it is straightforward to show that

  -- -------- -- -- -------- ---------
     @xmath                  (1.124)
                             
                    @xmath   
                    @xmath   
  -- -------- -- -- -------- ---------

up to second order in @xmath the product is associative if and only if
@xmath , i.e. the fundamental algebra is associative. We note that at
this order only the contorsion enters the breaking of associativity,
being the curvature tensor @xmath of order @xmath .

In [ 26 ] we did not pursue the construction of the star product to all
orders in @xmath but we believed that in principle there were no
obstructions to the generalization of Kontsevich procedure to all
orders. The extension of the superspace product we proposed to all
orders in @xmath has been obtained afterwards in [ 55 ] .

We now discuss the closure of the class of chiral superfields under the
deformed products we have introduced. For a generic choice of the
supermatrix @xmath the star product of two chiral superfields
(satisfying @xmath ) is not a chiral superfield, both for associative
and nonassociative products. However, in the particular case where the
only nonvanishing components of the symplectic supermatrix @xmath are
@xmath and @xmath , chiral superfields are closed both under the
deformed product defined in ( 1.121 ) and under Kontsevich star product
( 1.122 ) (for the latter up to terms of order @xmath ). Clearly for
@xmath the above star products are no more associative. Because of this,
it could be problematic to generalize for instance the Wess–Zumino model
to non(anti)commutative superspace, since @xmath . However, one may
notice that for chiral superfields the above star products become
commutative ³ ³ 3 Generalized star products that are commutative but
nonassociative have been considered in a different context in [ 56 ] . .
This commutativity implies that there is no ambiguity in putting the
parenthesis in the cubic interaction term of a deformed Wess–Zumino
model, since, when @xmath is a chiral superfield, @xmath holds.
Therefore, the action for the deformed Wess–Zumino model

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.125)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is well defined and can be studied. Notice that in this case the @xmath
–product in the kinetic term cannot be simply substituted with the
standard product as it happens in superspace geometries where
grassmannian coordinates anticommute [ 52 , 51 ] .

##### Non(anti)commutative @xmath Euclidean superspace

From the discussion of @xmath @xmath superspace it is clear that the
superspace conjugation relations relating @xmath and @xmath are strong
constraints on the non(anti)commutative algebra. The main difference in
the description of euclidean superspace with respect to Minkowski relies
on the reality conditions satisfied by the spinorial variables. So it is
reasonable to hope that in an euclidean signature structures with a
nonvanishing anticommutator between two fermions could appear.

As it is well known [ 57 ] , in euclidean signature a reality condition
on spinors is applicable only in the presence of extended supersymmetry.
In [ 26 ] we concentrated on the simplest case, the @xmath euclidean
superspace, even if our analysis can be easily extended to more general
cases.

In a chiral description the two–component Weyl spinors satisfy a
symplectic Majorana condition

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.126)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath . This implies that the most general non(anti)commutative
algebra can be written as an obvious generalization of ( 1.94 ) with the
functions on the rhs now being in suitable representations of the
R–symmetry group. When imposing covariance under (super)translations we
obtain that the most general non(anti)commutative geometry in euclidean
superspace is

  -- -------- -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      (1.127)
  -- -------- -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
                 (1.128)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath constant.

Following the same steps as in the Minkowski case, we can look for the
most general associative algebra. The results we obtain for associative
non(anti)commuting geometries in euclidean superspace are

  -- -------- -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      (1.129)
     @xmath      @xmath      
  -- -------- -- -------- -- ---------

or

  -- -------- -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      (1.130)
     @xmath      @xmath      
  -- -------- -- -------- -- ---------

We notice that in this case associativity imposes less restrictive
constraints because of the absence of conjugation relations between
@xmath and @xmath . As a consequence, nontrivial anticommutation
relations among @xmath ’s (or @xmath ’s) are allowed. Moreover the
R–symmetry group of the @xmath euclidean superalgebra is broken only by
the constant terms @xmath and @xmath . Setting these terms equal to zero
leads to nontrivial (anti)commutation relations preserving @xmath
–symmetry.

Again, explicit expressions for the corresponding graded brackets can be
obtained as an obvious generalization of ( 1.101 , 1.102 ). In this case
they define a super Poisson structure on euclidean superspace. A simple
example of a super Poisson structure is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.131)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We notice that this extension is allowed only in euclidean superspace,
where it is consistent with the reality conditions on the spinorial
variables.

In this section I will review nonanticommutative @xmath superspace
introduced by Seiberg in [ 28 ] and I will explain its relation with my
results in [ 26 ] . As I have discussed in detail in the last section,
in [ 26 ] I obtained the most general nonanticommutative deformation of
@xmath @xmath superspace compatible with supersymmetry and
associativity. This involves nontrivial @xmath , @xmath and @xmath ,
while @xmath , @xmath and @xmath cannot be turned on. The situation
improves in euclidean signature, where it is possible to turn on the
fermionic anticommutators because of the different spinor conjugation
relations. Rigorously, a superspace with euclidean signature can be
defined only with extended supersymmetry, because of the impossibility
to assign consistent reality conditions to @xmath and @xmath in @xmath [
57 ] . This is why I have studied the @xmath euclidean superspace in [
26 ] . However, one can formally define an @xmath euclidean superspace
by temporarily doubling the fermionic degrees of freedom, as it is done
by Seiberg in [ 28 ] .

To show how this works, I will first redefine the @xmath euclidean
spinor variables ( 1.126 ) as follows

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.132)
     @xmath      (1.133)
  -- -------- -- ---------

These satisfy the reality conditions

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.134)
     @xmath      (1.135)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and analogous for the dotted variables. Dotted and undotted variables
are unrelated. I will refer to @xmath and @xmath as the left-moving
sector of the theory and to @xmath and @xmath as the right-moving
sector. This terminology will be clarified in section 1.2.4, where the
string theory origin of deformed superspaces will be discussed. We will
see in section 1.2.4 that open string boundary conditions relate left-
and right-moving fermionic variables on the D-brane ( @xmath on the
boundary). As a result, the effective field theory on the brane is
described by an @xmath euclidean superspace with fermionic variables
@xmath and @xmath . For this reason from now on I will only consider
spinor coordinates in the left-moving sector.

In [ 26 ] we have used in both Minkowski and euclidean signature a
nonchiral representation for superspace covariant derivatives. As a
result consistency with supersymmetry transformations implied that if we
turned on a nonvanishing anticommutators between two fermionic
variables, also nonzero boson-boson and boson-fermion commutators
appeared. This made the algebra coordinate dependent and forced us to
build a complicated Kontevich-like product.

A way to obtain a simpler, constant algebra for the supercoordinates is
the following [ 58 ] . In four dimensions it is possible to use a chiral
representation of supersymmetry, where, for each supersymmetry, one of
the two covariant derivatives coincides with the ordinary one while the
other gets dressed. If we make this chiral choice in @xmath euclidean
superspace, by defining

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.136)
     @xmath      (1.137)
  -- -------- -- ---------

corresponding to the supersymmetry transformations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.138)
  -- -------- -- ---------

we immediately realize that the nonanticommutative algebra

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.139)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath a constant symmetric matrix, is consistent with ( 1.138 )
and trivially associative . One can easily check that, comparing to (
1.106 , 1.107 , 1.108 ), the supersymmetry algebra is not modified by
the deformation but the algebra of covariant derivatives becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.140)
     @xmath      (1.141)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This is a problem when one tries to construct chiral superfields. So,
even if this algebra is very simple, it is not suitable for constructing
deformations of ordinary theories in superspace.

Seiberg in [ 28 ] chose the opposite chiral representation with respect
to ( 1.137 )

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.142)
     @xmath      (1.143)
  -- -------- -- ---------

corresponding to the supersymmetry transformations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.144)
  -- -------- -- ---------

When we turn on a nontrivial anticommutator between the @xmath ’s, we
obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.145)
     @xmath      (1.146)
     @xmath      (1.147)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This is consistent with supersymmetry and associativity (it is just the
“ @xmath ” version of the algebra ( 1.1.6 ) I gave in [ 26 ] and
discussed in the previous section). This is coordinate-dependent and
would require the construction of a Kontsevich-like product for the
superfield algebra. However, Seiberg observed that it is possible to
make the change of variables

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.148)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In terms of @xmath the superspace algebra takes the form ( 1.139 ) and
this makes it possible to define a Moyal-like associative product acting
on superfields @xmath as follows

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.149)
              @xmath   @xmath      (1.150)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath . In contradistinction to the bosonic case, this Moyal-like
product has a finite derivative expansion, because of the grassmannian
nature of the variables involved in the deformation.

With the antichiral representation ( 1.143 ) the covariant derivative
algebra is not deformed, while the supersymmetry algebra is deformed by
curvature terms analogous to the ones we found in ( 1.106 , 1.107 ,
1.108 )

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.151)
     @xmath      (1.152)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Since only the dotted sector is modified, in [ 28 ] its is argued that
only @xmath is preserved. Exactly as in the @xmath case discussed in the
previous section, these susy-breaking terms do not affect the
supercoordinate algebra, that is consistent with supersymmetry.

In [ 28 ] chiral and vector superfields in @xmath have been extensively
studied. In particular, since the covariant derivatives are not modified
by the deformation, it is possible to define (anti)chiral superfields
whose class is closed under @xmath and to write down the action for a
deformed Wess-Zumino model

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.153)
              @xmath   @xmath      (1.154)
              @xmath   @xmath      (1.155)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the auxiliary field in the chiral multiplet and total
superspace derivatives have been neglected to obtain the last equality.
Similarly, one can see that the @xmath deformation of super Yang-Mills
is characterized by explicitly susy-breaking P-dependent component terms
[ 28 ] . Moreover in [ 28 ] the antichiral ring defined by the operator
relation @xmath has been studied and it has been shown that all its
properties are preserved by the deformation, while the chiral ring
cannot be defined since @xmath is not a symmetry of the theory anymore.

##### Results in non(anti)commutative field theories

After Seiberg’s paper [ 28 ] appeared, deformed superspaces have
attracted much attention and a lot of efforts have been done to
elucidate the properties of nonanticommutative field theories in
superspace. This interest is mostly due to the fact that
nonanticommutative superspaces have been shown to naturally emerge in
superstring theory in the presence of R-R backgrounds [ 27 , 28 , 29 ,
53 ] . I will review the string theory side of the story in section
1.2.4. Here I’m going to browse the huge bibliography and discuss the
main results obtained, without giving any detail. I will first discuss
the progress in understanding @xmath theories.

In [ 28 ] the @xmath deformation of WZ and super Yang-Mills theories
have been proposed. The deformation of WZ model is easy to describe,
since in component formulation it corresponds to adding to the ordinary
action a cubic term in the auxiliary field @xmath . In [ 59 , 60 ] some
features of the deformed WZ model, such as non validity of standard
nonrenormalization theorems, stability of the vacuum energy and
existence of the antichiral ring have been discussed through some
examples, in both component and superspace formulations. In particular,
since supersymmetry plays an important role to guarantee renormalization
through partial cancellation of UV divergences associated to bosonic and
fermionic degrees of freedom, it is compelling to study
renormalizability properties of the @xmath theory where part of the
supersymmetry is explicitly broken.

A systematical analysis of perturbative renormalizability of @xmath WZ
model has been performed in [ 58 ] by explicit calculations up to two
loops. It has been shown that, even if new divergences appear, the model
can be rendered renormalizable by adding ab initio @xmath and @xmath
terms to the ordinary lagrangian. It is somehow expected that these
terms may accompany the @xmath deformation, since they are allowed by
the symmetry of the theory. These two-loop results have been extended to
all orders in perturbation theory in both component and superspace
formulations [ 61 ] . The proof of renormalizability has been given on
the base of dimensional arguments and global symmetries.

The study of deformations of gauge theories is more interesting than the
scalar case. @xmath @xmath gauge theories have been proven to be
renormalizable in [ 62 ] in WZ gauge. This result have been checked up
to one loop in [ 63 ] in component formulation, again in WZ gauge. The
study of these gauge theories in a manifestly gauge independent
superspace setup has been accomplished by generalizing the background
field method to nonanticommutative case [ 64 ] .

In [ 65 , 66 , 67 ] @xmath super Yang-Mills instantons have been
studied.

In [ 68 , 69 ] the problem of constructing a Seiberg-Witten map
analogous to the one discussed in section 1.2.1 for superfields in
deformed superspaces has been considered.

The case with extended supersymmetry has also been considered [ 70 , 71
] and it has been shown that, while in general @xmath supersymmetry is
broken to @xmath , there are particular cases where @xmath survives.
Moreover, super Yang-Mills theory on extended deformed superspaces has
also been studied in [ 68 ] .

@xmath @xmath classical aspects of sigma models characterized by a
general Kähler potential and arbitrary superpotential deformed by a
nonanticommutative product have been studied in [ 72 ] .

Finally, the connection between nonanticommutative geometry and
supermatrix models have been studied in [ 73 , 74 ] .

### 1.2 Non(anti)commutative field theory from the (super)string

#### 1.2.1 Noncommutative Yang-Mills theory from the open string

In this section I mostly refer to [ 7 ] and show that a constant
Neveu-Schwarz Neveu-Schwarz (NS-NS) @xmath -field background modifies
string dynamics nontrivially when D-branes are present. The open string
with extrema constrained to lay on Dp-branes sees a deformed
target-space @xmath metric and a noncommutative target space coordinate
algebra, characterized by a matrix @xmath . Taking a zero slope limit
@xmath in such a way to keep the above open-string parameters finite,
one can obtain two different effective theory descriptions. Depending on
the choice of the regularization prescription, one obtains a field
theory in ordinary space where the background field appears explicitly,
or a noncommutative field theory where the background field only appears
implicitly in the noncommutativity matrix @xmath . We are not going to
give a review of the basic string theory needed in this section. For
this we suggest the textbooks [ 3 , 4 ] .

##### The open string effective metric and noncommutativity parameter

Let us consider the bosonic sector of open string theory, in a
10-dimensional flat spacetime background with metric @xmath , in the
presence of a constant NS-NS field @xmath and Dp-branes. Let us assume
@xmath , where @xmath is a generic spacelike direction and @xmath is
timelike. This means that we are going to consider a magnetic @xmath
field. At the end of this section I will briefly discuss the electric
case, to show that a zero-slope limit giving a noncommutative effective
field theory on the brane is not admitted in this case [ 16 ] .

It is well-known that a constant background @xmath field can be gauged
away in the bulk, but not on the boundary, on the Dp-brane, where it
acts as a constant magnetic (or electric) field . If @xmath , we can
assume @xmath . We will choose spacetime coordinates in such a way that
@xmath for @xmath only and @xmath for @xmath . The worldsheet action is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.156)
     @xmath      (1.157)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the second equality shows that antisymmetry of @xmath implies that
the @xmath -term is a boundary term. @xmath is the (euclidean) string
worldsheet, @xmath is its boundary, @xmath is the derivative tangent to
the boundary @xmath . Because of the presence of Dp-branes, the boundary
term cannot be eliminated. It modifies the boundary conditions for the
open string in the directions @xmath along the brane

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.158)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the derivative in the normal direction with respect to
the boundary @xmath . In this equation both i and j are along the brane.
We observe that for @xmath we obtain Neumann boundary conditions, while
for maximal @xmath rank on the brane and @xmath we get Dirichlet ones.
In the latter case the string extrema are constrained to a single point
on the Dp-brane, since the coordinates along the brane that describe
them do not move. We can thus think that string extrema are attached to
a 0-brane on the p-brane.

From now on we will consider the classical approximation to string
theory. @xmath is a disk, that can be mapped to the upper half plane,
described by complex coordinates @xmath , @xmath , because of conformal
invariance. The boundary conditions ( 1.158 ) can then be rewritten as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.159)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath , @xmath , @xmath . The propagator @xmath with the boundary
conditions ( 1.159 ) is given by [ 75 ]

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.160)
     @xmath      (1.161)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.162)
     @xmath      (1.163)
     @xmath      (1.164)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and @xmath , @xmath denote the symmetric and antisymmetric part of the
matrix in brackets, respectively. The constant quantities @xmath depend
on @xmath , but not on @xmath and @xmath . They can be fixed to a
certain value by making use of the fact that @xmath is arbitrary.

We are interested in taking the limit @xmath , @xmath in ( 1.161 ). This
is because in the open string case vertex operators are to be inserted
on the boundary of the worldsheet. Taking the limit one obtains

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.165)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The function @xmath is @xmath ( @xmath ) for positive (negative) @xmath
. The discontinuity in the propagator can be expressed in terms of the
function @xmath when convenient values for the constants @xmath are
chosen.

@xmath is interpreted as the effective metric seen by open strings. This
can be understood by comparing with the closed string case, where the
propagator between two internal worldsheet points has a short distance
behavior given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.166)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It is clear from ( 1.165 ) that, in the commutative limit @xmath , the
metric @xmath is for the open string what @xmath is for the closed
string.

By considering the second term in ( 1.165 ), we can see that the
coefficient @xmath can be interpreted as noncommutativity parameter for
the coordinates along the Dp-brane. In conformal field theory there
exists a correspondence between time ordering and operator ordering,
that in this case gives

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.167)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The first equality says that the path integral of the time-ordered
combination in the right hand side corresponds to a matrix element of
the equal-time commutator between @xmath and @xmath . So we deduce that
the coordinates @xmath are noncommuting with parameter @xmath .

##### Correlation functions, effective action and Moyal product

Let us now consider the product of two tachyon vertex operators @xmath ,
@xmath , with @xmath . By contracting with the two point function (
1.165 ) we obtain the short distance behavior

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.168)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We observe that in the limit @xmath the OPE formula reduces to @xmath
product

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.169)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Therefore we expect that in the limit @xmath the theory should be easily
described in terms of Moyal product. However, many interesting aspects
emerge even without taking that limit.

We have shown that open strings in the presence of a constant @xmath
field on a Dp-brane can be described not only in terms of the two
parameters @xmath and @xmath , but also in terms of two functions @xmath
and @xmath , representing the effective metric and noncommutativity
parameter seen by the open string ending on the brane.

Now we are going to show that, if we choose to work with the second
couple of parameters, the dependence of the effective theory on @xmath
is very simple. The theory with a nonvanishing @xmath can be obtained
from the one with @xmath by simply substituting Moyal @xmath products
characterized by the noncommutativity parameter @xmath to ordinary
products. This is a general feature, no limit has to be taken.

It is well-known that perturbative string theory requires the evaluation
of the path integral of vertex operators the generally take the form
@xmath , where @xmath is a polynomial in the derivatives of @xmath . Let
us now consider the expectation value of the product of @xmath vertex
operators, with momenta @xmath and @xmath along the Dp-brane. We are
interested in determining the explicit dependence on the parameter
@xmath , while we would like to keep the dependence on @xmath implicit.
The two-point function is the sum of two terms, one contains @xmath
only, the other contains @xmath only. When we contract terms containing
derivatives of @xmath , the part of the propagator involving @xmath does
not contribute, because @xmath is a constant function. So we can obtain
the @xmath dependence by just taking into consideration the contraction
between exponentials

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.170)
     @xmath      (1.171)
                 (1.172)
  -- -------- -- ---------

So the @xmath -dependence is simply given by the phase factor

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.173)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Because of momentum conservation @xmath and antisymmetry of @xmath , (
1.173 ) only depends on the cyclic order of the points @xmath on the
worldsheet boundary.

By knowing the @xmath -matrix of low energy massless particles, one can
deduce order by order in @xmath an effective action for the theory. This
will be expressed in terms of a certain number of functions @xmath that
in general may have values in the space of @xmath matrices (think of the
nonabelian gauge theory case). @xmath represents the wave function of
the i-th field. By looking at ( 1.164 ) one notes that @xmath . So the
general form of the effective action for @xmath will be as follows

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.174)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath stands for the product of @xmath partial derivatives with
respect to certain unspecified coordinates.

Now it is easy to move on to a theory with @xmath . If the effective
action is written in momentum space, then it is sufficient to insert the
phase factor ( 1.173 ). In configuration space this corresponds to
replacing ordinary products with Moyal @xmath products (see ( 1.36 )).
To conclude, the effective action with @xmath takes the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.175)
  -- -------- -- ---------

So we have found an easy way to describe the theory with @xmath when
knowing the one with @xmath . However we must stress that both theories
have an equally complicated @xmath expansion.

##### The description in the zero-slope limit

The formalism of noncommutative geometry becomes much more powerful when
the zero-slope limit @xmath is taken. This is somehow expected from (
1.169 ).
We would like to take the limit in such a way to keep the open string
parameters @xmath and @xmath finite. This can be done by choosing

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.176)
     @xmath      (1.177)
  -- -------- -- ---------

when all the rest is kept fixed (also the two form @xmath ). Equation (
1.164 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.178)
                 (1.179)
     @xmath      (1.180)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The propagator for two points on the boundary becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.181)
  -- -------- -- ---------

For two generic functions @xmath and @xmath we then obtain (see ( 1.169
))

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.182)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and thus

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.183)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is Moyal product ( 1.32 ).
As a result, correlation functions of exponential operators on the disk
boundary are given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.184)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In the general case with @xmath functions @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.185)
  -- -------- -- ---------

##### Adding gauge fields

Let us now add to the action ( 1.157 ) a term representing the coupling
of the string worldsheet to a gauge field @xmath . For simplicity we
will take @xmath .

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.186)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Comparing with ( 1.157 ) we see that the constant field @xmath can be
replaced by a gauge field @xmath , whose field strength is @xmath . The
bosonic string coupled to the @xmath -field background is invariant
under the gauge symmetry

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.187)
  -- -------- -- ---------

modulo boundary terms. These terms can be compensated by the shift

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.188)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Therefore, physics will be described by the gauge invariant combination
@xmath .

The action ( 1.186 ) is invariant under the transformation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.189)
  -- -------- -- ---------

since the variation of the integrand is a total derivative.

When we consider a quantum field theory we must pay attention to the
regularization procedure. Physics of course must not depend on the
particular choice of regularization! If we choose a Pauli-Villars
regularization, we obtain an ordinary gauge theory, symmetric under the
usual gauge transformation ( 1.189 ). We can make a different choice,
though. We can use a point-splitting regularization, characterized by
the fact that the product of two operators at the same point never
appears. Actually, one first eliminates the region @xmath and then takes
the limit @xmath . Now we are going to evaluate the variation of the
path integral of the exponential of the action ( 1.186 ) under the gauge
transformation ( 1.189 ), having first expanded the exponential in
series with respect to @xmath . The first term in the expansion gives

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.190)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Even though the integrand of the second factor is a total derivative,
one gets a boundary contribution for @xmath . In the limit @xmath this
contribution takes the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.191)
                 (1.192)
  -- -------- -- ---------

To obtain this results one makes use of the fact that there are no
contractions between @xmath and @xmath with the constant propagator (
1.181 ). Moreover, the relation ( 1.183 ) between operators and @xmath
product has been taken into account.

To cancel out the term ( 1.192 ), we have to modify the transformation (
1.189 ). So we discover that the point splitting regularized theory is
not invariant under ( 1.189 ), but under the new transformation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.193)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We recognize the gauge invariance ( 1.54 ) of noncommutative gauge
theories with @xmath . We have introduced the “hatted” notation @xmath
for fields in a noncommutative algebra.

It is possible to show [ 7 ] that at a generic order @xmath in the
@xmath -expansion of the exponential of the action the correct gauge
invariance is the noncommutative one, when point-splitting
regularization is performed.

Moreover in [ 7 ] the calculation of the expectation value of three
gauge vertex operators is performed. The result of this computation
could also be obtained by considering the following effective action as
a starting point

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.194)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the field strength can be expressed in terms of @xmath as in (
1.54 ).

We have shown that the same string theory in the limit @xmath can be
either described by an effective action corresponding to an ordinary
gauge theory or by one associated to a noncommutative gauge theory,
depending on the choice of the regularization procedure. Since physics
cannot depend on the way this procedure is performed, two results
obtained with different regularizations must be related by a
redefinition of the coupling constants. In the worldsheet action the
spacetime-valued fields play the role of coupling constants, so we
expect that commutative and noncommutative effective descriptions should
be related by a redefinition of these fields.

A natural guess is that a local map @xmath among gauge fields and a
corresponding map @xmath among the group parameters exists. In section
1.1.2 we observed that noncommutative @xmath group is nonabelian. This
tells us that such a correspondence cannot exist. Actually, the
existence of such a map would imply an isomorphism between the ordinary
gauge group and the corresponding noncommutative one. Since an abelian
group cannot be isomorphic to a non abelian one, the first proposal for
the map is ruled out.

However, what is really needed for physics is that the gauge-transformed
field @xmath corresponds to the gauge-transformed field @xmath .
Therefore it is sufficient that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.195)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and we can look for a correspondence

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.196)
     @xmath      (1.197)
  -- -------- -- ---------

satisfying ( 1.195 ). The @xmath -dependence of @xmath solves the
problem of the isomorphism between the two gauge groups. A relation like
( 1.197 ) does not imply any correspondence between the two group
structures. A correspondence of the required form was found in [ 7 ]
(Seiberg-Witten map). It is given in terms of a set of differential
equations describing how @xmath and @xmath must vary with @xmath for the
physics to remain unchanged.

The results discussed in this section concerning an open string ending
on a single Dp-brane can be easily generalized to the case of a stack of
@xmath coincident D-branes. In this case one obtains a @xmath
noncommutative Yang-Mills theory as an effective field theory on the
brane worldvolume. In section 1.2.2 I have commented on the fact that
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath subgroups are not closed under Moyal product,
so in principle one expects that restrictions to this subgroups should
not emerge from the string. Actually, the case of @xmath is ruled out
because the @xmath degree of freedom in @xmath ceases to decouple.
@xmath and @xmath restrictions can instead emerge, in a very nontrivial
way, by orientifold projection, as shown in [ 43 ] .

##### Open string in the presence of an electric NS-NS background and
the breakdown of unitarity and causality in time-space noncommutative
field theories

In section 1.1.2 I have discussed unitarity and causality problems in
noncommutative field theories with time-space noncommutativity, i.e.
with @xmath .

In principle we could expect these theories to arise in string theory in
the presence of D-branes and a constant electric @xmath background.
However, the case of an electric background field is very different with
respect to the magnetic one. It can be shown that if the background
electric field @xmath exceeds the critical upper value @xmath , string
pairs are produced that destabilize the vacuum. So, if the electric
field is along the @xmath direction and the metric is diagonal in the
@xmath plane with components given by @xmath , the bound is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.198)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In [ 76 ] it has been shown that in this case the open string parameters
@xmath are related to the electric field on the brane by the formula

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.199)
  -- -------- -- ---------

As before, to obtain the effective field theory on the brane we have to
consider a zero-slope limit @xmath . From the previous formula, it is
clear that if we want to keep the open string metric @xmath finite in
the limit, when @xmath then also @xmath . Therefore, it is possible to
obtain a field theory description involving massless open string modes
only, but this will be an ordinary field theory and not a noncommutative
one. On the other hand, we can keep the noncommutativity parameter
@xmath finite, but then @xmath must also be finite and we are
considering a string theory and not a field theory.

Indeed, in [ 76 ] , it has been shown that a limit can be taken where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.200)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and all the other parameters are kept fixed, in particular the open
string metric @xmath . In this limit

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.201)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is finite, so time-space noncommutativity is present. The theory
obtained describes open strings in noncommutive spacetime (NCOS). Open
strings decouple from closed strings, therefore also from gravity. In [
77 ] it has been shown that NCOS theory is the S-dual description of
strongly coupled, spatially noncommutative @xmath Yang-Mills theory
(other works concerning NCOS are listed in [ 78 ] ).

We conclude that noncommutative field theory with time-space
noncommutativity does not emerge as a consistent truncation of string
theory. Moreover, string theory in the presence of an electric
background on the brane is unitary and acausal effects are not present [
15 ] . So @xmath corrections to noncommutative “electric” field theory
restore unitarity and causality.

It is clear that “electric” noncommutative field theories are missing
some degrees of freedom, related to the undecoupled massive string
modes, that are necessary for unitarity and causality of the theory. In
[ 17 ] it has been shown that tachyonic particles are produced in
scattering processes of noncommutative field theory with @xmath turned
on. Form the string theory point of view, these particles may be viewed
as a remnant of a continuous spectrum of these undecoupled closed-string
modes.

#### 1.2.2 Generalization to the superstring in RNS and GS formalisms

In this section I will generalize to the superstring the results
obtained in the previous section for the bosonic string. In [ 7 ] the
string with @xmath worldsheet supersymmetry (RNS) is considered. In [ 54
] instead the manifestly target-space supersymmetric superstring (GS) is
discussed. In both cases the open superstring is coupled to a constant
NS-NS background in the presence of D-branes. I’m not going to give an
introduction to these two formalisms for the superstring. For this I
suggest the textbooks [ 3 , 4 ]

##### Open RNS string in the presence of a constant @xmath-field and
D-branes

In [ 7 ] the following action for the RNS string coupled to a constant
magnetic NS-NS background field @xmath is considered

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.202)
                 (1.203)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In the directions @xmath , @xmath along the brane the following boundary
conditions are imposed

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.204)
     @xmath      (1.205)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The first condition can be naturally obtained by requiring that there
are no boundary terms in the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion. The
second one, involving fermions, is obtained by requiring consistency
under supersymmetry of the boundary conditions, but cannot be obtained
from the action ( 1.203 ). Actually, one finds an inconsistency when
requiring both the vanishing of boundary terms in the variation of the
action and the compatibility of boundary conditions with supersymmetry.
In [ 79 ] (see also [ 80 ] for a nice summary of the methods used) it
has been shown that boundary terms can be added to the action ( 1.203 )
so that the supersymmetric boundary conditions ( 1.205 ) follow as
boundary contributions to the field equations. Therefore, the theory
described by the action @xmath , with

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.206)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and by the boundary conditions ( 1.205 ) is invariant under the rigid
@xmath worldsheet supersymmetry transformations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.207)
     @xmath      (1.208)
     @xmath      (1.209)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the parameter @xmath is a worldsheet spinor and a spacetime
scalar.

In [ 7 ] the open string is coupled to a gauge field @xmath by adding to
( 1.203 ) the following boundary term

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.210)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the ordinary field strength (we are considering @xmath
case for simplicity) and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.211)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The variation of ( 1.210 ) under the supersymmetry transformations (
1.209 ) is a total derivative

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.212)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Exactly as in bosonic case, the theory is regularized by making use of a
“point splitting” technique and extra boundary terms are produced.
Expanding the exponential of the action to first order in @xmath we can
compute the variation of the path integral up to first order in @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.213)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Extra boundary terms appear when @xmath and @xmath . If the following
interaction term is added to the action

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.214)
  -- -------- -- ---------

the extra terms are cancelled by its variation under ( 1.209 ). So we
deduce that @xmath must be changed into

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.215)
  -- -------- -- ---------

being @xmath the noncommutative field strength. If we had performed a
Pauli-Villars regularization, instead, ( 1.210 ) would have been
invariant under worlsheet supersymmetry ( 1.209 ) and we would have
ended up with field strength and gauge symmetry of ordinary @xmath .

Summarizing, in [ 7 ] it has been shown that the RNS open string in the
presence of a constant @xmath -field and D-branes can be described, in
the zero-slope limit @xmath , either by ordinary gauge theory or by
noncommutative gauge theory on the brane, depending on the choice of the
regularization prescription. The two different descriptions are related
by a Seiberg-Witten map, as in bosonic case.

In [ 79 ] a different approach to the problem of coupling a gauge field
to the open string in the presence of the @xmath field is presented. The
coupling to the @xmath field is reconsidered in a way to preserve both
shift symmetry and supersymmetry. A coupling term different with respect
to ( 1.210 ) is found that is not supersymmetric by itself, but only
together with the rest of the action @xmath and after making use of the
corresponding boundary conditions.

##### Open GS superstring in the presence of a constant @xmath-field and
D-branes

The Green-Schwarz superstring has manifest target space @xmath
supersymmetry. The target space is a ten dimensional superspace
described by the coordinates @xmath , with @xmath . When the theory is
coupled to a certain background and D-branes are present, in principle
target space fermionic coordinates could be involved in
noncommutativity. In [ 54 ] , it has been shown that this is not true in
the simple case of a constant NS-NS background. In this case only
bosonic coordinates become noncommutative. In section 1.2.4 we will see
that fermionic coordinates are indeed involved in noncommutativity when
a constant R-R background is present.

The action for the GS superstring coupled to a constant NS-NS background
in flat spacetime is given by

  -- -------- -- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath      @xmath            (1.217)
                          @xmath   
  -- -------- -- -------- -------- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.218)
  -- -------- -- ---------

are the supersymmetry invariant one-forms. It is clear from ( 1.217 )
that only bosonic coordinates couple to @xmath . However, boundary
conditions along the D-brane must also be considered before we can
deduce that fermions are not affected by the presence of the background.
We find that bosonic coordinates must satisfy the same boundary
conditions we found in the bosonic case ( 1.158 ). The two fermionic
coordinates @xmath and @xmath must satisfy @xmath on the boundary, where
@xmath is a suitable @xmath -dependent matrix satisfying @xmath . So the
action ( 1.217 ) with these boundary conditions is invariant under the
supersymmetry

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.219)
     @xmath      (1.220)
  -- -------- -- ---------

only if the supersymmetry parameters @xmath also satisfy @xmath . So the
D-brane breaks half of the supersymmetry.

In [ 54 ] an explicit computation is performed to dermine the coordinate
algebra on the brane. Following the method introduced by Chu and Ho [ 81
] , the authors deal with boundary conditions along the brane by
treating them as constraints on phase-space. The presence of these
constraints makes it necessary to consider Dirac brackets instead of
Poisson brackets. Working in a light-cone gauge, in [ 54 ] it was shown
that the fermionic variables surviving the gauge fixing procedure
satisfy a standard anticommutative algebra and only the bosonic sector
is affected by the presence of the constant NS-NS background, exactly as
in [ 7 ] . So it is clear that if we want target-space fermionic
variables to be deformed, we must consider a different background.

#### 1.2.3 Noncommutative selfdual Yang-Mills from the @xmath string

In this section I will briefly introduce the @xmath string and its
peculiar properties. Referring to [ 82 ] , I will apply the analysis
outlined in the previous section to the open @xmath string in the
presence of @xmath spacefilling D3-branes and a constant @xmath field to
show that it coincides at tree level with @xmath noncommutative selfdual
Yang-Mills.

The @xmath fermionic string is characterized by an @xmath worldsheet
supersymmetry. For the string to be critical, the target space must be
four-dimensional with signature @xmath . Its propagating degrees of
freedom are the embedding coordinates @xmath and the RNS Majorana
spinors @xmath , @xmath . These matter fields are coupled to the @xmath
supergravity multiplet. Using symmetries of the action, one can show
that all the gravitational degrees of freedom can be gauged away and in
superconformal gauge the action can be written as follows

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.221)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath ( @xmath scaling parameter) is the metric in @xmath . This
action has a residual symmetry given by the @xmath superconformal group,
that also contains rigid @xmath supersymmetry corresponding to the
transformations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.222)
     @xmath      (1.223)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a complex structure compatible with the metric @xmath
(with our flat metric @xmath ).

It has been shown that the open @xmath fermionic string at tree level is
identical to self-dual Yang-Mills in @xmath dimensions [ 83 ] . The
absence of massive states in the physical spectrum is related to the
vanishing of all tree-level amplitudes beyond three-point. The vanishing
of amplitudes implies the existence of symmetries and vice-versa. Since
an infinite number of tree-level amplitudes vanish, we expect an
infinite number of symmetries to be present. These were described in [
84 , 85 ] .

The @xmath string seems to be a master theory quantizing integrable
systems. It is well-known that most integrable models in @xmath and
@xmath can be obtained by dimensional reduction from selfdual
Yang-Mills. In [ 83 ] a possible definition for integrability in @xmath
has been proposed, inspired by the peculiar properties of the tree-level
S-matrix of the @xmath string. A system in @xmath would be classically
integrable if the @xmath -point tree-level amplitudes vanish beyond
@xmath . This definition is reminiscent of the one that can be given in
@xmath concerning factorization of the S-matrix.

The @xmath open fermionic string can be coupled to a two-form NS-NS
background @xmath field. In [ 82 ] it has been shown that additional
boundary terms must be added to the action for the boundary conditions
obtained from the Euler-Lagrange procedure to be @xmath supersymmetric,
exactly as in the case of the @xmath string [ 79 ] . Moreover, the
presence of the second supersymmetry implies a nontrivial constraint on
the @xmath field. This is the compatibility condition with respect to
the complex structure @xmath , i.e. @xmath must be Kähler. The
consistent @xmath gauge fixed action is then

  -- -------- -------- -- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath               (1.225)
                          @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -- -------- ---------

This action functional cannot be obtained from a superspace formulation.

In [ 82 ] it has been shown that the open @xmath string dynamics in the
presence of @xmath coincident D3-branes filling the target space is
modified by a magnetic @xmath field so that the open string sees an
effective metric @xmath and a noncommutative algebra on the brane
characterized by a @xmath parameter. The starting point for the analysis
is again the expression for the open string correlators ( 1.161 ). A
particular choice of the @xmath generators allows us to write the
matrices @xmath and @xmath in terms of the generators of the @xmath
subgroup of @xmath , so that in complete generality the NS-NS field is
expressed in terms of the two quantities @xmath and @xmath as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.226)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In this basis the open string effective metric @xmath , noncommutativity
parameter @xmath and coupling @xmath can be obtained and have
expressions similar to the corresponding ones for the ten-dimensional
string ( 1.164 ).

Exactly as in the ten dimensional case a zero-slope limit can be taken
that keeps the open string parameters finite. In this limit it has been
shown that tree-level three-string amplitudes can be obtained from the
noncommutative version of self-dual Yang-Mills in Leznov gauge (this
depends on the choice of the Lorentz frame, one can as well obtain Yang
gauge). The corresponding lagrangian is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.227)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the open string effective metric and @xmath is the
corresponding derivative defined by @xmath . This result is deduced as
in the ten-dimensional case by noting that the effect of turning on the
@xmath -field is the multiplication of any open string amplitude by a
phase factor ( 1.173 ). This corresponds to replacing ordinary products
with Moyal products in the worldvolume effective field theory.

As a nontrivial check, it has also been shown that the tree-level
four-point function for @xmath noncommutative self-dual Yang-Mills in
Leznov gauge vanishes. Therefore, the natural deformation of selfdual
Yang-Mills in Leznov gauge seems to preserve the nice scattering
properties of the original, commutative theory. We have seen that the
vanishing of tree-amplitudes beyond three-point defines integrable
systems in @xmath exactly as the factorization of the S-matrix is a
definition of a an integrable system in @xmath . So the result in [ 82 ]
suggests that noncommutative selfdual Yang-Mills is integrable.

This result will be important for the further developments considered in
[ 37 ] , where, in collaboration with O. Lechtenfeld, L. Mazzanti, S.
Penati and A. Popov, I have constructed a noncommutative version of the
sine-Gordon theory with a factorized S-matrix, that is obtained as a
dimensional reduction of @xmath selfdual Yang Mills.

#### 1.2.4 Non(anti)commutative field theories from the covariant
superstring

In this section I would like to discuss the superstring origin of the
non(anti)commutative superspaces introduced in sections 1.1.5, 1.1.6,
1.1.7.

Up to now I have discussed in detail the case of the open bosonic string
in flat space in the presence of a constant NS-NS background field and
Dp-branes and I have shown that the presence of the background induces a
noncommutativity in the brane coordinate algebra. I have generalized
this result to the RNS superstring, that is characterized by an @xmath
worldsheet supersymmetry and happens to exhibit target space
supersymmetry after a consistent truncation of the spectrum (GSO
projection) is performed. This theory is not manifestly supersymmetric
in target space. I have also shown how the bosonic results can be
generalized to the manifestly target-space supersymmetric GS
superstring. In this case we have seen that the presence of a constant
NS-NS background does not modify the anticommutators between fermionic
coordinates. Finally, I have generalized the bosonic string results to
the @xmath string, characterized by an @xmath worldsheet supersymmetry.
In all these cases a constant NS-NS two-form background has been
considered.

In this section we face the problem of finding a suitable superstring
background that could induce, in the presence of D-branes, a
nonanticommutative deformation of target space fermionic variables,
exactly as the NS-NS B-field induces a deformation of bosonic target
space coordinates. So target space must be a superspace and thus we need
to consider a manifestly supersymmetric version of the superstring. An
example of this is the Green-Schwarz superstring [ 4 ] we considered in
the previous section. It lives in a ten-dimensional superspace and its
action is manifestly supersymmetric. Unfortunately, because of its
complicated worldsheet symmetries, its action in a flat background is
not quadratic, it cannot be quantized in a Lorentz-covariant way and
this renders the formalism terribly difficult to handle.

Recently [ 30 ] a new proposal was made for an action describing the
ten-dimensional superstring, that is manifestly target-space
supersymmetric and is quadratic in a flat background ⁴ ⁴ 4 An
introduction to this formalism will be given in chapter 3. . In this
formalism the R-R field strengths are all contained in a bispinor @xmath
where the two indices may have opposite or same chirality depending
whether we are in IIA or IIB superstring theory. It is natural to think
that, as much as the @xmath background is related to a noncommutative
deformation @xmath , the @xmath background may be related to a @xmath
deformation.

In a series of papers [ 27 , 28 , 53 , 29 ] it has been shown that this
is indeed the case. In the first three papers the four-dimensional
theory obtained from type II ten-dimensional superstring compactified on
a Calabi-Yau three-fold [ 86 , 87 ] has been considered, while in the
last paper the full ten-dimensional superstring theory [ 30 , 88 ] has
been discussed. I will consider the four-dimensional case first, since,
compared to the covariant quantization of the superstring in ten
dimension, the formalism is much simpler in this case, because of the
smaller amount of manifest supersymmetry.

The relevant part of the lagrangian density is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.228)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath @xmath @xmath and @xmath are conjugate momenta to the
superspace fermionic variables @xmath @xmath @xmath and @xmath
respectively ⁵ ⁵ 5 Berkovits covariant formalism is first order for
fermionic variables, whose conjugate momenta are introduced as
independent fields. This was first done by Siegel in his approach to the
GS superstring [ 89 ] . We indicate with dots target space Weyl spinor
chirality and with bars worldsheet holomorphicity. The four dimensional
action corresponding to ( 1.228 ) describes a free conformal field
theory. The fields @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath satisfy
free equations of motion, second order for @xmath and first order for
fermionic variables. This theory exhibits an @xmath target-space
supersymmetry ⁶ ⁶ 6 It is interesting to note that, if one considers the
undotted fermions only, the model can be regarded as a topological
B-model on euclidean four-dimensional space and the topological BRST
symmetry is strictly connected to the susy transformations generated by
the dotted charges @xmath and @xmath . .

It is useful to apply to ( 1.228 ) the following change of variables

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.229)
     @xmath      (1.230)
     @xmath      (1.231)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and analogous for @xmath and @xmath . In the first line the reader will
recognize the change of variables ( 1.148 ) introduced in section 1.1.7
to obtain Seiberg’s deformed superspace from my @xmath
non(anti)commutative superspace. This transformation was first
introduced by Vafa and Ooguri in [ 27 ] . In the second and third lines
I have written the worldsheet versions of the chiral supersymmetry
charges and superspace covariant derivatives,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.232)
     @xmath      (1.233)
  -- -------- -- ---------

( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are dressed in this
representation). So, @xmath and @xmath represent the conjugate momenta
to @xmath ’s at fixed @xmath exactly as @xmath ’s represent the same
conjugate momenta at fixed @xmath .

The lagrangian ( 1.228 ) can be rewritten in terms of the new variables
as follows

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.234)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In the presence of D-branes, one obtains the fermionic boundary
conditions

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.235)
     @xmath      (1.236)
  -- -------- -- ---------

that only preserve half of the supersymmetry, generated by the charges
@xmath and @xmath .

It is possible to couple the action to the R-R background described by
the selfdual graviphoton field strength

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.237)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Only in euclidean signature it is possible to turn on the selfdual part
of the super-two-form field strength @xmath while setting the
antiselfdual part @xmath to zero. This is the stringy counterpart of the
discussion we presented in section 1.1.5 for nonanticommutative
superspaces and works exactly the same way.

It is possible to show that the background ( 1.237 ) is an exact
solution of the full nonlinear string equations of motion and that there
is no backreaction to the metric. This can be seen from the fact that a
purely selfdual field strength does not contribute to the energy
momentum tensor and does not involve the dilaton field in its kinetic
term.

In the action the graviphoton field strength couples to the worldsheet
supersymmetry currents @xmath as follows

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.238)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This is actually the graviphoton integrated vertex operator ⁷ ⁷ 7 In
chapter 3 I will give a detailed derivation of the corresponding vertex
operator in the ten-dimensional case. , that in this case gives the
whole dynamics since there is no backreaction.

We are interested in the effect of the background on the dynamics, so we
can concentrate on the @xmath sector, with the lagrangian

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.239)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We can integrate out the fields @xmath and @xmath by using their
equations of motion

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.240)
     @xmath      (1.241)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and obtain the effective lagrangian

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.242)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We obtain boundary conditions for both fermionic variables and their
derivatives

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.243)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.244)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

The first condition breaks half of the supersymmetry on the boundary.
The second one corresponds to the equality of supersymmetry charges
@xmath on the boundary (see the equations of motion 1.241 ). The
boundary conditions for derivatives of @xmath has first appeared in [ 90
] for the GS superstring. In that case they were additional, unexpected
conditions, required by consistency of boundary conditions under
kappa-symmetry. They were shown not to overconstrain the system, because
they arise as restrictions of the field equations to the boundary. In
this case instead the effective action ( 1.239 ), obtained by
integrating out the fermionic conjugate momenta, is second order for the
fermions. A boundary condition for derivatives of @xmath naturally
arises from requiring that there are no surface terms in the
Euler-Lagrange equations of motion.

One can determine the fermionic propagators

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.245)
     @xmath      (1.246)
     @xmath      (1.247)
  -- -------- -- ---------

On the boundary we get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.248)
  -- -------- -- ---------

corresponding to the algebra

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.249)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Since the coordinates @xmath and @xmath are not affected by the
background coupling, they remain commuting. This means that the algebra
written in terms of the original coordinate @xmath involves nontrivial
terms in @xmath and @xmath , as required by consistency and first shown
in my paper [ 26 ] .

In [ 27 ] the deformation ( 1.249 ) was not welcome. It has been shown
that when the open superstring is also coupled to a constant gluino
superfield on the boundary, by adding the following term to the action

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.250)
  -- -------- -- ---------

the superspace deformation ( 1.249 ) is undone and supersymmetry is
restored if the gluino fields satisfy the deformed algebra

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.251)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Instead, in [ 28 ] the supersymmetry-deforming algebra ( 1.249 ) was
accepted and it was shown that in the zero-slope limit the @xmath
theories we discussed in section 1.1.7 naturally emerge in string
theory.

The analysis pursued in [ 28 ] was further developed in [ 53 ] . In this
paper it was shown that the constant selfdual background deforms the
original @xmath superPoincaré algebra into another algebra that has
still eight supercharges, four of which are unaffected by the
background. In the presence of a D-brane, @xmath supersymmetry is
realized linearly and the remaining @xmath is realized nonlinearly. This
interpretation of the new terms arising in the supersymmetry algebra is
similar to the original one we gave in [ 26 ] . There we didn’t consider
the new terms arising in the supersymmetry algebra as symmetry-breaking
terms. We considered them as symmetry-deforming terms and we recast them
in the known form of a q-deformation.

It is very interesting to note that if both selfdual and antiselfdual
field strength are turned on, there is a backreaction that warps
spacetime to euclidean @xmath . The string in this background has been
studied in [ 91 ] and the structure of the action closely resembles the
pure spinor version of the superstring in @xmath [ 88 ] . The action
becomes quadratic in the limit @xmath resembling the Penrose limit in
the ten-dimensional case. @xmath super Yang-Mills on euclidean @xmath
has been studied in [ 92 ] .

A comparison to noncommutativity in the bosonic case is due. First of
all, we notice that the superspace deformation ( 1.249 ) vanishes in the
zero slope limit @xmath unless we also take the limit @xmath . This in
principle can be done since @xmath is an exact solution to the string
equations. Moreover, it is interesting to note that, in
contradistinction to the bosonic case, where the @xmath term only
affects the boundary conditions, the @xmath term only affects the bulk
equations of motion. It would be nice to see if there is a duality
transformation connecting the two cases ⁸ ⁸ 8 In [ 93 ] S-duality was
considered in the context of noncommutative geometry in the presence of
both NS-NS B-field and R-R potentials . .

The four-dimensional results in [ 27 , 28 ] have been generalized to ten
dimensions in [ 29 ] . The main difference between the compactified four
dimensional case and the full ten dimensional case is that a constant
R-R field strength background, represented by a bispinor @xmath , is not
a solution of the ten-dimensional string equations of motion (full
nonlinear type II SUGRA equations), but it is only a solution of the
linearized equations. Therefore in this case there is a backreaction.
Nevertheless, it is possible to compute the corresponding vertex
operator to be added to the action. The resulting theory is not the
complete sigma model. In [ 29 ] it was considered the general case where
a NS-NS constant @xmath , a constant R-R field strength @xmath and
constant gravitinos @xmath @xmath are turned on. The resulting algebra
is characterized by the usual nontrivial bosonic commutator induced by
@xmath , a nontrivial anticommutator between @xmath and @xmath induced
by the R-R field strength and nontrivial commutators between the bosonic
coordinate and the two fermionic ones induced by the two gravitinos. It
would be nice to perform an analogous analysis in the pure spinor
version of the superstring in a p-p wave background [ 94 ] . In this
case the whole sigma model action is known that involves a constant R-R
field strength coupled to fermionic variables in a similar way with
respect to ( 1.242 ).

After the superspace deformation of a theory is known, one can integrate
out the fermionic variables to obtain the component formulation of the
theory. It has been shown in [ 67 ] that the component formulation of
@xmath super Yang-Mills theory can be obtained from standard RNS type
IIB string theory compactified of a Calabi-Yau three-fold in the
presence of a constant graviphoton background with a definite duality. A
graviphoton background can be obtained in euclidean space by wrapping a
R-R 5-form around a 3-cycle of internal Calabi-Yau space. Even if in the
general case the RNS is not suitable to deal with a R-R background, in
the constant graviphoton field strength case there are simplifications
that allow for the computation of tree-level scattering amplitudes on
the disk with the insertion of R-R vertex operators. The method used in
[ 67 ] is intrinsically perturbative, but the results are exact in the
@xmath limit. So the nonanticommutative @xmath super Yang-Mills action
in its component formulation is recovered from RNS string computations.

### 1.3 Generalization to non-constant backgrounds

In this section I would like to discuss some results generalizing the
connection between string theory and noncommutative geometry to the case
of a nonconstant @xmath field. Let us introduce the notation @xmath for
the gauge invariant combination in terms of which the physics of an open
string in the presence of Dp-branes, gauge field @xmath and background
@xmath field is described. The latter will not be constrained to be
constant from now on.

We have to consider three possible situations, of growing complexity

-   constant @xmath

-   nonconstant @xmath , @xmath

-   nonconstant @xmath , @xmath

We have discussed the first case, corresponding to flat D-brane and flat
background, in sections 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.3 . Summarizing the results in
[ 7 ] , in this case the Dp-brane worldvolume is described in terms of
noncommuting coordinates. @xmath defines an associative symplectic
structure associated to the noncommutativity matrix @xmath . In the
limit @xmath physics can be described by an effective theory which is a
gauge theory deformed by the noncommutative associative Moyal product.
In the limit @xmath the noncommutative parameter @xmath is given by the
inverse of @xmath (see 1.180 ).

The second case has been studied in [ 95 ] . It describes a physical
situation with curved Dp-branes in a flat background. The worldvolume
deformation is decribed by Kontsevich @xmath product, where the
noncommutativity parameter is given by the inverse of @xmath , as
before. In this case @xmath is not constant anymore, so neither is
@xmath and the correct product is Kontsevich @xmath . @xmath is still a
Poisson structure on the manifold, that now exhibits a coordinate
dependence such that associativity is satisfied. The formula ( 1.185 ),
valid in the limit @xmath , is generalized to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.252)
  -- -------- -- ---------

being @xmath Kontsevich associative product.

The last case, discussed in [ 96 ] , is a further generalization to the
case where the background is also curved. @xmath is not a Poisson
structure anymore, since associativity is lost. This is related to the
emergence of a second geometrical object playing a role in the physics
of the system. This is the 3-form @xmath , that has been shown to be the
parameter governing nonassociativity. However, it is always possible to
give a description of the Dp-brane worldvolume in terms of a
Kontsevich-like product. Noncommutativity is still governed by @xmath
and nonassociativity by @xmath .

In [ 96 ] a metric @xmath is considered that is a small perturbation
from the flat metric of section 1.2.1. The string action in a generic
curved background is still of the form ( 1.157 ), where the target space
metric is @xmath , describing a curved spacetime. It is possible to
expand the action around the flat spacetime metric as follows

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.253)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath represents the action in a flat spacetime ( 1.157 ) and
@xmath is the first correction due to the presence of a small curvature.

In situations where a curved background is present, it is convenient to
choose special coordinates, known as Riemann normal coordinates, defined
along geodesics in target space starting from @xmath (see for instance [
97 ] , where the normal coordinate expansion of the metric is introduced
in the context of sigma models and string theory). In terms of these
coordinates the Taylor expansion of every tensor around @xmath is
expressed in terms of covariant tensors evaluated at the origin. In
particular, the expansion for the metric up to second order in @xmath is
given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.254)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the curvature tensor. The analogous expansion for the
@xmath field, in radial gauge, is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.255)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath .

In [ 96 ] a first order approximation in @xmath is applied. The action
considered is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.256)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the action ( 1.157 ) for flat @xmath and constant @xmath
, while @xmath is the first order correction in @xmath , deriving from
the @xmath expansion ( 1.255 )

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.257)
  -- -------- -- ---------

@xmath is treated as an interaction term with respect to the free
theory, described by the action @xmath .

The perturbative analysis with the interaction @xmath gives the
following results. In the limit @xmath correlators are expressed in a
form analogous to ( 1.252 )

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.258)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is Kontsevich-like nonassociative product, whose definition
is completely analogous to ( 1.78 , 1.79 ), with @xmath . The relation (
1.70 ) is not valid, though, for the noncommutativity parameter @xmath
and the violation of associativity is proportional to the 3-form @xmath
as follows

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.259)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Note that ( 1.258 ) is problematic, because of the nonassociativity of
@xmath . It is necessary to specify the positions of the points @xmath
on the boundary of the disk, so invariance under cyclic permutations is
lost.

The coordinate algebra is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.260)
  -- -------- -- ---------

showing that the role played by the two-form @xmath is unchanged in the
general curved case. The relations concerning the nonassociativity of
the coordinate algebra are instead

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.261)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.262)
  -- -------- -- ---------

These formulas further clarify the role played by the 3-form @xmath as
the parameter governing nonassociativity.

The deep relationship between spacetime geometry and nonassociativity on
the D-brane worldvolume discovered in [ 96 ] is very interesting,
showing that nonassociative geometry [ 98 ] also plays a role in the new
developments regarding spacetime pioneered by string theory.

It would be nice to generalize the results discussed in this section to
the manifestly target space supersymmetric string (in Green-Schwarz or
Berkovits formalism) to see whether a Kontsevich-like product similar to
the one I proposed in [ 26 ] , in collaboration with D. Klemm and S.
Penati, may emerge in the presence of a nontrivial super-three-form
field strength background .

It would be also interesting to consider a generalization of the
discussion presented in section 1.2.4, where the R-R field strength is
not constant. In particular, when the R-R field strength has a linear
dependence on the bosonic coordinates, it would be nice to investigate
whether Lie algebraic deformed superspaces, characterized by the
fermionic anticommutators

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.263)
  -- -------- -- ---------

can appear. These kind of superspace was first studied in [ 33 ] , in a
different context. There, the authors considered the possibility that
bosonic spacetime had a fermionic substructure, given by the relation (
1.263 ). In [ 32 ] , in collaboration with P. A. Grassi, I have started
to consider this problem by computing the vertex operator for the
Berkovits covariant superstring for a R-R field strength with a linear
dependence on the bosonic coordinates. This will be discussed in detail
in chapter 3.

## Chapter 2 Noncommutative deformation of integrable field theories

### 2.1 A brief introduction to selected topics concerning
two-dimensional classical integrable systems

Disclaimer: This section is not a thorough introduction to the vast
field of integrable systems. I will only review topics needed in the two
following sections, where my study of the noncommutative sine-Gordon
system will be presented. In most cases I will not give details and I
will just give references for the interested reader. Moreover, for any
single topic in this section I will exhibit a single example, the
ordinary sine-Gordon model.

#### 2.1.1 Infinite conserved currents and the bicomplex approach

In classical mechanics a system described by @xmath degrees of freedom
is completely integrable when it is endowed with @xmath conserved
currents. In classical field theory, a system with an infinite number of
local conserved currents is also said to be integrable. This is a
property of the equations of motion. For some integrable system an
action is also known that generates the equations by an Euler-Lagrange
procedure, but this is not true in general. Indeed, it is true for the
sine-Gordon model that I will consider in the rest of this chapter.

By making use of the bicomplex technique [ 99 ] it is possible to
construct second order differential equations that are integrable.
Moreover, with this approach it is very easy to generate the
corresponding conserved currents by an iterative procedure.

In this section we use euclidean signature and complex coordinates

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

A bicomplex is a triple @xmath where @xmath is an @xmath -graded
associative (but not necessarily commutative) algebra, @xmath is the
algebra of functions on @xmath and @xmath are two linear maps satisfying
the conditions @xmath . @xmath is therefore a space of @xmath -forms.
Let us consider the linear equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a real parameter and @xmath for a given “spin” @xmath .
Suppose a nontrivial solution @xmath exists. Expanding it in powers of
the given parameter @xmath as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

one obtains the following equations relating the components @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore we obtain the chain of @xmath -closed and @xmath -exact forms

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

For the chain not to be trivial @xmath must not be @xmath -exact. When
the two differential maps @xmath and @xmath are defined in terms of
ordinary derivatives in @xmath , the conditions @xmath are trivially
satisfied. Therefore, the possibly infinite set of conservation laws (
2.4 ) is not associated to any second order differential equation and it
is not useful for our purpose.

However, it is possible to gauge the bicomplex by dressing the two
differential maps @xmath and @xmath with the connections @xmath and
@xmath as follows

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

The flatness conditions @xmath are now nontrivial and give the
differential equations

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.7)
     @xmath      (2.8)
     @xmath      (2.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

Exactly as before we can consider the linear equation corresponding to (
2.2 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

The nonlinear equations ( 2.9 ) are the compatibility conditions for (
2.10 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

Supposing that the linear equation ( 2.10 ) admits a solution @xmath and
expanding it as @xmath , one obtains the possibly infinite chain of
identities

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

from which @xmath -closed and @xmath -exact forms @xmath can be
constructed, when @xmath is not @xmath -exact. Therefore, with a
suitable choice of @xmath and @xmath , it is possible to construct
interesting second order integrable differential equations from ( 2.9 )
and their conserved currents from ( 2.12 ). In general the currents
@xmath are nonlocal functions of the coordinates, since they may be
expressed in terms of integrals, but it is possible to extract local
currents from them that have a physical meaning.

As an example, we can derive the ordinary sine-Gordon equation from this
formalism. Let @xmath , where @xmath is the space of @xmath matrices
with entries in the algebra of smooth functions on ordinary @xmath and
@xmath is a two-dimensional graded vector space with the @xmath basis
@xmath satisfying @xmath . If we take the differential maps

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

with commuting constant matrices @xmath and @xmath , then the conditions
@xmath are trivially satisfied.

To obtain nontrivial second order differential equations we can gauge
the bicomplex by dressing @xmath as follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath generic invertible matrix in @xmath . The condition @xmath
is trivially satisfied, while @xmath yields the nontrivial second order
differential equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

With the choice

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

and taking @xmath as follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

we obtain the sine-Gordon equation from the off-diagonal part of the
matrix equation ( 2.14 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

The diagonal part instead gives an equation which is trivially
satisfied.

From this derivation it is clear that the bicomplex approach can be
naturally extended to noncommutative space, by replacing ordinary
products with Moyal products in the whole discussion. In particular
@xmath and @xmath and equations ( 2.9 ) are generalized accordingly.
This will be discussed for the sine-Gordon model in section 2.2.4.

Since in the noncommutative case the group @xmath is not closed any more
and must be extended to @xmath , as we have seen in section 1.1.2, it is
natural to expect that the noncommutative generalization of this
construction for the sine-Gordon equation will be nontrivial.

#### 2.1.2 Reductions from selfdual Yang-Mills

The self-duality equations for Yang-Mills fields in @xmath with
signature @xmath or @xmath [ 117 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.19)
     @xmath      (2.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

are a famous example of nonlinear integrable equations in four
dimensions. For @xmath gauge theory the potentials @xmath are real. It
is possible to consider an analytic continuation of @xmath into complex
space parametrized by the complex coordinates @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath . The selfduality equations ( 2.20 ) can be rewritten in the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the last sign is @xmath is the euclidean case and @xmath in the
kleinian case. The first equation in ( 2.21 ) implies that the
potentials @xmath , @xmath ( @xmath , @xmath ) are pure gauges for fixed
@xmath , @xmath ( @xmath , @xmath ), therefore two @xmath complex
matrices @xmath and @xmath can be found such that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.22)
     @xmath      (2.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

Defining @xmath , the last equation can be rewritten as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

describing selfdual Yang-Mills in Yang formulation. This equation
resembles the sum of two WZW model equations (see section 1.1.3)
involving @xmath and @xmath variables, respectively. Therefore Yang
equation ( 2.24 ) can be obtained from the following action

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.25)
              @xmath   @xmath      (2.27)
                                   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a homotopy path satisfying @xmath and @xmath .

Ward conjectured that all integrable equations in @xmath can be obtained
as dimensional reductions of selfdual Yang-Mills equations [ 127 ] , so
that the latter play the role of a universal integrable system. Since
then the conjecture has been tested on many integrable systems [ 118 ]
whose Lax pair can also be obtained by reduction from the one associated
to the selfduality equations ( 2.20 ). The kleinian case is particularly
interesting because of its connections with the @xmath string, discussed
in section 1.2.2.

Reductions are obtained by requiring invariance under any arbitrary
subgroup @xmath of the group of conformal transformations of @xmath (or
@xmath ). Afterwards algebraic constraints can be applied to the
arbitrary matrices involved in the equations to obtain known integrable
models. In most cases invariance under translations in certain
directions is required. Therefore it is clear that there are many more
possibilities in reducing selfdual Yang-Mills in @xmath with respect to
the euclidean case, since, instead of requiring invariance under the
usual complex coordinates

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.28)
     @xmath      (2.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

(combining space with space and time with time), in the kleinian case
one can also require invariance with respect to light-cone coordinates

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.30)
     @xmath      (2.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

(combining space and time).

As an example I will show how ordinary euclidean sine-Gordon model can
be obtained from selfdual Yang-Mills equations.

The euclidean version of Yang equation ( 2.24 ) gives the sine-Gordon
equation if one choses

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . In fact one finds that the field @xmath satisfies ( 2.18
) with @xmath .

It will be also useful to know that the sine-Gordon equation can be
obtained from kleinian selfdual Yang-Mills equations through a two-step
reduction procedure. First of all one requires independence of Yang
equation ( 2.24 ) under one of the real coordinates @xmath , reducing to
the @xmath model

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a constant vector in spacetime. A nonzero @xmath breaks
Lorentz invariance but restores integrability when it is spacelike and
with unit length (nonlinear sigma models in @xmath dimensions can be
Lorentz invariant or integrable but not both [ 127 ] ). From this
equation, in the case @xmath , we can make a further reduction [ 107 ]
by choosing

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath depending on only two coordinates with different signature.
As a result, we obtain the sine Gordon equation in @xmath dimensions for
the field @xmath .

#### 2.1.3 Properties of the S-matrix

In section 2.1.1 we have seen how to construct nonlinear differential
equations in two-dimensions with the property of having an infinite
number of conserved currents. We have also said that from that
construction it is possible to extract conserved currents that are local
and thus have a physical meaning. In this case the corresponding
equations are called integrable. Moreover, we have seen an example of
two-dimensional integrable system, the ordinary sine-Gordon equation.

The S-matrix of a two-dimensional theory with an infinite set of
conserved currents that are local and yield conserved charges which are
components of Lorentz tensors of increasing rank enjoys several nice
properties.

-   The general multiparticle S-matrix is elastic, i.e. the number and
    set of momenta of particles of any given mass remains the same
    before and after the collision.

-   Any multiparticle S-matrix factorizes into a product of two-particle
    S-matrices.

-   These two-particle S-matrices satisfy a cubic equation that in most
    cases is sufficient to obtain exact expressions for them (unitarity
    must be used, though!). The sine-Gordon model is one of these cases.

These are of course very nice properties. Indeed, the task of computing
the general S-matrix considerably simplifies, since it reduces to
determining only the two-body S-matrix.

I’m not going to give a proof of this theorem. The interested reader can
for instance refer to [ 100 ] . The key ingredient in the proof is the
sufficient complexity of the conserved charges (i.e. the growing Lorentz
rank). However, locality is strongly used and its is unclear whether the
kind of nonlocality introduced by the @xmath product can be a problem.
As we discussed in section 1.1.2, unitarity and causality problems arise
in theories with noncommutating time, such as 1+1 theories, together
with a general breakdown of the quantum mechanics framework.

In my paper [ 36 ] , an explicit example of a noncommutative two
dimensional theory with an infinite number of conserved currents that
does not have a factorized S-matrix was constructed. Therefore, it seems
that the theorem cannot be trivially extended to noncommutative case.
However, in my paper [ 37 ] , a noncommutative two-dimensional system
which is integrable and has a factorized S-matrix was constructed. It
might be that a nontrivial interplay between integrability and causality
drives a system to exhibit or not a factorized S-matrix. These issues
will be discussed in the rest of this chapter.

#### 2.1.4 Solitons

The name soliton refers to solutions of nonlinear equations that
represent a localized packet travelling without changing shape or
velocity and preserving these properties after collision with other
packets. In complicated equations containing nonlinear and dispersive
terms, the existence of this kind of solution is a highly nontrivial
property, due to a special balance between the effects of these two
kinds of contributions.

A very famous example of a system displaying this kind of classical
solutions is the sine-Gordon model. It can be shown that this system,
described by the equation of motion ( 2.18 ), admits the following
static finite-energy solution

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

(soliton) and the corresponding one (antisoliton) obtained by the
discrete transformation @xmath , which is a symmetry of the system.
Moving solutions can be obtained from static ones by Lorentz
transformation. A third kind of solution is present, called doublet or
breather solution, which can be interpreted as a bound system made of a
soliton-antisoliton pair. For a detailed derivation of these solutions
the reader should refer to [ 100 ] . It can be shown by studying exact
time-dependent solutions representing scattering of solitons that the
colliding solitons do not change shape or velocity after collision. From
direct inspection of these scattering solutions, representing two (or
more) (anti)solitons far apart and approaching with a relative velocity,
it is clear that the only effect of the collision in the distant future
is some time delay (see [ 100 ] ).

Solitons solutions are not present in any scalar field theory with a
potential bounded from below in spatial dimension greater than two, as
the energy of any field configuration can always be lowered by
shrinking. This follows from a simple scaling argument by Derrick [ 101
] .

Let us consider a theory for a single scalar field in D+1 dimensions for
simplicity (the discussion can be easily extended to a set of @xmath
interacting scalar fields), described by the standard relativistic
lagrangian. The corresponding energy functional for static
configurations is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

Let @xmath be an extremum of ( 2.36 ). Consider the energy of the
configuration @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since we assumed that @xmath is an extremum, we require @xmath . This
gives the equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

If the potential @xmath is bounded from below by zero and @xmath , than
kinetic and potential terms in this equation must vanish separately and
thus no nontrivial space-dependent solutions are admitted. In the case
@xmath one obtains that @xmath . If @xmath has only discrete minima,
then also in @xmath no time-dependent solutions are allowed. However,
when @xmath has a continuos set of minima (in the case with more than
one scalar field), possible space-dependent solutions are permitted.

Notice that this proof is not valid when higher derivative terms are
present and when the scalar field is described by a nonrelativistic
lagrangian. Moreover, only static solutions are excluded, while
time-dependent ones are allowed.

### 2.2 Deforming an integrable field theory: The sine-Gordon model (a
first attempt)

#### 2.2.1 Noncommutative solitons

In this section I will mostly refer to the ICTP lectures by R. Gopakumar
[ 11 ] . To the interested reader, I also suggest the lectures by N.
Nekrasov [ 12 ] and by J. Harvey [ 13 ] . Since the literature
