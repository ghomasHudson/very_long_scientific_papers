### 6.1 Datasets

The experimental evaluation of different approaches, reported in this
chapter, was carried out on two object images datasets, including the
Restaurant Object Dataset (Kasaei et al., 2015a ) and the Washington
RGB-D Object Dataset (Lai et al., 2011b ) . In this chapter, we mainly
use the restaurant object dataset for evaluating the performances of the
proposed approaches because it has a small number of classes with
significant intra-class variation, which is suitable for performing
extensive sets of experiments. The Washington RGB-D object dataset is
used for evaluating the GOOD descriptor with respect to several
characteristics. The following subsections describe these datasets in
more detail.
