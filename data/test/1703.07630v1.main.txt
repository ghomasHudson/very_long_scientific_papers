#### Resumen

Una de las plataformas más prometedoras para superconductividad
topológica en una dimensión está basada en nanohilos semiconductores con
fuerte acoplamiento de espín-órbita (AEO), donde se induce
superconductividad de onda @xmath vía efecto de proximidad y un campo
Zeeman externo conduce al sistema hacia la fase topológica con estados
ligados de Majorana (ELM) en los bordes del nanohilo. Durante los
últimos años, esta idea ha dado lugar a un gran número de experimentos
en sistemas híbridos superconductor-semiconductor, donde la principal
característica is la emergencia de un pico a voltaje cero en la
conductancia diferencial a medida que el campo magnético es aumentado.

Esta tesis se centra en el estudio de uniones híbridas
superconductor-semiconductor hechas de nanohilos semiconductores con AEO
de tipo Rashba. En la primera parte, introducimos la emergencia de
superconductividad topológica en una dimensión, y luego mostramos como
modelar uniones híbridas en una dimensión hechas de nanohilos
semiconductores con AEO. Después, realizamos un análisis detallado del
espectro de Andreev y del transporte dependiente de la fase, el cual
exhibe características no triviales in la fase topológica con ELM. En la
segunda parte, nos centramos en transporte dependiente del voltaje en
una union corta superconductor-normal-superconductor (SNS) hecha de
nanohilos semiconductores con AEO, a medida que el campo Zeeman aplicado
conduce al sistema hacia la fase topológica superconductora. Mostramos
que la corriente disipativa de las múltiples reflexiones de Andreev
(MAR) a diferentes transparencias de la unión exhibe propiedades
relacionadas a la topología, tales como la inversión del gap, la
formación de ELM y la conservación de la paridad fermiónica. En la
tercera parte, hacemos un estudio detallado de helicidad y confinamiento
en uniones largas SNS basadas en nanohilos semiconductores. La
conclusión más importante de esta parte es que una unión larga con una
región helical, pero todavía en el régimen topologicamente trivial,
contiene un espectro de baja energía dentro del gap que consiste en
cruces múltiples en energía cero que evolucionan suavemente hacia ELM a
medida que la unión se hace topológica. En la cuarta parte, investigamos
un nuevo enfoque para diseñar ELM en nanohilos superconductores no
topológicos, donde proponemos crear una unión normal-superconductor (NS)
suficientemente transparente en un nanohilo de tipo Rashba, con una
parte en la fase topológicamente trivial y la otra en la fase helical
normal. Terminamos con un análisis de propiedades de apantallamiento en
nanohilos superconductores con AEO y campo Zeeman dentro de la teoría de
respuesta lineal, relevante para experimentos que intentan medir ELM y
su solapamiento no trivial. A lo largo de esta tesis, hacemos hincapié
en la importancia del emplear uniones híbridas
superconductor-semiconductor de nanohilos para la detección sin
ambigüedades de ELM mas allá de la anomalía a voltaje cero.

## Chapter \thechapter Introduction

### 1 Overview of the research in the field

The discovery of new materials based on condensed matter systems led to
a large number of technological applications mainly because it was
possible to identify, characterise and classify matter in different
states. In all these states, matter is formed by a substantial number of
constituents ordered in different phases that correspond to different
internal structures or orders, which are associated with symmetries.

The common framework to describe and classify such emergent phases at
the quantum level is based on Landau’s Fermi liquid theory [ 1 ] and the
Ginzburg-Landau theory of symmetry breaking [ 2 ] . In Landau’s Fermi
liquid theory, the low-energy excitations (near the Fermi surface) in an
interacting Fermi liquid can be considered as non-interacting
quasiparticles with renormalised properties such as mass, velocity, etc.
However, such picture is not longer valid at low temperatures because
some systems are unstable towards phases that are characterized by a
local order parameter. At high temperature entropy dominates and leads
to a disordered state, while at low temperature energy dominates and
leads to an ordered state. Therefore, an ordered phase appears at low
temperature when the system spontaneously loses one of the symmetries
present at high temperatures: namely, phase transitions, described by
Ginzburg-Landau theory [ 1 ] , occur where some of the symmetries
presented in the system are broken. Hence, based on a classification
made according to the concept of symmetry breaking, there exist many
possible arrangements that originate states such crystalline solids,
which break translation symmetry; liquid crystals, which break
rotational but not translational symmetry; magnets, which break
time-reversal symmetry and rotational symmetry of the spin space;
superconductors, which break the more subtle gauge symmetry leading to
novel phenomena such as flux quantisation and Josephson effects, among
others.

During the last decades there has been a bunch of theoretical and
experimental discoveries, which do not fit into the above picture. These
new phases of matter do not break any symmetry but instead exhibit
fundamental properties robust to smooth changes in materials parameters
that do not change unless the system experiments a quantum phase
transition. Such phases, referred to as topological phases , do not have
a local order parameter, but they rather posses a so-called topological
order parameter [ 3 , 4 ] . Consequently, a description based on the
Ginzburg-Landau theory of symmetry-breaking fails.

In mathematics, topology studies whether objects can be deformed
smoothly into each other, without creating a hole in the deformation
process [ 5 ] . The concept of topological invariance, and therefore
topological invariants, was introduced to classify different geometrical
objects into broad classes. For instance, 2D surfaces are classified by
their number of holes. In condensed matter physics, on the other hand,
one considers Hamiltonians with an energy gap separating the ground
state from the excited states, where a smooth deformation is defined as
a change in the Hamiltonian that does not close the energy gap. If two
gapped Hamiltonians can be continuously transformed into each other
without closing the energy gap, then it is said that these two systems
are topologically equivalent [ 6 ] . These classes are distinguished by
a topological invariant called the Chern number [ 5 ] . This Chern
number is a well defined integer in the absence of band crossings
(gapped subbands). It can therefore only change value when subbands
cross, or reconnect, as an external parameter is varied. The process
where two gapped Hamiltonians cannot be continuously transformed into
each other without closing the energy gap, implies a change in the
topological invariant, the Chern number, and such process is called
topological phase transition . A fundamental consequence of the
topological classification of gapped band structures is the existence of
gapless conducting states at interfaces where the topological invariant
changes [ 6 , 7 ] .

In the late 80’s the discoveries of the Integer Quantum Hall effect
(IQHE) [ 8 ] and later on its fractional (FQHE) counterpart [ 9 ] were
well described by the previous ideas. These experiments investigated the
motion of electrons confined to two dimensions and exposed to a strong
perpendicular magnetic field at low temperatures. The experiments
reported that this state is characterised by an energy gap between the
ground state and the excited states, a quantised Hall conductance,
@xmath and a vanishing longitudinal resistance, where integer values of
@xmath stands for the IQHE and fractional values of @xmath for the FQHE.
In the quantum Hall state the bulk of the two-dimensional sample is
insulating and the electric current is carried along the edge of the
sample, only. The flow of this unidirectional current does not exhibit
dissipation and leads to the quantisation of the Hall conductance.
Astonishingly, the value of the Hall conductance is determined by the
ratio of two fundamental constants, and therefore is independent of any
properties of the material being measured, disorder or other macroscopic
details. Afterwards, it was demonstrated that the quantisation of the
Hall conductance, is related to the Chern number [ 3 ] , and therefore
the Hall state is a result of a topological phase. As discussed above, a
consequence of the topological classification of gapped band structures
is the existence of gapless conducting states at the interfaces where
the topological invariant changes [ 6 , 7 ] . The electronic states
between the integer Hall effect and vacuum are chiral in the sense that
they propagate in one direction only along the edge. Physically, the
Chern number determines the number of these chiral states, which
propagate along the edge of the sample. Due to this chirality, these
chiral states are robust against disorder, due to the absence of
counter-propagating modes in which to backscatter, and carry electric
current without dissipation [ 6 , 7 ] .

Later, the two-dimensional quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) in HgTe/CdTe
quantum wells [ 10 , 11 ] and its three-dimensional counterpart in
bismuth chalcogenides [ 12 , 13 ] were predicted and discovered. The QSH
state is the first example of the so-called two-dimensional topological
insulator. Unlike the Hall effect described before, which breaks
time-reversal symmetry, these new quantum states (QSHE) belong to a new
class of materials called topological insulators, which are invariant
under time-reversal and in which spin-orbit coupling plays a key role [
6 , 7 ] . The QSH state is invariant under time-reversal, has a charge
excitation gap in the 2D bulk, but has topologically protected 1D
gapless edge states that lie inside the bulk insulating gap [ 3 , 4 , 14
] . Unlike the QHS, the edge states in the QSHS are distinct: two states
in with opposite spin polarization counter propagate at a given edge [
14 , 15 , 16 , 17 ] . For this reason, these states are also known as
helical , where the spin is correlated with the direction of motion [ 16
] . In this case, time-reversal symmetry prevents the helical edge
states from backscattering [ 6 , 7 ] . The spectrum of a QSHS cannot be
smoothly deformed into another of a topologically trivial insulator
without helical states, thus representing a new topologically distinct
state of matter. These topological insulators can be characterized by a
@xmath topological invariant, which is determined from the band
structure [ 15 , 17 ] . The helical states in the QSHS can be viewed as
two copies of chiral edge states of the QHS related by time-reversal
symmetry.

The search and study of topological phases in superconductors started
even before topological insulators [ 18 ] , but it was until the
classification of topological insulators that similar ideas were used to
topologically classify superconductors [ 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 ] . Indeed,
there is a direct analogy between insulators and superconductors because
the equations that describe quasiparticles in a superconductor or
superfluids like He @xmath , the so-called Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG)
equations, have a similar mathematical formulation as the Dirac equation
for topological insulators, with the superconducting gap corresponding
to the band gap of the insulator. In superconductors, additionally to
the time-reversal symmetry in topological insulators, one finds
charge-conjugation or electron-hole symmetry. These two symmetries and
the product of the two of them (chiral or sublattice symmetry) led to
the classification of topological superconductors [ 20 ] . As in
topological insulators, here we also find time-reversal invariant and
breaking topological superconductors, where the former is classified [
19 , 20 , 21 , 22 ] by a @xmath invariant in 1D and 2D and a @xmath
invariant in 3D, while the latter are classified by an integer [ 23 ] in
a similar fashion as the Quantum Hall insulators [ 3 ] . It is important
to mention here that when time-reversal is present the systems belong to
the BDI class, while for time-reversal breaking to the D class [ 19 , 21
] . The ones that have attracted much attention during last years are
the time-reversal breaking topological superconductors, mainly because
they are related with non-Abelian statistics with potential application
to topological quantum computation [ 24 ] .

In 2D, the integer classification of topological superconductors is very
similar to that of topological insulators. Indeed, a QHS with Chern
number @xmath has @xmath chiral edge states, while a chiral
superconductor with topological number @xmath has @xmath chiral Majorana
edge states, which resemble the ones in the QHS but with electron-hole
redundancy [ 6 , 7 ] . The simplest platform in 2D for a topological
superconductor consists of a spinless superconductor with @xmath
symmetry [ 25 , 26 ] , while a spinless superconductor with @xmath
symmetry is the simplest one in 1D [ 27 ] . These superconductors
support topological phases that host chiral Majorana edge states
propagating at the boundary of domain-walls (regions that break
time-reversal invariance), while a vortex binds a stable Majorana zero
mode [ 28 , 23 , 29 ] . Similarly, in 1D the system hosts Majorana zero
modes bound at its boundaries with trivial (non-topological) regions
(one Majorana bound state at each end of the 1D system). These modes
were named after Ettore Majorana, who introduced a similar concept in
the context of high energy physics, where a Majorana fermion is a
fermionic particle that is identical to its own anti-particle [ 30 , 31
] . In condensed matter, superconductors offer a natural platform for
studying these exotic modes, since non-degenerate quasiparticle
excitations in superconductors at zero energy indeed exhibit such
Majorana character [ 32 , 29 ] , where a particle is identical to its
anti-particle. These phenomena have attracted massive theoretical
interest during last years mainly because these zero modes represent the
simplest case of non-Abelian anyons with profound implications in
topological quantum computation [ 27 , 24 , 33 ] . Although the pairing
symmetry, @xmath in 1D and @xmath in 2D, of the required superconductors
can rarely emerge intrinsically, there are some important cases where
nature does it for us. The first proposal was the fractional quantum
Hall effect state at filling fraction @xmath [ 23 ] and later experiment
on Sr @xmath RuO @xmath compound provided evidence as the best
experimental candidate for topological superconductivity with @xmath [
34 ] , similar to the A-phase in a superfluid liquid He @xmath [ 35 , 36
] . Despite the efforts, conclusive signatures of such exotic @xmath
-wave superconductivity are still missing.

Even though @xmath -wave and @xmath pairings are not robust against
disorder and thus scarce in nature, a number of platforms were proposed
in order to engineer such non-trivial superconductivity. These ideas
have attracted enormous attention because they are based on combining
traditional well-known effects in condensed matter physics, where all
existing proposals are based on @xmath -superconductors, representing an
advantage over intrinsic non-trivial superconductivity. Indeed, Fu and
Kane [ 37 ] proposed to proximitize the surface of a 3D topological
insulator with an @xmath -wave superconductor, where below the
superconductor critical temperature, the high transparency of the
contacts gives rise to proximity-induced superconductivity, thus
generating a 2D topological superconductor. The surface of a topological
insulator hosts a single Dirac cone. Then, for any chemical potential
residing within the bulk gap there is only one single Fermi surface,
since the Dirac cone is non-degenerate, and therefore the spinless
regime can be achieved. Electrons along this Fermi surface are not
spin-polarised, so @xmath pairing can be effectively induced on the
surface of the 3D topological insulator by a conventional @xmath -wave
superconductor via proximity effect. The key ingredient for inducing
such non-trivial pairing is based on the strong spin-orbit interaction,
an intrinsic property of topological insulators, which gives rise to
spin-momentum locking. Time-reversal breaking of any form will generate
chiral Majorana edge states at the boundary between topologically
superconducting and magnetically gapped regions in the surface of a 3D
topological insulator. Moreover, a magnetic field creates a vortex on
the surface, which can trap midgap states, and therefore bind a stable
Majorana zero mode. As it was pointed out previously, these zero modes
possess special properties that can be used in topological quantum
computation [ 27 , 24 , 33 ] . In fact, a well separated pair of
Majorana bound states forms a fermionic two-level system, a qubit, which
can be either occupied or empty defining a non-local qubit. Remarkably,
the quantum information in this qubit is stored non-locally leading to
long coherence times, which is a necessary requirement for robust
quantum computing [ 27 , 24 , 33 ] . The topological protection in these
systems relies on the presence of a non-zero gap for quasiparticle
excitations [ 24 ] . Following Fu and Kane’s groundbreaking proposal
described above, many authors pursued alternative approaches towards
engineering two one dimensional, @xmath and @xmath , superconductors,
where semiconductor-based proposals are actively investigated [ 38 , 39
] .

Along these lines, nanowire research has acquired another flavor due to
the possibility of creating one-dimensional counterparts of topological
surface states. The simplest model for engineering topological
superconductivity in one-dimension is based on spinless fermions, an
idea developed by Kitaev [ 27 ] . It consists of a chain of spinless
fermions that supports a topological phase with Majorana bound states at
each end. Interestingly, it was theoretically shown that it is possible
to engineer the Kitaev’s model only by considering traditional
ingredients such as s-wave superconductivity and a spin texture that can
be provided by strong Rashba spin-orbit and Zeeman interactions [ 40 ,
41 ] , rotating Zeeman fields [ 42 ] , or RKKY interaction [ 43 ] .
These one-dimensional structures are thought to possess several distinct
advantages when it comes to fabrication and subsequent detection of the
Majorana zero modes. Here, the system becomes spinless by applying a
Zeeman field that opens a gap, while strong spin-orbit interaction
guarantees that there is a finite antiparallel spin component between
opposite momenta within each electronic band and therefore the induced
superconducting pairing opens a quasiparticle excitation gap. In quantum
wires, Majoranas occur either at the wire ends or at a domain wall
between topological and non-topological regions of the wire. Unlike
their two-dimensional counterparts, Majorana bound states in nanowires
do not require the presence of a vortex in the system, eliminating
decoherence which arises from low lying vortex-core quasiparticle
states. Most importantly, the topological superconducting phase with
Majoranas can be reached by varying the chemical potential, which can be
tuned using gates, or by increasing the external magnetic field. This
tunability makes nanowires the most promising scheme for the detection
of Majorana bound states in condensed matter systems. Although a number
of experiments have been reported [ 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 ] ,
still new geometries and studies are needed.

In this thesis we consider the platform based on nanowires with strong
Rashba spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman interaction [ 40 , 41 ] , and then
investigate hybrid superconductor-semiconductor junctions made up of
these nanowires.

### 2 Fermionic and Majorana operators

Systems of many-body particles are appropriately described within the
second quantisation formalism, where states are denoted by @xmath and
identified by the number of particles @xmath in each single-particle
state @xmath . For fermions, @xmath denotes an occupied or empty state.
Now, we define the fermionic creation operator @xmath , for the single
particle state, as an operator which increases @xmath by one if the
state @xmath is empty, @xmath , and give zero otherwise, @xmath .
Likewise, we define the fermionic annihilation operator @xmath , which
decreases @xmath by one if the state @xmath is occupied, @xmath , and
give zero otherwise, @xmath . Any state can be constructed by successive
applications of creation operators on the states with no particles, the
vacuum states. The occupation number operator is defined as @xmath ,
which measures the number of particles in state @xmath . Due to the
antisymmetry of the fermionic state @xmath , creation and annihilation
operators fulfil the following anti-commutation relations [ 50 ] ,

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (1)
  -- -------- -- -----

where @xmath is the Kronecker delta. Any physical operator can be
written in terms of the creation and annihilation operators we have
defined above [ 50 ] . Now, we introduce a new kind of operators based
on a decomposition of a Dirac (complex) fermion in terms of two real
operators, known as Majorana operators [ 27 ] ,

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (2)
  -- -------- -- -----

where a Majorana operator is usually understood as half of a normal
fermionic operator. In fact, any fermion operator can be defined in
terms of Majorana operators, and a description in terms of these new
operators is usually helpful in systems where the number of particles is
only conserved modulo @xmath [ 27 ] , as in superconducting systems.

The inverse transformation of Eqs. ( 2 ) gives us the Majorana
operators,

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (3)
  -- -------- -- -----

These new operators @xmath satisfy the following algebra

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (4)
  -- -------- -- -----

Any fermionic operator that satisfies previous conditions is a Majorana
fermion operator, where the second expression indeed expresses the
essence of a Majorana fermion: a particle created by the operator @xmath
is identical to its antiparticle created by @xmath . The term Majorana
refers to the real nature of such operators, as in the Majorana’s
representation of the Dirac’s equation in particle physics [ 30 ] . The
condensed matter counterparts, considered here, however, are not
connected with the Majorana’s original idea and its application to
neutrinos [ 30 ] . Despite the little connection between these two
views, the terminology is extensively used by the condensed matter
community. If additionally, the Majorana operator @xmath from Eq. ( 3 )
commutes with the systems’s Hamiltonian,

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (5)
  -- -------- -- -----

then it represents a Majorana zero mode (MZM) and because these zero
modes emerge bound to defects it is also common to call them Majorana
bound states (MBS) [ 51 , 29 , 52 , 53 , 54 ] . This phenomenon has no
analogy in particle physics and it is in condensed matter physics that
such Majorana zero modes have acquired an enormous interest due to their
potential application in topological quantum computation [ 27 ] . Later,
in Sec. 4 , we will describe in more detail these zero modes in
one-dimensional systems. For now, the main condition for the emergence
of a Majorana fermion in condensed matter systems is: a particle being
its own anti-particle . Notice that Eqs. ( 4 ) constitute a linear
combination of creation and annihilation operators, thus a natural
platform for investigating the emergence of these exotic physics
includes superconducting systems as we will see later. Previous
discussion is rather ideal and in realistic physical systems, however,
the condition given by Eq. ( 5 ) is hardly fulfilled, and in general one
has,

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (6)
  -- -------- -- -----

where @xmath represents the separation between two MBSs, and @xmath the
correlation length associated with the Hamiltonian @xmath . Notice that
for long enough @xmath , Eq. ( 6 ) indeed implies Eq. ( 5 ), and the
condition for a Majorana zero mode is fulfilled.

The fermion (occupation) number operator, in terms of the Majorana
operators, read

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (7)
  -- -------- -- -----

then the expectation values of the number operator follow

  -- -- -- -----
           (8)
  -- -- -- -----

For superconducting systems, the particle number operator @xmath does
not commute with the Hamiltonian. Instead, we define the number parity
operator as

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (9)
  -- -------- -- -----

which anti-commutes with the Majorana operators @xmath , and commutes
with a Hamiltonian being quadratic in the fermionic creation and
annihilation operators @xmath . Thus, taking into account Eq. ( 8 ),

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (10)
  -- -------- -- ------

which implies that the eigenstates of @xmath can be divided in states
with even and odd parity.

### 3 Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism for superconductivity

As we have pointed out previously introduction, superconductivity
provides a natural platform for investigating Majorana physics in
condensed matter systems. Thus, in this part we describe the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism of the BCS ¹ ¹ 1 Named after John
Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Robert Schrieffer (BCS) [ 55 ] theory of
superconductivity [ 55 ] , which describes quasiparticle excitations in
superconductors. The BCS Hamiltonian emerges from Eq. ( 195 ) by making
the assumption that, at low temperatures even a weak attractive
interaction ² ² 2 In conventional (singlet) superconductors, as the one
discussed next, the attraction is due to an exchange of phonons.
However, magnetic interactions, for instance, can also induce attraction
between electrons favouring triplet pairing with a non-zero spin of the
pair. between electrons near the Fermi surface enables the formation of
bound pairs of time-reversed states ( @xmath ) and ( @xmath ), called
Cooper pairs [ 56 ] . Then, considering only the terms decisive for
superconductivity, we write down the so-called reduced Hamiltonian [ 57
]

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (11)
  -- -------- -- ------

where the first term is the free electron term, @xmath with @xmath the
effective electron’s mass and @xmath the Planck’s constant, second term
describes the scattering of Cooper pairs with momenta @xmath into
another pair with momenta @xmath with amplitude @xmath . In the previous
Hamiltonian, we have introduced the second quantization representation,
where @xmath ( @xmath ) is the creation (annihilation) operator which
creates (destroys) an electron with momentum @xmath and spin @xmath .
Exact analytical treatment of Eq. ( 11 ) is complicated and therefore it
is usual to follow the mean-field approach. This is justified by taking
into account the fact that the ground state of the BCS Hamiltonian is a
coherent many-body state, and therefore the pair of operators such as
@xmath can have non-zero expectation values in such ground state, unlike
averaging to zero in a normal metal. Moreover, since now we deal with a
huge number of particles, fluctuations about these expectation values
are expected to be rather small, and therefore some really small terms
are neglected. For details see Appendix A . Then, after some algebra, we
arrive at the Hamiltonian in the mean field approximation,

  -- -- -- ------
           (12)
  -- -- -- ------

where we have defined @xmath , which is in general complex and it
represents the pairing potential or superconducting order parameter, and
@xmath is taken over the BCS ground state. The symmetry of @xmath is
intrinsic from the superconducting material, and it can give rise to
superconductors with different properties. See Appendix A for a brief
discussion on singlet and triplet superconducting pairings. Here, we
consider @xmath -wave pairing, where electrons of different spin and
momenta are paired together as given by Eq. ( 12 ). From here on, we
consider @xmath as for @xmath -wave symmetry the pairing potential is
independent of @xmath . Now, when studying superconducting systems, it
is standard to treat electrons and holes at the same footing. Therefore,
it is appropriate to introduce a new set of spinors @xmath , where
previous Hamiltonian can be written as, see Appendix for more details,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (13)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is known as the Nambu spinor [ 58 ] . Then, previous, and

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (14)
  -- -------- -- ------

is the so-called Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian [ 59 ] , where @xmath
and @xmath , @xmath , are Pauli matrices acting on the electron-hole and
spin subspaces ³ ³ 3 The matrices @xmath and @xmath act on the spin and
particle-hole degree of freedom, respectively:

@xmath

. Notice that we have considered the superconducting pairing as @xmath ,
where @xmath is the superconducting phase. Moreover, due to inversion
asymmetry, @xmath , the spectrum is invariant under @xmath , and the BdG
Hamiltonian can be written as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (15)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath denotes the complex conjugation operation and in the
following represented by the operator @xmath , and @xmath . Now, we aim
at diagonalizing @xmath , which is done by finding the eigenvalues of
@xmath , since the second term in Eq. ( 13 ) is constant and therefore
can be neglected. The eigenvalue problem,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (16)
  -- -------- -- ------

gives rise to the so-called Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations and @xmath is
a four component vector (two for electron and two for hole) [ 58 ] . The
Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian, @xmath , is Hermitian and acts on
spinors @xmath , whose first half is formed out of annihilation
operators of electrons and the second half out of creation operators of
the same electrons. The second half with creation operators of the same
electrons can be viewed as annihilation operators of an extra set of
holes, so that we introduce a redundant description, where the amount of
degrees of freedom are doubled in the system. The off-diagonal blocks of
@xmath couple electrons and holes in opposite spins bands switched by
the spin Pauli matrix @xmath via the pairing potential @xmath [ 54 ] .

This relation between electrons and holes automatically imposes a
symmetry on @xmath : the so-called electron-hole or charge-conjugation
symmetry. In the spinor basis given by @xmath , each eigenfunction
@xmath of @xmath at energy @xmath has a copy @xmath at @xmath , where
the Pauli matrix @xmath switches electrons and holes [ 54 ] . The action
of such symmetry converts an electron into a hole and vice versa and it
is represented by an anti-unitary operator @xmath , where the Pauli
matrix @xmath acts on the electron-hole subspaces, @xmath on the spin
sector and @xmath is the complex conjugation operator. Then, one can
show that @xmath . Thus, due to the minus sign, the spectrum of @xmath
must be symmetric around zero energy: for every vector @xmath of @xmath
with energy @xmath , there is an electron-hole symmetric eigenvector
@xmath with energy @xmath . Notice that the Hamiltonian given by Eq. (
14 ) can also be written in the alternative basis given by @xmath . In
this basis, however, the particle-hole symmetry equals @xmath .
Important, although the explicit form of the particle-hole operator
depends on the spinor basis, both @xmath and @xmath are anti-unitary and
square to @xmath and the physics discussed here does not depend on it.

The eigenvalues of @xmath , found after solving Eq. ( 16 ), represent
the energy spectrum of quasiparticle excitations in a superconductor,
known in the literature as Bogoliubov quasiparticles [ 59 , 57 , 58 ] ,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (17)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath represent the dispersion of free electrons in a normal
metal, while @xmath represents the @xmath -wave superconducting pairing
potential, which couples electrons and holes. After finding the
eigenvalues of @xmath , given by previous equations, one is now able to
think that there is a new basis in which the mean-field Hamiltonian is
diagonal, up to a constant term that we have dropped off, see second
term in Eq. ( 13 ), and therefore we can write

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (18)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath , @xmath . The operators @xmath are fermionic and create
quasiparticles with energies @xmath , respectively. The relation between
operators @xmath and @xmath is given by an unitary matrix formed by the
eigenvectors of @xmath , which gives rise to the Bogoliubov
transformation ⁴ ⁴ 4 Bogoliubov-Valatin transformation in the Russian
literature, although along this thesis we will refer to as Bogoliubov
transformation, only. , see Appendix A for further details on the
derivation,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (19)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath and @xmath are the so-called coherence factors and given
by,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (20)
  -- -------- -- ------

and satisfy @xmath . The quasiparticle operators given by Eqs. ( 19 )
are not independent and indeed one notices that @xmath is connected to
@xmath , leading to only two independent quasiparticle operators, due to
the redundant description we have introduced with the Bogoliubov-de
Gennes description.

The spectrum shown in Fig. 1 , given by Eq. ( 17 ), is two-fold
degenerate due to spin, so that in principle there are four bands. This
degeneracy can be lifted by applying a Zeeman magnetic field for
instance. At zero pairing potential, @xmath , the spectrum consists of
two parabolas for electrons and two for holes. Superconductivity opens
an energy gap of @xmath at the Fermi points in the spectrum, giving rise
to energy bands, which are a mixture of electron and hole. This can be
further seen from Eqs. ( 19 ), where quasiparticles created (destroyed)
by operators @xmath ( @xmath ) are a linear combination of electron and
hole @xmath operators with opposite spins and represent the elementary
excitations in a superconductor. Notice that the spectrum shown in Fig.
1 is similar to the one of a band insulator with fine-tuned
particle-hole symmetry, with the sole difference that quasiparticles in
a superconductor are mixture of electrons and holes, as given by Eqs. (
19 ).

The energy @xmath is the lowest single-particle excitation energy in the
superconducting state. Since particles are paired to form Cooper pairs
in the ground state, it is not possible to excite individual
quasiparticles with energy @xmath , but rather one must break such pairs
and excite them to the sea of Bogolibov quasiparticles represented by
the band @xmath . The minimum of energy needed for breaking a Cooper
pair corresponds to @xmath , and it determines the pairing energy.
Cooper pairs maintain their correlation within a length called the
coherence length, and following the BCS theory it is defined as [ 59 ,
57 , 58 ]

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (21)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the Fermi velocity in the superconductor and @xmath is
the zero temperature superconducting pairing ⁵ ⁵ 5 In general, we have
defined: @xmath . This equation can be written as @xmath , which
constitutes a self-consistency equation for the pairing potential @xmath
and it is known as the BCS gap equation [ 59 , 57 , 58 ] . Within the
BCS approach, @xmath , singlet pairing, which do no depend on momentum
@xmath . Then @xmath , where @xmath given by Eq. ( 17 ). From this
equation one can calculate the dependence on the temperature of pairing
potential @xmath . Then, taking the zero temperature limit one can show
that in the weak-coupling limit @xmath , where @xmath is the Debye
energy that characterises the cutoff of the phonon spectrum, and @xmath
is the density of states at the Fermi level for electrons of one spin
projection. Now, considering that at the critical temperature, @xmath ,
the pairing potential vanishes @xmath , one can show that @xmath holds
for conventional low- @xmath superconductors. . In previous definition,
we have assumed zero temperature and a superconductor without
impurities. In alloys with a mean-free path @xmath , the coherence
length follows @xmath [ 57 ] .

Another special result of the BCS theory was on the density of states in
the superconductor: @xmath , where @xmath is the density of states at
the Fermi energy in the normal state assumed constant within @xmath .
Then, according to Eq. ( 17 ), @xmath for @xmath exhibits divergences at
the gap edges @xmath giving rise to the van Hove singularities of the
superconducting spectrum ⁶ ⁶ 6 These peaks are also known as coherence
peaks. , and zero within the gap of width @xmath , as shown in Fig. 1 [
59 , 57 , 58 ] . The fact that there are no states within @xmath is
based on the nature of our @xmath -wave superconductor and supported by
the Anderson’s theorem ⁷ ⁷ 7 states that an @xmath -wave superconductor
does not host states within the gap at zero magnetic field [ 60 ] . [ 60
]

As we have already discussed, the eigenvalues of the Bogoliubov-de
Gennes Hamiltonian come in pairs due to electron-hole symmetry, and it
is schematically shown in Fig. 3 . Thus, in a superconductor, the
creation of a quasiparticle with energy @xmath is identical to the
annihilation of a quasiparticle with energy @xmath . This idea can be
seen in the quasiparticle operators given by Eqs. ( 19 ), where @xmath .

We have pointed out in Sec. 2 that superconducting systems are natural
platforms for investigating the emergence of Majorana physics in
condensed matter systems. The main condition we described was based on a
particle being its own anti-particle. This property is represented in
terms of Majorana operators by the relation @xmath . As already
discussed, electron-hole symmetry in @xmath -wave superconductors
introduces somehow a similar condition, @xmath . The condition for
having a particle which is its own antiparticle must therefore occur at
zero energy. However, the problem with @xmath -wave superconductors is
evidently the spin due to spin degeneracy, and therefore the zero energy
state is not robust. Thus, it is not always obvious how to impose this
condition in trivial superconductors, such as @xmath -wave, due to spin
degeneracy. This is the reason why spinless or spin-polarised
superconductors are required, and in the next section we discuss the
simplest proposal in one dimension.

### 4 One-dimensional topological superconductivity

In this part we introduce the Kitaev’s proposal [ 27 ] , a model to
engineer Majorana bound states in one-dimensional quantum wires based on
@xmath -wave superconductivity. It describes a 1D system of fermions
with the same spin that can be viewed as spin-polarized or spinless. The
model consists of a chain with N sites, where each site can be empty or
occupied by a fermion

  -- -- -- ------
           (22)
  -- -- -- ------

where @xmath represents the onsite energy, @xmath is the
nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude and @xmath is the superconducting
pairing potential between nearest neighbors sites (assumed real for now)
and with lattice spacing @xmath , see Fig. 4 (a).

The operator @xmath creates (destroys) a spinless fermion at site @xmath
. Fermions obey the following anti-commutation relations

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (23)
  -- -------- -- ------

For a better understanding of how Majorana zero modes emerge, let us
first consider the situation of a chain with open boundary conditions,
and then write the Eq. ( 22 ) in the Majorana basis.

As we have introduced in Sec. 2 , any fermion operator can be defined in
terms of two new operators, Eqs. ( 2 ) and their inverse Eqs. ( 3 ),
known as Majorana operators, see Fig. 4 (b). Although sometimes it does
not lead to any novelty but rather it complicates the problem, we will
show that in this situation such decomposition leads to interesting
physics. Therefore, the Hamiltonian given by Eq. ( 22 ) in terms of
these new operators reads (see Appendix Hybrid
superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful platforms to
study Majorana bound states for more details on the derivation)

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (24)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath represent hopping amplitudes between
Majorana fermions of the same fermionic site @xmath , between the first
Majorana of site @xmath with the second Majorana of site @xmath , and
between the second Majorana of site @xmath with the first Majorana of
site @xmath , respectively. Fig. 5 shows the situation we have described
here.

The Hamiltonian given by Eq ( 24 ) exhibit different interesting
properties depending on the values of the system parameters, @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath . Such properties belong to the emergence of different
quantum phases. Now, we illustrate the difference between the
topological and trivial phases by looking at two special limits.

The trivial phase: For @xmath , the Hamiltonian given by Eq. ( 24 )
reads

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (25)
  -- -------- -- ------

Previous sum tells us that Majorana operators from the same physical
site are paired together to form a fermion and the ground state is given
by all fermion states empty ( @xmath ) or occupied ( @xmath ). See Fig.
5 (b). At this point nothing special happens and the system is
topologically trivial.

The topological phase: On the other hand, an interesting situation
happens when @xmath and @xmath . Indeed, for the former, Eq. ( 24 )
acquires the following form,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (26)
  -- -------- -- ------

Remarkably, @xmath does not contain operators @xmath and @xmath and only
Majorana operators on adjacent lattice sites are coupled, as sketched in
Fig. 5 (c). These operators that do not appear in the Hamiltonian
represent zero-energy Majorana modes localized at the ends of the chain.
Since such operators are not coupled to any Majorana operator, they
commute with the Hamiltonian @xmath .

Now, we can define a new set of fermionic operators that involve only
Majorana operators included in the Hamiltonian given by Eq. ( 24 ),

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (27)
  -- -------- -- ------

Hence, in terms of these new operators, Eq. ( 24 ) reads

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (28)
  -- -------- -- ------

which can be further written as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (29)
  -- -------- -- ------

with ground state energy @xmath for @xmath .

One realises that the two unpaired Majorana operators residing at the
ends of the chain, @xmath and @xmath , can be fused into an ordinary
fermion operator, hence

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (30)
  -- -------- -- ------

This fermion is delocalised with contributions from both ends of the
chain, and since it is absent in Eq. ( 28 ) to occupy its quasiparticle
state requires zero energy. One can check that the space formed by all
the ground states @xmath of @xmath can be written using the operators
@xmath and @xmath defined above. The occupation number operator is
@xmath and can be used to label the ground state, which exhibits a
two-fold degeneracy arising from the two possible occupancies @xmath of
the ordinary fermion state @xmath . The two ground states indeed are
@xmath , which satisfies @xmath and the other ground state can be
defined as @xmath . One notices that @xmath , implying that @xmath and
@xmath are two different ground states and that indeed the ground state
degeneracy of the Kitaev’s model in the topological regime is two-fold.

The parity state defines a degenerate two-level system, a qubit, so that
it can be used to encode quantum information [ 27 ] . Since the
definition of such number operator state takes into account the zero
energy fermion operator made of two Majorana operators at the end of the
chain, the fermion state cannot be measured with any local measurement
on one of the bound states at the end of the chain: such parity state
can be accessed by a joint measurement of the two Majoranas. This is the
reason why it is considered that the information in such a quit is
stored non-locally [ 27 ] .

Up to this part, we have discussed the two distinct phases that exhibits
the Kitaev’s model: a trivial phase and the topological phase with
unpaired Majorana zero modes located at the end of the chain. Now, in
order to investigate the properties of the superconducting bulk without
perturbations from the ends of the chain and to fully describe the two
phases we have studied previously, we assume that the chain forms a
closed loop with periodic boundary conditions. This requires to add an
extra term in the Hamiltonian given by Eq. ( 22 )

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (31)
  -- -------- -- ------

Hence, the Hamiltonian given by Eq. ( 22 ), reads

  -- -- -- ------
           (32)
  -- -- -- ------

Notice that the addition of the extra term implies that the second sum
runs till site @xmath and allows interactions between sites @xmath and
@xmath . The consideration of periodic boundary conditions is achieved
by requiring that sites @xmath and @xmath correspond to the same site,
so that @xmath and @xmath . Indeed, this is the closed loop assumption
we have made. It is thus appropriate to consider the Hamiltonian given
by Eq. ( 32 ) in momentum space @xmath ; and since electrons and holes
are involved in the problem, it is useful to rewrite the momentum
Hamiltonian in Nambu space, see App. Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor
nanowire junctions as useful platforms to study Majorana bound states
for more details,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (33)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath defines a Nambu operator and @xmath is the so-called
Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (34)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath . The energy spectrum of
@xmath is then given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (35)
  -- -------- -- ------

For @xmath , the energy gap closes when both elements inside the square
root vanish simultaneously: @xmath and @xmath . The former vanishes at
isolated points @xmath and @xmath . Hence, for @xmath , @xmath , while
for @xmath , @xmath . Previous can be understood by considering that the
superconducting pairing @xmath has @xmath -wave nature, being an odd
function in @xmath , thereby Cooper pairs are prohibited to form at
@xmath or @xmath . This closing of the energy gap represent a special
kind of phase transition and it is called topological phase transition
for reasons that will be understood below. The two lines @xmath separate
two gapped superconducting phases, @xmath and @xmath , that are
connected only by making zero the gap of the energy spectrum.

When @xmath is much smaller than the relevant energy scales in the
problem, these two phases can be distinguished by means of topological
invariants as briefly discussed in the introduction. In the case of
one-dimensional superconductors such topological invariant is the
Majorana number [ 27 ] @xmath , where @xmath represents the number of
pairs of Fermi points in the Brillouin zone of the normal system (
@xmath ). Remarkably, when restoring superconductivity ( @xmath ) the
system becomes a topological superconductor with Majorana zero modes
located at the ends of the system: odd number of pairs of Fermi points
indicates the emergence of the topological phase, while even of the
trivial one. Notice that this topological invariant cannot be changed in
a continuous way without closing the gap of the spectrum as discussed
above. For @xmath , the number of pairs of Fermi points is odd and
therefore the Majorana number is @xmath . See Fig. 6 . It represents the
existence of Majorana zero modes and confirms the discussion we have
made in the geometry with open boundary conditions. On the other hand
@xmath is a trivial phase. We conclude this part by pointing out that
along this thesis we will refer to these Majorana zero modes bounded at
the ends of the chain as to Majorana bound states (MBSs).

In general, for a small but non-zero @xmath , the Majorana bound states
are not really localise at the ends of the wire, but their
wave-functions exhibit an exponential decay into the bulk of the wire,
@xmath , see Eq. ( 6 ). The non-zero spatial overlap of the two Majorana
wave-functions results in a non-zero energy splitting between the two
Majorana states. For long enough wires the splitting is very small that
the two Majorana states can be considered to be degenerate. Moreover,
the Majoranas can also split when the higher-energy states in the bulk
come very close to zero energy, hence the Majorana modes are protected
as long as the bulk energy gap is finite. This follows from the
particle-hole symmetry involved in the problem, where the spectrum has
to be symmetric around zero energy. Therefore, trying to move the
Majorana zero modes from zero energy individually is impossible, as it
would violate particle-hole symmetry.

Therefore, we conclude that Majorana bound states at the end of the
Kitaev’s chain are protected by electron-hole symmetry, and by the
absence of zero-energy excitations in the bulk of the wire, and not by
fine tuning of the model’s parameters.

### 5 Physical realization based on nanowires with Rashba spin-orbit
coupling

A promising physical realisation for engineering topological
superconductivity in one dimension based on the Kitaev’s model is
schematically shown in Fig. 7 . It involves one-dimensional
semiconducting nanowires with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) (such as
InSb, InAs), where conventional @xmath -wave superconductivity is
induced by proximity effect and an external Zeeman field, perpendicular
to the spin-orbit axis, drives the system into the topological
superconducting phase with Majorana bound states at the end of the wire
[ 41 , 61 ] . Along this thesis, we will refer to a nanowire with Rashba
SOC as to Rashba nanowire. The idea is such that the normal system, with
zero superconductivity, can support an odd number of pairs of Fermi
points for a given chemical potential, similar to the normal system in
the Kitaev’s proposal, and therefore when switching on superconductivity
a topological superconducting phase emerges hosting Majorana bound
states at each end of the wire. To understand how the topological phase
arises in this system, it is worth to firstly describe the normal state
of the nanowire.

Before going further we point out that for investigating topological
superconductivity one really needs a spin texture an @xmath -wave
superconductivity. For the proposal we discuss along this thesis, the
interplay of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman interaction gives
rise to the spin-texture, however, other systems as chains of magnetic
atoms [ 62 , 43 , 63 , 64 , 65 ] or topological insulators [ 37 , 66 , 6
, 7 ] can also lead to similar conclusions. The calculations we present
along this chapter and in the rest of this thesis correspond to typical
parameters for InSb. For reviews see for instance [ 51 , 29 , 52 , 53 ,
54 ] .

#### Nanowire with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman interaction

We consider a single channel nanowire in one-dimension ⁸ ⁸ 8 The radius
of the wire is small compared to the Fermi wavelength and there is a
single 1D occupied mode. with SOC and Zeeman interaction, whose
Hamiltonian is given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (36)
  -- -------- -- ------

where the first, second and third terms are the kinetic, spin-orbit
coupling and Zeeman Hamiltonians, respectively. We refer to @xmath as to
the for the normal system Hamiltonian to distinguish it from the
superconducting one to be described next. The kinetic term reads

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (37)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the effective electron’s mass in the nanowire and @xmath
the chemical potential, which determines the filling of the nanowire.
The spin-orbit coupling Hamiltonian is described by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (38)
  -- -------- -- ------

where the spin direction is such that @xmath , @xmath is the vector of
Pauli matrices, @xmath denotes the spin direction along the @xmath
-axis, and @xmath represents the strength of Rashba spin-orbit coupling.
The Zeeman Hamiltonian associated to the magnetic field @xmath along the
the nanowire @xmath -axis, perpendicular to the spin-orbit axis,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (39)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the Zeeman energy, @xmath is the applied magnetic field,
@xmath is the wire’s @xmath -factor and @xmath the Bohr magneton. In the
previous Hamiltonians, @xmath represents the annihilation operator of an
electron at position @xmath with spin @xmath . The fact that we require
the Zeeman and the spin-orbit axes to be perpendicular will become clear
later. For a discussion on the effects of a parallel field see Appendix
C . It is appropriate to introduce the Hamiltonian density @xmath

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (40)
  -- -------- -- ------

where the Hamiltonian density reads

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (41)
  -- -------- -- ------

and @xmath is the momentum operator. Typical values for InSb nanowires [
67 ] include the electron’s effective mass @xmath and the spin-orbit
strength @xmath meVnm. Mostly along this thesis we will refer to
Hamiltonian densities denoted by @xmath simply as to Hamiltonians
without loss of generality.

The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of previous Hamiltonian, @xmath , are
found by solving the Schrodinger equation @xmath . In terms of plane
waves @xmath , see Appendix C for details on the derivation, we get

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (42)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath , and @xmath .

In Fig. 8 , we present the energy dispersion for the nanowire with
Rashba SOC and Zeeman interaction, which is given by Eq. ( 42 ). The top
left panel of Fig. 8 shows the energy dispersion of the free electron
Hamiltonian that consists of two superimposed parabolas, one for each
spin. The value of the chemical potential @xmath is measured from the
bottom of the band and determines the filling of the nanowire. The
spin-orbit coupling shift the two parabolas, which cross at zero
momentum @xmath , by momenta @xmath and by energy @xmath , see top right
panel in Fig. 8 . The spin of the two electronic bands is aligned along
@xmath . Up to this part, one can clearly notices that there is no
possibility to mimic the topological phase when superconductivity is
applied in a similar way as it was done in the Kitaev’s approach, since
for any @xmath there are two pairs of Fermi points which corresponds to
an even number and thus to a trivial phase. An external magnetic field,
if perpendicular to the spin-orbit field, solves this issue (bottom
panels). Indeed, a Zeeman magnetic field @xmath lifts the spin
degeneracy at @xmath by removing the level crossing and opens a gap in
the spectrum of @xmath at zero momentum @xmath . When the chemical
potential @xmath is tuned to be inside the gap opened by the Zeeman
field @xmath , the system hosts an odd number of pairs of Fermi points
(two Fermi points, red filled circles), thus only the lowest band is
partially occupied and the nanowire behaves as spinless. Therefore, the
system can reach the topological superconducting phase by placing the
nanowire on a @xmath -wave superconductor. When the chemical potential
lies within this anti-crossing gap, the system has two Fermi points, as
opposed to four Fermi points for above or below this gap. This window is
a helical gap , since the two fermi points correspond to counter
propagating states with different spins (the spin projection is locked
to momentum) and hence the name helical. Therefore, a nanowire with
@xmath is helical and along this thesis we will refer to it as to
helical nanowire . As mentioned, when the chemical potential lies within
this helical gap, the wire is spin polarised and it appears spinless.
Turning on a @xmath -wave pairing weakly compared to @xmath , then
effectively @xmath -wave pairs states and therefore drives the system
into the topological phase. We will see that the helical regime plays an
important role in normal transport in hybrid junctions (see Chap. Hybrid
superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful platforms to
study Majorana bound states ) and it is crucial towards the emergence of
the topological superconducting phase as we will see later in this
thesis.

Electrons in the semiconducting nanowire feel an effective
superconducting pairing potential as a result of the so-called proximity
effect [ 68 , 69 ] . To occur such effect, a good interface between the
wire and superconductor should be made, so that electrons can tunnel
between these two systems. Within the BCS theory, @xmath -wave
superconducting pairing couples states with opposite momenta @xmath and
spin and can be described by a phenomenological or reduced Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (43)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the pairing potential, which is complex in general but
for now we will consider it to be real, and @xmath is the
superconducting phase. The full system is now described by the sum of
Eqs. ( 40 ) and  ( 43 ),

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (44)
  -- -------- -- ------

Again, when dealing with superconducting systems, it is appropriate to
make use of the Bogoliubov formalism described in Sec. 3 . Therefore,
the full Hamiltonian, @xmath , can be then written in Nambu space by
defining new spinors @xmath , so that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (45)
  -- -------- -- ------

where,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (46)
  -- -------- -- ------

is the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian. The Pauli matrices @xmath and
@xmath act in spin and electron-hole subspaces, respectively. The energy
spectrum of Hamiltonian ( 46 ) is then given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (47)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the free electron energy dispersion.

First, we analyse the role of superconductivity in the energy spectrum
given by previous equation without analysing the emergence of the
topological phase, see Fig. 9 . The band spectrum, additionally to the
normal regime, contains an inverted parabola (left-top panel) that
corresponds to the kinetic Hamiltonian of a hole due to the Nambu
description. Introducing spin-orbit, (right-top panel), such parabolas
split and cross at @xmath , while the Zeeman field opens a gap of @xmath
at @xmath , as shown in Fig. 8 . (bottom panels) The superconducting
pairing @xmath modifies the energy spectrum and it opens a gap at each
Fermi point encircled with dashed green circles (bottom row). Moreover,
notice that the superconducting pairing opens gaps mixing different
bands at finite energy (Magenta dashed circles). In the following we
discuss in more detail the dependence of the gaps at @xmath on the
Zeeman field.

Eq. ( 47 ) allows us to investigate the evolution of the energy spectrum
with the Zeeman field and the emergence of MBSs. It is, however,
instructive to write down the Hamiltonians given by Eqs. ( 40 ) and ( 43
) in the basis constructed from Eqs. ( 42 ) as follows [ 39 , 51 ] ,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (48)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath are operators that annihilates states in the upper/lower
bands at momentum @xmath with energy @xmath and @xmath the respective
normalized wave-functions calculated previously and given by Eq. ( 42 ).
From here on we will refer to this basis as to helical . We can
decompose previous equations into the two spinor components, for details
see Appendix C , thus

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (49)
  -- -------- -- ------

In this basis, the Hamiltonian @xmath is diagonal, see Appendix C . By
introducing Eqs. ( 49 ) into Eqs. ( 40 ) and ( 43 ), we get for the full
Hamiltonian in this new basis, see Appendix C ,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (50)
  -- -------- -- ------

where

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (51)
  -- -------- -- ------

represent the different pairing functions that arise in our nanowire due
to the interplay of Rashba SOC and Zeeman interaction when placed on a
@xmath -wave superconductor. The first line of Eq. ( 50 ) is just the
normal Rashba nanowire Hamiltonian, while in the second line, the first
and second terms associated to @xmath , describe pairing between states
of the same @xmath band, while the third term associated to @xmath ,
represents pairing between states of different band. Moreover, it is
important to notice that @xmath are odd functions of momentum @xmath ,
while @xmath is even. This implies that @xmath is an interband @xmath
-wave pairing, while @xmath is an intraband @xmath -wave pairing. Eq. (
50 ) can be written in Nambu space, see Appendix C.3 ,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (52)
  -- -------- -- ------

where the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian reads

  -- -- -- ------
           (53)
  -- -- -- ------

The eigenvalues of @xmath are given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (54)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath are given by Eq. ( 42 ) and @xmath by Eqs. ( 51 ).

As we have already discussed, the @xmath -wave pairing opens gaps in the
energy spectrum given by Eq. ( 54 ), as shown in Fig. ( 9 ). Now, we
concentrate on the gaps opened at the Fermi momenta @xmath . The energy
band that experiments such gap opening is the lower band @xmath .
Therefore, we define the two gaps opened by @xmath as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (55)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the lower band given by Eq. ( 54 ) and @xmath the Fermi
momenta given by Eq. ( 274 ). Notice that @xmath corresponds to a low
momentum gap @xmath , while @xmath to higher momentum @xmath . Since the
Fermi momenta depend on the spin-orbit, Zeeman interaction and chemical
potential, the gaps will behave differently for increasing such
parameters. Experimentally, however, it is more reliable to vary the
Zeeman field @xmath or chemical potential @xmath than the spin-orbit
coupling strength @xmath . Thus, it is then natural to assume fixed SOC
and vary @xmath or @xmath . It is important to notice that the energy
spectrum given by Eq. ( 54 ) at @xmath reads

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (56)
  -- -------- -- ------

Remarkably, from Eq. ( 56 ), we observe that this lower band is zero,
@xmath , when Zeeman field reaches @xmath , otherwise it is finite, then

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (57)
  -- -------- -- ------

where

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (58)
  -- -------- -- ------

is the critical field at which @xmath . This point signals a phase
transition between two gapped phases. It was shown that these two phases
are topologically different and @xmath defines the topological phase
transition into a topological superconducting phase with MBSs [ 41 , 61
] . As in the Kitaev’s model [ 27 ] , the topological invariant that
distinguish these phases is the Majorana number @xmath , where @xmath is
the number of pairs of Fermi points in the normal dispersion (see Fig. 8
). The system host an odd number of pairs of Fermi points when @xmath is
within the helical gap, @xmath . Fig. 10 shows the behaviour of the two
gaps as function of @xmath for different values of the spin-orbit
coupling strength. Observe that the low momentum gap, @xmath , firstly
decreases as the Zeeman field increases, reaching zero at @xmath . By
further increasing the Zeeman field, it increases linearly with @xmath .

On the other hand, the higher momentum gap, @xmath , is strongly
dependent on the spin-orbit coupling. Indeed, it decreases for a small
values of @xmath but it is finite for all relevant fields. However,
notice that for strong spin-orbit coupling the gap @xmath remains
constant for all fields.

In Fig. 11 , we show the energy bands evolution given by Eq. ( 54 ) as
one increases the Zeeman field @xmath . At @xmath , a non-zero
superconducting pairing @xmath opens a gap of @xmath at the Fermi points
@xmath given by Eqs. ( 274 ) and marked with green circles in Fig. 9 .
Moreover, it modifies the gap at @xmath as seen in Eq. ( 56 ). We have
seen that the spin-orbit coupling splits NW states into two subbands of
opposite helicity at @xmath , see Figs. 8 and 9 . At finite @xmath ,
these two subbands, which we label @xmath and @xmath , have spins canted
away from the SO axis. The s-wave pairing @xmath , expressed in the
@xmath basis, takes the form of an intraband @xmath -wave @xmath , plus
an interband @xmath -wave pairing @xmath [ 51 ] , given by Eqs. ( 51 ).
Without the latter, the problem decouples into two independent @xmath
-wave superconductors, while @xmath can be understood as a weak coupling
between them. Now, we identify two sectors, associated to the two
subband denoted by @xmath . The energy gaps @xmath and @xmath , defined
by Eqs. ( 51 ), for each sector @xmath arise as soon as the Zeeman field
is switched on and have a different dependence on the Zeeman field
@xmath : the former represents the energy gap at small momentum @xmath ,
while the latter at high momentum @xmath . As one increases the Zeeman
field, @xmath remains roughly constant for strong spin-orbit coupling [
70 , 71 ] , while @xmath gets reduced as can be seen in Fig. 11 (top
middle and top right panels). Remarkably, as the Zeeman field approaches
the critical field @xmath , @xmath vanishes (roughly) linearly, see Fig.
10 . For @xmath , @xmath is zero and becomes centered at @xmath , Fig.
11 (bottom left panel). By further increasing the Zeeman field @xmath ,
@xmath reopens and follows @xmath , the zero momentum energy of the
lowest subband, see Fig. 11 (bottom middle and right panels). This
closing and reopening of the energy gap @xmath , also known as gap
inversion, signals a topological transition, induced by the effective
removal of the @xmath sector away from the low-energy problem (see
discussion in next paragraph). Below @xmath the NW is composed of two
spinless p-wave superconductors, and is therefore topologically trivial.
Above @xmath , @xmath is no longer a p-wave gap, but rather a normal
(Zeeman) spectral gap already present in the normal state, transforming
the wire into a single-species @xmath -wave superconductor with
non-trivial topology. This phase contains MBSs, protected by the
effective gap @xmath , at the wire ends. Above a certain field @xmath ,
the gap @xmath saturates at @xmath and the physics of superconducting
helical edge states in spin-Hall insulators is recovered [ 66 , 72 ] ,
see Fig. 10 . Indeed, in the following we show that for high Zeeman
fields @xmath , the Hamiltonian @xmath given by Eq. ( 50 ) can be
connected onto the Kitaev’s model hosting Majorana bound states.

To have a further insight of the previous discussion, the system has to
exhibit @xmath -wave pairing symmetry according to the Kitaev’s model.
Thus, it is convenient to project the system Hamiltonian onto the lower
band @xmath . This is allowed because for reaching the topological phase
one needs strong Zeeman field, then the upper band @xmath , see Fig. 11
, can be removed from the low-energy problem. Therefore, we can write,

  -- -- -- ------
           (59)
  -- -- -- ------

where the superconducting pairing potential, or order parameter,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (60)
  -- -------- -- ------

has @xmath -wave symmetry. Now, we write previous Hamiltonian in the BdG
form,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (61)
  -- -------- -- ------

where

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (62)
  -- -------- -- ------

whose energy spectrum is given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (63)
  -- -------- -- ------

Previous equation is in essence the energy spectrum of a @xmath -wave
superconductor, thus being in concordance with the Kitaev’s model
described in previous section. Therefore, it is not a coincidence that
the model given by the Hamiltonian Eq. ( 44 ) indeed describes
Majorana-like physics when @xmath .

From the point of view of topology, the infinite, Zeeman polarised,
single-channel semiconducting nanowire in proximity to a conventional
@xmath -wave superconductor, described in this section, belongs to the
so called one-dimensional D class [ 73 ] , which has an invariant @xmath
that may be @xmath (topologically trivial) or @xmath (non-trivial). This
system undergoes a band topological transition from @xmath to @xmath
when the Zeeman splitting @xmath , perpendicular to the spin-orbit axis,
exceeds a critical value @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath are the wire’s
Fermi energy and induced gap respectively.

An interface between a @xmath semi-infinite wire (with @xmath ) and
vacuum ( @xmath ) binds a single subgap state [ 20 , 74 ] . The state is
pinned to zero energy by the particle-hole symmetry of the Bogoliubov-de
Gennes description, locked strictly midway between electrons and holes;
it satisfies the Majorana condition @xmath , and is hence known as a
MBS. This robust pinning is broken when two MBSs are brought within a
finite distance of each other, i.e. in a topological superconducting
nanowire of finite length @xmath , see left panel in Fig. 12 . Both MBSs
then overlap and hybridize into a single conventional fermion of finite
energy, or Andreev bound state. Right panel in Fig. 12 presents the
evolution of the wire spectrum with @xmath , showing the energy
splitting of MBSs for @xmath . The energy splitting can be small for
long enough wires, though strictly speaking it is non-zero for any
length [ 75 , 70 , 71 , 76 ] . The MBSs become merely quasi-stationary
states, with their energy splitting representing a Rabi frequency at
which one oscillates into the other. See Chap. 10 for details on the
calculation of the spectrum presented in Fig. 12 .

The wave-functions of the MBSs exponentially decay into the bulk of the
superconducting wire [ 76 , 77 ] and can be approximately write down for
@xmath as @xmath , where @xmath is the effective coherence length and
@xmath the effective Fermi wave vector associated with the zero-mode
solution [ 76 ] . The relevant decay length characterising this overlap
is the effective coherence length @xmath and we refer to it as to the
Majorana localisation length denoted later by @xmath , which tells us
how well are MBSs localised at the ends of the wire. For a finite
spatial overlap between their wave-functions, the MBSs acquire a finite
energy and they are not longer true zero modes, thus for @xmath [ 76 ]

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (64)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the effective electron’s mass in the nanowire, and
@xmath is the wire’s length. Notice that such energy splitting exhibits
an oscillating behaviour in the system parameters @xmath and @xmath
through @xmath . We also notice that for sufficiently long wires, @xmath
, the energy splitting can be very small so that it can be assumed to be
zero @xmath .

To conclude this section, we remark that we have described in detail the
platform for engineering Majorana bound states in nanowires with strong
Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in proximity to an @xmath -wave
superconductor, where an external Zeeman field, perpendicular to the
spin-orbit axis, drives the system into the topological superconducting
phase [ 41 , 61 ] . The topological phase transition is controlled by
increasing the Zeeman field and the topological phase is determined by
the presence of two Majorana bound states, one at each end of the wire,
which can be splitted in energy or not depending on the relation between
the length of the wire and the Majorana localisation length.

### 6 Experimental signatures

Although recent experiments have focused on diverse theoretical
proposals, in this section we aim at giving a brief description of the
ones based on Rashba nanowires in proximity to @xmath -wave
superconductors [ 41 , 61 ] . This platform has attracted serious
attention mainly because all the ingredients are well-known phenomena in
condensed matter. As we have explained in the two previous sections,
according to theory, signatures Majorana physics in quantum wires
implies to find Majorana bound states at each end of the wire. For the
system to host such zero modes, there has to be a topological phase
transition as the applied external Zeeman field increases, which is
distinguishable by observing the closing and reopening of the gap.

Following these ideas, a nanowire with Rashba SOC can be partially
placed on a @xmath -wave superconductor, where the portion in contact
with the superconductor acquires superconducting correlations by the
induced proximity effect and we refer to it as to the superconducting
part S, while the other portion of the wire does not contain
superconductivity and therefore is refereed to as to the normal part N.
When the applied Zeeman field exceeds the critical field, @xmath , the S
part becomes topological superconducting and therefore host Majorana
bound states emerge at its two ends, one at each end. This configuration
gives rise to the hybrid geometry known as NS junction, and offers a
number of advantages over superconducting nanowires in that it allows
for contacting the junction with gates and thus tune its chemical
potential. Indeed, superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices can be
assembled from semiconductor nanowires individually contacted by
superconductor electrodes. Below the superconductor critical
temperature, the high transparency of the contacts gives rise to
proximity-induced superconductivity. The nanowires form superconducting
weak links operating as mesoscopic Josephson junctions with electrically
tunable coupling [ 78 ] . This allows to study a wealth of fundamental
physical phenomena in a tunable and well controlled manner. Now, the
matter is how one should proceed in order to measure the presence of
these MBSs or at least one of them in NS junctions.

In a NS junction, the S part possesses a superconducting order
parameter, which make the energy spectrum in S gapped, while N remains
metallic. An electron traveling towards the NS interface is not
transmitted since there are no states within the gap of S, but it is
rather reflected as a hole. This process is known as Andreev reflection
and will be discussed in more detail in Sec. 9 . The general relation
between the conductance of a single mode NS junction and the Andreev
reflection probability is given by @xmath , where the factor of @xmath
arises because the Andreev reflection of an electron into a hole doubles
the current and @xmath is the Andreev reflection probability which
depends on the nature of the interface [ 79 ] . Since @xmath , there is
no time-reversal symmetry and therefore Kramers degeneracy does not
apply. The system still possesses particle-hole symmetry, which requires
that any @xmath is two-fold degenerate (Beri degeneracy [ 80 ] ) with
exceptions for @xmath and @xmath , which may be non-degenerate. It was
shown that a right-moving electron from N experiments an Andreev
reflection probability from a MBS (a zero energy state within the gap)
which is non-degenerate and pinned to unity, @xmath , thus producing a
quantised conductance of @xmath at zero energy (the energy of the MBS),
whereas without the MBS the conductance vanishes [ 81 , 82 , 83 , 84 ,
29 ] . On the other hand, all other Andreev reflected modes are two-fold
degenerate and the conductance become @xmath . Therefore, measuring the
conductance at zero energy constitutes a powerful tool for detecting the
presence or absence of MBSs in a NS hybrid junction when MBSs emerge at
the ends of the S region.

By applying electrostatic gates at the NS contact, one makes a tunnel
junction between the N and S parts of the NS junction. Then, under an
applied voltage bias @xmath across the junction, we can measure the
tunneling current @xmath through this weak link. In the tunneling regime
the differential conductance @xmath is proportional to the density of
states at the end of the superconducting region, which is adjacent to
the tunneling contact. The density of states, to a very good
approximation, measures the conductance of a NS junction. Therefore, one
expects that as the Zeeman field increases the differential conductance
@xmath should trace the gap closing and reopening, which leads to the
topological superconducting phase with a peak at @xmath of high @xmath .
This peak is referred to as zero-bias peak (ZBP) or zero-bias anomaly
(ZBA). During the last years, this approach was extensively pursued
experimentally in hybrid NS junctions made of nanowires, looking for the
zero-bias peak in the conductance across such junction when the S part
becomes topological.

We point out that the observation of a zero-bias peak in the conductance
is not the unique condition for testing MBSs in nanowires. Stronger
evidence could be provided by the observation of non-Abelian
interference (braiding) [ 85 ] , or by transport in phase-sensitive
superconductor-normal-superconductor (SNS) junctions. The latter
approach, which typically involves the measurement of an anomalous
“fractional” @xmath -periodic ac Josephson effect [ 86 , 66 , 87 ] , is
much less demanding than performing braiding. Realistically, however,
the fractional effect, detected through, e.g., the absence of odd steps
in Shapiro experiments [ 87 , 88 , 89 , 90 ] , may be difficult to
measure (dissipation is expected to destroy it in the steady state), or
may even develop without relation to topology [ 91 ] . Although it has
been shown that the @xmath periodicity survives in the dynamics, such as
noise and transients [ 72 , 92 , 93 ] , simpler experimental probes of
MBSs are extremely desirable. On the other hand, it has been proposed to
employ T-junctions in order to test braiding statistics in one-dimension
[ 94 ] , however, on the experimental side it still represents a major
challenge than measuring the zero-bias peak in conductance.

Regarding the materials, InAs [ 46 ] and InSb nanowires [ 95 ] are known
to have strong spin-orbit interaction, @xmath meVnm and @xmath meVnm,
and large @xmath -factor [ 46 , 96 ] . Indeed, the @xmath -factor in
bulk InAs and InSb is very large, @xmath and @xmath , respectively,
which makes such nanowires to accept high Zeeman fields as a result of
the applied magnetic field. Indeed, when a good proximity effect between
the nanowire with an s-wave superconductor is generated, the large
@xmath -factors allow for exceptionally weak fields to drive the wire
into a topological superconductor with MBSs. The strong spin-orbit
coupling further allows this topological state to possess a relatively
large gap that remains robust against disorder [ 97 ] . A relatively
good proximity effect was measured in both systems [ 69 , 98 , 99 ] ,
making them promising for the search of MBSs.

Following these ideas, the first evidence was reported by the Delft
group [ 67 ] . In this experiment the geometry was similar to the NS
junctions described above. They employed an InSb semiconductor
quasi-one-dimensional wire with strong spin-orbit coupling partially
deposited on a substrate equipped with gates and contacted with
superconducting (niobium titanium nitride) and normal metal electrodes
as shown in Fig. 13 (b). The presence of the MBS at the end of the
superconducting section adjacent to the NS interface of the wire was
tested by measuring the tunnelling current @xmath through the weak link,
created between the superconducting and normal electrodes, under an
applied bias @xmath . In this setup, the differential conductance @xmath
is proportional to the density of states in the superconducting end
adjacent to the tunnelling contact. By increasing the magnetic field, a
clear zero-bias peak was observed for a range of magnetic fields of
@xmath T @xmath mT, and disappearing for higher fields, see Fig. 13 (a).
These results support the existence of MBSs in NS junctions, however, a
number of features related to the emergence of MBSs are missing. Indeed,
the value of the zero-bias quantized conductance was smaller than the
predicted, @xmath ), and the experiment does not show the gap closing
and reopening for entering into the topological phase, when such
zero-bias peak emerge, as predicted by theory. Theoretical studies
attribute this softness of the induced superconducting gap to disorder
at the semiconductor-superconductor interface [ 100 ] and to multiple
subbands [ 101 , 102 ] .

Additional experimental observations of the existence of Majorana
quasiparticles were subsequently reported by several independent groups,
showing the celebrated zero-bias peak at non-zero magnetic field [ 45 ,
46 , 47 , 48 , 49 ] . All these experiments point towards the clear
evidence of MBSs in NWs, although it was shown that detection of sub-gap
zero modes through zero-bias peaks in transport can be obscured, or even
mimicked by other effects, such as owing to Kondo physics [ 103 , 47 ,
48 , 104 ] , disorder [ 101 , 105 , 83 , 106 ] , smooth confinement [ 70
, 107 ] , parity crossings of Andreev levels [ 49 , 104 ] .

In all previous experiments a characteristic zero-bias tunnelling peak
appearing at finite magnetic field have been reported, where in all
cases a soft gap is also seen, indicated by sizable subgap conductance [
45 , 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 ] . As mentioned before, preliminary studies
attribute it to disorder at the semiconductor-superconductor interface [
100 ] , but also the emergence of quasiparticle states in the gap tends
to destroy topological protection, since quasiparticles occupying such
sub-gap states will inevitably participate affecting the quantum state
when braiding the MBSs and thus inducing decoherence effects [ 108 , 109
] . Their findings were partially in agreement with the existence of
such zero energy Majorana bound states [ 110 , 111 , 81 ] , and
subsequent theoretical explanations showed that these features, as the
non-closing of the gap, can be understood with realistic NS calculations
[ 70 , 112 , 71 , 52 ] .

New experiments have been also reported within the last year, where in
nanowires the soft-gap problem was recently resolved by growing Al
superconductor epitaxially on InAs nanowires (see Fig. 14 ), yielding
greatly reduced sub-gap conductance [ 113 , 114 , 115 ] and later it was
realised in a two dimensional semiconductor-superconductor
heterostructure [ 116 ] . Further studies on these materials showed
improved Majorana signatures [ 117 ] . The InAs nanowire still contain
residual disorder, which shows up as unintentional quantum dots in
transport measurements [ 103 , 49 , 113 ] .

Then, as an alternative material, the Delft group has recently reported
new experiments showing significant improvements in reducing disorder in
a high-quality interface between an InSb nanowire and NbTiN
superconductor [ 118 ] (see Fig. 15 ). They demonstrate ballistic
transport and induced hard-gap with strongly reduced subgap density of
states by gate tuning the device to a tunnel probe. In their experiment,
the induced zero-bias peak is consistent with theory and exclude other
explanations based on disorder effects. The choice for InSb nanowires is
fully justified. Indeed, in general, InSb nanowires are cleaner (showing
higher electron mobility [ 119 , 120 ] ) than InAs. Additionally InSb
has a larger @xmath -factor (about @xmath times larger), thus reducing
the required external magnetic field needed to induce the topological
phase transition.

According to previous discussion, recently there has been a remarkably
progress in fabrication of junctions with hard gaps and good
transparency in the single-channel limit. Therefore, it is natural to
ask what can we learn from these good junctions beyond the zero-bias
paradigm and investigate new geometries such as SNS junctions, which
offer a number of advantages over NS junctions. These issues are
investigated along this thesis.

The spin-texture needed for entering into the topological
superconducting phase and generated by the SOC and Zeeman fields in
previous description can be also mimicked by a chain of magnetic atoms
with an spatially modulated spin arrangement [ 63 , 65 , 43 , 64 , 121 ,
122 ] . Similar ideas allowed Nadj-Perge et al. [ 123 ] to investigate
an alternative scenario, where Fe atoms were placed on a conventional
@xmath -wave superconductor (Pb) with strong SOC. Here, the topological
superconducting phase arises from the ferromagnetic interaction between
Fe atoms and the strong SOC in the superconductor. Nadj-Perge et al. [
123 ] reported preliminary evidence of zero bias peaks in the density of
states, by Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), associated with the
ends of the magnetic chains as possible Majorana signatures. Still, it
has triggered interesting discussions on the physical origin of these
peaks due to the short values for the Majorana localization lengths.
Although there are some possible theoretical explanations [ 124 ] ,
additional investigations are needed for supporting their findings. More
recently, Pawlak et al. [ 125 ] investigated the spatial and electronic
characteristics of topological superconducting chains of iron atoms on
the surface of Pb(110) by combining STM and atomic force microscopy
(AFM). They demonstrated that the Fe chains are mono-atomic and exhibit
zero-bias conductance peaks at their ends, which are interpreted as
signature for the Majorana bound state. It is also shown another strong
fingerprint associated with the localization of the Majorana
wavefunction, which exhibits an exponential decay. In this experiment
the proximity gap is driven into the topological phase by a spin texture
which gives rise to a helical field in a similar fashion as in [ 123 ] .

### 7 This thesis

As discussed in previous sections, there has been an increasing
theoretical and experimental interest towards real signatures for
engineering one-dimensional topological superconductivity and therefore
Majorana bound states. In spite of the efforts, conclusive experiments
are urgently needed, and further theoretical analysis has to be done in
more complex geometries such as Superconductor-Normal
metal-Superconductor (SNS) junctions [ 126 , 127 ] . This geometry has a
number of advantages including the possibility of studying supercurrents
[ 128 , 78 , 98 , 99 , 129 ] , or direct spectroscopy of Andreev bound
states (ABS) [ 130 , 131 , 132 , 133 , 134 , 135 , 136 , 49 , 137 ] . As
we shall discuss along this thesis, this latter technique can be used,
in principle, to directly monitor the detailed evolution from the
trivial to the topological phase. Moreover, it contains information
about the peculiar dependence of Majorana bound states hybridization
with superconductor phase difference, despite not requiring any external
control on it. In the following we describe our main findings.

#### Chapter 2

In this chapter we provide an introduction to the technical part of this
thesis. Indeed, an important part of this thesis was devoted to
investigate an appropriate scheme for modelling hybrid junctions. For a
complete description, we firstly introduce the classification of SNS
junctions based on the comparison between the length of the normal N
region, @xmath , and the superconducting coherence length, @xmath :
short junctions for @xmath , and long for @xmath . Then, we show in a
simple example how the concepts of Andreev reflection, Andreev bound
states and Multiple Andreev reflections emerge. Later, we concentrate on
giving the necessary details for modelling superconducting nanowires and
hybrid one-dimensional NS and SNS junctions made of nanowires with
Rashba SOC and Zeeman interaction. Afterwards, we make a detailed
calculation of Andreev bound states and Josephson currents in SNS
junctions made of Rashba nanowires with Zeeman interactions and induced
@xmath -wave superconductivity. Here, we show the detailed evolution of
the Andreev bound states from the trivial phase into the topological
phase with Majorana bound states. Moreover, we show that the Josephson
and the critical current exhibit non-trivial signatures when Majorana
bound states are present, which should be experimentally accessible with
the outstanding advance in fabrication techniques.

#### Chapter 3

Motivated by the experiments based on nanowires hybrid junctions coupled
to superconductors, we focused on the study of transport in voltage
biased short SNS Josephson junctions made of NWs with strong spin-orbit
coupling, as the system undergoes into the topological superconducting
phase for increasing the Zeeman field [ 138 ] . In this work, by means
of the Keldysh Green’s function technique, we proposed the multiple
Andreev reflection (MAR) and critical currents as an alternative and
powerful tool to study the topological transition. This is possible by
the direct effect that gap inversion, MBS formation and fermion-parity
conservation have on the MAR current at various junction transparencies.
On the other hand, we also showed that the critical current remains
unexpectedly finite for all Zeeman fields due to a significant continuum
contribution, and exhibits an anomaly at the topological transition that
could be experimentally traced.

#### Chapter 4

To support new experiments and provide further insights towards the
origin of Majorana-like physics in hybrid
superconductor-semiconductor-superconductor junctions, we made a
detailed study on the role that confinement and helicity have on normal
transport and on the sub-gap Andreev spectrum in short and long SNS
junctions made of semiconducting nanowires (NWs) with strong Rashba
spin-orbit coupling [ 139 ] . We identified different normal transport
regimes that lead to very interesting physics when superconducting leads
are attached. Indeed, we found that a long junction with a helical
normal section, but still in the topologically trivial regime, supports
a low-energy sub-gap spectrum consisting of multiple-loop structures and
parity crossings that smoothly evolve towards Majorana bound states as
the Zeeman field exceeds its critical value. This suggests an
interesting connection between sub-gap parity crossings in helical
junctions in the trivial phase and Majorana bound states in the
topological one.

#### Chapter 5

Motivated and ispired by our previous work, where we found a connection
between sub-gap parity crossings in helical junctions, in the trivial
phase, and Majorana bound states, in the topological phase, we have
investigated a novel approach to engineer Majorana bound states in
non-topological superconducting wires [ 140 ] . The recipe of our scheme
consists that instead of inducing a topological transition in a
proximized Rashba NW, we propose to create a sufficiently transparent
normal-superconductor junction on a Rashba wire, with a topologically
trivial superconducting side and a helical normal side. The strong
coupling to the half-metallic environment forces a single long-lived
resonance to emerge at precisely zero energy above a threshold
transparency, which evolves as the transparency is increased further
into a stable state localised at the junction. The robust zero energy
pinning is protected by electron-hole symmetry, and it is not the result
of any fine tuning, due to eigenstate bifurcation of the scattering
matrix poles at exceptional points. We show that relevant transport and
spectral properties associated to these zero energy states, here dubbed
exceptional point Majorana bound states, are indistinguishable from
those of conventional Majorana bound states.

#### Chapter 6

In this Chapter we analyse screening properties in superconducting
one-dimensional nanowires with SOC and with Zeeman interaction. Our
study is based on the linear response theory using the Bogoliubov De
Gennes formulation of excitations in a superconductor and on the Randon
Phase Approximation (RPA) approach. Firstly, we calculate the
density-density response function and then we apply it to obtain the RPA
dielectric function and the screening properties of these wires. This
calculation is relevant for experiments trying to measure Majorana bound
states and their non-trivial overlap (which might change depending on
the screening potential inside the wire).

## Chapter \thechapter SNS junctions made of nanowires with spin-orbit
coupling999The results of this chapter are being prepared for
publication.

In this chapter, we formally introduce hybrid Normal
metal-Superconductor (NS) and Superconductor-Normal metal-Superconductor
(SNS) junctions. For a better understanding, we firstly describe a
situation where the spin-orbit coupling and the Zeeman interactions are
neglected. Here, we discuss the basic phenomena in these systems such as
Andreev reflection (AR), Andreev bound states (ABSs) and Multiple
Andreev reflections (MARs) based mainly on scattering arguments, and
then we classify SNS junctions depending on the length of the normal
region with respect to the superconducting coherence length.

Later, we provide a full tight-binding description for modelling
superconducting nanowires, NS and SNS junctions made of one-dimensional
semiconducting nanowires with SOC in presence of Zeeman interaction,
where superconducting correlations are induced via proximity effect.
Afterwards, we investigate the ABSs formation and the emergence of
Majorana bound states in short and long SNS junctions, as well as in
superconducting nanowires and NS junctions. In this part, we present the
Andreev bound states as function of the superconducting phase difference
for different values of the Zeeman field, spanning the trivial and
topological phases. Then, we concentrate on the Josephson current
dependence on the superconducting phase difference, calculated from the
Adreev spectrum in short and long SNS junctions. We show that the
presence of MBSs in the topological phase is a distinguishable signature
in both the Andreev spectrum and the Josephson current despite of being
@xmath periodic. We also present the critical current as a function of
the Zeeman field, which allows to make a detailed study of the
topological transition and trace the behaviour of the topological gap,
which after the band inversion gives rise to the topological phase with
MBSs. We report that the topological transition point is a robust
feature, which we expect to be distinguishable from other mechanisms in
real experiments.

### 8 Introduction

All physical proposals for investigating the emergence of Majorana bound
states (MBSs) include @xmath -wave superconductors. In the previous
chapter, we have introduced the platform based on nanowires with strong
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) placed on a trivial @xmath -wave
superconductor. Assuming good contact between the superconductor and the
nanowire, superconducting correlations are then induced into the
nanowire via proximity effect, giving rise to a superconducting
nanowire. Then, by applying an external Zeeman field, @xmath , the
system reaches the topological phase for @xmath with Majorana bound
states (MBSs) at the end of the wire, one at each end. Here, @xmath is
the chemical potential of the wire and @xmath the induced
superconducting @xmath -wave pairing.

Performing measurements on single superconducting nanowires is a
challenging task and instead it is usually required to fabricate
junctions between normal and superconducting systems. This allows to
tune different system parameters in the different regions of the system
and therefore perform, for instance, transport measurements. These
systems are known as hybrid, since they combine the effects of regions
in the superconducting state with others in the normal state. For
instance, a nanowire can be partially placed on a superconductor. Then,
due to the proximity effect, the region in contact with the
superconductor acquires superconductivity (denoted by S) leaving the
other region (the non-proximitized region) in the normal state (denoted
by N). This results in a NS junction. Additionally, one can place
another superconductor bellow the left part of the nanowire. In this
geometry, superconducting correlations are induced onto the regions that
are in contact with the superconductors and therefore leaving a central
region of the wire in the normal state. This system is refereed to as
SNS junction.

Important effects take place in these hybrid systems which lead to very
unusual physics and provide a powerful platform for investigating
topological superconductivity and therefore Majorana bound states. In
this chapter we first describe the basic phenomena in NS and SNS
structures and then we focus on the low-energy Adreev spectrum in NS and
SNS junctions made of semiconducting nanowires with Rashba SOC and
Zeeman interaction. Additionally, we study phase-biased transport in SNS
junctions and suggest it as a useful tool for the search of MBSs in
nanowires.

### 9 Basic phenomena in NS and SNS junctions

In this section, we introduce two important effects which take place in
NS and SNS junctions: the Andreev reflection in NS junction and the
formation of Andreev bound states (ABSs) and multiple Andreev
reflections (MAR) in SNS junctions.

#### 9.1 NS junctions: Andreev reflection

Semiconducting nanowire junctions represent a very important platform
for investigating scattering processes. Consider, for instance, a
junction formed out by two regions, where a right moving electron hits
the interface between them. At this point, the electron experiments
reflection or transmission according to scattering theory and depend on
various properties of the system under investigation. Within the
reflection process, the electron is reflected as an electron, if the
right part of the system is a non-superconducting region. The situation,
however, changes when the right part is a superconductor.

Consider a NS junction, where neither SOC nor Zeeman effects are
involved and superconductivity is allowed only in the S part, as
sketched in Fig. 16 . In this case, the Fermi energy of the N side tends
to be aligned with the Fermi energy of the S region. Now, suppose an
electron is created in the normal region N with energy @xmath , and
travels towards the NS interface. When such incident electron meets the
NS interface it can be reflected or transmitted according to the
scattering point of view. The analysis of this scattering problem is
carried out by solving the BdG equations, given by Eq. ( 16 ), in the
two regions. For determining the wave-functions and the energy spectrum,
one follows the wave-matching technique taking into account the relation
between the energy of the incident electron and the superconducting
energy gap @xmath . Indeed, when the energy of the incident electron is
less than the superconducting gap, @xmath , there are no states in the S
part available for transmission, and therefore the only possibility for
the incident electron is to be fully reflected as a hole when there is
no potential barrier at the interface. See Fig. 16 . This reflection
process is known as Andreev reflection (AR) [ 141 ] . Because the
charges of an electron and a hole are opposite, a charge of @xmath , a
Cooper pair, is transferred from the normal metal into the
superconductor. Following wave-matching techniques, the Andreev
reflection amplitude of an incoming electron and an outgoing hole can be
written as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (65)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the superconducting phase. For the calculation of @xmath
it is also assumed Andreev approximation, meaning that @xmath , where
@xmath is the chemical potential. Following similar ideas and under
similar physical conditions, an incident hole with energy @xmath from
the N region is reflected as an electron with amplitude @xmath . The
Andreev reflection amplitude for a left going electron into a right
going hole is @xmath , while for a left going hole and a right going
electron @xmath . Notice that during this special reflection process the
reflected quasiparticle acquires a phase from the superconductor, which
leads to very interesting physics when a left superconducting contact is
additionally attached to the NS junction (see next).

#### 9.2 SNS junctions: Andreev bound states

Let us now attach another superconductor on the left side of our
previous NS junction. This gives rise to the so-called SNS junction. Our
system is now composed of a left superconductor (S) with pairing
potential @xmath , a central normal system (N) of length @xmath with
zero superconducting pairing and a right superconductor (S) with @xmath
, as depicted in Fig. 17 . Notice that we focus on ballistic or
perfectly transmitted SNS junctions. A brief discussion of finite
transmission junction will be given at the end of this section. Consider
again a right-moving electron at low energy @xmath . According to the
Andreev reflection process described in the previous section, such
electron is reflected at the right NS interface into a left moving-hole,
leaving a charge of @xmath in the right superconductor. Then, the
left-moving hole meets the left SN interface and is reflected back into
a right-moving electron, taking a charge of @xmath from the left
superconductor. During one of these cycles a Cooper pair of charge
@xmath is transferred from the left to the right superconductor, thus
creating a supercurrent flow across the junction, as it is schematically
shown in Fig. 17 .

Because of the finite length of region N, @xmath , discrete energy
levels are formed. When the phase difference, @xmath , is non-zero, the
SNS structure host standing bound waves with quantised energies. The
corresponding states are referred to as Andreev bound states (ABSs) [
142 ] . In general, the condition for the formation of bound states in
one-dimension dictates that the total phase acquired during one cycle is
a multiple of @xmath [ 58 ] ,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (66)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath , @xmath , and the signs @xmath in front of @xmath
corresponds to a process starting with a right-moving electron (and its
left-moving Andreev reflected hole), and to a process starting with a
left-moving electron (and its right-moving Andreev reflected hole),
respectively. Eq. ( 66 ) can be explicitly solved in two special limits:
@xmath and @xmath . Within the Andreev approximation @xmath , one can
approximate @xmath , where @xmath . Moreover, we consider states within
the superconducting energy gap, @xmath . Then, the two special limits
give rise to the classification of such SNS junctions, which is based
according to the relation between the length of the normal region @xmath
and the superconducting coherence length @xmath [ 143 ] ¹¹ ¹¹ 11 We
point out that the superconducting coherence length @xmath can be also
defined without the factor @xmath in the denominator: @xmath . ,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (67)
  -- -------- -- ------

Such classification can be also given in terms of natural energy scales
of the problem, the Thouless energy, @xmath , and the induced
superconducting pairing potential @xmath , being @xmath the Fermi
velocity, and @xmath the length of the normal region. The above
conditions, in terms of these energy scales, are

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (68)
  -- -------- -- ------

Therefore, for a short junction the third term in Eq. ( 66 ) is
neglected and we get two degenerated Andreev bound states

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (69)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath . The special case of @xmath , corresponds to the so-called
weak link junctions , where the only need for having ABSs is finite
superconducting phase difference. This limit corresponds to the
so-called superconducting point contact . For the long-junction regime,
considering @xmath and therefore setting @xmath , we have

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (70)
  -- -------- -- ------

Notice that here we have a set of equally spaced energy levels until the
levels approach @xmath , and the position of the levels is set by the
superconducting phase difference @xmath .

In Fig. 18 we present the ABSs for short ( @xmath ) and long ( @xmath )
SNS junctions given by Eqs. ( 69 ) and  ( 70 ), respectively.

Notice that in the previous analysis we have considered ballistic SNS
junctions, where elastic scattering is negligible. When the normal
region N has a finite transmission @xmath , there exists a finite
backscattering probability in the normal region. Hence, in the case of a
single channel short junction ( @xmath ), a right-moving electron (or
hole) can be reflected back into a left-moving electron (or hole),
therefore giving rise to a coupling between the two ballistic ABSs,
which have energies smaller than the superconducting gap @xmath and are
localised at the short junction over a distance of the order of @xmath [
142 , 144 ] ,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (71)
  -- -------- -- ------

The dependence of the energy levels on the superconducting phase
difference @xmath , from previous expression, is plotted in Fig. 19 for
different transmission values @xmath . In the ballistic regime ( @xmath
), two levels, corresponding to left-moving ( @xmath ) and right-moving
( @xmath ) electrons, cross at @xmath , while @xmath gives rise to an
anticrossing at @xmath of size @xmath . Decreasing @xmath , the opened
gap increases and for sufficiently small transmission the ABSs lie at
@xmath . The transmission @xmath can be tuned electrostatically with
gates for instance.

#### 9.3 The Josephson current

As a result of the formation of Andreev bound states in SNS junctions a
pair of correlated electrons is transferred from the left to the right
superconductor, creating a supercurrent flow across the junction. This
phenomenon is known as the dc-Josephson effect and takes place as long
as the superconducting phase difference is finite [ 145 ] . An important
characteristic among the expressions given by Eqs. ( 69 ),  ( 70 ) and
 ( 71 ) is the energy levels dependence on the superconducting phase
difference between the two superconductors. This constitute the base of
the Josephson effect [ 145 ] , which states that a finite current flows
between the two superconductors when the superconducting phase
difference is finite. In fact, the discovery of the Josephson effect was
done in Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor (SIS) tunneling
junctions, where Cooper pairs coherently tunnel through the insulating
barrier between the superconductors and lead to a supercurrent flow
which exhibits a dependence on the superconducting phase difference
@xmath , being the critical current @xmath the maximum supercurrent that
the junction can support [ 145 ] .

The Josephson current can be calculated from the thermodynamic
potential, @xmath , as a function of the superconducting phase
difference between the two superconductors, @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (72)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath thermodynamic potential (the grand canonical for instance)
of the superconductor [ 58 , 144 ] . The factor of @xmath in previous
equation accounts for the Cooper pair charge and all the degeneracies
are included in @xmath . Important to notice here is that previous
formula is a general expression and remains valid for any kind of
Josephson junction [ 58 ] . In order to find the current, one should be
able to calculate @xmath . It can be done following the Green’s function
technique [ 146 ] or directly from the BdG equations given by Eq. ( 16 )
[ 58 , 144 ] . The latter approach leads to [ 58 , 144 ]

  -- -- -- ------
           (73)
  -- -- -- ------

where the first term represents the contributions from the discrete
positive Andreev levels within the gap and the second term contains the
contribution from the excited states in the continuum with energies
above @xmath , whose density of states is @xmath . Notice that in
previous expression we have considered that our system is not spin
degenerate, otherwise we would have obtained a factor of 2 multiplying
the two terms on the right side.

In the short-junction limit ( @xmath ), @xmath is the same as in a bulk
superconductor and therefore is phase independent. Hence, in this
regime, the energy levels from the continuous spectrum do not contribute
to the Josephson current @xmath and Eq. ( 73 ) at zero temperature,
@xmath , reduces to

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (74)
  -- -------- -- ------

For a short junction ( @xmath ) we have obtained in Eqs. ( 71 ) two
degenerate ABSs which are spin degenerate. Applying the previous
approach for finding the Josephson current carried by the two ABSs,
@xmath (the factor of @xmath here counts for spin degeneracy). Then,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (75)
  -- -------- -- ------

where each ABS carry supercurrent in opposite direction, which is
plotted in Fig. 20 . Notice that the supercurrent or Josephson current
is an odd periodic function of @xmath with period @xmath and is zero at
@xmath for @xmath . The current-phase characteristics strongly depends
on the transmission @xmath . For @xmath , the junction is in the tunnel
regime and the current follows @xmath , where @xmath is the critical
current, which is the maximum supercurrent at @xmath . On the other
hand, for @xmath , one has @xmath , where @xmath is the critical
current, which is the maximum supercurrent at @xmath .

Notice that, in general, in a short junction with @xmath channels the
number of ABSs within the gap is @xmath , where due to electron-hole
symmetry of the Nambu description @xmath are positive and @xmath
negative.

In general, long junctions ( @xmath ) host many energy levels within the
gap @xmath (see Fig. 18 ), unlike the short-junction case. We have shown
that for @xmath the energy levels are given by Eq. ( 70 ). For
calculating the Josephson current, however, the levels above the gap may
also contribute to the current as it is given by Eq. ( 73 ). Thus, we
cannot just perform the derivative of the energy levels found in Eq. (
70 ) with respect to @xmath , and then use Eq. ( 74 ). We do not
calculate the supercurrent in long junctions but rather discuss some
differences with short junctions. It was shown that the Josephson
current in a long junction at zero temperature is a @xmath periodic
function in the phase difference @xmath and it has a linear relation
with the phase gradient @xmath within @xmath , being zero at @xmath and
exhibiting a sawtooth profile at odd multiples of @xmath [ 147 , 148 ] .

Along this thesis, however, we will not only use the approach presented
in this part for calculating the Josephson current, but we also employ
the Green’s function formalism. The latter is described in Chapter
Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful
platforms to study Majorana bound states .

##### 9.3.1 Multiple Andreev reflections (MAR)

We have seen that in a SNS junction a right-moving electron is Andreev
reflected as a hole at the right NS interface into a left-moving hole,
which is also Andreev reflected into a right-moving hole at the left SN
interface. Thus, Andreev reflections favour the formation of Andreev
bound states. When a constant voltage @xmath is applied across the
junction, the situation changes drastically. First, the superconducting
phase difference becomes time-dependent and increases linearly with time
@xmath . The Josephson current becomes oscillatory with @xmath , giving
rise to the ac Josephson effect [ 145 ] . We assume that the voltage
drops over an arbitrary point of the N region, denoted by the orange
dashed line in Fig. 21 A right-moving electron (hole) increases
(decreases) its energy each time it crosses the normal region N from
left to right, while the Andreev reflected hole (electron) increases its
energy passing through N from right to left.

Since energies are changing in the process of transmission,
quasiparticle energies of both signs are considered and in left and
right superconducting electrodes only quasiparticle states with @xmath
are available (Fig. 21 ). A right-moving electron from the left
superconductor with energy below @xmath crosses the N region and arrives
at the right superconductor only if @xmath (top panel Fig. 21 ). This
represents a single quasiparticle process, where a charge of @xmath is
transferred from the left to the right superconductor. For @xmath
slightly greater than @xmath , the right-moving electron arrives at the
NS interface and performs an Andreev reflection, since it is the unique
possibility as within @xmath there are no available quasiparticle
states. As a result, a left-moving hole emerges and when crossing the N
region, it increases its energy by @xmath arriving at the continuum of
the left superconductor. During this process a charge of @xmath is
transferred from the left to the right superconductor. For @xmath , the
right-moving electron from the left superconductor performs multiple
Andreev reflections (MAR) as needed to exit the superconducting gap. In
each process, a charge of @xmath is transferred, at least. The @xmath
processes involves @xmath Andreev reflections, and starts with threshold
voltages @xmath . Important to remark is that a new transport channel
arises whenever the full gap si an odd integer multiple of @xmath :
@xmath , otherwise the right-moving electron ends up at the continuum of
states of the left superconductor (second panel in Fig. 21 ). These
processes give rise to a number of singularities in the I-V curves at
the corresponding voltage.

### 10 NS and SNS junctions made of Rashba nanowires: Details on
modelling

In Chap. Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as
useful platforms to study Majorana bound states we have discussed the
emergence of Majorana bound states (MBSs) in the Kitaev’s toy model and
then in a physical system based on Rashba nanowires. We have pointed out
that MBSs emerge at interfaces of systems with different topology.
Within the Rashba nanowire proposal what one needs is a nanowire with
Rashba SOC placed on a @xmath -wave superconductor and then apply a
Zeeman field @xmath , perpendicular to the SO axis. The system exhibits
two topologically different phases, which can be driven by varying
@xmath . The topological transition is defined by the critical field
@xmath , where @xmath is the chemical potential of the superconducting
wire and @xmath the induced pairing potential. For high fields, @xmath ,
the superconducting nanowire is in the topological phase with Majorana
bound states at its ends, one at each end. Here, the interfaces between
two topologically different regions are between the topological
superconducting nanowire and vacuum, which is in the trivial
non-topological phase. We have also discussed that the wave-functions of
the two Majorana bound states decay exponentially into the bulk of the
superconducting wire [ 76 , 77 ] . The relevant decay length
characterising this overlap is the Majorana localisation length @xmath ,
which tells us how well are MBSs localised at the ends of the wire. For
finite @xmath , being @xmath the length of the superconducting wire, the
overlap between MBSs is significant and therefore they are no longer
true zero modes. If there is a finite overlap between the MBSs wave
functions, then the energy of the MBSs splits leaving behind their zero
energy character. However, for long enough wires, they can still be
considered as zero modes.

Junctions made of nanowires also represent experimental feasible
platforms for the search of MBSs. Placing only the right region of a
nanowire on a @xmath -wave superconductor gives rise to NS junctions,
while placing a nanowire on top of two @xmath -wave superconductors, as
making a bridge, lead to SNS junctions. In this section we describe how
to model superconducting nanowires, NS and SNS junctions based on the
semiconducting nanowires with SOC. Then, we perform a full analysis of
the low-energy Andreev spectrum in such junctions and finally we focus
on supercurrents and critical currents.

The calculations presented in this part are carried out considering
experimental values for InSb nanowires: the electron’s effective mass
@xmath , the spin-orbit strength @xmath meVnm and typical induced
pairing gap of @xmath meV [ 67 ] . The other parameters such as the
chemical potential is considered arbitrary since in principle it can be
controlled by means of electric gates.

#### 10.1 Tight-Binding discretization

For computation purposes, we consider a discretisation of the 1D
continuum model given by Eq. ( 41 ) for the Rashba nanowire into a
tight-binding (TB) lattice with a small lattice spacing @xmath , see
Fig. 22 . The smaller is @xmath , the better is the description and by
letting such lattice constant tend to zero one recovers the usual
continuum limit. We choose a discrete lattice whose points are located
at @xmath , where @xmath is an integer and @xmath the small lattice
spacing. Notice that by doing so, we are trying to find a matrix
representation of the 1D continuum model in site space. Within the TB
approach, Eq. ( 41 ) reads

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (76)
  -- -------- -- ------

where the symbol @xmath means that @xmath couples nearest-neighbor
@xmath sites and

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (77)
  -- -------- -- ------

are matrices in spin space, @xmath is the hopping parameter and @xmath
the SO hopping. The dimension of the matrix @xmath is set by the number
of sites of the wire.

In the following subsections we describe how one can model
superconducting wires, NS and SNS junctions based on the tight-binding
description presented here.

#### 10.2 The superconducting wire model

Consider a semiconducting nanowire placed on top of a superconductor,
similar to the original proposal discussed in Sec. 5 of Chap. Hybrid
superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful platforms to
study Majorana bound states . Assuming good contact between the nanowire
and the superconductor, superconducting correlations are induced into
the nanowire via proximity effect, resulting in a superconducting wire.
This is schematically shown in Fig. 23 .

The nanowire is single mode and modelled with the Hamiltonian given by
Eq. ( 41 ), which is discretised into a tight-binding lattice resulting
in the Hamiltonian given by Eq. ( 76 ). The length of the
superconducting wire is @xmath , where @xmath is the number of sites and
@xmath the lattice spacing. Superconducting correlations are of @xmath
-wave type as described in Sec. 5 of Chap. Hybrid
superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful platforms to
study Majorana bound states and the pairing potential is given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (78)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the superconducting phase and @xmath the @xmath Pauli
matrix. The full Hamiltonian describing the superconductivity nanowire
is written in Nambu space

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (79)
  -- -------- -- ------

Previous Hamiltonian is diagonalised numerically and exactly solved with
the dimensions given by the number of sites of the wire, which implies a
dependence on the length of the wire. Previous description accounts for
finite length wires and therefore it is important upon investigating the
overlap of MBSs discussed in in Sec. 5 of Chap. Hybrid
superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful platforms to
study Majorana bound states . The superconducting phase in the order
parameter is assumed to be zero in our calculations of this part as it
is only relevant when investigating Andreev bound states (see next
sections).

Based on the Hamiltonian model given by Eq. ( 79 ), we first analyse
what happens to the low-energy spectrum as a function of the wire’s
length @xmath . This is shown in Figs. 24 and 25 . Top row in Fig. 24
shows the energy spectrum of a normal nanowire at zero Zeeman field for
zero and finite superconducting pairing, respectively. While in the
normal state (top left panel) the energy spectrum is gapless, by
inducing superconductivity with a finite @xmath (top right panel), a
clear gap is opened in the energy spectrum, as expected, and remains
finite as the length of the wire is increased. This is in accordance
with the Anderson’s theorem which prevents the existence of bound states
inside the gap of an s-wave superconductor for non-magnetic impurities [
60 ] . For a finite Zeeman field (bottom row), but still in the trivial
phase (left bottom panel), the induced gap, opened by superconductivity,
gets reduced as expected according to the description given in Sec. 5 .
While in the trivial phase, @xmath , there are no levels within the
induced gap (bottom left panel), in the topological phase, @xmath , two
energy levels from energies around @xmath develop an oscillatory
decaying behaviour as the length of the wire, @xmath , is increased. As
such length is made really long, the amplitude of the oscillations is
reduced and even totally negligible, where the levels become zero energy
(see green dashed line). These lowest energy levels represent the
oscillating MBSs, which for long wires become zero energy. This
discussion is in accordance with description made in Sec. 5 . Indeed,
the low momentum gap gets reduced as @xmath increases and closes at
@xmath marking the topological phase transition point and for @xmath the
system is in the topological superconducting phase with MBSs.

Before going further, in Fig. 25 we demonstrate the importance of the
SOC towards the emergence of MBSs in nanowires. We examine the energy
spectrum of a Rashba nanowire for @xmath at zero and at finite SOC (left
and right panels in Fig. 25 ). While at zero SOC, left panel, the
spectrum consists of a dense quasi-continuum as the length @xmath
increases, a finite SOC removes all finite energy crossings while
preserving the lowest two oscillatory decaying levels coming from
energies around @xmath . The oscillatory pattern is visible for @xmath ,
while for long enough wires @xmath the oscillations are considerable
reduced and assumed to be zero, as marked by magenta and green dashed
lines. Notice that @xmath represents the Majorana localisation length.
We therefore conclude that, as expected for @xmath , a topological
superconducting nanowire host two MBSs (one at each end of the wire)
which exhibit an energy splitting when their overlap is finite, while
for long enough wires they become zero energy.

In order to clarify the previous discussion, we show in Fig. 26 the
low-energy spectrum as a function of the Zeeman field at fixed wire’s
length (see caption for more details). Top left panel represents the
case of zero superconducting pairing, @xmath , and finite SOC, @xmath ,
while top right panel a situation of finite pairing, @xmath , but with
zero SOC, @xmath . Bottom panels show a calculation for finite both SOC
and superconducting pairing for @xmath and @xmath , respectively. In
Fig. 24 (top left panel) we have seen that at @xmath and @xmath the
energy spectrum consists of a dense quasi-continuum. The same is
observed in Fig. 26 (top left panel). Notice that as the Zeeman field
takes finite values and increases, the energy levels split as shown in
top left panel for @xmath and @xmath . As the Zeeman field increases,
within the weak Zeeman phase @xmath , the energy levels contain both
spin components and for certain values of the Zeeman field they may
cross zero energy, while in the strong Zeeman phase @xmath one spin
sector is completely removed giving rise to a spin-polarised spectrum as
one can indeed observe in top left panel of Fig. 26 . The transition
point from weak to strong Zeeman phases is marked by the chemical
potential @xmath (green dashed line), while the spin-orbit energy is
marked by the orange dashed line. We point out that none of the zero
energy crossings are protected in top left panel of Fig. 26 .

Top right panel of Fig. 26 shows the energy levels at finite
superconducting pairing, @xmath , and zero SOC, @xmath . The first thing
one notices, in comparison to the top left panel of Fig. 26 , is that at
zero Zeeman field the superconducting pairing induces a gap with no
levels within it according to the Anderson theorem as discussed before [
60 ] . The magnetic field applied to a finite length superconducting
nanowire tends to destroy the pairing of the electrons, inducing the
so-called Zeeman depairing. Here, the spins of the electrons couple with
the field, the up and down levels shift by @xmath , and roughly
speaking, when @xmath exceeds the induced superconducting gap @xmath the
superconductivity ceases. This is indeed observed in top right panel of
Fig. 26 . As the Zeeman increases, the energy levels from energies
around @xmath get coupled to the Zeeman field and reduce their energies,
thus reducing the induced gap. Different spin components of the energy
levels cross zero energy at @xmath , signalling the closing of the
induced superconducting gap, marked by the magenta dashed line. Further
increasing of the Zeeman field @xmath gives rise to a region (between
red and magenta dashed lines) where the energy levels contain both spin
components, which depend on the finite value of the chemical potential.
Indeed, we have checked that for @xmath magenta and red dashed lines
coincide (not shown). On the other hand, for @xmath , one spin sector is
removed and the energy levels are spin polarised, showing a family of
Zeeman crossings, which are not protected.

Remarkably, when the SOC is switched on we observe a number of changes
in the low-energy spectrum (bottom panels). First, the gap closing
changes from @xmath , shown in top right panel for zero SOC, to @xmath
(bottom panels). The critical field @xmath is the field which marks the
topological transition point into the topological superconducting phase
with MBSs. Second, a clear closing at @xmath and reopening for @xmath of
the induced gap is observed as the Zeeman field increases. Third, the
spin polarised energy spectrum shown in top right panel at zero SOC for
@xmath is washed out, keeping only the crossings around zero energy of
the two lowest levels. The two lowest energy levels for @xmath are the
celebrated MBSs, which in this case exhibit the expected oscillatory
behaviour due to their finite spatial overlap. For long enough wires,
the amplitude of the oscillations is considerable reduced (even
negligible) thus these levels acquire zero energy (see next discussion
for Fig. 27 ). Fourth, the SOC introduces a finite energy separation (
minigap ) between the lowest levels, crossings around zero, and the rest
of the levels. The value of this minigap is related to the outer gap we
have discussed in Sec. 5 , where we pointed out that such minigap is
roughly constant for strong SOC.

In order to support the view on the lowest levels for @xmath and have a
deeper insight about the topological transition, in Fig. 27 we present
the energy levels of a superconducting nanowire as function of the
Zeeman field for @xmath and @xmath . In both panels, the low-energy
levels react to the increasing of the Zeeman field and trace the gap
closing at @xmath , as discussed previously. By further increasing of
the Zeeman field, @xmath , two energy levels remain around zero energy
separated from the rest of the spectrum by a minigap, which is strongly
dependent on the SOC. The energy levels around zero oscillate when the
Zeeman field @xmath increases giving rise to an energy splitting between
them, as predicted by Eq. ( 64 ), [ 76 ] . The energy splitting can be
small for long enough wires, see right panel in Figs. 27 and 25 , though
strictly speaking it is non-zero for any length [ 75 , 70 , 71 , 76 ] .
The MBSs become merely quasi-stationary states, with their energy
splitting representing a Rabi frequency at which one oscillates into the
other. It is also important to mention here that above @xmath there is a
considerable amount of discrete levels which become visible when the
length of the wire is increased as observed in Fig. 27 . This is due to
the fact that since we are in a finite length nanowire the energy
spectrum is discrete, where part of it is within the gap and the other
above the gap forming the quasi-continuum. The discrete quasi-continuum
will have important consequences in the calculation of the Josephson
current across SNS junctions (see Sec. 11 ).

Thus, to conclude, we strongly point out that this part proves that only
the combination of SOC, @xmath -wave superconductivity and Zeeman
interaction gives rise to MBSs at the end of the wire for @xmath in
accordance with the original proposals [ 41 , 61 ] .

#### 10.3 The NS junction model

Now, we consider a nanowire with Rashba SOC partially placed on top of a
@xmath -wave superconductor as schematically shown in Fig. 28 . The
right part of the nanowire acquire superconducting correlations ( @xmath
) and the left region remains in the normal state (N). This results in a
NS junction.

Notice that an external magnetic field @xmath is applied along the wire
and perpendicular to the SO axis, which opens a gap of @xmath in the
energy spectrum, where @xmath is the associated Zeeman field in the
wire, @xmath is the wire’s @xmath -factor and @xmath the Bohr magneton.

For modelling the NS structure, we consider that the regions N and S are
described by the tight-binding Hamiltonian @xmath given by Eq. ( 76 ),
with their respective chemical potential, Zeeman field, hopping
parameters,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (80)
  -- -------- -- ------

where N and S denotes the normal and superconducting regions of the
junction. We will assume that only the chemical potentials are different
in the N and S regions. Notice that the NS junction of length @xmath is
discretized into a tight-binding lattice with spacing @xmath following
Subsec. 10.1 . Here, @xmath and @xmath are the lengths of the N and S
regions, being @xmath and @xmath the number of sites of S and N,
respectively.

The junction NS without superconducting correlations is therefore
modelled by the Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (81)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath and @xmath is the Hamiltonian for the normal and
superconducting regions given by Eq. ( 76 ) and the Hamiltonian @xmath
couples the normal region to the superconducting part and contains
non-zero elements for adjacent sites that lie at the interfaces of
@xmath and @xmath . One can control the transmission in these NS
junctions by a hopping matrix @xmath , @xmath , which parametrises the
coupling between the sites that define the interfaces of the NS
junction. A tunnel junction can be modelled by considering @xmath ,
while a fully transparent junction with @xmath . We consider fully
transparent junctions unless otherwise stablished. The @xmath -wave
pairing potential must have the same structure as previous Hamiltonian.
Therefore,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (82)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath and @xmath are the pairing potentials in the normal and in
the superconducting regions, respectively. As for superconducting
nanowires, the superconducting phase is assumed to be zero in our
calculations for NS junctions.

Therefore, the full Hamiltonian describing the NS junction is given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (83)
  -- -------- -- ------

In NS junctions described here (see Fig. 28 ) the S region becomes
topological for @xmath and therefore Majorana bound states emerge at its
ends in a similar fashion as in the topological superconducting wire
with the sole difference that now the left part of the superconducting
wire is in its normal state. We will see that this N part plays an
important role as it introduces additional energy levels into the energy
spectrum and therefore reduces the minigap which separates the MBSs from
the rest of the levels in the topological phase.

In the discussion made for topological superconducting wires we have
observed that in the trivial phase there are no levels within the
induced gap when the length of the wire @xmath is increased (see bottom
panels in Fig. 24 ). We have also seen that the low-energy spectrum of
such superconducting wires in the topological phase develops decaying
energy levels with an oscillatory behaviour as the length of the wire is
increased. Here, the lowest two levels represent the Majorana bound
states of the wire which oscillate due to the finite spatial overlap
between their wavefunctions and they acquire zero energy when the length
of the wire is long enough @xmath , being @xmath is the Majorana
localization length.

Now, we focus on the role of the length of the normal region @xmath in
the low-energy spectrum of the NS junction. This is reported in Fig. 29
, where we present the energy levels as function of the length of the
superconducting region @xmath for a very short (left panel) and long
(right panel) N regions. In the former, two levels emerge from the gap
@xmath and exponentially decay developing an oscillatory behaviour that
is suppressed as the length of the superconducting region @xmath
increases. This case is very similar to the one shown in right panel of
Fig. 25 for the topological superconducting wire. The latter, however,
posses some differences. Indeed, when the length of the N region is
increased, the number of energy levels of the system increases and even
inside the gap one finds levels which coexist with the MBSs (see right
panel in Fig. 29 ). This has a very important consequence as such levels
affect the mini-gap by reducing it almost to a half of the one in case
of a very short N region. This apparent negative role of having long N
regions is not completely true. In fact, the additional levels from N
reduce the minigap but they also reduce the amplitude of the
oscillations developed by the MBSs around zero energy. Compare for
instance dashed magenta lines in both panels of Fig. 29 . Therefore, the
condition for having zero modes in NS junctions with long N region is
reached before than in NS junctions with short N junctions. This is a
very important conclusion and represents an advantage over NS junctions
with short N regions towards practical implementation of MBSs for
testing their braiding statistics.

In Figs. 30 , 31 and 32 , we explore the dependence of the energy levels
as function of the Zeeman field @xmath for very short, intermediate and
long N regions of the NS junctions, respectively. In each figure we
present two cases for (left panel) visible and (right panel) neglectible
oscillations of the MBSs around zero energy. One observes that, as
expected, the low energy spectrum traces the gap closing at @xmath and
its respective reopening for @xmath . We strongly point out that, at
least in principle, spectroscopy of energy levels could experimentally
test the emergence of MBSs in NS junctions. For very short N regions,
shown in Fig. 30 , the energy levels behave in a similar way as in the
superconducting nanowire discussed in previous subsection (Fig. 27 ).
The increase of @xmath , presented in Figs. 31 and 32 , introduces
additional levels (coming from N) into the low-energy spectrum inside
@xmath as can be indeed observed and tend to reduce the minigap for
@xmath . Another important feature to notice in this part is that
although the energy levels follow the closing of the gap, they also
develop a number of crossings around zero energy before the topological
transition. Remarkably, this behaviour is not related to the topological
phase but rather to a sign that the N region has reached its helical
phase @xmath . More about this discussion will be given in Chap. Hybrid
superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful platforms to
study Majorana bound states . Moreover, we point out here that the
oscillations around zero energy of the MBSs can be reduced by either
increasing @xmath or @xmath . The price to pay in the former is that by
doing so one introduces additional levels and therefore the minigap
separating the MBSs from the rest is also reduced, while the latter
represents the standard picture for reducing such oscillations.

#### 10.4 The SNS junction model

We consider a nanowire with Rashba SOC subjected to an external magnetic
field @xmath along the wire and perpendicular to the SO axis. The
applied magnetic field opens a gap of @xmath in the energy spectrum,
where @xmath is the associated Zeeman field in the wire, @xmath is the
wire’s @xmath -factor and @xmath the Bohr magneton. This nanowire is
placed on top of two @xmath -wave superconductors (S’ with pairing
potentials @xmath ) as it is schematically shown in Fig. 33 . We assume
that there is a good contact interface between the nanowire and the
superconductors (S’), so that superconducting correlations are induced
by proximity effect into the regions of the nanowire that are in contact
with the superconductors. This results in a nanowire containing left (
@xmath ) and right ( @xmath ) regions with superconducting properties
leaving the central region in the normal state (N), as shown in Fig. 33
. These nanowires with left and right superconducting regions (denoted
by S) and a central normal one (N) represent the hybrid
Superconductor-Nanowire-Superconductor (SNS) junctions discussed here,
as shown in Fig. 34 . It is common to consider that as a result of the
proximity effect, the @xmath parts have acquired an induced pairing
@xmath . Although rigorously speaking this assumption is incorrect, it
provides a good description of the proximity effect for large gaps
@xmath .

The superconducting regions of the nanowire are considered to have
chemical potential @xmath and superconducting pairing potential @xmath
and @xmath , where @xmath . The central region of the nanowire is in the
normal state without superconductivity, @xmath , and with chemical
potential @xmath .

For modelling SNS junctions made of Rashba nanowires, we proceed as in
previous subsections, where the system is discretised into a
tight-binding lattice with lattice spacing @xmath . Here, the SNS
junction is of length @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath , being @xmath
and @xmath are the number of sites in @xmath and @xmath , respectively.
The regions N and @xmath are described by the tight-binding Hamiltonian
@xmath given by Eq. ( 76 ), see Fig. 34 , with their respective chemical
potential, Zeeman field, hopping parameters,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (84)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath and @xmath denotes the normal and left(right)
superconducting regions of the SNS junction.

The Hamiltonian describing the SNS junction without superconductivity is
then given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (85)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the Hamiltonian of the superconducting region @xmath
that we consider to be the same, @xmath the Hamiltonian that couples the
superconducting region @xmath to the normal region @xmath , while @xmath
the Hamiltonian that couples the normal region to @xmath . The elements
of these coupling matrices are non-zero for adjacent sites that lie at
the interfaces of the superconducting regions and of the normal region,
only. This coupling is parametrized by a hopping matrix @xmath between
the sites that define the interfaces of the SNS junction, where @xmath .
A tunnel junction can be modelled by considering @xmath , while a full
transparent junction with @xmath . All the elements in the diagonal of
matrix Eq. ( 85 ) have the structure of @xmath given by Eq. ( 76 )
taking into account that the superconducting regions have a chemical
potential @xmath , while this is @xmath for the normal region. This was
stablished in Eq. ( 84 ). It is important to point out here that the
matrix of Eq. ( 85 ) is of finite size and the dimensions of the
matrices are set by the number of sites of the respective region. Now,
we are left with considering superconducting correlations. Again, @xmath
-wave pairing is taken into account and the pairing potential for the
full system must have the same structure as the SNS Hamiltonian, @xmath
. Therefore,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (86)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath since in the normal region the superconducting correlations
are absent, and @xmath . In the introduction of this Chapter we have
seen that a finite phase difference between @xmath and @xmath gives rise
to the physics of Andreev bound states and therefore to the Josephson
current. Thus, it is crucial to consider, and we indeed do, a finite
phase difference between @xmath and @xmath , @xmath : @xmath and @xmath
.

The full system Hamiltonian is then written in Nambu space

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (87)
  -- -------- -- ------

Previous Hamiltonian is diagonalised numerically and for our
calculations we consider realistic system parameters for InSb as
described in the introduction of this Chapter. In the next section we
properly investigate the low-energy spectrum and Josephson and critical
currents in SNS junctions, whose model was described in this part. In
particular, we focus on the formation of Andreev bound states, their
evolution into Majorana bound states and show that the presence of MBSs
can tested either by Andreev spectroscopy or by measuring the Josephson
and the critical currents.

### 11 Andreev levels and Josephson current in SNS junctions

As we have discussed in the introduction of this work, Sec. 4 , a
topological superconductor nanowire hosts two Majorana bound states
(MBSs) at its ends, @xmath and @xmath , one at each end. These two MBSs
define a non-local fermion and can be fused to form a Dirac fermion
@xmath . The fermion parity operator is defined as @xmath and has
eigenvalues @xmath or @xmath for empty @xmath and occupied @xmath
states. A spatial overlap of the two MBSs, in the superconducting wire,
hybridises them into eigenstates of opposite fermion parity. Indeed, in
a topological superconducting wire, the spatial overlap induces an
energy splitting given by Eq. ( 64 ) and it is proportional to @xmath [
76 ] .

On the other hand, in the case of a SNS junctions discussed here, the
superconducting regions of the nanowire, @xmath and @xmath , are driven
into the topological superconducting phase when @xmath , where @xmath .
Therefore, due to the finite length @xmath , we expect the formation of
four MBSs in the SNS junction: two at the interfaces with vacuum, @xmath
, ( outer MBSs ), and two at the interfaces with the normal regions of
the nanowire N, @xmath , ( inner MBSs ), as schematically shown in Fig.
35 . Notice that when @xmath , the outer MBSs are at infinity and the
problem involves only the two inner MBSs. The four MBSs hybridise both
through the region N or the finite region S. The two MBSs, @xmath , at
either side of the junction with phase difference @xmath and
transparency @xmath will hybridise into states of opposite fermion
parity with energies @xmath [ 87 , 66 ] , where @xmath is the effective
induced superconducting pairing. It is important to point out here that
a finite phase difference matters and the emergence of MBSs is not
arbitrary but the system hosts four MBSs when the phase difference is
@xmath , while for zero phase difference only the outer MBSs are
present, @xmath . The wave-functions of the MBSs decay exponentially
from both ends of the topological superconducting regions in the SNS
junction into the bulk of S. For finite @xmath , being @xmath the length
of the superconducting regions of the SNS junction and @xmath the
Majorana localisation length, the overlap between MBSs is significant
and therefore they are no longer true zero modes. However, if @xmath the
overlap is negligible and one can assume the MBSs to be true zero modes.

Thus, we conclude that in these SNS junctions of finite length four MBSs
emerge naturally. It was theoretically shown that the minimal platform
for investigating the non-Abelian statistics of MBSs consists of a
system with four MBSs [ 149 ] . Therefore, research along these lines
represents an important advance towards realistic implementations of
MBSs and potential application in topological quantum computation [ 24 ]
.

In this part we present the low-energy Andreev spectrum, Josephson
(supercurrent) and critical currents in ballistic short ( @xmath ) and
long ( @xmath ) SNS junctions based on the model described in previous
section, being @xmath the superconducting coherence length and @xmath
the length of the normal region. In particular, we discuss the formation
of Andreev bound states and their connection with the emergence of MBSs.
Finally, we propose the Josephson and critical currents as a powerful
tool for detecting MBSs in such hybrid systems.

#### 11.1 Andreev energy levels

In Figs. 36 and 37 , we show the Andreev levels as function of the
superconducting phase difference and their evolution with the Zeeman
field in a short SNS junction for @xmath and @xmath , respectively. On
the other hand, the dependence of the Andreev levels on the phase
difference for long junctions is presented in Figs. 38 and 39 .

Let us first concentrate on the short-junction regime, Figs. 36 and 34
for @xmath and @xmath , being @xmath the Majorana localisation length.
At zero magnetic field (top left panel in Figs. 36 and 34 ), two
degenerate ABSs appear within @xmath as solutions to the BdG equations.
Note that even this non-topological case is anomalous as the ABS
energies do not reach zero at @xmath , unlike predicted by the standard
theory for a transparent channel within the Andreev approximation @xmath
[ 144 ] . The dense amount of levels above @xmath represent the
quasi-continuum of states, which consists on a discrete set of levels
due to the finite length of the SNS junction. Indeed, all the
calculations presented here correspond to systems of finite length and
therefore their energy spectrum is discrete, where the levels in the
energy spectrum corresponds to the full system, the N and S regions.
Within the gap @xmath the junction host levels which are clearly
discrete, however, above @xmath one observes the formation of a discrete
quasi-continuum being denser for junctions with longer @xmath as
comparing Figs. 36 and 34 . This will have important consequences for
the calculation of the Josephson current (see next subsection).
Moreover, the detachment of the quasi-continuum at @xmath and @xmath is
not clear but what is clear is that it is not zero. In what follows we
will see that such detachment depends on the finite length of the S
regions (see Fig. 37 ).

For a non-zero Zeeman field the ABSs split and the two different gaps
@xmath and @xmath , discussed in Sec. 5 , emerge (top middle and right
panels). The former was defined at low momentum, while the latter at
higher momentum. By increasing the Zeeman field the low momentum gap
@xmath gets reduced as expected from the band structure for the
superconducting nanowire discussed in Sec. 5 , while the gap @xmath
remains roughly unchanged for strong SOC. At @xmath , the energy
spectrum exhibits the closing of the low momentum gap @xmath (bottom
left panel). This signals the topological transition point, where
according to the adiabatic theorem two gapped topologically different
phases are only connected through a gap closing. By further increasing
of the Zeeman field (bottom middle and right panels), @xmath , the
system enters into the topological phase and the superconducting regions
denoted by @xmath become topological, while the @xmath region remains in
the normal state (see Fig. 34 ). In the topological superconducting
nanowire, MBSs emerge at the end of the wire because it defines an
interface between two topologically different regions: the vacuum, which
is in the trivial phase and the topological superconducting wire.

In SNS junctions, on the other hand, MBSs are expected to appear for
@xmath at the ends of the two topological superconducting sectors @xmath
, since they define interfaces between topologically different regions:
the normal region @xmath and vacuum. This is what we indeed observe for
@xmath in Fig. 36 , where the low energy spectrum has Majorana
properties. For @xmath , the topological phase is characterised by the
emergence of two (almost) dispersionless levels with @xmath , which
represent the outer MBSs @xmath formed at the ends of the junction and
schematically shown in Fig. 35 . Additionally, two energy levels tend to
reach zero at @xmath and represent the inner MBSs @xmath formed inside
the junction. For sufficiently strong fields, @xmath , the lowest gap is
@xmath , which in principle bound the MBSs. Notice that the four MBSs
exhibit a considerable splitting around @xmath . This is a result of the
finite spatial overlap between the MBSs wave-functions, @xmath , being
@xmath the Majorana localisation length. The problem can be solved by
either increasing the spin-orbit coupling strength and therefore
reducing the Majorana localisation length, as discussed in Appendix K ,
or by increasing the length of the superconducting regions @xmath ,
which indeed demands longer computational times. Since realistic
experiments consider nanowires with an intrinsic spin-orbit coupling [
67 ] , which is a material property, for reducing the energy splitting
at @xmath we consider SNS junctions with longer superconducting regions,
@xmath . As an example, we present in Fig. 37 the energy levels as
function of the phase difference for @xmath . First, we notice that the
energy spectrum at @xmath for @xmath , exhibits a visible denser
spectrum than in Fig. 36 signalling the quasi-continuum of states. The
behaviour of the two different gaps remains as one increases @xmath .
Notice that in the topological phase, @xmath , the energy levels
associated to two outer MBSs are really dispersionless with @xmath and
therefore they can be considered as truly zero modes. Remarkably, the
energy splitting at @xmath is considerable reduced, however it will be
always non-zero, though not visible by naked eye, due to the finite
length and thus due to the presence of the outer MBSs. Observe also in
Fig. 37 that an increase in the length of the superconducting regions
favours the reduction of the detachment between the discrete spectrum
and the quasi-continuum at @xmath and @xmath , as it should be for a
ballistic junction [ 87 , 66 ] . In the topological phase it can be
associated to the finite spatial overlap between the wavefunctions of
the MBSs at the end of the S regions.

A true crossing is reached by considering semi-infinite superconducting
leads, @xmath , as it is done in Chap. Hybrid
superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful platforms to
study Majorana bound states . In such geometry the outer MBSs are not
present in the description of the system and the crossing at @xmath is
protected by conservation of the total fermion parity. Notice also that
Fig. 37 shows that the inner MBSs, the ones giving rise to ABSs due to
hybridization, are truly bound within @xmath , unlike Fig. 36 .

The energy levels dependence on the superconducting phase difference in
long SNS junctions is shown in Figs. 38 and 39 for @xmath and @xmath ,
respectively. In the introduction of this Chapter, Sec. 9 , we have
discussed the emergence of Andreev levels in short and long SNS
junctions. At this levels, neither Zeeman nor spin-orbit coupling were
considered. We have seen that a long SNS junction host more levels than
a short one. This is because in a longer junction more levels fit within
the region of length @xmath . We have obtained the behaviour of the
energy levels analytically taking into account a number of
approximations that in general are not necessarily true.

A long junction, at @xmath , contains more levels within the energy gap
@xmath than a short junction (see top left panels in Figs. 38 and 39 ).
This is expected as it is a situation similar to the one discussed in
Sec. 9 . When a finite Zeeman field is switched on, the two different
gaps, discussed in 5 , emerge (see top middle and right panels in Figs.
38 and 39 ).

As for short junctions, in long junctions, the Andreev energy spectrum
traces the closing of the low momentum gap @xmath , which reaches zero
at @xmath (see bottom left panels in Figs. 38 and 39 ). This signals the
topological phase transition point into the topological superconducting
phase, where the @xmath regions of the SNS junction become topological.
For @xmath , the four lowest levels represent the MBSs formed at the
ends of the two topological superconducting regions @xmath . Notice that
for strong Zeeman fields in the topological phase, the lowest gap is
@xmath and MBSs coexist with additional levels, which arise due to the
long length of the N region (see bottom left and right panels in Figs.
38 and 39 ).

When the length of the superconducting regions @xmath is increased,
@xmath , the two lowest energy levels do not disperse with @xmath and
the anti-crossing at @xmath is negligible. Thus, this anti-crossing can
be reduced as much as needed taking into account @xmath . In a junction
made of two semi-infinity wires, only the inner MBSs are present and the
crossing at @xmath is also protected by conservation of the total
fermion parity, as in the short junction regime.

The discussion made before can be clarified by considering the
dependence of the low-energy spectrum on the Zeeman field. This is shown
in Figs. 40 , 41 and 42 for short, intermediate and long SNS junctions
at (top row) @xmath and (bottom row) @xmath , while left column for
@xmath and right column for @xmath . As already discussed before for
superconducting wires or NS junctions, the low-energy levels as function
of the Zeeman field trace the gap inversion. Here, either at @xmath or
@xmath one clearly observes such prediction, with the sole difference
that at @xmath there are four lowest levels instead of two at @xmath ,
as can be indeed seen in the phase-dependence energy spectrum ( see for
instance Fig. 36 ). In the topological phase @xmath at @xmath , the four
lowest levels oscillate around zero energy for @xmath , while such
oscillations are remarkably suppressed by making the superconducting
section longer @xmath (see bottom panels of Figs. 40 , 41 and 42 ). On
the other hand, in the topological phase @xmath at @xmath , only the
outer MBSs are present developing an oscillatory patter for @xmath ,
which are suppressed for @xmath (see top panels of Figs. 40 , 41 and 42
).

An increase in the length of the normal section is reflected by
increasing the amount of levels in the energy spectrum. Indeed, observe
in Figs. 41 and 42 , for intermediate and long junctions, respectively,
that additional levels fit in the junction and they appear inside the
superconducting induced gap. As discussed before, in the topological
phase, @xmath , these levels tend to reduce the minigap (separation
between the energy levels oscillating around zero and the rest of the
spectrum). However, they also slightly reduce the amplitude of the
oscillations of the energy levels around zero in the topological phase
and therefore allowing such levels to reach their Majorana character in
reasonable long superconducting regions (see Figs. 41 and 42 ).

Notice that by comparing the low-energy spectrum of NS junctions, Figs.
30 , 31 and 32 with those of SNS junctions at @xmath , in the latter
additional levels are introduced and those arise from the finite left S
region which is considered to model the SNS junction. In the topological
phase these levels also slightly reduce the amplitude of the
oscillations of the lowest levels around zero, introducing also a
reduction of the mini-gap, which is bad for potential applications in
topological quantum computation as it determines the degree of
protection for the qubit. Although there are some limitations, these
hybrid systems offer a direct way for monitoring the dependence if the
MBSs on the superconducting phase difference, thus we believe that such
hybrid structures constitute a powerful platform for the search of MBSs
in one-dimensional systems.

To close this part, we emphasise that the energy spectrum of SNS
nanowire junctions offers the possibility to directly monitor the
Andreev bound states which trace the gap inversion and allows us to
investigate their evolution into Majorana bound states in a powerful
way.

#### 11.2 Josephson and critical currents

In Sec. 9 we have introduced how to calculate the Josephson current
based on the discrete Andreev spectrum of SNS junctions

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (88)
  -- -------- -- ------

Before going further we firstly discuss the validity of previous
equation in short and long junctions. Notice that we are considering SNS
junctions of finite length and therefore due to this fact their energy
spectrum is discrete. Indeed, it consists of a discrete spectrum wihin
the gap and of a quasi-continuum, which is also discrete due to the
finite length of the system, above the gap. Therefore, Eq. ( 88 ) allows
us to include the discrete quasi-continuum contribution in the
calculation of the Josephson current (supercurrent) @xmath . Having
established this we are in a position to use Eq. ( 88 ) for calculating
the Josephson current in both short and long SNS junctions.

Moreover, we define the critical current, @xmath , which is the maximum
supercurrent that flows across the junction. It is in general calculated
by maximizing the Josephson current @xmath with respect to the
superconducting phase difference @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (89)
  -- -------- -- ------

As before, here we present calculations for InSb nanowires, where the
spin-orbit strength is @xmath meVnm and the typical induced
superconducting gap @xmath meV [ 67 ] . We expect that the Josepshon and
the critical currents capture the presence of Majorana bound states for
realistic parameters.

Next, we present the Josephson current based on Eq. ( 88 ). In Figs. 43
and 44 we present the evolution with the Zeeman field of the Josephson
current as a function of the superconducting phase difference for finite
length short and long SNS junctions, respectively. Left row shows the
supercurrent for @xmath , while right row for @xmath . In short SNS
junctions (Fig. 43 ) at @xmath the Josephson current has the usual
sine-like behaviour, which is reduced as the Zeeman field increases due
to the reduction of the induced superconducting gap (see blue curves in
top row). Notice that the supercurrent develops two kinks just before
and after @xmath for finite Zeeman field @xmath (see top panels). These
correspond to the energy level crossings shown in Fig. 36 , which arise
due to SOC. Besides these features, the supercurrent curves for @xmath ,
for both @xmath and @xmath , exhibit a similar behaviour (see top row).

Interestingly, at the topological transition, @xmath , the system is
gapless but the current is not zero (see red curve in bottom row). For
@xmath , the S regions of the SNS junction become topological and
Majorana bound states emerge at the ends of S. We have shown in Sec. 5
that the combination of SOC, Zeeman interaction and @xmath -wave
superconductivity generates two intraband @xmath -wave pairings @xmath
and one interband @xmath -wave @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath denotes
the energy bands. These two @xmath sectors have different gaps @xmath at
low and high momemtum, respectively, that depend on the Zeeman field.
The gap @xmath is the topological gap which closes at @xmath and gives
rise to the topological phase for @xmath , while the high momentum gap
remains finite and roughly constat for strong SOC. We have also seen
that the topological phase is effectively reached due to the generation
of an effective @xmath -wave superconductor, which is the result of
projecting the system Hamiltonian onto the lower band keeping only the
intraband @xmath -wave pairing @xmath . Deep in the topological phase
the lowest gap is @xmath . We have shown in Fig. 36 that the Andreev
levels are associated with the gaps @xmath and they trace the closing of
the reopening of the gap. Remarkably, in the topological phase the
lowest gap is @xmath and therefore the number of levels within such gap
is less than in the trivial phase. This causes a reduction in the
supercurrent as it is the direct result of the Andreev levels (see
bottom row in Fig. 43 ). Interestingly, despite the presence of MBSs the
current is @xmath periodic. For @xmath , there is a finite spatial
Majorana wave function overlap and therefore the Josephson current in
the topological phase tends to decrease (black curves in bottom left
panel), while for @xmath such overlap is negligible and the current do
not decreases but it rather develops a clear sawtooth profile at @xmath
(see black curves in bottom right panel). Notice that the supercurrent
@xmath for @xmath shown in left ( @xmath ) and right ( @xmath ) top
panels of Fig. 43 exhibit a similar behaviour even despite the length of
the superconducting regions @xmath is different in both cases. Quite
remarkably the supercurrent for @xmath , shown in left and right bottom
panels of Fig. 43 , exhibits a different dependence on @xmath due to the
emergence of MBSs. While for @xmath (left bottom panel) the finite
spatial overlap of Majorana wave-functions obscures the direct detection
of MBSs, for @xmath (right bottom panel) the sawtooth profile at @xmath
determines the presence of MBSs and this happens only for @xmath .

As the length of the normal region is increased, one expects the
Josephson current to be reduced. This is shown in Fig. 44 for a long
junction considering @xmath and @xmath and spanning the trivial and
topological phase. Notice that although the amplitude of the current is
reduced in this case, the behaviour is similar to the short junction
regime. Indeed, in the trivial phase (blue curves in top row), as one
increases the Zeeman field, the current gets reduced. As the system
enters into the topological phase, we distinguish two situations. For a
finite Majorana wave function overlap @xmath , in the topological phase,
the current decreases signalling the non-zero splitting at @xmath in the
energy spectrum. However, for @xmath , as the Zeeman field increases in
the topological phase, the Josephson current acquires a constant value
and it develops a clear sawtooth signature at @xmath due fact that the
splitting in the energy spectrum at @xmath is zero.

Now, we present results for the critical current in short SNS junctions.

In Fig. 45 we present calculations of the critical current @xmath in
short SNS junctions as the Zeeman field @xmath increases from the
trivial ( @xmath ) to the topological phase ( @xmath ). Different curves
in top left panel correspond to different values of the superconducting
region length @xmath . Observe that the current is maximum at zero field
and as the Zeeman field @xmath increases the current decreases almost
linearly tracing the reduction of the low-momentum gap @xmath discussed
in Sec. 5 . We have shown that such gap closes at @xmath and marks the
topological transition point into the topological superconducting phase
with MBSs.

Remarkably, at the topological transition, @xmath , the critical current
remains finite and develops a robust non-trivial feature, which is the
result of the closing of the gap in the energy spectrum. Roughly
speaking half of its value at @xmath because the system is losing one
channel after the topological transition. As the the Zeeman field is
further increased for @xmath , the critical current develop
oscillations, which arise from the finite spatial overlap of the
Majorana wave functions when @xmath . Notice that one way to reduce such
overlap consists of increasing @xmath , as it can be seen in top left
panel. On the other hand, one can also reduce it by increasing the SOC
and therefore decreasing the Majorana localisation length, as shown in
top right panel. Although both ways are efficient, the former is more
realistic including the variation of the length of the proximitized
region, while the latter requires to increase a material property (the
SOC) or to increase it by electrostatic gates, which is not an easy task
at all. Notice that while in the former case, the effect of increasing
@xmath only reduces the oscillations of the critical current in the
topological phase without affecting its value in general, in the latter
situation, by increasing the SOC, the critical current is increased.
Experimentally, however, is not very easy to fabricate SNS junctions
with a perfect coupling between N and S regions, although recently there
has been a considerable increase in fabrication techniques of such
systems. In subsection 10.4 , we have shown that the coupling between
the N and S regions can be parametrised by the parameter @xmath . In
principle, by varying such coupling, one can control the transparency,
where @xmath determines a full transparent junction. In bottom panel of
Fig. 45 we show the critical current as a function of the Zeeman field
for different values of @xmath in a finite length SNS short junction.

Notice that as the control parameter @xmath decreases, the critical
current also decreases. In the trivial phase, @xmath , for small values
of @xmath , the critical current is considerable reduced and even zero.
Remarkable, however, the critical current develops a robust feature at
the closing of the topological gap and it exhibits a finite value for
all @xmath . In the topological phase, @xmath , the critical current
shows a non-monotonic behaviour for increasing @xmath with oscillations
due to Majorana overlap.

Thus, from changes in @xmath these features could be used to detect the
topological transition and therefore the topological phase with Majorana
bound states.

### 12 Conclusions

In this Chapter we have introduced the basic phenomena that takes place
in hybrid NS and SNS junctions. Then, we have shown how to model such
systems based on nanowires with spin-orbit coupling assuming good
contact between nanowire and superconductor.

A detailed study of the Andreev bound states have been presented and the
emergence of Majorana bound states have been investigated for short and
long SNS junctions. In this part, we showed the Andreev bound states as
function of the superconducting phase difference for different values of
the Zeeman field, spanning the trivial and topological phases. At this
level, we point out that, in principle, Andreev levels spectroscopy
should be able to test the emergence of MBSs.

Afterwards we have focused on the Josephson current dependence on the
superconducting phase difference, calculated from the Adreev spectrum in
short and long SNS junctions. We have found that the presence of MBSs in
the topological phase is a distinguishable signature in the Josephson
current despite of being @xmath periodic. Indeed, in the topological
regime, the Josephson current is reduced since the number of ABSs is
reduced. Additionally, when the spatial overlap is negligible between
the MBSs, the Andreev spectrum is translated into the Josephson current
in a clear sawtooth profile at @xmath , representing a clear
manifestation of the MBSs.

We also present the critical current as a function of the Zeeman field.
This quantity allows us to make a detailed study of the topological
transition and trace the behaviour of the topological gap, which after
the band inversion gives rise to the topological phase with MBSs. We
report that the topological transition point is a robust feature, which
we expect to be distinguishable from other mechanisms in real
experiments.

## Chapter \thechapter Voltage-biased transport in SNS
junctions121212The results presented in this chapter have been published
in [138].

We study transport in a voltage biased
superconductor-normal-superconductor (SNS) junction made of
semiconducting nanowires with strong spin-orbit coupling, as it
transitions into a topological superconducting phase for increasing
Zeeman field. Despite the absence of a fractional steady-state ac
Josephson current in the topological phase, the dissipative multiple
Andreev reflection (MAR) current @xmath at different junction
transparencies is particularly revealing. It exhibits unique features
related to topology, such as the gap inversion, the formation of
Majorana bound states, and fermion-parity conservation. Moreover, the
critical current @xmath , which remarkably does not vanish at the
critical point where the system becomes gapless, provides direct
evidence of the topological transition. These results demonstrate the
feasibility to probe the formation of Majorana states without the need
of phase sensitive or noise-related measurements. Therefore, for
junctions with tuneable transparency, this collection of signatures
constitutes an unmistakable fingerprint of Majorana bound states.

### 13 Introduction

In Chapter Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as
useful platforms to study Majorana bound states we have shown that
semiconducting nanowires (NWs) with a strong spin-orbit (SO) coupling in
the proximity of s-wave superconductors and in the presence of an
external Zeeman magnetic field @xmath are a promising platform to study
Majorana physics. Theory predicts that above a critical field @xmath ,
defined in terms of the Fermi energy @xmath and the induced s-wave
pairing @xmath , the wire undergoes a topological transition into a
phase hosting zero energy Majorana bound states (MBSs) at the ends of
the wire [ 61 , 150 ] . We have discussed in Chapter Hybrid
superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful platforms to
study Majorana bound states that the emergence of a zero-bias peak in
the differential conductance @xmath supports the existence of MBSs at
normal-superconductor (NS) junctions. Stronger evidence could be
provided by the observation of non-Abelian interference (braiding) [ 85
] , or by transport in phase-sensitive
superconductor-normal-superconductor (SNS) junctions. The latter
approach, which typically involves the measurement of an anomalous
“fractional" @xmath -periodic ac Josephson effect [ 86 , 66 , 87 ] , is
much less demanding than performing braiding. Realistically, however,
the fractional effect, detected through, e.g., the absence of odd steps
in Shapiro experiments [ 87 , 88 , 89 , 90 ] , may be difficult to
measure (dissipation is expected to destroy it in the steady state), or
may even develop without relation to topology [ 91 ] . Although it has
been shown that the @xmath periodicity survives in the dynamics, such as
noise and transients [ 72 , 92 , 93 ] , simpler experimental probes of
MBSs are extremely desirable.

Here we propose the multiple Andreev reflection (MAR) current in
voltage-biased SNS junctions made of NWs [ 78 , 99 ] as an alternative,
remarkably powerful, yet simple tool to study the topological
transition. This is made possible by the direct effect that gap
inversion, MBS formation and fermion-parity conservation have on the MAR
current @xmath at various junction transparencies @xmath . For tunnel
junctions, @xmath traces the closing and reopening of the
superconducting gap at @xmath , @xmath . This gap inversion can be shown
to be a true topological transition by tuning the junction to perfect
transparency @xmath . In this regime, the limiting current @xmath shows
signatures of the parity conservation effects that are responsible for
the fractional Josephson current in the presence of MBSs, but which, in
contrast to the latter, survive in the steady state limit. Moreover, the
detailed dependence of MAR as a function of @xmath has the fundamental
advantage over NS junctions in that it contains information about the
peculiar dependence of MBS hybridization with superconductor phase
difference @xmath , despite not requiring any external control on it.
Similarly, we show that another important phase-insensitive quantity,
the critical current @xmath , remains unexpectedly finite for all @xmath
due to a significant continuum contribution, and exhibits an anomaly at
the topological transition.

This chapter is organized as follows. In section 14 , we review the
model for Rashba nanowires in the presence of both s-wave
superconducting pairing and an external Zeeman field and describe how a
spinless p-wave superconductor regime can be achieved. In particular, we
discuss how the problem can be understood in terms of two independent
p-wave superconductors, originated from the Rashba helical bands, and
weakly coupled by an interband pairing term. This two-band description
is very useful in order to understand the main results of this paper.
Such results are discussed in section 15 which is divided in two parts.
The first part (subsection 15.1 ) is devoted to the ABSs which are
confined in the junction. The detailed evolution of these ABSs as the
system undergoes a topological transition has not been discussed in the
literature, to the best of our knowledge, and becomes essential in order
to gain a deep understanding of transport across the junction, which is
discussed in subsection 15.2 . In this part we study the ac Josephson
effect in nanowire SNS junctions, with focus on how the MAR currents
reflect the topological transition in the nanowires as the Zeeman field
increases. In particular, we present a thorough analysis of MAR
transport in topological SNS junctions for arbitrary transparency of the
normal part. Finally, we discuss in section 16 how the critical current
@xmath does not vanish at the critical point where the system becomes
gapless and, importantly, how @xmath provides direct evidence of the
topological transition.

### 14 Rashba nanowire model and effective p-wave pairing

Before going further we firstly review the possibility for engineering
one-dimensional topological superconductivity based based on nanowires
with SOC in proximity to a @xmath -wave superconductor (see Chapter
Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful
platforms to study Majorana bound states for more details). A single
one-dimensional NW in the normal state is described by the Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (90)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the effective mass, @xmath the SO strength, @xmath the
chemical potential and @xmath the spin Pauli matrices. An external
magnetic field @xmath along the wire produces a Zeeman splitting @xmath
, where @xmath is the Bohr magneton and @xmath is the wire g-factor. The
Nambu Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (91)
  -- -------- -- ------

models the NW in the presence of an induced s-wave superconducting
pairing @xmath (here assumed real without loss of generality). The
essential ingredient for a topological superconductor is an effective
p-wave pairing acting on a single (“spinless") fermionic species [ 86 ]
. SO coupling splits NW states into two subbands of opposite helicity at
@xmath . At finite @xmath , these two subbands, which we label @xmath
and @xmath [black and orange lines in Fig. 46 (a)], have spins canted
away from the SO axis. Notice that here we have a notation opposite to
the one given in Chap. Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire
junctions as useful platforms to study Majorana bound states . The
s-wave pairing @xmath , expressed in the @xmath basis, takes the form of
an intraband p-wave @xmath , plus an interband s-wave pairing @xmath [
51 ] .

Without the latter, the problem decouples into two independent p-wave
superconductors, while @xmath acts as a weak coupling between them. Each
quasi-independent @xmath sector has a different ( @xmath -dependent)
gap, which we call @xmath (at small @xmath ) and @xmath (large @xmath ),
see Fig. 46 (a,b). While @xmath remains roughly constant with @xmath
(for strong SO coupling [ 70 , 71 ] ), @xmath vanishes linearly as
@xmath approaches the critical field, @xmath ¹⁴ ¹⁴ 14 Note that, in
general, @xmath is at a small but finite momentum. However, as @xmath
approaches @xmath , @xmath becomes centered at @xmath and is
approximately equal to @xmath , where @xmath is the zero momentum energy
of the lowest subband, @xmath , and is related to the topological charge
of the lowest superconducting band. [ 151 ] . This closing and reopening
(gap inversion) signals a topological transition, induced by the
effective removal of the @xmath sector away from the low-energy problem.
Below @xmath the NW is composed of two spinless p-wave superconductors,
and is therefore topologically trivial. Above @xmath , @xmath is no
longer a p-wave gap, but rather a normal (Zeeman) spectral gap already
present in the normal state, transforming the wire into a single-species
p-wave superconductor with non-trivial topology. This phase contains
MBSs, protected by the effective gap @xmath , at the wire ends. Above a
certain field @xmath , the gap @xmath saturates at @xmath and the
physics of superconducting helical edge states in spin-Hall insulators
is recovered [ 66 , 72 ] .

### 15 Nanowire SNS junctions

In the previous section we described how a semiconducting nanowire with
a strong SO coupling in the proximity of an s-wave superconductor and in
the presence of an external Zeeman magnetic field @xmath behaves as a
topological superconductor above a critical field @xmath . See also
Chapter Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful
platforms to study Majorana bound states for further details.

Here we are concerned with the effects of this topological transition on
the MAR current @xmath across junctions formed with such nanowires. In
particular, we consider SNS junctions of different normal transparencies
@xmath . Experimentally, such geometry can be fabricated by partially
covering a single NW with two superconducting leads and leaving an
uncovered normal region in the middle. The coupling of the normal part
of the NW to the superconducting leads can be tuned by local control of
the electron density with a gated constriction. This can be realized by
using, e.g., bottom-gates forming a quantum point contact, see Fig. 47 .
Such geometry has been successfully implemented experimentally in Ref. [
48 ] for NS junctions, where control of the coupling between the
superconducting and normal sections from near pinch-off (tunneling
limit) to the multichannel regime is demonstrated. We point out that the
SNS junctions taken into account here differ from the ones discussed in
Chapter Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful
platforms to study Majorana bound states in that the superconducting
leads are semi-infinite unlike the finite length ones in Chapter Hybrid
superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful platforms to
study Majorana bound states .

For simplicity, here we focus on short SNS junctions ¹⁵ ¹⁵ 15 Results
for the long junction limit are discussed in Chap. Hybrid
superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful platforms to
study Majorana bound states with single channel nanowires. For
computation purposes, we consider a discretisation of the continuum
model Eq. ( 90 ) for the Rashba nanowire into a tight-binding lattice
with a small lattice spacing @xmath , as describes in Chapter Hybrid
superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful platforms to
study Majorana bound states . This transforms terms containing the
momentum operator @xmath into nearest-neighbour hopping matrices @xmath
. Namely @xmath , with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

are matrices in spin space, and @xmath . The pairing is incorporated
like in Eq. ( 91 ). A short SNS junction is modelled by suppressing the
hopping matrix @xmath between two sites in the middle of the wire, which
represent the junction. The dimensionless factor @xmath controls the
junction’s normal transparency at @xmath , which we denote @xmath . A
phase difference @xmath across the junction is implemented by
multiplying @xmath to the left and right of the junction by @xmath ,
respectively. Despite the simplicity of this description, it contains
the relevant physics of a short SNS junction. As it has been shown for
standard junctions [ 152 ] , such physics essentially depend on the
contact normal transmission as well as the voltage drop across it ¹⁶ ¹⁶
16 Note that, for the sake of simplicity, we do not include the
possibility of junctions containing resonant levels or quantum dots. A
study of such junctions, including Coulomb blockade effects, is beyond
the scope of this paper but might be useful in order to analyse the
possibility of Majorana physics arising in experiments with short SNS
junctions containing quantum dot nanowires, such as the ones reported in
Ref. [ 128 ] . Thus, we expect that a more detailed modeling, including
e.g. a spatially-dependent voltage drop, would only modify the effective
transmission @xmath which defines the different regimes we shall explain
in the following.

#### 15.1 Andreev bound states

In Chapter Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as
useful platforms to study Majorana bound states finite length SNS
junctions and therefore we discussed the system with four MBSs, two
inner at the junction and two outer at the ends of the superconducting
regions. Here, however, take into account semi-infinite superconducting
leads so that the outer MBSs are not involved in the description.

In such short SNS junction, an ABS should form for each of the two
p-wave sectors described in section 14 for @xmath , while only one,
associated to @xmath , should remain for @xmath . To support this
picture, we present calculations of the local density of states (LDOS)
at the junction in the transparent limit ( @xmath ). This LDOS is peaked
at the energy @xmath of the ABS, which is a function of the phase
difference @xmath across the junction. For @xmath (Fig. 48 a) the two
ABSs are degenerate and confined within the gap @xmath ¹⁷ ¹⁷ 17 Note
that even this non-topological case is anomalous as the ABS energies do
not reach zero at @xmath , unlike predicted by the standard theory for a
transparent channel @xmath within the Andreev approximation @xmath [ 144
] . We have checked that the energy minimum @xmath does indeed vanish as
@xmath grows, see Fig. 95 in H . As the Zeeman field increases, Fig. 48
b, the two ABS split and the system develops the two distinct gaps
@xmath and @xmath described in Section 14 . Note that both ABSs are
truly bound at energies below the lowest gap @xmath , but only
quasibound in the energy window @xmath . This is clearly seen in the
plots as broadening of the ABS resonances (see, e.g. Fig. 48 c). As
@xmath approaches the critical field @xmath , @xmath gets reduced, and
becomes exactly zero at @xmath . Note that at this point the upper ABS
has reached zero energy at @xmath and is quasibound for all energies,
Fig. 48 d. Upon entering the topological phase ( @xmath ), @xmath
reopens but one of the ABSs of the problem has disappeared (Fig. 48 e).
The surviving ABS associated to @xmath arises as the hybridisation of
the two emerging MBSs across the junction. Global fermion-parity
conservation protects the @xmath level crossing. Due to the residual
@xmath coupling between the two sectors, the @xmath Andreev state is
once more quasibound in the energy window @xmath . At high enough
magnetic fields, @xmath is the smallest gap of the problem and hence the
Majorana ABS is truly bound, Fig. 48 f. In long junctions, more ABSs can
be confined in the junction as discussed in Chap. Hybrid
superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful platforms to
study Majorana bound states [ 139 , 153 ] . These extra ABSs coexist
with the ones described here and may, for example, anti-cross with the
Majorana-like @xmath Andreev level, affecting its character near zero
energy [ 70 , 139 ] .

#### 15.2 ac Josephson effect and MAR currents

Under a constant voltage bias @xmath , the pairings @xmath to the left
and right of the junction acquire an opposite and time-dependent phase
difference,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (92)
  -- -------- -- ------

This induces Landau-Zener transitions between the ABSs and into the
continuum, thereby developing a time dependent Josephson current with
both @xmath and @xmath components. Such is the point of view in e.g.
Refs. [ 154 , 92 ] . Alternatively, @xmath can be gauged away into the
hopping across the junction, @xmath , where @xmath is the @xmath -Pauli
matrix in Nambu space. By employing Keldysh-Floquet theory [ 152 , 155 ]
, we obtain the stationary-state time-dependent ac Josephson current

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (93)
  -- -------- -- ------

(note that only even harmonics survive, see F for full details). Here,
we concentrate on the dc-current @xmath . The results for @xmath at
small, intermediate and full transparency are summarised in Fig. 49
(a-c) for increasing values of @xmath spanning the topological
transition.

##### 15.2.1 Tunneling regime.

For non-topological tunnel junctions, dc-transport vanishes below an
abrupt threshold voltage (Fig. 49 (a), blue curves)

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (94)
  -- -------- -- ------

This well known result follows from the fact that there are no
quasiparticle excitations in the decoupled wires for energy @xmath if
@xmath . Indeed, to second order in perturbation theory in @xmath , the
MAR current takes the form of a convolution between @xmath and @xmath ,
where @xmath is the decoupled ( @xmath ) spectral density at each side
of the junction ( G ). [The trace of @xmath , proportional to the LDOS,
is shown in Fig. 50 (a)]. Hence, as @xmath increases, the tunnelling
current threshold follows the closing of the gap in the LDOS, until
@xmath vanishes and @xmath becomes linear in small @xmath at @xmath
(black curve). As @xmath , the gap reopens, but the threshold is now
halved to (Fig. 49 (a), red curves)

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (95)
  -- -------- -- ------

Note that the small step visible at @xmath is the second-order MAR,
whose relative height vanishes as @xmath . The change, easily detectable
as a halving of the slope of the threshold @xmath across @xmath , is due
to the emergence of an intra-gap zero-energy MBS in the topological
phase [see zero energy peak in Fig. 50 (a)], which opens a tunnelling
transport channel from or into the new zero energy state. Moreover, when
@xmath , @xmath surpasses @xmath , and @xmath saturates at @xmath . This
is directly visible in @xmath as a kink at @xmath [see dashed and dotted
lines in Fig. 49 (a)] ¹⁸ ¹⁸ 18 Similar considerations may apply to
recent experiments with lead nanoconstrictions formed in an STM tip, see
Ref. [ 156 ] . .

##### 15.2.2 Intermediate transparency regime.

As transparency increases, subharmonic MAR steps develop at voltages

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (96)
  -- -------- -- ------

as shown Fig. 49 (b) The specific profile of each step with @xmath still
contains information on the LDOS of the junction at energies around
@xmath . At @xmath , the power-law LDOS for @xmath results in a
staircase-like curve @xmath [blue line in Fig. 49 (d)]. This shape is
roughly preserved up to @xmath . For @xmath the MAR profile changes
qualitatively, however. The subharmonic threshold voltages

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (97)
  -- -------- -- ------

are halved (since @xmath is halved), and the MAR current profile becomes
oscillatory instead of step-like. A blowup of the oscillations is
presented in Fig. 49 (d) (red curve), together with guidelines for the
corresponding @xmath in gray.

The emergence of oscillatory MAR steps, which here is connected to the
formation of zero energy peaks in the LDOS owing to the localized MBSs,
is well known in Josephson junctions containing a resonant level [ 157 ,
158 , 159 ] . Note, however, that the oscillations in a topologically
trivial system, such as for instance a quantum dot between two
superconductors, arise at odd fractions of @xmath , i.e. at voltages
@xmath , instead of the @xmath of the Majorana case. Interestingly, this
difference is ultimately due to the fact that a resonant level spatially
localised within the junction cannot carry current directly into the
reservoirs, while a zero energy MBS (essentially half a non local
fermion) can. This same situation arises in @xmath -wave Josephson
junctions, which also exhibit oscillatory @xmath MAR subharmonics owing
to the presence of mid gap states [ 160 ] .

##### 15.2.3 Transparent limit.

In the limit @xmath , ABS energies @xmath [Fig. 48 (c)] touch the
continuum at @xmath . This has an important consequence. From the
Landau-Zener point of view of the ac Josephson effect [ 154 ] , the time
dependence of @xmath for an arbitrarily small @xmath will induce the
escape of any quasiparticle occupying an ABS into the continuum after a
single @xmath cycle. A given ABS becomes occupied with high probability
in each cycle around @xmath if the rate @xmath exceeds its energy
minimum @xmath . (Recall this energy is finite, since the Andreev
approximation does not apply, see H .) One quasiparticle is then
injected into the continuum per cycle, and a finite @xmath arises. Below
such voltage, however, the ABS remains empty, so that if @xmath is
finite, as is the case of a realistic non-topological junction [see Fig.
48 (a-c)], one obtains @xmath (valid for any transparency at @xmath ).
This is in contrast to the conventional @xmath , @xmath result @xmath ,
predicted within the Andreev approximation ( @xmath ).

After the topological transition, this picture changes dramatically. The
two MBSs at each side of the junction hybridise for a given @xmath into
a single ABS. This seemingly innocent change has a notable consequence.
Since fermion parity in the superconducting wires is globally preserved,
an anticrossing at @xmath , which would represent a mixing of a state
with one and zero fermions in the lone ABS, is forbidden. Parity
conservation therefore imposes @xmath in the presence of MBSs,
irrespective of @xmath or @xmath ¹⁹ ¹⁹ 19 Note that residual splitting
may survive in the topological phase for finite length nanowires, for
which a finite (albeit exponentially small) coupling between four MBSs
exist. . This is a true topologically protected property of the
junction, and gives rise to a finite @xmath , i.e. half the value
expected for the non-topological junction in the Andreev approximation.
This abrupt change is shown in Fig. 49 (c,e). The @xmath MAR current in
transparent junctions, therefore, directly probes the emergence of
parity protection.

### 16 Critical current

In the transparent limit, a supercurrent peak [ 78 , 99 , 161 ] may
hinder the experimental identification of the @xmath limit, but itself
holds valuable information about the transition. The critical current
@xmath may be computed in general by maximizing the @xmath
(time-independent) current @xmath respect to @xmath (including the
contribution from the continuum) as shown in the last part of Chapter
Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful
platforms to study Majorana bound states . For a short transparent
junction at @xmath , @xmath is maximum, and equal to @xmath in the
Andreev approximation. Fig. 50 (b) shows @xmath for increasing values of
@xmath . Naively, one may expect that a junction without a
superconducting gap should not carry a finite supercurrent, but this is
not the case here. At @xmath , @xmath is finite ²⁰ ²⁰ 20 Note also that
in junctions with trivial superconductors, @xmath as the nanowire
becomes helical at @xmath [ 162 ] . Our result is therefore another
nontrivial consequence of topology in the junction. , while @xmath [the
junction LDOS at criticality is also gapless, see Fig. 50 (a)]. This
gapless supercurrent comes from the @xmath quasi-bound Andreev state in
the continuum, which contributes almost as if it were a subgap ABS. It
is thus a reasonable approximation to write @xmath as the sum of the
critical current from each ABS. For @xmath , @xmath . The @xmath
contribution, however, should not be included for @xmath , leading to a
discontinuity in @xmath . This simple model gives a qualitative fit
[dotted line in Fig. 50 (b)] to the exact numerics (solid line), with
deviations coming from corrections to the Andreev approximation, and
contributions above @xmath . Additional deviations in experiments,
coming e.g. from the finite impedance of the electromagnetic
environment, are not expected to alter the discontinuity in @xmath ,
which remains a signature of the topological transition.

Note that we also present results for the critical current in short SNS
junctions in Chap. Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire
junctions as useful platforms to study Majorana bound states .

### 17 Conclusions

In conclusion, we have shown that the dc-current in voltage biased
Josephson junctions is a flexible experimental probe into the various
aspects of the topological superconducting transition in semiconducting
nanowires. Tuning the junction transparency one may obtain evidence of
MBS formation as conclusive as a fractional Josephson effect, without
requiring control of the junction phase. Moreover, we have found that
the critical current in the wire does not vanish at the transition due
to above-gap contributions, although its derivative with @xmath exhibits
a discontinuity as a result of the disappearance of one ABS. This
behavior of @xmath provides a direct evidence of the topological
transition. MAR spectroscopy and critical current measurements in
nanowires similar to the ones studied here have already been reported [
78 , 99 ] .

Although we have focused here on the simplest case (single-band, short
junction limit) we expect the main features of the topological
transition to remain robust under more general conditions. Preliminary
results in the quasi-one dimensional multiband case show that @xmath is
a non-monotonic function for increasing magnetic fields. For weak
interband SO mixing [ 75 ] , the behavior discussed in Fig. 50 (b) can
be generalized and @xmath presents a series of minima at different
fields corresponding to the topological transition of each subband.

Importantly, the alternative physical scenarios, such as, e. g.,
disorder [ 101 , 105 , 83 , 106 ] or Andreev bound states [ 49 ] , that
produce ZBAs in NS junctions (and thus mimic Majorana physics), cannot
give the distinct features associated to global parity that were
discussed here for SNS junctions. We therefore believe that experiments
along the lines discussed in this paper could provide the first
unambiguous report of a topological transition in nanowires, and the
emergence of Majorana bound states.

## Chapter \thechapter SNS junctions in nanowires with spin-orbit
coupling: role of confinement and helicity on the sub-gap
spectrum212121The results presented in this chapter have been published
in [139].

We study normal transport and the sub-gap spectrum of
superconductor-normal-superconductor (SNS) junctions made of
semiconducting nanowires with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We
focus, in particular, on the role of confinement effects in long
ballistic junctions. In the normal regime, scattering at the two
contacts gives rise to two distinct features in conductance, Fabry-Perot
resonances and Fano dips. The latter arise in the presence of a strong
Zeeman field @xmath that removes a spin sector in the leads ( helical
leads), but not in the central region. Conversely, a helical central
region between non-helical leads exhibits helical gaps of half-quantum
conductance, with superimposed helical Fabry-Perot oscillations. These
normal features translate into distinct subgap states when the leads
become superconducting. In particular, Fabry-Perot resonances within the
helical gap become parity-protected zero-energy states (parity
crossings), well below the critical field @xmath at which the
superconducting leads become topological. As a function of Zeeman field
or Fermi energy, these zero-modes oscillate around zero energy, forming
characteristic loops, which evolve continuously into Majorana bound
states as @xmath exceeds @xmath . The relation with the physics of
parity crossings of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states is discussed.

### 18 Introduction

Majorana fermions, particles that are their own antiparticles, have been
the subject of intense research over the past decades in the context of
particle physics and cosmology [ 30 , 163 ] . In Chapter Hybrid
superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful platforms to
study Majorana bound states we have discussed that during last few years
this interest extended to the condensed matter arena where Majorana
fermions are intensely studied nowadays [ 31 , 53 ] . This state of
affairs has been driven by the key observation that emergent
quasiparticles in superconductors can be described as Majorana fermions
[ 51 , 164 , 29 , 52 , 53 ] . This, together with the recent advances in
the field of topological materials [ 6 , 7 ] , has spurred an intense
search for condensed matter realizations of Majorana fermions. Most of
these realizations focus on zero-energy modes inside the gap of
topological superconductors. Thus, instead of Majorana fermions, they
are now more precisely referred to as Majorana bound states (MBSs) or
Majorana zero modes. ²³ ²³ 23 It has been argued that Bogoliubov
quasiparticles in conventional superconductors are true Majorana
fermions [ 32 ] ). Their Majorana fermion nature can be revealed by
annihilation processes, see [ 165 ] . .

We have seen in Chapter Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire
junctions as useful platforms to study Majorana bound states that MBSs
can emerge in exotic superconductors, such as p-wave, since they realize
topological phases that support edge excitations with Majorana fermion
character [ 166 , 28 , 167 , 23 , 27 , 168 ] . and a physical promising
platform is based on the proximity effect between a conventional s-wave
superconductor and a semiconductor nanowire (NW) with strong spin-orbit
(SO) coupling [ 169 , 38 , 39 , 61 , 150 ] . It has been shown [ 61 ,
150 ] that if an external Zeeman field @xmath , orthogonal to the SO
axis, exceeds a critical value @xmath , where @xmath is the Fermi energy
and @xmath the induced s-wave pairing, zero energy MBSs emerge at the
nanowire ends signaling a topologically non-trivial phase.

Unfortunately, the outcome of the simplest detection protocol for MBSs
in NW devices [ 110 , 111 , 81 ] , detection of subgap zero modes
through zero-bias anomalies in transport [ 67 , 128 , 46 , 47 , 48 , 49
] , can be obscured, or even mimicked, by other effects as discussed in
Chapter Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful
platforms to study Majorana bound states [ 103 , 101 , 105 , 83 , 106 ,
70 , 107 , 104 ] . In this Chapter we go beyond zero-bias anomaly
experiments and study more complex geometries such as
Superconductor-Normal-Superconductor (SNS) junctions [ 126 , 127 , 170 ]
. This geometry has a number of advantages including the possibility of
studying supercurrents [ 128 , 78 , 98 , 99 , 129 ] , or direct
spectroscopy of Andreev bound states (ABS) [ 130 , 131 , 132 , 133 , 134
, 135 , 136 , 49 , 137 ] as shown in Chapter Hybrid
superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful platforms to
study Majorana bound states . As we shall discuss, this latter technique
can be used, in principle, to directly monitor the detailed evolution
from the trivial to the nontrivial regime (see also Hybrid
superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful platforms to
study Majorana bound states ). Previous papers have mostly focused on
short junctions [ 126 , 171 , 172 , 173 , 174 ] and detailed studies of
ABS in long and intermediate-length junctions has been carried out in
Chap. Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful
platforms to study Majorana bound states , while the study of other
effects (such as confinement and helicity) remain largely unaddressed.
In particular, the role of Fabry-Perot resonances occurring in normal
transport as the middle NW finite-lenght section of the junction is
depleted has never been studied to the best of our knowledge. In this
work we fill this void and present detailed calculations of the normal
conductance and Andreev spectra in such geometries. We emphasize here
that all nanowire experiments should ideally belong to the category
studied here, as confinement effects should be present when a ballistic
quasi-one dimensional conductor is contacted between leads, especially
when the normal part of the NW (in our geometry, the region of length
@xmath not directly in contact with leads) is gated. This electrical
gating naturally creates quantum wells (or barriers) with their
associated confined quantum levels in the middle region of the NW.

In the first half of this work, we discuss normal transport across a
finite length ballistic NW. We show how bandstructure details in the
presence of strong Rashba SO coupling and Zeeman fields may dominate
transport, and give rise to distinct features associated to helical
phases (defined by singly-degenerate subbands at the Fermi level with
spin locked to momentum) known as helical gaps (Fig. 51 ). Likewise,
finite contact resistance induces confinement resonances in conductance
as quasibound states develop in the NW. In the simplest case of
non-interacting electrons ²⁴ ²⁴ 24 Coulomb blockade effects will be
discussed elsewhere. , we find that confinement generates two types of
resonances: Fabry-Perot resonances and helical Fano dips. Fabry-Perot
resonances for a spinful mode [ 175 ] will give conductance oscillations
with a ceiling of @xmath , unless the central NW is depleted into its
helical regime, in which case one may observe helical Fabry-Perot
resonances with a half-quantum @xmath ceiling. For long enough
junctions, many helical Fabry-Perot resonances may occur. We discuss
that, while confinement effects may mask the helical gap, the
characteristic reentrance of helical Fabry-Perot resonances with Zeeman
field or gate voltage contains valuable information about non-trivial
helical transport through the NW. The second kind of resonances are
sharp Fano dips when the central section of the NW is gated to form a
quantum well (non-helical) and the NW sections below the contacts (the
leads) are helical. Therefore, both types of resonant features in normal
transport may signal the helical regime in different sections (central
or below the contacts) of the NW. In the presence of superconducting
leads, the two lead to distinct effects.

In the second half of this work we consider the connection of this
phenomenology to transport in the superconducting regime. Each helical
Fano dip in the normal phase translates, in an SNS geometry, into a
single subgap state that crosses zero energy as a function of external
parameters (Fermi energy or Zeeman field). Such a crossing is often
known as a parity crossing , since it is protected by conservation of
number parity in the junction. As we discuss, these parity crossings are
made possible by the nontrivial topology in the underlying effective
p-wave superconductor for @xmath . Similar bound states originated from
nonmagnetic impurities in topological superconductors and superfluids
have been recently discussed in Refs. [ 176 , 177 ] and can be
considered the p-wave counterparts of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states [
178 , 179 , 180 , 181 , 182 ] in standard s-wave superconductors with
magnetic impurities. A more direct analogy with standard
Yu-Shiba-Rusinov magnetic bound states actually applies in the
non-topological phase @xmath . In this situation, helical Fabry-Perot
resonances in normal conductance translate, in the superconducting
regime, into loops around zero energy in the ABS spectrum as a function
of external parameters. For long junctions, many of these loops are
visible, each separated by a parity crossing at zero energy. As a
result, the @xmath subgap spectrum contains near-zero energy subgap
states that oscillate as a function of Fermi energy or Zeeman field when
the N region of the junction is helical. Interestingly, we find that
these oscillating near-zero subgap states in the trivial regime are
smoothly connected to MBS when Zeeman is increased beyond @xmath .

This paper is organized as follows. In section 19 we describe the
Hamiltonian model employed in our work. Section 20 focuses on the normal
conductance and how the two types of resonances, helical Fabry-Perot and
helical Fano dips, appear in the system. The rest of the paper is
devoted to analysing the consequences of these resonant levels in the
sub-gap spectrum in the superconducting regime. After a brief discussion
on how the SNS junction is modeled, as well as a discussion about the
relevant length scales of the problem, section 21 presents a systematic
study of the subgap spectrum of SNS junctions, including its dependence
on the superconducting phase difference across the junction, @xmath . We
discuss in detail how the presence of confined levels within the central
region affect the ABS and lead to parity crossings in the topological
phase. The dependence of the ABS on phase difference, Fermi energy of
the normal region and Zeeman field is discussed for both short and long
junctions in subsections 21.2 and 21.3 , respectively. Our conclusions
are presented in Section 22 . Here we employ the model described in
detail in Section 10.4 of Chapter Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor
nanowire junctions as useful platforms to study Majorana bound states
for SNS junctions by using a tight-binding version of the continuum
model Hamiltonian. Appendix J discusses an effective model that fully
explains the phenomenology behind helical Fano resonances.

### 19 Nanowire model

We present the model for a nanowire with Rashba SOC and in the presence
of an external Zeeman, whose description was fully studied in Chapter
Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful
platforms to study Majorana bound states . We restrict ourselves to the
strictly one dimensional (single-mode) case for simplicity.
Generalisations to multimode nanowires are relatively straightforward.
The model Hamiltonian reads

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (98)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the momentum operator, @xmath is the effective electron
mass, @xmath the Rashba SOC strength, @xmath the Fermi energy and @xmath
the spin Pauli matrices. An external magnetic field @xmath along the
wire produces a Zeeman splitting @xmath , where @xmath is the Bohr
magneton and @xmath the wire @xmath -factor. The Rashba coupling defines
a typical length, the spin-orbit length @xmath , with the spin-orbit
energy defined as @xmath . For typical InSb values @xmath , with @xmath
the electron mass and @xmath eV Å, the spin-orbit energy is @xmath which
gives SO lengths of the order of @xmath nm.

Note that the Rashba and Zeeman fields in Eq. ( 98 ) are perpendicular.
As a result, the two spinful bands (shifted by SO) become mixed by the
Zeeman term and the zero-field crossing point at zero momentum becomes
an anticrossing of size @xmath . When the chemical potential lies within
this anti crossing gap, the system has two Fermi points, as opposed to
four Fermi points for @xmath above or below this gap. This window is a
helical gap, since the two fermi points correspond to counter
propagating states with different spins (the spin projection is locked
to momentum) [ 183 ] , see right panel in Fig. 51 .

### 20 The normal conductance

Before discussing the sub-gap Andreev spectrum of a NW coupled to
superconducting leads, we characterize the normal regime in the presence
of a Zeeman field. We are interested in particular in the normal
conductance @xmath as the Fermi energy ( @xmath ) in the middle section
of the NW (length @xmath ) varies with respect to the one in the left
and right leads @xmath . Such situation models a NW contacted between
normal electrodes and with a Fermi energy tuned by a central gate, see
e. g. Ref. [ 48 ] . For simplicity in the discussion, we model the
gate-induced electrostatic potential with an abrupt profile (the role of
smooth gate potentials has been recently discussed in Ref. [ 184 ] ).

For computations purposes we discretize Eq. ( 98 ) into a tight-binding
lattice. The momentum operator introduces hopping elements @xmath
between nearest-neighbor sites. The transparency of the left and right
contacts is parameterised by a factor @xmath , introduced in the hopping
matrix @xmath across the two interfaces, see Section 10.4 . @xmath is
calculated by means of the Greens function technique [ 185 , 186 ] ,

     @xmath      (99)
  -- -------- -- ------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (100)

is the full retarded Green’s function. The bare Green’s function of the
normal region without the presence of the leads is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (101)

The hamiltonian @xmath corresponds to @xmath in Eq. 98 with @xmath . The
leads are taken into account through the self-energies

where @xmath stands for the left/right lead’s propagator, when decoupled
from the system. In this case, @xmath corresponds to @xmath in Eq. ( 98
) with @xmath . Finally,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (103)
  -- -------- -- -------

In practice, @xmath is computed recursively with the boundary conditions
imposed by the leads.

To set the stage, we first consider an N-NW junction between a good
metal and a semi infinite nanowire, which will allow us to discuss
deviations when we consider confinement effects. Fig. 51 shows the
expected conductance profile as a function of the NW Fermi energy @xmath
, for different values @xmath of the Fermi energy in the metal. At
finite magnetic fields, the normal conductance exhibits a gap (with
@xmath ) of size @xmath . As we explained, this gap is a direct
consequence of the combined action of Zeeman effect and strong SO
coupling and reflects the presence of helical transport, namely
spin-polarized counter propagating states [ 183 ] . As discussed in Ref.
[ 184 ] , the visibility of this helical gap depends on various factors
which, importantly, include the actual value of the SO energy. Indeed,
as the ratio @xmath is made larger, the visibility of the gap in @xmath
is rapidly degraded (see lower curves in Fig. 51 ).

We now consider the confined N-NW-N junction geometry. Due to the
confinement of the central NW section, Fabry-Perot resonances are
expected. Fig. 52 shows the extreme case of a very short central region
with only one resonant quasibound state in the junction. As expected,
the conductance without external Zeeman field (solid curve) has a
Lorentzian shape and reaches its maximum value @xmath when @xmath
(vertical dashed guideline). Similar results are found for small Zeeman
fields @xmath (dashed). When @xmath , however, the leads becomes
spin-polarized (or helical, to be precise) and hence the maximum
conductance is halved to @xmath (red curve).

We consider first the situation with @xmath . This regime is
characterised by strong Fano dips that appear when @xmath is positive,
namely when the junction is gated to create a quantum dot instead of a
barrier, see Eq. ( 98 ). At these Fano dips destructive interference is
maximum and @xmath . Moreover, the position of these Fano resonances
moves to higher @xmath as @xmath increases (Fig. 52 , insets). The Fano
dips can be understood by noticing that the system develops a truly
bound state at an energy below @xmath as @xmath increases (Fig. 53 a).

While for @xmath this level lies far below the chemical potential of the
leads and cannot significantly affect @xmath , in the case @xmath at
hand, the situation is markedly different. At such high fields, one spin
sector in the leads is removed away from the chemical potential, and the
leads become helical. Similarly, the bound state below @xmath is
Zeeman-split, such that the component corresponding to the removed spin
sector may then cross the Fermi level at a given @xmath (Fig. 53 b-d).
This results in one spin projection strongly coupled to the continuum
(the sector that is not removed), while the other spin projection
remains weakly coupled to this helical continuum through the split bound
state (dashed circles), owing to the small spin canting induced by SO.
This configuration mimics the physics of a Fano resonance, as we
explicitly demonstrate in Appendix J with an effective model. Note that
SO is essential to mimic the physics of the Fano effect (two channels
with very different coupling to the continuum). Indeed, we have checked
that for @xmath (namely a fully spin-polarized system without canting)
the effect disappears (not shown). The general behaviour is related to
the so-called Fano-Rashba effect in systems with inhomogeneous Rashba
couplings [ 187 , 188 ] although in our case the bound states originate
from the Fermi energy inhomogeneity, which is probably more realistic
for NWs with gates. For intermediate lengths, the system can accommodate
many of the above resonances but the helical gap is not visible (not
shown).

Consider now the @xmath regime complementary to the preceding
discussion. In this situation, there exist two propagating channels in
the leads, and conductance may reach @xmath at Fabry-Perot maxima, as
long as the central NW is likewise non-helical ( @xmath ). Otherwise,
for long enough junctions ( @xmath for the realistic NW parameters in
our simulation) a helical gap develops in conductance, such that @xmath
. As central @xmath is tuned into and out of the helical regime,
conductance exhibits a reentrant behavior, switching from @xmath to
@xmath and back to @xmath . This reentrance can be resolved across
multiple resonant helical Fabry-Perot oscillations. This is illustrated
in Fig. 54 where we plot the conductance for a 4 @xmath -long nanowire
as a function of the central Fermi energy @xmath . Note the reentrant
conductance, and the helical Fabry-Perot resonances with an @xmath
ceiling, signalling helical transport in the junction. The visibility of
the conductance reentrance and the helical gap is lost for fields @xmath
, see bandstructure, right panel in Fig. 51 . At such fields, the
helical gap becomes an extended @xmath half-plateau (potentially with
superimposed Fano resonances if @xmath also exceeds @xmath ) that
emerges directly from pinch-off @xmath . Note that the regime with
helical Fano dips in the normal conductance is quite relevant towards
reaching topological superconductivity: the NW under the contacts can
become a non-trivial topological superconductor in the presence of
pairing as long as it can be depleted and made helical in the normal
phase. Hence our prediction of helical Fano dips superimposed on a
half-plateau of @xmath constitutes a strong signature of helical
behaviour as precursor of non-trivial superconductivity.

Similar phenomenology is obtained for conductance at fixed magnetic
fields and increasing @xmath (Fig. 55 ). As expected, the Fano dips
disappear as soon as @xmath while the gap coming from helicity in the
central section in the NW is much more robust. Increasing @xmath results
in well defined Fabry-Perot resonances in the helical gap region. The
normal conductance as a function of magnetic field is shown in Fig. 56 .
Here, a change from irregular behavior to regular @xmath oscillations as
a function of magnetic field signals the helical regime when @xmath [
184 ] .

Having in mind that there exists no conclusive experimental evidence of
the helical regime in nanowires in the literature [ 189 , 120 ] , the
nontrivial resonant effects in finite-length junctions that we have
described, both helical Fabry-Perot resonances and helical Fano dips,
could be used as an interesting option for detecting such helical
transport regime in long junctions. Even more significant, these helical
resonant features give rise to a non-trivial subgap spectrum when the
leads become superconducting, as we discuss in what follows.

### 21 Subgap levels in SNS junctions

In this section we investigate the role of the effects we have studied
in previous section on the sub-gap spectrum. First, we discuss how we
model a SNS junction and refer to Section 10.4 for more details. Then,
we make an important distinction of the different length scales of the
problem. At the end we present our results and point out the relevance
of our calculations towards experimental detection of Majorana bound
states.

#### 21.1 SNS junction model and relevant length scales

A full description for modeling finite length SNS nanowire junctions is
provided in Chapter Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire
junctions as useful platforms to study Majorana bound states . To model
a SNS junction we assume that the outer parts of the wire are coupled to
an s-wave superconductor (with bulk values @xmath and pairing @xmath ),
while the central is not (see Fig. 57 ). Superconducting correlations
are induced by proximity effect into the nanowire. For good enough
contact between the NW and the superconductor, the Cooper pair amplitude
is finite inside the NW regions below the superconductor. In most papers
in the literature, this situation is modeled by including by hand a
pairing term, @xmath , in the hamiltonian of such NW regions. While,
rigorously speaking, this is incorrect (the superconducting coupling
constant is zero inside the NW), it is well known that it provides a
good description of the proximity effect for large enough gaps (in such
cases, the parameter @xmath is essentially the low frequency limit of a
tunneling self-energy and is given by the tunnel coupling between the
normal and superconducting parts, see e.g. [ 173 ] ). Therefore, we
adopt this approximation here for simplicity (we have checked that all
our conclusions remain unaltered irrespective of whether we use this
simplified model or a full NW + SC coupling model, see appendix I ). In
cases where the interface transparencies are small, extra Fabry-Perot
resonances coming from insulating layers could complicate our analysis,
see Ref. [ 190 ] .

In particular, we model the regions of the nanowire below the
superconducting contacts as regions with Fermi energy @xmath and pairing
potential on the left (L) and right (R) contact given by @xmath and
@xmath , with @xmath . The region in the middle of the nanowire without
superconducting correlations is the normal region (N) with Fermi energy
denoted by @xmath as before. At high enough magnetic fields, the regions
of the NW below the superconductors (S regions of the junction) can be
driven into a topological superconducting phase when @xmath . Owing to
the finite length @xmath , this results in a SNS junction with four
Majorana bound states for a phase difference of @xmath between the
superconductors: two inner Majorana bound states, labeled @xmath , that
form inside the junction, and two outer Majorana bound states, @xmath ,
see Fig. 57 . On the other hand, for a zero phase difference, only the
outer MBSs are present.

SNS Josephson junctions are classified in two types, depending on the
relationship between the length of the normal region @xmath (i.e.
distance between the superconducting contacts) and the coherence length
@xmath , where @xmath is the Fermi velocity. Short junctions are
characterized by @xmath , whereas @xmath in long junctions. See Chapter
Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful
platforms to study Majorana bound states for additional details. Such
classification can be also given in terms of natural energy scales of
the problem, the Thouless energy, @xmath , and the induced
superconducting pairing potential @xmath , being @xmath the Fermi
velocity, and @xmath the length of the normal region. The above
conditions, in terms of these energy scales, are @xmath for short
junctions and @xmath for long ones. The significance of this
classification is related to the typical number @xmath of Andreev subgap
states of the junction, in addition to the MBSs at zero energy.

The MBSs wave functions decay from both ends of the topological
superconducting leads. The inner and outer MBSs may feel their mutual
presence if their wave functions exhibit a non zero spacial overlap. The
relevant decay distance characterizing this overlap is the Majorana
localization length @xmath (appendix K ). For finite @xmath the overlap
between MBSs is significant and therefore they are no longer true zero
modes.

In what follows, we discuss the subgap spectrum of short SNS junctions
in the topological regime @xmath as well as the subgap spectrum of long
SNS junctions as one goes from the helical junction regime to the
topological one. The helical junction regime is defined by a central
region depleted into the helical regime, while the S regions remain
non-topological, namely by @xmath , and @xmath .

#### 21.2 Short junctions

For very short junctions, the ABS spectrum at @xmath and @xmath does not
contain sub-gap states (Figs. 58 a and b). This is expected for a short
junction with @xmath . The @xmath spectrum (Figs. 58 c and d), on the
other hand, is much more interesting. It contains the expected subgap
state near zero energy for all @xmath (coming from the weakly coupled
outer Majoranas for @xmath , the inner MBS at @xmath are strongly
hybridized and form standard ABS at energy @xmath ). Notably, this MBS
coexists with a bound state that crosses zero energy for a given @xmath
(dashed line).

This bound state originates from the single resonance that the junction
accommodates for increasing @xmath (see Fig. 53 ), which we discussed in
connection to Fano resonances. If we interpret this resonant state as an
impurity level, our results for @xmath are consistent with Anderson’s
theorem which prevents the existence of bound states inside the gap of
an s-wave superconductor for non-magnetic impurities [ 60 ] . The reason
is that the zero-enery crossing appears for @xmath , such that the
superconductor is effectively p-wave. Therefore, the emergence of these
subgap states crossing zero energy should be understood as a direct
consequence of nontrivial topology in the junction [ 176 , 177 ] . The
precise condition for the level crossing coincides with the condition
for having a Fano dip. As we discussed in section 20 , this is the
condition in the normal regime for having a single resonant state which
interferes destructively with a helical contact; the latter condition is
here fulfilled because @xmath . These subgap states and zero-energy
crossings should be understood as the p-wave counterparts of so-called
Yu-Shiba-Rusinov sub-gap states [ 178 , 179 , 180 , 181 ] and their
corresponding parity crossings [ 182 ] in s-wave superconductors with
magnetic impurities.

Further insight comes from the magnetic field dependence at fixed @xmath
(Fig. 59 ), where we show three different situations: (top left) @xmath
, @xmath (top right) and @xmath (bottom). After the closing of the gap
across the topological phase transition at @xmath , the spectrum of the
junction exhibits a perfect zero-energy state (left and middle panels)
accompanied by a zero-energy crossing (dashed line in top left and right
panels) similar to the one discussed in Fig. 58 . On the other hand,
when @xmath , the zero energy states (outer Majorana bound states) are
not present anymore and a truly crossing at zero energy is observed.

Note here that despite the finite length of the central NW (in the top
right panel) the zero energy state for @xmath does not oscillate as a
function of Zeeman field, unlike what is typical of overlapping MBSs
(top left panel) [ 75 , 70 , 71 , 76 ] . This can be easily understood
as this state comes from the outer MBSs which at @xmath are effectively
decoupled across the junction, since we assume @xmath for the top right
panel.

We now analyse in more detail the full phase dependence in the
topological phase for different values of @xmath . The low-energy sector
is characteristic of a short junction: two almost @xmath -independent
levels near zero energy coming from outer MBSs and two dispersive levels
coming from hybridization of inner MBSs across the junction. The anti
crossings near @xmath are only visible for finite @xmath . For @xmath
(Fig. 60 a), the zero-energy levels are flat and the anti crossing at
@xmath becomes negligible ²⁵ ²⁵ 25 In @xmath limit, the outer Majoranas
are no longer involved in transport while the levels at @xmath exactly
cross (not shown) giving rise to anomalous @xmath -periodic spectrum and
Josephson currents if fermionic parity is conserved . In the following,
we refer to the dispersive ABS with almost perfect crossings at @xmath
as Majorana ABSs. As @xmath increases, an extra bound state emerges from
the continuum as an almost dispersionless subgap state and interacts
very weakly with the Majorana ABSs (Fig. 60 b). Importantly, after
crossing zero energy (Fig. 60 c) and reemerging at finite energy (Fig.
60 d), the anti crossing with the Majorana ABS is considerably larger,
indicating that the bound state has changed its parity character.

#### 21.3 Long junctions

The ABS spectrum of long junctions at small magnetic fields @xmath
differs considerably from the one of short junctions. Even for @xmath
(Fig. 61 a), the spectrum is very sensitive to the sharp increase of
conductance at small negative @xmath , when the junction goes rapidly
from pinch-off to fully transmitting (solid black line in Fig. 54 ).
This is reflected in a feature that resembles the closing and reopening
of a gap (but, of course, is related to the central region becoming
metallic, rather than with a gap closing). The emergence of Fabry-Perot
resonances in the normal phase is translated into the appearance of
level pairs at finite energies, or loops, that oscillate with system
parameters in the superconducting phase. A distinct change in the loop
structure takes place as @xmath is increased within a window @xmath .
This, recall, corresponds to the helical regime of the normal region,
characterised in normal transport by a helical gap and helical
Fabry-Perot oscillations. The loops inside said window reconnect, and
give rise to new loops around zero-energy, separated by parity crossings
(Fig. 61 b). Each of these crossings corresponds to a helical
Fabry-Perot resonance in the normal regime. For larger Zeeman energies,
supporting many helical Fabry-Perot resonances within the helical gap,
correspondingly many consecutive zero-energy loops become visible in the
superconducting regime. As soon as the normal side ceases to be helical
( @xmath ), the spectrum does no longer show loops around zero energy.
Since depleting the normal section of the NW junction should be much
easier than gating the proximized region, we expect that said near-zero
loops and parity crossings should be ubiquitous for finite size
junctions near depletion ²⁶ ²⁶ 26 Intermediate @xmath junctions also
show the same behaviour, not shown. and constitute yet another
alternative scheme to detect the helical regime.

Each loop in the helical regime (see e.g. Fig. 61 b) is similar to the
ones expected for magnetic impurities [ 178 , 179 , 180 , 181 ] , or
quantum dots in the Coulomb blockade regime [ 49 , 130 ] coupled to
superconductors (we emphasize here that our junction is noninteracting).
This result again suggests an interesting analogy with the physics of
Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states in superconductors with magnetic impurities.
Here, the combined action of Zeeman-induced spin-polarization and
depletion is crucial. Consecutive loops around zero energy, resemble the
oscillatory behavior expected from overlapping MBSs in finite length
NWs. However, since the helical gap condition @xmath does not involve
@xmath , which may be large, the zero-energy loops may exist while the
proximized S regions are still in the topologically trivial regime
@xmath (Fig. 61 c and d). Remarkably, there exists a profound connection
between zero-loops and MBSs. We find that the former actually evolve
continuously into outer MBSs as @xmath is increased beyond @xmath .

To illustrate this key idea, we compare in Fig. 62 , a situation without
near-zero energy loops at low B fields ( @xmath , panel a) with another
with loops at very low B coming from a helical normal region ( @xmath ,
panel b). While the MBSs in the first configuration emerge from a
situation without zero energy states/crossings at low fields, the ones
corresponding to the second configuration are clearly evolving from the
low B-field loops around zero energy. We emphasize here that both
configurations correspond to the same physical nanowire junction with
the sole difference of a depletion in the normal part of the junction in
the second case. Fig. 62 nicely illustrates two of our main results: 1)
long loops with parity crossings in the ABS spectrum can be used to
identify the helical regime in a Rashba NW and 2) such helical loops,
coming from depletion in the normal side of the junction, continuously
evolve into MBS for large enough magnetic fields.

To obtain more precise information about the nature of this interesting
connection between @xmath near-zero loops and MBS states, we study their
evolution for increasing SO coupling (Fig. 63 ). For @xmath (Fig. 63 a),
Zeeman-induced depairing closes the superconducting gap and the spectrum
becomes a dense quasi-continuum (the full junction is in the normal
regime), as expected. Any @xmath removes all finite energy crossings
while preserving the parity-protected crossings at zero energy. As a
result, the spectrum is still gapped after the first parity crossing
(the Zeeman field is no longer fully depairing) and many parity
crossings are possible. This important observation is illustrated in
Fig. 63 (b,c,d) (see also Fig. 62 b). For finite @xmath , the low-energy
spectrum remains gapped after the first crossing and also after
subsequent crossings.

Another interesting conclusion that we can draw from our results is that
a clear distinction between the near-zero states in the @xmath and
@xmath regions can no longer be made. The only difference is
quantitative, in that the amplitude of MBS oscillations in the
topological regime become smaller for increasing @xmath , unlike for
@xmath . (The SO length becomes much shorter and, hence @xmath ).
However, other spectral properties, such as the mini gap separating the
near-zero modes from the first excited states, is roughly the same in
both the trivial @xmath and non-trivial @xmath phases.

To finish, we consider the phase dependence of the subgap spectrum in
Fig. 64 . While topological SNS junctions with @xmath are @xmath
-periodic as a function of phase difference @xmath due to the
characteristic parity-protected crossing at @xmath (see e.g. Fig. 60 a),
in finite @xmath junctions (Fig. 64 a), said crossing is avoided, and
splits by a small energy due to the hybridization of MBSs at the
junction (inner) and MBSs at the far ends of each S region (outer),
which leads to a more conventional @xmath -periodicity [ 92 ] .
Interestingly, the subgap spectrum at @xmath (Fig. 64 b) shows
essentially the same phase-dependence, shown in bottom panels of Fig. 64
, which further confirms the deep connection between the @xmath and
@xmath parity crossings. Note that the resulting Josephson current [ 162
] , which only depends on the Andreev spectrum, would be effectively the
same (not shown).

### 22 Conclusions

We have studied the normal transport and the sub-gap spectrum of SNS
junctions based on semiconducting nanowires with strong Rashba
spin-orbit coupling. In particular, we have focused on the role of
confinement effects in ballistic finite-length junctions and analyzed
the distinct properties of the ABS for short and long junctions as
different sections of the underlying NW (N or S or both) become helical.
For @xmath , confined levels in the normal section give rise to bound
subgap states, as expected from the effective p-wave nature of the
topological superconductor. In normal transport, such bound states give
rise to helical Fano dips. Perhaps more strikingly, we have found that a
long junction with a helical normal section, but still in the
topologically trivial regime with @xmath , supports a low-energy subgap
spectrum consisting of multiple-loop structures and parity crossings.
Such states are derived from helical Fabry-Perot resonances in the
normal regime. We have argued that such multiple loop structure in the
ABS spectrum could be used to unambiguously identify the helical regime
in NWs. Interestingly, these multiple loops smoothly evolve towards
Majorana bound states as the Zeeman field exceeds the critical value.
This suggests an interesting connection between subgap parity crossings
in helical junctions with @xmath and Majorana bound states in
topological ones with @xmath . A recent study of fully open
helical-N/trivial-S contacts [ 140 ] further confirms the profound
connection between subgap states in the helical regime and Majorana
physics.

## Chapter \thechapter Majorana bound states from exceptional points in
non-topological superconductors272727This Chapter is part of a work
published in [140]

Recent experimental efforts towards the detection of Majorana bound
states have focused on creating the conditions for topological
superconductivity. Here we demonstrate an alternative route, which
achieves fully localised zero-energy Majorana bound states when a
topologically trivial superconductor is strongly coupled to a helical
normal region. Such a junction can be experimentally realised by e.g.
proximitizing a finite section of a nanowire with spin-orbit coupling,
and combining electrostatic depletion and a Zeeman field to drive the
non-proximitized (normal) portion into a helical phase. Majorana zero
modes emerge in such an open system without fine-tuning as a result of
charge-conjugation symmetry, and can be ultimately linked to the
existence of ‘exceptional points’ (EPs) in parameter space, where two
quasibound Andreev levels bifurcate into two quasibound Majorana zero
modes. After the EP, one of the latter becomes non-decaying as the
junction approaches perfect Andreev reflection, thus resulting in a
Majorana dark state (MDS) localised at the NS junction. We show that
MDSs exhibit the properties associated to conventional closed-system
Majorana bound states, while not requiring topological
superconductivity.

### 23 Introduction

The emergence of topologically protected Majorana zero modes in
topological superconductors has recently entered the spotlight of
condensed matter research [ 51 , 164 , 29 , 52 , 53 ] One of the main
reasons is the remarkable prediction that such Majorana bound states
(MBSs), also known as Majorana zero modes, should obey non-Abelian
braiding statistics [ 86 , 149 ] , much like the 5/2 states in the
fractional Hall effect, without requiring many-body correlations. It has
been argued that the successful generation, detection and manipulation
of MBSs would open the possibility of practical topologically protected
quantum computation [ 85 , 191 ] . Despite impressive experimental
progress [ 67 , 128 , 46 , 90 , 47 , 48 , 49 , 192 , 193 , 123 ] , such
ambitious goals have still not been conclusively achieved.

A number of practical proposals have been put forward aiming to generate
the conditions for the spontaneous emergence of robust MBSs in real
devices. Some of the most studied ones are based on proximitising
topological insulators [ 37 ] or semiconductor nanowires [ 61 , 150 ] .
The core challenge in all these proposals has been to artificially
synthesise a topologically non-trivial superconductor with a
well-defined and robust topological gap [ 100 ] . The bulk-boundary
correspondence principle dictates that the superconductor surface is
then host to topologically protected MBSs. Creating a topological gap is
arguably the main practical difficulty of such proposals, particularly
since topological superconductors are rather sensitive to disorder.

In this Chapter we present an alternative scheme for the creation of
MBSs that does not require topological superconductivity at all. The
possibility of engineering Majoranas in topologically trivial setups has
been studied in other contexts before. It has been shown, for example,
that topological excitations, and MBSs in particular, may arise in
trivial superconductors under adequate external driving [ 88 , 194 ] ,
similarly to the mechanism behind Floquet topological insulators [ 195 ]
. Also, cold-atom systems with specifically engineered dissipation [ 196
, 197 ] may relax into a topologically non-trivial steady state that are
host to dark states at zero energy with Majorana properties. Our
approach is implemented in a solid state setup and is based on
proximitized semiconductor nanowires. In its topologically trivial
regime, such a wire will not generate MBSs when terminated with vacuum
(i.e. at a closed boundary). Its spectrum is instead a set of Bogoliubov
quasiparticles that can be seen as pairs of Majoranas hybridized to
finite energy. By creating a sufficiently transparent
normal-superconductor (NS) junction at one end of the wire, we create a
different kind of open boundary, to which the bulk-boundary
correspondence principle does not apply. Such a high-transparency
junction can be fabricated by proximitizing only one half of a pristine
semiconducting nanowire (Fig. 67 ). We demonstrate that, as one tunes
the normal side into a helical (half-metallic) regime via a parallel
Zeeman field, one Majorana pair becomes decoupled into two zero energy
resonances. One of which is subsequently removed into the reservoir,
leaving behind a stable Majorana ‘dark state’ (MDS) at the NS junction
without requiring a non-trivial superconductivity. A dark state here is
defined as a bound state that despite having an energy embedded in a
continuum of delocalized excitations is orthogonal to them and,
therefore, non-decaying.

#### 23.1 General considerations on NS junctions

The emergence of these MDSs cannot be described using the conventional
band topology language, but rather needs to be understood in the context
of open quantum systems. Unlike in closed systems, eigenstates in open
systems decay with time, as the state leaks into the reservoir. Hence,
their energies are no longer real but have a negative imaginary part
@xmath , @xmath . Such a complex spectrum is sometimes modelled by a
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. A more precise and general description is
obtained by considering the analytic continuation of the scattering
matrix @xmath , where the energy @xmath of incoming states from the
reservoir is allowed to extend into the lower complex half-plane. The
analogous to the real eigenvalues of the closed system then becomes the
poles of @xmath for the open system.

Scattering processes at the NS interface in the stationary regime are
determined by the scattering matrix ( @xmath -matrix), whose general
form is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (104)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that describes
this open system , @xmath is the coupling matrix to the normal reservoir
N and @xmath the isolated system’s time-independent Hermitian
Hamiltonian.

As an example we consider a minimal description that consists of a
low-energy energy BdG parity crossing, a pair of Andreev levels near
zero-energy crossing as the ones discussed in Chap. Hybrid
superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful platforms to
study Majorana bound states (see for instance Fig. 65 ) and then we
analyse its properties in an open NS system, when coupled to a single
pair of electron-hole modes in the normal reservoir N. Here, we follow
the discussion made in [ 198 ] . The low-energy problem restricts the
dimension of matrices @xmath and @xmath to be @xmath . Therefore, they
can be in general written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (105)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the entries are in general complex numbers. Since we are dealing
with a superconducting system, electron-hole symmetry requires @xmath
and @xmath [ 54 ] . Thus, taking into account Hermicity of @xmath , and
electron-hole symmetry, we arrive at

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (106)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath are defined from the eigenvalues of the coupling matrix
@xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (107)
  -- -------- -- -------

and @xmath being real coefficients. Therefore, the effective Hamiltonian
can be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (108)
  -- -------- -- -------

In order to understand the meaning of @xmath , we write down the
effective Hamiltonian in the Majorana representation, which is defined
by the following rotation matrix @xmath [ 54 ] ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (109)
  -- -------- -- -------

In this basis, the rotation of the effective Hamiltonian, @xmath , is
written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (110)
  -- -------- -- -------

and exhibits a clear physical meaning. Indeed, note that in Eq. ( 110 )
each Majorana contributing to a BdG excitation may have a different
lifetime @xmath , where @xmath represents the Majorana overlap.

Further information is acquired from analysing the poles of the @xmath
-matrix given by Eq. ( 104 ). Such poles are the eigenvalues of the
effective Hamiltonian @xmath . Then, from Eq. ( 108 ), we get the
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions

  -- -- -- -------
           (111)
  -- -- -- -------

The NS junction is now an open system with quasi bound Andreev states
that acquire a finite imaginary part, which gives rise to a finite
lifetime.

The discussion made before can be generalised to a multichannel case [
198 ] , and therefore we can conclude that in NS junctions, all such
poles come in pairs @xmath for all poles with non-zero real part @xmath
, due to the charge-conjugation symmetry of the Nambu representation [
199 , 200 ] . Here, we denote the real part as @xmath , while @xmath as
the imaginary part of eigenvalues given in Eq. ( 111 ). In this sense,
poles with zero real part @xmath are special, as they do not come in
pairs. We denote their total number by @xmath , which excludes any pole
with zero real and imaginary part.

From Eq. ( 111 ), one notices that for @xmath , there are two kind of
poles in the low complex plane with standard BdG degeneracy @xmath (see
Fig. 66 a). As a given parameter of the system is varied, a pair of
poles @xmath first approach each other (see Fig. 66 a) and then become
degenerate at the imaginary axis when @xmath (see Fig. 66 b), being the
real part of the eigenvalues is zero, @xmath . The S-matrix has a single
degenerate pole and the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the effective
Hamiltonian, which are poles of the S-matrix, have the special form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (112)
  -- -------- -- -------

The fusion of the two poles of the @xmath -matrix is known as a pole
transition , which is a particular instance of a more general phenomenon
in open quantum systems and known as exceptional point (EP) [ 201 , 202
, 203 , 204 , 205 ] . It differs from a closed-system degeneracy in that
the corresponding eigenstates do not remain orthogonal, but rather
coalesce into one as they pass through a branch point singularity, as
one can indeed check from Eq. ( 112 ),

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (113)
  -- -------- -- -------

It turns out that this phenomenon is very well known in the open quantum
systems, where complex eigenvalues and eigenfunctions coalesce at an
exceptional point in the spectrum owing to branch point singularities.
Indeed, exceptional points have been extensively studied in photonics
where they have been shown to give rise to novel phenomena unique to
open systems [ 206 , 207 , 208 , 209 , 210 , 211 , 212 , 213 ] . Their
implications in electronic systems, however, have been seldom discussed
[ 214 , 215 ] .

After the exceptional point, in our example for @xmath (see Fig. 66 c),
the @xmath -matrix has two purely imaginary poles

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (114)
  -- -------- -- -------

representing two modes with zero real energy but with different
lifetime, which arises from the imaginary part. The two degenerate poles
branch along the imaginary axis and their decay rates bifurcate into
different values as one can indeed observe in previous equation. A
maximum width bifurcation is reached when @xmath (see Fig. 66 d), that
is at the parity crossing (see red circle in Fig. 65 ), then the
eigenvalues read

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (115)
  -- -------- -- -------

Observe that they acquire different lifetime which depends on the
couplings to the reservoir N, @xmath , as they are eigenvalues of the
coupling matrix @xmath .

The total number @xmath (which excludes any pole with zero real and
imaginary part) has a very important meaning in open NS junctions, and
defines the analogue of band topology of a closed quantum system.
Indeed, it has been shown that the topology of the scattering matrix in
quasi-1D NS junctions is classified by the invariant @xmath , i.e. the
parity of the number of poles with zero real energy, with @xmath
signalling an open system with non-trivial topology from the point of
view of scattering [ 199 , 200 ] . In terms of its S-matrix poles, the
topological transitions of an open NS junction follow a characteristic
pattern. At the beginning, @xmath , since there are no poles with zero
real energy, and the S-matrix is trivial, @xmath . The EP transition
discussed above is the open-system counterpart of a band inversion in a
closed system [ 199 , 200 ] . We have seen that after the exceptional
point, the @xmath -matrix has two purely imaginary poles and their decay
rates bifurcates into different values denoted now by @xmath . The
exceptional point thus involves a change of @xmath by 2, but the
topology of the @xmath -matrix remains trivial, @xmath . If @xmath
evolves towards zero (or close enough to zero for all practical
purposes), it is said that the corresponding pole is buried , and it is
excluded from the @xmath count, effectively signalling a change of
topology @xmath . Crucially, the existence of a buried pole implies the
existence of a zero-energy non-decaying (dark) state somewhere in the
system with Majorana properties. In this sense, S-matrix topology is a
true generalization of the band-structure topology of closed systems,
and has the same implications in terms of topologically protected
excitations, albeit in the context of open systems. It is also closely
linked to the existence of an exceptional point in the system that
occurs before the pole burying, in the trivial @xmath phase.

In this Chapter we show that, while at weak couplings between the normal
environment and the superconductor a non-trivial S-matrix implies that
the superconductor is also non-trivial in isolation, this is not the
case at strong couplings. In specific but experimentally relevant
conditions, a sufficiently transparent junction between a normal metal
and a trivial superconductor has a non-trivial S-matrix with @xmath ,
and is thus host to a Majorana dark state. The required conditions are:
(1) the system should have a finite spin-orbit coupling at the contact,
(2) the normal part of the junction should be sufficiently depleted
(small Fermi energy @xmath ) and polarised by a Zeeman field @xmath into
a helical half-metallic phase @xmath , (3) the normal transmission of
the junction should be close to one, and (4) the trivial superconductor
should be in the Andreev limit @xmath , where @xmath is the
superconducting gap and @xmath is its Fermi energy. The rationale of
these conditions is to achieve good Andreev reflection of helical
carriers from the normal side, which generates a MDS strongly localized
at the junction.

The intuitive mechanism behind the process is as follows. When isolated,
the trivial superconducting wire is host to a Majorana pair at each end,
which is strongly hybridized into a fermionic Bogoliubov state, with
real energies @xmath . As the contact is opened onto a helical wire
(which has a single decay channel), one (and only one) of the two
Majoranas escapes into the reservoir (blue state in Fig. 67 ), leaving
behind the orthogonal Majorana as a dark state (red), pinned at zero
energy since it no longer overlaps with the escaped Majorana. This
process takes place formally by crossing an exceptional point
bifurcation of the @xmath poles into poles @xmath on the imaginary axis.
As the conditions above are fulfilled, the zero energy dark state
becomes truly non-decaying @xmath . Deviations from these conditions
result in a residual decay rate @xmath . The dark state is then a sharp
Majorana resonance centered at zero, but with Majorana properties
surviving at times shorter than @xmath . We consider a realistic model
of an NS contact in a proximitized semiconducting wire. We show that the
residual decay rate of the MDS in non-ideal conditions depend
exponentially with junction lengthscales, just like the Majorana
splitting in closed topological superconductors.

### 24 Majorana dark states in a proximitized Rashba wire

In Chapter Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as
useful platforms to study Majorana bound states we have discussed that
in recent years experimental progress has been reported towards the
detection of MBS in Rashba nanowires [ 67 , 128 , 46 , 90 , 47 , 48 ,
216 ] . These efforts were in large part stimulated by the prediction by
Lutchyn et al. [ 61 ] and Oreg et al. [ 150 ] that these type of systems
would undergo a topological transition into an effective p-wave
superconducting phase when a Zeeman field @xmath parallel to the wire
exceeds a critical value @xmath . See Chap. Hybrid
superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful platforms to
study Majorana bound states for a full description about engineering 1D
topological superconductors based on nanowires with Rashba spin-orbit
coupling. We now consider models relevant to single-mode Rashba wires,
and demonstrate the formation of MDSs for @xmath .

Following Refs. [ 61 , 150 ] , we model a thin proximitized Rashba
nanowire under a Zeeman field by a spinful 1D tight-binding chain,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (116)
  -- -------- -- -------

Notice that previous Hamiltonian is the same given by Eq. ( 79 ) in
Chap. Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful
platforms to study Majorana bound states . The parameters of the model
are the chemical potential measured from depletion @xmath , the hopping
@xmath , where @xmath is the effective mass and @xmath is the lattice
spacing, the induced pairing @xmath , the SO hopping @xmath , where
@xmath is the SO coupling and @xmath is the SO length, and the Zeeman
field @xmath , where @xmath is the g-factor, and @xmath is the magnetic
field along the wire. In what follows we present simulations with
parameters corresponding to an InSb proximitized wire [ 67 ] ( @xmath
meV, @xmath meV nm, @xmath , @xmath ). We will consider both an isolated
proximitized wire of finite length, and an open NS contact between
proximitized and non-proximitized sections of a nanowire, Fig. 67 . The
latter is assumed infinite (see the supplemental information for finite
length effects), and is modelled by the same Hamiltonian, albeit with
@xmath and a @xmath in place of @xmath . The normal-state average
transparency per mode @xmath of the contact is physically controlled by
a electrostatic gating in an actual device, and is modelled here either
by a hopping @xmath across the contact, or by a spatial interpolation
between @xmath and @xmath across a certain contact length @xmath
determined by the distance of the wire to the depletion gate ( @xmath is
always abrupt, see Supplementary Material). Note that if the density of
defects in the wire is small, @xmath , with @xmath a lengthscale of the
order of the average Fermi wavelength.

Topologically, the isolated nanowire belongs, for finite @xmath , to the
same one-dimensional D-class as the multimode Kitaev wire. For @xmath
smaller than a critical @xmath , the nanowire is trivial ( @xmath ). As
@xmath exceeds @xmath , the topological invariant becomes non-trivial (
@xmath ) through a band inversion, see Fig. 68 a, with the peculiarity
that the two hybridized Majoranas in the trivial @xmath phase are not
deep inside the gap, but at the band edge. As @xmath grows, @xmath
quickly becomes unrealistically large, and the nanowire remains trivial
for all reasonable fields, Fig. 68 b. (A large @xmath , incidentally, is
the natural experimental regime, since the superconductor will typically
transfer charge to the proximitized section of the wire that is
difficult to deplete due to screening.)

The nanowire contains a non-proximitized normal section, Fig. 67 , and
we define the effective Hamiltonian as @xmath , with the exact self
energy from the normal portion of the wire evaluated at zero frequency
@xmath (see Appendix Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire
junctions as useful platforms to study Majorana bound states ). As the
coupling to the reservoirs increases (the junction transparency @xmath
grows), two eigenvalues drop out from the band edge into the lower
complex plane, and merge at the imaginary axis at an exceptional point.
This exceptional point is only reached if the Zeeman field exceeds a
certain value @xmath , see dashed lines in 68 (c,d). This @xmath is the
field required for the normal nanowire to become helical . For @xmath ,
the normal nanowire hosts a single propagating mode, with the other spin
sector completely depleted by the Zeeman field, and behaves as a
single-mode reservoir like the one discussed for the Kitaev wire in [
140 ] . Note that this helical regime should be achievable using
electrostatic gating, since it only requires a sufficient depletion of
the non-proximitized section of the semiconductor nanowire, unscreened
by the superconductor.

After crossing the exceptional point (region above thick black curves in
68 [c,d]), the scattering matrix @xmath at the trivial NS contact
acquires @xmath purely imaginary poles. One of the two moves towards the
origin. The asymptotic decay rate @xmath in the limit @xmath is not
vanishing in general, so that the corresponding states should be denoted
as Majorana resonances [ 217 ] . However, in the experimentally relevant
Andreev limit @xmath , Fig. 68 d, the asymptotic @xmath vanishes
exponentially with @xmath (see inset). When the wire is tuned into the
regime @xmath and the contact is made sufficiently transparent, the
Majorana resonances are stabilised into proper non-decaying MDSs. For
example, for the realistic parameters of the simulations in Fig. 68 d
the lifetime for the minimum widths (see inset) corresponds to @xmath
0.2 microseconds. While this is already a rather long time, this is not
an upper bound since even longer lifetimes can in principle be obtained
by increasing @xmath .

The interpretation of this mechanism is as follows. While two MBSs at
opposite ends of an isolated topological nanowire can be considered
exact zero modes up to exponentially small corrections (in the wire
length) coming from their mutual overlap, an MDSs (red in Fig. 67 ) also
becomes an exact Majorana zero mode without any fine tuning by a
suppression of its overlap with its sibling Majorana (blue in Fig. 67 ),
which escapes into the helical reservoir. It is important to note that,
in contrast to isolated topological wires, any residual overlap that
remains after the exceptional point does not translate into a finite
energy splitting, but rather into a residual decay rate @xmath .

### 25 Physical properties of Majorana dark states

Having established the emergence of zero energy dark states at a
transparent helical metal-trivial superconductor junction in the Andreev
limit, we now turn to the analysis of the physical properties of said
states, and compare them to conventional MBSs. We will study their
signatures in transport, their wavefunction locality, particle-hole
conjugation, their charge neutrality, uniform charge oscillations and
finally and the low energy spectrum properties in SNS geometries.

#### Signatures in dI/dV

We start by analysing the differential conductance @xmath through a
normal tunnelling probe weakly coupled to the neighbourhood of the
junction, brown in Fig. 67 . In the tunneling limit, this is
proportional to the local density of states at the junction at energy
@xmath , where @xmath is the bias voltage. (Note that this is different
from the differential conductance across the NS contact, which is not
necessarily in the tunnelling regime, see below). We computed the
tunnelling @xmath versus @xmath and @xmath using standard quantum
transport techniques [ 218 ] (see Appendix Hybrid
superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful platforms to
study Majorana bound states ), and we present the results in Fig. 69
(a-f) for several transparencies @xmath , both far from the Andreev
limit (top row), and deep into the Andreev limit (bottom row). Atop each
panel, the evolution of the lowest complex eigenvalues with @xmath is
shown, with an exceptional point bifurcation at @xmath . Panel (a)
corresponds to the tunnelling limit @xmath , which exhibits a sharp peak
at zero-energy due to conventional MBSs for @xmath , and slightly split
in two due to their hybridization across @xmath . As @xmath is
increased, panels (b,c), the @xmath zero-energy peak in the LDOS is
washed away, since the Majorana at the contact becomes a finite-lifetime
Majorana resonance, increasingly delocalized into the reservoir.
Interestingly, however, as @xmath is increased the onset of the Majorana
resonance is shifted to fields @xmath , for which the band topology of
the superconducting nanowire is trivial. The Majorana resonance emerges
upon crossing an exceptional point at a certain @xmath (see bifurcation
in Fig. 69 (b,c) [top plots]. As @xmath is increased from 0 to 1, @xmath
decreases from @xmath (solid guidelines) to @xmath (dashed). @xmath is
the field for which the N side of the junction becomes helical (spin
becomes locked to the value of momentum), as is characterised by the
loss of one propagating channel.

Two important conclusions can be drawn from these results. On the one
hand, we see that in the particular @xmath regime, @xmath limit, the
topological transition and the exceptional point coincide @xmath . [ 200
] For wires sufficiently open to reservoirs, however, the exceptional
point and its associated Majorana resonance will occur at lower fields
(around @xmath ) than the topological crossover, or pole burying (at
@xmath ), and might therefore be easier to reach experimentally.
Secondly, the difference between a Majorana resonance at @xmath and a
conventional @xmath MBSs in finite wires seems to be merely qualitative,
i.e. differing simply in their lifetime, since both correspond to the
same pole of the scattering matrix at different positions in the complex
plane. Conventional MBSs above @xmath have a finite (real) energy
splitting due to the finite length, while Majorana resonances below
@xmath have a finite width @xmath . However, while the former can be
decreased by increasing the length of the proximitised wire (making the
MBSs effectively eigenstates), the inverse lifetime @xmath of Majorana
resonances is always sizeable in the present regime ( @xmath ); it
decreases with Zeeman field, and exhibits a kink for high @xmath at the
helical transition @xmath of the normal side (see top panel of Fig. 69
c, where the imaginary part of the poles develops a kink at @xmath ),
but it remains relatively large all the way till @xmath . Next, we will
show that in the experimentally relevant regime @xmath this is no longer
the case. The kink at @xmath evolves, at high @xmath , into an S-matrix
topological crossover far below @xmath , which gives rise to the
formation of a new type of exceptional MBSs localised at the junction,
with @xmath .

So far, we have shown that Majorana resonances for @xmath evolve
continuously into conventional MBSs as @xmath crosses @xmath . A natural
question arises as to why a zero-energy Majorana resonance may appear in
a topologically trivial wire in the first place. This may be intuitively
understood by considering that a topologically trivial @xmath isolated
nanowire actually hosts a pair of MBSs pairs at each end (one for each
of two opposite p-wave sectors in the trivial wire [ 51 ] ), that are
strongly hybridized away from zero energy to an energy close to @xmath ,
due to their large overlap. However, when one end is fully opened into a
helical wire with a single propagating mode ( @xmath ), one (and only
one) of the two MBSs escapes into the reservoir, and decouples from the
other MBS, which remains well localized at the contact and returns to
zero energy. This mechanism does not apply for @xmath since in this case
both MBSs may immediately escape into the reservoir. The origin of the
finite lifetime of a Majorana resonance is connected to the probability
for one of the two hybridized Majoranas to completely escape into the
helical wire and out into the reservoir. The higher this probability,
the longer-lived the remaining Majorana will be, since its overlap with
its delocalised sibling will be suppressed. For perfect escape
probability, the Majorana becomes a zero-energy, non-decaying dark state
at the junction. One might guess that this escape probability should be
@xmath itself, but we showed in Fig. 69 (a,b,c) that a @xmath contact
with @xmath has a Majorana resonance of finite lifetime. The reason is
that a perfect normal transparency @xmath only implies escape
probability one across the NS junction in the limit in which the induced
pairing @xmath is a small perturbation respect to the normal phase, i.e.
in the Andreev limit @xmath . This is, incidentally, the realistic
regime of experimental samples, since electrostatically depleting a
proximitised wire to have @xmath is much more difficult than depleting
an exposed section, whose @xmath can typically be tuned all the way to
zero by a gate.

To demonstrate this scenario, we show in Fig. 69 (d,e,f) the LDOS and
pole evolution of the NS junction in the Andreev limit, @xmath . This
moves the topological crossover @xmath to higher fields ( @xmath T, up
from @xmath T), while the helical field @xmath (dashed guideline)
remains the same. The range of physical @xmath fields is the same as in
the top row of Fig. 69 , but now @xmath falls outside of this range. As
@xmath is increased (by making the spatial transition between @xmath and
@xmath at the contact smooth [ 184 ] ), the width of the Majorana
resonance becomes greatly reduced, i.e. the resonance becomes gradually
decoupled from the reservoir. Note the similarity between the sharp zero
energy peak in the LDOS emerging in Fig. 69 f for @xmath and the one in
Fig. 69 a for @xmath . The width of the latter, a conventional MBSs
associated to a topologically non-trivial superconducting bulk, vanishes
as @xmath . The width of the former, in contrast, vanishes as @xmath and
@xmath is increased. This is demonstrated in the inset of Fig. 68 d,
which shows @xmath at the helical transition @xmath for @xmath as a
function of @xmath . We see that @xmath is quickly suppressed as soon as
we approach the Andreev limit @xmath , and becomes arbitrarily small as
@xmath grows. This supports the intuitive picture of the preceding
paragraphs.

Panel (f), with @xmath , corresponds to a cut along the top of Fig. 68
(d), for which MDSs are fully developed. Their presence gives rise to
sharp zero bias anomaly (ZBA) in transport at fields @xmath , with a
sharpness that increases exponentially with @xmath . This type of ZBA
was the first signature of MBSs explored experimentally [ 67 ] , though
in the present context they arise far from the topological regime @xmath
. The ZBA is not preceded by signatures of a gap closing. Note also that
away from the ideal conditions @xmath , @xmath , wide Majorana
resonances are also visible in the topologically trivial regime, panels
(b,c,e), albeit of finite lifetime. Exceptional MBSs are therefore
zero-energy dark state that arise at a sufficiently transparent junction
between a conventional superconductor and a metal with a single
propagating helical channel. By the S-matrix definition, such junction
becomes effectively non-trivial topologically, while by the band
topology definition, both normal and superconducting bulks remain
trivial. In spite of the system being arbitrarily far from a band
topological transition, the more general S-matrix point of view shows
that the zero energy state associated to the buried pole is a genuine
MBS. In contrast to a @xmath MBS, the exceptional MBS is located at the
junction (red sphere in Fig. 67 ), and its residual energy scale can be
tuned all the way to zero by increasing @xmath instead of @xmath . In
the following we will demonstrate its Majorana character, and analyse
its associated phenomenology.

#### Spatial localization and Majorana character

The spatial locality and Majorana self-conjugation @xmath are assessed
next, by analysing the wavefunction of the MDSs. Figure 70 shows, in
red, the quasiparticle density @xmath (solid lines) and charge density
@xmath (dashed lines) of the MDS marked by the white arrow in Fig 69 f (
@xmath and @xmath are particle and hole components of its wavefunction,
respectively). As discussed above, the MDS represents a non-decaying
state at zero energy. The figure shows that it is furthermore well
localised at the junction, decaying exponentially as @xmath with a
Majorana localization length @xmath [ 219 ] into the superconductor (see
envelopes and inset in 70 ). For comparison we also show in black the
spatial probability @xmath of a conventional @xmath MBS for a
topological bulk at zero transparency (isolated topological wire). For
both states, the charge density @xmath is zero, as implied by the
Majorana relation @xmath .

We now examine the charge density patterns that arise from the weak
overlap of two MDSs. It was shown [ 220 , 221 ] that the charge density
@xmath , which is zero everywhere for an isolated MBS (see Fig. 70 ),
develops a spatial oscillatory pattern that is uniform throughout space
when two MBSs approach each other in a 1D superconductor, irrespective
of their particular positions. This is a very specific and non-trivial
signature of MBSs that probes the state wavefunction itself, and was
proposed as a way to detect MBSs through charge sensing. A transparent
NSN junction (with N portions coupled to reservoirs) provides a
convenient geometry to study this effect in the topologically trivial
regime. Two localized MDSs appear for @xmath at the two ends of the S
section. They weakly overlap, and should thus be expected to exhibit
uniform spatial charge oscillation throughout the superconductor in
analogy to conventional MBSs. Figs. 71 compare the charge density @xmath
for @xmath MBSs in the tunnelling limit and @xmath in the transparent
limit. Once more, we see the strong similarity between the two cases,
which points to an essential equivalence between the two types of
states.

#### 25.1 Low-energy phase dependence

In Fig. 72 we present the low-energy phase dependence in a topological
(left) and non-topological (right) four-Majorana Josephson junction.
MBSs at the outer (non-contacted) ends of the wire will form a zero
energy fermion for long enough wires (in red), while the inner MBSs (the
ancilla pair, in blue) will form a fermion with @xmath -dependent
energy. The ancilla Majoranas in this situation correspond to the two
Majoranas delocalised over the helical region (blue in Fig. 72 , while
the outer Majoranas are the MDSs localised at each contact (red).
Regardless of their different positions in space, the low energy Andreev
spectrum in this system is essentially the same as for a four-MBS
topological Josephson junction [ 139 ] (compare left and right panels in
Fig. 72 ).

### 26 Conclusions

We have presented a novel approach to engineer Majorana bound states in
non-topological superconducting wires. Instead of inducing a topological
transition in a proximitized Rashba wire, we consider a sufficiently
transparent normal-superconductor junction created on a Rashba wire,
with a topologically trivial superconducting side and a helical normal
side. The strong coupling to the helical environment forces a single
long-lived resonance to emerge from an exceptional point at precisely
zero energy above a threshold transparency. This resonance evolves as
the transparency is increased further into a stable dark state localised
at the junction. We have demonstrated this phenomenon in a realistic
model for a proximitized semiconducting nanowire.

The zero-energy state emerges as the junction traverses an exceptional
point at the threshold transparency, and becomes robustly pinned to zero
energy without fine tuning by virtue of charge-conjugation symmetry.
Moreover, its residual decay rate at perfect transparency is
exponentially suppressed in the experimentally relevant Andreev limit.
Finally, we have shown that relevant transport and spectral properties
associated to these zero energy states, here dubbed Majorana dark
states, are indistinguishable from those of conventional Majorana bound
states.

Thus, our proposal offers a new promising strategy towards generating
and detecting Majorana bound states in the lab, with potential
advantages over more conventional approaches in situations where
manipulating the metallic environment and contact properties proves to
be simpler than engineering a topological superconducting transition.
Most importantly, the condition for reaching a helical phase in the
normal side, while the proximitized region of the nanowire remains in
the large @xmath Andreev limit, is expected to be accessible
experimentally. All the necessary ingredients for our proposal are
already available in the lab: dramatic advances in fabrication of thin
semiconducting nanowires, proximitized with conventional s-wave
superconductors, were recently reported [ 113 , 115 ] . Highly
transparent, single-channel, NS contacts and a high-quality proximity
effect in quantitative agreement with theory were demonstrated. Reaching
the helical regime in such high-quality and fully tunable devices should
be within reach, so we expect that our proposal for MDSs will be soon
tested.

The general connection demonstrated here between Majorana states and the
bifurcation of zero energy complex eigenvalues at exceptional points in
open systems offers a new perspective on the mechanisms that may give
rise to Majorana states in condensed matter systems. In this sense it
extends conventional strategies based on topological superconductors. It
moreover expands on the extensive studies on exceptional point physics
in optics, where it has been shown that state coalescence has
far-reaching physical consequences, such as e.g. non-Abelian geometric
phases [ 222 , 223 , 224 ] . To date, most studies of this kind have
been concerned with open photonic systems under parity-time (PT)
symmetry [ 206 , 207 , 208 ] and with its spontaneous breakdown through
exceptional point bifurcations. This leads to intriguing physical
phenomena, such as unidirectional transmission or reflection [ 208 ] ,
loss-induced transparency [ 209 ] , lasers with reversed pump dependence
and other exotic properties [ 210 , 211 , 212 ] . Such striking optical
phenomena are seemingly unrelated to the physics described in this work,
but interesting connections are being made. These include open photonic
systems with charge-conjugation symmetry [ 215 ] (as opposed to PT
symmetry), and which show spectral transitions analogous to the zero
mode bifurcation discussed here. Also, radiation-induced non-hermicity
has been demonstrated as a way to convert Dirac cones into exceptional
points [ 225 ] , a phenomenon completely analogous to the conversion of
zero energy crossings of Bogoliubov-de Gennes excitations in Josephson
junctions into double exceptional point structures. Further research
should extend the understanding of these interesting connections. More
importantly, our study and others [ 215 , 225 ] raise relevant
questions, such as whether there is a deeper connection between
topological transitions in closed systems and spectral bifurcations in
non-hermitian systems. Answering such questions would help in advancing
our understanding of the meaning of non-trivial topology in open
systems.

## Chapter \thechapter Density response function in Rashba nanowires: a
linear response approach292929The results of this chapter are being
prepared for publication.

In this Chapter we investigate the density-density response function in
nanowires with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, where a Zeeman field is
applied perpendicular to the spin-orbit axis. Then, we extend the
analysis and consider induced @xmath -superconductivity into the
nanowire, which is solve by taking zero interband pairing and then the
strong Zeeman field limit. This analysis is carried out based on the
linear response theory. Then, we use these results in order to
investigate electron-electron interactions in the longitudinal direction
of the wire within the Random Phase Approximation approach (RPA). In
this part, we have calculated the dielectric function, and then the
charge density-density response as well as the screened potential which
allows us to describe screening effects in such nanowires.

### 27 Introduction

Nanowires with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) are a solid platform for
investigating Majorana bound states (MBSs). In fact, it was shown that
when a Zeeman field @xmath is applied, perpendicular to the spin-orbit
axis, and @xmath -wave superconductivity is induced, the nanowire
becomes a topological superconducting nanowire for fields exceeding
@xmath , which is defined in terms of the induced superconducting
pairing @xmath and the wire’s chemical potential @xmath . See Chapter
Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful
platforms to study Majorana bound states for details. A significative
number of measurements on electronic systems can be investigated by
applying a small external field, as a probe of a certain type, to the
system at an initial time and then focus on how the system responds.
When the field is small enough, the response is proportional (a linear
function) to the external perturbation, and the coefficient of
proportionality is the correlation function of the system in the
equilibrium ensemble without the perturbation. Therefore, the
description of the response is based on linear response theory [ 226 ] .
Within this approach, the correlations functions are also known as
linear response functions. The change in the density of a system due to
a local change in its density (the response of the expectation value of
the number density operator) is an example of such linear response
functions and it is described by the density-density response function
(also known as Lindhard function) [ 226 ] . The density-density response
function provides crucial information upon understanding static
screening, and, to the best of our knowledge, in nanowires with SOC and
Zeeman interaction it was not explored so far. The chemical potential in
the nanowire model for MBSs plays an important role, and in real
experiments it is tuned by means of electrostatic gates.
Electron-electron interactions can affect the real value of @xmath and
and therefore changing the topological transition point. A first step
for investigating electron-electron interactions in such nanowires can
be described within the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) and follows
from the knowledge of the density-density response function [ 226 ] .
Indeed, in a non-interacting electron gas, the (linear response) RPA
approach is the approximation in which the proper response function is
replaced by the density-density response function (also known as the
Lindhard function) [ 226 ] . We are interested in the electron-electron
interactions along the longitudinal direction of the wire as we believe
it is the most realistic situation. The calculation of the Lindhard
function is trivial for free electrons [ 226 ] , however, it becomes
complex when the system involves SOC, Zeeman fields or
superconductivity. In this Chapter we firstly provide a brief
introduction and then calculate the density-density response function in
one-dimensional nanowires with SOC and Zeeman interaction. Afterwards,
we consider induced @xmath -wave superconductivity into Rashba
nanowires, where our main interest is to calculate the density-density
response function in the regime of strong Zeeman field. The results of
the density-density response function allow us to investigate the
dielectric function, the charge density and screened potential within
the RPA approximation.

#### 27.1 Model

We consider a one-dimensional one mode wire with Rashba SOC and Zeeman
field, perpendicular to the spin-orbit axis, modelled by the following
Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (117)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the first, second and third terms are the kinetic, Rashba and
Zeeman Hamiltonians

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (118)
  -- -------- -- -------

The spin direction is such that @xmath . @xmath denotes the spin
direction along the @xmath -axis. The Hamiltonian @xmath in the basis
@xmath , @xmath being the transpose operation, can be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (119)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the Hamiltonian density, @xmath , reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (120)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the momentum operator, @xmath the electron’s effective
mass in the nanowire, @xmath the spin-orbit coupling strength, and
@xmath the Zeeman splitting due to the magnetic field @xmath .

The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the previous Hamiltonian are given
by,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (121)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath , @xmath is the dispersion relation for free
electrons, @xmath labels the two bands, @xmath the chemical potential
measured from the bottom of the band, @xmath , with @xmath , and @xmath
is the length of the wire. Notice that we have renamed the functions
@xmath in Eq. ( 42 ) by @xmath in Eq. ( 121 ).

#### 27.2 General concepts

When a system is perturbed by a external potential @xmath , its density
deviates from the equilibrium value, and the change induces an
additional potential @xmath . The total potential in the system is the
sum of the external and the induced potentials

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (122)
  -- -------- -- -------

and it is also known as the screened potential. If the perturbation is
weak, there is a linear relationship between the induced density and the
external potential

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (123)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the density-density response function. By using Poisson
and Eq. ( 122 ) and @xmath , the dielectric function is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (124)
  -- -------- -- -------

In general, previous equation is the exact structure of the dielectric
response where we need to know @xmath .

The screened effective potential is different from the bare external
potential, and therefore it is useful to define a proper density-density
response function, which gives the response of the induced density to
the screened potential @xmath . Therefore, the dielectric function and
the density response become,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (125)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (126)
  -- -------- -- -------

The Randon Phase Approximation replaces the induced charge without
interactions with the screened charge. Thus, in a non-interaction
electron gas, the (linear response) RPA approach is the approximation in
which the proper response function is replaced by the Lindhard function
[ 226 ] . The Lindhard function is the density-density response function
defined in Eq. ( 146 ).

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (127)
  -- -------- -- -------

So that the RPA dielectric function is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (128)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the RPA charge density by,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (129)
  -- -------- -- -------

Notice that @xmath represents the Coulomb interaction which depends on
the dimensionality of the problem. In our case, it corresponds to a
one-dimensional wire. To derive such potential, one examine the
representation of the Yukawa interaction in an infinite cylindrical wire
of radius @xmath , where the transverse wave-function is assumed to be
gaussian. Thus, arriving at [ 226 ] ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (130)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the exponential-integral function

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (131)
  -- -------- -- -------

being @xmath the radius of the wire and @xmath the vacuum permittivity.
Notice that @xmath diverges logarithmically for @xmath , imposing that
the use of finite @xmath in one-dimensional wires is both a physically
realistic characteristic and a mathematical requirement [ 226 ] . See
for instance right panel in Fig. 74 . The Fourier transform of the
Coulomb potential is given by, see left panel in Fig. 74 ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (132)
  -- -------- -- -------

The dielectric function is a property of the material being
investigated, and usually assumed constant. We will see that, in
general, it depends on various parameters of the system and considering
it as a constant implies somehow a naive approximation.

The screened potential for a point charge with @xmath , given by Eq. (
130 ), can be calculated as follows [ 226 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (133)
  -- -------- -- -------

or its Fourier transform as, in the static limit @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (134)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the integral includes the whole @xmath -space, @xmath . Previous
equation represents the screened potential of the point charge potential
@xmath within the RPA approximation, since the dielectric function
@xmath is calculated in such approximation. Likewise, the induced
density from Eq. ( 123 ) can be written in the RPA limit as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (135)
  -- -------- -- -------

or its Fourier transform

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (136)
  -- -------- -- -------

We have seen in this subsection that, within the Random Phase
Approximation (RPA), the Lindhard function (density response function)
@xmath provides a simple but powerful tool in order to investigate the
dielectric function, charge density and screened potential. This, of
course, represents a first step in order to understand electron-electron
interactions in Rashba nanowires.

##### 27.2.1 Finite length considerations

In order to take into account the length of the wire, one can define a
new potential @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (137)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we have introduced @xmath to count for the one dimensional
electron density which in general depends on @xmath and on the
parameters of the system under investigation. In principle, the electron
density should be calculated self-consistently using the Poisson and
BdGs equations, however, for simplicity we assume that the electron
density remains roughly constant within @xmath , @xmath , where @xmath
represents the wire’s length. Thus, the integral over @xmath in previous
equation is finite for @xmath , then for the screened potential, in the
wire of length @xmath , we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (138)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we have assumed constant density in the wire. Similarly, for the
RPA induced density in the finite length wire we get from Eq. ( 136 )

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (139)
  -- -------- -- -------

Instead of using a self-consistent solution of the Poisson-BdGs
equations in @xmath , for simplicity we just consider @xmath . Notice
that @xmath is the perturbation to the electron density of the infinite
wire @xmath , which can be calculated as follows. Indeed, from Eq. ( 121
) we can solve for @xmath and get @xmath , where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (140)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . The density of states can be
calculated from previous equation as @xmath . Thus, the electron density
@xmath is calculated by integrating the density of states up to the
Fermi level, which is defined by the chemical potential @xmath . Then,
for @xmath , both Rashba bands are occupied and therefore

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (141)
  -- -------- -- -------

When the chemical potential is within the Zeeman gap, @xmath , only the
lower band is occupied and therefore

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (142)
  -- -------- -- -------

And for @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (143)
  -- -------- -- -------

Previous formulae provide analytics for the electron density for a
Rashba nanowire.

#### 27.3 Screening of the Coulomb potential with constant dielectric
function

In our previous discussion, we have shown that the dielectric function
can be calculated from the density-density response function following
RPA and linear response theory. On the other hand, it is usually
considered that the static dielectric function is a parameter of the
system and assumed to be a known quantity, being approximately @xmath
for InSb. However, later in this Chapter we will see that it strongly
depends on the wave-vector @xmath , but before going further, we first
discuss the situation with constant dielectric function, @xmath . Then,
we can write Eq. ( 134 ) as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (144)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we have suppressed the notation @xmath in @xmath for obvious
reasons and @xmath is the 1D Coulomb potential [ 226 ] given by Eq. (
130 ).

As before, a finite length wire @xmath is taken into account by
integrating over @xmath , with @xmath the electron density,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (145)
  -- -------- -- -------

In Fig. 75 we plot the screened Coulomb potential as a function of
@xmath , given by Eq. ( 144 ), for different values of the dielectric
constant @xmath and wire’s radius @xmath . For small @xmath (top left
panel), the behaviour of the screened potential @xmath follows the
typical @xmath decay, however, as @xmath is increased, @xmath
experiments a considerable reduction for all @xmath and roughly
preserving the @xmath shape for small @xmath . This implies that the
screened lengths are reduced by increasing @xmath . Notice also that by
increasing the wire’s radius @xmath (top right and bottom panels), the
values of the screened potential at small @xmath considerable decrease.
For huge values of @xmath (bottom right panel), the @xmath decay is
practically lost and the potential tends to decrease linearly.

In Figs. 76 and 77 we plot the screened potential in a wire of finite
length @xmath as a function of @xmath , @xmath , given by Eq. ( 145 ),
for different values of the dielectric constant and the wire’s radius.
In both cases, the screened potential tends to be reduced by approaching
the edges of the wire, while acquiring a flat shape in the bulk. Notice
that by increasing the dielectric constant, @xmath is considerable
reduced (see for instance different curves in left top panel of Fig. 76
), and an increase in the wire’s radius also introduces a reduction in
the screened potential (compare top panels), as also observed in Fig. 75
. On the other hand, as one increases the length of the wire @xmath ,
the values of the screened potential are enhanced and the flatness
behaviour in the bulk is more robust. The lowest curves (red curves) in
previous figures correspond to @xmath , typical value of the dielectric
constant for InSb wires. Observe that for long finite wires with large
radius @xmath the values of the screened potential @xmath tend to be
around @xmath .

In this part we have learned that depending on the values of the
dielectric constant @xmath , the screened potential may acquire
different values. Small (big) values of @xmath lead to big (small)
values of the screened potential. Additionally, we have seen that
increasing the wire’s radius also tend to reduce the screened potential.
These effects remain in both infinite and finite wires. The introduction
of the finite wire’s length also affect the screened potential at the
wire edges.

Next we will see how previous results change when the dielectric
function is calculated from the density response function within the RPA
and linear response approaches.

### 28 Density response function in Rashba nanowires

In this part we calculate the density response function @xmath in
nanowires with spin-orbit coupling and subjected to an external Zeeman
field, perpendicular to the spin-orbit axis, following the linear
response approach [ 226 ] . From previous section we know that @xmath
allows us for studying screening effects in these one-dimensional
systems. Although a full exact analysis should be done by solving the
Poisson-BdGs equations, we believe that the treatment we do here
represents a first step towards the understanding of electron-electron
interactions in such nanowires.

#### 28.1 Density response function with SOC and Zeeman interaction

We calculate the density-density response function for a homogeneous
non-interacting 1D nanowire in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit and
Zeeman interactions following the linear response theory [ 226 ] .

The response function in momentum and frequency space is given by [ 226
]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (146)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we have denoted @xmath and

  -- -- -- -------
           (147)
  -- -- -- -------

Here, @xmath represents the electron density operator. In second
quantisation, @xmath can be written in terms of electron field
operators. The relation between the annihilation field operator @xmath ,
at position @xmath and time @xmath , and any other set of annihilation
operators @xmath is given by @xmath , where @xmath represent the
one-electron wave functions and @xmath labels spin, momentum, etc.
Therefore, it is natural to use the eigenstates @xmath , given by Eq. (
121 ), to construct such field operators. The electron density operator
is then written as [ 226 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (148)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then, we can write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (149)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath . Now, we plug the wave functions given in Eq. ( 121 ) into
previous equations, and get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (150)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , and @xmath Then, we introduce the equations for the
electron density operator, given by Eqs. ( 150 ), into the average of
the commutator given by Eq. ( 147 ). After some algebra we can get the
static limit of the density-density response function, see Eq. ( 416 )
in Appendix Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as
useful platforms to study Majorana bound states for more details on the
derivation,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (151)
  -- -------- -- -------

At zero temperature @xmath , the Fermi distribution function @xmath
becomes a step function @xmath , which is @xmath for @xmath or @xmath ,
otherwise. The function @xmath restricts the @xmath integration to
interval @xmath , with @xmath defined from Eq. ( 121 ), @xmath , where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (152)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath , @xmath and @xmath .

In Fig. 78 we present the static density-density response function,
given by Eq. ( 151 ), as a function of the momentum @xmath for different
values of the Zeeman field. The @xmath limit of the static density
response function is a measure of the number of excited states available
to the system for vanishing excitation energy. Therefore, unlike the
free electron case [ 226 ] , the density response function, given by
Eq. ( 151 ), is zero at @xmath , and that is because the external
magnetic field introduces a gap into the system [ 226 ] . Another
important feature of the density response function given by Eq. ( 151 )
is that it develops three clear resonance peaks at @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath , and also an almost invisible kink for @xmath close to @xmath
corresponds to @xmath . This is different from to the free electron
case, where only one peak at @xmath [ 226 ] . The positions of these
peaks are shown in left panel of Fig. 78 , while in the right panel one
observes its evolution as the Zeeman field increases. The peaks are
visible as long as they are real. Indeed, in Fig. 78 , for
experimentally reasonable values of @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , one
observes that for @xmath , the density response @xmath exhibits the
three clear resonant peaks at the corresponding @xmath and an almost
invisible kink as explained above. On the other hand, when @xmath ,
@xmath , defined by Eq. ( 152 ), becomes completely imaginary and
therefore the system involves only one Fermi momentum leaving only the
resonance at @xmath . Notice that the almost invisible kink close to
@xmath happens at @xmath as long as such wave vectors are real, which
means for @xmath , otherwise such resonance peak is the same as the one
at @xmath . Important, such peaks can be interpreted as evidence of
static charge density waves.

In Subsec. 27.2 we have introduced the RPA approach in order to
calculate the dielectric function. We have pointed out that in this
approach the proper response function is the density-density response
function ( or Lindhard function), see Eq. ( 128 ). Thus, in order to
calculate the dielectric function for Rashba nanowires, we use the
density-density response given by Eq. ( 151 ), and then plug into Eq. (
128 ). The results are shown in Fig. 79 , where we present the
dielectric function as a function of momentum @xmath in the RPA
approach. In this part we have also the Coulomb potential in 1D derived
in [ 226 ] , see Eq. ( 130 ). In Fig. 79 the nanowire’s radius @xmath is
fixed.

Since the dielectric function is calculated from the density response
function, one expects that such function still contains information
about the resonance peaks, as one can indeed observe in Fig. 79 . We
also notice that the resonance peaks in the dielectric function @xmath
are not of the same high as in the density response function @xmath ,
see Fig. ( 78 ).

The visibility of the resonance peaks also depends on the new length
scale introduced with the wire’s radius. Indeed, observe the evolution
of the dielectric function @xmath at fixed Zeeman field for @xmath and
@xmath in left and right panels of Fig. ( 80 ). In the former case, the
two Fermi wave vectors @xmath are real and therefore the dielectric
function develops the three resonance peaks at @xmath , @xmath , @xmath
, and a small kink at @xmath . While in the latter, @xmath is imaginary
and only one resonance peak at @xmath is observed. In both cases, as the
wire’s radius increases, the resonance peaks are reduced and even
completely washed out when @xmath is long enough. It seems that the
resonance peaks are visible as long as @xmath , where @xmath .

In Fig. 81 , we present the charge density response function in the RPA
approach as a function of the momentum, @xmath , for different values of
the wire’s radius, calculated from Eq. ( 129 ). Top panels correspond
for @xmath , while bottom for @xmath . Notice that, in the former case,
the expected resonance peaks, which appeared in the density response
function in Fig. 78 at @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and a small kink at
@xmath , are only visible when the radius of the wire is made very large
(see dashed lines in top panels). On the other hand, in the latter, for
@xmath , @xmath is imaginary and only one resonance peak is the one
associated to @xmath , as one indeed observes (see dashed line at high
momentum). Interestingly, at small momentum, the charge density, @xmath
, develops a resonance, which is visible for @xmath nm (for parameters
given in caption of Fig. 81 ) and follows the rule @xmath , where @xmath
is the Fermi length @xmath .

### 29 Density response function in superconducting nanowires

The aim of this part is to calculate the response function in strong
Zeeman fields, as it is the one that corresponds to the topological
superconducting phase with MBSs.

In this part we consider the same Rashba nanowire as in the previous
section, and place it in proximity to a @xmath -wave superconductor with
Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (153)
  -- -------- -- -------

For introducing superconductivity, we first write down the full system
Hamiltonian, @xmath , in the so-called helical basis given by Eqs. ( 49
), whose description was given in Sections 5 and C . In such basis, the
full Hamiltonian is written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (154)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (155)
  -- -------- -- -------

represent the different pairing functions that arise in our nanowire due
to the interplay of Rashba SOC and Zeeman interaction when placed on a
@xmath -wave superconductor. The first line of Eq. ( 154 ) is just the
normal Rashba nanowire Hamiltonian, while in the second line, the first
and second terms associated to @xmath , describe pairing between states
of the same @xmath band, while the third term associated to @xmath ,
represent pairing between states of different band.

Eq. ( 154 ) can be written in Nambu space,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (156)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian reads

  -- -- -- -------
           (157)
  -- -- -- -------

whose eigenvalues read, see Eq. ( 54 ),

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (158)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath by Eqs. ( 155 ). At @xmath the lower
band, @xmath , develops a gap, as shown in Sec. 5 , and follows

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (159)
  -- -------- -- -------

which closes at @xmath , determining the topological phase transition
point into a topological superconducting phase with Majorana bound
states at the end of the wire.

On the other hand, for zero interband pairing, @xmath , we are left with
pairing potentials between states of the same band, only. This could
mimic the physics of two p-wave superconductors with pairing potentials
@xmath and @xmath . In this regime, the BdG Hamiltonian reads,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (160)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the energy spectrum reads,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (161)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath and the superconducting pairing potentials are of @xmath
-wave nature

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (162)
  -- -------- -- -------

At @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (163)
  -- -------- -- -------

so that there is a closing of the gap at low momentum when @xmath . This
resembles to the closing of the gap at @xmath when the interband
pairing, @xmath , is not zero.

#### 29.1 Density response function: zero interband pairing, two band
model

For simplicity, we calculate the density response function when the
pairing of states of different band is zero. Effectively, it is similar
to a situation with two p-wave superconductors. We follow [ 226 ] . We
start but calculating the density response with SO and Zeeman field, and
then use the bogoliubov transformation found in previous chapter in
order to write the helical basis in the quasiparticle one.

The density-density response function is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (164)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -- -- -------
           (165)
  -- -- -- -------

Here, @xmath is the electron density operator. We have seen in previous
section that, in second quantisation, the electron density operator can
be written in terms of field operators

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (166)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath are wave functions of the Rashba-Zeeman problem

  -- -- -- -------
           (167)
  -- -- -- -------

We then write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (168)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (169)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (170)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now, we insert previous equations into Eq. ( 165 ), and then sum over
@xmath . Moreover, since we are dealing with a superconducting system,
operators @xmath are transformed into new ones according to the
Bogoliubov transformation described in detail in Appendix N.1 . We are
interested on the zero temperature and zero frequency limit, and after
some algebra, see Appendix N for details, we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (171)
  -- -------- -- -------

with the superconducting coherence factors given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (172)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

represent the @xmath -wave nature of the superconducting pairing
potential, and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (174)
  -- -------- -- -------

is the coefficient arising from the interplay of the Rashba SOC and
Zeeman interaction. Notice that the summation in @xmath in Eq. ( 171 )
is replaced by an integration over @xmath : @xmath , and the limits of
integration includes all @xmath , i.e. @xmath . We do not discuss the
results obtained in this part because what interests us is the strong
Zeeman regime, which is discussed next.

#### 29.2 Density response function in strong Zeeman field: one band
model

In this part we address the situation of high Zeeman field @xmath . In
this case, only the lowest band, @xmath , is occupied. In a situation of
high magnetic field, the system is in the topological phase and one can
project the full Hamiltonian onto the lower band @xmath , then

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (175)
  -- -------- -- -------

Previous Hamiltonian can be written in the BdG form in the @xmath basis,
thus

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (176)
  -- -------- -- -------

with energy dispersion given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (177)
  -- -------- -- -------

and @xmath -wave superconducting pairing potential

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (178)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now, we calculate the density-density response function following the
linear response theory described in [ 226 ] , as we have done in
previous subsection. The response function in momentum and frequency
space is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (179)
  -- -------- -- -------

where, @xmath ,

  -- -- -- -------
           (180)
  -- -- -- -------

where @xmath is the electron density operator. In second quantisation ,
@xmath can be written in terms of the helical field operators described
in the previous section

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (181)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -- -- -------
           (182)
  -- -- -- -------

are the wave functions of the Rashba-Zeeman problem, and @xmath . Hence,
Eq. ( 181 ) can be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (183)
  -- -------- -- -------

By inserting previous relations into the equation for the density
response we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (184)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now, we assume the situation of high Zeeman field, where only the lowest
band, @xmath , is occupied. Therefore, in Eq. ( 489 ) the unique
combination that we need is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (185)
  -- -------- -- -------

In order to describe the system with superconducting effects, we need to
transform our @xmath operators in Eq. ( 490 ) into the new ones @xmath
according to the Bogoliubov transformation we have found in Eq. ( 468 )
or  ( 469 ). In momentum space, the static response function at zero
temperature, see Appendix N.2 , then we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (186)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is valid only for high Zeeman fields @xmath . Previous equation is
the density-density response function also known as the Lidnhard
function. Previous equation represents the density-density response
function in a 1D superconducting wire with Rashba and Zeeman interaction
with only the lowest band occupied, also known as the Lindhard function.
The coherence factors coming from the spin-orbit and Zeeman effects is
given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (187)
  -- -------- -- -------

while the one from the superconductor

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (188)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (189)
  -- -------- -- -------

In Fig. 82 the density response function, given by Eq. ( 186 ), is
plotted. The expected resonance at @xmath is observed, which
consequently is suppressed by increasing the superconducting pairing.
Notice that the small momentum limit is really sensible to any change in
@xmath , while higher momentum is roughly constant. This resonance at
@xmath gives rise to the so-called Friedel oscillations, which can be
observed by Fourier transformed Eq. ( 499 ) into @xmath -space. The
Fermi momentum is @xmath , where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath .

In Fig. 83 the dielectric function in the RPA limit, given by Eq. ( 128
), is plotted. The resonance at @xmath is still visible for a certain
range of the wire’s radius @xmath , but it is completely lost when
@xmath (see top right panel). A feature that is really sensible to any
change in @xmath is the small @xmath region with a complex dependence on
@xmath , while the high momentum one exhibit a decay behaviour
converging to @xmath . The dependence of the dielectric function on the
spin-orbit coupling, superconductivity, Zeeman and superconductivity, is
given in top right, bottom left and right panels, respectively. An
increase in the SOC, the resonance peak is slightly moved towards higher
momenta, as indeed expected indeed, and the high of @xmath at small
@xmath is decreased, but its width is constant. The effect of the
superconducting pairing is observed in the bottom left panel. While it
washes out the resonance when increased but maintaining fixed its the
position, the hight of the dielectric function is considerably reduced.
In the bottom right panel, the Zeeman field is increased. The position
of the resonance is then also moved towards higher momenta as in the
case when the SOC is increased. An important feature of the small
momentum window is that the width of resonance-like behaviour is varied,
unlike the situation with different SOC and superconductivity.

Now, we are in a position to investigate the screened potential within
the RPA approach @xmath [ 226 ] . In Subsection 27.2 we described the
screened potential @xmath for a point charge with electron-electron
interaction in one dimension @xmath given by Eq. ( 130 ). Such screened
potential is described by Eq. ( 133 ) in momentum space or by Eq. ( 134
) in real space, for @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (190)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now, we discuss the screened potential @xmath for an infinite nanowire
with Rashba SOC, Zeeman interaction and superconductivity calculated
from Eq. ( 190 ) as a function of the distance @xmath . Fig. 84 show
such situation for different values of the Zeeman field @xmath and
different values of the wire’s radius @xmath . The potential exhibits a
clear decay for small @xmath with the so-called Friedel oscillations
whose amplitude is reduced as @xmath increases. Note that the
oscillations are reduced by increasing the wire’s radius and completely
washed out for realistic experimental values (see brown curve). Notice
that for small values of @xmath and @xmath the screened potential takes
huge values and diverges for @xmath due to the logarithmic divergence of
the 1D Coulomb potential @xmath . The oscillatory behaviour depends on
the Fermi wave vector @xmath defined in Eq. ( 152 ) and therefore on the
system parameters ( @xmath ). For increasing such parameters the
oscillations become more extended so that they are not observed (not
shown). The decay of the screened potential is slow and the finite value
of the potential for long distances @xmath strongly depends on the
superconducting pairing @xmath as shown in Fig. 85 , where we present
the screened potential as a function of @xmath for different values of
the superconducting pairing @xmath with oscillations (small @xmath , top
row) and without them (large @xmath , bottom panel). From such plots one
can conclude that the long @xmath limit do not decay, however, we have
checked that @xmath in fact exhibits a really slow decay. First, the
superconducting pairing does not influence on the shape of the
oscillations for small @xmath . As increasing @xmath the potential for
different @xmath acquire different values but still preserving the
oscillatory behaviour. For long @xmath and small @xmath the values of
the screened potential are reduced. This effect is observed for
different values of the wire’s radius @xmath , as shown in Fig. 85 .

On the other hand the induced density was defined in momentum and real
space by Eqs. ( 135 ),

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (191)
  -- -------- -- -------

and in real space by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (192)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the density-density response function.

The induced density @xmath has to be understood as a correction for the
electron density @xmath of the infinite wire given by Eq. ( 142 for high
Zeeman fields), resulting in @xmath . In Fig. 86 we plot the electron
density given by Eq. ( 142 ) for an infinite Rashba wire. Notice the
dependence on the system’s parameters and it increased as one increases
the Zeeman field.

In Fig. 87 is plotted the induced density @xmath given by Eq. ( 192 ) as
a function of the distance @xmath (top row) for two values of the Zeeman
field and different radius of the wire @xmath and (bottom row) for two
values of the wire’s radius and different Zeeman fields.

The induced density @xmath at small @xmath tends to be negative which
arises from the logarithmic divergence (small @xmath ) of the 1D Coulomb
potential @xmath and it is suppressed when the wire’s radius @xmath
takes realistic values @xmath nm. As we have explained before, the
negative value the induced density @xmath means that the total electron
density @xmath is reduced at small @xmath due to the electron-electron
interaction, since @xmath corresponds to deviations from the electron
density in equilibrium without perturbation ( @xmath for an infinity
wire given by Eq. ( 142 )). As @xmath increases the induced density
captures the oscillatory pattern of the density-density response
function @xmath , which are suppressed at long distances @xmath .

In order to take into account the finite length of the wire, @xmath , we
have defined a new potential @xmath , where @xmath represents the wire’s
length,

  -- -- -- -------
           (193)
  -- -- -- -------

and for the induced density from Eq. ( 139 ), we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (194)
  -- -------- -- -------

Notice that for simplicity we have defined the electron density in the
wire as @xmath , being @xmath the length of the wire, and do not follow
more complicated schemes as the Poisson approach. By doing such
assumption for @xmath we do not have any dependence on the system
parameters such as @xmath that in principle @xmath has. A full
Poisson-BdGs solution should take into account these details.

In Fig. 89 we present the screened potential as a function of the
position calculated from Eq. ( 193 ) for a short and long wire,
respectively, for different values of the wire’s radius. The
denomination short and long is made by comparing the wire’s length with
@xmath . The screened potential develops the expected oscillatory
behaviour in the wire, which represent the well-known Friedel
oscillations. In a long wire it acquires a higher amplitude, although
such oscillations are more visible in a short wire than in a long one as
one can indeed see. Moreover, one notices that by increasing the wire’s
radius the oscillatory behaviour of the screened potential is reduced,
and even washed out. For a reasonable long wire with a realistic radius,
the potential is constant in the bulk, while it is reduced at the edges.

The screened potential @xmath introduces a change in the chemical
potential @xmath so that the new chemical potential is @xmath . First,
one notices that due to this dependence, the topological transition
point determined by @xmath is affected and becomes @xmath . A full
analysis requires to include the full band calculation in the density
response function and therefore be able to map the topological
transition by increasing the Zeeman field, which is planned for a future
study. Based on the results obtained in the strong Zeeman regime, this
new chemical @xmath allows us to investigate the Majorana wave function
amplitude as a function of the position in the wire and compare it to
the situation with @xmath . Additionally, we can also calculate the
low-energy Andreev spectrum and focus on its evolution of @xmath , being
valid only for strong @xmath . All these calculations form part of a
future study in order to provide a full RPA analysis of the Majorana
problem in nanowires.

### 30 Conclusions

In this Chapter we have calculated the density-density response function
in one-dimensional superconducting nanowires with spin-orbit coupling
and Zeeman fields. Firstly, we have investigated the density-density
response function in isolated wires. Then, we have considered a
proximitized nanowire, where the density-density response was calculated
taking into account zero-interband pairing and later in a strong Zeeman
regime, being the latter of great relevance as such limit corresponds to
a situation with MBSs. The analysis was done within the linear response
theory framework. Then, we used these results in order to investigate
electron-electron interactions in the longitudinal direction of the wire
within the Random Phase Approximation approach. In this part, we have
calculated the dielectric function, and then the charge density-density
response as well as the screened potential for the infinite wire as well
as for a finite length wire.

## Chapter \thechapter Conclusions

In this thesis we have investigated hybrid superconductor-semiconductor
junctions made of semiconducting nanowires with Rashba spin-orbit
coupling. Along this thesis, we emphasise the importance of employing
hybrids superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions towards the
unambiguously detection of Majorana bound states (MBSs) beyond zero-bias
anomalies. We have analysed the low energy Andreev spectrum, phase and
voltage-biased transport, have proposed a new scheme for engineering
MBSs in trivial NS junctions and at the end have performed an analysis
of screening properties in Rashba nanowires based on linear response
theory and Random Phase Approximation.

The main results of the thesis can be summarised as follows:

-    In chapter Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions
    as useful platforms to study Majorana bound states we have presented
    in detail how hybrid NS and SNS junctions are modelled based on
    semiconductor nanowires with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In this
    part, we have showed that emergence of Majorana bound states is
    distinguishable in the Andreev spectrum (see for instance Fig. 36 ).
    Despite of being @xmath periodic, the Josephson current exhibits a
    clear reduction in the topological phase and when, additionally, the
    Majorana overlap is negligible (see for instance Fig. 43 ) it
    develops a distinguishable sawtooth profile at @xmath . Remarkably,
    the critical current traces the closing and reopening of the
    topological gap, exhibiting a robust and non-trivial feature at the
    gap closing, remaining finite in the topological phase and revealing
    the Majorana oscillations (see Fig. 45 ).

-    In chapter Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions
    as useful platforms to study Majorana bound states we have studied
    transport in a voltage-biased short
    superconductor-normal-superconductor (SNS) junction made of
    semiconducting nanowires with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, as the
    applied Zeeman field drives the system into the topological
    superconducting phase. We have shown that the dissipative multiple
    Andreev reflection (MAR) current at different junction
    transparencies exhibits unique features related to topology such as
    gap inversion, the formation of MBSs and fermion-parity
    conservation. We predict the halving of MAR steps owing to the
    presence of Majorana bound states in the junction (see Fig. 49
    (a,d)) as well as the possibility of observing the transition into
    the topological superconducting phase directly in the critical
    current of the junction (see Fig. 50 ).

-    In chapter Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions
    as useful platforms to study Majorana bound states we have extended
    traditional conceptions and made a detailed study on the role that
    confinement and helicity have on normal transport and on the sub-gap
    Andreev spectrum in short and long SNS junctions made of
    semiconducting nanowires (NWs) with strong Rashba spin-orbit
    coupling. We found that a long junction with a helical normal
    section but still in the topologically trivial regime, supports a
    low-energy sub-gap spectrum consisting of multiple zero-energy
    crossings that smoothly evolve towards MBSs as the junction becomes
    topological (see for instance Fig. 62 ). This indeed suggests an
    interesting connection between subgap parity crossings in helical
    junctions with @xmath and Majorana bound states in topological ones
    with @xmath .

-    In chapter Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions
    as useful platforms to study Majorana bound states we have proposed
    an alternative route for engineering MBSs with non-topological
    superconducting wires, which consists of creating a sufficiently
    transparent normal-superconductor (NS) junction on a Rashba wire,
    with a topologically trivial superconducting side and a helical
    normal side. The zero-energy state emerges as the junction traverses
    an exceptional point at the threshold transparency and becomes
    robustly pinned to zero energy without fine tuning by virtue of
    charge-conjugation symmetry. Finally, we have shown that relevant
    transport and spectral properties associated to these zero energy
    states, here dubbed are indistinguishable from those of conventional
    MBSs (see for instance Fig. 72 ).

-    In chapter Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions
    as useful platforms to study Majorana bound states we have
    investigated screening properties of proximitized nanowires with SOC
    and Zeeman fields within RPA and linear response theory. This,
    indeed, represents a relevant step for experiments trying to measure
    Majorana bound states and their non-trivial overlap.

With the recent advance in fabrication techniques and induced hard-gaps
technology [ 113 , 115 ] , we expect that our research reported here
will support new experiments towards the unambiguously detection of
MBSs.

## Chapter \thechapter Resumen y conclusiones

En 1937, Ettore Majorana postuló que la equation de Dirac se puede
escribir en una base donde sus soluciones son campos reales [ 30 ] .
Esto permite dividir la ecuación de Dirac en dos sistemas de ecuaciones
independientes, cada una con dos ecuaciones acopladas. La solucion a uno
de estos representa un campo real, @xmath , y por ende la partícula
asociada a dicho campo es su propia antipartícula, @xmath . Esta
partícula es fermiónica, espín @xmath , neutral, y se denomina fermión
de Majorana. El origen de los fermiones de Majorana está en física de
partículas, donde aun no se ha determinado completamente si los
neutrinos obedecen dicha fenomenología.

Por otro lado, en materia condensada ha despertado mucho interés la idea
de tener partículas que sean sus propias antipartículas. El origen de
este interés está en varias predicciones teóricas en torno al año 2010
que demostraron que los superconductores topológicos, la variante
superconductora de los aislantes topológicos, poseen excitaciones de
cuasipartícula de tipo Majorana [ 27 , 37 ] . La conexión formal con la
física de altas energías se encuentra en la simetría de conjugación de
carga: la simetría electrón-hueco, en lenguaje de física de la materia
condensada, que todo superconductor posee. Efectivamente, las
excitaciones sobre el estado fundamental BCS en un superconductor son
superposiciones cuánticas de electrones y huecos que se denominan
cuasipartículas de Bogoliubov. Una cuasipartícula de Bogoliubov a
energía cero es perfectamente neutra (mitad electrón-mitad hueco) y por
tanto, igual a su propia antipartícula. El último ingrediente para que
una excitación de Bogoliubov sea de tipo Majorana es que no tenga
degeneración de espín y, por tanto, todas las propuestas para generar
superconductividad topológica se basan en superconductores de onda
@xmath , debido a que estos poseen fases topológicas. Téngase en cuenta
que, en materia condensada, lo que ha llamado mucho la atención son
estas cuasipartículas con car·cter Majoránico pero a energía cero. Estas
no tienen analogía en física de partículas, pero aún obedecen @xmath
(donde @xmath viene a ser un operador Majoránico). Las fases con estados
de Majorana se pueden distinguir de otras por medio de invariantes
topológicos, que en este caso es el número Majoránico. Los estados de
Majorana a energía cero aparecen como estados ligados a interfaces con
diferente topología y es por eso que también se les denomina estados
ligados de Majorana (MBSs). Aparte de su interés fundamental, estas
excitaciones en un superconductor topológico poseen estadística cuántica
no-Abeliana, sin análogos en el modelo estándar de la física de
partículas, que da lugar a una forma de computación cu·ntica muy robusta
[ 24 ] .

Hasta hace poco, la necesidad de trabajar con superconductores de onda
@xmath se consideraba una limitación poco menos que insalvable, dada su
escasez en la naturaleza y su sensibilidad al desorden. Esta situación
ha cambiado en los últimos años con varias propuestas teóricas que
demuestran que es posible generar de manera efectiva superconductividad
de onda @xmath combinando materiales con fuerte acoplo espín-órbita
(aislantes topológicos o semiconductores con acoplo Rashba) a
superconductores usuales con simetría de onda s [ 39 , 41 , 61 ] . Una
de las plataformas mas prometedoras consiste en nanohilos
semiconductores con fuerte acoplamiento de espín órbita [ 41 , 61 ] .
Cuando en el nanohilo se induce superconductividad de onda @xmath , el
nanohilo entra en la fase topológica cuando @xmath , donde @xmath es el
campo crítico y señala la transition topológica dando origen a la
inversión del gap, @xmath es el potencial químico del nanohilo y @xmath
el pairing superconductor inducido en el nanohilo.

La posibilidad de obtener superconductividad topológica combinando estos
materiales más comunes generó altas expectativas y muchos laboratorios
del mundo se lanzaron a la carrera para detectar por primera vez una
partícula de Majorana. El experimento pionero corresponde al grupo de
Delft [ 67 ] , donde miden la emergencia de un pico a voltaje cero en la
conductancia diferencial de una unión híbrida
semiconductor-superconductor como característica de la emergencia de un
estado ligado de Majorana. Experimentos posteriores [ 45 , 46 , 47 , 48
, 49 ] también muestran datos consistentes con cuasipartículas de
Majorana sin embargo no es posible descartar otras explicaciones
alternativas del origen de los picos a voltaje cero, tales como
desorden, efecto Kondo, etc.

Muchas de las preguntas han sido parcialmente resultas últimamente, sin
embargo, aún se requiere estudios adicionales con nuevas propuestas.
Adicionalmente, recientemente ha habido un gran avance en la fabricación
de uniones híbridas, donde se ha logrado sintetizar sistemas con
hard-gaps inducidos [ 113 , 115 , 118 ] .

El objetivo de esta tesis es proponer y analizar posibles protocolos de
detección más allá de esta primera generación experimental. Por lo antes
expuesto, esta tesis está dedicada a investigar propiedades de
transporte en sistemas híbridos NS y SNS basaos en nanohilos
semiconductores, así como también estudiar la emergencia de los estados
de Majorana en dichas estructuras. Una de las ventajas de las uniones
SNS es, por ejemplo, que permite estudiar el monitoreo detallado de
algunos observables con respecto a la diferencia de fase
superconductora.

En el capítulo Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as
useful platforms to study Majorana bound states se da una introducción
general a la superconductividad topológica en una dimension basados en
el modelo de Kitaev para superconductividad de onda @xmath , y además
mostramos la emergencia de los estados de Majorana a energía cero al
final del nanohilo. Luego se describe el modelo físico basado en
nanohilos semiconductores con espín órbita tipo Rashba, donde un campo
magnético Zeeman @xmath es aplicado y superconductividad de onda @xmath
es inducida en el nanohilo. Se asume que existe buen contacto entre el
nanohilo y el superconductor de tal manera que correlaciones
superconductoras sean inducidas al nanohilo por medio del efecto
proximidad. Esto da origen a un nanohilo superconductor que cuando el el
campo magnético aplicado es mayor que @xmath se convierte en un nanohilo
superconductor topológico con estados de Majorana al final del nanohilo,
uno en cada lado. Aquí, resaltamos que los estados de Majorana a energía
cero aparecen en la fase topológica ligados a interfaces de diferente
topología, con su función de onda decayendo hacia el bulk.

En el capítulo Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as
useful platforms to study Majorana bound states , en primer lugar, se
introducen los conceptos básicos en uniones híbridas
Normal-Superconductor (NS) y Superconductor-Normal-Superconductor (SNS):
reflexión de Andreev (AR) y estado ligado de Andreev (ABS). Aquí también
clasificamos las uniones SNS en cortas ( @xmath ) o largas ( @xmath ),
donde @xmath es la longitud de la región normal y @xmath es la longitud
de coherencia superconductora. Luego nos centramos en describir
detalladamente como modelamos estas uniones híbridas a partir de
nanohilos semiconductores con espí-órbita tipo Rashba, sujetos a un
campo magnético y donde superconductividad de onda @xmath es inducidad
en el nanohilo. Para esto, discretizamos el Hamiltoniano para el
nanohilo en una red tight-binding, para luego escribir el Hamiltoniano
del sistema en espacio Nambu. A partir de esto calculamos los niveles de
energía ya sea para un nanohilo superconductor, unión NS o unión SNS. En
el caso de uniones SNS, mostramos la evolución detallada de los niveles
como función de la diferencia de fase desde la fase trivial hacia la
fase topológica con estados de Majorana. Debido a la longitud finita de
S, en este caso el sistema posee cuatro estados de Majorana cuando la
diferencia de fase es @xmath . Resaltamos en esta parte que, debido a
que últimamente se viene investigando experimentalmente espectroscopía
de niveles, es posible realizar un estudio experimental, similar al que
hacemos, para detectar la presencia de los estados de Majorana. Además
mostramos que tanto la corriente Josephson como la corriente crítica,
calculadas a partir de los niveles, poseen información relevante sobre
los estados de Majorana. Sorprendentemente, la corriente crítica como
función del campo Zeeman traza perfectamente la evolucion hacia la fase
topológica. Esta adquiere un valor no nulo en la transición topológica,
aquí el sistema no tiene gap, y se mantiene finito a medida que el campo
aumenta. Sin lugar a dudas, esto da origen a características no usuales
y solamente relacionadas con la emergencia de los estados de Majorana.
Por eso creemos que estas características pueden ser distinguibles
experimentalmente en uniones con nanohilos.

En el capítulo Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as
useful platforms to study Majorana bound states se propone una forma
potente y sencilla para detectar estados ligados de Majorana (MBSs) en
una unión híbrida SNS, donde un voltage constante es aplicado. Aquí, se
estudia transporte Josephson bajo voltage constante en una unión SNS
hecha de nanohilos con espín-órbita fuerte, a medida que el sistema
experimenta una transición hacia la fase topológica cuando aumentamos el
campo Zeeman. La unión SNS es formada por dos leads superconductores
semi-infinitos, y por lo tanto solo dos estados de Majorana emergen en
la unión. Usando la técnica de las funciones de Green de Keldysh,
proponemos que las corrientes debido a las múltiples reflecciones de
Andreev (MAR) asícomo también la corriente crítica sirven como una forma
alternativa y potente para estudiar la transición topológica. Esto se
hace posible debido al efecto directo que la inversión del gap, la
formación de MBSs y la conservación de la paridad fermiónica tienen en
la corriente MAR para diferentes transparencias de la unión. Por otro
lado, también demostramos que la corriente crítica es inesperadamente
finita para todo campo Zeeman debido a la contribución del continuo, y
exhibe una anomalía en la transición topológica que podría ser
experimentalmente localizada y distinguida, como también se predice en
el capítulo Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as
useful platforms to study Majorana bound states .

En el capítulo Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as
useful platforms to study Majorana bound states estudiamos transporte
normal y el espectro subgap en uniones superconductoras SNS hechas de
nanohilos semiconductores con un fuerte acoplamiento espín-órbita tipo
Rashba. Nos centramos, en particular, en el papel que los efectos de
confinamiento tienen en uniones balísticas largas. En el régimen normal,
scattering en los dos contactos da lugar a dos características distintas
de la conductancia: resonancias Fabry-Perot y dips Fano. Estas últimas
se producen en presencia de un fuerte campo Zeeman @xmath que elimina un
sector de espín en los leads (leads helicales), pero no en la región
central. Inversamente, una región central helical entre los conductores
no helicales presenta gaps helicales de la mitad de la cuántica
conductancia, con oscilaciones helicales Fabry-Perot superpuestas. Estas
características normales se traducen en distintos estados subgap cuando
los leads se convierten en superconductores. En particular, resonancias
Fabry-Perot dentro del gap helical se convierten en cruces de estados a
energía cero protegidos por la paridad (cruces de paridad), muy por
debajo del campo crítico @xmath en el que los leads superconductores se
convierten en topológicos. Como función del campo Zeeman o energía de
Fermi, estos modos oscilan alrededor de energía cero, formando loops
característicos, que evolucionan continuamente hacia estados ligados de
Majorana cuando @xmath excede @xmath . En esta parte también se discute
la relación con la física de los cruces de paridad de estados ligados de
Yu-Shiba-Rusinov.

Sintetizar superconductores en su fase topológica con un gap robusto y
bien definido es la mayor dificultad práctica que presenta la propuesta
original. En el capítulo Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire
junctions as useful platforms to study Majorana bound states hemos
investigado una plataforma alternativa para crear estados ligados de
Majorana en nanohilos superconductors no topológicos. Nuestra propuesta
consiste en que en lugar de inducir la transición topológica en un
nanohilo en proximidad a un superconductor de onda @xmath , se debe
conectar el nanohilo superconductor trivial a un metal normal helical
por medio de un contacto transparente. Esta nueva propuesta representa
un gran avance y tiene muchas ventajas sobre los esquemas
convencionales, ya que los superconductores topológicos son sensitivos
al desorden y llegar a la fase topológica implica un gran desafío
experimental en muchos de ellos. Dicha unión puede ser realizad
experimentalmente, por ejemplo, poniendo en proximidad una sección
finita del nanohilo con acoplamiento espín-órbita, y combinando gates
electrostáticos y un campo Zeeman para llevar la sección que no está en
proximidad al superconductor hacia su fase helical. En nuestra
propuesta, los estados de Majorana a energía cero emergen en dicho
sistema abierto sin la necesidad de fine-tuning como resultado de la
simetría de conjugación de carga, y puede ser ligado a la existencia de
puntos excepcionales (EPs) en el espacio de parámetros, donde dos
estados cuasi ligados de Andreev se bifurcan en dos estados ligados de
Majorana a energía cero. Después del EP, uno de los estados cuasi
ligados de Andreev se vuelve no-decaying a medida que la unión se
aproxima a reflexión Andreev perfecta, resultando asi en un estado de
Majorana dark (MDS) localizado en la unión NS. Aquí se muestra que los
MDSs poseen propiedades asociadas a los estados ligados de Majorana
convencionales en sistemas cerrados, sin la necesidad de requerir
superconductividad topológica.

Por otro lado, en el capítulo Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor
nanowire junctions as useful platforms to study Majorana bound states
usamos teoría de respuesta lineal para calcular la función de respuesta
de densidad en nanohilos con acoplamiento espín-órbita y campo Zeeman
aplicado. Mostramos también que en esto puede generalizarse cuando el
sistema se vuelve superconductor. Para ello nos centramos en dos
límites: el primero, donde el sistema posee dos bands pero el pairing
entre bandas es cero y por ende posee una transición topológica;
mientras que en el segundo nos centramos en el regimen de campos altos
cuando el sistema está en la fase topológica. Luego, dentro de la Random
Phase Approximation (RPA), calculamos la función dieléctrica, luego la
densidad de carga y el potencial de apantallamiento. Debido a la
simpleza del enfoque, esperamos que los resultados sean cualitativamente
consistentes con métodos auto-consistentes.

Esperamos que el trabajo presentado en esta tesis abra nuevos horizontes
hacia la detección de estados ligados de Majorana en materia condensada.

## Chapter \thechapter Appendix for Chapter Hybrid
superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful platforms to
study Majorana bound states

In this chapter we provide additional details for a complete description
of the introduction, thus making this thesis self-contained.

## Appendix A Details of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian

The reduced pairing Hamiltonian, given in the main text by Eq. ( 121 ),
emerges as a result of the electron-electron interaction Hamiltonian [
58 ] ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (195)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the first term describes free electrons, while the second one the
interactions with strength @xmath . Regarded to Eq. ( 121 ), we write
down the two parts of such Hamiltonian, @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (196)
  -- -------- -- -------

Because fluctuations are small with respect to non-zero expectation
values of operators @xmath , it is appropriate to write down [ 57 ]

  -- -- -- -------
           (197)
  -- -- -- -------

where the second terms in the right hand side, in previous two
equations, represents the fluctuation around which the averages of the
operators, the first terms, fluctuate. Then, the interaction part of the
pairing Hamiltonian can be written as,

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

In the mean-field approach, the terms @xmath in previous expression are
neglected, since fluctuations are assumed to be small. Therefore, the
mean-field interaction Hamiltonian can be written as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now, we are in position to define fundamental the averages of two
creation or annihilation operators as the superconducting pairing
potential @xmath , leading to macroscopic quantum coherence of the
system. This represents the fundamental characteristic of the
superconducting state. A superconducting system is in a ordered state,
and the pairing potential is also known as the order parameter [ 59 , 57
, 58 ] . Thus, the mean-field pairing Hamiltonian reads,

  -- -- -- -------
           (198)
  -- -- -- -------

which is the one given in Eq. ( 12 ).

Superconducting systems require to treat electrons and holes on the same
footing. This is why one follows the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism [ 58
] , where one introduces a redundant description that will be clear in
the following. Let us first write the kinetic term of Eq. ( 198 ),

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (199)
  -- -------- -- -------

where in the second equality in the first line, we have used usual
anti-commutation relations for fermionic operators @xmath , and in the
second line we have just relabelled @xmath to @xmath . Now, we assume
@xmath to be independent of @xmath , and proceed with the second term in
Eq. ( 198 ) similarly as for the kinetic term,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (200)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (201)
  -- -------- -- -------

In previous two equations we have used @xmath , and @xmath . Then, Eq. (
198 ) reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (202)
  -- -------- -- -------

Previous equation can be rewritten in a matrix form, then

  -- -- -- -------
           (203)
  -- -- -- -------

We notice that in this elegant form, we have introduced a new spinor
basis containing creation and annihilation operators. These operators
define the so-called Nambu representation [ 58 ] , which emerges
naturally in superconducting systems and we define them as,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (204)
  -- -------- -- -------

We point out that such representation is not unique but the physics
remains the same. The matrix in Eq. ( 203 ) is the so-called
Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian [ 59 , 57 , 58 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (205)
  -- -------- -- -------

The last two terms in Eq. ( 203 ) are constant and usually dropped off
in the literature. Thus, the spectrum of Eq. ( 203 ) is found after
solving the eigenvalue problem @xmath , and given by Eq. ( 17 ), where
the eigenvalues form the diagonal elements of @xmath in the new basis
and represent the quasiparticle excitations in a superconductor.

#### Bogoliubov transformation

The ground state of a superconductor is formed by Cooper pairs, while
the quasiparticle excitations in a superconductor are separated from
such ground state by an energy gap, as seen in Eq. ( 17 ), and can
emerge by breaking a Cooper pairs. Therefore, it is natural to look for
a relation between operators @xmath and the new ones denoted with @xmath
next, where the @xmath is diagonal, with the energies given by Eq. ( 17
). The new basis is found by projecting the spinor @xmath , given in
Eq. ( 204 ), onto the eigenvectors of @xmath

  -- -- -- -------
           (206)
  -- -- -- -------

where @xmath is the spinor representing the new basis, @xmath is an
unitary operator formed by the eigenvectors of @xmath , which connects
these two basis,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (207)
  -- -------- -- -------

being a @xmath matrix due to spin and electron-hole symmetries. Notice
that the columns of @xmath are the eigenvectors of @xmath . We will see
that the unitary matrix @xmath can be also constructed by placing the
eigenvectors as rows, instead of columns, in @xmath , giving rise to
@xmath , which is also unitary matrix and also diagonalizes @xmath .
Taking the Hermitian conjugate of Eq. ( 206 ) one has @xmath . Then,
because @xmath , one has the inverse transformation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (208)
  -- -------- -- -------

The transformation given by Eq. ( 206 ), or the inverse given by Eq. (
208 ), are known in the literature as the Bogoliubov-Valatin
transformation, but we will refer to it as Bogoliubov transformation,
only. We have pointed out that the unitary matrix, which connects the
two basis is formed out by the eigenvectors of @xmath , becoming our
first task in the following part.

##### The eigenvectors

We start by solving the eigenvalue problem for @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (209)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the @xmath identity matrix. The eigenvalues then read
@xmath . Now, we go back to the first equation of Eqs. ( 209 ) and using
the known eigenvalues and the form of the eigenvectors, we write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (210)
  -- -------- -- -------

From previous system of equations, one observes that they can be written
in two groups,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (211)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (212)
  -- -------- -- -------

which can be solved separately because spin up and down electrons are
not coupled, but rather electrons and holes through the pairing
potential @xmath . Additionally, one indeed notices that in these two
groups only one equation matters, since the two equations are coupled
and therefore contain redundant information. The fact that there are two
groups corresponding to up and down spins, which can be solved
separately, allows us to define eigenvectors associated to the first and
second group, respectively,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (213)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the zeroes in @xmath and @xmath correspond to elements that are
not present in Eqs. ( 211 ) and Eqs. ( 212 ), respectively. The first
component in the second equality of @xmath corresponds electron part
with spin up (down), while the second to the respective hole part with
spin down (up) (because a hole is a time-reversed electron). The other
equation that helps us to solve such systems is the normalisation
condition associated to @xmath : @xmath and @xmath

From Eqs. ( 211 ), for @xmath , one has

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (214)
  -- -------- -- -------

and normalization condition dictates

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (215)
  -- -------- -- -------

For finding @xmath , one takes the positive value of @xmath in previous
equation and then plug it into first equation of Eqs. ( 214 ), then

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (216)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (217)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we have rewritten it as a four component vector according to
Eqs. ( 213 ), and we have defined, up to a phase,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (218)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the same way, for @xmath , we have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (219)
  -- -------- -- -------

and normalization condition dictates

  -- -- -- -------
           (220)
  -- -- -- -------

then, by taking the positive value of @xmath , up to a phase, and
plugging it back into the first equation of Eqs. ( 219 ) one finds

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (221)
  -- -------- -- -------

We notice that, according to definitions given by Eqs. ( 218 ), for
@xmath , we have obtained @xmath and @xmath . Then,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (222)
  -- -------- -- -------

where according to Eqs. ( 213 ) we have written as a four component
vector. Therefore, the results we have obtained are, as four component
vectors,

  -- -- -- -------
           (223)
  -- -- -- -------

In a similar fashion one can proceed for Eqs. ( 212 ), and after some
algebra obtains

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (224)
  -- -------- -- -------

##### The transformation

Now, going back to the unitary transformation, it is important to
remember that the problem was defined in two parts and therefore the
four equations were divided in two groups of two equations each and
solved separately. The unitary matrix, given by Eq. ( 207 ), is then
carefully rewritten as

  -- -- -- -------
           (225)
  -- -- -- -------

Therefore, the unitary operators are given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (226)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then, according Eq. ( 206 ), @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (227)
  -- -------- -- -------

one arrives at

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (228)
  -- -------- -- -------

or the inverse, @xmath , by Eq. ( 208 ),

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (229)
  -- -------- -- -------

leading to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (230)
  -- -------- -- -------

To finish this part, we point out that the other unitary matrix that
diagonalises @xmath is @xmath , being @xmath the transpose operation.
Then, according Eq. ( 206 ), @xmath , one has

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (231)
  -- -------- -- -------

or the inverse, @xmath , following Eq. ( 208 ),

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (232)
  -- -------- -- -------

Equations 228 and 230 or 231 and 232 constitute the so-called
Bogoliubov-Valatin transformations.

Notice that, for instance, from Eqs. ( 228 ) one can write

  -- -- -- -------
           (233)
  -- -- -- -------

and therefore conclude that @xmath is connected to @xmath through the
so-called electron-hole symmetry of @xmath discussed in the main text.

#### Comment on singlet and triplet superconductors

Pauli inclusion principle imposes that the pairing function must be
antisymmetric, then

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (234)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the @xmath denotes the spin indices. We can separate the spin part
from the orbital part, then

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (235)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, in the case of singlet pairing, the spin part is odd, while
the orbital part is even, the orbital part fulfils

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (236)
  -- -------- -- -------

and thus we have the pairing symmetry of the so-called @xmath -wave
superconductor.

On the other hand, in the case of triplet pairing, the spin part is
even, while the orbital part is odd, then for the orbital part

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (237)
  -- -------- -- -------

and we therefore have the pairing symmetry of the so-called @xmath -wave
superconductor.

Of course that our discussion is oversimplified and does not consider
other pairing symmetries such as @xmath etc. The aim of this part is
just to point out the difference between @xmath and @xmath -wave
superconductors, since these two types are discussed in this thesis.

## Appendix B Kitaev’s model: open and closed periodic boundary
conditions

In this section we provide additional details, which complete the
description of the Kitaev’s model.

#### Open chain

Here, we concentrate on the chain with @xmath fermionic sites, where the
first and the last are not connected. We refer to this approach as to
the open chain case. The Kitaev model, @xmath , given by the Hamiltonian
in Eq. ( 22 ) with elements

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (238)
  -- -------- -- -------

was written as Eq. ( 24 ) by transforming fermionic operators @xmath
into Majorana ones according to Eqs. ( 3 ). Here, we complete the
derivation by expressing each Hamiltonian term into the new basis,
assuming real pairing potential @xmath . Therefore, in terms of the
Majorana operators, we have

  -- -- -- -------
           (239)
  -- -- -- -------

Previous equations can be rewritten as

  -- -- -- -------
           (240)
  -- -- -- -------

In the following, we make use of the algebra for Majorana operators
given by Eqs. ( 4 ), where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (241)
  -- -------- -- -------

Thus, according to Eqs. ( 238 ), the necessary expressions are given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (242)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, the Hamiltonian elements given by Eqs. ( 238 ) in the
Majorana basis read

  -- -- -- -------
           (243)
  -- -- -- -------

The full Hamiltonian, @xmath , is then written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (244)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is the one given in the main text by Eq. ( 24 ), with @xmath and
@xmath .

We have discussed in the main text the emergence of zero energy Majorana
modes at the end of the chain, one at each end, in the topological
phase. At this point, Majorana operators @xmath and @xmath , at the end
of the chain, do not enter in the Hamiltonian given by Eq. ( 26 ), and
therefore the following relations hold

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (245)
  -- -------- -- -------

Thus, if @xmath is the energy of the ground state @xmath , then @xmath .
Now, by employing Eqs. ( 245 ), we write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (246)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then, previous discussions imply the following relations

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (247)
  -- -------- -- -------

Previous two equations manifest the fact that we can create a pair of
Majorana states at the end of the chain, represented by operators @xmath
and @xmath , with one Majorana at each end. Remarkably, after we create
this pair, the new state is still the ground state with the same energy
@xmath as @xmath , indicating that there is no cost of energy to create
a pair of Majorana states at the ends of a superconducting chain.

By fusing the two unpaired Majorana operators @xmath and @xmath , we
have defined a zero energy fermion represented by new operators @xmath
and @xmath , see Eq. ( 30 ). Hence, from Eq. ( 247 ), one can show that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (248)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then, the ground states of @xmath can be spanned by operators @xmath and
@xmath . The occupation number operator is defined as @xmath , while the
fermion parity operator as @xmath . Let us now calculate

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (249)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, previous equations indicate that we can use the occupation
number @xmath in order to label the ground states. The two ground states
are then the empty state @xmath and the occupied one @xmath satisfying
@xmath and @xmath .

#### Closed periodic boundaries

The assumption of a chain forming a closed loop with periodic boundary
conditions, requires to add an extra term given by Eq. ( 22 ) to the
Hamiltonian, arriving at the Hamiltonian given by Eq. ( 32 ). The goal
is to write down the Hamiltonian given by Eq. ( 32 ), which is in site
space, in momentum space. Thus, we perform Fourier transformations of
the fermion operators @xmath as follows

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (250)
  -- -------- -- -------

An implication of the periodicity of the lattice is that wave-vectors
@xmath that differ by a reciprocal lattice vector are the same, so that
the sum over @xmath is limited to the first Brillouin zone:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (251)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the following we will make use of the discrete representation of the
Kronecker delta function

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (252)
  -- -------- -- -------

According to Eq. ( 32 ), the fermion operators we need are the
followings,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (253)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (254)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we have used that @xmath . This is also used next,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (255)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (256)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (257)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, the Hamiltonian given by Eq. ( 32 ) in momentum space reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (258)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the normal energy dispersion. In what follows, we make
use of the redundant behaviour to treat electrons and hole at the same
footing, introduced when we discussed the Bogoliubov formalism in Sec. 3
. Thus, formally, we can rewrite the fermion operators involved in
previous Hamiltonian as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (259)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, Eq. ( 258 ) reads,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (260)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the first term represents the kinetic part for electrons and
holes, respectively, the second term is a constant usually neglected.
The third term in previous equation is the pairing part of the
Hamiltonian, where fermions with momentum @xmath and @xmath are paired
together. Notice that there are two special points in @xmath -space with
zero contribution to the pairing Hamiltonian because @xmath . Eq. ( 258
) can be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (261)
  -- -------- -- -------

We have seen in Sec. 3 that when dealing with electrons and holes, in
superconducting systems for instance, it is natural to define Nambu
spinors

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (262)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then, Eq. ( 261 ) can be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (263)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we have used that @xmath , since @xmath is an even function of
@xmath , @xmath , and @xmath being the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian.
Notice that @xmath is odd in @xmath , thus exhibiting its @xmath -wave
nature.

## Appendix C Rashba nanowire model

In this section we provide additional details that we find useful in
order to have a complete view of what we present in Sec. 5 of the main
text.

#### c.1 Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the Rashba normal system

In this part we calculate the eigen vectors for the Rashba system
subjected to a perpendicular Zeeman magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for
the normal system @xmath is given by Eq. ( 41 ). The eigenvalues and
eigenvectors are found by solving the eigenvalue equation @xmath , where
@xmath are the eigen-values and @xmath the eigenvectors that due to spin
are two dimensional spinors. The problem can be solved by supposing that
solutions are given in terms of plane waves of the form @xmath , where
@xmath stands for the transpose operation, and then one introduces them
back into Eq. ( 41 ). For the eigevalues, @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (264)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath . Now, by using the calculated eigenvalues and the form of
the wavefunctions, one is able to find the values of @xmath and @xmath .
Of course, we should not forget the normalization condition @xmath .
Then, by writing down the eigenvalue equation,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (265)
  -- -------- -- -------

we can write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (266)
  -- -------- -- -------

which are two coupled equations. Only one gives us relevant information:
one can express @xmath in terms of @xmath or the inverse, the result
won’t change. Now, we use the first equation and express @xmath in terms
of @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (267)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the wavefunctions hence reads,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (268)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath . Hence,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (269)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath can be calculated from the normalization condition

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (270)
  -- -------- -- -------

therefore @xmath up to a phase that we do not consider for making the
discussion easier. Then

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (271)
  -- -------- -- -------

On the other hand, we could also consider the second equation in 266 ,
then

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (272)
  -- -------- -- -------

and proceeding in the same way as before we find

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (273)
  -- -------- -- -------

Both solutions, Eq. ( 271 ) and Eq. ( 273 ) are equivalent. In the main
text, we consider the wavefunctions in the form given by Eq. ( 271 ). We
comment here that the eigenvectors shown in Eq. ( 42 ) are normalised to
a finite region of length @xmath , that is why in such equation we find
the factor @xmath .

The momenta where the energy intersects the @xmath -axis are determined
from @xmath , then,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (274)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (275)
  -- -------- -- -------

We identify that @xmath and @xmath , the wavevectors associate to the
eigenvalues @xmath , as shown in Fig. 90 The spectrum in this case has
extremes at @xmath and at @xmath , and the corresponding energies are
@xmath and @xmath , respectively.

#### c.2 Role of the Zeeman field parallel to the spin-orbit axis

In this subsection we discuss the role of a Zeeman magnetic field
parallel to the spin-orbit axis, which is considered to be

  -- -- -- -------
           (276)
  -- -- -- -------

where @xmath is the magnitude of such field. The full Hamiltonian is
then given by @xmath , and the Zeeman field contains two components
@xmath . The perpendicular component is given by Eq. ( 39 ) and denoted
simple by @xmath in the main text. This term is the usual term
considered in the literature and it plays a fundamental part towards the
physical implementation for the search of MBSs in Rashba nanowires. On
the other hand, we point out that experimentally is not so easy to
control the magnetic field along a certain direction, giving rise to a
non-zero components in both perpendicular and parallel directions. This
motivates us in order to discuss the role of the component parallel to
the spin orbit axis. Notice that now the Zeeman field is a vector with
two components and can be parametrized as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (277)
  -- -------- -- -------

The full Hamiltonian, @xmath , can be then written in Nambu basis,
@xmath , so that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (278)
  -- -------- -- -------

where,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (279)
  -- -------- -- -------

is the Bogoliubov de Gennes Hamiltonian. The Pauli matrices @xmath and
@xmath act in spin and electron-hole subspaces, respectively. The
spectrum is then given after solving the eigenvalue problem @xmath ,
from where one gets the polynomial

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (280)
  -- -------- -- -------

For @xmath , the spectrum reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (281)
  -- -------- -- -------

and its evolution with the Zeeman field is depicted in Fig. 11 . Notice
that in the main text we denoted @xmath . We have seen that proximity
induced superconductivity modifies the gap at @xmath , originally opened
by the perpendicular Zeeman field, and opens a gap of @xmath , at finite
momentum. The topological transition is marked by vanishing the gap at
small momenta @xmath . It happens at the critical field defined as
@xmath , where for @xmath the system host two Majorana bound states at
the end of the wire. While the gap at small momenta gets reduces as one
increases @xmath and it closes at the critical field @xmath , the outer
gap @xmath remains roughly constant in strong SOC at @xmath for any
@xmath . See App. LABEL:appendixgapsapp .

Hence, it is natural to ask whether the condition, @xmath at @xmath ,
holds or not for a non-zero paralell component @xmath . Further insight
can be extracted from the energy spectrum, but first let us check some
situations. We solve @xmath and get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (282)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

where @xmath and @xmath are defined in Eq. ( 280 ).

The inner gap at zero momentum, @xmath , is calculated from Eqs ( 282 ),
and reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (283)
  -- -------- -- -------

If one now introduces Eqs. ( 277 ) into previous equation, we get @xmath
. Therefore, we conclude that at this point the condition of the closing
of the gap for entering into the topological phase does not change.

On the other hand, the outer gap at high momentum, @xmath , is not
constant anymore and exhibits a different behavior as it was for zero
parallel field, shown in App. LABEL:appendixgapsapp . To have an
intuition of what is happening, in Fig. 91 we plot the solutions given
by Eqs. ( 282 ) for different values of @xmath . One observes that the
outer gap, for @xmath at @xmath and @xmath at @xmath , decreases as one
increases @xmath . This behavior is important as it is the constantness
of such gap the one that offers topological protection towards physical
implementation of quantum computation free of decoherence. Thus, we are
interested in knowning when such gap reaches zero. We solve @xmath at
@xmath for @xmath and get the condition when such bands reach zero
energy,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (284)
  -- -------- -- -------

This can be understood in the following oversimplified view. Indeed,
despite of being in the topological phase or not, the perpendicular
component does not play a transcendental role at the outer branch in
case of strong SOC and the momentum is almost constant @xmath .
Therefore, the problem can be analyzed in a situation of zero
perpendicular @xmath . Thus from @xmath one gets

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (285)
  -- -------- -- -------

In right panel of Fig. 91 we plot the band spectrum in zero and finite
perpendicular field, corresponding to Eqs. ( 285 ) and ( 282 ),
respectively. One indeed notices that for @xmath the agreement is very
good, as we expected. Without loss of generality, one can tune the
chemical potential to zero @xmath . Then from Eqs. ( 285 ) @xmath at
@xmath one has the condition for the closing of the outer gap: @xmath [
227 ] . Inverse iteration: To support our finding about the condition of
the closing of the outer gap, inverse iteration method can be employed [
228 ] . Here, the wave-function corresponding to @xmath can be used to
find @xmath around @xmath and therefore calculate the outer gap by means
of inverse iteration [ 228 ] . First, we solve @xmath at @xmath , from
where we get @xmath at @xmath . A general solution thus reads @xmath ,
where @xmath is the normalization condition.

For strong SOC, the wave-function reads @xmath , where @xmath . The
improved eigenvector @xmath for any @xmath around @xmath is then
calculated from @xmath . Since we already know the wave function at
@xmath for @xmath , we can improve such eigenvalue by inverse iteration
using @xmath for any @xmath around @xmath . Indeed, the improved
eigenvalue correction reads, @xmath , where the first term is zero at
@xmath and we only have a contribution from the second term. Here @xmath
and @xmath are already known from previous discussion, therefore the
improved eigenvalue then reads,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (286)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath . Eq. ( 286 ) can be then expanded around @xmath , @xmath
for small @xmath , where we find

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (287)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and @xmath . At @xmath , the outer gap @xmath ,

  -- -- -- -------
           (288)
  -- -- -- -------

In Fig. 92 we plot previous equation as function @xmath and the exact
value calculated from Eqs. ( 282 ). Our result by inverse iteration is
in a good agreement only when the parallel field @xmath is close to
@xmath , as we have indeed expected.

#### c.3 Full Rashba Hamiltonian in the helical basis

In this part we show how the Hamiltonian for the Rashba nanowire in
proximity to a @xmath -wave superconductor, @xmath given by Eq. ( 44 ),
is written in the so-called helical basis [ 39 , 51 ] ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (289)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath are operators that annihilates states in the upper/lower
bands and @xmath the respective normalized wavefunctions given by Eq. (
42 ) that we decompose into the two spinor components

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (290)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (291)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath . According to previous discussion, it is more appropriate
to write down Eq. ( 289 ) as follows

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (292)
  -- -------- -- -------

which using Eqs. ( 290 ) and ( 290 ) become

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (293)
  -- -------- -- -------

In what follows, we proceed to express the terms of the full Hamiltonian
given by Eq. ( 44 ) in the basis given by Eqs. ( 292 ), resp. by Eqs. (
293 ).

##### Kinetic term

The kinetic Hamiltonian is given by,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (294)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath . Now, we use Eqs. ( 293 ), and then write the elements of
previous Hamiltonian in the so called helical basis,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (295)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we have used that @xmath . Now, we add up previous two expressions
for @xmath and @xmath , and plug them into the kinetic Hamiltonian given
by Eq. ( 294 ),

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (296)
  -- -------- -- -------

##### Spin-orbit and Zeeman terms

The spin-orbit Hamiltonian from Eq. ( 38 ) reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (297)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then we express the terms of previous Hamiltonian using Eqs. ( 293 ),

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (298)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, subtracting previous two equations just to get the spin-orbit
Hamiltonian we have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (299)
  -- -------- -- -------

The Zeeman Hamiltonian from Eq. ( 39 ) reads,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (300)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, using the same terms that helped us to express the spin-orbit
Hamiltonian, we arrive at

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (301)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now, we add up the spin-orbit and Zeeman terms derived above

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (302)
  -- -------- -- -------

Next, we write down some useful relations, to be used later, derived
from the definition of @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (303)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then, we work out the elements of Eq. ( 302 , and get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (304)
  -- -------- -- -------

##### Kinetic, spin-orbit and Zeeman terms

Now we add up the three terms we have calculated in previous
subsections, Therefore, we can write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (305)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath are the eigenvalues of the Rashba problem with Zeeman field
given by Eq. ( 42 ).

##### The superconducting term

The superconducting Hamiltonian given by Eq. ( 43 ) is written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (306)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we have used fermion anti-commutations relations

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (307)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now, we express the elements of @xmath in terms of the helical basis,
given by Eqs. ( 293 ),

  -- -- -- -------
           (308)
  -- -- -- -------

Then, we further subtract previous two expressions in order to obtain
@xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (309)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the previous equation we identify four combinations of the operators
@xmath . In the following we write them separately as @xmath , where the
subscript @xmath stands for the combination @xmath . The @xmath term
then reads,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (310)
  -- -------- -- -------

where in the second equality we have made the substitution @xmath in the
second term. The @xmath term reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (311)
  -- -------- -- -------

where in the second equality we have made the substitution @xmath in the
second term. The terms @xmath can be grouped in one

  -- -- -- -------
           (312)
  -- -- -- -------

where in the second equality we have reordered the operator pairs just
to make visible the use of the fermionic commutation relation, @xmath ,
and the third equality we have used such relation, and in fourth
equality we have made the substitution @xmath in the second term.

We still need to evaluate some expressions with combinations of @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (313)
  -- -------- -- -------

then

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (314)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, the superconducting Hamiltonian reads,

  -- -- -- -------
           (315)
  -- -- -- -------

Notice in previous equation, the coefficients of the operators @xmath .
Such terms represent the pairing between bands @xmath and @xmath . We
therefore write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (316)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (317)
  -- -------- -- -------

##### Full Hamiltonian

The Hamiltonian describing a Rashba nanowire subjected to a Zeeman
interaction and superconducting correlations is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (318)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -- -- -------
           (319)
  -- -- -- -------

where @xmath is the Nambu spinor.

For the superconducting part we proceed in a similar way

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (320)
  -- -------- -- -------

then we can write previous Hamiltonian as

  -- -- -- -------
           (321)
  -- -- -- -------

where @xmath is the Nambu spinor. Therefore, the full Hamiltonian reads,

  -- -- -- -------
           (322)
  -- -- -- -------

where the pairing potentials are given in the previous subsection by
Eqs. ( 317 ). The matrix under the integral is the so-called BdG
Hamiltonian.

study Majorana bound states

In this Appendix we provide further details on NS and SNS junctions.

## Appendix D Tight-binding discretisation of the Rashba nanowire

For computation purposes, we consider a discretisation of the 1D
continuum model given by Eq. ( 98 ) for the Rashba nanowire into a
tight-binding (TB) lattice with a small lattice spacing @xmath . The
smaller is @xmath , the better is the description, and by letting such
lattice constant tend to zero one recovers the usual continuum limit. We
choose a discrete lattice whose points are located at @xmath , where
@xmath is an integer and @xmath the small lattice spacing. Notice that
by do so, we are trying to find a matrix representation of our 1D
continuum model in site space.

#### The kinetic term

The first term in our Hamiltonian is the kinetic energy operator @xmath
,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (323)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the momentum operator, and @xmath is the chemical
potential. In principle, @xmath depends on the spatial coordinate @xmath
, however, in most of our calculations we consider it as independent.
Therefore, in the TB representation, one is allow to write

  -- -- -- -------
           (324)
  -- -- -- -------

Now, the derivatives are expressed by using the method of finite
differences and in terms of creations and annihilation operators. Thus
the first derivative can be approximated by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (325)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, taking into account previous equation, the second derivative
can be approximated by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (326)
  -- -------- -- -------

On the other hand, the chemical potential @xmath is on-site dependent,
unlike the momentum operator that gives rise to hopping elements between
sites. Thus, we can write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (327)
  -- -------- -- -------

Hence, the Kinetic energy operator in the tight-binding approach can be
expressed as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (328)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the hopping energy parameter between nearest-neighbor
sites. Since we also consider spin, Eq. ( 328 ) has to be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (329)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the @xmath identity matrix.

#### The spin-orbit term

The spin-orbit term from Eq. ( 41 ) is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (330)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the momentum operator. Again, as before

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (331)
  -- -------- -- -------

For the first derivative we use

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (332)
  -- -------- -- -------

which can be understood as a symmetrized case of Eq. ( 325 ), since

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (333)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then, the SO term reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (334)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the SO hopping.

#### The Zeeman term

The Zeeman term from Eq. ( 41 ) is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (335)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is independent of the site index. Thus, it leads to an on-site
term in the tight-binding Hamiltonian in a similar way as the chemical
potential in the kinetic term.

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (336)
  -- -------- -- -------

#### The full Hamiltonian

Therefore @xmath reads,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (337)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the symbol @xmath means that @xmath couples nearest-neighbor
@xmath sites and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (338)
  -- -------- -- -------

are matrices in spin space, @xmath and @xmath .

## Appendix E General form of the current

The current from contact @xmath flowing through lead @xmath to the
central region can be calculated from the evolution of the total number
operator of fermions in such lead, and it is defined as [ 186 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (339)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the number operator for lead @xmath , and @xmath is the
electron charge, @xmath denotes the average over the ground state and
@xmath represents the derivative of @xmath over time. The time evolution
of the occupation number operator @xmath is described by the Heisenberg
picture, where the equation of motion for operators reads,

  -- -- -- -------
           (340)
  -- -- -- -------

and @xmath is the Hamiltonian of the entire system, which in principle
is time-dependent. The commutator of two operators reads @xmath , then
@xmath . Thus, Eq. ( 339 ) can be rewritten as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (341)
  -- -------- -- -------

The Hamiltonian @xmath usually has three terms: the first that
corresponds to the leads, the second to the central region and the third
one that take into account electron transitions between the leads and
the central region.

In our case the SNS system is described by the Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (342)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , @xmath , corresponds to Hamiltonians for leads left L and
right R, respectively, while @xmath is the central system Hamiltonian,
which is not superconducting, and the last term represents the
tunnelling Hamiltonian, which counts for electron transitions between
the leads and the central region . The matrices @xmath and @xmath have
Nambu structure

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (343)
  -- -------- -- -------

with known sub-matrices @xmath , which are in spin space. The particle
number operator @xmath commutes both with the corresponding Hamiltonian
of the isolated central system and with the Hamiltonian of the isolated
leads. The unique term changing particle numbers in each separate lead
is the tunnelling term, last term in Eq. ( 342 ), whose Hamiltonian is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (344)
  -- -------- -- -------

Notice that for a correct derivation, one needs to consider also the
hermitian conjugate of @xmath . Now we define the mixed lesser Green’s
functions

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (345)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then, the current can be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (346)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath counts for electrons and holes. The current is given by the
time diagonal components of the Green’s functions defined in Eq. ( 345
), @xmath . The problem is to find the mixed lesser Green’s function.
One can proceed with the Keldysh technique, where one employs the
mixed-contour-ordered Green’s function, @xmath , and then perform
analytic continuation to the real time to obtain the mixed lesser
function @xmath [ 186 ]

  -- -- -- -------
           (347)
  -- -- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath are the retarded and lesser full system Green’s
function, respectively. @xmath and @xmath are the isolated leads Green’s
functions defined as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (348)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the step function being @xmath for @xmath , and @xmath
otherwise. Then, the current acquires the form

  -- -- -- -------
           (349)
  -- -- -- -------

Now, we can introduce the lead’s self energies defined as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (350)
  -- -------- -- -------

therefore the current reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (351)
  -- -------- -- -------

## Appendix F Floquet-Keldysh formalism

Consider a mesoscopic system composed of two semi-infinite leads
(labeled @xmath and @xmath ), each in thermal equilibrium at the same
temperature @xmath and with the same chemical potential @xmath . Each
lead has a finite s-wave superconducting pairing @xmath , where @xmath .
A central system ( @xmath ), which may or may not be superconducting, is
coupled to both leads through operator @xmath . In its Nambu form, the
Hamiltonian of the system reads

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

where the Nambu Hamiltonian matrix takes the general form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Here @xmath is the normal Hamiltonian for each section of the system.
The blocks delimited by lines denote the Nambu particle, hole and
pairing sectors.

If we apply a left-right voltage bias @xmath through the junction, the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) pairing of the leads will become time
dependent, @xmath , while @xmath (we take @xmath ). Both these changes
can be gauged away from the leads and into the system by properly
redefining @xmath . This transformation is done also inside the system
@xmath , thereby effectively dividing it into two, the portion with an
@xmath phase (denoted @xmath ), and the portion with the opposite phase
(denoted @xmath ). This restores @xmath to its unbiased form, save for a
new time dependence in @xmath , which is constrained to the coupling
between the @xmath and @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It is important to note that @xmath is periodic, with angular frequency
@xmath . In the steady state limit (at long times @xmath after switching
on the potential @xmath ) all response functions and observables will
exhibit the same time periodicity (all transient effects are assumed to
be completely damped away). In particular, the steady state current
@xmath , so that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for some harmonic amplitudes @xmath , in general complex, that satisfy
@xmath since @xmath is real. This current can be computed using the
Keldysh Green’s function formalism [ 186 ] . The standard expression for
@xmath is computed starting from the definition of @xmath , where @xmath
is the total number of fermions in the left lead. By using Heisenberg
equation and the Keldysh-Dyson equation, one arrives at, see previous
section for details on the derivation,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The z-Pauli matrix @xmath above acts on the Nambu particle-hole sector,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The self energy from the left lead is defined as @xmath , where @xmath
stands for the left lead’s propagator, when decoupled from the system
(this propagator depends only on the time difference since the decoupled
lead is time independent in this gauge). We define the Fourier transform
of @xmath as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The retarded propagator in Fourier space is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

while the advanced @xmath . One can compute @xmath , where @xmath is the
Fermi distribution in the leads, and @xmath is the Nambu spectral
function. The @xmath [and in particular @xmath ] is assumed known, or at
least easily obtainable from @xmath and @xmath . Finally, the Green
functions @xmath and @xmath correspond to the propagator for the full
system, including the coupling to the leads. (Note that, in practice,
since @xmath is inside a trace in @xmath , only matrix elements of
@xmath inside the @xmath portion of the full system are needed). The
retarded @xmath satisfies the equation of motion

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

while @xmath (when projected onto the finite-dimensional system @xmath )
satisfies the Keldysh relation

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Since @xmath in @xmath is time dependent, @xmath propagators depend on
two times; unlike @xmath or @xmath they are not Fourier diagonal.
Instead, we can exploit the steady-state condition, which reads

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

to expand the system’s @xmath as a Fourier transform in @xmath and a
Fourier series in @xmath . We define

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The natural question is how the equation of motion is expressed in terms
of the harmonics @xmath . It takes the most convenient form if we
redefine @xmath (where @xmath is unbounded) in terms of the quasienergy
@xmath , i.e. @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This has the advantage that the equation of motion translates to a
matrix equation analogous to that of a static system in Fourier space

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This is known as the Floquet description of the steady state dynamics in
terms of sidebands, which appear formally as a new quantum number @xmath
. Time dependent portions of @xmath act as a coupling between different
sidebands. The effective Hamiltonian for the @xmath -th sideband is the
static portion of @xmath , shifted by @xmath . One therefore sometimes
defines the Floquet “Hamiltonian” of the system as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where, as before, @xmath . Likewise, one may define the Floquet
self-energies as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

(since the leads are static, @xmath is sideband-diagonal).

The Floquet equation of motion for @xmath can be solved like in the case
of a static system. Within the @xmath portion of the system, we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Boldface denotes the sideband structure implicit in all the above
matrices. Similarly, the Keldysh relation takes the simple form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Finally, the time averaged current @xmath takes the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (352)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the trace includes the sideband index. In a practical computation,
the number of sidebands that must be employed is finite, and depends on
the applied voltage bias @xmath (the typical number scales as @xmath ).
We employ an adaptive scheme that increases the number of sidebands
recursively until convergence for each value of @xmath .

## Appendix G Derivation of the current in the tunneling limit

In this part we aim at calculating the current in the tunneling limit.
The Hamiltonian for our system is given by Eq. ( 342 ).

According to Floquet’s theory, a periodic time-dependent system is
described in terms of sidebands, whose Hamiltonian is shifted by @xmath
. In this part we consider a subspace of one sideband, @xmath , where
the central system is composed of two sites, left and right. The role of
the leads are considered through their self energies. The full system
Hamiltonian is written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (353)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is given by Eq. ( 342 ) and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (354)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath represents that hopping between the two central sites
@xmath and @xmath , and it is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (355)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is an small parameter that describes the nature of the
junction that links the left and right superconductors, @xmath and
@xmath . As described in Floquet’s theory, the Hamiltonians for the
isolated central system sidebands are

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (356)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (357)
  -- -------- -- -------

and @xmath and @xmath are matrices in spin space. Notice that the
Hamiltonian for the left lead, considering a tight-binding model and
Nambu in each site, is infinite. We assume that the left and right leads
are attached at the left and right edges of the central system, so that
their self-energy terms ( @xmath ) only influence sites of the first and
last column of the central system. That means that since we deal with a
central system with sites @xmath and @xmath , the self-energy terms
@xmath will influence sites @xmath and @xmath , respectively. Since a
nearest-neighbor tight-binding model is used, the hopping matrices
between leads and central system have nonzero elements only between
sites on the surface of the lead and their neighboring sites in the
central system. This means that only the surface Green’s function @xmath
(big letters L and R label hte left and right leads, respectively) is
needed when one calculates the lead’s self-energies. In the Floquet
decomposition, one describes the central system in terms of sidebands.
These sidebands are coupled by the matrices @xmath and @xmath , and they
are identical copies of the original system with the difference that
their energies are shifted (due to the voltage bias): for a @xmath
sideband subspace we have @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , where the
original system is @xmath . @xmath . As we mentioned, in this part, we
consider one-sideband subspace, with three sites, @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath .

The general expression for the current is given by Eq. ( 352 ), for
@xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (358)
  -- -------- -- -------

where all the elements in previous equation are matrices in Floquet,
Nambu, sideband and central system subspaces. @xmath is the full system
Green’s function, while @xmath the self energy of both leads. In this
part we are interested in the tunnelling regime, meaning small
transparency across the junction. As we have discussed, our system
consists of two semiinfinite leads which are coupled through a central
region with two sites @xmath and @xmath . The hopping between these two
sites is reduced and parametrised by @xmath , where @xmath see Eq. ( 355
). For @xmath one models a tunnel junction. Then, we consider second
order terms in @xmath in Eq. ( 358 ). Notice that the self-energies are
proportional to @xmath , while the coupling matrix @xmath is given by
Eq. ( 354 ) and it is proportional to @xmath . Hence, the self energies
are of second order in @xmath and therefore in @xmath . Thus, a zeroth
order expansion of the Dyson’s equation is enough @xmath .

Therefore, in one sideband subspace ( @xmath ) reads,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (359)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the space of sidebands, the self-energy matrices are diagonal. Thus,
the lesser and advanced self-energies @xmath corresponding to lead
@xmath are,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (360)
  -- -------- -- -------

where each matrix element of previous two matrices is a @xmath matrix in
the central system subspace,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (361)
  -- -------- -- -------

The roll of the self-energies labelled with prime symbol will be
understood in the following.

The Nambu Pauli matrix @xmath in Eq. ( 358 ) is in the space of
sidebands ( @xmath ), in the space of left and right sites of the
central system, in spin space and electron hole, thus one can write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (362)
  -- -------- -- -------

where each element is in the space of left and right sites of the
central system, in spin space and electron hole @xmath .

Multiplying the matrices in Eq. ( 358 ) in the sideband subspace, we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (363)
  -- -------- -- -------

where all the elements are matrices in spin and the central system (left
and right) subspace. Tracing previous matrix over sidebands, we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (364)
  -- -------- -- -------

As discussed previously, we consider up to second order in @xmath , and
therefore a zeroth order expansion of the Dyson’s equation is enough (
@xmath ). Therefore, previous equation reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (365)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the Green’s function for the disconnected sideband
@xmath , whose matrix structure contains the influence of the left and
right leads propagators on the central system. Thus, in the space of
left and right leads, one has

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (366)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we approximate @xmath to be the leads Green’s function, @xmath ,
and then use

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (367)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath the spectral function, being Hermitian as well as @xmath .
We assume that @xmath is known and in our case calculated numerically.
Then, putting together both the self-energies and disconnected Green’s
functions, one gets the necessary elements for calculating the current
given by Eq. ( 358 )

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (368)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now, we are left with the self-energies. Projecting the self-energies on
the sideband subspace one gets,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (369)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the Green’s functions are given in Eq. ( 368 ), @xmath is given by
Eq. ( 354 ), and we rewrite it as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (370)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath describes the nature of the tunnel junction, and

Then, introducing Eq. ( 370 ) and ( 366 ) into Eq. ( 369 ), we get the
self-energies in their left/right structure

  -- -- -- -------
           (371)
  -- -- -- -------

Matrix elements in previous equations give the prime left self-energies
defined in Eq. ( 368 ), then

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (372)
  -- -------- -- -------

In what follows, we use the definitions given by Eq. ( 367 ). Then, we
add up the three terms given by Eq. ( 368 ), trace out over the central
system subspace, and then take the real part of Eq. ( 368 ),

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (373)
  -- -------- -- -------

The first term corresponds to sideband @xmath , the second and third to
@xmath and the last one to @xmath . Notice that previous equations do
not contain first order terms in @xmath . Previous equation can be
written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (374)
  -- -------- -- -------

where all elements are matrices in Nambu space (label by @xmath from
hereon: @xmath ). So that the spectral function, @xmath and the Fermi
distribution function read

  -- -- -- -------
           (375)
  -- -- -- -------

The relevant information information of the system is hidden in the
diagonal elements of the spectral function @xmath . Now, we use the
definitions for @xmath given by Eqs. ( 370 ) and then trace over Nambu
space,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (376)
  -- -------- -- -------

or

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (377)
  -- -------- -- -------

Previous equation can be rewritten in a more elegant way, since the
Fermi distribution functions can be factored out,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (378)
  -- -------- -- -------

and by taking into account that the hopping matrix @xmath is real, one
has

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (379)
  -- -------- -- -------

One can also seek for a relation between @xmath and @xmath . Since the
spectral function is computed numerically by using the retarded and
advanced Green’s functions of the leads, the structure of such Green’s
functions allows us to relate the @xmath and @xmath . Thus one has,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (380)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then, Eq. ( 379 ), introducing the limits of integration, reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (381)
  -- -------- -- -------

Notice that previous integral contains a term whose argument is @xmath .
Then, we make the substitution @xmath . The distribution functions reads

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Previous considerations lead to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (382)
  -- -------- -- -------

Assuming that @xmath , one gets

  -- -- -- -------
           (383)
  -- -- -- -------

One can make a change of variable in the third integral in previous
equation, @xmath , then one has that the third term is the conjugated of
the first one,

  -- -- -- -------
           (384)
  -- -- -- -------

Notice that the last two integrals of previous equation should vanish
due to symmetry considerations. Let us check it in for the terms @xmath
, since this corresponds to the electron spectral function. The
conclusion holds also for previous equation. One has,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (385)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the first integral the term @xmath is on the interval @xmath , then
the fourth integral vanish on the interval @xmath . The same analysis
can be done between the second and third terms. See Fig. 93 for more
details.

Therefore, the terms that survive are only the first and the third.
Similar considerations led to the conclusion of vanishing the last two
terms in Eq. ( 384 ). Therefore, one has

  -- -- -- -------
           (386)
  -- -- -- -------

where in the first integral we made a change of variable, @xmath . The
frequency can now take any arbitrary value, so that the integral limits
change. Then the current in the tunnel limit reads,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (387)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the trace in previous expression is taken over the spin space. The
coupling across the junction is modelled by the hopping matrix @xmath
between the end sites of each wire, where @xmath is the dimensionless
tunneling parameter that controls the junction’s normal transparency.

Thus, it was possible to calculate the @xmath current explicitly in the
tunnelling limit, where to leading (second) order in the left-right
coupling @xmath , Eq. ( 352 ) reduces, after some algebra, to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (388)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the particle-particle Nambu @xmath matrix block of the
spectral function of the @xmath decoupled wire,

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

and the trace is taken over spin space. The trace of @xmath is
proportional to the local density of states. Fig. 94 shows results for
the tunnel current using Eq. 388 for increasing Zeeman fields. Overall,
the agreement with the full numerics in Fig. 49 (a) is very good and,
importantly, all the relevant features such as, e. g., the closing of
the gap, are captured by this tunneling approximation.

## Appendix H Andreev approximation

It is conventional, in the study of hybrid superconducting-normal
junctions, to assume the limit in which the Fermi energy @xmath of the
metal under consideration is much greater than the superconducting gap,
and any other energy @xmath involved in the problem, @xmath . This is
known as the Andreev approximation. In essence, it allows one to regard
the normal system as featureless, with constant Fermi velocity and
density of states. In this case, a number of simplifications can be
carried out in the computation of equilibrium transport properties. One
important consequence of the approximation in the context of our work is
that, in a short SNS junction with phase difference @xmath , and
symmetric under time-reversal symmetry ( @xmath in our case), two
degenerate Andreev states will appear of energy @xmath [ 144 ] . This
immediately implies that at perfect normal transparency @xmath , the
ABSs will reach zero energy at @xmath . In other words, in the Andreev
approximation the ABS energy minimum in the non-topological phase will
be @xmath .

While in the topological phase, a zero @xmath is a robust property,
protected by parity conservation, a @xmath in the non-topological phase
is accidental, a direct consequence of the Andreev approximation, and is
not protected by any symmetry. In fact, any deviation from the Andreev
approximation will induce a finite splitting @xmath . In semiconducting
nanowires such as the ones considered in this work, this correction is
very relevant. Indeed, for the nanowire to undergo a superconducting
topological transition at a reasonable Zeeman field @xmath , @xmath must
remain relatively small (the wire must be close to depletion, and far
from the Andreev approximation), otherwise the critical field @xmath
would be physically unreachable. The splitting @xmath , therefore,
remains a relevant quantity in the formation and detection of Majorana
bound states.

The value of @xmath in our system may be computed numerically. The most
efficient way is to consider a short SNS junction with finite length
superconductors, @xmath , @xmath and a phase difference @xmath . Since
this system is closed, an exact diagonalization of the tight-binding
Nambu Hamiltonian yields a minimum eigenvalue that is exactly @xmath if
the S leads are long enough (longer than the coherence length). We find
that this quantity is finite in the case of wires close to depletion,
@xmath , and that it vanishes as one approaches the Andreev
approximation regime @xmath , see Fig. 95 . More specifically, we have
found that @xmath scales as @xmath for some @xmath , within very good
precision.

## Chapter \thechapter Appendix for Chapter Hybrid
superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful platforms to
study Majorana bound states

In this part we provide some additional technical aspects used in
Chapter Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful
platforms to study Majorana bound states . We make a full proximity
model in order to justify our calculations within the simplified model
description. Moreover, we perform an effective model for the normal
conductance, where we aim at describing the physics of Fano resonances
in the first part of Chapter Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor
nanowire junctions as useful platforms to study Majorana bound states .
At the end, the Majorana localization length is calculated.

## Appendix I Induced superconducting pairing

A more realistic model when considering the proximity effect consists on
the following description. The full NW is divided in three sections: a
central normal region (N) and two normal regions (M). See Fig. 96 . Each
of the M sections describe NW regions coupled to a superconductor which,
to distinguish from the previous notation, we denote as S’. As opposed
to the previous subsection, the full NW is now a normal system and the
proximity effect comes now from the tunneling coupling between the
superconductors and the M normal parts of the NW.

In this case, the full (normal) system is described by the following
Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (389)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a normal region of the same dimension as the
superconducting one @xmath ’ and @xmath is a diagonal matrix in site
space that couples the superconductor @xmath with the normal lead @xmath
. This coupling can be parametrized by the parameter @xmath . Then, we
introduce the he superconducting pairing, which is written in the same
basis as @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (390)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath with @xmath describe the bulk s-wave superconducting leads.
In a similar way as the one described in Section 10.4 , we write the
full system Hamiltonian in Nambu space as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (391)
  -- -------- -- -------

As described in the main text, the approximate description of the
proximity effect given in Section 10.4 is a good approximation provided
that we are in a large gap limit and that the contact transparency is
good. We have benchmarked the approximate solution given in Section 10.4
against the full proximity model, given here, in various relevant cases
and always found good agreement in the correct parameter range. Now, we
illustrate this point by showing a calculation using the full proximity
effect model of Eq. 389 instead of the approximate model given by Eq. (
389 ) and fully described in Section 10.4 .

In Fig. 97 we show results corresponding to the same physical situation
we presented in Fig. 61 c in the main text, the only difference being
that the bulk gap in @xmath is much larger than the induced gap used in
the calculations of Fig. 61 c ( @xmath ). The overall behaviour of the
subgap states in Fig. 97 is the same as in Fig. 61 c (including the
loops in the helical region described in the main text), demonstrating
that the simplified model is indeed justified when the bulk gap is the
largest energy scale. Importantly, note the rescaled @xmath axis which
explicitly shows that the relevant energy scale is not the original bulk
gap included in the calculation but the smaller value @xmath , in
agreement with our previous claim.

## Appendix J Effective model for the conductance

In this part we make use of an effective model to describe the physics
of Fano resonances. An effective spinless model based on Green’s
functions is constructed where two semi-infinite tight-binding chains
(leads) are coupled through @xmath to a central region @xmath , formed
by one site, that is additionally weakly coupled through @xmath to a
resonant level @xmath , being @xmath a fixed parameter that represents
the separation between the quantum dot level and the resonant level (in
principle this parameter mimics the role of the Zeeman splitting in our
numerics) (see Fig. 98 ). Consider that @xmath is the lattice constant
and @xmath the hopping between sites in the leads. The normal
transmission, @xmath , through a central system formed by one site can
be calculated by using the Caroli’s formula,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (392)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the retarded full system Green’s function, and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (393)
  -- -------- -- -------

takes into account the influence of the leads on the central system
through the left(right) L(R) self-energies @xmath .

The full system Green’s function can be calculated by using the Dyson’s
relation,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (394)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the retarded Green’s function of the isolated central
region (this central region can for instance be a quantum dot) without
the influence of the leads and without the influence of the resonant
level. It reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (395)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the onsite energy of the central region.

The self-energy @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (396)
  -- -------- -- -------

contain the effect of the left @xmath and right @xmath leads as well as
the influence of the resonant level @xmath , respectively. Such
self-energies are defined as follows,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (397)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the retarded semi-infinite left (right) lead Green’s
functions. In principle such lead’s Green’s functions can be computed
considering a recursive approach,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (398)
  -- -------- -- -------

@xmath is the onsite energy in the leads. From previous equation one
has,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (399)
  -- -------- -- -------

therefore,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (400)
  -- -------- -- -------

Adding a convergence factor to frequency, @xmath , one finds the
retarded or advanced Green’s function.We have the following properties
of @xmath , {widetext}

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (401)
  -- -------- -- -------

where for the first case the density of states @xmath is zero, while in
the second case it exhibits a non zero value. These results allow us to
obtain @xmath . The impurity self-energy @xmath reads,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (402)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the coupling of the resonant level to the system. With
these expressions for the different self-energies, we may compute @xmath
,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (403)
  -- -------- -- -------

The normal conductance @xmath is calculated from the transmission as,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (404)
  -- -------- -- -------

where by construction we have already in a spinless channel. Since we
are interested in low temperature physics, @xmath , and @xmath .
Therefore,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (405)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the Fermi energy which is the zero of energy in our
calculations.

The aim of this part was to construct an effective model that contains
the physics of our numerics, where the transmission (and conductance)
develops a resonance in the trivial phase and a dip in the helical
phase. Indeed, by plugging previous equations in the expression for the
transmission and conductance, one ends up with the desired result that
is plotted in Fig. 99 .

In such plots, we consider a strong hopping @xmath between sites in the
leads in comparison to the couplings @xmath and @xmath . For weak
coupling between leads and the central region a resonant tunnelling peak
is obtained at the energy of the central region @xmath . Upon increasing
the coupling between the leads and the central region @xmath the
resonant peak at @xmath becomes broader and a sharp Fano feature emerges
at the resonant impurity @xmath . The new feature has the typical Fano
structure of a zero followed by a peak, and arises from the interference
of the two possible paths for the carriers, through the very broadened
(strongly coupled) site at @xmath , and through the weakly coupled
resonant level at @xmath . For strong enough coupling @xmath , the
@xmath contributes with a uniform @xmath background to conductance,
while the Fano feature becomes a pure dip to zero.

In conclusion, we have developed an effective model that contains the
physics involved in our numerics where a resonance peak is present at
the energy of the quantum dot for weakly coupled system. By increasing
the coupling of the quantum dot to the leads a Fano feature (dip to zero
followed by a peak) appears in conductance at the energy of the resonant
level.

## Appendix K Majorana localization length

The calculation of the Majorana localization length @xmath is carried
out by solving the polynomial equation for the wave vector @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (406)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath . Previous equation was derived in Ref. [ 61 ] .
We numerically solve Eq. ( 406 ), and then we look for real solutions
@xmath . What we define as the Majorana localisation length is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (407)
  -- -------- -- -------

Indeed, in Fig. 100 one observes that @xmath linearly increases as one
increases @xmath for realistic SOC (dashed line), while it acquires
smaller values and remains roughly constant for stronger SOC (solid
curve).

## Chapter \thechapter Appendix for Chapter Hybrid
superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful platforms to
study Majorana bound states

In this supplemental material we discuss the robustness of the
exceptional-point Majorana bound states presented in the main text
against finite length and interaction effects.

## Appendix L Methods

Transport across the NS junction is computed using the nanowire model
for a Rashba wire,

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

with the non-proximized normal section (N) modelled by the same
Hamiltonian, albeit with @xmath and a @xmath in place of @xmath . The
normal contact transmission @xmath of each incoming mode is computed by
also setting @xmath on the proximised (S) side, and using the standard
Green’s function scheme. One first splits the system into a left lead
(with @xmath ), a right lead (with @xmath ), and a central section (the
interface with a non-uniform profile @xmath that transitions from @xmath
into @xmath ) coupled to the leads through operators @xmath . The total
conductance @xmath of the @xmath incoming modes is then given by
Caroli’s formula [ 229 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (409)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , @xmath is the dressed retarded Green’s function of the
central region, @xmath is the decay operator into the left/right leads,
@xmath is the corresponding self energies, and @xmath is the surface
Green’s function of the decoupled leads.

The poles of the scattering matrix presented in the main text are given,
close to the origin of the complex plane, by the eigenvalues of
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian @xmath , where @xmath is the (Hermitian)
Hamiltonian of a sufficiently long segment of the wire containing the
junction, and @xmath is the self-energy from the remaining wire (the
reservoir), which is computed numerically.

The average normal transmission per mode is defined as @xmath . The
values given in the main text were computed for Zeeman @xmath . @xmath
depends on the detailed spatial interpolation profile @xmath across the
interface. An abrupt interface has a smaller transmission than a smooth
one, due to the mismatch in Fermi velocity between the two sides. In a
real sample, the smoothness of such depletion profile is controlled by
geometric parameters of the gating used to deplete the normal side
(typically the superconducting side will be difficult to deplete due to
screening by the parent superconductor). @xmath can also be controlled
in a real device by adding a pinch-off gate close to the contact. This
possibility is modelled by suppressing a single hopping term @xmath
precisely at the contact, where @xmath abruptly jumps from zero to
@xmath . The combination of mismatch and pinch-off allows to sweep
@xmath from zero to one.

## Chapter \thechapter Appendix for Chapter Hybrid
superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions as useful platforms to
study Majorana bound states

In this supplementary material we show how the density-density response
function for Rashba nanowires was derived. Then, we describe how the
Bogoliubov transformation in a superconducting system was carried out in
order to calculate the density-density response function, which is also
shown here when the interband pairing is set to zero.

## Appendix M Derivation of the density response in Rashba nanowires

We introduce the equations for the electron density operator, given by
Eqs. ( 150 ), into the average of the commutator given by Eq. ( 147 ),
and get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (410)
  -- -------- -- -------

Previous equation is rewritten introducing the expressions for the wave
functions @xmath from Eq. ( 121 ),

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (411)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now, we work out the average of the commutator

  -- -- -- -------
           (412)
  -- -- -- -------

where @xmath is the Fermi distribution function, @xmath the Boltzman
constant and @xmath the system temperature. Then, we insert Eq. ( 412 )
expression into Eq. ( 411 ), and obtain

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (413)
  -- -------- -- -------

The term at the end of previous expression arises from by combined
action between the spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman interaction, which can
be written from the definition for @xmath given by Eq. ( 121 ), as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (414)
  -- -------- -- -------

The next step is integration over time @xmath and over position @xmath ,
of Eq. ( 413 ) according to Eq. ( 146 ) Hence, we obtain

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (415)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we have relabeled @xmath , @xmath , @xmath . The imaginary part of
Eq. ( 415 ) gives the structure factor, and notice that we have obtained
the same as the one calculated in [ 230 ] , which provides a validity
check for our calculations.

In the static limit, for @xmath , the Lindhard function (or
density-density response function) @xmath calculate before is purely
real and is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (416)
  -- -------- -- -------

Notice that the principal part prescription required by the
infinitesimal @xmath in the denominator of previous equation is not
needed here, since the denominator can only vanish simultaneously with
the numerator. In the limit @xmath , we have replaced the discrete sum
over momentum by an integral

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (417)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the dimension.

For higher dimensions one needs to calculate the electronic wave
functions of the problem with Rashba SO and Zeeman in the desirable
dimension and repite all what the steps we have done.

At zero temperature @xmath , the Fermi distribution function @xmath
becomes a step function

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (418)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (419)
  -- -------- -- -------

Notice that at zero temperature the chemical potential is equal to the
Fermi energy @xmath . The function @xmath restricts the @xmath
integration to interval @xmath , with @xmath defined by Eq. ( 419 )
@xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (420)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . From Eq. ( 416 ), the full
density-density response can be expressed as a sum of four terms

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (421)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (422)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (423)
  -- -------- -- -------

For a simplification upon integration let us divide each of the @xmath
into two integrals as follows

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (424)
  -- -------- -- -------

We know that at zero temperature, the distribution functions become step
functions and thus restrict the integration limits,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (425)
  -- -------- -- -------

To conclude, in this part we have shown how to derive the
density-density response function in one-dimensional nanowires with SOC
and Zeeman interaction.

## Appendix N Derivation of the density response in superconducting
Rashba nanowires

In this part we derive the density-density response function in
superconducting nanowires with SOC and Zeeman interaction. First, we
show how it is found the Bogoliubov transformation as it determines the
inclusion of superconducting correlations into the nanowires. Then, we
find the density-density response function for a superconducting 1D
nanowire when the interband pairing is set to zero, and then in a regime
of strong Zeeman field, where only the lower band @xmath is taken into
account.

#### n.1 Derivation of the Bogoliubov transformation at zero interband
pairing

In this part we show how to derive the Bogoliubov transformation when
superconducting correlations are induced into the nanowire. This
transformation consists on finding an unitary operator that diagonalises
the system’s Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian for our problem in the helical
basis described in Secs. 5 and C , see Eq. ( 49 ) for instance, is

  -- -- -- -------
           (426)
  -- -- -- -------

where the pairing potentials involved in the problem are

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (427)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (428)
  -- -------- -- -------

denotes the @xmath -wave and @xmath -wave nature of the superconducting
pairing, respectively.

Notice that the intraband pairing @xmath contains a phase, which is
represented by the imaginary @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (429)
  -- -------- -- -------

This phase can be gauge away by considering the eigenvalue problem
@xmath , where, @xmath being the transpose operation,

  -- -- -- -------
           (430)
  -- -- -- -------

then

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (431)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, previous equations can be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (432)
  -- -------- -- -------

Thus, we have gauged away the phase in the intraband pairing potentials.
Notice that the dispersion relation we have derived in previous section
is not affected by this gauge transformation. We point out here that
@xmath and @xmath represent the pairing potentials of two @xmath -wave
superconductors, while @xmath acts as a weak coupling between them, see
Sec. ( 5 ).

The situation when there is no pairing between states of different band
is analysed here and described by setting @xmath . This case resemble a
regime with two independent p-wave superconductors described by the two
@xmath -wave pairing potentials @xmath and @xmath . The eigenvalues in
this case are calculated by diagonalising the Hamiltonian given by Eq. (
426 )

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (433)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then, Eqs. 432 are written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (434)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the first and third equations form the Hamiltonian for sector
@xmath , while second and fourth for sector @xmath . Previous four
equations reduce to only two equations

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (435)
  -- -------- -- -------

which can be solved separately, since the two sectors are completely
decoupled. Remain that the coupling between the sectors @xmath and
@xmath is described by @xmath , whose value is set to zero for
simplicity.

##### Sector 1: @xmath

From Eqs. ( 435 ), we have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (436)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the energy relation is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (437)
  -- -------- -- -------

Moreover, we have the normalization condition

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (438)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then, we insert previous equation into Eq. ( 436 )

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (439)
  -- -------- -- -------

thus

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (440)
  -- -------- -- -------

We can completely neglect the @xmath function, but for completeness we
keep it for now. However, we will show that it won’t alter our results.
Now, we need to evaluate previous coherence factors for each energy
given by Eq. ( 437 ).
(a): For @xmath
From Eq. ( 440 ), we have for @xmath and @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (441)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now, we denote previous results as follows

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (442)
  -- -------- -- -------

The associated vector is therefore

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (443)
  -- -------- -- -------

(b): For @xmath
From Eq. ( 440 ) we have for @xmath and @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (444)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now, in terms of previous definitions @xmath and @xmath given by Eqs. (
442 ) we can write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (445)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then, the associated vector is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (446)
  -- -------- -- -------

The Bogoliubov transformation
This transformation consists on finding an unitary operator that
diagonalises the Hamiltonian for this sector and formed by the first and
third equations given by ( 434 ). Such unitary operator is a matrix and
it is formed by the two vectors calculated previously. From Eqs. ( 446 )
and ( 443 ), we neglect the @xmath function, we have

  -- -- -- -------
           (447)
  -- -- -- -------

This matrix relates the basis, represented by operators @xmath , in
which the Hamiltonian is not diagonal with a new one, represented by
operators @xmath , where it is diagonal. This new basis is the one of
quasiparticles in a superconductor:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (448)
  -- -------- -- -------

therefore, the Bogolyubov transformation for operators that belong to
the sector @xmath are given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (449)
  -- -------- -- -------

Moreover, the matrix @xmath , @xmath denotes the transpose operation,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (450)
  -- -------- -- -------

also diagonalises the Hamiltonian for the sector @xmath , and therefore
it can also apply for transforming the operators:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (451)
  -- -------- -- -------

##### Sector 2:@xmath

From Eqs. ( 435 ), we have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (452)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the energy relation is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (453)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the normalization condition is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (454)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then, we insert Eq. ( 452 ) into previous equation and get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (455)
  -- -------- -- -------

Thus,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (456)
  -- -------- -- -------

(a): For @xmath
From Eq. ( 452 ) for @xmath we have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (457)
  -- -------- -- -------

Again, here we make the following notation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (458)
  -- -------- -- -------

Thus, the associated vector is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (459)
  -- -------- -- -------

(b): For @xmath
From Eq. ( 452 ) we have for @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (460)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, these coherence factors in terms of previous definitions
@xmath and @xmath , we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (461)
  -- -------- -- -------

Thus, the associated vector is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (462)
  -- -------- -- -------

The Bogoliubov transformation
Here we construct the unitary operator that diagonalizes the Hamiltonian
of this sector @xmath . It is formed by the two vectors given by Eqs. (
459 ) and ( 462 )calculated previously:

  -- -- -- -------
           (463)
  -- -- -- -------

As before, this matrix relates the basis, represented by operators
@xmath , in which the Hamiltonian is not diagonal to a new one,
represented by operators @xmath , where it is diagonal. This new basis
is the one of quasiparticles in a superconductor:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (464)
  -- -------- -- -------

therefore, the Bogoliubov transformation for operators that belong to
the sector @xmath are given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (465)
  -- -------- -- -------

As explained before, the matrix @xmath , @xmath denotes the transpose
operation,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (466)
  -- -------- -- -------

diagonalises our Hamiltonian, and therefore it can also apply for
transforming the operators @xmath into the new basis @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (467)
  -- -------- -- -------

Notice that upon writing the transformations we have omitted the term
@xmath . It, however, won’t alter our results.

##### The Bogoliubov transformation from previous calculations

Therefore, for transforming operators @xmath into the new basis @xmath
we can use

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (468)
  -- -------- -- -------

or the ones related to the transpose of @xmath , @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (469)
  -- -------- -- -------

Comment 1: For calculating the density response, we can use either
Eqs. ( 468 ) or Eqs. ( 469 ), since both diagonalize the respective
Hamiltonian for each sector.

#### Density density response at zero interband pairing

The density-density response function is defined in Eq. ( 164 ), where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (470)
  -- -------- -- -------

and we here define

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (471)
  -- -------- -- -------

According to the description given in the main text, one writes the
electron density operator in terms of field operators, see Eqs. ( 166 ),
which are constructed taking into account the one-electron wave
functions given by Eq. ( 168 ). Then, we insert Eqs. ( 166 ) into Eq. (
471 ), and get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (472)
  -- -------- -- -------

and therefore

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (473)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we have summed over @xmath . There are @xmath terms to be
calculated. We need the Bogolyubov transformation to describe
excitations in a superconductor, which was derived in previous
subsection in Eqs. ( 469 ),

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (474)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (475)
  -- -------- -- -------

and @xmath , @xmath , @xmath .

By working out all the elements, at zero temperature @xmath , @xmath ,
we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (476)
  -- -------- -- -------

The frequency dependence is calculated by integrating previous
expression in time @xmath . Moreover, the coefficients coming from the
Rashba-SO problem in Eq. ( 476 ), the terms with @xmath , give only two
different values that we denote as

  -- -- -- -------
           (477)
  -- -- -- -------

After the integration and considering previous definitions we arrive at

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (478)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now, we take the zero frequency limit and consider @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath . Thus, previous equation can be written as

  -- -- -- -------
           (479)
  -- -- -- -------

Let us denote the term in brackets as @xmath . The momentum dependence
is calculated as by integrating over space @xmath . Then,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (480)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (481)
  -- -------- -- -------

where coherence factors read

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (482)
  -- -------- -- -------

#### n.2 Regime of strong Zeeman field

In this part we address the situation of high Zeeman field @xmath . In
this case, only the lowest band, @xmath , is occupied. Therefore, the
full Hamiltonian can be projected to the lowest band yielding

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (483)
  -- -------- -- -------

The Hamiltonian @xmath can be written in the BdG form in the @xmath
basis,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (484)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (485)
  -- -------- -- -------

The eigenvalues are given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (486)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here we proceed similarly to previous subsection in order to calculate
the density-density response function. The response function in momentum
and frequency space is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (487)
  -- -------- -- -------

where, @xmath ,

  -- -- -- -------
           (488)
  -- -- -- -------

and @xmath is the electron density operator. According to the
description given in the main text, one writes the electron density
operator in terms of field operators, see Eqs. ( 166 ), which are
constructed taking into account the one-electron wave functions given by
Eq. ( 168 ). Then, we insert Eqs. ( 166 ) into Eq. ( 488 ), and get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (489)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now, we assume the situation of high Zeeman field, where only the lowest
band, @xmath , is occupied. Therefore, in Eq. ( 489 ) the unique
combination that we need is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (490)
  -- -------- -- -------

In order to describe the system with superconducting effects, we need to
transform our @xmath operators in Eq. ( 490 ) into the new ones @xmath
according to the Bogoliubov transformation given by Eqs. ( 468 ) or (
469 ), where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (491)
  -- -------- -- -------

Let us define the following quantity

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (492)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, in terms of the new quasiparticle operators @xmath , we get

  -- -- -- -------
           (493)
  -- -- -- -------

Then, we can work out the average of the commutators in previous
equation, consider the time evolution of the operators, @xmath , and
obtain for Eq. ( 490 ),

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (494)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now, we integrate over time and evaluate the zero temperature limit,
where @xmath , and thus @xmath . Therefore, previous equation reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (495)
  -- -------- -- -------

We can further simplify previous equation by considering the zero
frequency limit @xmath . The coefficients from the Rashba-Zeeman fields
reads

  -- -- -- -------
           (496)
  -- -- -- -------

Then, from the relations for the coherence factors @xmath and @xmath and
for the dispersion relation @xmath , we have that @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath . Additionally, t Therefore, taking into account previous
comments, the density density response reads,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (497)
  -- -------- -- -------

Moreover, we can write the momentum dependence of the density-density
response

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (498)
  -- -------- -- -------

Thus, we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (499)
  -- -------- -- -------

Previous equation represents the density-density response function in a
1D superconducting wire with Rashba and Zeeman interaction with only the
lowest band occupied, also known as the Lindhard function. Previous
equation is valid for high Zeeman fields @xmath . Let us write down the
coherence coefficient in Eq. ( 499 ),

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (500)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we have denoted

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (501)
  -- -------- -- -------

As in previous subsection, sum over @xmath in Eq. ( 499 ) is transformed
into an integral over @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (502)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the integral is performed numerically.
