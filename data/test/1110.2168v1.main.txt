##### Acknowledgements. Writing this thesis has been the hardest thing
I have ever done; over the course of the last few years my self-esteem
and sense of self-worth have plummeted, and I could not have finished
without the support of a great number of people. To all of them I give
my heartfelt thanks, but in particular I would like to acknowledge:

-   my supervisor, Mark Wardle, who is brilliant and funny and has
    always supported me, even when he was overburdened with too many PhD
    students to supervise and theses to read. You inspire me, and if I
    continue on this path it will be thanks to you.

-   Gemma and James, for all the hugs, tears and unconditional love, as
    well as the gifts of backup drives. You make me a better person;
    when times were rocky you were there for me and I love you both.

-   Korinne, Sarah and Anna, the best PhD buddies and officemates anyone
    could ask for. Thanks for the songs, the cupcakes, the hugs, and
    making it through to the end with me — I’m proud of all of us.

-   Korinne again, because she proofread this beast twice. Thanks, crazy
    lady.

    and Drew; the West Ryde knitters; and all the other friends, online
    and off, who have listened to my rants and offered sympathy as
    needed. May all of you continue to be awesome.

  “It seems to me, that if the matter of our sun and planets, and all
  the matter of the universe, were evenly scattered throughout all the
  heavens, and every particle had an innate gravity towards all the
  rest, and the whole space throughout which this matter was scattered,
  was finite, the matter on the outside of this space would by its
  gravity tend towards the matter on the inside, and by consequence fall
  down into the middle of the whole space, and there compose one great
  spherical mass. But if the matter were evenly disposed throughout an
  infinite space, it could never convene into one mass; but some of it
  would convene into one mass and some into another, so as to make an
  infinite number of great masses, scattered great distances from one to
  another throughout all that infinite space. And thus might the sun and
  fixed stars be formed, supposing the matter were of a lucid nature.”

- Newton to Bentley (December 10, 1692), quoted by Jeans ( 1928 )

## Chapter 1 Star Formation

In the seventeenth century Sir Isaac Newton pondered gravity’s influence
on the formation of stars and planets and the consequences of such star
formation on an unbounded interstellar medium (Newton to Bentley,
December 10, 1692; as quoted by Jeans, 1928 ) . His assertion that the
gradual growth of inhomogeneities in the material that forms stars could
lead to runaway gravitational collapse remains at the heart of star
formation theory today, and it is from this basic description that our
modern understanding of star formation by the gravitational condensation
of diffuse matter in space under the influence of rotational and
magnetic effects has evolved.

Understanding star formation is critical to our understanding of the
universe, as stars are the fundamental objects of astronomy. Star
formation determines the structure, evolution and luminosity of galaxies
(e.g. Freeman and Bland-Hawthorn, 2002 ) ; planet formation and
evolution occurs in protoplanetary discs as a result of the star
formation process (Safronov, 1967 ) and most of the elements that are
not hydrogen are made in stars (Hoyle, 1946 ) — so it is no surprise
that the intricacies of star formation are the focus of many studies in
astronomy. The questions surrounding how molecular clouds are formed and
supported against gravity (e.g. Tasker and Tan, 2009 ) ; what triggers
their collapse (e.g. Chandrasekhar and Fermi, 1953 ; Field, 1978 ;
Norman and Silk, 1980 ) ; the detailed dynamics of the collapse
throughout the different stages of the star formation process (e.g.
Larson, 1969 ; Penston, 1969 ; Shu, 1977 ; Terebey et al., 1984 ; Shu
et al., 1987 ; Stahler and Palla, 2004 ; McKee and Ostriker, 2007 ) and
the importance of the magnetic field and the angular momentum of the
initial cloud in determining the final properties of the protostar and
its protostellar disc (e.g. Mestel and Spitzer, 1956 ; Strittmatter,
1966 ; Basu, 1998 ; Dapp and Basu, 2010 ) are of vital importance to our
understanding of the universe.

In the last fifty years the increasing availability of computers and
numerical techniques enabled astronomers to simulate gravitational
collapse and star formation with increasing resolution and complexity
(Klessen et al., 2011 ; Machida, 2011 ) , while observations at infrared
and radio wavelengths have started to unveil the physical processes at
work in the molecular cloud cores from which stars form and determine
the characteristics that distinguish the youngest stars from their host
clouds (e.g. di Francesco et al., 2007 ; Ward-Thompson et al., 2007 ) .
Both theoretical and observational studies of star formation have
gradually converged on the consensus theories that low-mass stars form
as a result of the gravitational collapse of dense molecular cloud
cores, while higher mass stars form under the influence of more
complicated processes, such as the fragmentation of molecular cloud
clumps, the merger of smaller stars, and turbulent motions within the
molecular clouds (e.g. Basu and Ciolek, 2004 ; Mac Low and Klessen, 2004
; Ballesteros-Paredes et al., 2007 ) .

In the “standard model” of star formation proposed by Shu et al. ( 1987
) it is assumed that magnetic fields and thermal pressure initially
provide pressure support against gravity in these molecular cloud cores
and carry away excess angular momentum; however, as the gas is weakly
ionised it is not in a strictly-steady state and gradually contracts.
The neutral molecules are pulled inwards by gravity and drift inward
through the magnetic field (which is supported by ions) in the process
of ambipolar diffusion (Spitzer, 1978 ) . Once the density is high
enough that the magnetic field is no longer able to support the core, it
dynamically collapses to form a protostar, usually (although not always)
surrounded by a protostellar disc from which it accretes further mass.
The protostar quickly comes to gravitationally dominate a progressively
larger region of the molecular cloud in which it has formed (Shu et al.,
1987 ) .

This introductory chapter outlines the previous research and current
theories of primarily low-mass star formation, to motivate the research
into the influence of Hall diffusion on the dynamics of gravitational
collapse and accretion disc physics that is described within the rest of
this thesis. The properties of molecular clouds and the star forming
cores within them are described first, to provide an overview of the
initial conditions of collapse, followed by a brief description of Hall
magnetohydrodynamics, emphasising the importance of magnetic field
diffusion on the dynamics of weakly ionised gases such as those found in
molecular clouds.

The current state of gravitational collapse studies is then explored
across several stages of the star formation process, with particular
focus on the effects of rotation and the magnetic field on the
collapsing core. The current major problem of star formation simulations
— the “magnetic braking catastrophe”, in which all of the angular
momentum is removed from the collapsing core by magnetic braking — is
outlined, along with recent approaches towards solving this problem and
predictions for how Hall magnetohydrodynamics shall affect the magnetic
braking behaviour in the flow. Finally, an overview of the thesis, its
aims and primary results shall be presented with reference to existing
theories of star formation. Should readers wish for more detailed
information on the current state of star formation research than is
presented in this chapter, they are directed to the thorough reviews by
McKee and Ostriker ( 2007 ) and Machida ( 2011 ) , and the references
cited therein.

### 1.1 Molecular Clouds

Stars form in molecular clouds, generally dark regions of the
interstellar medium in which the density and temperature of the gas
permit the formation of molecules. The gas is primarily composed of
molecular hydrogen, which is difficult to detect observationally, and so
the gas is traced and the mass inferred from its luminosity in the
@xmath line of @xmath CO or @xmath CO, which are the dominant
carbon-bearing species (Langer et al., 2000 ) .

Giant molecular clouds make up most of the mass of the interstellar
medium; they have masses @xmath – @xmath M @xmath , diameters @xmath –
@xmath pc and volume-averaged number densities of @xmath – @xmath cm
@xmath (André et al., 2000 ; Williams et al., 2000 ; di Francesco
et al., 2007 , and the references within these) . They are in general
not gravitationally bound (Dobbs et al., 2011 ) , and are surrounded by
a layer of less dense atomic gas which shields the molecules from the
interstellar UV radiation field that is capable of dissociating
molecules and leads to a low rate of heating by external radiation
(Elmegreen, 1993 ) . Giant molecular clouds may contain several sites of
star formation, and while smaller molecular clouds with masses @xmath M
@xmath may also form stars, their contribution to the total star
formation rate in the Galaxy is negligible (Magnani et al., 1995 ) .

Molecular clouds have a hierarchical structure and the terminology used
to describe the differently-scaled features varies across papers; the
conventions outlined in McKee and Ostriker ( 2007 ) are followed here.
Overdense coherent regions in @xmath - @xmath - @xmath (galactic
longitude, galactic latitude and radial velocity) space identified from
spectral line maps of molecular emission within molecular clouds are
referred to as clumps . Cluster-forming clumps are the massive clumps
out of which stellar clusters form; they are gravitationally bound or
bound by the pressure of the interclump medium even though most clusters
are unbound (Williams et al., 1995 ) . Molecular cloud cores are the
particularly dense self-gravitating regions out of which single stars
(or small multiple systems such as binaries) form. Not all of the
material that goes into forming a star must come from the core — some
may be accreted from the surrounding clump or cloud as the protostar
moves through it (Bonnell et al., 1997 ) . The physical properties of
molecular clouds, clumps and cores are summarised in Table 1.1 (from
Klessen et al., 2011 ) .

Molecular cloud cores that form single or binary low-mass stars (as
opposed to clumps that form clusters and very massive stars) such as
those in the Taurus, Orion and Ophiuchus molecular clouds have typical
diameters @xmath pc, number densities @xmath cm @xmath and masses
ranging from a fraction of a solar mass to @xmath M @xmath , although
the masses can be uncertain by a factor of @xmath due to uncertainties
in the measured distance, dust opacity, molecular abundances and
calibration (di Francesco et al., 2007 ) . The core morphologies depend
on the intensity level chosen to mark the boundary between the core and
the host cloud, as well as the wavelength range and angular resolution
of the observations. In general, cores that are round (in projection
against the sky) are interpreted as being spherical in shape, while
cores that are elongated (again, in projection) are typically
interpreted as being either oblate or prolate spheroids; statistical
analyses have shown that most isolated cores are oblate rather than
prolate (Jones et al., 2001 ; Jones and Basu, 2002 , in contrast with
the results of Ryden (1996) who assumed axisymmetry in their analysis) ;
and that starless cores have more extreme axial ratios than protostellar
cores (cores in which a protostar has formed; Goodwin et al., 2002 ) .

Mappings of molecular cloud cores show that they often display nonzero
initial infall velocities before they contain infrared sources
(protostars). Lee et al. ( 2001 ) mapped 53 targets and identified 19
candidate collapsing cores that demonstrated infall based upon the shape
of the CS lines and analysis of both the thick CS and the thin N @xmath
H @xmath peak velocities. They derived one-dimensional infall speeds for
these starless cores to obtain typical values of 0.05–0.09 km s @xmath ,
corresponding to mass infall rates of about 10 @xmath –10 @xmath M
@xmath yr @xmath . These observations were consistent with both of the
dominant models for the removal of support against gravity causing the
contraction of molecular cloud cores: ambipolar diffusion and
dissipation of turbulence theories (Fatuzzo et al., 2004 , these
theories shall be explored in detail in Section 1.3 ) .

Approximately 1% of the mass of a molecular cloud is in the form of dust
particles or grains, on which hydrogen molecules form by condensation
(Spitzer, 1978 ) . The rate at which this process occurs increases with
density, so that the abundance of molecules within the gas depends also
upon density (Larson, 2003 ) . The opacity of the dust shields the gas
from the UV radiation that would normally dissociate the molecules; the
continued existence of molecules requires that the host cloud possess a
column density of at least @xmath M @xmath pc @xmath (Elmegreen, 1993 )
. Typical molecular clouds are quite opaque and have column densities in
excess of @xmath M @xmath pc @xmath (see Table 1.1 ).

About half of the known interstellar molecular species have been
detected in the single core TMC-1 (Taurus Molecular Cloud-1; Ohishi and
Kaifu, 1998 ) . Surveys of isolated molecular cloud cores show that they
are chemically differentiated with NH @xmath and N @xmath H @xmath
dominant in the denser inner regions, and C @xmath S, CS and other
carbon-rich molecules more abundant in the diffuse outer regions (Kuiper
et al., 1996 ; Lada et al., 2003 ) ; the ratio of C @xmath S to N @xmath
H @xmath abundances has been proposed as an indicator of the time since
the gas was atomic carbon-rich (Bergin and Langer, 1997 ; Langer et al.,
2000 ) . In regions of massive star and cluster formation hot cores are
produced (in which the temperature is @xmath K); these may contain more
complex organic molecules such as CH @xmath OH, CH @xmath CH @xmath OH
and HCOOCH @xmath and typically have a large deuterium fraction (Kuiper
et al., 1996 ; Irvine, 1999 ) . The chemical differences observed
between regions of isolated and clustered star formation, such as the
presence of complex organic molecules, may (if retained in comets)
provide a way of tracing the formation conditions of the solar system
(Irvine, 1999 ) .

Molecular clouds are generally cold, with constant temperatures of
around @xmath K across a wide range of densities (e.g. Hayashi and
Nakano, 1965 ; Larson, 1985 ; Masunaga and Inutsuka, 2000 ) . In regions
of cluster formation compressional heating and radiative heating from
new stars can cause the temperature of individual cores to rise to 100 K
or higher, and when the density is particularly high the collapsing gas
becomes thermally-coupled to the dust; despite this the temperature of
cores typically remains constant so long as the density remains below
@xmath cm @xmath , above which radiative trapping occurs and the
temperature increases (e.g. Winkler and Newman, 1980 ; Wardle and
Königl, 1993 ; Ciolek and Königl, 1998 ) . This corresponds to the
formation of the “first” (opaque) core, which is followed later by
dynamic collapse to the “second” core (the protostar) once molecular
hydrogen dissociates (e.g. Larson, 1969 ) . The rate at which molecular
clouds are cooled by collisionally-excited atomic and molecular emission
processes is high — this emission primarily takes the form of
far-infrared radiation from molecules such as CO, which is the dominant
coolant in molecular clouds (McKee et al., 1982 ; Gilden, 1984 ) .

The near-constant low temperature across molecular clouds is an
important feature of the star formation process because of its influence
on the Jeans mass, and it is what makes possible the collapse of
prestellar cloud cores with masses as small as one solar mass (Larson,
2003 ) . The Jeans mass is the critical mass at which a cloud becomes
unstable and starts to collapse, as it possesses insufficient pressure
support to balance the force of gravity. It is given by the equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the density and @xmath is the mean atomic mass per
particle, which is usually taken to be @xmath in a fully molecular cloud
that is 25% Helium by mass and 10% by number (Jeans, 1928 ) . In the
absence of pressure or other support, gravitational collapse of such a
cloud will occur in a free fall time,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

(Spitzer, 1978 ) . For a cloud with typical temperature @xmath K and
density @xmath cm @xmath , the Jeans mass is @xmath M @xmath and the
free fall time is calculated to be @xmath years. This suggests that
molecular clouds are highly unstable; if thermal pressure support was
the only mechanism holding up molecular clouds then free fall collapse
would lead to a galactic star formation rate of @xmath M @xmath yr
@xmath , which is far in excess of the observed galactic average of
@xmath M @xmath yr @xmath .

Molecular clouds appear to have lifetimes of about @xmath – @xmath
years; longer lifetimes would imply that they cannot all be collapsing
at free fall speeds (as this would give a much higher observed star
formation rate) — in general, they must be supported by another
mechanism (Zuckerman and Palmer, 1974 ; Evans, 1999 ; André et al., 2000
; Ward-Thompson et al., 2007 ) . Various alternatives to thermal
pressure support of molecular clouds have been theorised: magnetic
fields (e.g. Chandrasekhar and Fermi, 1953 ; Basu and Mouschovias, 1994
; Adams and Shu, 2007 ) , rotation (e.g. Field, 1978 ; Evans, 1999 ) and
turbulence (e.g. Norman and Silk, 1980 ; Mac Low and Klessen, 2004 ;
Ballesteros-Paredes et al., 2007 ) . All of these likely contribute in
some measure, with magnetic fields the most important — without magnetic
fields it would be difficult to explain the generation of observed
levels of rotation and turbulence in molecular clouds.

The interstellar medium is strongly magnetised, and magnetic fields are
important to the dynamics and evolution of molecular clouds (McKee
et al., 1993 ) . The most useful measure of the magnetic field is the
Zeeman effect, which measures the line-of-sight component of the field,
as opposed to the Chandrasekhar-Fermi method which measures the
component of the field in the plane of the sky. The morphology of the
field is measured from dust polarisation and the linear polarisation of
spectral lines. The largest compilation of Zeeman measurements of the
magnetic field strengths in molecular clouds was performed by Crutcher (
1999 ) , who found that the median value of the Alfvén Mach number
across 27 clouds of varying mass was @xmath (although the observations
also found a median temperature of 40 K, which is much higher than the
average temperature typically measured in molecular clouds). From this
the median value of the magnetic field was calculated to be

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.3)

where @xmath cm @xmath and @xmath is the non-thermal velocity dispersion
of the cloud. @xmath is used as a measure of the amount of turbulence in
a volume, and is typically observed to be @xmath on large scales, where
@xmath (Goodman et al., 1998 ) .

Crutcher ( 1999 ) also found that the observed molecular cloud clumps
and cores were in approximate virial equilibrium, that is, that the
kinetic and magnetic energies were in approximate equipartition; this
implies that the gas motions must provide a significant component of the
support of molecular clouds against gravity. The gas velocities,
calculated by examining the Doppler-broadening of spectral linewidths,
were found to be supersonic (by about a factor of five) and
approximately equal to the Alfvén velocity, which suggests that the
internal motions in the gas were likely the result of
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves.

The average ratio of thermal to magnetic pressures across the 15 cores
for which such measurements were possible was found to be @xmath , where
@xmath implies that magnetic effects dominate thermal effects, showing
that magnetic fields are therefore very important to the physics of
molecular clouds (Crutcher, 1999 ) . These observations (as well as the
later ones by Crutcher and Troland, 2007 ; Crutcher et al., 2009 ) fit
the relation @xmath , which is consistent with simulations of molecular
clouds supported by the magnetic field, in particular ambipolar
diffusion of the field (where the flux is frozen into the ions, which
scale as @xmath ; this process is described in more detail in Section
1.2 ). However, this scaling is also expected from simulations of
turbulent motions that are constrained so that they are comparable to
the Alfvén velocity (Bertoldi and McKee, 1992 ; Fiedler and Mouschovias,
1993 ; Evans, 1999 ) .

MHD star formation theory holds that a self-gravitating cloud can be
supported by a purely static field with no associated waves (see e.g.
Stahler and Palla, 2004 ) . Flux freezing within molecular clouds
signifies both that the magnetic field is tied to the motion of the
fluid and that the gas itself is constrained by the field configuration;
magnetic field lines in cores have been indirectly observed to possess
bent or hour-glass shapes (Cortes and Crutcher, 2006 ) . Many giant
molecular cloud complexes possess a stratified appearance that could
well indicate alignment along the large-scale ambient field, as could
the prolate shapes of dense cores (Goodwin et al., 2002 ; McKee and
Ostriker, 2007 ) .

Rotation is a stabilising influence that raises the Jeans mass for a
fixed temperature and background radiation rate, and it flattens
numerical models of molecular clouds and cores if the rotational kinetic
energy is an appreciable fraction of the gravitational potential energy.
Molecular line observations such as those of Goodman et al. ( 1993 ) ,
Kane and Clemens ( 1997 ) and Pirogov et al. ( 2003 ) have shown that a
majority of dense molecular cloud cores present evidence of rotation.
Lada et al. ( 2003 ) in particular found evidence for differential
rotation in the B68 core, observing velocity gradients of 3.4 km s
@xmath pc @xmath from C @xmath O and 4.8 km s @xmath pc @xmath from N
@xmath H @xmath emission, which, as mentioned previously, trace the
outer and inner regions of the core respectively.

The typical angular momentum of cores is small and characterised by the
ratio of the rotational kinetic energy to the gravitational binding
energy, which is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

for a uniformly rotating sphere of constant density (Goodman et al.,
1993 ) . If @xmath is large the core is stable against gravitational
instability and collapse, however, if @xmath is very small the core will
never have enough rotational energy to support it against collapse and
it cannot develop any instabilities that are driven by rotation, such as
fragmentation. Goodman et al. ( 1993 ) found that the cores they studied
all had @xmath , with a typical value of @xmath on scales of @xmath pc,
confirming that rotation was not rapid enough to support the cores on
its own. This low value of @xmath could inhibit binary formation
mechanisms such as that caused by the rotation-induced fragmentation of
molecular cloud cores, however as all rotating cores are expected to
form centrifugal discs and discs may fragment to form a binary system
this value is not regarded as problematic.

The role of turbulence in supporting molecular cloud cores against
collapse is an increasing source of contention within the star formation
community, as the supersonic motions observed in cores by Goodman et al.
( 1998 ) , Crutcher ( 1999 ) and others could be formed by
magnetohydrodynamical turbulence that is in rough equipartition with
self-gravity in the core. MHD turbulence may be more important than
ambipolar diffusion in triggering the formation and collapse of
molecular cloud cores, as turbulent support decays quickly and speeds
star formation, while stronger turbulence could cause cores to fragment
and form multiple star systems. This scenario would suggest that
star-forming clouds are transient and that star formation is a rapid
process, in direct contrast with the quasistatic slow process that is
star formation driven by ambipolar diffusion (Mac Low and Klessen, 2004
; Elmegreen, 2007 ; Ward-Thompson et al., 2007 ; Ballesteros-Paredes
et al., 2007 , and the references within these reviews; see also Section
1.3 ) . Recent observations by Crutcher et al. ( 2009 ) were unable to
prove which of these mechanisms of core support and collapse is truly
dominant in molecular clouds; studies of the magnetic field strength and
orientations in cores with better resolution and higher signal-to-noise
ratios are required to determine between them (Mouschovias and Tassis,
2009 ) .

Depending on the local environment of a molecular cloud, different model
scenarios for the support and structure of clumps and cores may be
relevant in different regions of the cloud. The effect of local density,
pressure, temperature and magnetic field variations, as well as the
presence or absence of other nearby stars and protostars, likely all
contribute to determining which forces dominate the formation and
evolution of dense molecular cloud cores (Ward-Thompson et al., 2007 ) .

### 1.2 Magnetic Diffusion

Simulations of star formation have typically approximated the magnetic
field behaviour by ideal magnetohydrodynamics (IMHD), where the
mass-to-flux ratio is held constant and the magnetic field is regarded
as being frozen into the neutral medium (e.g. Galli et al., 2006 ;
Mellon and Li, 2008 ; Machida et al., 2008b ) . In this situation the
magnetic field and the particles move together in the collapsing flow,
however, this simplification only truly applies in the outermost regions
of gravitational collapse where the density is low. If IMHD were to hold
true throughout the collapse then the magnetic flux in the star would be
@xmath – @xmath times larger than that observed in young stars (this is
the “magnetic flux problem”, described in more detail in Chandrasekhar
and Fermi, 1953 , and Section 1.5 ) . A mechanism for allowing the field
to move against the inward flow of the neutral particles is required to
reduce the field in the protostar to observed values; at densities
higher than those encountered at the edge of molecular cloud cores flux
freezing breaks down, so that the magnetic field diffusion depends upon
the coupling of the field to the charged particles and the drift of
these against the neutral gas.

The diffusion of a magnetic field through a molecular cloud core is
determined by the drift of charged particles through the dominant
neutral component in response to the electric field in the neutral rest
frame. When the gas is weakly ionised, the charged particle species
develop a drift velocity with respect to the neutral fluid velocity. The
Lorentz force (which only acts on the charged particles) is transmitted
to the neutral gas through the drag forces caused by collisions between
the neutral and charged particles (e.g. Königl and Salmeron, 2011 ) .
These collisions determine the efficiency of the angular momentum
transport by the field in weakly ionised gas, and the outwards diffusion
of the magnetic field in a molecular cloud core, which erodes the
magnetic support until the core becomes gravitationally unstable and
undergoes collapse (Mestel and Spitzer, 1956 ) .

The degree of coupling between charged species and the neutral gas is
measured by the Hall parameter, @xmath , the ratio of the gyrofrequency
to the frequency of collisions between charged species @xmath and the
neutrals (where @xmath are typically ions or electrons, denoted by
@xmath and @xmath respectively). The Hall parameter measures the
relative importance of the Lorentz and drag forces in balancing the
electric force, and is defined by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

for a particle of mass @xmath , charge @xmath and collision frequency
@xmath , where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

@xmath is the rate coefficient for collisional momentum transfer between
the charged particles and neutrals of mass @xmath .

The relative drifts of different charged species with respect to the
neutral particles delineate three different magnetic diffusivity regimes
(aside from IMHD):

-   the Ohmic (resistive) diffusion limit, which dominates in high
    density regions where the ionisation fraction is low. The ions and
    the electrons frequently collide with the neutrals over the electron
    gyration period, and the magnetic field is decoupled from all
    charged particles. In this limit @xmath and the ion and electron
    drifts are not affected by the presence of the magnetic field. Ohmic
    diffusion is thought to be important in the innermost regions of the
    protostellar disc where the density and collisional rates are high
    (e.g. Shu et al., 2006 ; Machida et al., 2008a ) .

-   the ambipolar diffusion limit, which dominates in regions of
    relatively low density where the fractional ionisation is high. In
    this limit @xmath and the magnetic field is tied to the charged
    particles by electromagnetic stresses. The ionised component drifts
    with the field through the neutrals, redistributing the matter in
    the flux tubes. Ambipolar diffusion is dominant in molecular clouds
    (Wardle, 2007 ) , in protostellar discs at radial distances beyond
    @xmath AU and close to the surface of these discs nearer to the
    protostar (Salmeron, 2009 ) . It is the type of diffusion most
    commonly included in simulations of star formation that go beyond
    ideal MHD (e.g. Ciolek and Königl, 1998 ; Krasnopolsky and Königl,
    2002 ; Adams and Shu, 2007 ; Mellon and Li, 2009 , see also Section
    1.3 ) . In both the Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion limits, when the
    magnetic field is globally reversed the magnetic response of the
    disc is unchanged, as demonstrated in Figure 1.1 .

-   the Hall diffusion limit, which dominates in the intermediate
    regimes between ambipolar and Ohmic diffusion. In this limit @xmath
    and the charged species have a varied degree of coupling to the
    magnetic field, typically with the electrons tied to the magnetic
    field. The more massive particles such as ions and charged dust
    grains are decoupled from the magnetic field and are instead
    collisionally-coupled to the neutral gas. In the Hall regime, the
    magnetic response of the disc is no longer invariant under a global
    reversal of the magnetic field, as shown in Figure 1.2 , and
    plane-polarised damped Alfvén waves do not exist (Wardle and Ng,
    1999 ) . Hall diffusion is expected to dominate in many regions of
    molecular clouds as they undergo gravitational collapse (Wardle,
    2004a ) , and in protostellar discs (Sano and Stone, 2002a , b ) .

The degree of coupling between the magnetic field and the charged
particles depends upon the fractional ionisation of the gas and the
momentum transfer cross sections for collisions between the charged
particles and the neutrals. In a weakly ionised gas, such as that
encountered in molecular clouds, the abundances of charged species are
so low that their inertia and thermal pressure are negligible. Typically
in molecular clouds, molecular ionisation by cosmic rays is balanced by
the rapid dissociative recombination of molecular ions with the metal
ions that are the dominant positive charge carriers (Umebayashi and
Nakano, 1990 ; Wardle and Ng, 1999 ) .

For grains of radius @xmath @xmath m at a temperature of @xmath K in a
cloud with cosmic ray ionisation rate @xmath s @xmath , the ion density
is usually taken to scale as @xmath when @xmath cm @xmath (Elmegreen,
1979 ; Kamaya and Nishi, 2000 ) . This behaviour is an
oversimplification, as Ciolek and Mouschovias ( 1998 ) showed that for
typical cloud and grain parameters the proportionality of the ion
density cannot be parameterised by a single power law exponent @xmath ,
as @xmath for densities @xmath cm @xmath and @xmath for densities @xmath
cm @xmath , but it is still a reasonable and widely-adopted
approximation to the ion density in collapsing cores on scales @xmath AU
(see e.g. Shu et al., 1987 ; Galli and Shu, 1993a ; Ciolek and Königl,
1998 ; Contopoulos et al., 1998 ; Krasnopolsky and Königl, 2002 ) . This
shall be discussed further in Chapter 2 .

Outside of the central @xmath AU of a protostellar system the ionisation
of the gas is driven by stellar X-ray and UV radiation, as well as
interstellar cosmic rays (Hayashi, 1981 ; Glassgold et al., 2005 ) . At
the higher densities found here and more generally in the inner regions
of the collapsing core, grains are typically the dominant carriers of
both positive and negative charge and their densities scale as @xmath
(Nishi et al., 1991 ; Tielens, 2005 ) . In these innermost regions of
protostellar systems, the fractional ionisation is low, as the high
density leads to a very rapid recombination rate and the disc column
density shields the gas from cosmic rays and X-rays.

The degree of the coupling between the material and the magnetic field
depends also upon the abundance and size distribution of grains in the
gas. As dust grains have large cross sections they typically become
decoupled from the field at lower densities than other ions, reducing
the diffusivity of the gas. If grains are important and decoupled from
the field then Ohmic diffusion dominates, however if the grains have
settled or aggregated then Hall diffusion is important. In molecular
clouds that are not overdense, the ions and electrons are tied to the
field while large grains are not, so that ambipolar diffusion dominates
the magnetic field behaviour (Wardle, 2007 ) .

The regions of parameter space in which each of the three types of
coupling are dominant in a weakly ionised three-component plasma are
shown on a simplified @xmath - @xmath plane in Figure 1.3 (from Wardle,
2007 ) . It is clear from the figure that Ohmic diffusion dominates at
high densities with weak fields, while the opposite is true for
ambipolar diffusion. The intermediate region of parameter space between
these two limits is dominated by Hall diffusion. In particular, the Hall
term is significant for molecular gas densities in the range @xmath –
@xmath cm @xmath (when @xmath scales as @xmath ), although the presence
and particular distribution of grains complicates the calculation of the
diffusivities (Wardle and Ng, 1999 ) .

The nature of the coupling (ambipolar, Hall, Ohmic) determines the
magnetic field direction as the field lines emerge from the surface of
the protostellar disc. This in turn controls the amount of material that
is able to slide along the field lines and be flung outwards from the
surface instead of being accreted in disc-driven wind models (Wardle and
Königl, 1993 ; Wardle, 2004b ) .

It was noted by Norman and Heyvaerts ( 1985 ) that the Hall component of
the conductivity tensor could be important in cloud regions where the
neutral density and the temperature are weakly variable. They dismissed
the effects of the Hall term in their discussion of the resistivity of
molecular clouds, arguing that the Hall current leads to a charge
separation that generates an electrostatic field which modifies the
direction of the total field until the Hall current vanishes.

However, this logic does not hold in situations where the boundaries are
not idealised, and Wardle and Ng ( 1999 ) countered this argument using
the specific example of the quasistatic collapse of an axisymmetric
cloud core through a poloidal magnetic field. In their example the
current is toroidal and the electric field in the neutral fluid frame is
poloidal so that if the Hall and ambipolar diffusion components of the
conductivity are of the same order then the toroidal components of the
velocity and magnetic field will both contribute to the gravitational
support of the core. For this simple model, the boundaries on which
Norman and Heyvaerts ( 1985 ) presumed that the charge would build up
would be surfaces of constant azimuth, which cannot exist under
axisymmetry.

More generally, it is not possible in MHD to build up charged surfaces
such as those proposed by Norman and Heyvaerts ( 1985 ) , as typically
@xmath . As the gas velocities in molecular clouds are very low compared
to the speed of light (typically around @xmath – @xmath km s @xmath ;
see Section 1.1 and Crutcher, 1999 ; Lee et al., 2001 ) then @xmath and
the effects of charge separation are negligible compared to the magnetic
field effects. As the current @xmath in MHD then @xmath , and the Hall
current cannot cause a build up of charge that would generate an
electrostatic field. The argument that electrostatic fields would negate
the Hall current cannot then be used to dismiss the Hall effect in
collapse calculations, and it will be shown to be important to the
infall dynamics.

The magnitude and type of coupling that occurs between the fluid and
magnetic fields in molecular clouds and protostellar discs is uncertain
due to the difficulty in obtaining detailed observations in these
regions, particularly of the magnetic field. Calculations of the
ionisation equilibrium and resistivity by Wardle ( 2004a ) suggested
that the Hall diffusion term is important and may dominate the magnetic
field diffusion at many of the densities and field strengths encountered
in molecular clouds and protostellar discs, and presumably also during
the collapse stages between these two evolutionary phases. Further
calculations of the resistivity in protoplanetary discs by Wardle ( 2007
) showed that Hall diffusion dominates in the innermost regions of
protoplanetary discs. The Hall effect also imparts an implicit
handedness to the fluid dynamics (as illustrated in Figure 1.2 ) that is
sensitive to a global reversal of the magnetic field direction and could
be important in calculations of gravitational collapse and protostellar
disc formation (Wardle, 2007 ) .

As will be discussed in the following sections, in those simulations of
star formation that take a more sophisticated approach to the magnetic
field diffusion than adopting the IMHD approximation, the breakdown of
flux freezing in molecular clouds and protostellar discs is usually
approximated by either ambipolar diffusion in simulations of the early
stages of collapse where the density is low or Ohmic diffusion in the
higher density late stages of protostellar disc evolution. In most
numerical or semianalytic simulations of star formation the Hall
diffusion term is dismissed as insignificant, using the same arguments
as Norman and Heyvaerts ( 1985 ) ; however, the consequences of
including Hall diffusion in calculations of star formation by
quasistatic gravitational collapse and of the subsequent evolution of
protostellar discs are likely to be profound, in a similar manner to
that found for the magnetorotational instability (the MRI; Wardle, 1999
; Sano and Stone, 2002a , b ) .

The coupling between the field and the charged particles determines the
dynamics of the collapse and can help resolve the angular momentum and
magnetic flux problems of star formation, in which young stars have
rotation rates and field strengths much smaller than their equivalent
mass in a molecular cloud (Chandrasekhar and Fermi, 1953 ; Mestel and
Spitzer, 1956 ; Spitzer, 1978 ) . These problems are discussed in more
detail in Sections 1.4 and 1.5 ; while the relevance of Hall diffusion
in simulations of gravitational collapse, and its ability to enhance or
mitigate the magnetic braking catastrophe (which prevents disc
formation), are explored further in Section 1.6 .

### 1.3 Gravitational Collapse

Low-mass star formation by the gravitational collapse of molecular
clouds takes place in stages over many orders of magnitude in size and
density as illustrated in Figure 1.4 (adapted from figure 7 of Shu et
al., 1987 and figure 2 of Greene, 2001 ) . Firstly, cores form within
the cloud as a result of turbulent fluctuations, and they gradually
contract as ambipolar diffusion erodes the magnetic support (Figure 1.4
a, b; Tasker and Tan, 2009 ; Federrath et al., 2010 ) . Turbulence may
also support the core against collapse, and its decay can aid the
magnetic diffusion in triggering star formation (Mac Low and Klessen,
2004 ; Ballesteros-Paredes et al., 2007 ) .

The core becomes gravitationally unstable and collapses dynamically into
what is termed a “pseudodisc” (Galli and Shu, 1993a , b ) , which has a
flattened shape due to the material falling in preferentially along the
magnetic field lines that support it against collapse in the radial
direction. A protostar arises at the centre of the pseudodisc, which may
be surrounded by a centrifugally-supported protostellar disc (Terebey
et al., 1984 ; Shu et al., 1987 ) . Material collapsing from the
envelope onto the protostar must pass through the pseudodisc and
protostellar disc, building up material and flux at the boundaries of
these that take the form of shock fronts as the dynamically-infalling
gas collides with the slower-moving disc material. A disc wind or jet
may form, launched from the inner regions of the collapse (Figure 1.4 c;
Wardle and Königl, 1993 ; Tomisaka, 2002 ; Allen et al., 2003a ) .

When the density becomes larger than @xmath cm @xmath the gas becomes
optically thick and the thermal structure of the collapsing core is
nearly adiabatic, forming a thermally supported inner core (the “first”
or ”opaque” core; e.g. Larson, 1969 ; Machida et al., 2007 ) which
collapses dynamically into the protostar (the “second core”; Larson,
1969 ; Machida et al., 2006 ) . Eventually the remainders of the
collapsing envelope and pseudodisc are accreted or dissipated by the
wind, and the protostar becomes visible at optical wavelengths as a T
Tauri star with associated protoplanetary disc and outflow (Figure 1.4
d; Norman and Silk, 1980 ; Kitamura et al., 2002 ; Andrews and Williams,
2007 ; Dullemond and Monnier, 2010 ) . The system continues to contract,
and planets may accrete from or fragment the disc around the pre-main
sequence star. Gaps begin to appear in the protoplanetary disc as the
planets sweep up the gas, and the system is visible as a protostar with
debris disc (Figure 1.4 e; Blum and Wurm, 2008 ; Wyatt, 2008 ) .
Finally, the star joins the main sequence and the stellar wind
dissipates the remainder of the protoplanetary disc, leaving behind a
young stellar system (Figure 1.4 f; Terebey et al., 1984 ;
Ward-Thompson, 2002 ) .

It is impossible to cover all of the work that has been done both
observationally and in theoretical simulations of star formation in the
space available here. Instead, this section shall focus primarily on the
isothermal collapse of a molecular cloud core to an adiabatic protostar,
potentially surrounded by a centrifugally-supported disc (Figure 1.4
b–c) for low-mass molecular cloud cores. For further information on the
other stages of star formation, the evolution and dynamics of
protostellar discs, or the processes involved in the formation of
higher-mass stars such as fragmentation and turbulence, the reader is
directed to the review of Stahler and Palla ( 2004 ) for a basic
overview and the more detailed reviews by Larson ( 2003 ) , McKee and
Ostriker ( 2007 ) and Machida ( 2011 ) for a more complete description.

#### 1.3.1 Core formation and support

Molecular clouds are transient objects, with irregular structures and
internal motions that suggest they are dynamic and rapidly changing (di
Francesco et al., 2007 ) . They are likely formed by compressive motions
of gravitational or turbulent origin (or some combination of the two).
Giant molecular clouds are believed to be formed by gravitational
instability (Tasker and Tan, 2009 ) , or the agglomeration of smaller
clouds (Dobbs, 2008 ) ; and they are concentrated towards the spiral
arms of galaxies (Stark and Lee, 2006 ) . Smaller molecular clouds can
be formed by ram pressure from supersonic flows such as those driven by
supernova blast waves and the MRI in galaxies (Norman and Silk, 1980 ;
Ballesteros-Paredes et al., 2007 , and the references therein) .

Molecular cloud cores are the gravitationally-bound regions of higher
density within molecular clouds that are the progenitors of protostars.
There are currently two competing models for the formation of molecular
cloud cores which are most likely extremes on the continuum of collapse
models. The first is a slow, quasistatic core formation in which a dense
region of the molecular cloud becomes centrally-condensed by an
ambipolar diffusion-driven phase of collapse (e.g. Shu et al., 1987 ;
Basu and Ciolek, 2004 ) or by the gradual dissipation of low-level
turbulent fields (e.g. Myers, 1999 ) . At the other extreme is a more
dynamic formation process in which highly turbulent flows create large
scale fluctuations and inhomogeneities in the gas of the molecular
cloud, some of which become gravitationally unstable and collapse to
form stars, with MHD waves carrying away any excess turbulent energy.
This behaviour has yet to be seen in simulations of nonmagnetic
molecular clouds, however the models of Tasker and Tan ( 2009 ) and
Federrath et al. ( 2010 ) both demonstrated gravitational instabilities
in nonmagnetic clouds, and gravitational instabilities have been
observed in simulations of large isolated cores and small clouds with a
few magnetic cores (e.g. Basu and Ciolek, 2004 ; Price and Bate, 2007 )
.

Observations of isolated cores show that mild turbulence and magnetic
fields play an approximately equal role in the evolution of molecular
cloud cores (Crutcher, 1999 ) , while observations of protoclusters and
molecular cloud clumps show supersonic infall velocities that require
strong external compression and are inconsistent with self-initiated
forms of collapse (di Francesco et al., 2001 ; Ward-Thompson et al.,
2007 , and the references therein) . These suggest that each of the core
formation models may be valid under differing circumstances, with the
turbulence-driven model applying to cluster-forming clumps and the
ambipolar diffusion model to isolated low-mass star forming cores.

Assuming that the ionisation rate in a core scales with density as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the numerical coefficient of the ionisation with typical
value @xmath cm @xmath g @xmath (Elmegreen, 1979 ) , the ratio of the
ambipolar diffusion time scale to the time scale for dynamical collapse
is approximately given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

For a typical value of the ion-neutral drag coefficient @xmath cm @xmath
g @xmath s @xmath (Draine et al., 1983 ) , this ratio is evaluated as
@xmath , demonstrating that ambipolar diffusion takes place at a
relatively slow rate until the density is sufficiently high that the
ionisation fraction begins to depart from the relationship described in
Equation 1.7 (Ciolek and Mouschovias, 1998 ) . As ambipolar diffusion is
a slow process, once the magnetic support of the core has been eroded,
the core will undergo rapid dynamic collapse and form a protostar before
the more gradual contraction under ambipolar diffusion could cause a
protostar to appear at the origin.

Star formation is an inefficient process (Evans, 1999 ) and the ratio of
the ambipolar diffusion to dynamical time scales in Equation 1.8
provides an explanation for this, as a slow rate of contraction caused
by ambipolar diffusion could see many cores dissipating before they have
the chance to form stars (Shu et al., 1987 ) . On the other hand,
numerical simulations by Clark and Bonnell ( 2004 ) showed that clouds
with large turbulent motions also result in low star formation
efficiencies as the bulk of the cloud escapes due to the initial
supersonic motion. Both of the dominant theoretical mechanisms for star
formation (ambipolar diffusion and turbulence) could then be responsible
for the observed low rate of star formation.

Molecular cloud cores are supported against gravitational collapse by
the magnetic field as long as the core is thermally and magnetically
“subcritical”, that is, the mass-to-flux ratio is less than the critical
value,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the magnetic flux threading the cloud and @xmath is a
dimensionless (in cgs units) numerical coefficient that depends upon the
internal distribution of the magnetic field and density (McKee et al.,
1993 ) . Discs with only thermal support along the field lines have
@xmath (Mouschovias and Spitzer, 1976 ) ; an infinite cold sheet has
@xmath (Nakano and Nakamura, 1978 ) , and simulations of cold clouds
with different distributions of a poloidal field require @xmath – @xmath
for the central flux tube to be critical (Tomisaka et al., 1988b ) .

Taking a value of @xmath , Crutcher ( 1999 ) found that the mass-to-flux
ratio in their observed molecular cloud cores was typically twice the
critical value, suggesting that static magnetic fields are insufficient
to support molecular cloud cores against gravity on their own. They also
found that cores were in near-virial balance, which was used as evidence
to suggest that the cores were supported by turbulence and that it is
the decay of such turbulence that triggers collapse (Myers, 1999 ) .
Simulations have shown that for cores that are close to the critical
value the dynamical and ambipolar diffusion time scales are comparable
(Li and Nakamura, 2004 ; Klessen et al., 2011 ) . It is likely to be the
case that both the decay of turbulence and the loss of magnetic support
in cores are important in initiating dynamic collapse, although only
magnetic support is considered in this work.

Magnetic braking, by which the torque exerted on the rotating gas by the
twisting of magnetic field lines transports angular momentum from the
collapsing core to the molecular cloud, is very effective during this
phase of molecular cloud core contraction. This process reduces the
angular momentum of cores to the low values observed (Contopoulos
et al., 1998 ) , helping to resolve the traditional angular momentum
problem of star formation in which young stars have less angular
momentum than the initial core from which they formed during this early,
isothermal phase of collapse (see Sections 1.4 and 1.5 and the

#### 1.3.2 Dynamic collapse

Once ambipolar diffusion has caused enough of the neutral material to
move inwards with respect to the magnetic field, the mass-to-flux ratio
exceeds the critical value defined in Equation 1.9 . The core is then
said to be “supercritical” and the central density of the molecular
cloud core formally tries to achieve infinite values. It contracts
dynamically to form a protostar surrounded by a slowly-rotating
pseudodisc, while the envelope remains magnetically subcritical. The
ambipolar diffusion time scale remains relevant to the evolution of the
core envelope so long as it is subcritical.

During this contraction, the field is effectively frozen into the cloud
as IMHD holds true, and the infalling material is deflected by the field
lines towards the equatorial plane, creating a pseudodisc that is not
rotationally-supported. The pseudodisc contracts dynamically in the
radial direction, dragging the field lines into a split monopole
configuration (Galli and Shu, 1993a , b ) . The resulting build up in
magnetic pressure acts as an impediment to further collapse, however,
the magnetic tension in the envelope never suffices to suspend the
envelope against the gravity of the growing protostar (Allen et al.,
2003b , a ) .

Disregarding the effects of rotation and the magnetic field on the core
for the moment, a slowly contracting molecular cloud core that is not
artificially separated from its surroundings will tend to acquire the
density distribution of a singular isothermal sphere,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the isothermal sound speed (Larson, 1969 ; Shu et al.,
1987 ) . There are two limiting cases to the gravitational collapse of a
singular isothermal sphere. The first is that presented in the solutions
of Larson ( 1969 ) and Penston ( 1969 ) , in which the collapse begins
near the outer radius of a marginally unstable core and the @xmath
density gradient is created as the wave of collapse propagates inward,
leaving every scale marginally unstable as the collapse accelerates. At
the time when the protostar first forms the collapse is highly dynamic
with an infall speed of @xmath , and the accretion rate onto the star is
high.

The second case is that of Shu ( 1977 ) , in which the evolution of the
core is much slower and the infall velocity at the moment of protostar
formation is negligible. The collapse is initiated in the centre of the
core, and the “expansion wave”, the point at which gas begins to fall
inward, propagates outward at the sound speed. This process is referred
to as “inside-out collapse” and inside of this rarefaction wave the gas
accelerates until it is nearly free falling onto the protostar.

These solutions are referred to as examples of “self-similar” or
scale-invariant collapse, as the properties of the collapsing core are
similar (in the mathematical sense) to those properties at an earlier
period of time at smaller radii (self-similarity is a typical property
of fractals). The self-similar collapse models represent a semianalytic
method of exploring collapse at higher resolution than is possible in
numerical calculations, which are limited by either the number of
particles or the scaling of the box in which the collapse takes place.
Although they require many assumptions and simplifications to the gas
dynamics (see Chapter 2 for more information on the formulation of a
self-similar model), the calculation of similarity solutions is a useful
analytic technique for studying star formation. Self-similar behaviour
is often observed in numerical simulations of collapse (e.g. Masunaga
and Inutsuka, 2000 ; Tomisaka, 2002 ; Mellon and Li, 2009 ; Dapp and
Basu, 2010 , and others) ; yet similarity solutions can follow the
collapse to regions of high density close to the protostar, including
inside the boundary of the sink cells that are often used to represent
the inner point mass in numerical calculations.

The evolution of star-forming molecular clouds has been studied through
numerical simulations, primarily of the ambipolar diffusion-initiated
formation of supercritical cores and the early stages of dynamical
collapse (e.g. Machida et al., 2008a ; Kunz and Mouschovias, 2009 , 2010
) . These numerical simulations of collapse tend towards the similarity
solutions during the dynamical collapse stage despite being started with
different initial conditions in the core (e.g. Tomisaka, 2002 ; Mellon
and Li, 2008 , 2009 ; Federrath et al., 2010 ) , even though collapsing
flows may never actually approach the similarity solutions in reality.

The Larson–Penston and Shu similarity solutions represent extreme cases
of the continuum of nonmagnetic, nonrotating solutions (“fast” and
“slow” collapse), and their applicability is determined by the initial
conditions chosen to describe the core. The more general family of
nonmagnetic, nonrotating self-similar gravitational collapse solutions
were explored by Whitworth and Summers ( 1985 ) ; the outer density
profile in this type of solution is @xmath whereas in the innermost
regions near the central singularity the density is @xmath .

The similarity solutions have been duplicated by numerical simulations:
for example, Federrath et al. ( 2010 ) were able to reproduce the
density gradients and mass accretion rates of the isothermal sphere
modelled by Shu ( 1977 ) in their calculations of cluster formation.
This was achieved using sink particles in their hydrodynamic simulations
to represent the central point masses which are notoriously difficult to
model otherwise due to their high concentration of mass in a small
region of the calculation grid. The simulations of Tomisaka ( 2002 ) and
Mellon and Li ( 2008 , 2009 ) also demonstrated self-similarity in their
collapsing flows for single cores; this behaviour is regarded as an
important test of the models.

These early similarity solutions did not include the effects of rotation
and magnetic fields on the core, nor did they include turbulence, which
becomes more important as the core mass increases. It is the addition of
a magnetic field that leads to the formation of a pseudodisc (Galli and
Shu, 1993a , b ) , while rotation may lead to the formation and growth
of a rotationally-supported disc at the centre of the pseudodisc
(Terebey et al., 1984 ) .

In rotating collapse simulations the conservation of angular momentum
during the near-free fall dynamical collapse results in a progressive
increase in the centrifugal force that eventually becomes important and
creates a centrifugal barrier to collapse, forming a
rotationally-supported disc around the central protostar. If the
centrifugal force becomes strong enough it may trigger the fragmentation
of the contracting core and cause the formation of a binary or multiple
star system (e.g. the solutions of Ward-Thompson, 2002 ; Clark and
Bonnell, 2006 ; Kudoh et al., 2007 ; Price and Bate, 2007 ; Machida
et al., 2008b ; Klessen et al., 2011 ; André et al., 2009 ) .

Early similarity solutions that included rotation showed that it causes
a centrally-condensed disc to form around the protostar, disrupting the
near-spherical dynamic collapse. For the singular isothermal sphere,
most of the collapsing envelope settles into a centrifugally-supported
disc around the protostar (Terebey et al., 1984 ; Shu et al., 1987 ) .
Numerical simulations by Matsumoto et al. ( 1997 ) showed that the
behaviour of collapsing cores with rotation approached that of analytic
self-similar models of a singular isothermal disc (e.g. Hayashi et al.,
1982 ; Toomre, 1982 ) , or a rotationally-flattened (due to the
conservation of angular momentum) fast isothermal collapse (Saigo and
Hanawa, 1998 ) . This same self-similar behaviour is seen in numerical
simulations with rotation and magnetic fields (e.g. Machida et al.,
2008a ; Mellon and Li, 2009 , and the references in Section 1.5 ) .

When a magnetic field (aligned with the axis of rotation) is present
during the dynamic collapse phase, the protostar develops in a nearly
self-similar way. The collapse propagates as a fast MHD wave, travelling
faster in the direction perpendicular to the field, creating a prolate
shape immediately inside the head of the expansion wave. Further inside
the collapsing core, the tangential component of the Lorentz force
produced by the curvature of the magnetic field lines deflects the gas
towards the equatorial plane, forming an oblate pseudodisc of flattened
infalling material (Galli and Shu, 1993a , b ) . The magnetic field of
the core takes on a characteristic hourglass shape in which the field
lines flare above and below the pseudodisc (also called a split
monopole) that is consistent with observations (Cortes and Crutcher,
2006 ; Girart et al., 2006 ; Gonçalves et al., 2008 ; Attard et al.,
2009 ) .

Calculations of magnetic collapse that continued through to the stage of
accretion by a central point mass, such as those by Ciolek and
Mouschovias ( 1993 , 1994 , 1995 ) , Ciolek and Königl ( 1998 ) , and
Mellon and Li ( 2009 ) , showed that ambipolar diffusion, which is
unimportant during the dynamic collapse phase, is revitalised once a
protostar starts to grow in the centre of the core. This leads to a
decoupling of the magnetic flux from the inflowing gas, which takes
place within an outwardly-propagating magnetohydrodynamic shock, the
existence of which was first proposed by Li and McKee ( 1996 ) . This
MHD shock (referred to as the magnetic diffusion shock in the results
presented in this work) takes the form of a continuous transition in the
calculations of Desch and Mouschovias ( 2001 ) and Krasnopolsky and
Königl ( 2002 ) because the shock structure depends upon ambipolar
diffusion, which is explicitly determined in their equations. Inwards of
the shock the magnetic braking reduces the angular momentum, and
ambipolar diffusion reduces the magnetic flux as the neutral material
continues to fall inward at a near-free fall speed. The centrifugal
force starts to become important, gradually triggering the formation of
a hydrodynamic shock that strongly decelerates the infalling matter and
allows a Keplerian disc to form.

Accretion through the pseudodisc to the free fall region and inner disc
may occur in bursts, as mass piled up at the magnetic barriers opposes
rapid accretion. As the split monopole field inside of the pseudodisc
grows, mass builds at the boundary of the disc until it becomes too
heavy to be supported. The excess mass rushes inside towards the origin,
dragging in more flux to be assimilated by the split monopole; the
magnetic barrier grows and mass must then build up over a longer time
interval before overcoming the barrier and becoming part of the
protostar. These oscillations first appeared in the numerical
simulations of Allen et al. ( 2003a , b ) as a result of instabilities
that were caused by the simplified physics in their simulations, however
they were later reproduced in the “magnetic wall” that inhibits collapse
in the calculations of Tassis and Mouschovias ( 2005a , b ) , and in the
magnetogyrosphere of Mellon and Li ( 2008 , 2009 ) . Allen et al. (
2003b ) suggested that this magnetic behaviour may be responsible for
observed FU Orionis outbursts that are not well-explained at present.

#### 1.3.3 Late stages of collapse

Once the central density reaches @xmath cm @xmath the assumption of
isothermality breaks down as the gas becomes optically thick against the
thermal radiation from dust grains. The gas becomes adiabatic, and once
it is hot enough to dissociate molecular hydrogen, the protostar
undergoes a second dynamic collapse (Tomisaka, 2002 ; Machida et al.,
2007 , 2008a ) . At @xmath cm @xmath the magnetic field is effectively
decoupled from the gas and Ohmic diffusion becomes dominant (Nakano
et al., 2002 ) . This expected behaviour was not seen in the numerical
simulations of Desch and Mouschovias ( 2001 ) where the gas decoupled
from the field before the breakdown of isothermality. During the
decoupling stage in their simulations the electrons were very well
attached to the magnetic field instead of the expected ions; the ions
had detached from the field at lower densities. Desch and Mouschovias (
2001 ) found that Ohmic dissipation was unimportant during the
decoupling stage because of the high electron mobility and the small
@xmath H @xmath cross section, although it does become important in the
innermost regions of the adiabatic core and protostellar disc where the
density is particularly high (e.g. Dapp and Basu, 2010 ; Machida, 2011 )
.

Accretion onto the adiabatic core and protostar may be stopped by
hydrodynamic, magnetohydrodynamic and photoevaporative processes.
Because of the ubiquity of bipolar outflows in star forming regions,
Terebey et al. ( 1984 ) implicated young stellar object (YSO) winds and
jets as the dominant practical mechanisms by which forming stars define
their own masses, particularly in isolated regions of low-mass star
formation. It is believed that YSO outflows arise because of a
fundamental interaction between the rapid rotation in a Keplerian disc
and a strongly magnetised object such as a protostar (e.g. Ghosh and
Lamb, 1979a ; Blandford and Payne, 1982 ; Wardle and Königl, 1993 ) .

The collapsing pseudodisc, protostellar disc and adiabatic core can lose
angular momentum and collapse further when the magnetic field threading
the collapsing material is able to generate an outflow. Many numerical
simulations have now demonstrated that both fast and slow jets and winds
can be generated from the thin disc both before and after the formation
of the adiabatic core (for example, the simulations of Tomisaka, 2002 ;
Allen et al., 2003a ; Machida et al., 2007 , 2008a , 2008b ; Mellon and
Li, 2008 , 2009 ; Bate, 2010 ; Ciardi and Hennebelle, 2010 ) . The
weakly ionised gas in the rotating collapsing flow induces a toroidal
field that is able to accelerate the gas and form an outflow, the
intensity of which depends upon the rotation rate and field strength.
Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) were able to demonstrate how a disc
wind could be included into their semianalytic solutions by including a
mass loss term in their asymptotic inner disc solutions (which satisfy
the conditions necessary for wind launching), however at present this
work has yet to be performed (see Wardle and Königl, 1993 , and Section
6.3 for further details) .

Studies of three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical calculations have
shown that the formation of the stellar core drives a shock wave through
the disc, and dramatically decreases the accretion rate onto the stellar
core (Bate, 2010 ) — this behaviour was also present in earlier
one-dimensional simulations of radiative, hydrodynamical collapse of
molecular cloud cores (e.g. Masunaga and Inutsuka, 2000 ) . Radiation
produced in the first stars in a molecular cloud reduces the ability of
cores to fragment, which can suppress formation of low mass objects by
increasing the temperature in the high density material (Krumholz and
McKee, 2008 ; Price and Bate, 2009 ; Krumholz, 2011 ; Kunz and
Mouschovias, 2009 , 2010 ) . Numerical simulations of molecular clouds
with strong (though supercritical) magnetic fields and radiative
feedback demonstrate an inefficient star formation process with a star
formation rate that approaches the observed rate in molecular clouds
(Price and Bate, 2009 ) .

### 1.4 Rotation and the Angular Momentum Problem

One of the classic problems of star formation is the requirement that
nearly all of the initial angular momentum of the molecular cloud core
must be removed or redistributed during the formation process. Stars
typically have far less angular momentum than the equivalent mass in the
interstellar medium; even molecular cloud cores rotate much more slowly
than would be expected if they had condensed from the diffuse
interstellar medium with no loss of angular momentum (e.g. Goodman
et al., 1993 ) . Table 1.2 lists characteristic values of the angular
momentum for many of the stages of star formation and evolution to
illustrate this point.

The basic angular momentum problem is well illustrated by the example
presented in Spitzer ( 1978 ) : as an extreme case, consider a
filamentary interstellar cloud in the form of a cylinder with length
@xmath pc and a radius @xmath pc, rotating around its long axis at the
galactic value of angular velocity @xmath s @xmath . This cloud will
have a mass of about @xmath M @xmath when the number density is @xmath
cm @xmath . The rotational effects will not impede collapse parallel to
the long axis, but in order to form a star of solar density the radius
must decrease by a factor of about 10 @xmath , while the conservation of
angular momentum requires that @xmath must increase by @xmath . The
resulting rotation period would then be roughly a minute, with the
rotational velocity of the star becoming 20% of the speed of light, and
the centrifugal force exceeds gravity at the equator by four orders of
magnitude.

While this is a simplified example, the argument demonstrates the
problem well. In Table 1.2 the discrepancy between the specific angular
momentum of a T Tauri star ( @xmath cm @xmath s @xmath ) and that of a
molecular cloud core on the scale of 0.1 pc ( @xmath cm @xmath s @xmath
) is shown to be around four orders of magnitude. The angular momentum
problem is also highlighted by observations that show many young stars
are rotating slowly in comparison to molecular clouds (e.g. Goodman
et al., 1993 ; di Francesco et al., 2001 ; Lada et al., 2003 ; di
Francesco et al., 2007 ) . It is possible that young stars could be
braked after formation by such mechanisms as stellar winds or
interactions between the magnetic field of the star and the
protoplanetary disc (e.g. Ghosh and Lamb, 1979a ; Königl, 1991 ; Matt
and Pudritz, 2008 ) , but some braking must occur earlier to allow the
protostar and disc to form.

Magnetic forces, gravitational forces and pressure forces may all play a
role in transporting angular momentum in star forming clouds. As
outlined in Section 1.1 , the magnetic forces can exceed thermal forces
in molecular clouds and cores, and magnetic braking can remove much of
the initial angular momentum from a large scale cloud and determine the
amount of angular momentum remaining in the dense core (Basu and
Mouschovias, 1994 , 1995a , 1995b ) . The basic process of magnetic
braking is that the torque exerted on the rotating fluid by the twisting
of magnetic field lines causes the vertical propagation of Alfvén waves.
These waves carry angular momentum from the cloud to material external
to the cloud, in a manner first described by Mestel and Spitzer ( 1956 )
and numerically calculated by Mouschovias and Paleologou ( 1979 , 1980 )
. This braking of the rotational motions by the magnetic field is
believed to be the dominant mechanism for reducing the angular momentum
in collapsing flows to the low values observed in YSOs (McKee et al.,
1993 ; McKee and Ostriker, 2007 ) , and shall be explained more fully in
Chapter 2 .

There are three major episodes of angular momentum transfer during the
formation and evolution of a young star. The first is the formation of
molecular cloud cores from the host cloud, where the usual solution to
the angular momentum problem is magnetic braking and the transfer of
angular momentum by Alfvén waves from the centre to the outer regions
(Mouschovias, 1991 ) . This tends to produce centrally-condensed
uniformly-rotating cloud cores that are stable against fragmentation
(Basu and Mouschovias, 1994 ) . This solution has been considered
somewhat problematic as it is difficult to form binaries from such
stable cores and young binary stars are very common, however, stable
cores form centrifugal discs that may fragment and form binary systems
(Bodenheimer, 1995 ) .

More recent research has shown that the formation of cores may also be
triggered by fragmentation that is regulated by magnetic fields and
ambipolar diffusion, and that the rate of core growth is dependant upon
the magnetic field strength in the core (Kudoh et al., 2007 ) . Boss (
2009 ) showed further that the shape of molecular cloud cores is
important to the angular momentum transport and fragmentation. Their
radiative hydrodynamical code, which included prescriptions for the
magnetic braking and ambipolar diffusion, showed that oblate cores
collapse to form rings that are susceptible to fragmentation; and that
the fragmentation of prolate cores depends upon the density profile in
the core — cores that possess shallow density profiles being more likely
to fragment than those with steep profiles.

As is expected, angular momentum is approximately conserved during the
dynamic near-free fall collapse of a core into a flattened pseudodisc
and so this phase of star formation does not add to the angular momentum
problem (Galli and Shu, 1993a , b ) . However inside the pseudodisc at
the centre of the dynamic collapse the magnetic field has built up to
the point where it is possible for magnetic braking to be the dominant
force reducing the angular momentum in the collapsing fluid.

Fragmentation into a wide binary is likely during the phase of
isothermal pseudodisc evolution if the initial angular momentum is high;
the spin angular momentum of the cloud is converted into the orbital
angular momentum of the binary (Mestel and Spitzer, 1956 ; Larson, 1985
; Bodenheimer, 1995 ) . The occurrence of fragmentation during collapse
depends on the initial ratio of thermal to gravitational energy (Tsuribe
and Inutsuka, 1999a , b ) and in a wide range of cases the final outcome
of gravitational collapse is the formation of a binary or multiple
system via the formation and fragmentation of a ring or bar structure in
the fluid instead of, or as well as, the expected disc configuration
(Matsumoto and Hanawa, 2003 ) .

If the initial angular momentum of the core is low then the flattened
pseudodisc will be unable to fragment and will instead form a central
protostellar core surrounded by an optically thick disc where the
angular momentum must be removed by magnetic fields, turbulent viscosity
or the formation of a massive planet that may interact with the disc to
allow material to accrete onto the star.

The ideal MHD simulations of Mellon and Li ( 2008 ) showed that their
strongly-braked disc was surrounded by a vertically-extended structure,
referred to as a magnetogyrosphere, where the angular momentum was
parked; this was supported by a combination of the (toroidal) magnetic
field and rotation. The collapsing fluid was channelled by the magnetic
wall surrounding the magnetogyrosphere into the equatorial region, and
the infalling material was braked as it crossed a series of centrifugal
barriers. It is possible that such a magnetogyrosphere has been observed
in the Class 0 source IRAM 04191 (see the references and interpretation
within Mellon and Li, 2008 ) ; however higher resolution observations
are needed to confirm this.

The magnetorotational instability (MRI) has been shown to generate
turbulence that can remove angular momentum from the infalling gas in
the pseudodisc and later Keplerian disc (Balbus and Hawley, 1998 ) . The
MRI acts by converting the free energy of differential rotation into
turbulent motions that transfer angular momentum radially outward via
the Maxwell stress of small scale, disordered magnetic fields. Its
properties have been studied in both the linear and nonlinear stages and
it has been shown to be very efficient at removing angular momentum from
discs (e.g. Sano and Stone, 2002a , b ; Salmeron and Wardle, 2003 , 2004
, 2005 ) . Salmeron et al. ( 2007a , b ) showed that radial angular
momentum transport by the MRI operates where @xmath , where @xmath is
the ratio of the Keplerian rotation time to the neutral-ion momentum
exchange time and @xmath is the midplane ratio of the Alfvén speed to
the sound speed. They also found that radial and vertical angular
momentum transport operate in different regions of the disc, with the
MRI dominant when @xmath .

The semianalytic self-similar collapse solutions of Krasnopolsky and
Königl ( 2002 ) produced rotationally-supported discs that were
magnetorotationally stable, however, their calculations were limited to
one dimension and contained only ambipolar diffusion in their
approximation to the magnetic field diffusion, so they may have
oversimplified the calculations to the point where the disc could not be
magnetorotationally unstable. The MRI has been shown to be important in
protostellar and protoplanetary discs (Sano and Stone, 2002a , b ) and
may be important at other points in the star formation process.

Another possible way to remove angular momentum from lower-mass
flattened pseudodiscs is to form a massive planet or companion star in
the disc. The torques exerted on the disc by a planet can transport
angular momentum from the inner regions to the outer parts of the disc,
and can also drive inflow towards the central protostar. This behaviour
has been observed in numerical simulations of gravitational collapse
such as those by Bate and Bonnell ( 2005 ) , Machida et al. ( 2008b )
and others.

The final evolutionary stage in which the angular momentum problem is
evident is the necessary removal of angular momentum from the fluid that
is accreting from the innermost rotationally-supported disc, as it
typically carries enough angular momentum that it will spin up the star
in a relatively short period of time (Bodenheimer, 1995 ) . In this
regime the problem is likely solved by the formation of a disc wind or
stellar winds, as the protostellar wind blows away the majority of the
remaining non-accreted envelope of the core independent of the magnetic
braking (Shu et al., 1987 ) . It has been shown that a rotating disc
wind can remove angular momentum as well as mass from the innermost
partially-ionised region of the disc very efficiently (Machida et al.,
2007 , 2008a ) ; the simulations of Tomisaka ( 2002 ) showed that 99% of
the total angular momentum of their protostellar systems was transferred
from the system by outflows during the adiabatic second phase of
collapse.

Stellar dynamo activity may also contribute to the formation of a
magnetospheric region around the protostar that can generate a bipolar
jet; this could remove further angular momentum in order to resolve the
angular momentum problem (Larson, 2003 ) . Alternatively, the
interaction of the stellar dipole magnetic field with the accretion disc
could also remove angular momentum from the protostar (or spin it up, if
the initial rotation rate is low). Such accretion would take place in a
steady state along the stellar magnetic field lines, where the spin-up
torque on the star is balanced by a spin-down torque transmitted by
field lines that thread the disc beyond the corotation radius (Ghosh and
Lamb, 1979a , b ; Königl, 1991 ) .

During the later stages of pre-main sequence contraction, when the
interaction between the star and disc is no longer important, the YSO
evolves with near-conservation of angular momentum, and the angular
velocity of the pre-main sequence protostar decouples from that of the
envelope (Bodenheimer, 1995 ) .

The angular momentum problem has in recent years been so well solved by
simulations that include the transport of angular momentum by magnetic
braking that it has given rise to the magnetic braking catastrophe in
which all of the angular momentum has been removed from the collapsing
material so that it free falls with no rotation onto the protostar. This
behaviour has been observed in many simulations with different coupling
between the field and the matter; generally it occurs in simulations
that adopt IMHD (e.g. Allen et al., 2003b , a ; Mellon and Li, 2008 ) or
non-ideal MHD in the form of ambipolar diffusion (e.g. Krasnopolsky and
Königl, 2002 ; Mellon and Li, 2009 ) . This catastrophe has also been
seen in simulations in which the magnetic field and the rotational axis
of the core are not initially aligned (Price and Bate, 2007 ; Hennebelle
and Ciardi, 2009 ; Ciardi and Hennebelle, 2010 ) .

### 1.5 Magnetic Fields and the Magnetic Flux Problem

In a similar puzzle to the angular momentum problem, there is a several
orders of magnitude discrepancy between the observed values and upper
limits on the magnetic flux of T Tauri stars and the flux associated
with the corresponding mass in the precollapse molecular cloud
(Chandrasekhar and Fermi, 1953 ; Mestel and Spitzer, 1956 ) . The
mass-to-flux ratio in stars is very large, with @xmath – @xmath in
magnetic stars and @xmath in the Sun, whereas the mass-to-flux ratio in
molecular clouds is typically @xmath (Nakano, 1983 ; Crutcher, 1999 ) .
The magnetic flux problem of protostellar collapse is a complex puzzle
that has not yet been completely solved.

The problem is illustrated using Spitzer’s example of a cylinder-shaped
cloud containing 1 M @xmath of constant density gas from Section 1.4
once more. Assuming conservation of flux, the magnetic field in the
collapsed protostar exceeds that in the original cloud by @xmath , the
same factor as @xmath , so that if @xmath were 3 @xmath G in the
original cloud, the formed star of solar type would possess a magnetic
field that is equal to @xmath G. The magnetic energy in the star exceeds
the gravitational energy by several times, but the difference between
the field in the model star and that in a real young stellar object (
@xmath – @xmath times) is not as large a discrepancy as that which
defines the angular momentum problem (Spitzer, 1978 , see also the
previous section) .

In order to reduce the magnetic flux in the collapsing cloud, there are
several processes that can be invoked: the first is local reconnection
of field lines. This process occurs when two lines of force intersect at
a point of zero magnetic field strength or where two oppositely-directed
lines of magnetic force are pushed together by gravitational or
hydromagnetic forces (Spitzer, 1978 ) . This alters the topology of the
field, and reconnection can displace the region in which the flux
crosses the forming or accreting disc. Galli and Shu ( 1993b ) observed
reconnection as a numerical artefact in their calculations, arguing that
the pinched configuration of the magnetic field in the equatorial plane
of their pseudodisc could be subject to several instabilities that would
cause reconnection. Numerical reconnection has been observed in the
collapse calculations of Galli et al. ( 2006 , 2009 ) and Krasnopolsky
et al. ( 2010 ) ; this is not true reconnection and can lead to
anomalous effects in their solutions (such as the large resistivity
required to form centrifugal discs in Krasnopolsky et al., 2010 ) .

The second and more commonly discussed mechanism for solving the
magnetic flux problem is ambipolar diffusion (see e.g. Mestel and
Spitzer, 1956 ; Mouschovias, 1991 ; Fiedler and Mouschovias, 1993 ; Basu
and Mouschovias, 1994 ; Shu and Li, 1997 , and many others) .
Simulations have shown that ambipolar diffusion is important during the
phase of collapse pre-point mass formation, when the mass-to-flux ratio
is still subcritical and the contraction is slow (see Section 1.3 );
however, the flux contained in a 1 M @xmath region of a molecular cloud
core at point mass formation is still @xmath – @xmath times larger than
that of a typical 1 M @xmath protostar (Ciolek and Mouschovias, 1994 ,
1995 ) .

Further dissipation must then occur after the cloud becomes
supercritical and enters into the dynamic, near-free fall phase of
collapse, prior to or during the formation of a circumstellar disc.
Ambipolar diffusion allows the magnetic field to decouple from the
rapidly collapsing neutral particles at small radii, reducing the amount
of magnetic flux dragged into the origin (Li and McKee, 1996 ; Li, 1998
) ; in the numerical simulations of Desch and Mouschovias ( 2001 ) this
was demonstrated to such a degree that they concluded that the magnetic
flux problem could be solved by ambipolar diffusion alone. The earlier
numerical simulation of Ciolek and Königl ( 1998 ) had shown that the
rate of ambipolar diffusion is strongly increased during dynamical
collapse and causes a decrease in the magnetic field of over two orders
of magnitude (relative to the flux associated with the same mass of
pre-collapse gas) in their central object. The semianalytic solutions of
Li ( 1998 ) demonstrated that it was possible to find similarity
solutions for which there was no central flux when certain constraints
upon the coupling parameters, the degree of magnetisation and the
initial conditions of the core held true.

By considering the timescales for ambipolar and Ohmic diffusion at high
densities Nakano and Umebayashi ( 1986a , b ) , building on the
calculations of Pneuman and Mitchell ( 1965 ) , suggested that
significant flux loss could only occur during the dynamical phase of
core collapse by Ohmic dissipation, which is important once densities of
@xmath cm @xmath are achieved in the core. The ratio of the ambipolar
diffusion to Ohmic diffusion timescales depends upon the inverse square
of the magnetic field, so that as the field is weakened, Ohmic
dissipation will come to dominate over ambipolar diffusion at the later
stages when the density is high and the magnetic field has decoupled
from the gas (see Figure 1.3 ).

The Ohmic dissipation process has been shown to be more important than
vertical collapse (in which the gas infalls along the magnetic field
lines) in resolving the magnetic flux problem both analytically (Nakano
et al., 2002 ) and numerically (Machida et al., 2007 ) . Shu et al. (
2006 ) showed that for their semianalytic solution with a large
spatially-uniform Ohmic diffusion coefficient and numerical reconnection
the magnetic flux problem was resolved, and Tassis and Mouschovias (
2007a , b , c ) found that their numerical simulations of collapse with
ambipolar and Ohmic diffusion produced a magnetic field in the central
region ( @xmath AU) of about @xmath G when the central protostar has a
mass @xmath M @xmath , which is approaching that observed in
strongly-magnetic stars; their simulations were, however, unable to
follow the growth of the protostar to actual stellar masses.

Santos-Lima et al. ( 2010 ) performed numerical simulations comparing
the relative importance of ambipolar diffusion and “reconnection
diffusion”: the removal of flux from gravitating clouds by turbulent
reconnection (as outlined by Lazarian, 2005 ) . They showed that while
cores with low turbulence will be dominated by ambipolar diffusion,
cores that are more active will be subject to reconnection diffusion at
many densities, and that this will speed the quasistatic contraction of
the cloud core before dynamic collapse occurs. They also showed that
turbulent diffusivity behaved in a similar manner to enhanced Ohmic
diffusivity in non-turbulent simulations, aiding the removal of magnetic
flux from the collapsing fluid.

It seems likely that star formation requires all of these processes to a
greater or lesser degree. While individual solutions may demonstrate a
solved magnetic flux problem for particular controlled parameters, there
has been no complete solution that includes both ambipolar and Ohmic
diffusion, which are crucial to the magnetic field behaviour. Similarly,
these studies have disregarded the potential of Hall diffusion changing
the dynamics of collapse and aiding the resolution of the magnetic flux
problem at those intermediate densities between the ambipolar and Ohmic
diffusion regimes where Hall diffusion dominates (Wardle and Ng, 1999 )
.

It will be shown in Chapter 3 that no rotationally-supported disc can
form in certain Hall similarity solutions when the magnetic braking is
particularly strong. This “magnetic braking catastrophe” in which all of
the angular momentum of the collapsing material is removed so that there
is no rotational support and no inner Keplerian disc forms has been
observed in many numerical simulations (e.g. Krasnopolsky and Königl,
2002 ; Mellon and Li, 2009 ) and shall be discussed in more detail in
Section 6.2 . It may be resolved by the inclusion of Ohmic dissipation,
which reduces the amount of magnetic braking in the inner high density
regions of collapse, allowing rotationally-supported discs to form (Dapp
and Basu, 2010 ; Machida et al., 2011 ) . It will also be demonstrated
in Chapter 6 that it is possible to form larger Keplerian discs in the
Hall similarity solutions when the magnetic field is reversed (with
respect to the axis of rotation); in this situation the magnetic field
diffusion can increase the angular momentum of the collapsing gas,
spinning it up and changing the dynamics of the angular momentum problem
in molecular cloud cores that have low initial rotation rates.

### 1.6 The Hall Effect in Star Formation

Figure 1.3 showed the magnetic diffusion regimes of a weakly ionised
plasma, and indicated that Hall diffusion is important at intermediate
densities and field strengths such as those encountered in molecular
cloud cores. Wardle ( 2007 ) showed that in molecular clouds ions and
electrons were coupled to the field while the largest grains are not. As
the density increases the smaller grains and the ions also decouple from
the field, suggesting that Hall diffusion would become important after
molecular cloud cores start to collapse.

Within a fluid in which the Hall diffusion is dominant the ions (and
grains) are strongly tied to the neutral particles by collisions, which
also are responsible for transmitting the electromagnetic stresses to
the neutral particles. The current is dominated by the electrons, which
drift perpendicular to the magnetic and electric fields so that the net
Lorentz force is zero. Collisions with the neutrals and
oppositely-charged grains have negligible effect on the electron motion
(Wardle and Ng, 1999 ) .

The drift velocity of the magnetic field in a weakly ionised medium is
given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the current density, defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

and @xmath is the component of @xmath that is perpendicular to the
magnetic field. The diffusivities @xmath are those for Ohmic, ambipolar
and Hall diffusion respectively — these determine the coupling between
the gas and the field, and shall be discussed in more detail in Chapter
2 . Clearly, this can be divided into two velocities, that caused by
Hall diffusion of the field,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

and that of ambipolar and Ohmic diffusion,

  -- -- -- --------
           (1.14)
  -- -- -- --------

For a thin disc such as that illustrated in Figure 1.5 , the magnetic
field has been pulled into a pinched configuration by the initial
collapse under IMHD; this field shape is expected from simulations of
gravitational collapse under a variety of conditions (e.g. Galli and
Shu, 1993a , b ) and observations (e.g. Cortes and Crutcher, 2006 ;
Gonçalves et al., 2008 ) . It is only once the density has built up that
ambipolar and Hall diffusion start to become important (e.g. Desch and
Mouschovias, 2001 ; Wardle, 2004a ) . This pinching produces a strong
toroidal current as indicated by Equation 1.12 , which causes Hall
diffusion in the azimuthal direction (Equation 1.13 ).

Hall diffusion twists up the field and in turn changes the angular
momentum of the neutral fluid, which in a rotationally-supported disc
causes the gas to fall inwards if it loses angular momentum, or outwards
if it gains it. The direction in which the field diffuses is determined
by the initial orientation of the field with respect to the axis of
rotation, and the field drifts in the opposite direction if the initial
direction of the field is reversed. Ambipolar and Ohmic diffusion,
however, always cause the field to move in the radial direction against
the flow of the neutrals — reversing the direction of the field does not
affect the direction of the field diffusion.

Under Hall diffusion any radial field drift causes an increase in the
azimuthal field and correspondingly the angular momentum, tying together
the angular momentum and magnetic flux problems outlined in previous
sections. It provides a mechanism for resolving both of these problems
in simulations of star formation, yet because of the numerical
difficulties it incurs and the previous assumption that it would not be
important, Hall diffusion is only just starting to be included in
simulations of collapsing molecular cloud cores (e.g. Krasnopolsky
et al., 2011 ) . The inclusion of Hall diffusion in the semianalytic
collapse model will provide a better understanding of the collapse and
disc dynamics in observed cores, and shall show that the Hall effect can
help resolve the magnetic braking catastrophe, as will be discussed
further in Section 6.2 .

### 1.7 Project Outline

This project aims to find similarity solutions for the gravitational
collapse of rotating, isothermal, magnetic molecular cloud cores that
are similar to those of Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) but with Hall
diffusion included in the conductivity tensor. Krasnopolsky and Königl (
2002 ) adopted a conductivity that contained only ambipolar diffusion,
but it has been shown that the Hall diffusion term is important at many
of the intermediate densities found during gravitational collapse
(Wardle, 2004a ) . Hall diffusion also significantly alters the vector
evolution of the magnetic field (see Figure 1.2 ), and it is Hall
diffusion that is of particular interest here, especially in contrast
with the ambipolar and Ohmic diffusion terms.

In Chapter 2 the problem of gravitational collapse is properly set out
and the self-similar MHD equations are derived under the assumptions of
isothermality, axisymmetry, that the forming pseudodisc is thin and
others describing the magnetic field behaviour. These assumptions are
discussed in detail and the outer boundary conditions (corresponding
also to the initial conditions of the core, due to the self-similar
nature of the problem) are derived with values chosen to be compatible
with both observations and three-dimensional numerical collapse
simulations.

Chapter 3 derives the inner asymptotic solutions, which function as the
second set of boundary conditions for the collapse problem (at the inner
edge and infinite time). These inner similarity solutions are power law
descriptions of a Keplerian accretion disc which is supported by the
influence of both Hall and ambipolar diffusion, and a rapidly infalling
solution in which the material falls directly onto the central star
without forming a disc. These similarity solutions demonstrate the
restrictions that must be placed upon the Hall and ambipolar diffusion
parameters in order to find the true solutions, as the handedness of the
magnetic response (shown in Figure 1.2 ) can lead to unphysical
solutions if the adopted nondimensional Hall diffusion parameter is too
large with respect to the ambipolar diffusion parameter and the
orientation of the magnetic field.

Chapter 4 describes the construction of the self-similar model in stages
of increasing complexity, duplicating the results of Krasnopolsky and
Königl ( 2002 ) and comparing these with numerical simulations. The
iterative code that numerically integrates the self-similar equations
and solves the boundary condition problem is outlined, as well as the
approximations used to estimate the positions of the magnetic diffusion
and centrifugal shocks. The similarity solutions to collapse models that
have no magnetic field, ideal magnetohydrodynamics or only ambipolar
diffusion are then presented and analysed; these are used to demonstrate
that the size of the rotationally-supported disc and the accretion rate
onto the protostar depend upon the initial rotation rate and the amount
of magnetic braking in the core.

The main results of the project are presented in Chapter 5 , where the
similarity solutions for the expanded model with the full conductivity
tensor are explored. Further details of the modelling process are
described, including simplifications adopted to calculate initial values
of the variables at a matching point (to increase the likelihood of
convergence onto the true solutions) and modifications to the equation
set that are necessary near the inner boundary. The importance of Hall
diffusion to the collapse process is compared with the ambipolar term
that was previously expected to dominate the magnetic field behaviour in
the earlier stages of collapse. In particular, Hall diffusion is shown
to introduce additional shock fronts interior to the magnetic diffusion
and centrifugal shocks that alter the dynamics of the collapse.

The primary results of this thesis are summarised and discussed in more
detail in Chapter 6 , where the limitations of the model and the
assumptions supporting it are considered in the context of the results.
The difference in the behaviour and size of the protostar and Keplerian
disc are examined with respect to the boundary conditions of the core
and the diffusion coefficients. Depending upon the orientation of the
magnetic field with respect to the axis of rotation, Hall diffusion is
shown to change the size of the Keplerian disc by an order of magnitude,
and can increase the accretion rate onto the protostar. Hall diffusion
is also shown to have a clear impact on the magnetic braking catastrophe
— enhancing it by further decreasing the angular momentum of the
collapsing flow so that no disc forms, or changing the magnetic braking
behaviour to the point where Hall diffusion can induce rotation in
initially nonrotating flows, again depending upon the orientation of the
field. Observational tests of this model are proposed and suggestions
for future work expanding the model by better calculating the vertical
angular momentum transport and adopting a different scaling in
self-similar space for the nondimensional Hall diffusion parameter are
presented. Finally, the conclusions of this work and its implications
will be summarised, emphasising that the Hall effect is indeed important
in studies of star formation.

## Chapter 2 Self-Similar Gravitational Collapse

Simulations of gravitational collapse are some of the most important
tools available for studying star formation. Numerical simulations,
while increasingly able to model complex physics across a wide range of
densities, are limited in resolution. Due to the computational costs of
these, only the most typical regions of parameter space are able to be
explored; novel or otherwise interesting solutions may be overlooked as
typical values of the model parameters are adopted.

Semianalytic simulations are instead able to model solutions with very
high resolution rapidly, so that it is possible to explore larger
regions of parameter space. This is achieved by reducing the
dimensionality of the problem and sacrificing some of the featured
physics. A semianalytic model then is the optimal choice for studying a
simplified collapse problem with Hall diffusion, so that the parameter
space can be quickly explored and the prospects for future research in
numerical simulations identified.

The goal of this work is to construct a semianalytic model of
gravitational collapse similar to that of Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002
) but including terms for Hall diffusion in the equations for the
magnetic field diffusion and braking. This will allow the calculation of
similarity solutions that show the importance of Hall diffusion in
molecular cloud cores and collapsing flows, as well as comparisons
between the influence of the Hall and ambipolar diffusion terms. These
solutions will then be used to motivate the inclusion of Hall diffusion
in numerical models of star formation and protostellar discs.

This chapter describes the derivation of the self-similar equations, and
the set of initial (outer) boundary conditions that describe a molecular
cloud core which is magnetically supercritical and in the process of
contracting slowly in the radial direction. The MHD equations are
presented in cylindrical coordinates and the assumptions that must be
adopted to ensure that self-similarity holds are outlined. These
assumptions include isothermality, which guarantees that the sound speed
in the core is constant, and axisymmetry, which is adopted to reduce the
dimensionality of the problem, The core is then assumed to be a thin
disc, so that the equations may be averaged over the scale height of the
collapsing flow — this further reduces the dimensionality of the problem
so that the MHD variables then depend only on the radius and time. The
prescriptions for the radial and azimuthal field components are derived,
and the azimuthal term is shown to control the magnetic braking of
angular momentum, which slows the rotation of the inner regions of the
core by transporting angular momentum to the external envelope.

Finally, the equations are self-similarised by choosing a similarity
variable that is a function of @xmath and @xmath and adopting
nondimensional scalings of the fluid variables so that they become
functions of the similarity variable. The MHD equations can then be
written in terms of the nondimensional variables, and once the outer
boundary conditions are modified to reflect this self-similarity, it is
then possible to integrate the one-dimension equations and find
similarity solutions that shall provide new insight into the star
formation process.

### 2.1 Basic Equations

The methods of Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) are used to simplify and
rearrange the MHD equations into the self-similar form in which the
equations depend only upon the nondimensional similarity variable,
@xmath , and are one-dimensional ordinary differential equations. The
principal difference between this work and theirs is the inclusion of
the full conductivity tensor in the induction equation, rather than just
the ambipolar diffusion term. The vertical angular momentum transport is
also modified by the inclusion of a Hall diffusion term.

The magnetohydrodynamics equations are:

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.1)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.2)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.3)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the gas density, @xmath the velocity field, @xmath the
pressure, @xmath the gravitational field, @xmath the gravitational
potential, @xmath the speed of light, @xmath the current, @xmath the
magnetic field, @xmath is the unit vector in the direction of @xmath ,
and @xmath are the respective diffusion coefficients for the Ohmic, Hall
and ambipolar terms in the induction equation.

To simplify the calculations of the collapsing cloud core, the axis of
rotation is aligned with the background magnetic field. The external
cloud medium is characterised by constant low density, thermal pressure
and angular velocity.

Using cylindrical coordinates, under the assumptions of isothermality
(that @xmath ) and axisymmetry (that the derivatives with respect to
@xmath are equal to zero), the mass, radial momentum, and angular
momentum conservation relations, as well as the hydrostatic equilibrium
equation and the induction equation are given by:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are the radial and vertical components of the
gravitational field, and @xmath is the isothermal sound speed given by
@xmath km s @xmath (with @xmath the Boltzmann constant, @xmath the gas
temperature, typically taken to be @xmath K, and @xmath the mean mass of
a gas particle). For the sake of comparison, the sound speed is denoted
@xmath in many papers (including Krasnopolsky and Königl, 2002, and
others such as Ciolek and Mouschovias, 1993 ; Kunz and Mouschovias, 2010
, etc) , and @xmath in others (e.g. Shu et al., 1987 ; Galli et al.,
2006 ; Mellon and Li, 2009 , etc) . The notation adopted here matches
that of Norman and Heyvaerts ( 1985 ) , Wardle and Ng ( 1999 ) and
Pandey and Wardle ( 2008 ) , which was originally chosen in order to
differentiate the sound speed from the speed of light ( @xmath , no
subscript).

### 2.2 Assumptions

A number of assumptions must be made to simplify the equations to the
point that they are ordinary differential equations that can be solved
semianalytically. These assumptions are justified below.

The cloud, pseudodisc and inner disc are all rotating slowly, and
because of this it is possible to assume that axisymmetry (that the
partial derivatives with respect to the azimuthal angle are equal to
zero) holds true; this is not expected to introduce significant errors
to the simulations. This assumption makes it impossible to include
direct calculations of nonaxisymmetric effects such as fragmentation or
turbulence, which are important in studies of high-mass star formation
(e.g. Mac Low and Klessen, 2004 ; Ballesteros-Paredes et al., 2007 ) but
are less relevant to the collapse of smaller isolated cores into
low-mass stars such as those studied in this work.

The nonaxisymmetric core collapse calculations of Basu and Ciolek ( 2004
) found that the cores formed were near-oblate or triaxial rather than
prolate, however, the timescales, infall speeds and mass-to-flux ratios
in their cores were compatible with those from axisymmetric
calculations. The three-dimensional non-ideal MHD calculations of
Machida et al. ( 2007 ) showed that in their rapidly-rotating collapses
the thin disc is occasionally transformed into a bar by nonaxisymmetric
effects, and that this bar may fragment at later stages of the collapse,
however, they too were able to form discs with behaviour that did not
vary with azimuth. The assumption of axisymmetry in this model is
required in order to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to a
one-dimensional self-similar equation set, and as near-axisymmetric
collapse occurs in three-dimensional models this assumption is
considered generally to be appropriate everywhere, except potentially in
the inner disc regions.

The magnetic field and the axis of rotation are assumed to be aligned,
which is not necessarily supported by observations of molecular cloud
cores, although it is a common and accepted simplification of the
problem in theoretical studies. Theoretical simulations have shown that
the combination of aligned rotation axis and magnetic field leads to the
formation of molecular cloud cores that have oblate shapes that match
observations (Ciolek and Mouschovias, 1993 ; Goodwin et al., 2002 ) .
Observations of the magnetic field orientation and the rotation of cores
(e.g. Vink et al., 2005 ) have yet to provide a decisive answer on this
matter, but the observations of the binary protostellar system NGC 1333
IRAS 4A by Girart et al. ( 2006 ) showed that the axis normal to the
envelope surrounding the binary lay between the outflow and the magnetic
field axes, which suggests that the spin and magnetic field axes were
not in alignment when collapse was initiated. These analyses were
supported by further observations by Attard et al. ( 2009 ) and
modelling by Gonçalves et al. ( 2008 ) , which showed that the field in
this core possesses the classic hourglass shape, even though it is not
aligned with the outflow from the binary star.

The simulations of Price and Bate ( 2007 ) , Hennebelle and Ciardi (
2009 ) and Ciardi and Hennebelle ( 2010 ) have shown that the angle
between the rotation axis and the magnetic field influences the dynamics
of collapse, and could prevent the formation of a rotationally-supported
disc. Disc formation in calculations with high initial magnetic flux
occurred most often when the magnetic field and axis of rotation were
orthogonal due to the reduced magnetic braking caused by the field.
Given these results, it would appear that a better choice for the
initial shape of the magnetic field would see it lie at an angle to the
rotational axis, however by definition this would violate axisymmetry,
which, as stated previously, is necessary for one-dimensional
self-similarity.

The assumption that the pseudodisc is thin is based upon the results of
Fiedler and Mouschovias ( 1992 , 1993 ) and the many other simulations
of Mouschovias and coworkers, which have shown that an initially
uniform, self-gravitating, magnetised molecular cloud core that is
spherically or cylindrically-symmetric rapidly flattens along magnetic
field lines. This assumption allows for a further reduction in the
dimensionality of the problem, although again it implies that effects
that depend on variation in the density or magnetic field with height
within the disc cannot be included in the collapse calculation. Such
processes may include turbulence and interactions between active and
dead zones in the disc that are caused by the differential (with respect
to @xmath and @xmath ) ionisation of the disc by external sources
(Pudritz et al., 2007 ) . They are not expected to have a large effect
on the overall dynamics of early collapse, but they may again become
important in the innermost regions of protostellar discs in the later
stages of collapse once the adiabatic core and protostar have formed.

Isothermality is required for self-similarity, as the similarity
variable @xmath is defined in terms of the isothermal sound speed,
@xmath . This assumption breaks down due to radiative trapping when the
central density reaches values @xmath cm @xmath (Gaustad, 1963 ) . For a
typical simulation of the collapse of a nonrotating molecular cloud core
this occurs on scales @xmath AU, which is several orders of magnitude
smaller than the size of the average core, and so nonmagnetic or
nonrotating simulations (e.g. Ciolek and Königl, 1998 ) and numerical
simulations (e.g. Tassis and Mouschovias, 2005a , b ) often treat the
inner region as point-like.

By treating the forming protostar and the region around it as a central
sink cell into which the infalling matter disappears, it is possible to
avoid having to deal with complications such as the breakdown of
isothermality and the difficulty of tracking regions of high density in
grid-based calculations. The breakdown of isothermality is usually
treated by adopting an adiabatic equation of state once a critical
density is exceeded in the inner region of the collapse, as a way of
avoiding the computational expense of performing radiative transfer
calculations (e.g. Machida et al., 2007 , 2008a ; Tassis and
Mouschovias, 2007a , b , c ) . It is now possible to perform some full
radiative transfer simulations, but usually at the expense of magnetic
field behaviour or grid resolution (e.g. Krumholz and McKee, 2008 ; Kunz
and Mouschovias, 2009 , 2010 ; Price and Bate, 2009 ) .

Isothermality breaks down in the inner disc region of the self-similar
collapse calculations of Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) , as the
surface density in their quasistatic Keplerian disc is much higher than
that in the preceding near-free fall stage. They estimated that
radiative trapping occurs on scales @xmath AU, although irradiation by
the central protostar would mitigate this to maintain vertical
isothermality in the outer regions of the disc. However, this same
irradiation establishes a @xmath variation in temperature in the
innermost regions of the disc (D’Alessio et al., 1998 ) . While this
obviously means that self-similarity could break down in the innermost
regions of this disc, thermal stresses do not play a significant role in
the larger-scale core collapse dynamics and the assumption of
isothermality is not expected to introduce significant inaccuracies into
the overall results.

The pressure support that could be provided by internal turbulence is
neglected, as it cannot be directly calculated due to the dimensional
simplifications adopted and any parameterisation possible within the
self-similar framework would be so simplistic as to render it useless as
a measure of the influence of turbulence on collapse simulations. As
with all the other assumptions on the collapsing material, this is
unlikely to introduce large errors into the calculations.

### 2.3 Vertical Averaging

In order to simplify the calculations and reduce the problem to one that
depends only on @xmath and @xmath , the pseudodisc is assumed to be
geometrically thin with a half-thickness @xmath , and Equations 2.6 –
2.10 are vertically averaged by integrating over @xmath .

The density, radial velocity, azimuthal velocity and radial gravity are
taken to be constant with height, and the surface density of the
pseudodisc is defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

while the specific angular momentum is given by the equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is assumed that the thin disc is threaded by an open magnetic field
configuration possessing an even symmetry:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.13)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.14)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.15)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

clearly @xmath at the midplane of the disc. Where they are not held
constant with height the other physical variables are assumed to be
reflection-symmetric about the midplane.

The solenoidal condition on the magnetic field (derived from Gauss’ law
for magnetic fields, Equation 2.4, under the assumption of axisymmetry)
is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

This implies that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the variation of @xmath from @xmath to @xmath is then

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the value of @xmath at the surface of the disc. Assuming
that @xmath is the dominant field component (that @xmath , which is not
always true although the terms are always of the same order of
magnitude), and that @xmath , then

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

so the variation of @xmath within the disc is small (Lovelace et al.,
1994 ) . It is then possible to treat @xmath in the thin disc as being
constant with height during the vertical averaging; the solenoidal
condition is used to average any terms in which @xmath appears.

The other field components are assumed to scale as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the surface value of the azimuthal field component,
@xmath ; these scalings are motivated by the field configuration of a
rotationally-supported thin disc in which the field is comparatively
well-coupled to the gas (Wardle and Königl, 1993 ) . While this holds
true in the outer regions of the collapse, this approximation is no
longer adequate to describe the field behaviour in the inner regions of
the disc where the field is only weakly-coupled to the fluid (Li, 1996 ;
Wardle, 1997 ) . However, as none of the dominant terms in the equation
set depend upon the particulars of the vertical variation of the field
within the disc, it is reasonable to adopt these scalings across the
domain of the self-similar collapse (Krasnopolsky and Königl, 2002 ) . A
better method of handing the field variation with height in the disc
should be explored in future research.

The radial component of gravity, @xmath , is taken from the monopole
expression

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the enclosed mass @xmath when the central mass dominates. This was
found by Contopoulos et al. ( 1998 ) to be near enough to the value
given for the radial gravitational force by an iterative calculation
method that it could be used without correction terms in their
self-similar model. Following their work, the monopole expression for
gravity is similarly adopted here (as in Krasnopolsky and Königl, 2002 )
, with little expectation that it will introduce significant errors into
the calculation.

In the interest of keeping this text readable, each of the MHD equations
is treated separately below.

#### 2.3.1 Conservation of mass

Using Equation 2.11 , the equation of continuity (Equation 2.6 )
integrates to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the term on the right hand side represents the mass flux in a disc
wind with total outflow rate @xmath within a radius @xmath , defined by
the relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

The calculations presented here do not include a disc wind, so this term
is now set to zero. A discussion of how a nonzero outflow mass flux
could be incorporated into the work in future is included in Chapter 6
(see also appendix C of Krasnopolsky and Königl, 2002 ) .

#### 2.3.2 Conservation of radial momentum

With the approximation that @xmath is constant with height, the final
term in the radial momentum conservation equation (Equation 2.7 ),
@xmath , vanishes. Applying the approximations outlined above and
integrating the rest of the radial momentum conservation equation over
@xmath gives

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.25)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

where the final integral cannot be integrated as easily as the terms on
the first line of the equation.

The first term in the integral is integrated by rewriting the inner
derivative as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

the scaling of @xmath given in Equation 2.20 and the solenoidal
condition (Equation 2.16 ) are then applied so that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

and finally the first term in this equation can be integrated over the
disc scale height and the second term simplified to give

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

The second term in the integral in 2.25 is then integrated using the
assumption that @xmath is constant with height:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

and this and Equation 2.28 are then substituted into Equation 2.25 :

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.30)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

The last term of Equation 2.30 is evaluated over the finite interval of
the disc height, @xmath , as the mass is distributed only between the
boundaries of the disc. This integral is then solved by parts:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

(Lovelace et al., 1994 ) . The vertical scalings for the field
components ( 2.20 – 2.21 ) are substituted into this, and the integral
on the right hand side of Equation 2.31 then becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

the derivative on the left of this equation is then expanded out so that
the integral becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

All of the above terms are collected together so that the radial
momentum conservation equation is thus

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.34)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Rearranging this and substituting in the monopole approximation for
@xmath (given in Equation 2.22 ) gives the full vertically-averaged
radial momentum conservation equation:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.35)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

#### 2.3.3 Conservation of angular momentum

As in the case of the radial momentum, the final term in the angular
momentum conservation equation (Equation 2.8 ), @xmath , vanishes as
@xmath is constant with respect to @xmath . By rearranging the equation
and applying the solenoidal condition to the partial derivatives of
@xmath with respect to @xmath , the angular momentum equation becomes:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

this equation is integrated over @xmath to give

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the same methods as for the radial momentum conservation equation,
the integral on the right hand side of Equation 2.37 becomes

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.38)
  -- -- -- --------

Substituting this and Equation 2.12 for the specific angular momentum
into Equation 2.37 , and rearranging the terms once more gives the final
version of the vertically-averaged angular momentum conservation
equation:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 2.3.4 Vertical hydrostatic balance

The gas pressure is assumed to vanish at the disc surface. The pressure
at the midplane of the disc is approximated by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

Because the disc is thin, it is assumed that all accretion onto it in
the vertical direction has already taken place, so that @xmath and all
of the terms in Equation 2.9 that feature it vanish. The vertical
hydrostatic balance equation, when integrated, becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

The vertical component of gravity, @xmath , is approximated by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the first term is the local disc self-gravity, and the other is
the tidal squeezing by the central point mass. This is then substituted
into Equation 2.41 , which is rearranged to give

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

the final form of the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium equation.

#### 2.3.5 @xmath-component of the induction equation

The preceding four derivations produce the same equations as their
counterparts in Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) . As the focus of this
work is to adopt a more complete induction equation than has been
modelled previously, which contains terms for the ambipolar, Hall and
Ohmic diffusion of the magnetic field, the simplifications that affect
the induction equation must be closely examined. This will ensure that
the similarity solutions obtained properly explore how Hall diffusion of
the field affects star formation.

The @xmath -component of the induction equation (Equation 2.10 ) is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is expanded into the form

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.45)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath . As before, it is assumed that the solutions
are axisymmetric, so that all partial derivatives with respect to @xmath
are zero. The vertical mass flux was defined to be equal to zero, so the
vertical component of the gas velocity is @xmath . Applying these
assumptions and expanding out the right hand side further gives

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

which becomes

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.47)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

The magnetic flux enclosed within a radius @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the flux within the central point mass. This equation is
then rewritten in differential form as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

and its derivative with respect to time is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is substituted into Equation 2.47 and the partial derivative with
respect to @xmath and the factor of @xmath are cancelled to obtain

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.51)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

In dealing with the partial derivatives with respect to @xmath , such as
the @xmath term above, care must be taken to ensure that the vertical
scaling of all of the variables is properly accounted for. As such, the
integration is presented with more intermediate steps than in the
previous calculations.

The @xmath terms depend on @xmath respectively, so the leading fractions
of the diffusive terms may be ignored as the integration over @xmath is
performed.

The flux, magnetic force and Ohmic diffusion terms are integrated over
@xmath to give:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.54)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

The Hall diffusion terms are rearranged into the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the vertical scaling of the azimuthal field component is substituted
into the first term and the solenoidal condition (Equation 2.16 ) is
applied to the second:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

The integral of the Hall terms may then by written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

which, after the vertical scalings of @xmath and @xmath are substituted
into it, is evaluated to give:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.58)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Finally, the ambipolar diffusion terms are expanded out and integrated.
The first of these terms is straightforward, as @xmath is regarded as
constant with height unless specifically differentiated with respect to
@xmath and may be taken outside of the integral, which is solved to
obtain

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath               
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.59)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

The second of the ambipolar diffusion terms is rearranged into the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

to which the solenoidal condition (Equation 2.16 ) and the scalings for
the other field components are applied. The integral of this term is
then

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.61)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

this is evaluated over the height of the disc to give

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.62)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

The third of the ambipolar diffusion terms is again straightforward; it
is vertically-averaged by applying the vertical scalings to the radial
and azimuthal components to the field and then performing the integral
over @xmath to find

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.63)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Finally, the last of the ambipolar diffusion terms in Equation 2.51 is
averaged by substituting in the vertical scalings of the field
components and then performing the integral:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.64)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Collecting all of these integrated terms into the same order as in
Equation 2.51 then gives the full vertically-averaged induction
equation:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (2.65)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- --------

It is clear from this equation that the azimuthal field is pivotal in
causing Hall drift in the radial direction; @xmath should not be
neglected, even in axisymmetric models.

#### 2.3.6 Radial field component, @xmath

Contopoulos et al. ( 1998 ) found that, as with the radial component of
gravity, one could calculate @xmath iteratively for more accurate
similarity solutions, however the behaviour of the disc at @xmath was
sufficiently well described by the monopole expression that they did not
need to adopt a more complete method of calculating the radial field
component. Following their example the monopole approximation to @xmath
is also adopted here to simplify the calculation of the field:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.66)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

This simplification, which was also used by Krasnopolsky and Königl (
2002 ) , is not expected to introduce any significant errors to the
calculations.

### 2.4 Vertical Angular Momentum Transport

The vertical angular momentum transport above and within the pseudodisc
is achieved by magnetic braking, especially during the dynamic collapse
phase inwards of the magnetic diffusion shock. It is assumed that
magnetic braking remains the dominant angular momentum transport
mechanism during the subsequent evolution of the core, although it is
likely that a centrifugally-driven disc wind may dominate in the
innermost rotationally-supported disc. The approach to modelling the
magnetic braking adopted here is adapted from that of Basu and
Mouschovias ( 1994 ) for the pre-point mass formation collapse phase.
This formulation is not well-defined in the innermost
rotationally-supported regions of the disc, where the calculated
magnetic braking becomes stronger than is expected and the angular
momentum transport is expected to be dominated by a disc wind (this is
discussed in more detail in Chapter 6 ). A cap is then placed upon the
azimuthal magnetic field component in order to ensure that it does not
greatly exceed the vertical component; because of this the magnetic
braking prescription is not expected to introduce significant errors
into the inner regions of the calculations.

The geometry of the magnetic field is illustrated in Figure 2.1 ; the
magnetic field is frozen into the low-density, constant-pressure
external medium, which has density @xmath and angular velocity @xmath .
Within the external medium the magnetic field assumes the value @xmath ,
and the exterior flux tubes corotate with the core. Because the
transition region has a low moment of inertia relative to the core, and
the crossing time for Alfvén waves is always much smaller than the
evolutionary time of the core, the transition region can relax to a
steady state during all stages of contraction (Basu and Mouschovias,
1994 ) .

The induction equation under IMHD implies that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the poloidal field, so that the angular velocity @xmath
is constant on a magnetic surface. The force equation is similarly
reduced to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.68)
  -- -------- -- --------

which further implies that @xmath does not change along the field lines.
The neutral particles carry the torque and angular momentum is carried
upwards by torsional Alfvén waves generated by the rotation of the disc.

Over a period of time @xmath an amount of material equal to @xmath moves
from the undisturbed position @xmath in the external medium along a flux
tube with angular velocity @xmath to a radius @xmath at the disc
surface. The angular momentum of the gas goes as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.69)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath , the external Alfvén speed, is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.70)
  -- -------- -- --------

For purely azimuthal motions in the external medium, the total angular
momentum in each flux tube is conserved. This angular momentum must be
removed from the disc at a rate equal to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.71)
  -- -------- -- --------

which gives a torque on the disc equal to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.72)
  -- -------- -- --------

The amount of flux remains constant along flux tubes, so that the flux
through the disc inside of a radius @xmath is equal to the amount of
flux through the cylindrical external cloud inside of the radius @xmath
:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.73)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the value of @xmath at the midplane of the disc. Thus

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.74)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.75)
  -- -------- -- --------

so that the torque in Equation 2.72 becomes

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.76)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

The torque per unit area on the disc is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.77)
  -- -------- -- --------

and combining Equations 2.76 and 2.77 gives the steady state azimuthal
component of the magnetic field at the surface of the disc:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.78)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is clear that the properties of the external medium determine the
conditions at the disc surface. This steady state approximation requires
that the ratio of the Alfvén travel time in the external medium to the
initial radius of the cloud be less than the evolutionary timescale,
which scales with @xmath as @xmath . For the rotationally-supported
discs presented in this work @xmath (and @xmath as @xmath ), which is
much smaller than @xmath , the Alfvén speed for the adopted temperature
in the gas of 10K; this implies that the assumption of rapid braking of
the core should not introduce large errors into the solutions.

The angular velocity @xmath is given by the equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.79)
  -- -------- -- --------

where, using @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.80)
  -- -------- -- --------

This equation is then expanded out to become

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.81)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

which is then vertically-integrated over the thin disc as in subsection
2.3.5 to obtain

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.82)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Most of the terms in Equation 2.81 have direct analogies in Equation
2.51 , and the individual steps of the integration are not reproduced
here.

This equation is simplified by omitting any terms of order @xmath save
for the @xmath term, which is important in refining the structure of the
magnetic diffusion shock. This simplification is explained in more
detail and justified below in Section 2.5 ; and the final form of @xmath
is then:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.83)
  -- -------- -- --------

this equation is equivalent to the ion-neutral drift velocity adopted by
Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 , equation 9) , with the inclusion of
terms describing the effect of Hall diffusion.

The @xmath term is then dropped from Equation 2.78 as the molecular
cloud rotation rate is slow compared with that of the collapsing
material. Rotation is dynamically important in the inner regions of the
solutions presented in this thesis, while it is not important in most
molecular clouds (see Section 1.1 and the references therein), so it is
reasonable to declare that @xmath and dismiss @xmath as small.

The external Alfvén speed, @xmath , is treated as a constant with
respect to the isothermal sound speed in these calculations, and is
parameterised by the formula

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.84)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a constant, typically of order @xmath in the solutions.
This scaling of @xmath is also a reasonable assumption, as the
observations by Crutcher ( 1999 ) indicated that @xmath km s @xmath over
at least four orders of magnitude in density ( @xmath – @xmath cm @xmath
) in their observed molecular clouds.

Equations 2.83 and 2.84 are substituted into 2.78 to find that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.85)
  -- -------- -- --------

Note that @xmath , so that the terms featuring @xmath have an implied
@xmath dependence. This is typically solved for numerically when
calculating the azimuthal field component.

For the inner solutions, @xmath increases with decreasing @xmath
(proportional to @xmath in the Keplerian disc solution and @xmath in the
free fall solution); this would make @xmath the dominant field component
at the surface near to the central point mass. Such behaviour is not
expected in a real disc, where internal kinks of the field and
magnetohydrodynamical instabilities (for example, the magnetorotational
instability) should reduce the value of @xmath at the surface. An
artificial limit on @xmath is imposed so that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.86)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a parameter of the model usually chosen to be @xmath in
order to ensure that the azimuthal field component does not exceed the
vertical component. Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) point out that this
value quite conveniently corresponds to that expected for a
rotationally-supported ambipolar diffusive disc where the vertical
angular momentum transport is dominated by a centrifugally-driven wind.

Applying this cap to Equation 2.85 then gives the final equation for
@xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.87)
  -- -------- -- --------

### 2.5 Further Simplifications

The disc equations are further simplified by recognising that the thin
disc approximation adopted earlier states that @xmath , this in turn
means that terms of order @xmath are small in comparison with other
terms and can then be dropped from the equations.

The only term of order @xmath that was found to influence the solutions
of Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) was the @xmath term in the radial
momentum equation, which was necessary to refine the structure of the
magnetic diffusion shock. A similar result is obtained in these
solutions, and the term is retained in all of the equations in which it
appears, including Equation 2.83 where it is the dominant component of
the Hall diffusion term in @xmath .

It is expected that @xmath will generally be the dominant field
component within the disc, although due to the cap placed upon @xmath
and the monopole approximation adopted for @xmath it may not be the
dominant term at the disc surface. In order to reproduce the results and
equations of Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) , the @xmath terms are
kept preferentially over those of the other field components of the same
order in the induction and azimuthal field drift equations.

Taking all of these into account gives the simplified set of equations:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.88)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.89)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.90)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.91)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.92)
  -- -------- -- --------

### 2.6 Self-Similar Form of the Equations

With the assumption that the disc is axisymmetric and thin, the collapse
behaviour resembles the shape of the inside-out collapse models
described in Chapter 1 , where at any instant in time the solution looks
like a stretched version of itself at previous times; this fractal-like
behaviour is referred to as self-similarity. The pseudodisc forms as a
collapse wave (referred to as the magnetic diffusion shock) propagates
outwards at the speed of sound, and similarly the outer boundary of the
inner rotationally-supported disc or free fall collapse region moves
outwards at the sound speed.

Gravitational collapse occurs over many orders of magnitude in radius
and density, so that the point mass has negligible dimensions in
comparison with the accretion flow. The self-similarity of the waves of
infall arises because of the lack of characteristic time and length
scales in the flow. The only dimensional quantities that effect the flow
are the magnetic field @xmath , the diffusion coefficients @xmath , the
gravitational constant @xmath , the isothermal sound speed @xmath , the
local radius @xmath and the instantaneous time @xmath ; this means that,
except for scaling factors, all of the flow variables may be written as
functions of a similarity variable @xmath , which is defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.93)
  -- -------- -- --------

At a temperature of @xmath K in a molecular cloud core of typical
composition, @xmath km s @xmath ; Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) noted
that for this value of the sound speed @xmath corresponds to a distance
of @xmath cm (400 AU) when @xmath yr (which is the characteristic age of
a Class 0 YSO) and to a distance of @xmath cm (4,000 AU) when @xmath yr
(the age of a Class 1 YSO). The Class 0 YSO IRAM 04191 has a dense inner
disc-like structure that resembles a tilted ring with an average radius
of @xmath AU (Lee et al., 2005 ) — this is of the same order of
magnitude as the centrifugal shock radius in the disc-forming solutions
at the same age.

The physical quantities are then expressed as the product of a
nondimensional flow variable that depends only upon @xmath and a
dimensional part constructed from @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . These
are:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.94)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.95)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.96)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.97)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.98)
     @xmath   @xmath                        (2.99)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

These equations take the same form and notation as those in Krasnopolsky
and Königl ( 2002 ) , with the addition of extra diffusion coefficients
to model the magnetic field diffusion more completely.

The Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion terms scale together, to a
zeroth-order approximation, as they possess a similar dependence upon
@xmath and appear in the induction equation and the azimuthal field
component equation multiplied with the same magnetic field terms.
Because the field within the thin disc is effectively vertical, both
ambipolar and Ohmic diffusion influence the field drift in the same
manner (see Figure 1.1 ). While one type of diffusion may dominate over
the other at any individual point in the disc (in general, ambipolar
diffusion dominates in the outer regions where the density is low and
Ohmic diffusion dominates in the innermost regions where the density is
high), only one term is needed in order to study the change in the disc
behaviour introduced by the Hall diffusion term that is of most interest
in this work. The Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion terms are then combined
into a single term parameterised by the dimensionless constant @xmath ,
that for simplifying the discussion is referred to as the ambipolar
diffusion parameter.

The ambipolar diffusion coefficient in a molecular cloud core without
grains is given (in cgs units) by the equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.100)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the neutral-ion momentum exchange timescale,
parameterised as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.101)
  -- -------- -- ---------

the nondimensional ambipolar diffusion parameter @xmath is a constant of
the model (simply denoted @xmath in the solutions of Krasnopolsky and
Königl, 2002 ) . @xmath is then self-similarised using the scalings
above to give

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.102)
  -- -------- -- ---------

it is important to note that the self-similarity of the solution depends
upon the relationship @xmath as discussed in Section 1.2 (and Elmegreen,
1979 ) .

As a matter of pragmatism, a similar scaling with respect to the density
and scale height is adopted for the Hall diffusion parameter, @xmath .
By stating that the self-similar Hall diffusion coefficient scales as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.103)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the constant nondimensional Hall diffusion parameter
used to characterise the solutions, the ratio of the nondimensional
ambipolar and Hall diffusion parameters becomes the most important
factor in determining the magnetic behaviour of the similarity
solutions. In truth, the Hall diffusion coefficient could be scaled with
respect to the density and field strength by multiplying the
nondimensional Hall parameter by any function of the similarity variable
@xmath and the fluid variables. This topic is discussed in more detail
in Section 6.3 , where an alternate scaling is proposed for future work
on the self-similar collapse model. The scaling of @xmath given in
Equation 2.103 is appropriate for a molecular cloud core with grains
acting as the dominant positive charge carriers.

For convenience the variable @xmath is used to simplify the equation
set. The similarity variables are then used to rewrite Equations 2.49
and 2.88 – 2.92 in self-similar form:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.104)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.105)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.106)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.107)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.108)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.109)
  -- -------- -- ---------

These equations are augmented by the self-similar definitions

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.110)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.111)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.112)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

while the other field components are given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.113)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.114)
  -- -------- -- ---------

These equations completely describe the collapse of the core into a
pseudodisc and the accretion onto the central point mass (potentially
through a rotationally-supported disc). The equations are the same as
equations 20–32 of Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) , save for the
induction and azimuthal field equations which contain new terms
describing the effect of Hall diffusion. In the ambipolar diffusion
limit, @xmath , Equations 2.104 – 2.114 reduce to those of Krasnopolsky
and Königl ( 2002 ) , allowing direct comparisons to be made between the
similarity solutions from both models.

In order to solve the collapse equations a good understanding of the
asymptotic boundary conditions of the collapse (which take the form of
power law relations in @xmath ) is necessary to ensure that the
solutions match onto observations of collapsing cores and protostellar
discs. While the innermost boundary conditions are derived explicitly in
the following chapter, the outer boundary conditions describing a
supercritical molecular cloud core at the moment of point mass formation
are discussed below.

### 2.7 The Outer Solution

The outer boundary of the self-similar collapse is chosen to match the
density and magnetic profile of a molecular cloud core contracting
quasistatically under ambipolar diffusion until it has just become
supercritical and a point mass forms at the centre (e.g. Shu, 1977 ; Shu
et al., 1987 ) . Such a description is chosen because while the
similarity variable @xmath is undefined at @xmath , @xmath also
corresponds to @xmath and so the initial conditions of the collapse may
also be regarded as the outer boundary conditions of a core that is just
starting to collapse. Such cores are described by the equations for
singular isothermal spheres, which have a density profile @xmath
(Larson, 1969 ; Penston, 1969 ; Shu, 1977 ; Whitworth and Summers, 1985
; McKee and Ostriker, 2007 ) . The surface density is then given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.115)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a constant parameter of the core. This density profile
matches observations of cores (e.g. André et al., 2000 ; Ward-Thompson
et al., 2007 , and the references within) and simulations of cores
produced by turbulent compression (Ballesteros-Paredes et al., 2007 ) or
contracting under ambipolar diffusion (Basu and Mouschovias, 1994 ) .
This is then self-similarised using Equation 2.94 into the outer
boundary condition

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.116)
  -- -------- -- ---------

the value of @xmath is determined from the initial accretion rate of the
core, which is discussed further below.

Magnetically supercritical cores that are contracting slowly have
typical observed radial infall speeds of around @xmath – @xmath km s
@xmath (Lee et al., 2001 ) . The initial state of the model core is
taken to have a spatially-constant radial inflow velocity

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.117)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the constant nondimensional velocity, which has the
self-similar form:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.118)
  -- -------- -- ---------

(using Equation 2.95 ). For an isothermal molecular cloud core at @xmath
K, the sound speed is given by @xmath km s @xmath , so @xmath must be of
order unity to match observed values of core inflow. The similarity
solutions presented in this work use values of @xmath as the outer
boundary condition, which are within the range of values observed in
molecular cloud cores by Lee et al. ( 2001 ) .

Because the infall velocity is constant, so too is the accretion rate,
which is determined by the equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.119)
  -- -------- -- ---------

A constant accretion rate may not be strictly realistic, as accretion
onto stars and cores are thought to be time-variable, however it is
required to preserve the self-similarity of the collapse solutions.
Equation 2.119 may be expressed in self-similar form using Equation 2.97
in the limit of large @xmath to give the dimensionless enclosed mass

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.120)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Equation 2.105 shows that this is equivalent to the boundary condition
in Equation 2.116 ; because they are not unique only one of these
relations may be used to find the similarity solutions. In the numerical
solutions of Ciolek and Königl ( 1998 ) for the collapse of a
nonrotating magnetic core with ambipolar diffusion the mass accretion
rate at point mass formation was found to be @xmath M @xmath Myr @xmath
. This corresponds to a nondimensional parameter @xmath , which is the
value used in the self-similar calculations of Contopoulos et al. ( 1998
) and Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) . A typical accretion rate for
such cores is @xmath , as observations show that @xmath M @xmath Myr
@xmath across many cores (these rates correspond to values of @xmath ;
Lee et al., 2001 ) ; and this value of this parameter is held constant
throughout this work in order to match the solutions of Krasnopolsky and
Königl ( 2002 ) .

In the outermost regions of the core where the density is low the
magnetic field behaviour is described best by ideal MHD; this means that
the mass-to-flux ratio is a constant, given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.121)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a constant parameter of the core. In particular, @xmath
is the dimensionless mass-to-flux ratio in the outer core, and is
defined by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.122)
  -- -------- -- ---------

that is, @xmath is the ratio of the mass-to-flux ratio in the outermost
regions of the core to the critical value for support against gravity
derived in Equation 1.9 (Nakano and Nakamura, 1978 ) . Again, to match
Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) , the value of @xmath is adopted for
all of the similarity solutions in this work; this particular value was
taken from the numerical simulations of Ciolek and Königl ( 1998 ) . It
also matches the observations of Crutcher ( 1999 ) , which showed that
most cores possess mass-to-flux ratios that are more than twice
critical. From Equations 2.116 and 2.120 it is then possible to derive
the magnetic boundary conditions for a supercritical core under ideal
MHD:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.123)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.124)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

again, these are equivalent and only one may be used to calculate the
similarity solutions.

The initial value of the rotational velocity in the outer regions of the
molecular cloud core is also spatially-uniform and given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.125)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which is written in nondimensional form as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.126)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The constant @xmath is the initial dimensionless rotational velocity,
determined by the expression

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.127)
  -- -------- -- ---------

(which was derived using the @xmath dependance of the core surface
density and magnetic field in Basu, 1997 ) . As outlined in Chapter 1 ,
a typical value of the uniform background angular velocity of a
molecular cloud core is @xmath rad s @xmath (Goodman et al., 1993 ; Kane
and Clemens, 1997 , and the other references in Section 1.1 ) and the
background magnetic field may be taken to be @xmath @xmath G (Crutcher,
1999 ) . Substituting these and the values of @xmath and @xmath given
above into Equation 2.127 gives the value of the initial rotational
velocity to be @xmath . This is a factor of 10 larger than that found in
Basu ( 1997 ) , however, the range of observed core velocities is @xmath
, and the dependence of the similarity solutions on the initial core
rotational velocity is explored in Chapter 4 , where it is shown that
the rotational velocity directly influence the size of the inner
Keplerian disc. The Hall similarity solutions presented in Chapter 5
possess a constant value of @xmath for the rotational velocity in order
to facilitate comparison with the fiducial ambipolar diffusion solution
of Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) .

To summarise, the outer boundary conditions of the collapse, which also
serve as initial conditions at point mass formation, are described by
the set of unique self-similar asymptotic equations:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.128)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.129)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.130)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.131)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are the parameters that
describe the outer collapse. In the similarity solutions presented in
this work, these constants take on the values listed in Table 2.1 unless
explicitly stated. These conditions match those of Krasnopolsky and
Königl ( 2002 ) , as neither Hall nor ambipolar diffusion are expected
to be important in the low density outer regions where ideal MHD is
dominant.

The boundary conditions that describe the collapse behaviour in the
innermost regions of self-similar space (corresponding to @xmath or
@xmath ) are less straightforward than those on the outer boundary.
These are influenced by both ambipolar and Hall diffusion, which
determine the surface density and the accretion rate onto the central
mass, and by the strength of the magnetic braking within the core, which
slows the rotation of the gas and may prevent the formation of a
rotationally-supported disc around the protostar. Two sets of inner
boundary conditions satisfy the collapse equations as @xmath : these are
similarity solutions both with and without an inner Keplerian disc. The
derivation of these asymptotic power law solutions, and their individual
applicability and dependence upon the magnetic parameters of the core
are the focus of the following chapter.

## Chapter 3 The Inner Asymptotic Solutions

Whether or not a rotationally-supported disc forms as a result of the
initial collapse of a molecular cloud core is a point of contention in
current simulations of star formation. The previously-accepted model for
innermost regions of the collapsing flow says that the conservation of
angular momentum during collapse results in the progressive increase of
the centrifugal force, which eventually halts the infalling gas and
leads to the development of a central mass surrounded by a flattened
rotationally-supported disc. This has recently been called into question
by both numerical simulations and observations of young stars.

In particular, Mellon and Li ( 2009 ) have shown that no discs could
form around the protostars in their numerical MHD simulations unless the
calculations were started with very dense cores or unreasonably low
ionisation rates. Hennebelle and Ciardi ( 2009 ) and Ciardi and
Hennebelle ( 2010 ) examined the influence of the orientation of the
field with respect to the axis of rotation in the core, and found that
disc formation was suppressed for cores with an initial nondimensional
mass-to-flux ratio of @xmath when the magnetic field and rotational axes
are perpendicular and for @xmath when the field was aligned with the
axis of rotation. However, the observations of Crutcher ( 1999 ) showed
that molecular cloud cores typically possess mass-to-flux ratios that
are @xmath , which would preclude disc formation based upon the results
of Hennebelle and Ciardi ( 2009 ) . Price and Bate ( 2007 ) compared
hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical simulations and found that
protostar formation was delayed in calculations with a magnetic field;
they also found that magnetic pressure support causes the suppression of
fragmentation within a forming disc. These results present a complicated
picture in which Keplerian disc formation is not a certain consequence
of the star formation process.

Observations have also cast doubt on the star-and-disc formation model.
Stassun et al. ( 2001 , following up on the observations of () ) found
in their observations a population of fifteen slowly-rotating ( @xmath
days) pre-main-sequence stars that show no evidence of circumstellar
discs. This result was unexpected, as it had previously been believed
that such slowing of the angular momentum of young stars could only
occur so early in the collapse process through interactions between the
protostar and a protostellar disc (e.g. Königl, 1991 ; Ghosh and Lamb,
1979a , b ) .

The semianalytic solutions of Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 , as well
as the similarity solutions presented in Chapter 5 ) demonstrated disc
formation for cores with @xmath , however they were also able to show
that no disc would form if the magnetic braking is particularly strong
or the initial cloud rotation rate too slow. Shu et al. ( 2006 )
describe the problem of forming discs as a further manifestation of the
magnetic flux problem outlined in Chapter 1 (while others and this work
refer to it as the magnetic braking catastrophe); they also showed that
the addition of non-ideal MHD processes make it possible to dissipate
the flux and form a thin disc (in their particular calculations with
numerical reconnection they chose to include Ohmic resistivity).

For the self-similar collapse equations developed in the preceding
chapter there are two distinct power law similarity solutions for the
innermost region: one in which a rotationally-supported disc forms and
the fluid accretes slowly onto the central object, and a second in which
the material supersonically falls onto the central protostar in a
magnetically-diluted free fall. This chapter presents these similarity
solutions, the dominant physics in each and the initial conditions in
the molecular cloud core that determine whether or not a disc may form
during collapse. The implications of these solutions on the dichotomy of
results that form the magnetic braking catastrophe are also discussed.

### 3.1 Derivation

In the innermost regions of the gravitational collapse of a molecular
cloud core, the self-similar collapse equations derived in Chapter 2 are
satisfied by similarity solutions in which the variables take the form
of power laws with respect to the similarity variable, @xmath . These
solutions are found by taking the limit of the equations as @xmath ;
this limit can also be thought of as either of the dimensional limits
@xmath or @xmath , which are the innermost region and the late stages of
collapse respectively.

The similarity solutions to the full collapse process that are presented
in Chapters 4 and 5 tend asymptotically towards these power law
solutions which are then imposed as boundary conditions on the inner
boundary of the collapse calculations. While there may be other
mathematically valid similarity solutions to the disc equations in the
central regions of the collapse, these are unphysical (typically with
negative values of the scale height or surface density) and therefore
are not within the scope of this work.

The two similarity solutions presented here are found by assuming that
the collapse variables take the form of a set of power law relations
defined by

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.1)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.2)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.3)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where the exponents @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are real numbers, and the
coefficients @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are constants that are found by
solving the collapse equations once the exponents have been derived. The
other variables are calculated by substituting these equations into the
MHD equations and taking the limit as @xmath to find and equate the
dominant terms.

As the differential equation for @xmath depends only on @xmath and
@xmath , Equation 3.1 can be substituted into Equation 2.105 and
integrated to give

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

This equation cannot be simplified further until the value of @xmath is
known, or until limits are placed upon @xmath such that one term or the
other is dominant. Clearly, the term with the lower exponent of @xmath
will be larger when @xmath , so that for the case when @xmath , @xmath ,
so that the enclosed mass @xmath ; and conversely when @xmath , @xmath
as @xmath .

Similarly, the differential equation for the enclosed flux depends only
on @xmath and @xmath , so that Equation 2.104 , when integrated, becomes

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

The vertical magnetic field is expected to scale with @xmath in the same
manner as the magnetic dominant field component, if it is not itself the
dominant component. When @xmath then @xmath and @xmath scales as @xmath
, so that it becomes the dominant scaling term in the magnetic field. In
order to maintain the dominance of @xmath , the central flux is set to
@xmath . This is supported in the literature, as Krasnopolsky and Königl
( 2002 ) also drop this term in their description of the inner disc.

Having accepted this rationale for the behaviour of the flux, the radial
field component is then defined by the monopole approximation (Equation
2.112 ) as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

which clearly scales with the vertical field component.

The exact scaling of the azimuthal field component cannot be so easily
determined, due to the artificial cap that keeps @xmath . This cap
implies that @xmath can be regarded as scaling with @xmath as a first
approximation, especially as @xmath typically appears in the disc
equations summed with another component of the magnetic field, with the
precise value of @xmath to be determined once the other scalings are
known.

The scale height is written as the solution to the quadratic equation
for the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium ( 2.108 ):

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.8)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.9)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Applying Equations 3.1 – 3.6 to @xmath and @xmath , these terms become

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (3.10)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.11)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

so that for any combination of @xmath and @xmath the behaviour of @xmath
can be determined. There are two terms that can be dominant for each of
@xmath and @xmath , and each applies when the following conditions on
@xmath and @xmath are satisfied:

  -- -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
        @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.12)
        @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.13)
        @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.14)
        @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.15)
  -- -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The different regions of @xmath -space that are delineated by these
inequalities are shown in Figure 3.1 , where the combinations of A/B and
C/D describe particular regions of behaviour for @xmath .

The scaling of @xmath , with respect to @xmath and @xmath , can have one
of two different values, depending upon the scalings of the terms within
the square root in Equation 3.7 ; clearly the larger of @xmath and
@xmath will dominate and determine the behaviour of @xmath . Again,
there are two possible cases:

  -- -- -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
           @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.16)
           @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.17)
  -- -- -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Case a, regardless of the region of @xmath -space in which it is
calculated, represents the trivial solution of @xmath and will not be
examined further in this work, as any solution that satisfies this
condition, while mathematically valid, would represent a state that is
intrinsically unphysical. Case b, and the boundary case where @xmath
scales as @xmath , must be examined in each of the four regions of the
@xmath -plane in order to determine all of the possible similarity
solutions of interest for the innermost regions of the gravitational
collapse.

This exploration of @xmath -space, and the derivation of the two
physical similarity solutions to the fluid equations, is presented in
Appendix A for the interested reader who wishes to study the solutions
in more depth. The first of these is a slowly-accreting Keplerian disc,
which is discussed in the following section, while the second is a
magnetically-diluted free fall flow onto the central protostar, which is
discussed in detail in Section 3.3 .

### 3.2 Keplerian Disc Solution

The first solution (derived in Section A.2 and belonging to the region
AC of the @xmath -plane) is a Keplerian disc, where the material is
supported against gravity by its angular momentum, and only slowly
accretes onto the central mass. The scale height of the disc and the
surface density are both dependent upon the Hall and ambipolar diffusion
coefficients, represented here by the nondimensional constants @xmath
and @xmath .

The similarity solution in nondimensional form is given by the set of
relations:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.18)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.19)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.20)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.21)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.22)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.23)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.24)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.25)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.26)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.27)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.28)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

the constant @xmath is the nondimensional infall rate onto the central
star and @xmath is the constant parameterising the artificial cap placed
upon @xmath to prevent it from becoming the dominant field component in
the innermost regions of the disc. The coefficients @xmath and @xmath
are constants, determined by the expressions

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a function of the magnetic diffusion parameters, given
by the equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

Rather than continuing to study this solution in the nondimensional
form, it is more illuminating to convert these power law relations to
dimensional form using Equations 2.94 – 2.99 , so that the Keplerian
disc variables are

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.32)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.33)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.34)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.35)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.36)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.37)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.38)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.39)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.40)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.41)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.42)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

the coefficients @xmath and @xmath remain those in Equations 3.29 – 3.31
, @xmath is the isothermal sound speed and @xmath is the gravitational
constant. The disc matter is in Keplerian orbit, with @xmath given by
the canonical value ( @xmath ; Newton, 1760 ) . The radial scaling of
the surface density ( @xmath ) is that expected from the minimum mass
solar nebula (Weidenschilling, 1977 ) and other simulations of
protostellar discs (e.g. Cameron and Pine, 1973 ) ; and the magnetic
field scaling also matches that from theory, particularly of discs that
support disc winds ( @xmath ; Blandford and Payne, 1982 ) . It is
interesting to note that the coefficient of the vertical magnetic field,
@xmath , does not depend upon the magnetic diffusion parameters, but
rather the nondimensional mass infall rate and the cap placed upon
@xmath .

The azimuthal magnetic field component blows up with respect to the
other field components in this small @xmath limit because the azimuthal
magnetic field drift speed is slow compared with the Keplerian speed.
The model adopted for the vertical angular momentum transport is unable
to properly account for the effects of magnetic braking in the small
@xmath limit, so @xmath takes on the value of the cap placed upon it. If
a different scaling for @xmath were adopted then Hall diffusion could
act to limit @xmath in such a way that the cap becomes unnecessary;
however, within the context of this disc solution other scalings of
@xmath lead either to a breakdown of self-similarity, or to a solution
in which the diffusion is so strong that the fluid falls rapidly onto
the protostar and no rotationally-supported disc may form, in a similar
manner to the second similarity solution presented in Section 3.3 .

These power laws are the solutions to the following simplified
equations:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.43)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.44)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.45)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.46)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.47)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.48)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.49)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.50)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.51)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

The induction equation ( 3.45 ) can be written quite simply as @xmath ,
that is, the inward radial velocity of the fluid is balanced by the
drift of the magnetic field with respect to the gas. Any accretion
through the centrifugally-supported disc is regulated by the outward
diffusion of the magnetic field against the flow.

The size of the magnetic diffusion parameters determine the build up of
fluid relative to the magnetic field in the disc, and the sign of the
Hall diffusion term places limits on its size. Should the Hall parameter
become too large, and possess the wrong sign, relative to the other
diffusion term, then @xmath becomes negative and the surface density
with it, which is clearly unphysical. In order to ensure that the
induction equation is satisfied and a rotationally-supported disc forms,
the diffusion parameters must satisfy the inequality @xmath , which
becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

for the typical value of @xmath . The forbidden region of parameter
space in which no disc may form is the shaded area in Figure 3.2 , with
the solid boundary line corresponding to @xmath .

As is clear from Figure 3.2 , there can be no solution for the core with
purely Hall diffusion where the Hall diffusion parameter is positive, as
the positive Hall parameter acts to restrain the effects of ambipolar
and Ohmic diffusion. However, when the Hall diffusion parameter is
negative (corresponding to a reversal of the magnetic field) it acts in
the same radial direction as the ambipolar diffusion term, enhancing the
diffusion of the magnetic field through the disc. In the case of pure
ambipolar diffusion the field moves inward slower than the neutral
particles and the solution reduces to that depicted in the inner
asymptotic region of the fiducial solution of Krasnopolsky and Königl (
2002 , equations 51–57) .

The plot in Figure 3.2 shows the two-dimensional area of magnetic
diffusion parameter space that gives feasible values of the surface
density @xmath at @xmath AU when @xmath years, @xmath km s @xmath and
@xmath for solutions with an accretion rate of @xmath M @xmath yr @xmath
(which corresponds to @xmath G). The dotted line represents a surface
density at 1 AU of @xmath g/cm @xmath , which is the value from the
minimum mass solar nebula model (Weidenschilling, 1977 ) in which the
surface density of the solar nebula is estimated by adding sufficient
hydrogen and helium to the solid bodies in the solar system to recover
standard interstellar abundances, and spreading this material smoothly
into a disc. The dashed lines in Figure 3.2 correspond to higher surface
densities that are more like those realistically expected to occur in
protostellar discs.

As @xmath decreases in comparison to a constant @xmath the surface
density becomes large due to the changed amount of field line drift as
the radial field diffusion slows the rate of infall. The ambipolar
diffusion-only fiducial solution of Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) ,
which shall be discussed in detail in Section 4.3 , has an accretion
rate of @xmath M @xmath yr @xmath , and the surface density at 1 AU in
their solution is @xmath g/cm @xmath . Adding a positive value of @xmath
to this similarity solution causes the surface density to decrease,
which is problematic if one expects to form large planets from their
disc, however, if the Hall parameter is negative then its presence
raises the surface density to something more realistic.

As an experiment, the equations are solved to obtain a set of variables
that are functions of @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and the core parameters
to get the relationships modelled in Figure 3.3 . These functions are
outlined below:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.53)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.54)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.55)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.56)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.57)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.58)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.59)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

the other field components were defined as being of order @xmath in
Equations 3.49 – 3.51 . This model emphasizes the build up of the
central mass through accretion, and Figure 3.3 shows the effect of Hall
diffusion and the magnetic field strength on the surface density at
@xmath AU for a system with @xmath .

Alternatively, the disc variables can be thought of as functions of
@xmath and @xmath , treating @xmath as the ratio between @xmath and
@xmath rather than the actual age of the system. This makes it possible
to regard the system as a steady state disc, where the other variables
are defined by

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.60)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.61)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.62)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.63)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

@xmath and @xmath are unchanged from Equations 3.55 and 3.56 , as are
the field components from Equation 3.49 – 3.51 . The relationship
between @xmath and @xmath is shown on the horizontal axes of Figure 3.3
.

Figure 3.3 shows the influence of Hall diffusion on the surface density,
plotted against @xmath and @xmath for constant @xmath . When the Hall
diffusion term is negative, the surface density increases, creating a
larger and heavier disc, while a positive Hall term, corresponding to a
reversal of the field with respect to the axis of rotation, causes a
decrease in @xmath which drops off dramatically as the Hall term
approaches the lower limit implied by the inequality @xmath .

The Keplerian disc solution says nothing about the angular momentum
problem of star formation described in Section 1.4 , as the accretion
through the disc is slow and the model for the angular momentum
transport by magnetic braking is oversimplified by the cap that is
placed on the azimuthal field component. Magnetic diffusion is key to
the magnetic flux problem outlined in Section 1.5 and the addition of
Hall diffusion to the self-similar collapse model has been shown to
assist in solving this, or to complicate it further, depending upon the
orientation of the field.

### 3.3 Free Fall Solution

The second similarity solution, derived in Section A.2 and located in
the blue lower left region AD of the @xmath -plane (Figure 3.1 ),
describes the behaviour of the infall when the magnetic braking is very
efficient at removing angular momentum from the flow. In this case there
is very little angular momentum remaining and the reduced centrifugal
support inhibits disc formation, so that the collapsing flow becomes a
supersonic magnetically-diluted free fall onto the central protostellar
mass. This solution is representative of the magnetic braking
catastrophe that affects many numerical simulations of gravitational
collapse.

The nondimensional form of this similarity solution is given by the
complete set of fluid variables:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.64)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.65)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.66)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.67)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.68)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.69)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.70)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.71)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.72)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.73)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

In the limit where there is only ambipolar diffusion, this similarity
solution reduces to the asymptotic inner solution to the “strong
braking” collapse, which was presented without explicit derivation by
Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 , equations 66–71) . In their solutions
the angular momentum and the azimuthal field component are reduced to a
small plateau value as the strong magnetic braking has removed almost
all of the angular momentum early in the collapse (see Figure 6.4 and
Section 6.2 , where this is discussed in more detail). Their similarity
solutions tended towards this behaviour when the magnetic braking
parameter, @xmath , was large, even though it does not appear in
Equations 3.64 – 3.73 .

Given that there are two possible values for @xmath , depending upon the
chosen values of the parameters @xmath and @xmath , there are two
possible sets of coefficients for @xmath and @xmath . These are derived
in Section A.3 in region AD of the @xmath -plane (see Figure 3.1 ), and
are referenced by the subscripts 1 and 2 depending on which term in
Equation 3.73 is the minimum that defines @xmath .

The first set of coefficients occur when

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.74)
  -- -------- -- --------

corresponding to the left hand side of the minimum choice for @xmath in
Equation 3.73 . The coefficient @xmath is then the single real root of
the polynomial

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.75)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a constant defined by the magnetic diffusion parameters:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.76)
  -- -------- -- --------

The coefficients for @xmath and @xmath are given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.77)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.78)
  -- -------- -- --------

This solution is the asymptotic inner solution of Krasnopolsky and
Königl ( 2002 ) for their strong braking similarity solutions. In their
solution, @xmath , @xmath , and the angular momentum coefficient @xmath
, so the angular momentum tends towards zero as @xmath .

The second set of coefficients are adopted when the inequality

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.79)
  -- -------- -- --------

is satisfied, so that @xmath takes on the second value in 3.73 , @xmath
. The coefficient @xmath is given by the single positive real root of
the equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.80)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.81)
  -- -------- -- --------

This then gives the other coefficients as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.82)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.83)
  -- -------- -- --------

This solution was not explored in Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) , as
without the Hall term the left hand side of the minimum condition in
Equation 3.73 is always zero and can never exceed the right hand side.

As in the Keplerian disc solution, this similarity solution can be
converted to dimensional form using Equations 2.94 – 2.99 , to better
understand the physics behind the free fall collapse. In this case the
solution becomes:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.84)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.85)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.86)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.87)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.88)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.89)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.90)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.91)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.92)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.93)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.94)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

By taking the absolute value of @xmath the sign of @xmath is held
constant. Were the sign of @xmath to change, then the signs of @xmath
and @xmath would also change, resulting in a set of flow variables that
are identical but for a reversed direction of @xmath . The absolute
value of the Hall diffusion coefficient is adopted merely to simplify
the calculations.

The power laws are solutions to the simplified equations:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.95)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.96)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.97)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.98)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.99)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.100)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.101)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.102)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.103)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

as in the Keplerian disc solution the induction equation takes the
simplified form @xmath . In this similarity solution any remaining
rotation of the flow is that induced by the magnetic “braking”, which
can cause rotation by Hall diffusion in the azimuthal direction of the
field lines tied to the electrons, which creates a rotational torque on
the neutrals and grains as they fall inward rapidly.

Equations 3.95 – 3.100 may be solved to give the disc variables as
functions of the surface density and magnetic field:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.104)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.105)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.106)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.107)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

where the field components are given by Equations 3.101 – 3.103 and the
scale height of the disc is given by the equation

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.108)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.109)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

depending on which value of the azimuthal field component is adopted.

This similarity solution is an example of the magnetic braking
catastrophe that occurs in numerical simulations of star formation when
the magnetic braking of a collapsing core is so strong that all angular
momentum is removed from the gas and it is impossible to form a
rotationally-supported disc (e.g. Mellon and Li, 2008 , 2009 ) . It is
clear from Equations 3.69 , 3.73 and 3.77 that when there is no Hall
diffusion the magnetic braking in this solution causes @xmath , which is
indicative of the catastrophe and prevents disc formation. This
behaviour was demonstrated in the “strong braking” solution of
Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) where @xmath and the fluid was able to
fall onto the protostar with very little angular momentum remaining.
This particular solution, and the magnetic braking catastrophe more
generally, are discussed in more detail in Section 6.2 .

The introduction of Hall diffusion to the similarity solution can cause
additional twisting of the field lines and magnetic braking, or it can
cause a reduction in these by twisting the magnetic field lines in the
opposite direction, in effect spinning up the collapse. The direction of
the Hall diffusion depends upon the orientation of the field with
respect to the axis of rotation, and it is obvious that this
directionality has an important effect on the magnetic braking
catastrophe. The linear scaling of the angular momentum with radius
(Equation 3.90 ) suggests that the point mass at the origin has no
angular momentum, however, Hall diffusion will likely ensure that in the
innermost regions of the collapse the angular momentum shall reach a
plateau value similar to that in Figure 6.4 for the ambipolar
diffusion-only collapse. No similarity solutions to the full collapse
problem were found that matched onto the free fall inner asymptotic
solution discussed in this section, however, work is underway to find
similarity solutions with strong @xmath and @xmath that demonstrate this
asymptotic behaviour and illustrate how the Hall effect influences the
magnetic braking catastrophe directly.

### 3.4 Summary

This chapter saw the derivation of two distinct power law similarity
solutions to the fluid equations in the innermost regions of the
collapse as @xmath . The first of these was a rotationally-supported
disc through which the gas is slowly accreted. The surface density and
scale height of the disc are determined by the magnetic diffusion
coefficients, with Hall diffusion either adding to or reducing the
surface density. The magnetic field and surface density scale with
radius in the same way as in previous protostellar disc models and any
accretion through the disc is regulated by the outward diffusion of the
magnetic field against the flow.

The diffusion coefficients also placed limits upon the flow. In order to
form a Keplerian disc as described by the first asymptotic solution,
certain restrictions are placed upon the diffusion coefficients. Hall
diffusion can counteract the ambipolar diffusion and prevent the gas
from falling in; a disc may only form when the nondimensional Hall
parameter @xmath is no larger than @xmath (for @xmath ). There is no
lower limit on the size of the Hall diffusion parameter, as when @xmath
is negative it aids the outward diffusion of the field, reducing the
amount of magnetic flux that is accreted onto the central protostar. The
orientation of the field with respect to the axis of rotation determines
the direction of the Hall diffusion and whether it resolves or furthers
the magnetic flux problem outlined in Section 1.5 .

Similarly, the Hall effect can increase or reduce the angular momentum
problem in the second asymptotic solution, where the matter is free
falling onto the central protostar and the only rotational velocity is
that induced by Hall diffusion in the azimuthal direction. No disc may
form in this solution, as the strong magnetic braking prevents the
centrifugal force from becoming large enough to support the infalling
gas against gravity. The amount of magnetic braking affecting the flow
depends upon the Hall parameter as well as the values of the magnetic
braking parameter, @xmath (Equation 2.84 ), and the cap on @xmath ,
@xmath (see Equation 2.114 ). This is expected to be the asymptotic
inner solution for the collapse when the parameters @xmath and @xmath
are large, as in the “strong braking” similarity solution of
Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) , which is discussed further in Section
6.2 .

The two similarity solutions represent both sides of the disc formation
problem that is referred to in the literature as the magnetic braking
catastrophe. In the first, the magnetic braking is limited, and a
rotationally-supported disc such as those in the simulations of Machida
et al. ( 2011 ) forms, while in the second no disc forms as the
catastrophic magnetic braking removes almost all of the angular momentum
so that the matter is falling rapidly onto the central protostar as in
the simulations of Mellon and Li ( 2009 ) and others. This problem has
yet to be fully resolved, however the magnetic diffusion is clearly
important in determining whether or not a disc forms and which of the
two asymptotic solutions shall describe the inner region of any given
collapsing molecular cloud core.

All of the similarity solutions presented in Chapters 4 and 5 form
rotationally-supported discs, and those with Hall and ambipolar
diffusion match specifically onto the Keplerian disc solution described
here. The asymptotic similarity solution is used as the inner boundary
condition for these models, enforcing disc formation to show how the
Hall effect influences the properties of disc-forming similarity
solutions. The free fall solution is not studied further as part of the
full collapse models, but it shall be discussed in Section 6.2 and it is
expected that similarity solutions matching onto this asymptotic
solution will be found in future.

## Chapter 4 Collapse without the Hall Effect

The construction of the self-similar model for studying gravitational
collapse with the Hall effect was a gradual affair, taking place in
stages of increasing physical complexity. The reasons for this were
twofold: firstly, a good initial guess of the variables was required in
order to solve the equations with Hall diffusion — the calculation of
similarity solutions without Hall diffusion would provide this guess.
Secondly, by reproducing the results of previous self-similar collapse
models it is possible to check the calculation code to ensure that it is
both numerically robust and physically sound, and to be certain that the
changes brought on by the introduction of Hall diffusion are properly
contrasted with similarity solutions that contain less complex physics.
The three models calculated in this chapter belong to different families
of similarity solutions: those that are nonmagnetic, those with ideal
magnetohydrodynamics, and those with non-ideal MHD and ambipolar
diffusion.

This chapter is dedicated to outlining the construction, testing and
physical behaviour of these models, and the derivation of the necessary
inner asymptotic solutions and jump conditions that determine the
collapse behaviour as @xmath . These are then compared to models found
in the literature, adopting their boundary conditions and reproduce
their results. As may be expected, the primary targets of these
comparisons are the results of Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) ,
although the work of Saigo and Hanawa ( 1998 ) shall also be discussed.
The similarity solutions presented in this chapter provide a baseline
for the discussion of the physics affecting the solutions presented in
Chapter 5 once the Hall term is activated.

All of the similarity solutions presented in this chapter include the
effects of rotation, and all of them form rotationally-supported discs.
Although it was shown by Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) that there
exist similarity solutions for which the magnetic braking is so strong
that no disc forms (the free fall asymptotic solution presented in
Section 3.3 demonstrates the inner boundary conditions for such a
solution in the Hall regime), those solutions are not reproduced in this
work. This modified angular momentum problem, in which the magnetic
braking is so strong that it removes all of the angular momentum from
the collapsing flow has been seen in many numerical simulations (e.g.
Mellon and Li, 2008 , 2009 ; Hennebelle and Ciardi, 2009 ) , and has yet
to be fully resolved. The inclusion of Ohmic diffusion (Dapp and Basu,
2010 ) and Hall diffusion (Krasnopolsky et al., 2011 ) has been shown to
reduce the magnetic braking catastrophe, which is discussed further in
Section 6.2 .

Discs form in the collapse solutions presented in this chapter because
the magnetic braking is artificially capped in a manner that could be a
reasonable substitute for nonaxisymmetric effects, or a disc wind, that
could change the transport of angular momentum above the pseudodisc. By
studying those solutions with discs the importance of the magnetic field
diffusion in driving and controlling gravitational collapse will be
demonstrated.

This chapter outlines the construction and results of collapse models
that are nonmagnetic (Section 4.1 ), that are magnetic under ideal MHD
(Section 4.2 ), and that are magnetic with ambipolar diffusion in
Section 4.3 . For each of these collapse simulations the inner
asymptotic solution must be derived, as well as the jump conditions at
the centrifugal shock and an estimation of the shock position. The
calculation procedure is then described and the results of each model
examined. The impact of rotation and magnetic fields on the structural
features of the similarity solutions, particularly the centrifugal shock
and the size of the rotationally-supported disc, are analysed with
reference to previous models of collapse in order to provide a solid
foundation for discussing the influence of the Hall effect on the
solutions in the following chapter.

### 4.1 Nonmagnetic Solutions

The simplest model constructed here is that of a nonmagnetic rotating
collapse, which has been examined by Saigo and Hanawa ( 1998 ) and
Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) . This model is characterised by the
equations

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.1)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.2)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.3)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.4)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

which are the nonmagnetic form of Equations 2.88 – 2.91 . Because there
is no mechanism for braking the angular momentum, no central mass forms
and the only term left to control the vertical squeezing of the
pseudodisc is its self-gravity.

The nondimensional form of Equations 4.1 , 4.2 and 4.4 is

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.5)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.6)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.7)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

while the simplified self-similar angular momentum equation,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

is integrated to give

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a constant. Its value is the initial ( @xmath ) ratio of
the angular momentum to the mass at the outer boundary, given by the
expression

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the constants @xmath and @xmath characterise the outer boundary
conditions @xmath and @xmath (see Section 2.7 ). This ratio @xmath is
denoted @xmath by Saigo and Hanawa ( 1998 ) ; their outer boundary
conditions are described by the same equations as in this work, however
the values of the parameters characterising any given similarity
solution are subtly different from those chosen in this work. Their
@xmath solution corresponds quite well to the fast rotation solution
presented in subsection 4.1.3 .

Equation 4.9 , which takes the dimensional form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

holds true in the outer (large @xmath ) regions of all of the solutions
presented in this thesis, although it breaks down in the magnetic
solutions at lower @xmath as the flux builds up and magnetic braking
starts to reduce the angular momentum. Matsumoto et al. ( 1997 ) showed
that Equation 4.11 held true across many orders of magnitude in their
nonmagnetic two-dimensional numerical solutions of the collapse of a
rotating cloud into a rotating disc. Clearly this relation holds when
the rotational velocity and the density are uniform, and if the initial
cloud has constant density and rotational velocity before it is
centrally condensed Equation 4.11 will hold true for the nonmagnetic
collapse so long as the collapse is axisymmetric.

From Equations 4.5 – 4.10 it is possible to derive the asymptotic
similarity solution describing the behaviour of the flow inwards of the
centrifugal shock, the jump conditions and the position of the shock
itself.

#### 4.1.1 Inner solution

As in Chapter 3 for the full model with Hall diffusion, the inner
asymptotic solution is found by assuming that the surface density takes
the form of a power law in @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are both real constants. The conservation of
mass equation ( 4.5 ),

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

is integrated to give

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

The requirement that the rotational velocity must not diverge as @xmath
means that the angular momentum must vanish at the origin, and that no
central point mass can form. Using Equation 4.9 the angular momentum of
the fluid is then given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

Equations 4.12 , 4.14 and 4.15 are then substituted into the
conservation of radial momentum equation ( 4.6 ), so that it is then
expressed in terms of @xmath and the constants,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

Taking the limit as @xmath , the @xmath terms are clearly much smaller
than those terms of @xmath , and so they may be dropped from the
equation. This then becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

and when each pair of exponents are equated it becomes obvious that the
only solution is @xmath . Substituting this into Equation 4.17 reduces
it to a quadratic in @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

The inner asymptotic solution is thus defined by the equations:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.19)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.20)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.21)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.22)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.23)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.24)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.25)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

These equations are identical to the inner solution that was presented
without explicit derivation in §3.1 of Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 )
. This inner solution ceases to exist when @xmath , as in this regime
@xmath becomes complex; and a second unstable solution exists when the
coefficient of @xmath is the second root of Equation 4.18 . Any increase
in @xmath corresponds to a reduction in the gravitational force, so that
it is no longer able to balance the centrifugal and pressure forces in
the disc. If the initial ratio of the centrifugal to gravitational
forces is too high then no disc can form, as there is no mechanism for
reducing the centrifugal forces to create a stable disc.

In order to better understand the behaviour of this disc, it is
worthwhile to convert the asymptotic similarity solution back to
dimensional form:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.26)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.27)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.28)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.29)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.30)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.31)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.32)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

where the constant @xmath retains its definition from Equation 4.19 . At
any given radius the enclosed mass and surface density are constant with
time, and the material orbits with a stable rotational velocity. These
relations may also be written as a set of variables that are functions
of @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.33)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.34)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.35)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.36)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

These are all steady state equations, as the material joining the disc
quickly loses its radial momentum and stops moving inward. The gas is
unable to move inwards after this point as there is no way to change its
angular momentum, and so the material remains in orbit, unable to fall
to the origin to form a point mass.

These inner asymptotic solutions match quite well onto the inner regions
of the similarity solutions close to the origin. The outer edge of this
region is marked by a steep shock, which separates the inner
centrifugally-supported disc from the outer dynamic collapse. The
properties of this shock are outlined in the following subsection.

#### 4.1.2 Shock position and jump conditions

The transition between the outer supersonic collapse and the inner
steady state disc takes the form of an abrupt change in both the surface
density @xmath and the radial velocity @xmath . Inward of this shock,
the density increases dramatically, and the infall velocity is slowed to
a very low value, which rapidly drops to zero in the post-shock region.
In solutions where the matter is initially rapidly rotating, the radial
velocity can change sign as the shock front overtakes it, creating a
region of shocked backflow that follows behind the shock front until the
radial velocity decreases enough that the gas settles into the
asymptotic steady state disc.

Although the form of the inner asymptotic solution changes with the
addition of magnetic fields and then magnetic diffusion, this shock is a
common feature of all the similarity solutions presented in this work.
Its position is estimated to occur at the centrifugal radius , the point
where gravity and the centrifugal forces are first in approximate
balance (which is near to the boundary of the rotationally-supported
disc), and this radius will be shown to be a reasonable approximation to
the shock position. It is calculated by equating the gravitational and
centrifugal forces in the radial momentum equation ( 4.6 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

and then solving for the centrifugal radius, @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

This calculation requires a deep understanding of the behaviour of both
the enclosed mass and the angular momentum in the region of the shock;
these become more difficult to estimate with the increasing complexity
of the models. However, in the nonmagnetic case this is clearly given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

where an approximation to the mass is still needed in order to determine
the centrifugal radius.

The initial (outer) conditions have the gas infalling at a velocity
@xmath , however, as the mass of the inner disc grows more matter is
pulled inwards faster, so that in the slower rotation cases, the gas
close to the centrifugal shock is falling in at free fall speeds. When
the radial velocity becomes much larger than @xmath , then @xmath and
@xmath , and the continuity equation becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

(using @xmath ); this causes the value of the enclosed mass to drop to a
plateau value that remains near-constant until the centrifugal shock
position (as can be seen in the results in the following subsection).
The outer edge of this plateau is estimated to occur at

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is something of an overestimate as @xmath is typically larger than
@xmath when @xmath reaches the plateau value. At this point the outer
asymptotic solution is still a good approximation to @xmath , and so it
and Equation 4.41 are substituted into @xmath to give an approximation
to the plateau mass:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

The value of the mass in the plateau changes very little between @xmath
and @xmath , and so this calculated value can be substituted into
Equation 4.39 to give the approximate centrifugal shock position,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

This equation (derived in equations 34–35 of Krasnopolsky and Königl,
2002 ) only applies if @xmath , which is true whenever @xmath . Given
the limit on @xmath established in 4.1.1 , this weak inequality is not
violated in the similarity solutions explored in this thesis. There is
no solution if the mass has yet to reach its plateau value.

For the models presented in the next subsection, the actual centrifugal
shock position is close to the one calculated by Equation 4.43 , and the
values of these are presented for comparison in Table 4.1 . As they are
so close, Equation 4.43 is an acceptable initial guess to use when
finding the shock position by the iterative process described in Section
5.2.2 for the Hall similarity solutions. While this process is used with
few modifications in all of the models presented in this work, its
description is left to the following chapter for the reader interested
only in the model with Hall diffusion.

Because the centrifugal shock manifests as a discontinuity in @xmath and
@xmath , the jump conditions must be calculated explicitly at the shock
position. At the shock, the radial momentum equation ( 4.6 ) can be
written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the terms on the right hand side of Equation 4.6 are all small at
the shock in comparison to the steep derivative term on the left. The
shock occurs because of the singularity inherent to the equation, which
occurs at the locus of points where @xmath , that is, where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

In dimensional form the singularity takes the form of the sonic line,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

The shock occurs when the curve describing the flow crosses the singular
line in the @xmath -plane. The shock propagates outwards at the speed of
sound, and occurs near the centrifugal radius defined above.

The jump conditions are found by solving the continuity and radial
momentum equations at the position of the shock. At the shock, the
derivatives of @xmath and @xmath become large with respect to the other
terms in the equations, which may then be disregarded. The equations are
then integrated at @xmath to define the jump conditions.

Starting by examining the conservation of mass across the shock, @xmath
is substituted into Equation 4.5 to give

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

which can be simplified to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

As mentioned above, the terms on the right hand side of this equation
are small compared to the large derivatives on the left, and so they are
dropped. The derivative is then integrated across the shock front to
give the first of the jump conditions:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

which ensures that the mass is conserved across the shock.

Similarly, the terms on the right hand side of the radial momentum
equation can be dropped, and it is then rearranged into the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

This term is integrated across the shock front to become

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

taking advantage of Equation 4.49 , a factor of @xmath can be removed
from the integral in 4.51 :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the fully integrated radial momentum equation is rearranged into the
form of the second jump condition:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

The jump conditions presented in Equations 4.49 and 4.53 are solved
simultaneously by denoting the upstream and downstream sides of the
shock by the subscripts @xmath and @xmath and rewriting them in the form

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.54)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.55)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

The first of these is substituted into the second, and this is
factorised to give the equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

which has the non-trivial solution:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.57)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.58)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

These jump conditions, presented with minimal derivation in appendix B1
of Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) , are applicable to all of the
collapse calculations in which there is no mechanism by which the
magnetic field can be changed by the passage of the shock front. Even in
those solutions with magnetic diffusion, the magnetic pressure and
tension terms are never large enough to influence the behaviour of the
field in the centrifugal shock; the magnetic field is not affected
directly by the shock, although the field behaviour quickly changes in
the post-shock region, and so these jump conditions are used in those
solutions.

The only similarity solutions with different jump conditions are those
for ideal MHD; these conditions are derived in subsection 4.2.2 .
Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) also derived jump conditions for a
shock in which the scale height @xmath was unaffected by the change in
the density at the shock because the thickness of the disc is determined
by the gravity of the central point mass. These jump conditions are not
required here, as the similarity solutions studied in this text occur in
regions of parameter space where the gravity of the central mass does
not yet control the vertical squeezing of the collapsing flow in the
area of the centrifugal shock.

The jump conditions in Equations 4.57 and 4.58 make it possible to
calculate the similarity solutions to the nonmagnetic rotational
collapse equations.

#### 4.1.3 Similarity solutions

The similarity solutions are found by integrating the fluid equations
from the outer boundary to the inner one using the stifbs integrator
routine for integrating stiff sets of equations from Numerical Recipes
in Fortran 77 (Press et al., 1992 ) , and checked against the output
from the fifth order Runge–Kutter integrator rkqs from the same source.
Stiff equations are those for which the normal numerical methods used to
integrate them are numerically unstable unless the step size is very
small; the fluid equations describing gravitational collapse are often
stiff, particularly in the innermost regions of the collapse. These
routines (and their dependencies) were modified from their original form
to use double precision floating point variables, and produce output
that in general is identical to the seventh significant figure. While
either routine may be used to calculate this model, the more complicated
models following on from this are sometimes unable to be completed using
the stifbs routine as it uses a finite differences method for
calculating the Jacobian of the derivatives which operates poorly in
those regions near to the shocks (it was too complicated to derive a set
of analytic expressions for the Jacobian for the later collapse models).
In those instances the rkqs routine is used; this change is not expected
to introduce significant errors.

As the code integrates the variables inwards from the outer boundary
towards the inner boundary, the jump conditions derived in the previous
subsection are applied at the approximate position of the shock. The
behaviour of the variables inwards of the shock allows for a better
estimate of the shock position to be determined, and by a process of
iteration the true value of the shock is found. This routine is
described in full in Section 5.2 for the collapse with Hall diffusion;
qualitatively, the same downstream behaviour is observed in each of the
earlier collapse models. If the jump conditions are applied at the true
shock position, then as the variables are integrated inwards they tend
asymptotically to the inner power law behaviour derived in subsection
4.1.1 .

Two similarity solutions are presented in Figures 4.1 and 4.2 , the
first showing a slow rotation case where the initial rotational velocity
is @xmath , and the second a faster rotation case characterised by an
initial @xmath . These values were chosen to match the solutions in
figures 1 and 2 of Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) , both to test the
modelling code and to duplicate their results. The fast rotation
similarity solution is also close to the @xmath solution from Saigo and
Hanawa ( 1998 ) , however their initial (outer) boundary conditions are
very slightly different, as the values @xmath and @xmath (compared to
@xmath in these solutions) were chosen to match onto their solutions for
runaway dynamic collapse. Despite these differences, as the inner
solution depends only upon @xmath their solution is identical to that in
Figure 4.2 in the regions interior to the centrifugal shock. Similarly,
their centrifugal shock position is close to the value for the fast
solution of @xmath .

As outlined in Section 2.7 , the outer region of the collapse
corresponds to a collapsing core just before point mass formation. For
the two solutions presented here, the outer collapse is similar, as the
difference in the initial angular momentum between the two only really
becomes important in the region close to the centrifugal shock. The
material initially falls from the outer edge at the constant radial
velocity @xmath , with the infall speed gradually increasing as the
matter nears the disc, so that in the slow rotation solution the gas is
falling onto the disc at free fall speeds. In the fast rotation
similarity solution the centrifugal shock occurs before the mass plateau
is fully established; because of this the fluid is infalling slowly when
it hits the shock.

The mass plateau forms because the material is moving inward rapidly,
with the radial pressure terms in the radial momentum equation becoming
less important as gravity and the centrifugal forces start to dominate.
The height of the collapsing flow continues to decrease as the surface
density does; because all of the matter in this region is infalling
rapidly, the pseudodisc self-gravity pulls what remains in the thin disc
towards the equator.

The increase in the gravitational and centrifugal forces causes the
formation of a centrifugal barrier occurring at approximately the
position predicted by the estimation in the previous subsection, as was
shown in Table 4.1 . The centrifugal shock moves outwards in physical
space at a velocity equal to the sound speed multiplied by the
nondimensional shock position, so that it is propagating slowly outwards
in the slow rotation case where it is located close to the origin in
self-similar space, and rapidly outwards for the fast rotation solution.
If the material is initially rotating rapidly, it may be so shocked that
it is pulled along after the shock in a backflow, before losing its
outward momentum and settling to become part of the disc. Using the jump
condition 4.57 , it is possible to show that a backflow will occur when

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

that is, when the upstream radial velocity satisfies the inequality

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

The region of backflow is usually thin, and the material is quickly
decelerated by the shocked increase in density to a value near to zero.

The passage of the centrifugal shock causes the material to be abruptly
slowed, creating a large increase in the surface density and a
flattening of the centrifugally-supported disc that forms interior to
the shock. The variables quickly settle to their asymptotic values,
taking the form of a rotationally-supported disc of material orbiting
around the origin without ever falling in, as there is no way to brake
its angular momentum. The enclosed mass in the disc decreases linearly,
as does the angular momentum. It is clear that introducing a mechanism
for braking the angular momentum will allow the material to move inwards
through the Keplerian disc and fall onto a central point mass, resulting
in the formation of a protostar at the centre of the disc. The most
obvious way to achieve this is by the introduction of magnetic braking,
which will be explored in the following section.

### 4.2 Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics Solutions

The most elementary form that the magnetic field behaviour can take is
that dictated by ideal magnetohydrodynamics (IMHD), where there is no
magnetic diffusion and the gas and magnetic field are tied by the
insistence that the mass-to-flux ratio is constant. The field is frozen
into the gas and moves with it throughout the collapse, with the
constant nondimensional mass-to-flux ratio given by its initial value
@xmath . In this situation the collapse is described by the equations:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.61)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.62)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.63)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.64)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

where the flux and field are tied to the matter and defined by the
relations

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.65)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.66)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.67)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.68)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

In this model, the presence of a magnetic braking term in the angular
momentum equation allows for the transfer of angular momentum from the
pseudodisc to the envelope, so the gas may accrete onto a central mass
(with mass @xmath ). The equation set is essentially the full set from
Chapter 2 with @xmath , save for the induction and flux conservation
equations, which have been reduced to the flux freezing descriptions in
Equations 4.65 and 4.66 .

The dimensionless form of these equations is

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.69)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.70)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.71)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.72)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

with the magnetic field terms given by

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.73)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.74)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.75)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.76)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

In order to calculate the solutions to these equations, a set of inner
boundary conditions must be derived, as the formation of a protostellar
mass at the origin changes the dynamics of the inner accretion disc. The
jump conditions for the centrifugal shock that separates the dynamic
outer collapse from the inner slowly-accreting Keplerian disc must also
be derived anew, as the requirements of flux freezing demand that the
centrifugal shock force a change in the strength of the magnetic field
as well as the density at the boundary of the inner disc. The
derivations of the conditions describing each of these phenomena are
presented in the following subsections; once their behaviour is
understood it is then possible to calculate the similarity solutions
presented in subsection 4.2.3 . The similarity solutions show how the
addition of a magnetic field changes the collapse behaviour,
particularly in the innermost regions around the newly-formed protostar.

#### 4.2.1 Inner solution

The addition of a magnetic field changes the form of the inner
asymptotic solution, allowing for the formation of a semi-Keplerian,
magnetically-diluted disc around a central point mass. It is not
possible to obtain this solution by setting the diffusion terms in the
asymptotic similarity solution derived in Chapter 3 to zero — doing this
causes the density to vanish — so the derivation of a new inner
similarity solution is performed here, using the same methodology as in
the nonmagnetic and diffusive cases.

As before, the inner asymptotic solution is assumed to take the form of
a series of power laws in @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.77)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.78)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

In this work, only those solutions in which a central mass forms are
sought, and so the domain of @xmath is limited such that @xmath . There
exists a solution in which all of the angular momentum is removed from
the collapse and no central mass may form, however no such collapse
calculations are presented in this work. For further information about
this “strong braking” solution the reader is directed to §3.2.3 of
Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) .

Adopting this limit on @xmath , the continuity equation then integrates
to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.79)
  -- -------- -- --------

(as in Sections A.1 , A.2 and A.4 ). This is substituted into Equations
4.73 and 4.75 :

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.80)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.81)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

These scalings for @xmath and @xmath are then used to define

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.82)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.83)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

The behaviour of the azimuthal component of the magnetic field is
examined by substituting the above scalings into Equation 4.76 to obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.84)
  -- -------- -- --------

of the two terms inside the brackets the term with the higher exponent
is sought, in order to satisfy the requirements of the cap on the
magnetic braking (for it is the smaller term as @xmath ). There are then
two possible values of @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.85)
  -- -------- -- --------

which implies that @xmath (this, together with @xmath , further requires
that @xmath ); or

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.86)
  -- -------- -- --------

in the case that @xmath . Using the knowledge that a
rotationally-supported disc is sought, the second of these values is
chosen (the first leads to a solution in which the surface density
@xmath is constant with respect to @xmath , and the angular momentum of
the fluid is too low to support it against gravity, preventing the
formation of a rotationally-supported disc). This implies that the
magnetic braking is strong enough in the disc that the artificial cap on
@xmath must be invoked in order to prevent the removal of all angular
momentum from the gas. While the cap is a simplistic way of limiting the
transferral of angular momentum, it is not an unreasonable assumption,
as it is expected that other effects such as a disc wind or the MRI will
prevent the field lines from twisting too much and removing all chance
of disc formation (Krasnopolsky and Königl, 2002 ) .

The scalings for all of the terms are then substituted into the angular
momentum equation ( 4.71 ), which becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.87)
  -- -------- -- --------

the exponent of the left hand term is then compared to the exponent of
each of the terms on the right hand side in order to determine which is
the dominant term. There are two possible solutions:

  -- -------- -------- -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      @xmath   @xmath      (4.88)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------- -------- -- --------

which are simplified to give

  -- -------- -------- -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      @xmath   @xmath      (4.89)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------- -------- -- --------

As the domain of @xmath has been limited to that where @xmath , the
relevant solution is clearly @xmath , so that in this inner limit the
angular momentum evolution is dominated by the magnetic braking.
Furthermore, the condition @xmath may be used to find a lower limit on
@xmath so that @xmath . Having discarded the smaller term on the right
hand side of Equation 4.87 , the constant terms in the angular momentum
equation are then rearranged to give the constant coefficient @xmath in
terms of @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.90)
  -- -------- -- --------

The vertical momentum equation ( 4.72 ), upon substitution of the above
power laws, becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.91)
  -- -------- -- --------

Once more, using the restriction that @xmath it is easy to show that
@xmath , so that the second and third term in the second set of brackets
are small and may be dropped:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.92)
  -- -------- -- --------

this equation is then rearranged into the neater form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.93)
  -- -------- -- --------

The positive solution to this quadratic is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.94)
  -- -------- -- --------

clearly as @xmath , then the second term in the square root is small and
should be disregarded, however, if this is the case then the solution to
Equation 4.94 is @xmath , which is unrealistic. Equation 4.94 can be
rewritten as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.95)
  -- -------- -- --------

which becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.96)
  -- -------- -- --------

when the second term in the square root is small. The vertical pressure
in the disc is therefore dominated by magnetic squeezing from the radial
field term in the IMHD limit, rather than the gravitational field of the
central mass. This result is to be expected from the flux freezing
condition — as the density of the disc increases in the innermost region
the flux is increased proportionately so that it quickly comes to be the
dominant force in determining the scale height of the disc.

All of the above power law scalings for the variables are then directly
substituted into the radial momentum equation ( 4.70 ) so that it
becomes

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (4.97)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

which is rearranged and simplified into

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (4.98)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

As @xmath , then @xmath and the second term in the first set of brackets
is smaller than its predecessor and can be disregarded. The first term
in those brackets scales as @xmath and as such becomes smaller than the
gravitational term as @xmath , so that the entire left hand side of
Equation 4.98 is effectively zero. Because @xmath the @xmath term may
also be dropped, and as @xmath the final term is also smaller than the
gravitational force and becomes negligible as @xmath . Thus the radial
momentum equation may be simplified into the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.99)
  -- -------- -- --------

which can be solved to give the exponents of the density and angular
momentum:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.100)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.101)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

The coefficients in Equation 4.99 are then solved for the constant
@xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.102)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and this is substituted into Equations 4.90 and 4.96 to calculate the
other coefficients:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.103)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.104)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

The full inner asymptotic solution is then given by the set of power law
relations:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.105)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.106)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.107)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.108)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.109)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.110)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.111)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.112)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.113)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.114)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.115)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

these are the same as those presented without explicit derivation in
§3.2 of Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) . In dimensional form the
similarity solution becomes:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.116)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.117)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.118)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.119)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.120)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.121)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.122)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.123)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.124)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.125)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.126)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

The disc is in near-Keplerian rotation, with the deviation from
Keplerian determined by the magnetic “dilution” factor @xmath . The
larger the mass-to-flux ratio @xmath (i.e. the less flux there is in the
initial molecular cloud) the closer the rotational speed is to that of
the nonmagnetic Keplerian disc solution in the preceding section. It is
the magnetic braking that causes this effect, as it transports the
angular momentum of the disc material to the envelope, allowing the
fluid to spiral inwards towards the central mass. For the similarity
solutions presented in subsection 4.2.3 this magnetic dilution factor is
close to one (0.939), so the discs are in near-Keplerian rotation.

Equation 4.105 shows that the magnetic dilution factor also reduces the
surface density, however the presence of the mass-to-flux ratio in the
definition of the coefficient @xmath typically has more of an effect on
the density of the inner disc, enhancing it while also reducing the
equivalent constant in the radial velocity power law relation (Equation
4.109 ). The magnetic forces determine the radial dependence of these
terms and the scale height, which becomes very small in the disc as
expected. The low infall speed ensures that the disc remains in a
near-exact dynamical equilibrium.

The magnetic field takes on a split monopole form, with the field lines
strongly inclined due to the domination of the radial component over the
vertical and azimuthal components (see Equations 4.112 and 4.113 ). The
strong magnetic field changes the dynamics of the disc from being
strictly Keplerian, and its increasing strength in the innermost regions
demonstrates the magnetic flux problem that occurs in simulations of
star formation (Li, 1998 , also Section 1.5 ) . As the angle between the
field and the disc surface is @xmath ( @xmath ) the disc is able to
drive a centrifugal wind from its surface, which would reduce the amount
of matter that reaches the origin and carry away excess flux (Blandford
and Payne, 1982 ) . Although this is not explored further in this work,
it has been shown that the presence of a disc wind could assist in
solving the magnetic flux problem (Krasnopolsky and Königl, 2002 ,
appendix C) .

As in the nonmagnetic case, the transition between the collapsing flow
and the near-Keplerian inner disc is marked by a sharp transition in the
radial velocity and surface density. The constraint of flux freezing
means that the magnetic field must also change in the shock transition
to ensure continuity. These new jump conditions are derived in the
following subsection.

#### 4.2.2 Shock position and jump conditions

Similarly to the nonmagnetic case, the position of the centrifugal shock
is found iteratively, using the behaviour of the downstream variables to
refine the shock position, @xmath , until a convergence is reached.
Because the ratio @xmath does not change greatly from its initial value
before it encounters the centrifugal shock, the initial guess used to
find the position of @xmath is that defined by Equation 4.43 from the
nonmagnetic case. Table 4.2 , which lists both the estimated and true
shock positions for the similarity solutions calculated in the following
subsection, shows that this is still an acceptable approximation to the
shock position; the difference between the estimated and actual shock
positions is typically @xmath .

There are two different sets of jump conditions used in the ideal
magnetohydrodynamics models, and the choice of which of these to use is
determined by the dominant vertical forces in the disc in the region of
the shock. For both solutions the continuity equation gives the first
jump condition to be

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.127)
  -- -------- -- ---------

as in the nonmagnetic case. Flux freezing, which takes the form of
@xmath from the induction equation, allows for the vertical field jump
condition to be given by the similar equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.128)
  -- -------- -- ---------

As before, the radial momentum equation takes the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.129)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the other terms in Equation 4.70 are small at the shock position
compared to the derivatives of the rapidly changing surface density and
magnetic field. The flux freezing condition is substituted into the
right hand side of this equation so that it becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.130)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and a good understanding of how the disc scale height behaves in the
shock region is required in order to calculate the integral of the right
hand side of this equation.

If magnetic squeezing due to the radial field component dominates the
scale height (as in the asymptotic inner solution) then @xmath and the
right hand side of Equation 4.130 becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.131)
  -- -------- -- ---------

As @xmath is constant across the shock due to the conservation of mass,
the integral of Equation 4.130 is then the final jump condition

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.132)
  -- -------- -- ---------

using the result from Section 4.1.2 for the left hand side. Denoting the
upstream and downstream variables by the subscripts @xmath and @xmath as
in the nonmagnetic case, it can be shown that these jump conditions have
one real solution that is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.133)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.134)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.135)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.136)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.137)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

The greater details of this derivation are provided in appendix B3 of
Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) , as this set of jump conditions is the
same as those for their “magnetically squeezed shock”. These jump
conditions are used in the slowly rotating collapse solution shown in
Figure 4.3 where the radial field component is already large in the
region of the shock.

The second set of possible jump conditions are those that apply when the
shock occurs in the region where the disc self-gravity still dominates
the vertical forces in the disc, so that @xmath . In this case the right
hand side of the radial momentum equation at the shock ( 4.130 ) is then

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.138)
  -- -------- -- ---------

this is integrated at the shock position to give the jump condition

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.139)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Combining this with the other jump conditions in Equations 4.127 and
4.128 gives the nontrivial solution to the jump conditions:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.140)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.141)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.142)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

which is the solution for the nonmagnetic case with the additional
magnetic factor @xmath . These jump conditions are used in the rapidly
rotating solutions shown in Figures 4.4 and 4.5 , in which the shock
occurs much earlier in the collapse process before the radial field has
built up enough to dominate the vertical squeezing.

#### 4.2.3 Similarity solutions

The IMHD similarity solutions are calculated in a similar manner to
those for the nonmagnetic model, by integrating the equations (in this
case Equations 4.69 – 4.71 ) from the outer boundary to the centrifugal
shock position, performing the jump calculations and then continuing the
integration to the inner boundary. The exact location of the shock is
found iteratively by performing the integration using an estimated shock
position (starting at the value of @xmath derived in subsection 4.1.2 )
and using the post-shock behaviour to refine the estimate of the shock
position until the integrated variables at the inner boundary match onto
the asymptotic inner solution as expected. The full details of this
routine are described in Section 5.2 for the Hall similarity solutions.

The addition of magnetic braking to the calculations causes the
formation of a central point mass, parameterised by the nondimensional
mass and accretion rate @xmath . The value of @xmath is initially
unknown, although it is first approximated by the value of the plateau
mass @xmath given by Equation 4.42 . The true value of the central mass
is determined by iteration and is typically easier to find than the
shock position, as the gravity of the central mass becomes important to
the collapse dynamics only in the innermost regions of the collapsing
pseudodisc. While small changes to the assumed value of @xmath may
greatly change the integrated values of @xmath and the surface density
at the inner boundary, the outer and mid-regions are only superficially
altered.

The full calculation, including the convergence on the true values of
@xmath and @xmath , typically takes under a minute on a current
generation desktop computer, provided that the influence of an incorrect
shock position on the post-shock variables is well-understood. A
discussion of the types of post-shock behaviour observed while trying to
calculate the shock position is provided in Chapter 5 for the Hall MHD
solutions.

The three similarity solutions presented here show a slow collapse with
initial conditions matching those in the nonmagnetic slow collapse and a
faster collapse with two different values of the magnetic braking
parameter @xmath (the ratio of the sound speed to the Alfvén speed in
the external envelope) defined in Equation 2.84 . As before, the
parameters were chosen to match those used in the solutions in §3.2 of
Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) as a mechanism for testing the model
calculations. The mass-to-flux ratio is held constant at @xmath ; and
the other initial parameters match those in the nonmagnetic solutions,
with mass parameter @xmath and infall velocity @xmath . The azimuthal
field cap is fixed at @xmath , as the azimuthal field component is
unlikely to exceed the vertical one dramatically in a real collapsing
flow. These values were chosen to match onto both the numerical
calculations of Ciolek and Königl ( 1998 ) and observations such as
those by Crutcher ( 1999 ) ; all are within the range of physical
parameters believed to be encountered in collapsing molecular cloud
cores.

All three solutions look similar to the nonmagnetic solutions from
Section 4.1 in the outer regions of the collapse, where the ratio of the
enclosed mass to the specific angular momentum is constant and the mass
scales with @xmath . However, the nonmagnetic and IMHD similarity
solutions diverge as the magnetic field builds up and the magnetic
braking begins transporting the angular momentum to the envelope,
increasing this ratio and breaking the resemblance. The behaviour of the
solutions interior to this outer collapse is determined by the initial
rotation speed @xmath and the value of the magnetic braking parameter
@xmath .

The slow rotation solution presented in Figure 4.3 is characterised by
the parameters @xmath and @xmath , corresponding to moderate rotation
and magnetic braking rates. As in the slowly rotating nonmagnetic
solution in Figure 4.1 , the mass and angular momentum plateau as the
radial velocity of the collapsing matter increases. The addition of
magnetic braking to the calculations causes a slight reduction of the
angular momentum in the plateau region from @xmath to @xmath , which in
turn reduces the centrifugal force so that the shock position drops from
@xmath in the nonmagnetic similarity solution to @xmath in the IMHD
solution.

The magnetic field builds up in the plateau region until the magnetic
squeezing comes to dominate the vertical compression of the disc, so
that it is much thinner than its nonmagnetic counterpart in Figure 4.1
(note that in Figure 4.3 and the other IMHD similarity solutions the
scale height is plotted as @xmath , while for the nonmagnetic similarity
solutions in Figures 4.1 and 4.2 @xmath is plotted directly). The scale
height is therefore approximated by @xmath and the jump conditions used
at the centrifugal shock are the first set derived in subsection 4.2.2
(Equations 4.127 , 4.128 and 4.133 ).

As in the nonmagnetic case, the matter is falling in at near-free fall
speeds as the centrifugal force builds up until it is able to counter
the influence of the central mass gravity and the centrifugal shock is
formed. The fluid is rapidly decelerated by the encounter with the ring
of increased density that is the shock front. The spike that occurs in
the surface density corresponds to an equivalent increase in the
magnetic field strength; this in turn produces a rapid drop in the
angular momentum caused by increased magnetic braking.

The post-shock region of the slowly rotating similarity solution is very
narrow, with no backflow region as may occur in rapidly rotating
solutions. After a thin transition region the flow merges into the
asymptotic magnetically-diluted Keplerian disc solution outlined in
subsection 4.2.1 . Accretion through this disc is slow and driven by the
magnetic braking, which gives @xmath its characteristic near-Keplerian
profile (which scales with @xmath ), so that the disc is in almost
perfect dynamical equilibrium. The disc mass is @xmath that of the
central mass, and the accretion rate from the disc onto the point mass
is given by @xmath ; this corresponds to a dimensional value of @xmath M
@xmath yr @xmath , which is at the high end of the range of expected
accretion rates for protostellar cores (Lee et al., 2001 ) .

Figure 4.4 shows the similarity solution for a rapidly rotating IMHD
collapse, with the same initial conditions and parameters as those in
the slowly rotating solution in Figure 4.3 save for the initial
rotational velocity which has been increased to @xmath . This is higher
than the value in the corresponding nonmagnetic similarity solution
presented in Figure 4.2 ( @xmath ), however, the two solutions are
qualitatively similar. The increase in the initial angular momentum
implies that the centrifugal force comes to balance gravity earlier in
the collapse, resulting in a much higher value of the shock position
@xmath . In this region of the flow the enclosed mass is still much
higher than @xmath , the infall rate is slow and the disc scale height
is still dominated by the disc self-gravity; the jump conditions applied
at this shock are the generalised isothermal shock conditions given by
Equations 4.140 – 4.142 .

Similarly to the fast nonmagnetic similarity solution, the centrifugal
shock in Figure 4.4 is so strong that it creates a region of shocked
backflow in the post-shock annulus. This region has a finite width in
@xmath , during which the outflowing gas is first slowed and then begins
to inflow once more as the surface density decreases from its shocked
value. The disc of accreting material is still larger than in the slowly
rotating solution, and contains approximately four times as much mass as
the central protostar. It is only in the inner regions of this disc that
the variables attain their asymptotic magnetically-diluted Keplerian
disc values, after an extended region in which the disc is
self-gravitating.

The angular momentum remains high throughout the extended disc that
forms behind the shock as the low field density implies that magnetic
braking has little effect and the outer disc regions are strongly
non-Keplerian. Because the braking is so inefficient, very little mass
accumulates at the origin compared with the slow rotation case; the
central mass is @xmath , which corresponds to a reduced accretion rate
of @xmath M @xmath yr @xmath . It is clear that increasing the angular
momentum in the initial cloud creates an angular momentum problem
similar to that encountered in the nonmagnetic case, in which the
inefficiency of magnetic braking transportation of the angular momentum
inhibits the star formation process, creating a smaller central mass
surrounded by an extended disc that very slowly falls inward.

The final plot, Figure 4.5 , shows a second rapidly rotating similarity
solution that has the same initial values as Figure 4.4 , save that the
magnetic braking parameter @xmath is reduced from 0.1 to 0.01. This
solution has even less efficient braking than Figure 4.4 , which causes
the centrifugal shock to occur even sooner at @xmath and extends the
region of backflow so that it occurs over an order of magnitude in
self-similar space. The backflow fuels the shock, but eventually the
matter slows enough that it is able to start infalling once more.

Even once the fluid is inflowing again, it takes much longer to join the
asymptotic inner solution (see the turning point in @xmath at around
@xmath ) as the low rate of infall prevents the magnetic field from
building up and compressing the disc. It is only once the magnetic field
is strong enough that the azimuthal field parameter attains its capped
value that the collapse starts to behave in a manner similar to the
asymptotic solution. As the region of inflow is reduced so too is the
central mass, with @xmath corresponding to a very low accretion rate of
@xmath M @xmath yr @xmath . Again, the mass of the
rotationally-supported and self-gravitating disc is about four times
that at the origin.

In all of the similarity solutions the magnetic braking acts to transfer
the angular momentum to the external medium, and the reduction of @xmath
or an increase in the initial angular momentum of the cloud leads to a
reduction in the amount of matter that can fall onto the central point
mass, resulting in an enhanced angular momentum problem. As the angular
momentum inside of the centrifugal shock is increased, the inner
similarity solutions tend towards a near-nonmagnetic solution similar to
that in Figure 4.2 in which no central mass is able to form.

The azimuthal field component reaches its capped value in all of the
solutions presented here, which limits the amount of magnetic braking
that is possible in the inner regions of the collapse. If this cap were
lifted then further braking could reduce the disc mass and size while
increasing accretion onto the central point mass that forms, perhaps
even to the point where no disc is able to form around the star, as in
the numerical solutions of Mellon and Li ( 2008 ) . It is clear that
limiting the magnetic braking is a solution to the problem of disc
formation, yet this needs to be better studied, either by increasing the
resolution of the numerical models so that those mechanisms which could
decrease the magnetic braking (such as nonaxisymmetric turbulence in the
thin inner disc) can be explored, or by adopting a better prescription
for the azimuthal field component in the similarity solutions.

The other major problem in star formation is introduced here in the IMHD
models: the magnetic flux problem (Spitzer, 1978 , also Section 1.5 ) ,
in which too much magnetic flux is dragged into the central protostar
and disc. This is obvious from the way that @xmath , which scales with
@xmath (and the other magnetic field components to a lesser extent),
increase dramatically in the innermost regions of disc. This problem is
exemplified by the restrictions of IMHD, as the matter is tied to the
field lines and any gas accreted through the disc will bring flux with
it, leading to a high concentration of the magnetic field in the inner
disc regions of high density and the central point mass.

The angular momentum and magnetic flux problems are mitigated by
breaking the assumption of flux freezing in the collapsing gas, which
changes the dynamics of both the angular momentum and magnetic field
transport in the pseudodisc. The first step in achieving this is to
introduce ambipolar diffusion, which causes the decoupling of the field
from the neutral particles at the densities encountered around the
beginning of the mass plateau and enhances the magnetic braking in the
forming disc. The influence of ambipolar diffusion on the collapse
process is explored in detail in the following section.

### 4.3 Ambipolar Diffusion Solutions

The last of the preliminary models used to test the code is the
non-ideal MHD calculation with ambipolar diffusion. In this model, the
field is no longer strictly tied to the neutral material, for as the
density increases the field is decoupled from the neutral particles and
is instead tied to the ions via the nondimensional ambipolar diffusion
parameter @xmath . The magnetic field is then able to be advected
against the flow, reducing the magnitude of the magnetic flux problem
that occurs in the central region of the IMHD solutions. The ambipolar
diffusion term in the induction equation becomes dominant near the
origin; this changes the structure of the inner Keplerian disc,
increasing the density and reducing the angular momentum and flux
carried inwards by the gas.

The ambipolar diffusion model is described by Equations 2.88 – 2.92 in
the limit that @xmath . For brevity these shall not be duplicated here,
however the corresponding set of nondimensional equations (originally
stated in Equations 2.104 – 2.114 ) are reproduced in the interests of
clarity, as the important terms in these equations shall be discussed in
the following subsections. These are

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.143)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.144)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.145)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.146)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.147)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.148)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

while the accretion rate and other field components are given by

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.149)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.150)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.151)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

The ambipolar diffusion calculations were the most advanced of those
performed by Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) and their solutions shall
be examined in detail in this section. In addition to the centrifugal
shock that separates the region of dynamic inflow and the slow-infall
Keplerian disc, ambipolar diffusion drives a continuous shock outwards
as it decouples the field from the neutral fluid. The position and
behaviour of these shocks, and the dynamics of the asymptotic inner disc
solution must both be discussed before the similarity solutions to the
full set of MHD equations with ambipolar diffusion can be presented and
analysed.

#### 4.3.1 Inner solution

As was mentioned in Section 3.2 , the inner asymptotic solution for the
full model with both ambipolar and Hall diffusion reduces to the
solution for a model with just ambipolar diffusion in the limit that the
Hall diffusion parameter @xmath . This solution was presented without
explicit derivation in §3.3 of Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) , and it
is reproduced here for the purpose of discussion.

The derivation of the nondimensional inner similarity solution directly
follows that in Section 3.1 so that the asymptotic power law relations
take the form:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.152)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.153)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.154)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.155)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.156)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.157)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.158)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.159)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.160)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.161)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.162)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

@xmath is the constant nondimensional mass infall rate. The dimensional
form of these variables are given by substituting the above definitions
of the constants @xmath and @xmath into Equations 3.32 – 3.42 ; the
other coefficients and the dimensional scaling of the variables are
unchanged from the inner asymptotic solution with both ambipolar and
Hall diffusion.

The inner solution represents a disc in Keplerian rotation; it is
supported against gravity by the angular momentum and has a low
accretion rate onto the central protostar (which has mass @xmath , where
@xmath is the thermal sound speed and @xmath the gravitational
constant). As in the full Keplerian disc solution discussed in Section
3.2 , the scale height and the surface density of the
centrifugally-supported disc depend upon the ambipolar diffusion
coefficient, while the magnetic field strength in the disc depends only
on the nondimensional mass infall rate and the cap on the azimuthal
component of the magnetic field.

The dimensional value of the surface density @xmath similarly depends on
the ambipolar diffusion parameter @xmath . For the position @xmath AU at
a time @xmath yr in a disc with sound speed @xmath km s @xmath ,
azimuthal field cap @xmath and accretion rate @xmath M @xmath yr @xmath
(which corresponds to a vertical magnetic field component @xmath G), the
surface density is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.163)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The size of the ambipolar diffusion parameter @xmath determines the
build-up of material relative to the magnetic field, which moves inward
slower than the neutral particles in the disc. The disc is kept in
Keplerian rotation by the ambipolar diffusion, which holds up the gas
and balances its inward radial velocity with the drift of the field
lines against the flow.

As the only real difference between this solution and the full ambipolar
and Hall diffusion solution is the change in the values of @xmath and
@xmath , which depend upon the ratio of the diffusion parameters, it
will not be discussed further here. The reader is directed to Section
3.2 and Chapter 5 for further analysis and discussion of the Keplerian
disc behaviour in the diffusive regime.

#### 4.3.2 Shock positions and jump conditions

Ambipolar diffusion causes the magnetic field and charged particles to
accrete onto the central point mass more slowly than the neutral
particles, and collisions between the neutrals and ions slow the
primarily neutral fluid so that it accretes even more slowly than in the
IMHD solution. Its importance to the dynamics of the flow depends upon
the density, and so in the outermost regions of the collapsing cloud it
has little effect on the infall rate of the field, which is ruled by
IMHD as in the previous model. However, at lower @xmath , as the
magnetic field and the density build up, ambipolar diffusion becomes
important and the field is decoupled from the neutral matter, though it
remains attached to the charged particles. The decoupling causes the
field to build up rapidly, and the magnetic forces may become stronger
than gravity as the field lines are forced to diffuse outwards against
the accreting neutrals at a speed almost as high as the accretion speed.
The compressed field lines take the form of an extended shock front that
slows the accretion and compresses the disc in the vertical direction.

This magnetic diffusion shock was first predicted to occur by Li and
McKee ( 1996 ) , and appeared in the numerical and analytic solutions of
Ciolek and Königl ( 1998 ) , Contopoulos et al. ( 1998 ) and
Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) , where it was referred to as the
“ambipolar diffusion shock”. In the model of Li and McKee ( 1996 ) the
shock was driven by the decoupling of the field from the gas by Ohmic
dissipation, however ambipolar diffusion is known to become important at
lower densities than Ohmic diffusion (see Section 1.2 for an overview)
and so it causes the development of the shock at this early stage of
collapse before Ohmic dissipation is able to decouple the field from the
gas. Ohmic dissipation does become important in the innermost and later
stages of collapse (Shu et al., 2006 ) , when the density is high and
the field becomes entirely decoupled from the gas.

The magnetic diffusion shock is of C-type (Draine and McKee, 1993 ) and
can be resolved as a continuous transition in the flow variables, so
that no explicit jump conditions need to be imposed. Li and McKee ( 1996
) showed that their shock creates a region of downstream turbulent
inflow that may be subject to interchange instabilities (Spruit et al.,
1995 ) and the Wardle instability (Wardle, 1990 ) ; it is not possible
to observe such instabilities in this model, as the turbulent region is
smoothed by the various approximations adopted, in particular the
assumption of axisymmetry. Inwards of the shock Contopoulos et al. (
1998 ) observed that the gas establishes a laminar free fall collapse,
as their simulations were nonrotating; it is the presence of rotation
that causes the formation of the Keplerian disc in this solution, while
the size of the disc is determined by the amount of magnetic diffusion
and braking.

The position of the magnetic diffusion shock, @xmath , can be estimated
by examining the induction equation ( 4.148 ). The inequality @xmath
holds true everywhere except during the shocks, and as this term is
otherwise smaller than any others it can be disregarded in order to
simplify and solve the induction equation. This can then be written as a
quadratic equation in @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.164)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The two regimes of flux behaviour, described by ideal MHD in the outer
asymptotic solution and ambipolar diffusion in the inner, can be
approximated by the two roots of this equation, which are usually
well-separated.

In the large @xmath limit, the quadratic term in Equation 4.164 becomes
small and IMHD is dominant. The smaller of the two roots is then a good
approximation to the vertical field component, and is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.165)
  -- -------- -- ---------

As this holds true during the initial dynamic collapse when the
mass-to-flux ratio is constant and given by the initial value @xmath ,
Equation 4.165 can be simplified into

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.166)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which is the initial (outer) boundary condition for the field derived in
Section 2.7 .

The larger root of Equation 4.164 gives the vertical field component in
the ambipolar diffusion regime, where it is approximated by dropping the
now-small constant (with respect to @xmath ) term in the quadratic
(Equation 4.164 ). In this case the equation is solved to give

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.167)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which is equation 50 of Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) — the smaller
root is their equation 49. Following their derivation further, inwards
of the diffusive shock position, the vertical compression of the disc is
controlled by the magnetic squeezing induced by @xmath (as @xmath is
still small). The scale height is then given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.168)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and this is then substituted into the approximation to the vertical
field component so that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.169)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The magnetic diffusion shock is smooth, even though the @xmath term is
large in the shock itself, and its position may be approximated by
recognising that just inwards of the shock the radial field component
may be approximated by @xmath . This then gives the relation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.170)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and as flux freezing is still approximately valid in this region, then
@xmath and Equation 4.170 may be solved for the position of the magnetic
diffusion shock:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.171)
  -- -------- -- ---------

(equation 58 of Krasnopolsky and Königl, 2002 ) , which depends only on
the initial conditions of the collapsing molecular cloud. This
expression is generally a good approximation to the shock position for
all of the similarity solutions explored in this section, with the
estimated and actual positions of the magnetic diffusion shocks for each
solution listed in Table 4.3 for the purpose of comparison. Typically,
Equation 4.171 gives the position of @xmath to @xmath , although it is
much closer for those solutions in which the initial rotation rate is
slow, as the centrifugal force is not yet significant, and this affects
the amount of magnetic braking and the behaviour of the scale height in
this approximation.

Inwards of the magnetic diffusion shock and its associated turbulent
post-shock region, the slowed gas is accelerated inwards by the gravity
of the central point mass until it is falling inwards at near-free fall
speeds. As in the previous solutions, the centrifugal force builds up as
the matter falls in and triggers the formation of the centrifugal shock.
In order to estimate the position of the centrifugal shock the behaviour
of the angular momentum and magnetic braking in the free fall region
must be well understood.

During the free fall collapse region, the angular momentum is reduced by
the magnetic braking in an exponential manner, and if the region is wide
enough then the angular momentum may be reduced to an essentially
constant value @xmath (which is much smaller than the first angular
momentum plateau value @xmath that is attained at the inner edge of the
IMHD region). The amplification of the magnetic field in the magnetic
diffusion shock causes an increase in the amount of magnetic braking
that is strongly dependent on @xmath , and so the value of the secondary
angular momentum plateau can not be easily approximated from the initial
conditions of the collapse.

Angular momentum is transported from the disc to the envelope by the
twisting of the field lines in the azimuthal direction, and so it is the
azimuthal field component that must be examined in order to determine
the degree of magnetic braking affecting the disc. As mentioned above,
inwards of the magnetic diffusion shock ambipolar diffusion dominates
the behaviour of the vertical field in the collapse region. Therefore,
substituting @xmath (given by Equation 4.169 ) into Equation 4.151 for
@xmath gives an approximation to the azimuthal field in this region,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.172)
  -- -------- -- ---------

this does not strictly hold true, as @xmath in the innermost area of the
free fall collapse region. Equation 4.172 is then an overestimate of the
azimuthal field near the centrifugal shock, but is an acceptable
approximation for the purpose of estimating @xmath and the position of
the centrifugal shock. In this region the angular momentum equation (
4.145 ) can be simplified into

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.173)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Substituting Equations 4.169 for @xmath and 4.172 into this equation
yields

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.174)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In this free fall region the mass is well approximated by its plateau
value @xmath (see Section 4.1.2 ), which is also a good first
approximation to the central mass @xmath . Similarly, as the matter is
falling in under gravity, @xmath , and this and @xmath are substituted
into Equation 4.174 to give

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.175)
  -- -------- -- ---------

As @xmath is small, then @xmath and the angular momentum equation may
then be simplified as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.176)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This ordinary differential equation is separable and is integrated to
give

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.177)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a constant. This exponential is a good approximation to
@xmath between the two shocks, and may be used to estimate the position
of the centrifugal shock once the boundary condition is solved. The
constant, @xmath , is the value of the second plateau in the angular
momentum, @xmath , which is used to approximate the position of the
centrifugal shock. It is calculated by evaluating Equation 4.177 at
@xmath where the angular momentum is given by the first plateau value

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.178)
  -- -------- -- ---------

assuming that there is little magnetic braking before the formation of
the magnetic diffusion shock (so that the ratio of the mass to the
angular momentum is equal to its initial value), and that the value of
the mass plateau is approximately equal to that of the central mass. The
second plateau value of the angular momentum is then given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.179)
  -- -------- -- ---------

(equation 64 of Krasnopolsky and Königl, 2002 ) ; and using Equation
4.38 , which defines the centrifugal radius, the centrifugal shock
position is approximately:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.180)
  -- -------- -- ---------

(equation 65 of Krasnopolsky and Königl, 2002 ) .

This estimate of the shock position is only valid if the centrifugal
radius occurs once the angular momentum has attained its secondary
plateau value, which makes it a poor estimate for the moderately
rotating similarity solution calculated in subsection 4.3.4 . It is,
however, a good fit to the position of the shock for the other solutions
of Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) , which are reproduced in this work
for discussion purposes. The estimated value of the angular momentum
plateau, the actual value of @xmath at @xmath and the estimated and
converged centrifugal shock positions of each of the similarity
solutions in subsection 4.3.4 are presented in Table 4.4 for the purpose
of comparison. The two estimations are intimately tied; when the angular
momentum plateau is approximated to a value close to the actual value of
@xmath at the shock, the position of the centrifugal shock is also
estimated to a high precision. The discrepancy in the calculations for
the first similarity solution is likely due to the overestimate of the
diffusion shock position (see Table 4.3 ), which affects both the value
of @xmath and the centrifugal shock position in turn.

The centrifugal shock is again treated as a discontinuity in the radial
velocity and surface density in which the flow changes from being in
near-free fall collapse to a subsonic accretion disc in Keplerian orbit.
The shock is calculated explicitly using the jump conditions derived for
the nonmagnetic model in subsection 4.1.2 (Equations 4.57 and 4.58 ), as
the magnetic field is decoupled from the neutrals in this region and so
does not change across the shock. The shock is followed by a thin
numerically resolvable post-shock layer in which @xmath increases, and
the flow then settles into its asymptotic disc solution, as will be
shown in the following subsections.

#### 4.3.3 Model construction

The addition of two further equations to the set to be integrated
complicates the numerical routine so that it is no longer possible to
integrate inwards from the outer boundary, as small numerical errors in
the calculation of the derivatives can compound and cause the
integration to veer unphysically from the expected asymptotic collapse
solution (see the inner region of Figure 4.6 for an example of this
behaviour). Similarly, it is not possible to integrate out from the
inner boundary, as the calculation rapidly breaks down in the outward
direction as well.

The solution to this problem is to treat the integration as a two-point
boundary value problem in which the values of the variables @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath and the constant boundary condition
@xmath are known at the inner and outer boundary, but unknown at an
intermediate value of @xmath (the “matching point”, denoted @xmath ).
The values of the variables at this matching point are treated as free
parameters that are initially “guessed” and refined by iteration. The
integration of the equations is performed in both directions from the
matching point, with the shock position and conditions calculated on the
inwards path, until they reach the boundaries. Here the discrepancies
between the integrated variables and the boundary conditions are
evaluated — these are initially nonzero. The integration process can
then be treated as a multidimensional root-finding problem, which can be
solved using a globally convergent Newton-Raphson procedure ( newt and
its dependencies from Numerical Recipes ; Press et al., 1992 ) . As the
differential equations are nonlinear, zeroing the discrepancies between
the integrated variables and the boundary conditions by varying the
variables at @xmath is a time-consuming process requiring many
iterations of the integration. This technique for solving two-point
boundary value problems is known as the “shooting method”, and is
discussed in more detail in chapter 17 of Press et al. ( 1992 ) .

The shooting method for solving the boundary condition problem requires
a good initial estimate of the variables at the matching point, which is
chosen such that it lies between the centrifugal and magnetic diffusion
shocks (i.e. @xmath ). This estimate is found by calculating a
simplified model of the collapse with ambipolar diffusion in which the
derivative of the vertical magnetic field component with respect to
@xmath is assumed to be small everywhere and may be disregarded. As
explained in Section 2.5 , this is generally valid because @xmath is
small everywhere (except in the magnetic diffusion shock) due to the
thin disc approximation which requires that @xmath . The induction
equation is then replaced by the approximations to @xmath that were used
in estimating the shock positions: @xmath (Equation 4.166 ) when @xmath
, and @xmath (Equation 4.169 ) when @xmath ; the position of the
magnetic diffusion shock is assumed to be that given by Equation 4.171 .
The other variables ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath ) are
integrated from the upper boundary to the matching point, creating a
solution that is close enough to the expected full solution that the
values of the variables at the matching point may be used as an initial
guess for the shooting routine.

Figure 4.6 shows such a simple calculation for the same parameters as
the full solution in Figure 4.9 (the matching point for that solution is
chosen to be @xmath ). This similarity solution is qualitatively similar
to the IMHD similarity solutions in the outer region of the collapse
where IMHD is dominant, however inwards of the magnetic diffusion shock
the vertical field component and the flux diverge from their expected
behaviour: the field becomes infinitely large as the enclosed flux
decreases rapidly, causing the integrator to fail. The percentage error
between the variables in the full solution and their values in this
simple model is shown in Figure 4.7 — the biggest discrepancy between
the two solutions is in the position of the magnetic diffusion shock,
which is located at @xmath in the full similarity solution and at @xmath
in the simple model. This incorrect shock position fuels the divergence
of the simple solution; if a more accurate estimate of the shock
location were adopted then the simple model would be able to produce
variables at the matching point that are closer to the true values.

Divergences from the expected behaviour such as those undergone by
@xmath and @xmath in Figure 4.6 can be so strong that using such values
at the matching point (even after choosing @xmath as close to @xmath as
possible) may cause the full integration to fail. Typically, adopting an
initial guess that is too far from the true values causes the
integration to either encounter a spontaneous singularity and diverge
(as in Figure 4.6 ) or to score so badly against the boundary conditions
that the routine will never converge on the true solution. In these
cases it is prudent to adjust @xmath and @xmath at the matching point by
hand until the code is able to integrate to both boundaries while
matching the boundary conditions to @xmath . Such tweaking is not always
needed, however it can be a significant additional source of overhead in
an already much-slowed process.

One other simplification is required in order to integrate inwards to
the inner boundary. Even though the position of @xmath can be calculated
to the maximum possible precision, a spontaneous singularity may occur
at some point @xmath after the solution has seemingly matched onto the
inner asymptotic solution. An example of this behaviour is shown
graphically in Figure 4.8 , in which the asymptotic solutions are shown
as dotted lines that run parallel to the similarity solution for some
length of similarity space before diverging (note that this solution has
yet to converge on the true value of @xmath ). Rather than choosing a
point just outwards of this singularity to be the inner boundary, it is
more productive to switch the integration to a simpler set of equations
while the variables are still close to their asymptotic values.

The inner singularity occurs because the derivatives for the surface
density and the vertical field component become large in the inner
regions, and in calculating these (as is required to numerically
integrate the ordinary differential equations) numerical errors compound
and cause the code to fail. In order to counteract this effect a
simplified model is used to perform the innermost integration; in this
model the problematic derivatives are given by the values from the inner
asymptotic solution in subsection 4.3.1 :

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.181)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.182)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the constant coefficient defined in Equation 4.154 .
These values are substituted into the simplified equation set:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.183)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.184)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.185)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

which is then solved for @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . The other
variables are determined by integrating the remaining differential
equations

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.186)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.187)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.188)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

to the inner boundary, whereupon the discrepancy between the boundary
condition @xmath and the integrated value of @xmath is passed back to
the shooting routine for refinement.

The simplified model is able to integrate to the inner boundary because
of the assumption that @xmath and @xmath are given by their asymptotic
expressions, which reduces the numerical error of the calculation, and
makes it possible to solve the resulting reduced set of fluid equations.
The validity of this assumption is demonstrated in Figure 4.8 , which
shows that downstream of the centrifugal shock the variables settle
quickly to their asymptotic forms and the derivatives of @xmath and
@xmath calculated using the full set of equations are close to the
asymptotic values. Because of this, adopting the simple model is not
expected to introduce any significant errors to the calculations,
provided that it matches well to the full solution.

The transition between the full and simplified models occurs when both
the derivatives of @xmath and @xmath match their asymptotic values in
Equations 4.181 and 4.182 to an appropriate degree. In most of the
solutions calculated in the following subsection and the Hall diffusion
solutions in Chapter 5 , matching the derivatives to 1% is considered
acceptable for switching between the two models, although a finer match
may be required if the solution is otherwise unable to converge. The
transition is usually seamless, however if not all of the values of the
variables (particularly @xmath ) at the matching point have converged,
or if the criteria for changing between the models is not vigorous
enough, the point of transition may be visible in the plots, as occurs
to @xmath in Figure 4.12 just inwards of the expanded shock region. If
the variables (including @xmath ) at @xmath are particularly poorly
chosen then the simple model may also encounter spontaneous
singularities as it integrates inwards.

Even with a good estimate of the variables at the matching point as
input to the root-finding routine, and the simplified model for
calculating the innermost integrals, the calculation of the true
solution with its minimized scores (typically of order @xmath ) may take
up to a day to compute. The initial step of finding a set of variables
at @xmath that would integrate to both boundaries was not fully
automatable, as poor guesses would cause the code to crash in ways that
could not always be predicted or accounted for. Multiple iterations of
this procedure were often necessary to ensure convergence on the value
of the central mass.

#### 4.3.4 Similarity solutions

The ambipolar diffusion similarity solutions are calculated using the
method outlined above, however only the first of the ambipolar diffusion
solutions from Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) was calculated as a test
of the computation code; this similarity solution is shown in Figure 4.9
. Their other ambipolar diffusion solutions are reproduced in Figures
4.11 – 4.13 in order to properly examine and discuss the role of
ambipolar diffusion in the star formation process. The initial
conditions and parameters of all of the similarity solutions presented
in this section are given in Table 4.5 .

The similarity solutions presented in this section have much in common
with the IMHD solutions, as the basic interplay between the magnetic,
gravitational and centrifugal forces remains the same. However, altering
the coupling between the gas and the magnetic field allows the field
lines to be transported from the innermost regions of the collapse to
the outer ones, reducing the magnetic flux problem so there is less of a
magnetic field excess near the origin. Similarly, the magnetic braking
is reduced by the presence of ambipolar diffusion, so that the magnetic
braking catastrophe may be resolved completely.

The amount of ambipolar diffusion present in the solutions is determined
by the nondimensional parameter @xmath , which is a constant of order
@xmath . The justification for this is that in the outer regions of
collapsing cores at radii @xmath AU, the grains have a typical radius
@xmath m, the temperature is @xmath K and the cosmic ray ionisation rate
is given by @xmath s @xmath (where @xmath ; Ciolek and Mouschovias, 1998
; Kamaya and Nishi, 2000 ) . The ambipolar diffusion parameter is given
by @xmath when the scaling of the ion density is proportional to the
square root of the neutral density (see Section 1.2 ) and the molecular
ionisation by cosmic rays is balanced by rapid dissociative
recombination of the molecular ions.

Further inward, at radii @xmath AU where the density is higher, the
temperature in the collapsing core is around @xmath K (where @xmath ).
The ambipolar diffusion parameter is then given by @xmath Å @xmath (see
Krasnopolsky and Königl, 2002 , for the justification of this
approximation) , where @xmath is the average grain size, assumed in this
region to be small singly-charged particles that are PAH-like (Neufeld
and Hollenbach, 1994 ) . This relationship breaks down during the
intermediate regions where Hall diffusion is expected to be important,
however, given that the value of @xmath only changes by an order of
magnitude over 8 orders of magnitude in density, choosing a constant
@xmath of order 1 is an acceptable parameterisation for the ambipolar
diffusivity. The value of the diffusion parameter is varied in the
solutions presented in this section in order to properly explore the
role played by ambipolar diffusion in self-similar collapse, and its
variation is discussed further in Section 6.2 .

Figure 4.9 shows the only ambipolar diffusion similarity solution
calculated in this work, which was performed in order to test the code
for solving the collapse problem with both Hall and ambipolar diffusion
and confirm the results of Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) . It has the
same initial (outer) conditions as the fiducial solution in §3.3.1 of
their work: the density parameter is @xmath ; the initial radial
velocity is parameterised by @xmath ; the nondimensional mass-to-flux
ratio is @xmath and the initial azimuthal velocity is @xmath . This core
is initially rotating at a rate that would be termed fast in the
previous models, however the changed magnetic braking caused by
ambipolar diffusion in the azimuthal direction causes the centrifugal
force to remain unimportant until @xmath is small. The magnetic braking
parameter is given by @xmath , which is slightly reduced from the value
@xmath used in the IMHD solutions; the azimuthal field cap remains at
@xmath for simplicity (so that the maximum value of the azimuthal field
is @xmath ) and the ambipolar diffusion parameter is chosen to be @xmath
, which is slightly larger than that expected.

The outer regions of the ambipolar diffusion collapse match those from
the IMHD similarity solutions, as the mass-to-flux and the
mass-to-angular momentum ratios remain constant as the material falls in
at supersonic speeds. The radial velocity and scale height are dominated
by the self-gravity of the disc, which pulls the gas towards the equator
before it then flows towards the central mass. The magnetic field
gradually builds up as the matter falls inwards, and it becomes
important to the dynamics at around @xmath where the magnetic braking
starts to affect the angular momentum transport and the constant ratio
of the mass to the angular momentum breaks down. The azimuthal field
component attains its capped value, and is important to the angular
momentum transport throughout the rest of the collapse.

The mass and angular momentum tend towards their plateau values as in
the previous solutions, and ambipolar diffusion becomes important to the
field transport as the surface density and magnetic field build up. The
gravity of the central point mass becomes important to the radial
velocity — this pulls more mass and flux inwards until ambipolar
diffusion causes flux freezing to break down.

The magnetic diffusion shock at @xmath (which is much smaller than the
estimated position of @xmath ; see Table 4.3 ) takes the form of a
sudden increase in the vertical field component as the field lines
diffusing against the flow from the downstream ambipolar
diffusion-dominated regime meet those coming inward with the IMHD
collapse. The sudden increase in the field causes the gas to slow down
due to the magnetic pressure terms in the radial momentum equation (
4.144 ) and the magnetic squeezing terms come to dominate the vertical
compression of the disc. The particular dip in the scale height at the
shock suggests that the rapid compression of the disc causes a breakdown
of the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium in the shock; in reality the
magnetic squeezing at the shock should produce a smooth reduction of the
disc thickness over the shocked region.

IMHD breaks down at around the position of the magnetic diffusion shock
where @xmath (and by extension @xmath ) have fallen to a plateau value.
This value is not affected by the addition of ambipolar diffusion to the
calculations, so that the amount of flux contained within @xmath is
roughly that trapped at the origin in the IMHD solutions. Ambipolar
diffusion causes the flux to be redistributed downstream of the magnetic
diffusion shock, so that no flux is contained at the origin.

The decoupling of the field from the neutral particles primarily takes
place at the magnetic diffusion shock, which also changes the disc
geometry. Upstream of the shock, the magnetic field is dominated by the
radial component, which can be an order of magnitude larger than the
vertical and azimuthal field components. During the shock and the
transition region that follows downstream of it, the field lines
straighten until the poloidal components at the disc surface are
approximately equal; this field geometry is illustrated in Figure 4.10 .
Relative to the vertical component @xmath drops in the shock, however
the decoupling of the field causes the magnetic braking rate to increase
so that the azimuthal field component increases by a factor of 1.5
during the immediate post-shock region.

Inside the magnetic diffusion shock the poloidal field components scale
with @xmath as the surface density and thickness of the disc increase
and the radial velocity and accretion rate drop. The gas is slowed due a
weak outward acceleration caused by the radial magnetic pressure, and
this in turn causes the density to rise. Rotation is not dynamically
important in this region and so the shock has a similar structure to
that seen in the nonrotating similarity solution of Contopoulos et al. (
1998 ) . The gravity of the central mass eventually overcomes the
magnetic pressure and the gas starts accelerating inwards once more.

As in the slowly rotating similarity solutions obtained from the IMHD
and nonmagnetic models, rotation remains dynamically unimportant until
the vicinity of the centrifugal shock. For most of the region between
the two shocks the gravity of the central mass dominates the radial
acceleration of the gas until it is in near-free fall collapse, slowed
only a little by ambipolar diffusion of the magnetic flux and the
magnetic pressure. The azimuthal field component increases in this free
fall region until it is again equal to the vertical component, which
causes the change in the scale height behaviour at @xmath as it
contributes more to the magnetic squeezing forces in the pseudodisc. By
this point the enclosed mass and the accretion rate have flattened and
remain near-constant throughout the remainder of the collapse. The
angular momentum has yet to reach its second plateau value (see Table
4.4 ) when the centrifugal force becomes large and triggers the
formation of the Keplerian disc.

Eventually the centrifugal force becomes equal to the gravitational
force and the centrifugal shock occurs at @xmath , which is much smaller
than the estimated value @xmath (see Table 4.4 ). This discrepancy is
likely caused by the overlarge estimate of the magnetic diffusion shock
radius used to approximate the centrifugal shock position. In this
similarity solution the shock is not strong enough that it can create a
region of backflow, however the gas is slowed so that the infall is now
subsonic and the surface density increases by more than an order of
magnitude.

The centrifugal shock is followed immediately by a very thin layer in
which the azimuthal and vertical magnetic field components increase
rapidly. This increase causes a decrease in the angular momentum to its
asymptotic value, as the surface density and the other variables adjust
with a few overshoots towards their expected rotationally-supported disc
behaviour. The transition between the full model and the simplified set
of equations outlined in subsection 4.3.3 occurs at @xmath , after the
variables have joined onto the asymptotic inner disc described by
Equations 4.152 – 4.162 .

The Keplerian disc itself is rather small compared to that in the
rapidly rotating similarity solutions without ambipolar diffusion (as
@xmath corresponds to a disc radius of @xmath AU at time @xmath years),
and it has a mass @xmath that is @xmath that of the central point mass.
The nondimensional mass at the origin is @xmath , which corresponds to a
moderate accretion rate of @xmath M @xmath yr @xmath (so that at time
@xmath yr, the central mass is @xmath M @xmath ). The surface density of
the disc depends upon the ambipolar diffusion and azimuthal field cap
parameters, as does the infall velocity, which is subsonic and very low.
The disc is extremely thin and the vertical squeezing is dominated by
the tidal and self-gravitational forces.

Within the rotationally-supported disc the angular momentum problem of
star formation is solved as the disc is in Keplerian orbit, and as the
flux is clearly reduced from the constant value in the IMHD solution the
magnetic flux problem is seemingly resolved as well. The amount of
magnetic flux in the disc scales with @xmath , so that @xmath as @xmath
; clearly the amount of flux present in the protostar depends upon more
detailed flux transport and destruction mechanisms than are included in
this model, such as Ohmic diffusion (e.g. Li and McKee, 1996 ) and
reconnection (e.g. Galli and Shu, 1993b ; Lazarian, 2005 ) .

Figure 4.11 , reproduced from figure 8a of Krasnopolsky and Königl (
2002 ) , shows a slowly rotating similarity solution with the same
initial conditions as Figure 4.9 , save for the initial azimuthal
velocity which has been reduced from @xmath to @xmath . This solution is
qualitatively similar to that in Figure 4.9 in the outermost region
where IMHD is dominant; the values of the angular momentum and the
enclosed mass plateau as the magnetic braking and ambipolar diffusion
start to become important to the flux and angular momentum transport. In
this region the self-gravity of the disc and the gravity of the central
mass dominate the forces on the radial velocity so that it increases
rapidly, and rotation is not yet important to the dynamics of collapse.

The magnetic diffusion shock occurs further from the origin in this
solution at @xmath , which is much closer to the estimated position
@xmath than in the previous similarity solution. This occurs because the
reduced rotational support allows more gas and flux to fall inwards so
that the ambipolar diffusion term becomes important sooner, triggering
the shock. Ambipolar diffusion comes to dominate the field transport
inwards of the magnetic diffusion shock as the increase in the vertical
field component at the shock is stronger in this solution than in the
previous solution. The post-magnetic diffusion shock transition region
is smoothed by the reduction in the initial angular momentum — the
radial velocity only decreases very slightly downstream of the shock
before accelerating inwards once more.

The decrease in the initial azimuthal velocity changes the width of the
free fall region between the two shocks, as there is less angular
momentum to trigger the formation of the centrifugal shock. The
azimuthal field component reaches its capped value at around @xmath
(where @xmath has its maximum turning point in Figure 4.11 ), so that it
is better able to transport the angular momentum from the disc than in
Figure 4.9 . In this solution @xmath falls to the second plateau value
given by @xmath , which matches the predicted value quite well (see
subsection 4.3.2 for more on the formation of this angular momentum
plateau).

The centrifugal force becomes large enough to balance gravity and cause
the formation of the centrifugal shock at @xmath , which is an order of
magnitude smaller than in the moderately rotating similarity solution,
and also smaller than the @xmath IMHD solution in Figure 4.3 . The
horizontal scale in the post-centrifugal shock region has been expanded
to show that there is no overshoot and adjustment period inwards of the
shock; the variables tend directly towards their asymptotic solutions.
The Keplerian disc in this similarity solution is much smaller than in
Figure 4.9 (corresponding to only @xmath AU at a time @xmath yr), and it
contains a mass that is only @xmath of the central mass @xmath
(corresponding to @xmath M @xmath yr @xmath ; values from Krasnopolsky
and Königl, 2002 ) . The central point mass has increased compared with
the more rapidly rotating similarity solution; this also occurred in the
slow and fast IMHD solutions, suggesting that the reduction in the
initial azimuthal velocity causes a reduction in the radial support
which allows more matter to accrete in the slower similarity solutions.

The third solution, plotted in Figure 4.12 (figure 8b of Krasnopolsky
and Königl, 2002 ) is another slowly rotating collapse, with initial
conditions matching those in Figure 4.11 save that the ambipolar
diffusion parameter is reduced from @xmath to @xmath . Both shocks move
even further inwards as predicted by the theory outlined in subsection
4.3.2 , because the decrease in ambipolar diffusion causes the build up
of flux necessary to trigger the magnetic diffusion shock to be a slower
process. The post-magnetic diffusion shock region in which the density
increases and the infall is slowed is more dynamic than in the previous
slowly rotating solution, however the magnetic field does not increase
downstream of the shock as in the more moderately rotating Figure 4.9 .

The width of the near-free fall region in logarithmic space is again
increased in comparison to the other slow similarity solution, and the
degree of magnetic braking is increased, so that it takes longer for the
angular momentum to reach its second plateau value of @xmath and balance
gravity. The centrifugal shock at the boundary of the Keplerian disc
occurs at @xmath (which corresponds to @xmath AU at @xmath yr), showing
that the amount of ambipolar diffusion (as well as the initial rotation
rate) determines the size and mass of the rotationally supported
protostellar disc, which in this similarity solution has only 0.4% the
mass of the central point mass. The mass at the origin is unchanged by
the reduction of @xmath , remaining constant at @xmath ; this implies
that the amount of ambipolar diffusion does not affect the accretion
rate onto the central star. Again, the variables match rapidly onto
their asymptotic values, the surface density within the disc is
decreased and the infall velocity is higher than in the other slow
solution in Figure 4.11 .

The final ambipolar diffusion solution in Figure 4.13 is a rapidly
rotating collapse with an initial azimuthal velocity @xmath and magnetic
braking parameter @xmath , matching the parameters of the IMHD solution
presented in Figure 4.4 . The ambipolar diffusion parameter is restored
to @xmath so that the amount of diffusion is high, however it is not
large enough to generate a magnetic diffusion shock as in the previous
solutions. The infall rate in the outer regions is slow, and is already
dropping towards zero when the gas encounters the centrifugal radius. As
the gas is rapidly rotating, the centrifugal force becomes large early
in the collapse (as in the fast IMHD solution), and the centrifugal
shock causes the already slow radial velocity to become a backflow,
representing a ring of material downstream of the shock forcing it
outwards.

As most of the momentum of the gas is in the azimuthal direction, the
radial velocity is always slow and subsonic (even in the backflow
region) in this solution. Downstream of the centrifugal shock the
magnetic braking reduces the angular momentum as the density and
magnetic field (which are still tied by flux-freezing until around
@xmath ) increase until ambipolar diffusion becomes important and the
variables settle with a number of overshoots to the asymptotic values at
around @xmath . Note that the disc mass is much larger (by an order of
magnitude) than the central point mass which has @xmath , and that at
the inner edge of this plot the enclosed mass has yet to plateau to its
asymptotic value. Although the accretion rate onto @xmath is slow (
@xmath M @xmath yr @xmath ), the disc is very large in comparison, so
that by a time of @xmath years the disc has radius @xmath AU and is
orbiting a “protostar” of mass @xmath M @xmath , which is startlingly
small. Without the requirement of axisymmetry, such a disc would
experience gravitational instability and fragment, leading to the
formation of a small cluster of stars (e.g. Matsumoto and Hanawa, 2003 )
.

The addition of ambipolar diffusion to the model changes the dynamics of
the gravitational collapse process by decoupling the magnetic field from
the neutral particles at moderate densities so their behaviour is no
longer tied by flux freezing. Because of this, less magnetic flux is
carried inwards to the origin than in the IMHD model, and the magnetic
flux problem of star formation is essentially resolved. The change in
the field behaviour also allows more angular momentum to be transported
to the external envelope by magnetic braking, which helps solve the
angular momentum problem. The inner Keplerian disc is changed by the
inclusion of ambipolar diffusion, which affects the radius of the disc
and the surface density and infall velocity of the gas inwards of the
centrifugal shock. These are all expected to be further changed by the
inclusion of Hall diffusion, which alters the magnetic behaviour of the
collapsing core further from that in the simple models.

### 4.4 Summary

Three forms of gravitational collapse were described within this
chapter: a nonmagnetic model, an ideal MHD model, and finally one with
ambipolar diffusion as the dominant flux transport mechanism in the
collapsing flow once the density is high enough that flux freezing
breaks down. These were intermediate models constructed as part of the
process of building and testing a model of rotational molecular cloud
core collapse that shall demonstrate the influence of both ambipolar and
Hall diffusion, which shall be described in the following chapter. The
solutions here were reconstructions of those by Krasnopolsky and Königl
( 2002 ) , and their results were duplicated in order to test the code
calculations. Comparisons were also made to other collapse simulations
in the literature, demonstrating the power of the self-similar
formulation as a tool for exploring the physics of star formation over a
wide range of densities and length and time scalings.

In order to ensure that the similarity solutions matched onto
appropriate inner boundary conditions, the inner asymptotic power law
solutions describing the collapse behaviour close to the origin had to
be derived; for each of the models these took the form of
rotationally-supported accretion discs. The outer boundary of these
discs was marked by a shock discontinuity that occurred near the
centrifugal radius, and the exact position of this shock determined the
matching onto the inner asymptotic solution. The jump conditions, and an
estimation of the centrifugal shock position were derived, and for the
ambipolar diffusion model an estimate of the magnetic diffusion shock
position was also derived.

The ambipolar diffusion model required the calculation of a simplified
model for the purpose of estimating the variables at a matching point
located between the two shocks, which is used as the initial guess in
the shooting routine. Inside of the centrifugal shock, a second
simplified model is used to perform the innermost integration and ensure
convergence on the true similarity solution. The numerical procedures in
each version of the model code were briefly described, along with a
discussion of the numerical instabilities and complexities that limit
the precision of the similarity models. Finally, similarity solutions of
interest in each case were presented and the physics discussed, in order
to explore the effect of the magnetic field transport, the magnetic
braking and the initial rotation rate in the core on the collapse
process.

The nonmagnetic model (Figures 4.1 and 4.2 ) has no way to brake the
angular momentum in the gas, so the angular momentum-to-mass ratio,
@xmath , is a constant that parameterises the similarity solutions. The
pseudodisc thickness is dominated by its self-gravity, as is the radial
velocity. In these solutions the fluid falls in from the outer
asymptotic solution describing a rotationally-flattened core undergoing
supersonic collapse just before point mass formation. The centrifugal
force builds up until it is able to balance the gravitational force,
triggering the formation of the centrifugal shock.

The shock represents a sudden deceleration of the infalling matter as it
encounters a wall of increased density at the boundary of the inner
disc, which is supported by the radial pressure and rotation. The
variables quickly settle to their asymptotic disc behaviour, and as
there is no way to brake the angular momentum the gas cannot fall
inwards through the disc to the origin, so that no central mass is able
to form. The disc has a constant (with @xmath ) azimuthal velocity
@xmath , which depends only upon the initial ratio @xmath .

The size of the inner disc depends upon the initial azimuthal velocity
in the core relative to the mass. As the ratio @xmath increases, the
centrifugal force becomes important earlier in the collapse, resulting
in a larger disc. If this initial velocity is sufficiently high then the
material can be pulled along after the shock in a backflow for quite
some time before the gravity of the protostar causes it to lose its
outward radial momentum and settle onto the centrifugally-supported
disc. This backflow appears in all of the similarity solutions discussed
in this work that have a high initial rotation rate.

The ideal MHD model (Figures 4.3 – 4.5 ) saw the introduction of a
magnetic field to the collapsing core. The field is frozen into the
material, moving with it so that the nondimensional mass-to-flux ratio
@xmath remains constant throughout the collapse; a magnetic braking term
included in the angular momentum equation allows for the removal of
angular momentum from the thin disc to the external envelope by Alfvén
waves. This braking allows matter from the rotationally-supported disc
to lose its angular momentum and spiral down to the origin, creating a
central point mass of nondimensional mass @xmath .

In the IMHD solutions the inner disc is in near-Keplerian rotation, as
the magnetic pressure term in the radial momentum equation aids the
centrifugal force in supporting the disc against collapse. As flux is
dragged into the central point mass with the gas (creating a magnetic
flux problem) the field takes on a split monopole form with the field
lines strongly inclined in the radial direction. The dominance of the
radial magnetic field component over the vertical component also appears
in the discs of the ambipolar diffusion model, and is strong enough in
both models to drive a centrifugal disc wind from the surface, although
such behaviour is not explored in these models.

The amount of angular momentum in the initial core continues to affect
the size of the protostellar disc, with rapidly rotating cores forming
larger discs. It also affects the central point mass so that those cores
with a higher initial rotational velocity form larger discs with smaller
point masses, as accretion through the disc is low and subsonic.
Reducing the amount of magnetic braking further reduces the central
point mass, and causes the backflow region outside of the disc, in a
core that was initially rotating rapidly, to be extended so that the
magnetic and rotationally-supported disc is much smaller than in those
solutions with higher rates of magnetic braking.

The inclusion of ambipolar diffusion in the similarity solutions
(Figures 4.9 – 4.13 ) reduces the magnetic flux problem induced in the
IMHD solutions by redistributing the flux in the central protostar
throughout the inner disc and the surrounding near-free fall collapse
region. The boundary between the ambipolar diffusion-dominated free fall
and the outermost dynamic collapse where IMHD is still dominant is
marked by the magnetic diffusion shock, which is a thin (but numerically
resolvable) discontinuity in the vertical magnetic field strength. The
magnetic field is increased rapidly by the decoupling of the field from
the infalling neutral particles; this causes a compression of the
pseudodisc thickness by magnetic squeezing and an increase in the amount
of magnetic braking affecting the collapsing flow. This additional shock
is a feature of the ambipolar diffusion similarity solutions that is not
present in the simpler models; the infalling gas is slowed as the
density increases in a post-shock transition region before the gravity
of the protostar comes to dominate the radial acceleration and the
matter begins to infall at near-free fall speeds.

The mass of the protostar and the size of the rotationally-supported
protostellar disc both depend on the amount of ambipolar diffusion in
the flow, as the decoupling of the field from the neutral particles
causes an increase in the magnetic force that slows the inflow and
reduces the accretion rate onto the protostar. The size of the disc
depends also on the amount of magnetic braking and the initial rotation
of the core: reduced braking or a larger value of @xmath correspond to a
larger rotationally-supported disc; stronger braking or a low initial
rotation rate lead to a smaller disc, or the prevention of disc
formation entirely. The density, scale height and infall velocity within
the inner Keplerian disc all depend upon the ratio of the ambipolar
diffusion parameter to the azimuthal field cap, which limits the amount
of magnetic braking in the disc; the surface density scales with @xmath
as expected in protostellar accretion discs. The disc is
rotationally-supported with a low infall speed, so that the angular
momentum problem is effectively resolved.

A clear problem with all of the models is the cap on the azimuthal field
parameter, which limits the amount of angular momentum that can be
removed from the collapsing core and ensures disc formation. Although
not duplicated in this work, Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) also
produced a similarity solution with @xmath and @xmath , in which the
magnetic braking was so strong that all angular momentum was removed
from the gas and no rotationally-supported disc could form (see their
§3.3.3 and Section 6.2 for a discussion of this similarity solution).
Similarly, the numerical simulations of Mellon and Li ( 2008 , 2009 )
and others have shown that magnetic braking is more than capable of
suppressing disc formation, which could have serious consequences for
studies of protoplanet formation. Overstrong magnetic braking may be
responsible for observations of slowly rotating YSOs without discs (e.g.
Stassun et al., 2001 ) , as such stars could have formed in cores that
were so strongly braked that not only were they unable to form a
rotationally-supported disc but the angular momentum of the protostar
itself was braked during collapse.

This magnetic braking catastrophe is unresolved at present, however,
Hall diffusion has been neglected in previous simulations of star
formation. Hall diffusion changes the amount of magnetic braking
affecting the collapsing flow, either increasing or decreasing it
depending upon the sign of the Hall parameter; this changes the dynamics
of the collapse by allowing more or less matter to fall onto the central
protostar, and affects the infall rate through the inner Keplerian disc
by providing more or less magnetic support. This behaviour is explored
in the following chapter in which Hall diffusion is introduced into the
self-similar collapse model.

## Chapter 5 Collapse with the Hall Effect

The introduction of Hall diffusion modifies the behaviour of the
collapsing fluid, changing the size and strength of the magnetic
diffusion shock, the effect of magnetic braking and the radius of the
rotationally-supported disc in the central regions of the collapse. The
sign of the Hall parameter, which corresponds to the orientation of the
magnetic field with respect to the axis of rotation, can reduce the
complexity of the similarity solutions when it is negative or add to it
when the Hall parameter is positive. Additional shocks may form in the
post-shock regions downstream of the magnetic diffusion and centrifugal
shocks; these slow the infall and reduce the accretion onto the central
protostar.

The model that is used to find the similarity solutions is a modified
version of that used in Section 4.3 to calculate the solutions with only
ambipolar diffusion. The full set of self-similar equations derived in
Chapter 2 are integrated from a matching point across a wide range of
@xmath until they match onto the initial supersonic collapse of a
molecular cloud core at the outer boundary and the Keplerian disc
described in Chapter 3 at the inner boundary. Only the induction
equation and the azimuthal field component are changed from their
counterparts in the ambipolar diffusion model, as both of these need to
account for Hall diffusion:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

(Equations 2.109 and 2.114 ). The other equations remain unchanged from
those used in the ambipolar diffusion model; they are reproduced here
from Equations 2.104 – 2.113 for ease of reference:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.3)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.4)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.5)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.6)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.7)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.8)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.9)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.10)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.11)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

This chapter aims to show the importance of the Hall effect in
gravitational collapse by outlining the construction and results of the
model with Hall diffusion. The inner asymptotic solution for the
Keplerian accretion disc shall be briefly recapped in Section 5.1 before
the numerical procedure for finding the similarity solutions is outlined
in Section 5.2 . This is followed by a discussion of the behaviour of
the shocks and their positions in Section 5.3 , which also contains an
exploration of the importance of the Hall term in determining the size
of the centrifugally-supported disc and the region bounded by the
magnetic diffusion shock. Finally, a series of similarity solutions are
presented and discussed in Section 5.4 , demonstrating how the Hall term
changes the dynamics of the flow, and how the orientation of the field
with respect to the axis of rotation influences the size of the
accretion disc. Hall diffusion also introduces additional shocks into
the flow and modifies the accretion rate onto the central protostar;
these will be briefly discussed in the context of the magnetic braking
catastrophe, which will be described more fully in Chapter 6 .

### 5.1 Inner Asymptotic Solution

The inner asymptotic solutions to the collapse with both Hall and
ambipolar diffusion were the focus of the derivation and discussion
contained in Chapter 3 . As this work is principally concerned with the
influence of the Hall effect on the disc formation problem in star
formation, only those similarity solutions in which a Keplerian disc
forms around the protostar are calculated in this chapter. These
solutions are characterised by the existence of an accretion disc around
the central mass which is described by the set of power laws with
respect to @xmath in Equations 3.18 – 3.28 , which are reproduced here
for clarity:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.12)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.13)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.14)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.15)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.16)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.17)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.18)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.19)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.20)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.21)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.22)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

The constant @xmath is the nondimensional central mass infall rate, and
@xmath is the artificial cap placed upon @xmath to prevent it from
becoming the dominant field component in the innermost regions of the
disc. The diffusion constant @xmath is a function of the ambipolar and
Hall diffusion parameters, and is given by the equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

this definition shows how the Hall term is able to counteract the
ambipolar diffusion term in determining the surface density of the disc
and the accretion rate onto the central protostar when the
nondimensional Hall parameter @xmath is positive, and add to the
ambipolar diffusion if the Hall parameter is negative. The
characteristic parameter of the disc, @xmath , must be positive lest the
surface density be negative; this places limits on the allowed relative
sizes of the two diffusion parameters that must be satisfied in order to
form a Keplerian disc.

The full physical meaning of this solution is discussed at length in
Section 3.2 . To summarise, the inner accretion disc is in Keplerian
rotation, with the centrifugal force balancing the inwards pull of
gravity. The accretion rate onto the protostar is constant and low, and
accretion through the disc is determined by the total amount of magnetic
diffusion, which removes radial support by the magnetic field and allows
the gas to fall inwards.

Section 3.3 described another asymptotic solution in which the magnetic
braking is so strong that all angular momentum is removed from the gas
which free falls onto the protostar without forming a disc. No
similarity solutions matching onto this inner solution are calculated in
this work, but the similarity solution with no Hall diffusion but strong
magnetic braking, and its role in describing the magnetic braking
catastrophe are discussed further in Chapter 6 .

The Keplerian disc equations, in particular Equations 5.12 and 5.19 ,
are the inner boundary conditions that must be evaluated to test the
accuracy of any individual integration and satisfied in the true
similarity solution. The method in which these are employed to ensure
convergence of the shooting routine for finding the similarity solutions
shall be described in the following section.

### 5.2 Numerical Method

The numerical procedures used to calculated the similarity solutions are
relatively unchanged from those used in the ambipolar diffusion model,
save for those changes that were necessary to handle the additional
complications introduced with Hall diffusion. As mentioned previously,
sonic points and subshocks occur downstream of the magnetic diffusion
and centrifugal shocks, which may be the “viscous subshock” mentioned in
Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) , although these do not appear in their
published solutions. Locating and integrating through such shocks
requires the introduction of new routines that monitor the integration
and perform such adjustments as are necessary.

Overall the iterative routine for finding the correct similarity
solution remains unchanged, using the globally convergent
multidimensional Newton-Raphson root-finding routine ( newt and its
dependences, converted to double precision) from Numerical Recipes
(Press et al., 1992 ) . This routine performs a series of integrations
(using the routine shoot ) from the unknown initial values to the
boundaries whereupon the difference between the integrated variables and
the boundary conditions are evaluated. Each of the initial values is
perturbed in turn, and the Jacobian of the shooting routine is
calculated; newt then uses the inverse of the Jacobian to determine the
changes to the initial values necessary to zero the discrepancies. This
step is then taken and assessed (a smaller change in the variables is
made if needed) and the process is repeated until the shooting routine
converges on the true solution. Once the initial values are close enough
to the true solution the Newton-Raphson routine will converge
quadratically.

As in the ambipolar diffusion model, the problem is recast as a
two-point boundary value problem in which the variables are integrated
from a matching point @xmath to both the inner and outer boundaries, as
depicted in Figure 5.1 . The matching point is located at a position
@xmath , and is typically chosen to lie just downstream of the magnetic
diffusion shock and upstream of any subshocks that may occur. The values
of the variables @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath at @xmath
are initially unknown but may be estimated by integrating a simplified
set of equations as shall be outlined in subsection 5.2.1 . The initial
value of the central mass parameter @xmath is estimated using the
plateau value defined in Section 4.1 :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

The integration itself is performed using either a fifth order
Runge–Kutta step ( rkqs ) or a Bulirsch–Stoer semi-implicit midpoint
rule step ( stifbs ) as the equations may be stiff, requiring a
different method of integration. The driver routine for both is odeint ,
which exerts an adaptive stepsize control to improve the accuracy and
efficiency of the integration; all of these routines and their
dependencies were taken from Numerical Recipes (Press et al., 1992 ) and
have been converted to double precision.

Integration in the outwards direction is usually performed without
difficulty unless a particularly poor guess of the values of the
variables at @xmath is employed. As the magnetic diffusion shock is
continuous, both routines for stepping through the integration are able
to integrate through it without pause. At the outer boundary (which is
usually located at @xmath or @xmath ) the variables are compared to the
outer boundary conditions outlined in Section 2.7 :

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.25)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.26)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.27)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.28)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

the difference between these variables and their boundary values is
passed to the root-finding routine as a score that must be minimised.
Both rkqs and stifbs give similar results so they may be used
interchangeably; stifbs is typically used for the outer integration,
while rkqs is used for the inwards path, as stifbs occasionally fails
downstream of the centrifugal shock.

Integrating in the inwards direction is more problematic, as the
calculation is very sensitive both to the initial values of the
variables at @xmath and the Hall diffusion parameter @xmath . Close to
the magnetic diffusion shock (downstream of @xmath ) there may occur a
subshock in which the supersonic (but slowing due to the sudden increase
in @xmath at the magnetic diffusion shock) inflow is abruptly slowed to
a subsonic rate. This only occurs when the Hall parameter is positive,
and is likely caused by the change in the azimuthal field in the shock
affecting the downstream magnetic braking. This subshock is a sharpening
of the post-shock variation of the density and infall speed in the
ambipolar diffusion solution in Figure 4.9 , and its position and jump
conditions (discussed in Section 5.3 ) must be calculated explicitly
using the method to be described in subsection 5.2.2 .

The magnetic diffusion subshock’s existence is detected by performing a
test integration inwards; if the variables approach a sonic point (where
@xmath ) then a shock must exist before this point. Downstream of the
subshock a sonic point occurs as the radial velocity becomes supersonic
once more; this is integrated through using the method described in
subsection 5.2.3 . Past this point, the variables are integrated without
any further interruption until they reach the centrifugal shock.

The centrifugal shock is located by integrating to an upper bound on the
shock position and then calling the iterative routine outlined in
subsection 5.2.2 which tests the initial guess of the shock position
@xmath and refines this guess based upon the downstream behaviour of the
variables. Once @xmath is known as precisely as possible, the variables
are integrated to the shock position and the jump conditions (again
described in subsection 5.3.3 ) are evaluated. Downstream of this shock,
if the Hall parameter is positive, one or more subshocks may occur. As
with the magnetic diffusion subshock, the centrifugal subshocks are
preceded by a sonic point that must be calculated carefully and then the
subshock position is found using the same iterative process as the
centrifugal shock. Inwards of these shocks the variables approach the
expected asymptotic behaviour outlined in Section 5.1 .

In the innermost regions of the collapse the derivatives @xmath and
@xmath become very large in comparison to the other derivatives. These
can cause @xmath and @xmath to become large, and small numerical errors
in the calculation of these derivatives and their integrals can cause
the appearance of a spontaneous singularity in which the variables
diverge dramatically from the asymptotic similarity solutions. This
behaviour is avoided by simplifying the calculation of the derivatives
in this region using the expected asymptotic behaviour of the variables;
the simplified equations, and the criteria used to match onto this
simple model are described in subsection 5.2.4 .

When the inwards integration reaches the inner boundary (typically
located around @xmath , depending upon the position of @xmath ) the
variables are compared to the inner boundary conditions

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.29)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.30)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

The difference between the expected boundary value and the integrated
variable are passed back to the shooting routine, which modifies the
initial values at @xmath and begins the next iteration of the
integration. The similarity solution is considered to have converged
when the integrated variables match the boundary condition values to at
least 0.002%. Due to the ease of convergence in the outwards direction,
the outer boundary conditions match the integrated variables to a much
higher degree.

Some of the earlier (low @xmath ) similarity solutions were calculated
using a modified shooting routine that only integrated in the outwards
direction. This method required the adoption of specific values of
@xmath and @xmath , which were held constant as the root-finding routine
minimised the scores at the outer boundary; only after that convergence
was achieved was the inwards integration performed and the values of
@xmath and @xmath altered. This process was repeated until the initial
values were properly converged. While this method was less efficient
than the full version of shoot that integrates in both directions, due
to the complications involved in integrating inwards (especially when
multiple subshocks exist in the solution) this was often a more reliable
mechanism for solving to the full set of boundary conditions.

Both methods require a good initial estimate of the values of the
variables at @xmath and take at least a full day to compute on a desktop
machine. If a particularly poor initial guess at the matching point is
chosen, or if more than one sonic point occurs in the collapse, the
calculation may require close monitoring to ensure that integration in
the inwards direction proceeds as expected and convergence on the true
solution takes place.

#### 5.2.1 Simplified model

The initial guess of the variables at the matching point is estimated by
calculating a simplified model in which the induction equation is
replaced by an algebraic expression for the vertical field component. As
the derivative of @xmath is a negligible term in the equations (see
Section 2.5 ), when the fluid equations are integrated inward from the
outer boundary the evaluation of @xmath causes the integration to become
unstable. Removing this term allows the induction equation to be written
as an algebraic expression for @xmath as a function of the other
variables. The other equations are unchanged, and using the expression
for @xmath it is possible to integrate these from the outer boundary to
the matching point @xmath . This simplified model is quite similar to
the one constructed for the ambipolar diffusion collapse in Section 4.3
, differing only in the inclusion of the Hall diffusion term.

With the exception of during the magnetic diffusion shock where @xmath
changes rapidly, the inequality @xmath holds true everywhere during the
collapse; and as this term is always small compared to the other terms
in the induction equation it may be dropped. The magnitude of the
magnetic field @xmath is always of order @xmath , so that it may be
approximated by @xmath where @xmath is a constant that depends on the
relative sizes of @xmath and @xmath . The induction equation may then be
written as a quadratic in @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

The two well-separated roots of this equation provide an acceptable
approximation to the behaviour of @xmath on either side of the magnetic
diffusion shock, with the prescription

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

(which is unchanged from that in the ambipolar diffusion model) applying
in the large @xmath regime where flux freezing still mostly holds true
and the mass-to-flux ratio is given by its initial value @xmath . This
is equivalent to the initial condition for the vertical field component
on the outer boundary derived in Section 2.7 ; although IMHD breaks down
before the magnetic diffusion shock this remains a good approximation to
the field in this region.

The larger root of the two gives the value of the vertical field
component in the magnetic diffusion regime where @xmath is small. It is
approximated by dropping the constant (with respect to @xmath ) term in
the quadratic equation ( 5.31 ) and solving for @xmath to obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

which reduces to Equation 4.167 in the ambipolar diffusion limit.

The transition between the two approximations to @xmath occurs at the
magnetic diffusion shock, @xmath , the position of which is estimated in
Section 5.3 . The matching point is usually taken to be @xmath depending
slightly upon the position of the magnetic diffusion shock and its
potential subshocks, and @xmath is estimated by the plateau value in
Equation 5.24 . Figure 4.6 showed such a simple model for the ambipolar
diffusion calculations — inwards of the matching point the variables
diverged from the expected values due to the poor guess of @xmath used.

The values of the variables at the matching point from this simple model
are often a good enough guess to the true values that the code is able
to use them as the initial values for the iterative root-finding routine
that solves the full set of equations. In those cases where this is not
a good estimate (typically when @xmath ), the values of @xmath and
@xmath are adjusted by hand until the shooting routine is able to
integrate in both directions and match the boundary conditions to
approximately 10%. Once this is achieved the root-finding routine is
typically able to converge on the similarity solution.

#### 5.2.2 Iterative routine for locating the shock position

The position of the centrifugal shock, @xmath , is found by employing a
simple binary search over an appropriate interval. The upper and lower
bounds on this position are initially described by @xmath where @xmath
is the estimated value that is derived in Section 5.3 . Once the
position of the shock has been found for the initial guess of the
variables, a smaller pair of limits and the previous value of the shock
position may be used in later integrations, as @xmath does not vary
greatly in its position with changing initial values of the variables at
@xmath . The variables are integrated down to the estimated position of
@xmath , where the jump conditions from subsection 5.3.3 are applied,
and then integrated inwards towards the inner boundary. Unless the shock
position is known very precisely, the variables will approach their
asymptotic values and then veer off course.

This behaviour is most clearly seen in the surface density @xmath ,
which increases rapidly downstream of the shock if @xmath is an
overestimate to the true shock position, and decreases dramatically if
@xmath is an underestimate. The incorrect estimate is then assigned to
be the new upper or lower boundary on the shock position as appropriate,
and a new estimate of the shock position is chosen at the midpoint
between the boundaries. As the position of the shock is more precisely
known, the variables follow the expected asymptotic behaviour for
longer, as can be seen in Figure 5.2 .

When the shock position is known to approximately ten decimal places, it
is considered to be known to the precision of the full calculation, as
the precision of the integration itself (typically to around @xmath )
limits the accuracy of all other calculations. Note that even when the
position of the shock is known “precisely” (as is the case with the
solid black plot in Figure 5.2 ), the integrating routine is unable to
complete the integration all the way to the inner boundary. As was the
case in the ambipolar diffusion model, a simplified set of equations
need to be integrated from a point far from the centrifugal shock, where
the variables follow their asymptotic behaviour, to the inner boundary.
The simplified set of equations with Hall and ambipolar diffusion and
the matching criteria is outlined in subsection 5.2.4 .

The potential presence of a sonic point and subshock does not
particularly interfere with the initial iterative routine for finding
the shock position. When there exists a sonic point downstream of the
shock, if @xmath is too high then @xmath bounces upwards at the sonic
point, as seen in Figure 5.3 a, while if @xmath is too low then the
integration fails at the sonic point as demonstrated in Figure 5.3 b.
The same iterative routine may then be used to find the shock position
even when the shock is followed by one or more subshocks.

Downstream of any of the sonic points the iterative routine must again
be employed to find the position of the associated shock front that
follows. In this instance the upper boundary of the search ( @xmath ) is
initially chosen to be the sonic point, and the lower boundary is
located at a value of @xmath ; these typically enclose the shock. The
behaviour of the variables downstream of the subshock is the same as
that downstream of the principal shock, so the binary search described
above is able to locate the true shock position without alteration, and
once @xmath has been found the variables typically match onto the
simplified set of equations used to integrate to the inner boundary
without difficulty.

#### 5.2.3 Subshocks

Perhaps the most obvious difference between those solutions in which the
Hall parameter is positive and those with no or negative Hall diffusion
is the presence of subshocks downstream of either or both of the
magnetic diffusion and centrifugal shocks as described in the previous
subsection. To date only one magnetic diffusion subshock has been found
in the similarity solutions, however many subshocks may occur downstream
of the centrifugal shock. These subshocks occur after the density
increase in the principal shock causes the gas to be slowed to a
subsonic speed. The gas is abruptly halted as the magnetic or
centrifugal forces overcome the radial gravity, causing another steep
density increase.

The first of these subshocks, downstream of the magnetic diffusion
shock, occurs when the post-shock density increase is so steep that the
gas is slowed dramatically, eventually forming a shock front. This shock
can be seen in Figure 5.5 , which is a close view of the magnetic
diffusion subshock in the @xmath , @xmath similarity solution presented
in Section 5.4 . At this shock the azimuthal field component is
increased suddenly, and this straightening of the field at the
pseudodisc surface slows the fluid. There are discontinuities in the
scale height and the vertical field derivative, and the corresponding
increase in @xmath also increases the amount of magnetic braking
downstream of the shock.

As described in the introduction to this section, the magnetic diffusion
subshock occurs when the integration tends towards a numerical sonic
point downstream of the principal shock; this sonic point would see the
radial inflow become subsonic gradually, while the code rapidly
encounters an unphysical singularity and fails. This is clearly
undesirable and the solution to this behaviour is to use the iterative
routine described in the previous subsection to find the subshock
position, using the magnetic diffusion shock position as the upper
boundary and the sonic point position as the lower boundary. Once the
subshock position is known it is possible to integrate from the magnetic
diffusion shock to the subshock, and from there towards the centrifugal
shock.

Downstream of the magnetic diffusion subshock the radial velocity
increases gradually under the influence of gravity; it passes from
subsonic to supersonic at a sonic point that must be calculated
explicitly. The singularity in the radial momentum equation ( 5.5 ),
occurring when @xmath , prevents the smooth integration through this
point as @xmath diverges; this behaviour is prevented by checking the
value of @xmath at each intermediate point between the magnetic
diffusion subshock and the sonic point. When @xmath then a small manual
step (or series of steps) is taken by evaluating the derivatives and
multiplying these by the stepsize @xmath to give a small change to the
variables. This change is added to the variables to give the value at
the new position, @xmath , which is written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

for each of the variables @xmath . If @xmath has not passed through the
sonic point this manual step is repeated as necessary until it has. Once
past the sonic point the gas flow tends towards the free fall collapse
behaviour as in the ambipolar diffusion solutions.

Similarly, those subshocks that occur downstream of the centrifugal
shock form because the density increase in the shock is narrow, and once
past the sharp peak of the shock the matter starts falling inward again
at a rapid rate. This behaviour can be seen in Figure 5.5 , which again
is a close view of the similarity solution with @xmath and @xmath
focussing on the centrifugal subshock; the surface density and other
variables overshoot their asymptotic behaviours and the infall quickly
becomes supersonic once more. The centrifugal force remains important,
and once the infalling material has overcome the increased magnetic
pressure caused by the increase in the field downstream of the shock it
starts to fall in under gravity once more, so that the centrifugal force
causes the gas to be shocked once more. Multiple subshocks occur as the
Hall parameter becomes large — the increasing number of subshocks make
it computationally difficult for the iterative root-finding routine to
converge on the true similarity solution, preventing the publication of
larger positive Hall parameter solutions in this work.

The presence of the centrifugal subshock is indicated by the presence of
a sonic point downstream of the principal centrifugal shock, in which
the infall speed seemingly passes from being subsonic to supersonic in a
smooth manner. As with the magnetic diffusion subshock, this sonic point
is caused by the singularity in the radial momentum equation and is
manually integrated through using Equation 5.34 . The position of the
subshock downstream of the sonic point is found iteratively using the
routine outlined in subsection 5.2.2 , using the sonic point @xmath as
the upper bound and a position 0.6 @xmath as the lower bound. If
multiple subshocks exist (caused by the steep increase in the magnetic
field and correspondingly the magnetic pressure) then this behaviour
will be repeated, with the first subshock being followed by an
additional sonic point and then a second subshock. This behaviour is
repeated until the variables match onto the inner asymptotic solution
and can be integrated without further intervention to the inner
boundary.

The jump conditions calculated at all of the subshocks are those jump
conditions used for the centrifugal shock that shall be outlined in
Section 5.3 . It is possible that as the positive Hall parameter becomes
larger the magnetic diffusion subshock may require different jump
conditions that take the twisting of the magnetic field lines due to the
Hall effect into account; for the solutions presented in this work such
changes were unnecessary.

Subshocks do not occur in those similarity solutions where the Hall
parameter is negative, as the reduced radial magnetic field diffusion
causes the post-shock regions to be smoothed and less dynamic. The
variables match onto the expected behaviour downstream from the shocks
with smaller overshoots, and the shocks themselves are weaker. Making
the Hall parameter increasingly negative (while keeping the ambipolar
diffusion parameter constant) reduces the severity of the magnetic
diffusion shock (much as reducing @xmath does). Furthermore, tweaking
@xmath changes the amount of magnetic braking affecting the disc, as
larger negative values of @xmath lead to @xmath attaining its capped
value faster; the reduced flux in the inner regions of the pseudodisc
slows the rate of magnetic braking so that the centrifugal shock occurs
sooner in the collapse process.

#### 5.2.4 Simplified inner integration

As can be seen in Figure 5.2 , the shooting routine is sometimes unable
to integrate the equations all the way to the inner boundary, even when
the position of the centrifugal shock is known as accurately as
possible. The divergence from the true similarity solution occurs
because the derivatives @xmath and @xmath become very large downstream
of the centrifugal shock and associated subshocks; the accumulation of
small numerical errors and the contributions of small terms in the
equations leads to a situation in which the integrated variables veer
away from the expected asymptotic solutions.

In order to avert this behaviour and integrate to the inner boundary,
the method used in the ambipolar diffusion model (described in Section
4.3 ) is reproduced here for the full model with both Hall and ambipolar
diffusion. This simplification sees the MHD equations replaced by a
simplified set that can be integrated all the way to the inner boundary.
In this calculation the problematic derivatives that become large are
replaced by approximations that are derived from the expected inner
asymptotic solution that was outlined in Section 5.1 , that is,

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.35)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.36)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

These are then substituted into the appropriate MHD equations so that
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are then found by solving Equations
5.1 , 5.2 , 5.5 and 5.7 simultaneously, leaving only Equations 5.3 , 5.4
and 5.6 to be integrated.

Switching between the full and simplified models takes place after the
minimum turning point in the surface density when the variables have
joined the inner asymptotic solutions, but before they diverge from the
expected behaviour. Typically this switch occurs when the old and new
values of @xmath match to within 0.01/ @xmath (which is @xmath of the
value from the full set of equations) and @xmath calculated using both
methods matches less well to around 200/ @xmath ( @xmath ). As in the
ambipolar diffusion model this means that, in general, the transition
between equation sets is visually seamless; the required precision of
the match is raised from those stated here when the transition is
visible and the change in the derivatives is apparent — such a slope
change would clearly influence the accuracy of the calculations. When
the precision of the match is as high as possible the change between the
two equation sets is smooth.

The simplified set of equations is not subject to the same numerical
instabilities as the full set unless the initial values of the variables
at the matching point are a particularly poor guess of the true values.
Should such a guess be adopted then the routine is unable to match onto
the simplified model, and the failure of the inwards integration is used
to refine the values at the matching point. Using a simplified set of
equations to integrate to the inner boundary is not expected to
introduce significant errors into the calculation.

The shooting routine can then continue the integration to the inner
boundary where the difference between the integrated variables and the
boundary conditions are evaluated and the values of the variables at the
matching point are adjusted.

### 5.3 Shocks

The inclusion of Hall diffusion in the collapse changes the position and
behaviour of the magnetic diffusion and centrifugal shocks, and can
cause there to be subshocks associated with these. As mentioned
previously, when the Hall diffusion parameter @xmath is positive the
increased magnetic forces and braking may cause the formation of
subshocks, while the strength of the shocks is reduced and the dynamics
of the post-shock regions smoothed when the Hall parameter is negative.

An analytic estimate of the shock positions is necessary for the
calculation of the simple model described in subsection 5.2.1 and as an
initial guess for the iterative routine in subsection 5.2.2 ; these are
derived in subsections 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 for the magnetic diffusion and
centrifugal shocks respectively. The shock positions depend upon the
Hall parameter, as the outwards diffusion of the field leads to the
formation of the magnetic diffusion shock, and the magnetic braking
determines the position of the centrifugal shock, and Hall diffusion is
important to both of these processes. For simplicity, the subshocks
shall not be examined analytically at this point, as they were
adequately described in the preceding sections, and their positions are
usually well-estimated by those of the principal shock they follow. The
Hall diffusion parameter does not affect the jump conditions applied at
the shocks (described in subsection 5.3.3 ), although its influence on
the shock position and the values of the density and magnetic field at
this point does change the intensity of the shock.

#### 5.3.1 Magnetic diffusion shock position

The first shock encountered by the collapsing flow is the decoupling
front in which flux freezing breaks down and the magnetic field
behaviour comes to be dominated by Hall and ambipolar diffusion.
Similarly to the calculation of the magnetic diffusion shock position in
the ambipolar diffusion model in Section 4.3 , @xmath is estimated by
examining the vertical magnetic field behaviour on both sides of the
shock. In the outermost regions of the core the material is collapsing
inward at a near-free fall rate, ideal magnetohydrodynamics holds true,
and the vertical field component is given by @xmath defined in Equation
5.32 . Inwards of the magnetic diffusion shock, the magnetic diffusion
terms are important to the field transport and the drift of the magnetic
field depends on the coupling between field lines and charged species;
in this region the vertical field component may be approximated by
@xmath , which was given in Equation 5.33 .

When calculating the position of the magnetic diffusion shock for the
ambipolar diffusion model, it was noted that downstream of the shock the
thickness of the disc was controlled by magnetic squeezing. The scale
height of the disc may then be approximated by the relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

this is then substituted into Equation 5.33 to give

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the coefficient of @xmath such that @xmath . If the
field components are approximately equal interior to the magnetic
diffusion shock as expected then @xmath and @xmath , and the magnitude
of the total field strength (in terms of @xmath ) is then

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

These relationships are then substituted into Equation 5.38 , which
becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

Assuming that the mass-to-flux ratio is still constant in this regime
and close to its initial value (this is not strictly true, as flux
freezing does break down upstream of the magnetic diffusion shock), it
is possible to solve this equation and obtain an estimate of the
position of the magnetic diffusion shock:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

which reduces to Equation 4.171 in the ambipolar diffusion limit.

It was shown in subsection 4.3.2 that this equation was a poor match to
the similarity solution in which @xmath , @xmath and @xmath (Figure 4.9
), although it did provide an adequate approximation to the shock
position when the initial azimuthal velocity is lower. It is also a poor
match for those similarity solutions with both ambipolar and Hall
diffusion calculated in this work: although the magnetic diffusion shock
positions plotted against the nondimensional Hall diffusion parameter in
Figure 5.7 show that the relationship between the two is near-linear,
the dashed plot of Equation 5.41 is clearly a very poor match to the
data, as is the dot-dashed plot which shows the result of deriving
Equation 5.41 under the assumption that @xmath rather than the value
given by Equation 5.39 . The solid line is the best linear fit to the
data (using an equation of the form @xmath ); the parameters of this fit
are given in Table 5.1 .

Clearly the linear estimation to the magnetic diffusion shock position
given by Equation 5.41 is a poor match to the data from the similarity
solutions (with a typical error of @xmath ); even the simplified form of
this equation with @xmath is unable to fit the data. A more accurate
estimation of the shock position is therefore required, and the largest
source of error in this calculation is the approximation to @xmath used
in @xmath (that @xmath ).

On the upstream side of the magnetic diffusion shock @xmath (as can be
seen in the solutions as Section 5.4 ), however downstream of the shock
the azimuthal field component is not equal to @xmath as was assumed. The
magnetic field lines are compressed in the shock resulting in an
increase in the vertical field and the azimuthal field as the field
lines are twisted up by the slowing of the compressed gas. Conservation
of flux ensures that the radial field component does not change in the
shock.

The magnetic diffusion shock represents a continuous increase in the
magnetic field strength, and though the matter is slowed in the
post-shock region, @xmath is near-constant and @xmath throughout the
magnetic diffusion shock itself. While the vertical field component
increases from @xmath to @xmath , the azimuthal component downstream of
the shock is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

using the subscripts @xmath and @xmath to indicate the upstream and
downstream sides of the shock. Equation 5.32 is then substituted into
this equation, and this is solved for @xmath downstream of the shock:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

As @xmath in all of the similarity solutions, @xmath in this region and
there is no need to include the azimuthal field component in the
magnetic squeezing; downstream of the shock the disc scale height may
still be approximated by Equation 5.37 and the magnitude of the magnetic
field (in terms of @xmath ) is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

These are then substituted into Equation 5.38 for the downstream
vertical field component

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is then possible (using the approximation that @xmath ) to rearrange
this into a new estimation of the magnetic diffusion shock position

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

which again reduces to Equation 4.171 in the ambipolar diffusion limit.

The dashed curve in Figure 5.7 illustrates Equation 5.46 ; this is a
much better fit to the shape of the data from the similarity solutions
although it is still an overestimation of the actual magnetic diffusion
shock positions which are represented by crosses. Multiplying Equation
5.46 by a constant @xmath gives an approximation to the magnetic
diffusion shock position (shown as the dot-dashed curve in the figure)
that is good enough that it may be used in the simple model for
calculating the initial value of the variables at @xmath ; this constant
may be assumed to replace some missing physics in this approximation.
Table 5.2 compares the derived equation to the parameters for the solid
curve of best fit in Figure 5.7 , which takes the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are constants; these parameters are similar to
their equivalents from the derived estimation to the magnetic diffusion
shock position, with the largest different arising in the calculation of
the constant @xmath as expected.

The curved approximation to @xmath (when multiplied by the constant
0.83) is accurate to within @xmath of the true value for all of the data
in Figure 5.7 , and to within @xmath for @xmath . Even Equation 5.46
without the constant is accurate to within @xmath of the true values,
which is much better than the linear analytic estimate given by Equation
5.41 . It is the nonlinear estimate of @xmath (using the factor of 0.83)
that is used in the simple model, and in calculating the initial
estimate of the centrifugal shock position @xmath .

#### 5.3.2 Centrifugal shock position

The presence of Hall diffusion in the model complicates the calculation
of the centrifugal shock position as its dependence on the prescription
for @xmath (Equation 5.2 ) makes it much more difficult to solve the
angular momentum equation ( 5.6 ) explicitly, to the point where the
method used to estimate @xmath in the ambipolar diffusion model is not
duplicated in this chapter. Instead, the approximation to the
centrifugal shock position from the ambipolar diffusion model is taken
and modified to include Hall diffusion in a simplistic manner.

In order to find the centrifugal shock position, the iterative routine
requires an estimate of @xmath that is accurate to around 20%, as the
routine described in subsection 5.2.2 is very flexible and able to cope
with most poor initial guesses of this shock position. Starting then
with Equation 4.180 for the centrifugal shock in the limit where @xmath
,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

the nondimensional ambipolar diffusion parameter is replaced by a term
@xmath that includes both Hall and ambipolar diffusion, as well as the
magnetic braking parameter:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

This equation, depicted as the dashed line in Figure 5.8 , is a poor
match to the shock position data from the similarity solutions (listed
in Table B.2 ).

Although Equation 5.49 gives a position that is typically close enough
to the true value that the routine will succeed in finding @xmath , a
better match to the behaviour of @xmath is sought as finding the
position of @xmath is one of the slower parts of the model to compute.
Equation 5.49 can be somewhat improved by multiplying the magnetic
diffusion term by the constant 0.83 that was used to improve the
determination of @xmath ; this then gives the equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is shown as the dot-dashed line in Figure 5.8 . As can be seen
from the plot, this approximation to @xmath is only close enough to be
used as a first guess in the shock-finding routine when @xmath .

The remainder of the Hall parameter space is mapped by the linear
relation plotted as the dotted line in Figure 5.8 , which has the
equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

while this approach is simplistic, and required the calculation of a
number of similarity solutions before it could be adopted, it provides
an acceptable guess of the centrifugal shock position to the iterative
routine described in 5.2.2 for solutions with @xmath (and @xmath ). This
linear relationship is a more refined form of the linear extrapolation
(from the two closest solutions in @xmath -space) that was used to
estimate the shock position before an analytic estimate was available.

All of the shocks that require explicit calculation of the jump
conditions share the same set of jump conditions, which are outlined in
the following subsection.

#### 5.3.3 Jump conditions

As in the first ambipolar diffusion solution of Chapter 4 , the magnetic
diffusion shock in these similarity solutions is smooth and continuous,
and does not require any explicit calculation of shock conditions. The
shock itself is a transition between the two approximations to the
vertical field component, @xmath and @xmath , and in the shock front
only @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are changed, with @xmath downstream of
the shock given by @xmath (see Figure 5.5 and subsection 5.3.1 ). At the
shock @xmath is dramatically compressed, suggesting that a breakdown of
the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium occurs at this point. In reality,
the enhanced magnetic squeezing during the shock front is unable to
reduce the disc thickness so dramatically over the fluid transit time
through the shock, and the magnetic pressure far exceeds the gas
pressure so that any breakdown of isothermality would not greatly affect
the collapse.

On the other hand, the jump conditions at the centrifugal shock must be
explicitly calculated at the position found using the iterative routine
described in subsection 5.2.2 . The shock conditions at @xmath are those
derived in Section 4.1 for the nonmagnetic solutions; these were found
by integrating the conservation of mass and radial momentum equations (
5.4 and 5.5 ) at the shock position to give the relations

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.52)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.53)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

These equations are then solved simultaneously to give the non-trivial
solution to the jump conditions

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.54)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.55)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath denote the upstream and downstream sides of the
shock.

The magnetic field strength does not change at the centrifugal shock
front itself, as the magnetic pressure and tension terms are not large
enough during the shock transition to change the field behaviour,
however it typically increases in the regions immediately interior to
the shock as the other variables settle to their asymptotic values. The
centrifugal shock is the boundary of the rotationally-supported disc and
as the position of this shock depends on the Hall diffusion parameter so
too does the strength of the shock, with stronger shocks occurring with
increasing Hall parameter. The increased magnetic diffusion can also
cause the formation of subshocks — rings of sharply-enhanced density in
the post-centrifugal shock region — as the outward-moving flux causes
the infalling gas to be slowed.

The jump conditions defined in Equations 5.54 and 5.55 are also used for
any subshocks that may be encountered downstream of the principal
shocks. Although the magnetically-squeezed jump conditions defined in
Section 4.2 could be applied at the magnetic diffusion subshock, they
produce numerically similar results to the jump conditions defined above
and so no benefit was seen to adding this complexity to the code. The
second set of jump conditions derived in Section 4.2 only apply when
IMHD holds true and could not be used for any of the subshocks
encountered in this model, as magnetic diffusion is always active near
to the shock fronts.

Having summarised the behaviour, jump conditions and the ways in which
both the principal and subshocks affect the numerical routines that
integrate the ordinary differential equations that define the
self-similar collapse problem, it is now possible to calculate the
similarity solutions.

### 5.4 Hall Solutions

Superficially, the similarity solutions within this section appear to be
similar to those of the ambipolar diffusion model in Section 4.3 . They
all have the same parameters and boundary conditions, outlined in Table
5.3 , which match those in Figure 4.9 and figure 7 of Krasnopolsky and
Königl ( 2002 ) . The nondimensional ambipolar diffusion parameter is
held constant at @xmath , as is the cap on the magnetic braking @xmath
and the magnetic braking parameter @xmath , so that the only changes
between the similarity solutions presented here and the ambipolar
diffusion-only solution in Figure 4.9 are those wrought by the addition
of Hall diffusion. The values of the variables at the matching point
@xmath for a selection of similarity solutions are given in Table B.3 ;
interpolating between these it is possible to obtain a good initial
guess of the variables for the calculation of a similarity solution with
any value of the Hall parameter @xmath .

The first of these similarity solutions is that presented in Figure 5.9
for the self-similar collapse of a molecular cloud with @xmath . Those
similarity solutions that possess a negative Hall parameter have more
radial diffusion of the magnetic field against the neutral fluid and the
charged grains (see the induction equation, 5.1 ), so that the magnetic
pressure builds up much earlier in the collapse process, triggering the
formation of the magnetic diffusion shock. The negative Hall parameter
also increases the initial rate of magnetic braking (by increasing the
first term in the brackets of Equation 5.2 ) so that @xmath attains its
capped value much earlier in the collapse, and the magnetic braking is
then determined by the strength of the vertical field component (see the
right term in the brackets of Equation 5.2 ).

As in the previous solutions, at the outer edge of the collapse the
matter is falling in supersonically under IMHD, bringing the magnetic
field with it. As the surface density builds up the field does so too,
causing the magnetic pressure terms to become important, while the
magnetic braking transports angular momentum from the infalling gas to
the external envelope by twisting the magnetic field lines. The angular
momentum and enclosed mass start to plateau as the dominant force on the
radial velocity changes between the self-gravity of the disc and the
gravity of the central mass, which in turn causes the accretion rate to
taper off. The formation of the magnetic diffusion shock at @xmath ( cf.
@xmath in the ambipolar diffusion similarity solution with the same
parameters) is caused by the decoupling of the field from the neutral
particles.

The magnetic diffusion shock in this solution is weaker than that in
Figure 4.9 as most of the neutral particles and the grains have already
been decoupled from the magnetic field, so that the vertical field
component increases by only 4.5 times (as opposed to 6.2 times in Figure
4.9 ). The scale height is less compressed by the field, producing a
thinner shock, while @xmath does not grow rapidly under the build up of
flux and braking in the shock. Within the shock the field is further
decoupled from the neutral particles and charged grains, allowing Hall
and ambipolar diffusion to become more important downstream of the shock
and throughout the remainder of the solution. The field lines straighten
as in Figure 4.10 ; although the radial field component is still
dominant, the vertical component increases in the shock until it is just
smaller than @xmath .

Downstream of the magnetic diffusion shock the surface density gradually
increases as the infall velocity is slowed by the increased magnetic
support. This post-shock region is smoother than that without Hall
diffusion, presenting a gentler transition to the free fall collapse
that occurs outside of the rotationally-supported disc. The vertical
field scales with @xmath during the post-magnetic diffusion shock region
as the increased radial magnetic diffusion means that there are fewer
field lines in total moving against the flow of the neutral particles.
In this region the disc scale height is dominated by the magnetic
squeezing; the gravity of the central mass becomes the most important
radial force on the gas at the end of the post-shock region (the peak in
the surface density) and the matter is accelerated inwards until it is
in near-free fall collapse. The magnetic braking decreases the angular
momentum rapidly until @xmath attains its capped value and @xmath begins
to plateau once more.

The centrifugal force builds up as the matter falls inwards until it
exceeds the gravitational force, triggering the formation of the
centrifugal shock at @xmath ( cf. @xmath in Figure 4.9 ). This shock is
a discontinuity in the surface density and the radial velocity, which is
again less strong than that in the solution without Hall diffusion, and
inwards of this the vertical and azimuthal field components increase
steeply throughout the post-shock reaction of the field (although @xmath
remains capped at @xmath ). Downstream of the centrifugal shock the
variables tend (with overshoots in @xmath ) towards their asymptotic
values.

The inner disc is in Keplerian rotation and satisfies Equations 5.12 –
5.23 for the given parameters. The central mass is given by @xmath ,
which is decreased from the non-Hall solution ( cf. @xmath ) and
corresponds to an accretion rate onto the central star of @xmath M
@xmath yr @xmath . The scalings with respect to @xmath of the other
variables are the same as in Figure 4.9 (see Section 5.1 ), however the
surface density is increased by the changed magnetic diffusion parameter
@xmath (compared to @xmath ) and the increased radial magnetic diffusion
causes the strength of the magnetic field threading the disc to be
decreased from that in the ambipolar diffusion-only solution. This in
turn means that less matter can lose its angular momentum by magnetic
braking and fall onto the central mass, so that the gas is at a higher
surface density in this larger Keplerian disc.

The next similarity solution, presented in Figure 5.10 , shows the
results of a calculation with @xmath on the same scale and with the same
parameters as Figure 5.9 . The total radial magnetic diffusion is
further increased in this solution so that many of the neutral particles
have decoupled from the field before the diffusion shock; this causes
the intensity of the magnetic diffusion shock at @xmath to drop further
so that the increase in the vertical field strength is only 4 times its
original value. There is less of a magnetic wall at this point as less
of the field needs to be decoupled from the neutrals within the shock
itself.

As in the previous solution with a negative Hall parameter the
post-magnetic diffusion shock region is smoothed, with even less change
occurring to the surface density and radial infall. The gas is still
somewhat slowed by the magnetic diffusion shock, but the gravity of the
central mass quickly overcomes this and pulls the fluid inwards. The
radial velocity downstream of the post-shock region is accelerated as
the fluid nears the protostar, however it remains below the free fall
velocity at all times. The mass and angular momentum both plateau in
this region before the increasing centrifugal force causes the formation
of the centrifugal shock.

The centrifugal shock occurs earlier in this similarity solution at
@xmath , which is a large increase over that in the @xmath similarity
solution. This change is brought about by the decreased values of @xmath
and @xmath in the free fall region, which reduce the amount of magnetic
braking that takes place and cause the centrifugal force to become
important earlier in the collapse. Inwards of this shock is a much wider
post-shock region of adjustment in which the variables tend towards the
inner disc solution.

The Keplerian disc in this similarity solution is substantially larger
than that in the previous solution, containing @xmath of the mass of the
central protostar. The surface density of this disc has also increased
as the magnetic diffusion parameter @xmath , while the lowered central
mass @xmath corresponds to an accretion rate of @xmath M @xmath yr
@xmath onto the central star. Again, the larger disc corresponds to a
lower accretion rate, as the reduced magnetic braking makes it more
difficult for the fluid to lose rotational support and fall inwards.

The final similarity solution presented in this chapter is that with
@xmath in Figure 5.11 , which is the most dynamically different solution
from the ambipolar diffusion solutions in Chapter 4 . Although the
initial conditions and parameters remain the same as in the previous
solutions, the change in the sign of the Hall parameter, which
corresponds to a reversal of the orientation of the initial magnetic
field with respect to the direction of rotation, introduces many changes
to the collapse dynamics.

These begin at the magnetic diffusion shock, which is located inwards of
the position for the @xmath solution in Figure 4.9 at @xmath . This
shock is of increased intensity due to the reduced radial magnetic
diffusion prior to the passage of the shock, which causes a larger
increase in @xmath in the shock front. The magnetic braking downstream
of the shock is increased by the presence of a stronger field and the
sign of the Hall term in the expression for @xmath ( 5.2 ). The disc is
more sharply compressed as the field lines straighten at the shock
front, and the fluid is so slowed by the increase in the magnetic
pressure that a second shock front forms at @xmath .

In the magnetic diffusion subshock, which was shown at higher resolution
in Figure 5.5 and described in subsection 5.2.3 , the fluid is abruptly
slowed until the radial velocity is low and subsonic. The surface
density increases under the jump conditions given in Section 5.3.3 ;
this ring of matter contains approximately 18% of the mass in the
central protostar. The azimuthal field component and the disc scale
height also increase in the subshock, while the derivative @xmath
decreases steeply. The infall region downstream of the subshock is much
wider in logarithmic similarity space than in the previous solutions,
with the increased magnetic braking reducing the angular momentum more
rapidly as the radial velocity increases under the gravitational pull of
the central mass. The surface density drops as the fluid rapidly falls
in and magnetic squeezing dominates the vertical compression until the
gravity of the central mass takes over near to the centrifugal shock.

The centrifugal shock occurs at @xmath , half that of the @xmath
solution, dramatically decreasing the size of the rotationally-supported
disc. This change is brought about by the increased magnetic braking
caused by the positive Hall term, which reduces the angular momentum so
that the centrifugal force cannot become dynamically important until the
gas is very close to the protostar. The centrifugal shock is followed by
another subshock at @xmath , which was shown in more detail in Figure
5.5 and also described in subsection 5.2.3 . Upstream of this shock the
fluid is rapidly accelerated inward as the magnetic field increases in
the very thin region between the two shocks, forcing further magnetic
braking and a rapid drop in the centrifugal force. The surface density
drops as the radial velocity becomes supersonic once more, and as the
fluid nears the protostar the centrifugal force becomes important once
more — triggering the formation of the subshock. At the subshock
discontinuity the matter is slowed until the infall rate is low and
subsonic once more.

Downstream of the subshock, the variables settle with overshoots to the
asymptotic disc behaviour. The central mass is given by @xmath , which
corresponds to an accretion rate onto the central star of @xmath M
@xmath yr @xmath , and the small Keplerian disc contains only @xmath the
mass of the central disc. The magnetic diffusion parameter in this disc
is @xmath , decreasing the surface density in the disc as the strength
of the magnetic field is increased.

The magnetic diffusion and centrifugal subshocks both occur only in
those solutions in which @xmath is positive, where the increased
magnetic pressures and braking caused by the increase in the magnetic
field falling inwards force the gas to rapidly change in radial velocity
and density. The number of subshocks downstream of the principal
centrifugal shock increases with increasing @xmath — three subshocks
have been observed in one similarity solution that was not properly
converged at the time of publication. The restriction that @xmath (see
Chapter 3 ) also limits the range of positive @xmath that can be
explored; as @xmath increases, the size and surface density of the
rotationally-supported disc decrease, and the rings of gas formed by the
subshocks are likely to be gravitationally unstable.

The inclusion of Hall diffusion into the calculations causes many
changes to the dynamics of gravitational collapse, with the sign of
@xmath introducing or suppressing the formation of subshocks downstream
of the principal shocks. The intensity and position of these shocks
change with the Hall parameter, as does the mass of the central
protostar. Additional similarity solutions with @xmath that demonstrate
these trends in more detail are presented in Appendix C .

### 5.5 Summary

Building on the work of the previous chapter, this chapter oversaw the
calculation of similarity solutions to the MHD equations for
gravitational collapse including Hall and ambipolar diffusion. Hall
diffusion introduces new subshocks and sonic points downstream of the
shocks (where the radial speed changes between being sub- and
supersonic), as seen in Figure 5.12 , requiring a more complicated
approach to finding the similarity solutions. A simplified model for
calculating the initial guess of the values of the variables at the
matching point and the model used for performing the innermost
integration were presented, as were the analytic expressions for the
initial guesses of the magnetic diffusion and centrifugal shock
positions. Finally a number of similarity solutions with initial
conditions identical to those of the first ambipolar diffusion-only
similarity solution were discussed, showing the importance of Hall
diffusion to the collapse dynamics.

The presented similarity solutions showed that Hall diffusion has a
profound effect on the complexity of the solution, depending on the
orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the rotational axis.
When the Hall parameter @xmath was negative, Hall diffusion smoothed the
post-shock regions, and the solutions matched onto the inner disc
solution with fewer overshoots. The magnetic diffusion in the radial
direction was increased, so that the magnetic diffusion shock formed
much earlier in the collapse; this shock was less strong than in the
solution without Hall diffusion with smaller changes to @xmath and
@xmath , and the post-shock slowing of the radial velocity was also
weakened. Similarly, the reduced magnetic braking caused @xmath to
attain its capped value much earlier in the collapse, causing the
centrifugal force to become dynamically important sooner and triggering
the formation of a larger rotationally-supported disc, as shown in
Figure 5.12 which demonstrates the relationship between the shock
positions and @xmath . As accretion through the Keplerian disc is slow,
larger discs tend to correlate with lower accretion rates onto the
protostar.

On the other hand, when the Hall parameter was positive the similarity
solutions were complicated by the introduction of subshocks driven by
the addition of Hall diffusion. The increased magnetic pressure caused
by the reduced radial magnetic diffusion enhanced the strength of the
principal shocks and caused them to occur much later than in the
non-Hall similarity solutions. The azimuthal magnetic field component
@xmath reached its capped value much later in the collapse process,
changing the behaviour of the angular momentum so that the size of the
innermost Keplerian disc was much reduced from that in the similarity
solution with no Hall diffusion. The smaller rotationally-supported disc
surrounded a larger protostar, as the increased magnetic braking allowed
more gas to lose its angular momentum and fall onto the protostar.

The accretion rate and the size of the rotationally-supported disc both
depend upon the Hall parameter; this relationship shall be discussed
further in the following chapter. The importance of the sign of the Hall
term with respect to the axis of rotation shall be analysed in the
context of the magnetic braking catastrophe and potential future
observations of young stellar objects.

## Chapter 6 Discussion and Conclusions

The similarity solutions have shown clearly that Hall diffusion changes
the structure and dynamics of the collapse of molecular cloud cores into
protostars and protostellar discs. The size of the
rotationally-supported disc and the accretion rate onto the protostar
are determined by the ratio of the Hall and ambipolar diffusivities,
which influences the amount of magnetic braking affecting the rotation
of the collapsing core. It is also clear that Hall diffusion can inhibit
disc formation by enhancing the magnetic braking, or by counteracting
ambipolar diffusion to the point that the field starts to infall faster
than the fluid, increasing the magnetic pressure. These behaviours
depend both upon the size of the Hall parameter and its sign (which
represents the orientation of the field with respect to the direction of
rotation and that of the Hall current).

This final chapter explores the trends that exist between the similarity
solutions in Chapters 4 and 5 , and those in Appendix C , and contrasts
these results with simulations from the literature in Section 6.1 . The
results show that there is a preferred handedness to the combination of
the magnetic field alignment, the sign of the Hall diffusivity and the
axis of rotation in disc formation calculations, which could be observed
using new instruments such as ALMA. The role of Hall diffusion in
resolving the magnetic braking catastrophe is expounded in Section 6.2 ,
and the Hall effect is shown to induce rotation in initially nonrotating
collapsing cores.

Options for future work will be outlined in Section 6.3 — these include
improving upon the limitations and assumptions of the self-similar
model; adopting alternative scalings of the Hall diffusivity @xmath as
functions of the similarity variable @xmath ; and further explorations
of the influence of Hall diffusion on the rotation of the collapsing
gas. Large regions of parameter space remain unexplored, as the
similarity solutions in this work differed only in the magnitude of the
Hall parameter, while keeping the initial angular momentum, density and
ambipolar diffusion parameters constant. Several directions for further
explorations of parameter space are considered, as well as alternate
methods for modelling the vertical angular momentum transport, which was
here limited by the cap on the azimuthal field. Finally, a summary of
the results and their astrophysical implications are discussed in
Section 6.4 .

### 6.1 Star Formation and the Hall Effect

The dependence of the similarity solutions upon the orientation of the
magnetic field and the sign of the Hall diffusion parameter @xmath (more
specifically upon the sign of @xmath , although in this work only the
sign of the Hall diffusion parameter is altered) gives rise to two
different patterns of collapse behaviours. Three similarity solutions,
with @xmath , @xmath (originally plotted in nondimensional form in
Figures 4.9 , 5.11 and 5.9 respectively) are converted to dimensional
form and plotted against the radius @xmath (at a time @xmath years) in
Figure 6.1 , with the surface density @xmath plotted in the upper panel
and the vertical magnetic field strength plotted as @xmath in the lower.
The three curves in each panel have the same outer boundary conditions
and parameters (listed in Table 5.3 ), and the surface density and
vertical field strength (at @xmath AU), as well as the central mass, and
the mass and size of the inner disc (all at @xmath years) of the
solutions are listed in Table 6.1 . The outer regions of the collapse
are near-identical, as the collapse is dominated by IMHD (so that
diffusion is not important) and it is only near the magnetic diffusion
shock at @xmath AU that the changes brought on by Hall diffusion become
apparent.

The dotted blue lines in Figure 6.1 , corresponding to the negative Hall
solution in Figure 5.9 , show the formation of a large
rotationally-supported disc that has a radius @xmath AU at @xmath years,
and the highest inner Keplerian disc surface density of all the
solutions. The dashed black lines are the @xmath ambipolar
diffusion-only solution from Figure 4.9 , which possesses a disc half
the size of the negative Hall solution. The surface density of the
Keplerian disc in this solution is decreased from that in the negative
Hall solution by a constant factor as the accretion rate increases (this
change in @xmath is discussed below). Finally, the solid red curves
characterise the similarity solution with a positive Hall parameter
@xmath (illustrated in Figure 5.11 ) which has a Keplerian disc that is
almost an order of magnitude smaller than that in the equivalent
negative Hall case. This disc is bounded by a thin ring of enhanced
density, which rapidly drops off as the magnetic field peaks; the
material is then shocked again and comes to match onto the inner
solution. The density in this smaller disc is much lower than in the
previous solutions, and the disc grows at a much slower rate.

The similarity solutions span many orders of magnitude in both radius
and density, and the inclusion of a Hall parameter that is only 20% that
of the ambipolar diffusion parameter has a large effect on the behaviour
of the magnetic field. In the radial direction, the drift of the field
lines with respect to the fluid takes place with velocity

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the intermediate region between the magnetic diffusion shock (at
@xmath AU in Figure 6.1 ) and the centrifugal shock ( @xmath AU), when
@xmath is negative, the azimuthal field tension causes the Hall drift to
enhance the radial diffusion of the field lines. This torque creates a
radial force on the infalling neutral particles that slows the infall
speed. The magnetic diffusion shock occurs earlier in the collapse and
is less dynamic, that is, there is less of an increase in @xmath than in
the other solutions, as much of the field has already been decoupled
from the fluid.

However, when @xmath is positive then Hall diffusion acts to reduce the
net radial diffusion, resulting in magnetic walls and subshocks that
disrupt the flow. The magnetic field carried in towards the protostar
increases, and the magnetic pressure and tension terms remain important
throughout the collapse. Any twist in the field lines causes an increase
in the magnetic pressure gradient, so that the net amount of radial
diffusion drops off as the magnetic braking slows the rotation by
twisting the field above the pseudodisc.

There is a similar duality to the azimuthal field drift, which occurs
with a drift velocity as defined in Equation 2.83 :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Again looking at the intermediate regions between the two shocks, when
@xmath is negative the bracketed terms, which are proportional to the
vertically integrated component of the current density, cause the Hall
drift in the azimuthal direction, which twists up the field lines in the
pseudodisc and creates a leading torque on the neutral rotation. The
reduced value of @xmath in this region causes the azimuthal field
component to reach its capped value @xmath sooner in the collapse, and
the magnetic braking, which depends upon @xmath , is also reduced.
Because of this, less angular momentum is removed from the pseudodisc,
causing the centrifugal force to become dynamically important earlier
and a larger rotationally-supported disc to form.

In the other orientation, that is, when @xmath is positive, Hall and
ambipolar diffusion act together to untwist the field lines in the
pseudodisc. In these similarity solutions @xmath is larger, and so while
it takes longer for @xmath to achieve its capped value there is more
total magnetic braking and the angular momentum is further reduced. A
smaller Keplerian disc forms due to the reduced centrifugal force, and
both shocks have subshocks where the magnetic forces alter the radial
velocity of the fluid. Downstream of the magnetic diffusion shock the
radial magnetic pressure gradient causes the fluid to be slowed in the
radial and azimuthal directions, while downstream of the centrifugal
shock the gas is accelerated inward as the increase in @xmath causes a
burst of magnetic braking that disrupts the disc and causes the
formation of a subshock.

While the angular momentum behaviour between the magnetic diffusion and
centrifugal shocks is changed by the inclusion of Hall diffusion, the
cap on @xmath acts to ensure that the angular momentum in the inner disc
is that expected for a Keplerian disc. The cap, while physically
motivated, replaces unspecified disc physics such as reconnection, a
disc wind, or turbulence, which would act to prevent the azimuthal field
component from greatly exceeding the vertical component; the magnitude
at which it ought to act to limit @xmath is uncertain. It is also
unclear if such limiting of the azimuthal field component happens in
real collapsing cores, and the numerical simulations illustrating disc
formation that are discussed in the next section do demonstrate
tightly-wound magnetic fields (e.g. Machida et al., 2008a ) . The
azimuthal field cap limits the similarity solution set explored in the
previous chapter to those in which discs form, however despite this Hall
diffusion has been shown to restrict disc formation if the Hall
diffusion is too strong in comparison to ambipolar diffusion and @xmath
has the “wrong” sign.

It is in the region between the magnetic diffusion and centrifugal
shocks that the influence of Hall diffusion on the field behaviour
becomes more obvious in this comparison. In the negative Hall solution
this region is characterised by a steady increase in @xmath with
decreasing @xmath , while the surface density gradually varies,
decreasing near both shocks where the radial velocity is high. In the
ambipolar diffusion-only solution the peak in @xmath interior to the
magnetic diffusion shock is sharpened, and causes a subtle change in the
slope of @xmath . The positive Hall solution sees the peak in the
surface density become so strong that a subshock forms interior to the
magnetic diffusion shock. This subshock is a sharp increase in the
surface density and a marked change in the gradient of the magnetic
field. The region between the two shocks is extended as the gas is
slowed by the subshock, and the rate of magnetic braking in this
solution has been increased by the Hall diffusion, which acts to
increase @xmath .

As shown in Figure 6.1 , there exists a clear relationship between the
Hall diffusion parameter and the radius of the centrifugal shock. This
is further demonstrated in Figure 6.2 , which plots the shock position
for similarity solutions with initial parameters equal to those in Table
5.3 (at a time @xmath years) against the ratio of the Hall to ambipolar
diffusion parameters. The centrifugal shock marks the edge of the
Keplerian disc, and it clearly decreases in radius as the ratio of
diffusion parameters increases; this behaviour was noted in the analytic
estimation of the shock position derived in Section 5.3 . While both
directions of Hall drift contribute to the change in the size of the
disc, the radial drift of @xmath , which increases when the Hall
parameter is negative (see Equation 6.1 ), has a greater effect on the
radius of the centrifugal shock than the torque caused by the azimuthal
Hall drift.

The constant velocity of the shocks in Figure 6.1 is given by @xmath ,
where the nondimensional shock positions @xmath are those listed in
Table B.2 for these values of @xmath , and @xmath km s @xmath is the
isothermal sound speed. All of the solutions form a protostar of around
@xmath solar masses and a protostellar disc of radius @xmath 10– @xmath
AU and mass @xmath – @xmath M @xmath in @xmath years; these are the same
order of magnitude expected from observations of Class I YSOs (e.g.
Jørgensen et al., 2007 ) .

The solutions compared in Figure 6.1 , and those in Appendix C , have
surface densities @xmath and @xmath in the inner Keplerian disc, with a
value @xmath AU, @xmath years @xmath g cm @xmath ; the exact value of
@xmath at this point for each of these solutions are given in Table 6.1
. These values of the surface density are consistent with what is
thought to have occurred in the solar nebula (e.g. the minimum mass
solar nebula has @xmath g cm @xmath at @xmath AU; Weidenschilling, 1977
) . Although the scaling of the surface density with radius appears to
be imposed upon the disc by the simple model used to integrate to the
inner boundary (see Section 5.2 ), the surface density tends
asymptotically towards this behaviour before the simple model is
activated. The parameter space explored was chosen to correspond to such
disc-forming similarity solutions; variations in the model parameters
(particularly the cap on the azimuthal field @xmath ) could cause the
disc surface density to behave differently, however no other
disc-forming asymptotic solutions to the collapse equations were found
in Chapter 3 .

With increasing @xmath the increasing number of subshocks force the
calculations to become so unstable that they cannot converge on the true
similarity solution, which makes it difficult to speak of trends within
the solution space. However, for the other polarity (where @xmath is
negative) the solutions tend towards the behaviour exhibited in the slow
IMHD collapse solutions discussed in Section 4.2 ; this trend can be
seen across the similarity solutions in Appendix C . The region between
the magnetic diffusion and centrifugal shocks becomes smaller as the
magnetic pressure gradient becomes less important to the infall rate. As
@xmath becomes increasingly large and negative, Hall diffusion continues
to be important to the azimuthal field diffusion and the magnetic
braking, controlling the amount of angular momentum in the inner regions
of the collapse and determining the size of the Keplerian disc.

The value of @xmath in the Keplerian disc depends quite sensitively on
the Hall parameter @xmath , even though the vertical field component
@xmath increases only very slightly with increasing @xmath . As the
magnetic field is decoupled from the fluid there is a corresponding
increase in the magnetic force, which slows down the inflow and reduces
the inflow rate (see Equation 3.45 ). The inflow rate decreases with
decreasing @xmath and @xmath , and the decrease in radial velocity
corresponds to an increase in the disc surface density. The amount of
radial field diffusion determines the accretion rate @xmath , as well as
the disc surface density; this behaviour was noted by Contopoulos et al.
( 1998 ) for their ambipolar diffusion solutions without rotation.

The vertical magnetic field behaves the same (and has very similar
magnitudes) in all three similarity solutions in Figure 6.1 on the inner
Keplerian disc; this is merely an artefact of the choice of illustrated
solutions, as the additional Hall similarity solutions in Appendix C
show that the vertical field in the disc drops off with increasingly
large negative Hall parameter. The accretion onto the central protostar
depends upon the magnetic tension so that @xmath and @xmath are tied
with @xmath , and as Table 6.1 shows, there is little change in either
of @xmath or @xmath across these three solutions. Similarly, in the
outer regions of the disc where there is very little magnetic field
diffusion and IMHD generally holds true, the vertical field magnitude is
the same across all three solutions.

There also exists a correlation between the accretion rate onto the
central protostar and the ratio of the Hall to ambipolar diffusion
parameters, as can be seen in Figure 6.3 . The behaviour of the
accretion rate depends upon the disc radius, with larger discs
corresponding to lower accretion rates and vice versa; this behaviour
was also noted by Allen et al. ( 2003a ) . The infall rate through the
Keplerian disc depends upon the radial diffusion of field lines (see
Section 3.2 ), with larger negative Hall parameters causing an increased
drag on the neutrals and a reduction of the radial velocity of the
neutral fluid. The disc radius (and by extension the accretion rate)
depends also upon the initial rotational velocity of the molecular cloud
core, as the centrifugal force becomes important sooner and a larger
disc forms when there is more initial angular momentum; this
relationship was demonstrated in Chapter 4 for the similarity solutions
without Hall diffusion.

The accretion rate onto the central protostar appears to turn over at
around @xmath M @xmath yr @xmath once the ratio of the nondimensional
Hall to ambipolar diffusion parameters becomes positive and greater than
0.05. This is likely due to the introduction of the subshocks in the
solutions with @xmath positive. In the subshocks the density is
enhanced, as is @xmath , and so the accretion rate drops and less matter
can be accreted onto the central mass. As the positive Hall parameter is
increased, further subshocks are introduced into the solutions, which
cause there to be an even lower inflow rate; and as @xmath tends towards
the value that would see the diffusion parameter

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

become @xmath , @xmath in the disc also tends towards 0 (see Section 3.2
). The surface density and the accretion rate through the disc depend
upon @xmath because the accretion is regulated by the magnetic diffusion
and associated torques, and this parameter places constraints on the
possible values of @xmath that exist in rotationally supported discs.

Clearly, the diffusion parameter of the disc, @xmath , cannot be
negative or equal to zero, as this implies that the field moves inward
faster than the neutral particles; this causes an increase in the
magnetic forces that would inhibit further collapse and disc formation.
Disc formation is also inhibited when @xmath is too large and @xmath is
positive, as again @xmath would tend towards 0, constraining the
azimuthal field twisting in a rotationally-supported disc. Similar
constraints on the launching of disc winds were found by Salmeron et al.
( 2011 ) , who showed that self-consistent disc wind solutions only
exist for particular combinations of the field polarity and the ratio of
the Hall to ambipolar diffusion parameters.

It has recently been argued that there exists a handedness to
observations of transverse gradients in the Faraday rotation measure
across the base of jets associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN;
Contopoulos et al., 2009 ) . The majority of sources in which it was
possible to determine the transverse gradients were found to have
clockwise gradients, which imply that the outflow has a helical magnetic
field with a preferred positive magnetic polarity (i.e. that @xmath is
parallel to the rotation vector). One explanation of this behaviour is
that the Hall effect is important in the inner accretion disc, acting to
cause the formation of a jet when the field has a positive magnetic
polarity, and to suppress jet formation when the polarity is negative
(Königl, 2010 ) . This explanation fits the limited available data well,
although it can only be confirmed by future observations at higher
resolutions and sensitivities, which will illuminate the properties of
the dense molecular gas in the accretion discs of AGNs and show whether
the Hall current is important to the jet formation.

Similarly, it may be possible to show observationally the importance of
the sign of the Hall parameter in determining the properties of
protostars and their discs. Measuring the polarisation of the magnetic
field with respect to the axis of rotation using Zeeman observations of
newly-forming stars and their discs would provide a means of testing
whether Hall diffusion plays an important role in star formation —
should larger discs and lower accretion rates be correlated in
observations with a particular field orientation then the Hall effect
will have been shown to be important to the collapse process. ALMA
(among other next-generation instruments) shall be capable of imaging
nearby dense prestellar cores and their envelopes in both dust and
molecular line emission, and also use polarised dust emission to map the
magnetic field configuration in such cores (ESO, 2001 ) . Such
observations could be sensitive enough to observe if there is any
difference in the field alignment between protostellar discs and their
envelopes, and whether there is any correlation between disc size and
the direction of rotation in the disc.

None of the solutions calculated in this work explored the effects of
very weak magnetic diffusion and strong magnetic braking on the core,
where the angular momentum of the collapsing flow is expected to be so
reduced that near to the protostar the fluid is nonrotating (or rotating
very slowly). This behaviour, and its predictions for star and
protostellar disc formation are discussed in the following section.

### 6.2 The Magnetic Braking Catastrophe

In gravitational collapse models with magnetic fields two problems
arise. The first occurs in nonrotating collapse simulations where the
mass-to-flux ratio is constant and there is no mechanism for preventing
the magnetic field from falling in, so that as the mass of the protostar
builds up so too does its field. This results in the formation of a star
with a very large (by many orders of magnitude in comparison to
observations) magnetic field, and is referred to as the classical
“magnetic flux problem” of star formation, which was described by
Chandrasekhar and Fermi ( 1953 ) and outlined in Section 1.5 . This is
resolved by the inclusion of magnetic diffusion, which allows the field
to drift against the flow of the infalling fluid.

However, there also exists a secondary problem tying the magnetic flux
problem and the angular momentum problem (described in Section 1.4 )
together, in which strong magnetic braking removes all of the angular
momentum from the collapse, preventing the formation of a
rotationally-supported disc. This behaviour, dubbed the “magnetic
braking catastrophe”, affects many recent numerical collapse simulations
(see e.g. Allen et al., 2003a ; Mellon and Li, 2008 , 2009 ; Hennebelle
and Ciardi, 2009 ) , whereas observations of young stars show that
protostellar discs are common (e.g. Jørgensen et al., 2007 ) .

The cap placed upon the magnitude of @xmath restricted the amount of
magnetic braking in the solutions presented in the previous chapters and
is perhaps the greatest limitation of the semianalytic model constructed
in this work. While it is reasonable to assume that physical processes
other than those included in the self-similar equations will restrict
the growth of the azimuthal field, the fact that @xmath is capped for
almost all of the solutions interior to the magnetic diffusion shock
suggests that the results are sensitive to this prescription. Were the
cap to be lifted, stronger magnetic braking could remove all of the
angular momentum from the infalling gas, preventing disc formation.

In their semianalytic solutions to gravitational collapse with ambipolar
diffusion Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) found solutions in which disc
formation was inhibited by the magnetic braking. These “strong braking”
solutions were found by raising the azimuthal field cap, @xmath , and
the magnetic braking parameter, @xmath (where @xmath is the ratio of the
sound speed @xmath to the external Alfvén speed @xmath , defined in
Equation 2.84 ), so that the magnetic braking reduces the centrifugal
force until it is incapable of supporting the gas against collapse. The
high value of the azimuthal field cap ( @xmath ) allows the magnetic
field to become tightly wrapped around the rotational axis (this has
also been seen in numerical simulations such as Machida et al., 2008a )
, however this wrapping may not be possible in real cores.

This behaviour was illustrated in figure 10 of Krasnopolsky and Königl (
2002 ) , reproduced here in Figure 6.4 , which is characterised by
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath , with the rest of the parameters as listed
in Table 5.3 . In the outer region of the core the collapse follows that
for the similarity solutions with capped braking in Figure 4.9 , as IMHD
is dominant. However, as the field is decoupled from the neutrals the
magnetic braking rapidly starts to reduce the angular momentum. The
magnetic diffusion shock at @xmath sees an increase in the vertical
magnetic field component that accelerates the magnetic braking further,
and the angular momentum of the infalling material drops to a small
nonzero value @xmath which depends upon the ambipolar diffusion
parameter and the initial rotation rate. In this ambipolar diffusion
solution the neutral component must be rotating relative to the charged
component of the fluid in order to feel the magnetic braking torque;
this causes the formation of a plateau from which the angular momentum
cannot be reduced further. As there is no rotational support the fluid
falls in with a radial velocity @xmath close to the free fall velocity,
and no disc forms.

Such “strong braking” solutions were not duplicated in this work,
however it is clear that if the magnetic braking parameter and the
azimuthal field cap are raised then the similarity solutions with Hall
diffusion will display similar behaviour to that in Figure 6.4 . The
inner asymptotic behaviour of the solutions would follow that outlined
by Equations 3.64 – 3.73 in Section 3.3 for the supersonic
magnetically-diluted free fall onto the central protostar. No
rotationally-supported disc would form, clearly demonstrating the
magnetic braking catastrophe.

The contrast in behaviour between the ambipolar diffusion solutions of
Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) demonstrating disc formation and those
of Mellon and Li ( 2009 ) illustrating the magnetic braking catastrophe
is discussed in the following subsection.

#### 6.2.1 Case study: ambipolar diffusion collapse

The similarity solution calculated in Chapter 4 for the ambipolar
diffusion-only collapse (reproducing the fiducial result of Krasnopolsky
and Königl, 2002 ) used a cap on the azimuthal field component to limit
the magnetic braking and ensure disc formation. This is in direct
contrast with the numerical simulations of Mellon and Li ( 2009 ) , who
were unable to observe disc formation in their simulations of collapsing
cores with ambipolar diffusion unless the cosmic ray ionisation rate was
unreasonably low or the magnetic field was particularly weak. To explore
the discrepancy in disc forming behaviour between the two models, the
velocity profiles of both the standard solution of Mellon and Li ( 2009
, figure 3) and the fiducial solution of Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002
) at a time @xmath s ( @xmath years) are shown in Figures 6.6 and 6.6
respectively.

The sharp decrease in the infall velocity in Figure 6.6 at @xmath cm
marks the boundary of the Keplerian disc in the similarity solution,
interior to which the rotational velocity increases further. No such
deceleration of the infall velocity occurs in Figure 6.6 , where the
uncapped magnetic braking prevents disc formation on this scale by
removing all rotational support from the collapsing core. Both plots
demonstrate similar infall velocity behaviour in the region of the
magnetic diffusion shock at @xmath cm, while the rotation velocity is
always quite different between the two solutions. Near the inner
boundary of Figure 6.6 the rotation velocity does start to increase,
however this is sufficiently far from the Keplerian value that any disc
would have to form inside the inner boundary of the calculations. While
it is most likely the cap on the magnetic braking in the similarity
solution of Figure 6.6 that is responsible for the difference in
disc-forming behaviour, there are other discrepancies between the two
models that explain why one is able to form discs and the other cannot.

The simulations of Mellon and Li ( 2009 ) were an extension of their
previous work on the collapse of molecular cloud cores under IMHD
(Mellon and Li, 2008 ) , which was modified to include ambipolar
diffusion of the magnetic field. A spherical coordinate system under the
assumption of axisymmetry was adopted, and the computational grid
extended from @xmath to @xmath cm in @xmath , and from @xmath to @xmath
in @xmath . The resolution of the solution was characterised by 120 grid
points in the radial direction and 60 angular points; these grid points
were logarithmically spaced in radius. The collapse solutions were not
fully isothermal; a broken power law equation of state was used to
describe the behaviour of the fluid so that the gas was isothermal below
@xmath g cm @xmath and adiabatic with @xmath above.

The outer boundary of the collapse simulations of Mellon and Li ( 2009 )
was taken to be the standard “outflow” condition that was implemented as
a feature of the ZeusMP MHD code in Hayes et al. ( 2006 ) . The inner
boundary was a modified outflow condition, with the mass accreted across
the boundary added to the central point mass and a torque-free condition
imposed upon the magnetic field (that @xmath ). The initial conditions
of the core were idealised as a rotating self-similar isothermal toroid
supported against gravity partially by thermal pressure and partially by
the magnetic field at the moment of point mass formation. These initial
conditions are compared in Table 6.2 to those used for the fiducial
solution of Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) (reproduced in Section 4.3
as Figure 4.9 ).

There are two major discrepancies between the initial conditions and
collapse parameters between the two models: the first is the infall rate
at the outer boundary @xmath , and the second is the nondimensional
ambipolar diffusion parameter @xmath , which changes by more than an
order of magnitude between the models. The initial velocity at the outer
boundary was found to have no qualitative effect on the simulations of
collapse with IMHD by Mellon and Li ( 2008 ) ; this is used to justify
their choice of no initial infall rate as the outer boundary condition
in this model. However, the ambipolar diffusion parameter is key to the
disc formation behaviour of the two models and this large variation
between the two models, in addition to the capped magnetic braking, is
more than enough to explain the differences between them.

Although both models cite the same cosmic ray ionisation rate (see Table
6.2 ), there is an order of magnitude difference between the ambipolar
diffusion parameters adopted by each model. This occurs because
Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) chose an anomalously large value of
@xmath to use in their fiducial solution. In exploring the applicability
of the assumption that @xmath is a constant in their model, Krasnopolsky
and Königl ( 2002 ) stated that @xmath in the outer regions of the
collapse where the density is typically between @xmath and @xmath cm
@xmath , and @xmath in the inner regions where the density lies between
@xmath and @xmath cm @xmath . These values are clearly much closer to
the value used by Mellon and Li ( 2009 ) in their standard model, and
indeed when Mellon and Li ( 2009 ) dropped their ionisation rate to
@xmath s @xmath (corresponding to @xmath ) their collapse model was able
to form a centrifugal disc around the protostar.

In Section 4.3 , it was shown that the position of the centrifugal shock
depends quite clearly upon the ambipolar diffusion parameter.
Substituting the fiducial model parameters of Mellon and Li ( 2009 )
into Equation 4.180 gives an estimate of the shock position at the time
@xmath s that is many orders of magnitude smaller than the inner
boundary of the collapse (due to the exponential in the equation).
Although it is a poor approximation to the shock position in this region
of parameter space, Equation 4.180 suggests that no
rotationally-supported disc larger than the inner boundary of Figure 6.6
( @xmath cm) will form unless @xmath . Earlier in this section it was
demonstrated that a large decrease in the ambipolar diffusion parameter
such as that between the two solutions, coupled with the corresponding
increase in the rate of magnetic braking, prevented disc formation in
the similarity solutions of Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) , as the
magnetic braking catastrophe also inhibited disc formation in their
similarity solution with @xmath (shown in Figure 6.4 ).

The fiducial similarity solution of Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) in
Figure 6.6 also possessed a higher initial rotation velocity than the
simulation of Mellon and Li ( 2009 ) in Figure 6.6 , and it was shown in
Chapter 4 that the value of @xmath directly affects the size of the
rotationally-supported disc, with larger discs corresponding to larger
initial rotational velocities. Contrasting the two simulations, as well
as the strong braking solutions of Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) in
Figure 6.4 , shows that the cap on @xmath is most likely responsible for
the differences in the magnetic braking behaviour.

Further exploration of parameter space, particularly in matching the
parameters used in numerical and self-similar models, is needed to
explore whether adopting realistic values and scalings of the ambipolar
and Hall diffusion parameters will resolve the magnetic braking problem.
In the following subsection several mechanisms for reducing the magnetic
braking in the collapsing flow and their expected results shall be
discussed.

#### 6.2.2 Proposed Solutions

Keplerian discs form in those simulations in which there is enough
angular momentum that the centrifugal force is able to support the fluid
against collapse. The magnetic braking catastrophe occurs because the
twisting of the field lines caused by the rotation of the fluid in the
disc transports angular momentum from the core to the envelope, slowing
the rotation and inhibiting disc formation. This can be seen in the
results of Sections 4.1 and 4.2 , where the introduction of ideal MHD to
the previously nonmagnetic collapse saw magnetic braking reduce the size
of the rotationally-supported disc, and prevents disc formation entirely
in both the IMHD strong braking similarity solution in figure 6 of
Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) and many numerical simulations (see
e.g. Allen et al., 2003a ; Galli et al., 2006 ; Mellon and Li, 2008 )

Various approaches to solving the magnetic braking catastrophe have been
adopted with different degrees of success. It is possible to reduce the
magnetic braking by changing the alignment of the magnetic field with
respect to the rotational axis, limiting the twisting of the field
within the core or the amount of angular momentum that can be accepted
by the envelope and employing magnetic diffusion to change the coupling
between the magnetic field and the fluid. Magnetic diffusion reduces the
amount of braking by allowing the field lines at the midplane to slip
against the neutrals rather than rotating with them around the core.

The amount of magnetic braking affecting the core depends upon the
product @xmath , and so any change in the alignment of the field with
respect to the axis of rotation shall influence the magnetic braking
behaviour. Mouschovias and Paleologou ( 1980 ) showed that the magnetic
braking affecting a disc of fixed height was more efficient when the
magnetic field and the axis of rotation were perpendicular. The
rotational waves in their discussion propagated perpendicular to the
axis of rotation, affecting matter in the external medium with
increasing moments of inertia as the moment of inertia of the core
itself decreased, and this lead to a higher magnetic braking efficiency.

Hennebelle and Ciardi ( 2009 ) found that the opposite was true. In
their three-dimensional simulations including IMHD the height of the
pseudodisc and inner Keplerian disc increases with the angle of
alignment between the field and the rotational axis as the magnetic
field lines are twisted about an axis parallel to the plane of the
pseudodisc. The rotation of the core itself also impedes contraction
along the magnetic field lines, further increasing the scale height of
the core. This increase in scale height causes a reduction in the
magnetic braking as the braking time is shorter, so that larger
Keplerian discs form when the angle between the rotation and magnetic
field axes is 90 @xmath .

This conclusion was supported by the results of Ciardi and Hennebelle (
2010 ) , which showed that the angle between the rotation and magnetic
field axes also influences the formation of outflows and jets, and can
suppress these when the axes are perpendicular. Any misalignment causes
the jets to precess, which further reduces the efficiency of the
magnetic torque in removing angular momentum from the pseudodisc and
allows a larger Keplerian disc to form when the angle is perpendicular.

Other mechanisms for limiting the magnetic braking in the collapsing
core and enabling disc formation include capping the azimuthal field and
insisting that the core possess a finite boundary, as disc formation is
clearly enabled by limiting the degree of magnetic braking in the
collapsing core. In Krasnopolsky and Königl ( 2002 ) and this thesis it
was assumed that the external envelope of the core was effectively
infinite and that the magnetic field lines were anchored into this
external medium. This meant that the magnetic braking could transfer as
much angular momentum from the core as the cap on @xmath allowed, which
(as shown in Figure 6.4 ) could inhibit disc formation when the braking
was sufficiently strong. However, this limitation is unrealistic, as the
forming protostar is expected to accrete or dissipate the envelope, and
the cap on @xmath is itself merely a way of representing unknown disc
physics that needs to be better understood, which should be replaced in
future work on the subject (discussed further in Section 6.3 ).

Simulations of the collapse of a core in a finite host cloud under IMHD
(Galli et al., 2006 ) and resistive MHD (Machida et al., 2007 , 2011 )
were able to form Keplerian discs, as the magnetic braking became less
effective as the core envelope was depleted. In these simulations the
early phase of collapse was characterised by slow circumstellar disc
growth regulated by magnetic braking; in the later stages the envelope
is depleted by accretion onto the pseudodisc, so that magnetic braking
is no longer effective and a large disc is able to form. Limiting the
amount of material that can accept the angular momentum from the core
clearly allows a rotationally-supported disc to form, and so the
boundary conditions of numerical simulations must be carefully
considered in light of the magnetic braking catastrophe.

Magnetic field diffusion is also important to resolving the magnetic
braking catastrophe, as less magnetic braking occurs in a pseudodisc
that has less magnetic flux. In calculations where the Ohmic resistivity
is taken to be spatially-constant, such as those by Shu et al. ( 2006 )
and Krasnopolsky et al. ( 2010 ) , the Ohmic diffusivity required to
allow disc formation must be anomalously large. Krasnopolsky et al. (
2010 ) in particular required an Ohmic resistivity three orders of
magnitude larger than that expected in molecular cloud cores and many
numerical reconnection events in order to form a rotationally-supported
disc that was @xmath AU during the Class 0 stage of star formation. In
reality the importance of Ohmic dissipation is expected to vary with
density (see Figure 1.3 ) in the inner regions of the core; by taking it
to be spatially-constant across the collapsing core a higher value is
required in order to avoid the magnetic braking catastrophe.

When the Ohmic diffusivity is not spatially-constant, and instead varies
with the density of the neutrals, it is able to prevent the removal of
all the angular momentum from the core. Machida et al. ( 2011 ) found
that their simulations with Ohmic dissipation formed
rotationally-supported discs with radii @xmath AU at @xmath yr (where
@xmath is the time after disc formation) as the decoupling of the field
from the charged particles in the innermost regions of the collapse
halted the magnetic braking in these regions. Dapp and Basu ( 2010 ) ,
following on from Machida et al. ( 2007 ) , demonstrated that a
canonical amount of Ohmic dissipation was able to reduce the amount of
braking in the first (adiabatic) core so that a centrifugal disc formed
in their axisymmetric numerical calculations. The Ohmic resistivity
adopted in their calculations (and in those of Machida et al., 2011 )
depended upon the density in the core and never greatly exceeded that
expected from ionisation calculations such as those by Wardle and Ng (
1999 ) .

Reducing the inner field strength by ambipolar diffusion allows larger
discs to form than in IMHD simulations with equivalent initial
conditions and parameters (demonstrated in Section 4.3 ), however, this
required the use of a cap on @xmath . Without this cap, ambipolar
diffusion is unable to completely resolve the magnetic braking
catastrophe (e.g. Figure 6.4 ; Krasnopolsky and Königl, 2002 ; Mellon
and Li, 2009 ) . The simulations of Mellon and Li ( 2009 ) demonstrating
the magnetic braking catastrophe were discussed in detail in the
previous subsection, however these showed a possible resolution of the
catastrophe by reducing the cosmic ray ionisation rate (increasing the
ambipolar diffusion parameter) in the core. ( Kunz and Mouschovias (
2010 ) were able to form disc-like structures in their simulations in
which the field was decoupled from all species by ambipolar diffusion
before Ohmic dissipation became important, however their solutions were
nonrotating and so no Keplerian disc could form.)

The results of the semianalytic model presented in this work showed that
the Hall effect also plays a critical role in determining the amount of
magnetic braking that affects the collapsing flow. It is difficult to
include Hall diffusion in numerical simulations, due to the small time
steps required to trace it accurately, however some work is being done
in this area (see Krasnopolsky et al., 2011 ) . The size of the
rotationally-supported disc that formed in the solutions presented in
the previous chapter depends upon the direction of the magnetic field,
and varied by almost an order of magnitude between the solutions with
@xmath and @xmath . As will be discussed further in subsection 6.2.3 ,
Hall diffusion can increase the magnetic braking affecting the core or
instead act in the opposite direction to increase the amount of rotation
in the disc, despite the cap that has been placed upon @xmath .

Although much of the focus of this thesis has been on the magnetic
braking caused by Hall and ambipolar diffusion, it is also the case that
in weakly ionised cores with no initial rotation the Hall effect can
induce rotation via magnetic acceleration . Some preliminary work has
been performed to calculate such similarity solutions; in subsection
6.2.3 it shall be shown that Hall diffusion could induce disc formation
in an initially nonrotating core.

#### 6.2.3 Hall-driven spin-up of collapsing cores

In Wardle and Ng ( 1999 ) it was suggested that the Hall current in a
collapsing molecular cloud core would cause @xmath to grow and force the
fluid to pick up a toroidal component of momentum, which could
contribute to the gravitational support of the core. Krasnopolsky et al.
( 2011 ) have recently published the results of a three-dimensional
simulation of the collapse of an initially nonrotating core under the
influence of Hall diffusion, showing that the Hall effect causes the
collapsing material to spin-up. They demonstrated that azimuthal torques
powered by the Hall effect twist the ions and by extension the neutral
particles (as the magnetic field is anchored in the external medium) as
expected; conservation of momentum implies then that the gas and
envelope will both spin-up in opposite directions, which was observed in
their simulation.

The full model code from Chapter 5 has been employed here to similarly
demonstrate such Hall spin-up of an initially nonrotating molecular
cloud core. This model has yet to converge on the true similarity
solution, as the shock-finding routine outlined in Section 5.2 does not
converge properly in these calculations without modification. The
variables in the outer regions and those downstream of the magnetic
diffusion shock before the gravity of the central mass dominates the
radial velocity of the fluid are quite trustworthy, while the inner
regions of the calculations are unreliable representations of the core
behaviour.

Figure 6.7 shows this non-converged solution to the outer boundary
conditions, which (as in Figure 4.6 ) fails on the inward integration
interior to the magnetic diffusion shock. This calculation has
nondimensional Hall parameter @xmath and ambipolar diffusion parameter
@xmath (matching those in Figure C.5 ), which were chosen to demonstrate
the spin-up behaviour caused by the Hall effect, even when @xmath is
small, is enough that a rotationally-supported disc could form in the
fully converged solution. The solution satisfies the outer boundary
conditions for the parameters listed in Table 5.3 , save for the initial
rotational velocity which is taken to be @xmath in the initially
nonrotating core. The central mass is estimated by the plateau value
@xmath defined in Equation 4.42 .

In the outermost regions of Figure 6.7 the material undergoes near-ideal
MHD collapse; the small divergences from flux-freezing cause the angular
momentum of the gas to rapidly increase from zero at the outer boundary
@xmath (which is outside the domain of the figure) to a plateau value
determined by the Hall diffusion parameter. The value of this plateau is
estimated from the conservation of angular momentum equation ( 2.107 ),
in the limit where @xmath is constant and given by the plateau values
@xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the large @xmath limit the infall velocity is small compared to
@xmath so that @xmath , and the other variables are given by the outer
asymptotic power law relations defined in Section 2.7 . These relations
are substituted into Equation 6.4 , which is rearranged to give the
expression

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

The azimuthal field component @xmath in this region is determined by
both the Hall diffusion and the vertical compression of the disc, which
in turn depend upon the self-gravity of the pseudo disc and the magnetic
squeezing caused by @xmath . The vertical hydrostatic equilibrium
equation ( 2.108 ) is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

in the limit of large @xmath , both @xmath and @xmath are inversely
proportional to @xmath and as such their product may be dropped from the
equation. Similarly the azimuthal field component is small in comparison
to the poloidal components, so that Equation 6.6 may be simplified into

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

which becomes

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

upon substitution of the outer boundary flux-freezing condition for the
radial field component. Physically, in the outermost regions of the core
the scale height is dominated by tidal compression and magnetic
squeezing associated with the radial field component @xmath .

As the azimuthal field component and angular momentum are small when
@xmath is large, Equation 2.114 may then be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

The total field magnitude may be approximated by @xmath as the azimuthal
component is small. The outer asymptotic relations (Equations 2.128 –
2.130 ) are then substituted into Equation 6.9 , so that @xmath may then
be approximated by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is then substituted into Equation 6.5 to give an estimate of the
angular momentum plateau,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

The value of the angular momentum plateau and the near-constant ratio of
the azimuthal to vertical field components in the plateau region for the
non-converged similarity solution in Figure 6.7 and a second calculation
in which @xmath (which is also matched to the outer boundary only) are
compared to the theoretical estimations from Equations 6.10 – 6.11 in
Table 6.3 . The estimated values match the calculated ones very well,
with @xmath matching to @xmath and @xmath to @xmath , demonstrating that
the physics of the region is well accounted for by the approximations.
All of the angular momentum in the core, and the twisting of the field
lines is caused by the Hall effect, as the radial component of the
magnetic pressure gradient causes azimuthal drift of the field lines,
which in turn creates the torque that spins up the ions and neutrals.
The value of the specific angular momentum plateaus once the induced
rotation is rapid enough that the magnetic torque is balanced by the
rotational torque. As the density of the gas is quite limited in the
outer regions, the Hall spin-up of the disc is limited until the
variables start to diverge from their asymptotic behaviour and IMHD
breaks down.

The behaviour of the fluid downstream of the magnetic diffusion shock at
@xmath (which is close to the value @xmath estimated by multiplying
Equation 5.46 by the factor 0.83; see Section 5.3 ) is less clear, as
the solution has not yet converged and the position of the centrifugal
shock is only approximately known. As in the initially rotating
solutions in Chapter 5 , the fluid is slowed at the shock, until the
gravity of the central mass starts to dominate the radial velocity and
the fluid is accelerated inwards once more. Hall diffusion quickly spins
up the gas in the post-shock region, until again it reaches a plateau
which is similar in value to that experienced in the rotating solution
in Figure C.5 . Near the region where the centrifugal force becomes
important, the azimuthal component of the magnetic field @xmath reaches
its capped value, and the angular velocity is quite close to that
expected from Keplerian rotation (depicted as the solid red line in the
lower panel of Figure 6.7 ).

Much remains to be done on this model to ensure that the similarity
solution converges to the true solution and matches the expected
asymptotic behaviour on both boundaries of the collapse. The spin-up
behaviour can clearly only exist when there is Hall diffusion of the
magnetic field, as when @xmath there is no mechanism for inducing
rotation in an initially nonrotating core and neither the angular
momentum or the azimuthal field component can acquire a nonzero value.
Although disc formation has yet to be observed, the solution in Figure
6.7 shows that the rotational velocity of the collapsing material
reaches the rotationally-supported value of @xmath near the point where
the code breaks down, suggesting that disc formation may be enabled by
the Hall effect in the collapsing gas, supporting the numerical results
of Krasnopolsky et al. ( 2011 ) .

The direction of rotation within the collapsing flow is determined by
the sign of @xmath . The spin in the outer regions of the core, given by
Equation 6.11 , shows this; and as the field increases the magnetic
acceleration causes the gas to spin-up further in this direction. While
this solution is clearly a special case, such spin-up behaviour caused
by the Hall effect could in fact resolve the magnetic braking
catastrophe. Hall diffusion causes a rotational torque on the gas that
can enhance or reduce the magnetic braking that removes angular momentum
from the disc and it does not stop acting once all of the angular
momentum reaches zero — indeed, it could act at this point to start
spinning the fluid back up in the opposite direction to the initial
rotation of the core. This may produce enough angular momentum to form a
Keplerian disc, in complete defiance of the expected behaviour from
non-Hall solutions in which there is no way to increase the rotational
energy of the flow.

The magnetic braking catastrophe prevents the formation of
rotationally-supported discs around protostars by the removal of angular
momentum from the collapsing flow, in contrast with observations that
show protostellar discs are common. This causes the collapse downstream
of the magnetic diffusion shock to occur in near-free fall, limited only
by the magnetic pressure, which is insufficient to prevent collapse,
particularly when the field is allowed to diffuse outward against the
fluid. Various approaches have been adopted to solve this problem,
including limiting the magnetic braking by placing a cap upon @xmath and
introducing Ohmic diffusion, which decouples the field from the fluid
and limits the effectiveness of magnetic braking in the inner regions.

Hall diffusion is capable of inducing spin in an initially nonrotating
core, and could resolve the magnetic braking catastrophe by further
inducing spin in the opposite direction once magnetic braking has
removed the initial angular momentum from the core. Further work must be
done to study the role of the Hall effect on the magnetic field
diffusion in star formation, particularly using the semianalytic model
constructed in this thesis, and possible directions for further study of
Hall diffusion in collapse are discussed in the following section.

### 6.3 Future Work

Much still needs to be done both with the self-similar model of
gravitational collapse as presented in this thesis and with the model
modified by improved assumptions about such physics as the vertical
angular momentum transport and the way in which the Hall diffusion
parameter scales with the density in the collapsing flow. This section
shall explore some of the work that is already underway and the
directions yet to be examined in future studies of magnetized
gravitational collapse.

#### 6.3.1 Limitations and assumptions

The self-similar model is quite limited in that it is effectively only
two dimensional with much of the physics simplified so as to produce a
self-similar semianalytic solution of infinite resolution to the
equations of gravitational collapse, with azimuthal and vertical effects
in the disc sacrificed for ease of calculation. Numerical solutions can
trace the behaviour of the collapse until the density of the inner
regions becomes so high compared to the resolution in space, and the
time step required to trace the fluid so short as to make further
integration possible (although the application of a sink particle at the
centre of the collapse can allow some further calculation). It is also
the case that some numerical models do not possess the resolution
necessary to see the formation of rotationally-supported discs of
equivalent size to those that form within the self-similar model at a
given system age. However, numerical simulations are able to include
nonaxisymmetric and vertical effects, which allow them to better explore
the magnetic braking catastrophe and outflows.

The assumptions of isothermality, axisymmetry and that the magnetic
field and axis of rotation are aligned are all required to ensure the
self-similarity of collapse, and cannot be lifted. Isothermality keeps
the sound speed in the fluid constant, and although it breaks down in
the late stages of collapse when @xmath cm @xmath (Gaustad, 1963 ) this
only occurs in the innermost regions of the rotationally-supported disc
in the similarity solutions. The only other place in the solutions where
isothermality is likely to break down is in the magnetic diffusion
shock, however the magnetic pressure is more than an order of magnitude
larger than the gas pressure in the shock front and this is not likely
to greatly affect the nature of the collapse. Axisymmetry, which reduces
the dimensionality of the problem, causes the suppression of disc
physics such as turbulence and gravitational instabilities; these could
potentially be included in the model using a scaled prescription, but it
is not clear that any such prescription would add meaningfully to the
physics in the core. Hennebelle and Ciardi ( 2009 ) showed that varying
the angle between the magnetic field and the axis of rotation affected
the efficiency of disc formation, however such behaviour is fully
three-dimensional and could never be included in self-similar collapse
models.

The assumptions that @xmath and @xmath can be approximated by monopoles
is another that could be improved upon with more careful calculation.
Adding an additional cycle of computation to the convergence routine
that would find these terms more precisely (as in Contopoulos et al.,
1998 ) would slow the calculation of similarity solutions down further;
however, this could be offset by some parallelization of the full code
which is made possible by recent increases in the computing power and
number of processors on individual CPUs. Such calculations would improve
the accuracy of the determination of the radial gravitational and
magnetic field components, although it is not clear that these
approximations need to be replaced.

The thin disc assumption made it possible to adopt linear scalings of
the radial and azimuthal field components with height in the disc and
average the other parameters with respect to the disc scale height to
produce a set of equations that depended only upon @xmath and @xmath .
This averaging prevents the examination of any behaviours that occur
within the thin disc, such as the MRI and other turbulent effects, that
may be important to the angular momentum transport. The @xmath
-viscosity of Shakura and Sunyaev ( 1973 ) provides an axisymmetric
average of turbulence within the disc, which can be scaled with the
self-similar variables and could in future be included in the model. The
thin disc assumption also allows terms of order @xmath to be dropped
from the equation set, on the grounds that they are usually small.
Reintroducing these terms would allow the structure of the collapsing
flow to be refined without adding very much to the computation costs. It
is not clear what changes (if any) these small terms would bring to the
self-similar model of collapse.

The transportation of angular momentum in the vertical direction is
perhaps the most limiting of the simplifications adopted in the model.
Several mechanisms for better calculating the behaviour of the azimuthal
field and the angular momentum transport are outlined in the following
subsection.

#### 6.3.2 Vertical angular momentum transport

The azimuthal field in this model was limited by an artificial cap that
was specifically designed to replace physics missing from the rest of
the model. Based on the assumption that @xmath is the dominant component
of the field, it is unclear what the magnitude and applicability of this
cap ought to be. For the purpose of properly solving the magnetic
braking catastrophe, different ways of replacing or calculating this cap
need to be determined.

The assumption of axisymmetry precludes the addition of
magnetohydrodynamic instabilities such as internal kinks and turbulence
to the self-similar model; such behaviour would prevent @xmath from
greatly exceeding the poloidal field components. These effects could
potentially be parameterised according to the way in which they scale
with the field strength, the density and other variables in numerical
solutions, and then included into the self-similar model as a mechanism
for constraining @xmath .

In the inner Keplerian disc @xmath , which is the launching condition
for a cold, centrifugally-driven wind, and the radial scaling of the
magnetic field components is identical to that of the
radially-self-similar wind solution of Blandford and Payne ( 1982 ) .
Such a disc wind, which was described in appendix C of Krasnopolsky and
Königl ( 2002 ) , would be the dominant mechanism for the transfer of
angular momentum from the disc to the envelope. A disc wind must be
included in future self-similar collapse simulations in order to explore
the influence a wind may have on the angular momentum transport, the
magnetic braking catastrophe and furthermore to simply improve the
accuracy of the models, as disc winds and jets are known to occur in
numerical simulations (e.g Tomisaka, 2002 ; Machida et al., 2007 ;
Mellon and Li, 2009 ; Ciardi and Hennebelle, 2010 ) of collapsing
protostellar discs.

#### 6.3.3 Scaling the magnetic diffusivities

For an idealised fluid with no grains, the Hall and ambipolar
diffusivities are given in dimensional form by

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.12)
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.13)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the neutral density fraction (which tends towards @xmath
in weakly ionised fluids such as are found in molecular clouds cores;
Cowling, 1957 ; Wardle, 1999 ; Pandey and Wardle, 2008 ) . In their
numerical solutions Krasnopolsky et al. ( 2011 ) used a spatially
constant coefficient @xmath for the Hall diffusivity, so that the
behaviour of the Hall effect was not directly dependent upon the density
of the disc. The Hall term spins up the inner part of the collapsing
flow to Keplerian speeds, with the direction of the field determining
the direction of the Hall-induced magnetic torque, and
rotationally-supported disc formation was found to be possible in their
calculations only when @xmath cm @xmath s @xmath G @xmath .

The self-similarised Hall diffusivity @xmath from the full set of fluid
equations solved in this work was taken to scale with the surface
density and scale height of the disc as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath was a constant. The decision to employ this scaling was a
pragmatic one, as the Hall diffusion then becomes important with the
ambipolar diffusion (which also scaled as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

in self-similar space), and the drift of both grains and ions are
important to the collapse. The ratio of the diffusion parameters was
then critical to all discussions of the similarity solutions, and by
keeping the ambipolar diffusion coefficient constant it was possible to
explore the individual influence of the Hall term. In general though,
both diffusion parameters could scale as any function of the similarity
variable @xmath and the fluid variables without breaking
self-similarity.

For example, a second choice for scaling the Hall parameter that could
be adopted in future is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

which would be the behaviour expected if

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

that is, if the only important particles in the collapsing core are
neutrals and ions, without grains. This change would see the Hall
diffusion become important earlier in the collapse, as the density
increases and would also change the degree of magnetic braking. Such a
formulation would also change the behaviour in the inner Keplerian disc,
and a new set of asymptotic inner boundary conditions describing this
disc behaviour would need to be derived.

There is considerable scope for examining similarity solutions where the
relationship between the two diffusivities changes with @xmath , so that
each may become important at different points in the collapse process.
This is the case in reality; Figure 1.3 showed that Hall diffusion is
expected to become important when the density and the magnetic field are
both of intermediate strength, while ambipolar diffusion is dominant
where the density is low and the field strength high, and these could be
better reflected in the collapse solutions. The diffusivities may be
made to scale with any function of the self-similar variables and @xmath
, in order to mimic the behaviour expected from ionisation equilibrium
calculations, and these scalings could include changing the sign as well
as the magnitude of the Hall diffusivity with increasing density.

#### 6.3.4 Exploring parameter space

The Hall similarity solutions presented in Chapter 5 explored only a
very narrow region of parameter space where the outer boundary
conditions and the magnetic parameters were held constant as the Hall
diffusion parameter was varied in both directions. The similarity
solutions without Hall diffusion from Chapter 4 and Section 6.2 showed
that reducing the initial rotational velocity of the core altered the
size of the Keplerian disc; that raising the azimuthal field cap and the
magnetic braking parameter caused all of the angular momentum to be
removed from the core so that no disc formed; and that reducing the
ambipolar diffusion parameter caused the size of the
rotationally-supported disc and the accretion rate onto the protostar to
be reduced further. Future work on the Hall similarity solutions must
reproduce this diversity of parameter space, in order to better
understand the importance of Hall diffusion on the collapse process.

Perhaps the most interesting region of parameter space to explore is
that in which Hall diffusion is the dominant form of flux transport.
Without changing the magnetic braking parameter and the cap on @xmath ,
it is only possible to find similarity solutions in which
rotationally-supported discs form when the Hall diffusion parameter is
negative and large (see Section 6.1 and Equation 6.3 ). If Hall
diffusion were dominant, it would further change the overall structure
of the collapse, as it appears in the equations for determining both the
rotational velocity of the collapsing gas as well as the magnetic
support in the flow. In reality Hall diffusion is not necessarily
expected to exceed ambipolar diffusion except in the innermost regions
of the collapse (Wardle, 2004a , 2007 ) , but this presents an
interesting goal for theoretical calculations as such similarity
solutions would further demonstrate the importance of the Hall effect on
the collapse.

Further to this, it would be of interest to calculate solutions without
ambipolar diffusion at all, in which all of the magnetic field diffusion
is performed by the Hall diffusion term, as in Krasnopolsky et al. (
2011 ) . Hall diffusion would change the nature of the collapse, as all
of the field diffusion would then depend upon the @xmath terms, so the
radial field diffusion depends on the azimuthal field component (which
may be capped) as opposed to the whole of the field, and the azimuthal
diffusion depends upon the radial component. Such similarity solutions
would again be not strictly realistic, however in the regions of the
collapse interior to the magnetic diffusion shock (which would likely
occur later in the collapse due to the absence of ambipolar diffusion)
the density and field strength are both of intermediate value and Hall
diffusion could already be more important than ambipolar diffusion (see
Section 1.2 ).

As mentioned in the previous section, more needs to be done to explore
the importance of the magnetic braking parameter @xmath and the cap on
the azimuthal field component @xmath . Should these be increased it
seems likely that the increased magnetic braking will remove all angular
momentum from the collapse and the solutions will tend towards the
asymptotic free fall collapse described in Section 3.3 . In that inner
asymptotic solution Hall diffusion changes the field strength in the
disc, while the surface density and radial velocity depend only upon the
central mass. Such similarity solutions would provide further insight
into the magnetic braking catastrophe and should be determined in future
work on this topic.

In Chapter 4 it was shown that the initial rotational velocity plays an
important role in determining the size of the Keplerian disc in those
solutions without Hall diffusion. Further work should be done to confirm
that larger discs form if the core is initially rapidly-rotating in the
similarity solutions with Hall diffusion. Although the Hall effect does
change the behaviour of the magnetic braking in the disc, it is not
expected to make any dramatic changes to the collapse behaviour
otherwise as the initial angular momentum is varied. The orientation of
the field, and in consequence the strength of the magnetic braking,
could influence the effect of the initial rotational velocity of the
molecular cloud core on the centrifugal shock position; obviously work
must be done to properly explore this concept.

### 6.4 Conclusions

This thesis described a semianalytic self-similar model of the
gravitational collapse of rotating magnetic molecular cloud cores with
both Hall and ambipolar diffusion, presenting similarity solutions that
showed that the Hall effect has a profound influence on the dynamics of
collapse. The solutions satisfied the vertically-averaged self-similar
equations for MHD collapse under the assumptions of axisymmetry and
isothermality, matching onto the self-similar power law relations
describing an isothermal core at the moment of point mass formation on
the outer boundary and a Keplerian disc on the inner boundary.

Two power law similarity solutions were derived that satisfy the
collapse equations on the inner boundary. The first of these represents
a Keplerian disc in which accretion through the disc depends upon the
magnetic diffusion; with an appropriate value of the nondimensional Hall
diffusion parameter @xmath a stable rotationally-supported disc forms in
which the surface density @xmath scales as @xmath and vertical field
strength @xmath . These are the scalings expected from other simulations
of protostellar discs to which the solutions calculated in this work
compare favourably. No disc may form when the Hall parameter is large
(in comparison to the ambipolar diffusion parameter) and has the wrong
sign (which indicates the orientation of the magnetic field with respect
to the axis of rotation), as the diffusion in these solutions is too
strong and causes disruptive torques that form subshocks in the full
similarity solutions. This seemingly-odd behaviour occurs because the
response of the fluid to Hall diffusion is not invariant under a global
reversal of the magnetic field.

The second power law similarity solution describes the behaviour of the
infall when the magnetic braking is efficient at removing angular
momentum from the flow and no rotationally-supported disc forms. The
matter falls rapidly onto the central protostar and what little angular
momentum remains is that induced by the Hall effect; the direction of
rotation depends upon the sign of the Hall parameter. This behaviour is
indicative of the “magnetic braking catastrophe” that occurs in many
magnetic collapse simulations.

The size of the rotationally-supported disc in the full similarity
solutions was shown to vary with the amount of Hall and ambipolar
diffusion affecting the pseudodisc through their effect on the magnetic
braking in the fluid. By creating an additional torque on the disc, Hall
diffusion can either increase or decrease the angular momentum and
rotational support in the infalling fluid, leading to an order of
magnitude change in the Keplerian disc radius between the similarity
solutions at the extremes of @xmath (where the ambipolar diffusion
parameter, @xmath ). A small amount of Hall diffusion was shown have a
large effect on the solution because the dynamic range of collapse is
itself many orders of magnitude in space and time. Hall diffusion causes
there to be a preferred handedness to the field alignment and the
direction of rotation in forming a large Keplerian disc that could be
observed using next-generation instruments such as ALMA.

The accretion rate onto the central point mass is similarly influenced
by the inclusion of Hall diffusion. This is a smaller effect than that
on the disc radius, as between @xmath (again with @xmath ) the accretion
rate onto the protostar only changes by 6%, or @xmath M @xmath yr @xmath
. There exists a clear trend in which the accretion rate drops off with
increasingly negative Hall parameters, as the reduced magnetic braking
in these solutions causes a larger Keplerian disc to form through which
accretion onto the protostar is slow.

It has also been shown that Hall diffusion can induce rotation in an
initially nonrotating molecular cloud core, as the azimuthal torques
twist the field lines, spinning up the core and envelope in opposite
directions. The direction of spin in the core is determined by the sign
of the Hall parameter; changing the sign of @xmath reverses the
direction of rotation and shall also affect the size of the disc as in
the solutions where the initial rotation is nonzero. As the density and
flux rise the field decouples from the neutrals, and the azimuthal Hall
diffusion causes the angular momentum to increase to the point where the
centrifugal force roughly matches the gravitational force, suggesting
that it is possible to form a centrifugal disc around the protostar.

The magnetic braking catastrophe could be resolved by the inclusion of
Hall diffusion in numerical solutions, as with one sign of @xmath the
Hall effect acts to reduce the total amount of braking affecting the
core, preventing it from removing too much angular momentum from the
collapse. However, with the other sign of @xmath the magnetic braking is
increased so that more angular momentum is transported to the envelope.
As magnetic braking due to Hall diffusion does not stop acting once no
angular momentum remains (as ambipolar diffusion does) it could also
then spin-up the collapsing fluid back up in the opposite direction to
the initial rotation. This acceleration is only possible with Hall
diffusion, and it has the potential to completely resolve the magnetic
braking catastrophe.

Because of its tendency to pull the gas in unusual directions Hall
diffusion is usually overlooked in simulations of gravitational collapse
and star formation. It has been shown that the Hall effect is important
to the dynamics of the collapse, particularly the magnetic braking
behaviour which determines the existence and size of the
rotationally-supported protostellar disc. The handedness of the response
of the collapse to the inclusion of the Hall effect has obvious
dynamical and potentially observable consequences for the gravitational
collapse of molecular cloud cores, which must be studied more closely if
the dynamics of the star formation process and the variations observed
across YSOs and their discs are to be properly understood.
