This diploma thesis is concerned with functional decomposition @xmath of
polynomials. First an algorithm is described which computes
decompositions in polynomial time. This algorithm was originally
proposed by Zippel (1991). A bound for the number of minimal collisions
is derived. Finally a proof of a conjecture in von zur Gathen,
Giesbrecht & Ziegler (2010) is given, which states a classification for
a special class of decomposable polynomials.
