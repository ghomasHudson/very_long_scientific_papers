In this thesis massive higher derivative gravity theories are analyzed
in some detail. One-particle scattering amplitude between two
covariantly conserved sources mediated by a graviton exchange is found
at tree-level in @xmath dimensional (Anti)-de Sitter and flat spacetimes
for the most general quadratic curvature theory augmented with the
Pauli-Fierz mass term. From the amplitude expression, the Newtonian
potential energies are calculated for various cases. Also, from this
amplitude and the propagator structure, a three dimensional unitary
theory is identified. In the second part of the thesis, the found three
dimensional unitary theory is studied in more detail from a canonical
point of view. The general higher order action is written in terms of
gauge-invariant functions both in flat and de Sitter backgrounds. The
analysis is extended by adding static sources, spinning masses and the
gravitational Chern-Simons term separately to the theory in the case of
flat spacetime. For all cases the microscopic spectrum and the masses
are found. In the discussion of curved spacetime, the masses are found
in the relativistic and non-relativistic limits. In the Appendix, some
useful calculations that are frequently used in the bulk of the thesis
are given.
