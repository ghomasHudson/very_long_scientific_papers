This thesis addresses the problem of providing trusted individuals with
confidential information about other individuals, in particular,
granting access to databases of personal records using the World–Wide
Web. It proposes an access rights management system for distributed
databases which aims to create and implement organisation structures
based on the wishes of the owners and of demands of the users of the
databases. The dissertation describes how current software components
could be used to implement this system; it re–examines the theory of
collective choice to develop mechanisms for generating hierarchies of
authorities; it analyses organisational processes for stability and
develops a means of measuring the similarity of their hierarchies.
