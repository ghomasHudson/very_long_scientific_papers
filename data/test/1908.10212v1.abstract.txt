In finite graphs, finite-order tangles offer an abstract description of
highly connected substructures. In infinite graphs, infinite-order
tangles compactify the graphs in the same way the ends compactify
connected locally finite graphs. Thus, the arising tangle
compactification extends the well-known Freudenthal compactification
from connected locally finite graphs to arbitrary infinite graphs. This
Masterâ€™s thesis investigates the tangle compactifcation.
