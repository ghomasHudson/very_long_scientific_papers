This thesis describes the development of some basic mathematical tools
of wide relevance to mathematical physics. Transmission and reflection
coefficients are associated with quantum tunneling phenomena, while
Bogoliubov coefficients are associated with the mathematically related
problem of excitations of a parametric oscillator. While many
approximation techniques for these quantities are known, very little is
known about rigorous upper and lower bounds.

In this thesis four separate problems relating to rigorous bounds on
transmission, reflection and Bogoliubov coefficients are considered,
divided into four separate themes:

-   Bounding the Bogoliubov coefficients;

-   Bounding the greybody factors for Schwarzschild black holes;

-   Transformation probabilities and the Miller–Good transformation;

-   Analytic bounds on transmission probabilities.
