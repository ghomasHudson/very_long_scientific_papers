In the thesis we analize different problems related to the
supersymmetric extension of the Dirac-Born-Infeld action. In chapter 2
we introduce the DBI action and show how it appears in string theory, we
discuss also it’s connection with Dp-branes. Chapter 3 is a self
contained introduction to supersymmetry, with emphasis on BPS states. In
chapter 4 we construct the @xmath supersymmetric extension of the
Born-Infeld-Higgs in three space-time dimensions and discuss it’s BPS
states and Bogomol’nyi bounds. In chapter 5 we construct the @xmath
supersymmetric extension of the non-abelian Born-Infeld theory in four
space-time dimensions. Chapter 6 deals with the analisis of BPS and
non-BPS solutions of the Dirac-Born-Infeld action and their
interpretation in superstring theory. Chapter 7 is devoted to the
conclusions. Three appendix complete the work.
