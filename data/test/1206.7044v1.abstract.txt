In [ 1 ] a two-Higgs-doublet model with maximal symmetry under
generalised CP transformations, the MCPM, has been proposed. The theory
features a unique fermion mass spectrum which, although not describing
nature precisely, provides a good approximation. It also predicts the
existence of five Higgs bosons with a particular signature.

In this thesis I implemented the MCPM into the Monte-Carlo event
generation package MadGraph, allowing the simulation of any MCPM
tree-level process. The generated events are in a standardised format
and can be used for further analysis with tools such as PYTHIA or GEANT,
eventually leading to the comparison with experimental data and the
exclusion or discovery of the theory. The implementation was
successfully validated in different ways. It was then used for a first
comparison of the MCPM signal events with the SM background and previous
searches for new physics, hinting that the data expected at the LHC in
the next years might provide exclusion limits or show signatures of this
model.
