This thesis discusses the worldsheet geometries in the @xmath minimal
model coupled to 2D euclidean Quantum Gravity with particular focus on
non-compact geometries. We first calculate the FZZT-FZZT cylinder
amplitudes for all pairs of Cardy matter states thereby generalizing the
result obtained in arXiv:hep-th/0406030 and discuss the decompositions
of the cylinder amplitudes in terms of solutions to the homogeneous
Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We then show, that the principal ZZ boundary
conditions in Liouville theory can be viewed as effective boundary
conditions obtained by integrating out the matter degrees of freedom on
the worldsheet. We now consider the @xmath minimal model coupled to 2D
euclidean Quantum Gravity obtained in the scaling limit of dynamical
triangulations, in which the @xmath multi-critical hyper-surface is
approached and the conformal background is turned on. We show, that only
one concrete realization of matter boundary condition, the @xmath Cardy
boundary condition, is obtained in this scaling limit. Finally, we study
the cylinder amplitude with fixed distance and provide some evidence of
a transition from a FZZT-brane to a ZZ-brane on the exit loop in the
limit, where the distance approaches infinity, and for particular values
of the exit-boundary cosmological constant.
