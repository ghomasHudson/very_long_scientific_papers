## Introduction

The Sun is undoubtedly the most important astronomical object for
the human kind. Although its proximity and the fact that it has been
largely studied, our knowledge is yet quite poor in understanding how it
really works: which are the mechanisms that rule its behaviour, with the
eleven years solar cycle, and further more facts concerning the magnetic
nature and its implications in the structure of our closest star.

The study of the Sun embraces nowadays multiple branches: from the study
of the solar interior through helioseismology techniques up to the study
of the solar wind that impacts the Earth after traveling a long distance
across the emptied space. The majority of advances in solar physics have
come thanks to the new telescopes and observational techniques. The
quality of the images taken by telescopes has improved considerably in
the last decades and nowadays it has almost reached the diffraction
limit imposed by the instrument. Computational tools have also taken
part in the development of solar physics by improving modelling and
simulations which are in their turn corroborated by observations, hereby
the importance of reaching high-resolution observing levels.

The Sun evolves and changes in different time and spatial scales. Added
to the 11 years cycle that marks the biggest changes in the solar
magnetic field structure, it also presents more rapid changes that can
be seen from Earth. Appearance of sunspots, for instance, was first
observed in the XVII century with the use of the telescope in astronomy
though there were many records of sunspots observations since antiquity.

The aim of this thesis associated to the Imaging Magnetograph eXperiment
(IMaX) project developed by several Spanish institutions ¹ ¹ 1 Instituto
de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC), Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía
(IAA), Instituto Nacional de Técnica Aeroespacial (INTA), Grupo
Astronomía y Ciencias del Espacio (GACE) has two main branches. Firstly,
the initial part of the thesis deals with instrumental aspects,
reviewing the latest restoration techniques and concerning the design of
a method to calibrate the in-flight instrumental aberrations of IMaX.
The second part of the thesis is dedicated to the study of the dynamics
of structures in the solar photosphere, in particular in solar active
regions. A more detailed information of the contents for each chapter is
described below:

In Chapter § 1 we start reviewing the theory concerning the image
formation which is crucial to understand many concepts developed through
all the thesis, such as the degradation of images and the restoration
techniques applied to reconstruct them.

Chapter § 2 is devoted to the instrument IMaX, describing first the
project it is associated to, the objectives of the mission and some
important characteristics about it. Moreover, the main concern of this
section is the definition of the method for the IMaX in-flight
calibration and the subsequent test of the robustness of the method
taking into account all possible error sources.

Chapter § 3 is the first chapter within the second part of the thesis.
It introduces the theory on solar active regions and the current
knowledge in the field, i.e. the description of the structures
conforming a solar active region, ranging from the widely studied umbra
and penumbra of sunspots to the more recently discovered fine
structures.

In Chapter § 4 we employ the restoration techniques to correct solar
data and show the first results yield by the study of horizontal proper
motions in and around sunspots. Maps of horizontal velocities are
presented for a complex solar active region with a @xmath
-configuration. Some of the results in this chapter have already been
published in the The Astrophysical Journal Letters (ApJL) .

Chapter § 5 extends the study of proper motions to a larger sample of
sunspots displaying various penumbral configurations. Most of the
results presented in this chapter have already been published in the The
Astrophysical Journal (ApJ) .

Chapter § 6 extends the study of solar active regions done in the
previous two chapters by analyzing a sample of solar pores from
ground-based and space observations. This chapter is a extended version
of the work to be published in the The Astrophysical Journal (ApJ) .

Chapter § 7 summarizes the conclusions of the work and the final
discussion.

## Part I Defining a method for in-flight calibration of IMaX
aberrations

### Chapter 1 Foundations on image restoration \dropping

[0pt]2In the first part of this thesis I concentrate on the techniques
we employ to achieve high-resolution solar images that enable us to
study the Sun at very small spatial scales (fine details).

#### 1.1 Introduction

Current problems trying to explain the physics of the Sun require to
resolve very tiny structures as the first step to be able to model what
is actually happening in different layers and regions in the Sun.

The Earth’s atmosphere can be considered as an isotropic turbulent
medium. The quality of the solar images captured by ground-based
telescopes is severely affected by the atmospheric turbulence. The image
degradation is generally described as the combination of three main
contributions, as follows:

-    Structures smearing ( blurring ).

-    Global displacements of the image ( image motion ).

-    Distortion of the structures caused by the differential image
    motion of different patches in the FOV ( stretching ).

All these degradation effects considered together are usually referred
to with the term seeing and represent the first problem to face if we
are interested in high resolution data.

There have been recent efforts trying to circumvent the atmospheric
influence on the observed images. Space-based telescopes ( Domingo,
Fleck & Poland , 1995 , SOHO) are undoubtedly the obvious best choice to
get rid of the atmospheric effects. We all have got fascinated with the
images obtained by space facilities and nowadays we are still getting
astonishing data from them (HINODE; Kosugi et al. , 2007 ) . But the
elevated cost of construction and operation of these space solar
telescopes has made the scientific community to think about an
alternative.

In recent years and in order to improve the ground-based observations,
the Adaptive Optics (AO Rimmele , 2000 ; Scharmer et al. , 2000 ) has
made possible to partially correct both, the instrumental and the
atmospheric aberrations. The idea is conceptually simple and uses
optical elements deforming in real-time to compensate the wavefront
aberration induced by the atmosphere and the telescope.

Due to the temporal scale in the evolution of the seeing, the AO only
pursues low-order corrections that moreover are limited to an
isoplanatic patch of a few arc seconds, so that it is compulsory to
implement post-facto computational techniques to complement the
real-time corrections. Powerful numerical codes for image restoration
have been thus developed in the last decade, every single one requiring
an especially designed observing strategy.

In order to quantify how the aberrations affect the images, it is worth
to dedicate the next section to the mathematical formalism describing
the image formation in the telescope.

#### 1.2 Image formation

The basic process describing the formation of images is shown in Figure
1.1 a. The object of study is placed on the so-called object plane
represented by the coordinates system ( @xmath ), and another coordinate
system ( @xmath ) called the image plane is situated right in the focal
plane of the telescope. The wave coming from a point source in the
object plane passes through the atmosphere and part of it enters the
telescope and forms the corresponding image (not a point anymore but a
spot) centered at position ( @xmath ) in the image plane.

If the object source is the impulse unit function its image corresponds
to the impulse response function of the optical transmission system
(atmosphere + telescope). This response is also named Point Spread
Function (PSF) of the system. The PSF can be viewed as the normalized
distribution of intensity in the image of a point source and can be
expressed as @xmath , where @xmath represent the variability of the
transmission system (e.g. atmospheric turbulence evolves at a fast rate)
and ( @xmath ) reflects that the PSF is, in general, space variant,
i.e. the distribution of intensity in the image of a point source
changes with its location ( @xmath ) in the object plane. Note that (
@xmath ) is the image conjugated point of ( @xmath ).

Considering an extended object like the Sun as composed by multitude of
incoherent point sources, with individual intensities @xmath , we can
estimate the resulting intensity distribution in the focal plane of the
telescope. Assuming a linear optical system and incoherent illumination,
this intensity can be expressed as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath represents the distribution of intensity in the ideal image
(i.e. also in the object) that would produce a perfect system free from
aberrations and with infinite aperture. The intensity at each point
@xmath of the image has a contribution from the images centered at
points in the neighbourhood, e.g. @xmath in Figure 1.1 b .

For an isoplanatic system having a spatially invariant PSF, i.e.
@xmath , the equation 1.1 can be written as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (1.2)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

where @xmath stands for convolution and is the vectorial notation for
the coordinates in the image points. Using the convolution theorem ¹ ¹ 1
The convolution theorem states that the Fourier transform of the
convolution of two functions is the product of their respective Fourier
transforms. , the intensity can be expressed in the Fourier domain as
the product

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where capital letters stand for the Fourier transforms of the functions
in lowercase, is the frequency vector in the Fourier domain and, @xmath
is the so-called Optical Transfer Function (OTF) of the system. The
amplitude of the OTF is defined as the Modulation Transfer Function
(MTF): @xmath . According to equation 1.3 the MTF is a filter that
attenuates the amplitudes of the Fourier components of the ideal image
to form the observed image.

#### 1.3 Image restoration as a particular case of the Inverse Problem
in Physics

Image restoration fits into the format of the Inverse Problem in Physics
² ² 2 The inverse problem frequently occurs in different branches of
science where the values of some model parameters must be obtained from
the observed data. which, in general, can be considered to as the
solution @xmath of the Fredholm inhomogeneous integral equation of the
@xmath kind

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is known as the kernel of the integral equation. Equation
1.2 is a particular case of equation 1.4 , where the kernel is the PSF.

The inverse problem in our particular case is usually called image
reconstruction or image restoration since the target is to achieve an
estimate of the ideal image or equivalently of the true object starting
from a degraded image . Because in our particular case the inverse
problem can be formulated as a convolution equation (eq. 1.2 ), image
restoration can also be referred to as a deconvolution problem , the
formal solution of which can be expressed from equation 1.3 as follows,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

or in the measuring domain as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

The symbol @xmath over @xmath means that the restoration will not be
complete in any case since the transmission system operates as a
low-pass spatial frequency filter with a given cut-off. In other words,
the restoration problem will render an estimate of the true object .

In order to compute @xmath it is mandatory to characterize the PSF (or
its Fourier transform the OTF) describing the optical system. Several
approaches to the PSF determination lead to different numerical methods
for the restoration of solar images ( Bonet , 1999 ) .

##### 1.3.1 Noise contribution

An additional difficulty in the inversion problem arises from the fact
that in the real case, the observed image is affected by noise caused by
different sources being the readout and the photon noise the more
relevant components. Though the latter is proportional to the square
root of the number of photons in the incoming signal, in most solar
physics applications the assumption of uncorrelated signal and noise
gives good results. In this manner, equation 1.2 can be completed
including the noise as and additive contribution, and reformulated as ³
³ 3 Note that the variable t is dropped from the formulae describing the
image formation in order to shorten the notation. However, one has to
keep in mind that the formulae describe instantaneous events.

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

and in the Fourier transformed domain

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

The restoration based in formula 1.5 leads to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the term @xmath represents a noise amplification, making
compulsory to pursue a noise filtering, previous to the restoration
process.

##### 1.3.2 Noise filtering

Filtering of the noisy signal is standardly done by using the so-called
optimum filter @xmath , described for 1D problems by Brault & White (
1971 ) , which is a real function that weights the diverse Fourier
spectral components according to the noise level at each frequency.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

The optimum filter is formulated as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

Combining the noise filtering together with the deconvolution, we
eventually find the optimum filter for restoration @xmath , better known
as the Wiener-Helstrom filter ⁴ ⁴ 4 Named after the optimal estimation
theory of Norman Wiener, this filter simply acts separating signals
based on their frequency spectra. The gain of the filter at each
frequency is determined by the OTF of the system and the relative amount
of signal and noise at that frequency.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

where SNR @xmath is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Since we do not
know a priori the function @xmath , some models for SNR @xmath are
commonly assumed ( Collados , 1986 ) . Hereafter the superscript @xmath
stands for complex conjugate.

#### 1.4 The Phase Diversity Technique for image restoration

The Phase Diversity (PD) technique was first proposed by Gonsalves &
Childlaw ( 1979 ) as a new method to infer phase aberrations working
with images of extended incoherent objects formed through an optical
system. This technique of image reconstruction (see also Gonsalves ,
1982 ; Paxman et al. , 1992 ) requires to use at least two images of the
object we want to reconstruct. One of the images is the conventional one
degraded by an unknown aberration (atmosphere and telescope) and the
second one is a strictly simultaneous image of the same object affected
by the same unknown aberration plus a known intentionally induced
aberration. Figure 1.2 shows an optical setup where we induce a known
amount of defocus by displacing backwards the camera with respect to the
nominal focus.

The system of equations that mathematically describes the formation of
both images can be expressed as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

where :
@xmath is the focus-defocus image pair. @xmath are the corresponding
PSF’s for both channels. @xmath are the noise additive terms. @xmath is
the so-called true object .

If we do not consider the noise terms the system above is determined
since it has two equations and two unknowns: @xmath and @xmath . Note
that @xmath and @xmath differ in a well-known defocus value and
consequently are analytically related.

Nevertheless, the noise terms force a statistical solution of the
problem. Paxman et al. ( 1992 ) propose a least squares solution for the
system of equations. For Gaussian noise, they derived the following
error metric in the Fourier domain to be minimized

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

where capital letters stand for the Fourier transforms of the functions
in lowercase in the system of equations 1.13 , @xmath is introduced by
Löfdahl & Scharmer ( 1994 ) as a weighting factor to equalize the noise
contributions for the case when the noise variances @xmath and @xmath
are not the same in both images. @xmath represents the OTF of the system
which can be derived as the auto-correlation of the so-called
generalized pupil function @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath stand for the working wavelength and the
effective focal length of the optical system, respectively, and @xmath
is a vector with dimensions of spatial frequency. @xmath , in turn, can
be expressed in terms of the joint phase aberration @xmath caused by the
telescope and the turbulence as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

The phase aberration can be parametrized by using a Zernike polynomials
expansion (see Appendix A)

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the pupil radius, is the vectorial notation for @xmath
with @xmath defined in a unit circle @xmath and @xmath being the
azimuthal angle.

Thus, equation 1.16 can be then written as

  -- -- -- --------
           (1.18)
  -- -- -- --------

where @xmath are the coefficients of the terms in the Zernike expansion
and @xmath is the diverse phase, i.e. the induced defocus in our case.
The final result is that the OTF (equation 1.15 ) and therefore the
error metric @xmath (equation 1.14 ) are parametrized by the expansion
in Zernike polynomials, so that one can write: @xmath . The diverse
phase @xmath will be zero in the case of @xmath that corresponds to the
focus image.

Part of the minimization of the equation 1.14 can be performed
analytically. The solution of the equation @xmath yields an object
estimate @xmath that minimizes the equation 1.14 ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

Replacing @xmath in the equation 1.14 , we obtain a so-called modified
error metric

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

Note that this modified metric is not explicitly depending on the
Fourier transform of the object @xmath but only includes the unknown
@xmath vector. By means of non-linear optimization techniques, we find
the @xmath vector, characterizing the aberration components, that
minimizes the equation 1.20 . Once these components are determined,
@xmath and @xmath can be calculated from equations 1.18 and 1.15 and the
object estimate can be eventually derived from equation 1.19 ,
completing in this way the restoration process.

In conditions of poor seeing, the restored images are sometimes
contaminated by some artifacts like periodic strips or other regular
patterns. This is a consequence of having zeros or quasi-zeros in the
OTFs at some specific spatial frequencies which produce a poor SNR at
these frequencies. Thus, the division in equation 1.19 by the squares of
these nearly zero values cause excessive amplification of some spectral
components. To circumvent this drawback, a sort of speckle summation of
various realizations close in time has been successfully used. This
summation carries out compensation for spectral information gaps in the
Fourier domain. From equation 1.19 and summing up @xmath realizations,
one can easily derive

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is not affected by the @xmath -subscript because it must be
unique, i.e. the estimate of the true signal that we are seeking ⁵ ⁵ 5
For more detailed information on the PD-method see e.g. Bonet & Márquez
( 2003 ) ; Criscuoli et al ( 2005 ) and references therein. .

#### 1.5 Multi-Object Multi-Frame Blind Deconvolution

The MFBD (Multi-Frame Blind Deconvolution) is a restoration method that
uses multiple frames, bringing in such a way complementary information
to recover the aberrations affecting the images (MFBD; Löfdahl , 2002 ,
1996 ) . The method generally works in a better way when the contrast is
high, the exposure time is short and the noise is low.

An extension of the MFBD, named Multi-Object Multi-Frame Blind
Deconvolution (MOMFBD; Van Noort, Rouppe van der Voort & Löfdahl , 2005
) , has made possible to use, apart from multiple frames, also multiple
objects simultaneously observed, to restore the images in a more
efficient way. By different objects we mean the same field-of-view in
the Sun but observed in different wavelengths (within a rather narrow
spectral range). For each object, PD focus-defocus pairs can also be
included. The observations in all channels must be simultaneous so that
we can assure a common atmospheric aberration. The joint restoration of
several objects has also the advantage that almost perfect alignment can
be achieved between all of them.

Figure 1.3 shows a sketch of the optical setup at the Swedish Solar
Telescope (Observatorio Roque de los Muchachos). The MOMFBD technique is
applied independently to the blue and the red channels. The G-band and
G-cont beams in the figure are splitted into two channels
(focus-defocus) that produce PD image-pairs. Red channel has also its
own PD-pair ⁶ ⁶ 6 The detailed description of the setup will be
commented in the next chapter when dealing with the observations we
pursued in different campaigns. .

Throughout this thesis work we employ all the restoration methods
described above (i.e. PD, MFBD and MOMFBD) depending on the particular
circumstances for each situation. The high-spatial-resolution achieved
by using these methods is evident from the results shown in all the
different chapters.

### Chapter 2 In-flight calibration of IMaX aberrations \dropping

[0pt]2One of the main concerns of this thesis has an instrumental
nature. This chapter is devoted to present the assignments I have
developed in this field as a member of the Imaging Magnetograph
eXperiment (IMaX) project at the IAC in Tenerife. Initially, a brief
preliminary part is presented to introduce the balloon-borne SUNRISE
project conceived to pursue high-resolution solar observations and from
which IMaX is part of. Afterwards, I will introduce the IMaX concept.
Finally, I will explain with great detail the specific part I have
performed within the IMaX project that consists in designing a robust
method to calibrate the in-flight instrumental aberrations of IMaX.

#### 2.1 Sunrise

The SUNRISE project consists of a balloon-borne 1-m aperture solar
telescope (Figure 2.1 ) that aims at high-resolution
spectro-polarimetric observations of the solar atmosphere, to be flown
in the framework of NASA’s LDB (Long Duration Balloon) program in 2009,
in a series of flights on circumpolar trajectories at a float altitude
of 35 - 40 km. The main goal of the project is understanding the
formation of magnetic structures in the solar atmosphere and their
interaction with the plasma convective flows. The SUNRISE equipment
consist of the main telescope feeding two focal-plane instruments
through a light distribution system. These instruments have been
developed by several PI institutions ¹ ¹ 1 Max Planck Institute for
Solar System Research (MPS), Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC),
Kiepenheuer-Institut für Sonnenphysik (KIS), High Altitude Observatory
(HAO), Lockheed-Martin Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory (LMSAL). :

-    Telescope: Gregorian design. Carbon fiber based telescope structure
    with 1m Schott Zerodur lightweighted primary mirror.

-    ISLiD: Image Stabilisation and Light Distribution System that
    ensures capability of simultaneous observations with all science
    instruments, based on all-dielectric dichroic beam splitters (see
    Figure 2.2 ). An important part of the ISLID is the so-called
    Correllator and Wavefront Sensor (CWS) system in charge of image
    stabilisation and correction of optics misalignments and defocus.

-    SUFI: The Sunrise Filter Imager is a filtergraph for
    high-resolution images in the visible and UV spectral ranges.

-    IMaX: Imaging Magnetograph eXperiment, is a magnetograph providing
    fast-cadence two-dimensional maps of the complete magnetic field
    vector and the line-of-sight velocity as well as white-light images
    with high spatial resolution.

With all this equipment, SUNRISE will provide spectra and images
resolving spatial scales down to 35 and 70 km on the Sun in the
ultra-violet and visible ranges, respectively. Figure 2.2 sketches the
concept of the SUNRISE project. The main telescope in panel (b) puts the
light beam into the optical bench in panel (a) being M4 the interface
between both subsystems. The light beam is folded by the tip/tilt mirror
and afterwards splitted into two channels, one feeding the CWS for
wavefront sensing and the other reaching a dichroic plate that separates
the specific wavelength for SUFI and IMaX, respectively. The CWS
generates electric signals: S1 for steering the tip/tilt mirror and S2
to control M2 in order to correct for defocus and optical misalignments.

#### 2.2 The Imaging Magnetograph eXperiment

As briefly explained in the last section IMaX is one of the instruments
part of the payload of the SUNRISE balloon. It will allow to study the
dynamics and evolution of the solar magnetic field as well as its
interaction with the plasma, with high temporal, spatial and spectral
resolutions and unprecedented polarimetric sensitivity. This instrument
will then provide magnetograms of extended solar regions by combining
high temporal cadence and polarimetric precision while preserving the
bidimensional integrity of the images. To meet this goal IMaX has to
work as a:

-    High-efficient image acquisition system.

-    Near diffraction limited imager.

-    High resolving power spectrograph.

-    High sensitivity polarimeter.

Figure 2.3 shows the final optical and mechanical design of the
instrument in a 3D representation; the main optical components will be
described in detail in the next section. Table 2.1 lists the main
parameters of the instrument.

##### 2.2.1 Optical description

The box diagram in Figure 2.4 shows a concise description of the IMaX
optical configuration ² ² 2 From the IMaX Final Optical Design document
SUN-IMaX-RP-IX200-023. (see figure caption).

Figure 2.4 ( lower panel ) shows a more detailed view of the IMaX
optical layout that will be briefly commented in the next lines. The
optical interface with SUNRISE is the ISLiD Focus F4. Next to F4 we
locate the prefilter (PF) set (bandwidth 1Å) and the modulator based on
Liquid Cristal Variable Retarders (LCVRs or ROCLIs). After suffering the
selected polarization, the beam passes through a collimator system
consisting of 2 lenses and a doublet. In the collimated space we locate
one solid Fabry-Perot Interferometer (which cavity is LiNbO @xmath ³ ³ 3
Due to its unique electro-optical, photoelastic, piezoelectric and
non-linear properties Lithium Niobate (LiNbO @xmath ) is widely used in
a variety of integrated and active acousto-optical devices. ) in the
position of a pupil image of the SUNRISE system. The etalon operates in
double pass which means that the light passes once through it, then
reflects back by means of two folding mirrors and crosses for the second
time the etalon. The beam is then focused by an imaging optical system
(camera optics) that consist of a doublet and two lenses. A cubic
polarizing beamsplitter divides the light beam into two branches, to
form in the CCDs respective images with orthogonal polarization states.
A parallel glass plate can be optionally inserted in the light path
between the BS and one of the CCDs for calibration purposes by applying
the post-facto phase diversity technique. We will extensively detail the
phase diversity mechanism in section § 2.3 .

#### 2.3 The Phase Diversity plate

As commented in the last section, the IMaX design includes a mechanism
to apply the Phase Diversity technique for calibration purposes
(wavefront sensing). According to section §1.4 where the PD method is
described, we need to combine information included in at least two
simultaneous images of the object, one being the conventional
focal-plane image that is degraded by the unknown system aberrations we
are interested in, and the other one affected by the same unknown
aberrations plus an extra known aberration intentionally induced.

For the sake of simplicity this extra aberration is commonly chosen as a
defocus (see Appendix A) induced by simply displacing one of the cameras
out of focus by a certain known distance that we will also term
diversity . For IMaX another alternative was implemented since the
displacement of the camera could generate inertial problems caused by
redistribution of masses or vibrations when moving a heavy CCD. One
alternative option to induce defocus in one of the images without moving
the CCD camera to avoid the above mentioned problems, consist on
intercalating a light plane-parallel glass plate in front of one the
CCDs to induce a known displacement of the image focus as will be
described below.

The defocus aberration can be described as an excess/defect in the
radius of the spherical wavefront with respect to the value that would
be required to form the image of a point source at the nominal focus
@xmath (see Figure 2.5 ). The subtraction between both wavefronts give
us the defocus aberration function @xmath that turns out to be a
paraboloid function.

Geometric considerations lead to the following relationship between the
axial displacement of the image plane ( @xmath ) and the defocus
aberration function

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the aperture, @xmath , @xmath is the radial distance
from the pupil center, @xmath is the working wavelength and @xmath the
effective focal length of the system.

On the other hand, the defocus aberration function expressed as a
Zernike polynomial in the Noll’s basis (see Appendix A) is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the defocus weighting coefficient (in radian). The last
term @xmath in equation 2.2 represents an offset that is not affecting
the shape of the wavefront but only an axial shift (piston). Thus we can
relate expressions in equations 2.1 and 2.2 as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

and finally obtain the displacement in terms of the coefficient @xmath
(in radian ):

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

By replacing the IMaX working parameters (Table 2.1 ) in the last
expression we obtain @xmath as proportional to @xmath as follows: @xmath
= - 4.68923 @xmath mm.

This relation will be used later on to have an intuitive and also
quantitative feeling about how significant is a defocus aberration
expressed as a certain @xmath value.

Apart from the axial displacement @xmath , another way to characterize
the amount of defocus is by means of the Peak-to-Valley (PV) optical
path difference (OPD) which obviously corresponds to the value of the
defocus aberration function at the pupil edge. According to expression
2.1 this value is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

or in wavelength units

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

Table 2.2 presents the defocus aberration in terms of the PV optical
path difference corresponding to the focus displacement along the
optical axis for a telescope with @xmath = 45.0 and @xmath 525.02 nm,
which are the adopted values in IMaX.

As a rule of thumb, an amount of defocus corresponding to @xmath = 1
@xmath at the pupil edge has proved to be satisfactory for the phase
diversity inversions. Using the IMaX parameters (see Table 2.1 ), and by
setting @xmath = 1 @xmath , we obtain a value for the focus displacement
along the axis @xmath = 8.51 mm.

As mentioned above, we will induce the image plane displacement by
employing a glass plate of thickness d, as shown in Figure 2.6 . This
displacement can be mathematically formulated by the expression

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the refractive index of the material. The thickness of
the plate required to produce a desired displacement depends on the
refractive index of the optical glass commercially available, and for
IMaX the selected material was Fused Silica ⁴ ⁴ 4 Fused Silica is a high
purity synthetic amorphous silicon dioxide. This noncrystalline,
colorless, silica glass combines a very low thermal expansion
coefficient with excellent optical qualities and exceptional
transmittance over a wide spectral range and is also resistant to
scratching and thermal shock. with @xmath =1.461. Assuming a PV
aberration of 1 @xmath or equivalently @xmath =8.51 mm as reported
above, the required thickness for our PD plate would be @xmath =27 mm.

###### Defocus tolerance

The image blurring permitted for an instrument can be specified by the
diameter of the blur spot or as the angle ( @xmath ) subtended by such a
diameter. For a given @xmath of acceptable blurring, the focus deepness
is lower towards the lens that in the backward direction.

A criterion for the defocus tolerance can be made by fixing the blur
angle @xmath permitted for our purposes. For instance, we can select
@xmath as the value of the diffraction cutoff wavelength, that is
slightly greater than the Full-Width at Half-Maximum (FWHM) of the Airy
spot. According to this criterion the defocus tolerance @xmath can be
expressed as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

Nevertheless, this criterion is quite severe and there is another
less-strict and more commonly used to establish the limit of the defocus
tolerance in an optical system. This criterion is based on the loss of
intensity in the central part of the PSF.

Rayleigh ⁵ ⁵ 5 Lord Rayleigh (John William Strutt), 1842-1919, Nobel
prize in Physics in 1904. first (for the spherical aberration) and other
authors afterwards (for other aberrations), demonstrated that when the
PV value of the error in the wavefront is @xmath , the central intensity
of the PSF of the system reduces by less than 20 @xmath with respect to
the central intensity of the Airy function.

Marechal demonstrated that when the rms of the wavefront aberration in
an optical system is @xmath , the central intensity of the PSF also
reduces by less than 20 @xmath , or in other words, the Strehl ratio ⁶ ⁶
6 The Strehl ratio of an optical system is defined as the quotient
between the central intensities of the real PSF and the theoretical one
assuming a diffraction limited system, the latter being the Airy
function. @xmath PSF @xmath . This ratio is closely related to the
sharpness criteria for optics defined by Karl Strehl. is @xmath 0.8.

Both limits described above, @xmath for the PV value or @xmath for the
rms, are commonly accepted as tolerable when establishing whether or not
a system achieves the resolution limit for practical purposes. These
limits are referred to as the @xmath -Rayleigh and the Marechal image
quality criteria, respectively.

Born & Wolf ( 1999 ) study the distribution of intensity in a volume
around the focus in a diffraction limited optical system and, in
particular, the intensity in the central part of the PSF along the
optical axis. In this study it is demonstrated that to reduce the
central intensity of the PSF by a 20 @xmath , the displacement as
measured from the nominal focus is given by the equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

This is the classical limit adopted as the tolerance for the defocus, an
it is based on the above described Rayleigh and Marechal criteria. Note
that the difference in both defocus tolerances in equations 2.8 and 2.9
is a factor of 2, meaning that the last one is more permissive as a
quality criterion.

With the IMaX parameters (in Table 2.1 ) the defocus tolerances @xmath
for the instrument according to both defocus criteria are, respectively,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

Nevertheless, the modelled defocus error in IMaX, stemming from optical
tolerancing and thermal effects, remains within the tolerance range even
in the more restrictive case ( @xmath 1.06 mm).

#### 2.4 Defining the method for the in-flight calibration of the IMaX
image aberrations

The goal of this section is to define the procedure that will be
employed in IMaX to calibrate the image degradation during the flight.
The proposed calibration procedure is based on the PD-speckle technique
for image reconstruction and wavefront sensing (see section §1.4). To
that aim IMaX has been provided by a PD-plate to intentionally induce a
controlled defocus.

The PD-plate can be optionally intercalated in one of the IMaX imaging
channels (see Figure 2.7 and section 2.3 ) so that a simultaneous
focus-defocus image-pair, i.e. a PD image-pair, can be recorded. From
this pair an estimate of the aberrations will be possible in
post-processing by means of a PD inversion code. PD-inversions
throughout this chapter have been performed with an IDL code developed
by Bonet & Márquez ( 2003 ) .

Assuming a long-term variation in the instrumental aberrations, the
image acquisition for calibration could be performed with a cadence of
one hour. A burst of 25-30 PD-pairs taken in a short time interval in
the spectral continuum would be enough each time. This way we get a
large amount of information ⁷ ⁷ 7 Improving the SNR. collected within a
sufficiently short time period so that it can be assumed negligible
evolution of the solar structures in the FOV. The averaged results from
the PD-inversions of these calibration image-pairs in a post-facto
process will provide a description of the aberrations also affecting our
science spectral images and, in turn, the maps of the full-Stokes
vector. Subsequently, the science images will be reconstructed by using
a standard deconvolution code to nearly reach the diffraction limit of
SUNRISE.

The organogram of Figure 2.8 shows a schematic representation of the
sequential steps in the post-processing calibration procedure.

#### 2.5 Testing the robustness of the calibration method

The purpose of this section is to evaluate by means of numerical
simulations, the robustness of the method we have implemented for the
wavefront error calibration in IMaX, versus a variety of aberration
assumptions. To pursue the numerical experiments we select an
isoplanatic patch consisting of a portion of one of the synthesized
images of solar granulation, from the MHD model developed by Vögler et
al. ( 2005 ) ; Schüssler et al ( 2003 ) . The spatial resolution of this
synthetic image is much higher than that corresponding to the cutoff
frequency in SUNRISE ⁸ ⁸ 8 In order to be as realistic as possible
constructing the theoretical images one has to consider the spectral
contamination by the wings and lobes of the filter transmission curve
@xmath . For this purpose a sequence of images are constructed from the
theoretical model for different @xmath ’s around our working @xmath :
@xmath . This sequence has been convolved with @xmath : @xmath = @xmath
and from the resulting sequence @xmath the central image in our working
@xmath is extracted. These calculations have been done by D. Orozco
Suárez. , and represents what will be termed hereafter the true object .

The testing procedure will consist in simulating the formation of PD
image-pairs as produced by a telescope with the SUNRISE aperture and a
given set of aberrations (model of aberrations). A total of 30
image-pairs for different photon noise realizations is hereby obtained.
The resulting degraded image-pairs are re-sampled to the IMaX pixel size
and inverted with the PD-code. This set of images will be processed
according to the diagram sketched in Figure 2.8 applied to the
particular case of only one isoplanatic patch, and the set of averaged
aberrations retrieved from the inversions will be compared to the input
model of aberrations.

In our simulations we intend to reproduce the global aberration as close
as possible to the real one affecting the image quality when the
instrument is acquiring data in real-time. For this purpose we need to,
firstly, identify the potential sources of error and, secondly, make
realistic assumptions about the quantitative contribution from each of
them.

##### 2.5.1 Identifying the error sources

The contribution from the different error sources can be mathematically
represented through the generalized pupil function (see equation 1.18)
as follows,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the terms in the exponential stand for:

  -------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  @xmath   @xmath Differential aberration between focus/defocus channels @xmath phase diverse.
  @xmath   @xmath Main mirror polishing error.
  @xmath   @xmath Phase error from the etalon.
  @xmath   @xmath Low-order optical system aberrations common in focus/defocus channels.
  @xmath   @xmath Atmospheric aberration which is negligible in IMaX.
  @xmath   @xmath Transmission function over the pupil.
  -------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition we have to include in the error budget the pixel integration
effect in the CCD and the noise.

@xmath and @xmath will be expressed as a polynomial expansion in a basis
of Zernike as explained in section §1.4. The rest of the contributions
will be introduced as amplitude- or phase-screens constructed according
to a model or obtained from direct laboratory measurements.

We emphasize that the formulation of the Zernike’s basis we use
corresponds in all cases to that introduced by Noll ( 1976 ) as stated
in section §1.4.

##### 2.5.2 Quantifying the contribution of the error sources

The opto-mechanical elements in SUNRISE which are affecting the
formation of our images are: Telescope , ISLiD , mechanical interface
with IMaX and IMaX itself (see Figure 2.2 for a schematic view of the
optical design including all these components). The first step is,
consequently, the compilation of data from the design and specifications
of all the different components ⁹ ⁹ 9 Most of these data have already
been published in the IMaX technical document: SUN-IMaX-RP-IX200-023
IMaX Final Optical Design (2007) . .

Table 2.3 lists a compendium of some nominal values for the rms
wavefront error ( rms-WFE ) derived from the optical design including
the statistical modelling for the optical tolerancing and the thermal
behaviour of the systems ¹⁰ ¹⁰ 10 Thermal effects are simulated with an
optical design software ( CODE V ) by varying the refractive index and
the geometry of the opto-mechanical components as a function of the
temperature and the expansion coefficients. Temperature variations, for
instance, are taken into account in the expected range except in those
components having their own temperature control in a lower range (i.e
Liquid Cristal Variable Retarders - LCVRs -, etalon, etc). Simulations
are meant to study the aberration for three possible cases: operative ,
hot and cold . It is mandatory to know the thermal variation of the
refractive index ( @xmath ) for every optical material and the thermal
expansion coefficient for every opto-mechanical element. The thermal
effects have been studied for IMaX as a whole and also for its main
components independently (e.g. the PD-plate, etc). The calculations were
made under the assumption of a temperature variation range of 15 @xmath
7.5 @xmath C. However, further improvements in the thermal system (May
2008) have provided a more restrictive range for the temperature
excursions: 24.5 @xmath 0.5 @xmath C. This implies that the rms-WFE
values in the table, derived from the former thermal model, are rather
pessimistic estimations. Nevertheless, we preserved them because new
estimations are not available for all cases yet. Moreover, testing the
robustness of our calibration method with over-degraded images will
reinforce the conclusions about the reliability of the calibration
method. Optical tolerancing is a critical step in the design of an
optical system. The objective is to define a fabrication and assembly
tolerance budget and to accurately predict the resulting as-built
performance, including the effects of compensation. Also part of the
study is determining the best set of compensators. .

The rms values shown hereafter are computed excluding piston and image
displacement (tip/tilt) from the error budget.

###### Low-order optical system aberrations

In addition to the above mentioned mean parameters describing the rms
aberration in Table 2.3 , we also have available the sets of Zernike
coefficients corresponding to the nominal design for both,
Telescope+ISLiD and IMaX , up to a total of 36 modes (7 @xmath order)
starting from the term of index 4, i.e. defocus (see columns 2 and 3 in
Table 2.4 ). Respective rms-WFE are included in Table 2.3 (1/26 and
1/140 waves).

Initially, at a first stage we represented the model for low-order
aberrations in our numerical experiments by re-scaling the coefficients
of the nominal design by a factor accounting for the thermal effects and
optical tolerancing ¹¹ ¹¹ 11 Let @xmath be the set of Zernike
coefficients of the expantion in the Noll’s basis, approaching a
wavefront aberration. The orthogonality properties of these basis
functions facilitate the calculation of the rms-WFE as @xmath .
Re-scaling the coefficients to provide a wavefront aberration with a
given ( rms-WFE ) @xmath consists of simply computing a new set of
coefficients @xmath such that @xmath ( rms-WFE ) @xmath ( rms-WFE ). ,
excluding the etalon (the contribution of which is explicitly introduced
in the simulations by means of amplitude- and phase-screens supplied by
the manufacturer) and the ISLiD-IMaX interface contribution. In Table
2.3 the re-scaling factors correspond to: Telescope+ISLiD (with optical
tolerancing and thermal effects, item 2) and IMaX (with optical
tolerancing and thermal effects, item 7), so that their values are
1/8.25 and 1/19, respectively. The resulting sets of re-scaled Zernike
coefficients were summed up to give the desired low-order aberrations
model (column 4 in Table 2.4 ).

A criticism to this procedure is that the simple re-scaling preserves
the distribution curve of the nominal Zernike coefficients, which might
be a rather arbitrary statement because the contribution from optical
tolerancing and thermal effects could modify in a non-proportional way
the different aberration terms. Having this in mind, we changed,
according to our possibilities, the criterion to construct the model of
aberrations affecting the images in IMaX.

Table 2.5 complements Table 2.3 by adding new empirical measurements and
other considerations regarding the wavefront errors. Once IMaX has been
manufactured and assembled (excluding etalon and PD-plate), the
aberrations have been calibrated in the laboratory by using a Zygo
Interferometer at INTA. Figure 2.9 shows the arrangement in the
laboratory including IMaX and Zygo, sketching the optical elements and
the light paths along the whole system when calibrating the optical
aberrations of IMaX. The etalon and PD-plate drawn in the sketch have
been actually removed for this calibration as mentioned above.

From these measurements we obtained the Zernike coefficients approaching
the real IMaX aberrations (excluding etalon and PD-plate) at laboratory
conditions ¹² ¹² 12 Atmospheric pressure and room temperature about 20
@xmath C. At a first stage, laboratory experiments for checking the
thermal behaviour of the system have not been performed. (Column 5 in
Table 2.4 ). The corresponding value for the rms-WFE is 1/16.8 waves
(item 1 in Table 2.5 ).

Concerning the Telescope+ISLiD contribution, we do not have the
laboratory measurements and therefore we have preserved the procedure of
using the coefficients from the nominal design after rescaling by a
factor accounting for the average sources of error (optical tolerancing
and thermal effects; item 2 in Table 2.3 ) numerically modelled (column
6 in Table 2.4 ). Figure 2.10 ( left panel ) plots the Zernike
coefficients for IMaX as measured at the laboratory and the
Telescope+ISLiD coefficients as re-scaled from the nominal ones. The
total added contribution of both (Column 7 in Table 2.4 ) is plotted in
Figure 2.10 ( right panel ) and represents the set of coefficients we
are going to use in the simulations. In all cases we present the Zernike
coefficients corresponding to the Noll’s basis and starting from
coefficient @xmath (defocus). The terms for piston, tip and tilt are
excluded from our model since they do not represent figure errors.

The calculation of the rms-WFE from the quadratic sum of coefficients in
our model produce a joint aberration of 1/6 waves (item 2 in Table 2.5 )
to be compared with the value RSS (=1/7.6 waves) derived from items 2
and 7 in Table 2.3 that represent the global error effect (excluding the
ISLiD-IMaX interface and the etalon) as modelled with CODE V ¹³ ¹³ 13
Software by Optical Research Associates used at INTA for designing and
analysing the IMaX optical configuration. . The difference might be
partially ascribed to the approximate behavior of the RSS parameter
representing the joint aberration of various optical systems.

###### Phase and transmission errors from the etalon

As described before, the etalon is placed onto a conjugate pupil of the
SUNRISE system. Nevertheless, up to this step, we are not including in
the model of aberrations the etalon contribution. The effects induced by
the etalon in amplitude (transmission) @xmath ) @xmath and phase @xmath
will be explicitly included in our simulations. The manufacturer, CSIRO
¹⁴ ¹⁴ 14 Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organisation,
website: http://www.csiro.au/ , provided computer files mapping the
errors in amplitude and phase all over the etalon circular surface of 70
mm of diameter (this information is what we call amplitude- and
phase-screens). Based on these maps we selected two optimal circular
areas of 25 mm of diameter each. The criterion for this selection was to
achieve the best compromise to minimize both the amplitude and phase
errors. The etalon surface was oriented so that the selected circular
areas fitted the position of the pupil image on the etalon operating in
double pass mode. Considering the double pass through the selected areas
we derived from the error maps supplied by the manufacturer, the
amplitude- and phase-screens displayed in Figure 2.11 that exhibit
predominately high-spatial frequency structures (high-order Zernike
modes in the phase-screen). The resulting rms-WFE value is as small as
1/26 waves (Table 2.5 , item 3). The residual piston and tip/tilt were
removed from the phase-screen.

Nevertheless, the problem gets complicated when enclosing the etalon in
the pressurized and thermalized oven (the thermally controlled enclosure
). Interferometric measurements (with Zygo at INTA) of the wavefront
error in double-pass and parallel-beam configuration, unveiled in the
joint etalon+oven system a significant extra contribution of low-order
Zernike modes (column 8 in Table 2.4 and Figure 2.12 ) with a rms-WFE of
1/9.2 waves (item 4 in Table 2.5 ). Since this value comes from the
measured Zernike coefficients, that do not fundamentally describe the
high-spatial frequencies detected in the calibration maps from CSIRO, we
will assume that both contributions are complementary and additive and
so we will treat them in our simulations. The origin of low modes is not
fully-characterized yet though we speculate they are originated by
deformations of the oven windows caused by mechanical stresses or by the
bulge of the etalon itself when applying high voltages (ranging from 0
to 2000 volts) while scanning our working spectral line.

Note that the major contribution to low-order modes in the etalon
corresponds to the defocus coefficient ( @xmath 0.65 rad or 3 mm of
displacement), and we are confident it can be compensated when coupling
the etalon+oven system into IMaX by optimizing the position of the image
focal plane ¹⁵ ¹⁵ 15 By means of an MTFs optical bench. . For this
reason this defocus contribution will be considered as null in our
simulations (first value in column 8 in Table 2.4 ), so that the rms-WFE
ascribed to the etalon+oven in low modes shrinks from 1/9.2 to 1/28.5
(item 5 in Table 2.5 ). The rest of the Zernike coefficients will be
added to the low-order Zernike coefficients characterizing the system
Tel+ISLiD+IMaX (column 7 in Table 2.4 ) thus resulting the total budget
of low-order aberration terms affecting the image formation in IMaX
(column 9 in Table 2.4 and Figure 2.13 ) with a rms-WFE =1/5.2 waves
(item 6 in Table 2.5 ). The total phase error induced by low-order
aberrations will be denoted hereafter as @xmath .

In the final array of Zernike coefficients remains a non-zero value for
defocus stemming mainly from ISLiD. This coefficient can not be set to
zero in the simulations as we did in the case of the etalon defocus
since the ISLiD system has been designed and integrated with total
independence with respect to IMaX. Thus, we have not any chance to
compensate the defocus contribution from ISLiD when fixing the optimum
position of the image focal plane during the IMaX integration.

###### Main mirror polishing errors

Another effect we are meant to include in our numerical experiment is
the so-called ripple . Commented briefly in section § 2.5.1 this error
is caused by the polishing tool on the main mirror surface of the
SUNRISE telescope. The wavefront error induced by this effect is
quantified by a certain rms-WFE that will be, from now on, represented
as rms-ripple and modelled by a phase screen arbitrarily chosen out of a
sample of realizations which average power spectrum matches a von Karman
¹⁶ ¹⁶ 16 Theodore von Karman (1881-1963), originally from Hungary, is
responsible for many advances in aerodynamics, supersonic and hypersonic
airflow characterization, among others. The von Karman spectrum is a
power spectrum of the refractive index fluctuations describing the
atmospheric turbulence. Thus, phase errors caused by atmospheric
turbulence are also standardly modelled to match, in average, a von
Karman power spectrum for given values of the inner- and outer-scale of
turbulence. Inner- and outer-scales mean the smallest/largest spatial
scales of the fluctuations also referred to as smallest/largest eddies
in the turbulent medium. power spectrum, for an outer-scale equal to the
size of the polishing tool (hereafter ripple-scale ). The size assigned
to the ripple-scale in our simulations is 30 cm. Note that the amount of
rms-ripple we are considering is derived from the wavefront and
consequently it is twofold the ripple error in an optical surface
working by reflection. The total phase error induced by ripple will be
denoted hereafter as @xmath .

The ripple can be classified as a high-order modes contribution to the
global WFE. Figure 2.14 shows a ripple screen realization.

###### Phase Diversity plate

As commented in section §2.3 the PD-plate will introduce a defocus in
one of the cameras. Apart from that, we were interested in finding out
other possible contributions from the PD-plate to the error budget of
the global system. To that aim an interferometric calibration of the
isolated glass plate was made at the IAC optical laboratory ¹⁷ ¹⁷ 17 The
laboratory conditions were: temperature 23 @xmath C and humidity 38
@xmath . by means of a Zygo interferometer. The aberrations were
evaluated in 9 footprints of the IMaX telecentric beam (1.88 mm of
diameter each) over the plate, arranged as shown in Figure 2.15 ( right
panel ). A view of the optical setup for the calibration is shown in
Figure 2.15 ( left panel ).

The final results expressed by the Zernike coefficients for each single
footprint are plotted in Figure 2.16 , and the obtained rms-WFE is, in
average, 1/21.3 waves. Although this is a small contribution, we suspect
that it has been over-valuated (i.e. the aberration must be still
smaller) because of some parasitic structures detected in the
interferograms probably caused by reflections at the front and back
faces of the plate. This reflections are the consequence of an
inappropriate light source wavelength differing from the IMaX working
wavelength for which the surface coating was designed and manufactured.
In consequence, apart from its inherent task of displacing the image
plane, we will assume a null contribution from the PD-plate to the error
budget.

Based on the IMaX thermal study ¹⁸ ¹⁸ 18 Performed in May 2008 by Carmen
Pastor Santos at INTA on the basis of the new thermal model
calculations. , Table 2.6 lists for three different cases within the
expected temperature variations range, the amount of defocus (in mm)
induced by the PD-plate.

###### Detector contribution

The CCD mainly produces three effects that degrade the image quality (
Boreman , 2001 ) , namely:

-    Detector footprint effect: It consist of the integration of the
    image information over the surface of the detector elements since
    they have a physical size.

    A detector element with dimensions @xmath and @xmath performs a
    spatial averaging of the irradiance falling onto its surface, that
    in the frequency domain is equivalent to a spatial filtering
    represented by a transfer function OTF @xmath , mathematically
    expressed as

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (2.13)
      -- -------- -- --------

    where @xmath , @xmath represent the components of the spatial
    frequency.

    The smaller the pixel size the broader the resulting transfer
    function and, therefore, the lesser the smoothing in the image when
    recorded by the CCD.

-    Sampling effect: A sampled-imaging system is not shift-invariant
    and the position of the light reaching the detector, with respect to
    the pixels, will affect the final image. This effect is commonly
    treated as a statistical average of the relative image locations
    respect to the CCD.

-    Crosstalk effect: Charge-carrier diffusion ¹⁹ ¹⁹ 19 The absorption
    of photons in a semiconductor material is wavelength dependent: high
    for short-wavelength photons and decreases for longer-wavelength
    photons. With less absorption the long-wave photons penetrate deeper
    into the material and thus the charges generated should travel
    longer paths to be collected. and charge-transfer inefficiency ²⁰ ²⁰
    20 It is caused by incomplete transfer of charge packets along the
    CCD delay line. over the detector induce a spurious signal on the
    neighbourhood.

In what follows, we only model in our simulations the first effect,
which is the most significant.

###### Noise

Typically, the noise in the image recorded by a CCD has two components:
the photon noise and the readout noise. Due to the high performance of
the CCDs in IMaX we can neglect, for the sake of simplicity, the
contribution from the readout noise. We will simulate the photon noise
as having a Gaussian distribution with a given rms. As an IMaX
requirement and in order to reach a spectral sensitivity of 10 @xmath
decisive to perform precise polarimetric measurements, the value we
adopt in our simulations is rms-noise =10 @xmath times the signal in the
spectral continuum, i.e. a SNR=10 @xmath in the continuum.

##### 2.5.3 Numerical simulations and results

In order to do a systematical presentation of the numerical experiments
we are going to describe hereafter for various aberration assumptions,
and taking into account all the different error sources described above,
we consider appropriate to classify these error contributions in three
main groups, as follows:

1.   Low-order aberrations (LOA) caused by the following optical
    sub-systems: SUNRISE telescope (excluding polishing errors), ISLiD,
    Interface ISLiD-IMaX, and IMaX excluding high-spatial frequency
    inhomogeneities in the etalon but preserving figure errors caused by
    deformations in the etalon and in the windows of its thermally
    controlled enclosure.

    These aberrations, except for those from the ISLiD-IMaX Interface
    which will not be explicitly considered, are modelled by the set of
    Zernike coefficients listed in column 9 of Table 2.4 with a rms
    wavefront error rms-LOA = 1/5.2 waves (Table 2.5 ). This will be our
    reference value for LOA in our simulations. So as to avoid the
    danger of going to one extreme or the other, whereby either
    excessively pessimistic considerations when evaluating the error
    budget, or the possibility that unexpected error sources could arise
    (e.g uncontrolled spikes in the temperature or pressure variations),
    we will include other cases of aberration in our simulations, with
    rms-LOA values that vary from that of the reference. To do that as
    simple as possible, we will re-scale by a certain factor the list of
    coefficients in column 9 of Table 2.4 . Thus, different cases of LOA
    will be simulated by assuming the following values for rms-LOA : 0,
    1/12, 1/7, 1/5, 1/4, 1/3 and 1/2 waves.

    The efficiency of the PD-inversion is strongly dependent on the
    particular set of LOA terms included in the simulation. For
    instance, the problem becomes simpler when the main contribution to
    the aberration comes from very low order terms. Then, the inversion
    code gives good results by assuming a small number of unknowns
    (e.g. 15 or 21 Zernike coefficients or equivalently 15 or 21
    equations). This simplifies the iterative solution of the equations
    system and speed up the convergence.

2.   High-order aberrations (HOA) caused by ripple in the telescope main
    mirror and by high-spatial frequency inhomogeneities in the etalon
    surface as described by laboratory calibration maps. Figure errors
    in the etalon, induced by high voltages are not included in this
    budget but in the LOA.

    This HOA enter into the simulation code as respective phase-screens.
    The rms-WFE measured for the etalon in double-pass configuration (
    rms-etalon ) is 1/26 waves (Table 2.5 ) and will be considered as a
    fixed value in all numerical experiments in which this effect is
    included. For the polishing errors three different cases will be
    considered: rms-ripple =0, 2/60 and 2/28 waves. The way we write
    down the precedent values as fractions with a nominator 2 is meant
    to denote the effect of reflection of the wavefront in the main
    mirror (e.g. in the case 2/60 we are adding two contributions:
    1/60 + 1/60, each of them corresponding to the rms-ripple
    characterizing the mirror surface). Apart from the etalon
    phase-screen, we also have available an amplitude-screen mapping its
    transmission inhomogeneities.

3.   Pixel integration in the CCD and Noise . The first effect is
    simulated by an analytical formula (see equation 2.13 ) as a
    function of the pixel size (fixed value equals 12 @xmath m). The
    noise contribution is introduced into the code as noise-screens
    generated by an IDL ²¹ ²¹ 21 The Interactive Data Language is a
    widely known programming language that is a popular data analysis
    language among scientists. simulator of pseudo-random signals with
    Gaussian distribution for a given rms value. As justified above, we
    take for all considered cases a fixed value rms-noise =10 @xmath
    (the signal in the spectral continuum).

In what follows, a variety of aberration models will be made up by
combining weighted contributions from different error sources. In an
attempt to approach the real observations when recording bursts of 30
image-pairs for calibrations (see section §2.4), 30 realizations of
noise will be systematically performed for every aberration model
adopted.

Table 2.7 reports on the different ingredients composing the aberration
models considered in every numerical experiment. The results of these
experiments are displayed in Figures from 2.17 to 2.28 .

###### Key notes for the interpretation of Figures 2.17 to 2.28

Figures 2.17 , 2.20 , 2.23 , 2.26 display PD-speckle reconstructed
images from 30 realizations for every aberration assumption. Lying below
every restored scene we present one out of the 30 realizations of the
in-focus degraded images. To facilitate the visual comparison between
different images, all of them are displayed by employing a common
gray-scale ranging from the minimum to the maximum intensity values of
the true object shown at the upper right corner for reference. This way,
real differences in contrast and resolution can easily be detected by
eye.

Apart from the visual comparison, we also calculate the values of
different parameters to quantify the degree of success achieved in our
numerical experiments basically consisting of: degradation followed by
PD-inversion . Figures 2.18 , 2.19 , 2.21 , 2.22 , 2.24 , 2.25 , 2.27
and 2.28 are arranged in three columns. The panels in left, middle and
right columns of the figures correspond to different assumptions for the
rms-ripple : 0, 2/60 and 2/28 waves, respectively. The abscissae in all
panels stand for different cases of rms-LOA . Bullets linked by dotted
lines show the mean values resulting from PD-inversions. Vertical bars
represent the dispersion of these results caused by 30 different
realizations of photon noise. Dashed lines represent the values of the
different parameters in the degraded (smeared) images simulated.

To evaluate the reliability of the results from the PD-process we need
some expected reference values for comparison, e.g. the contrast of the
true object that should ideally by reached after restoration, or the
zero value that should ideally result from the subtraction of certain
wavefronts (see thick solid lines in Figures 2.18 , 2.21 , 2.24 and 2.27
). We also use as a reference the results of the restoration @xmath
performed with expression 1.21, by only employing the input Zernike
terms simulating the LOA of the system, @xmath (see thin solid lines in
Figures 2.18 , 2.21 , 2.24 and 2.27 ).

Subscripts t,s,r and Z in Figures 2.18 , 2.21 , 2.24 and 2.27 stand for
true object , smearing (simulated degradation), reconstruction with PD,
and restoration performed with only the Zernikes representing the LOA in
the input, respectively.

###### Experiment 1

Combined effects considered (see also Table 2.7 ).
@xmath rms-ripple = 0, 2/60 and 2/28 waves. @xmath rms-LOA = 0, 1/12,
1/7, 1/5, 1/4, 1/3 and 1/2 waves. @xmath rms-noise = 10 @xmath continuum
signal (30 realizations per aberration model.) @xmath No CCD effects.
@xmath No etalon effects: @xmath 1 , @xmath 0. @xmath PD-defocus in mm
(degradation/inversion): 8.51 / 8.51. @xmath Inversion with 25
coefficients.

A glance at Figure 2.18 , rows (a), (b), (c), reveals that the results
derived from the application of PD to the simulated observations and the
expected values for different parameters (thick solid line) are in good
agreement when rms-ripple =0 or 2/60 waves ( left and middle columns )
and rms-LOA =0, 1/12, 1/7, 1/5 or 1/4 waves. Thus the retrieved rms
contrast for @xmath ranges from 16 @xmath to 17.4 @xmath versus the
reference rms( @xmath )=17.5 @xmath ; the mean absolute difference mean
@xmath remains always below 2.5 @xmath and rms( @xmath ) below 3.5
@xmath . In many cases the results are also reasonably good for rms-LOA
=1/3 waves but always noticeably worse for the case rms-LOA =1/2 waves.

The figure shows that the results from the PD-inversions deviate
progressively from the reference values as long as the amount of ripple
and LOA augment in the simulated aberrations. This behavior reflects the
limitations of the method stemming from: 1) the unsensed aberrations due
to the limited number of Zernikes used in the inversion (25 coefficients
versus 36 employed to simulate LOA in the total system -see Table 2.4 ;
2) the influence of the also non-sensed HOA terms present in the ripple
²² ²² 22 In further experiments also the inhomogeneities in the etalon
phase will bring additional HOA contribution. ; 3) the noise in the
data; and 4) the instabilities in the PD-method itself.

The comparison of the bullet-dotted with the dashed lines evidences the
enormous improvement obtained from PD-inversions with respect to the
smeared images. It is worth mentioning that Figure 2.18 , rows (a), (b),
(c), (d), show the good coincidence (within the above mentioned range
rms-ripple @xmath 2/60 and rms-LOA @xmath 1/4) between the bullet-dotted
and the thin solid lines , the latter representing the results of the
deconvolution performed by only employing the Zernike coefficients
assumed as the input to simulate LOA in the total system. This
coincidence, even extensive to the third column, reveals that the
PD-algorithm compensate reasonably well at least for the degradation
caused in the simulation by LOA terms. Note also that, for a given
parameter and for rms-LOA @xmath 1/4, the variation trend in the
bullet-dotted and thin solid lines is quite similar in the three
columns, being the main difference between these variations a vertical
offset which increases from the left to the right columns. We ascribe
these offsets to a loss of contrast caused by the ripple.

Ripple errors are high-frequency phase errors and can be viewed as noise
in the wavefront since they can hardly be modelled even with very high
order Zernike terms in a polynomial expansion. The consequence of these
errors is a transfer of energy from the peak of the PSF to its far wings
thus producing stray-light and consequently an unrecoverable loss of
contrast as evidenced in Figure 2.18 , row (a) – this degradation
increases as the ripple-scale decreases ( Bello , 2001 ) . Thus, large
values of rms-ripple have more impact on the image contrast than on the
image resolution since the latter is related to the FWHM of the PSF
that, for well corrected systems, changes rather slowly ²³ ²³ 23
According to equations 1.15, 1.16 and the auto-correlation theorem, the
PSF of an optical system is proportional to the power spectrum of the
generalized pupil function. Consequently, the presence of high-spatial
frequencies in @xmath will cause a long tail in the power spectrum or
equivalently long wings in the PSF of the system. Furthermore, the
energy conservation forces the normalization of the volume enclosed by
the PSF; thus the extension of its wings will be done at the expenses of
an intensity decrease at shorter distances, in particular at its central
point. If, apart from the ripple, the optical system is well corrected,
this transfer of energy from short to long distances will provoke a
clear decrease in the central intensity of the PSF as long as the ripple
increases, but because of the very steep slopes in the PSF core, the
FWHM of the PSF will scarcely be affected. . Note that the Strehl ratio
is strongly dependent on the amount of ripple (see panels in row (f) of
Figure 2.18 ). The case rms-ripple =2/28 has only an academic interest
in our simulations because we expect a better polishing quality in the
SUNRISE main mirror surface ²⁴ ²⁴ 24 In fact the expected rms values for
polishing errors as measured on the mirror surface range from 5 to 10
nm. For our working wavelength, @xmath 525.02 nm, this range corresponds
to 1/100 to 1/50 waves, which includes the value 1/60 assumed as the
second case for rms-ripple in our simulations. .

Stray-light in solar photometry represents a problem that classically
has been faced from various approaches, all of them based on modelling
the far wings of the PSF by linear combinations of Gaussian and
Lorentzian functions, the parameters of which are determined from solar
aureole measurements ( Martínez Pillet , 1992 , and references therein)
. In spectro-polarimetry, being the case of IMaX, stray-light is a
particularly delicate issue because it represents a contamination of the
magnetic signal at a given feature by the signal originated in other
structures located all around the feature even at quite large distances
(e.g. @xmath arc minutes).

The loss of contrast and spatial resolution, as long as the rms-ripple
and rms-LOA increase, can be visually appreciated in the strips of
restored images in Figure 2.17 . Image resolution is particularly
affected by rms-LOA @xmath 1/4 waves: medium-high spatial frequency
structures, grains-like or fringes-like patterns start arising. These
artifacts originate because the OTF in these cases drops to
close-to-zero values in a range at medium-high spatial frequencies ²⁵ ²⁵
25 This effect is favoured by the central obscuration in the SUNRISE’s
pupil inherent to the particular design adopted for this telescope. The
central obscuration depresses the central region of the MTF in
comparison with its typical shape for diffraction-limited telescopes
with clear aperture. See Figure 2.29 illustrating this depression. and
are more evident in single-restored images before doing the speckle
summation of equation  1.21 (see discussion at the end of section §1.4).
Thus, the final product for single restorations is often arbitrarily
affected by over restoration of some particular spectral components.

In Figure 2.19 , thick lines represent the variation of the Zernike
coefficients (up to index 11) used as the input to simulate the LOA
(i.e. the reference for comparison), whereas thin lines mark simply the
zero level. Bullet-dotted lines represent again values retrieved from
the PD-inversion process. In most cases the coincidence of the retrieved
coefficients with the expected values is quite good even in the right
column of the figure (we exclude from this comparison the case rms-LOA
=1/2 waves). Nevertheless, the deviations encountered from the reference
values could probably be ascribed to cross-talk between the limited
number of Zernike terms employed in the PD-inversions (25 terms) in an
attempt to compensate for the contribution of higher-order terms which
are in fact present in the simulated wavefront: we have used 36 terms to
simulate the system LOA and, furthermore, we can not disregard the
contribution from polishing errors and noise to the signal. In other
words, as argued by Löfdahl & Scharmer ( 1994 ) the inversion program
compensates for the missing high-order terms by introducing errors in
the lower Zernike coefficients. To understand such compensations, we
note that the inversion algorithm does not attempt to derive the best
fit to the wavefront. Because of the chosen error metric (see
equation 1.19), the inversion attempts to find two internally consistent
(i.e. derived from the same Zernike coefficients) transfer functions for
the focus and defocus images such that the error metric is minimized.
The value of the transfer function at a specific frequency is given by
an average over the aperture of all differences in phase taken at a
fixed separation (see equation 1.15). Thus, mainly at low and
intermediate frequencies, different wavefronts can give similar transfer
functions. This gives the possibilities for compensations and allows the
inversion procedure to find the wavefront that gives the best fit to the
transfer functions given the observed data and the number of Zernike
coefficients used to represent the wavefront. Nevertheless the
improvement given by such compensations is limited because of the
absence of high-spatial frequencies in the lower aberrations.

The panels in rows (d) and (e) in Figure 2.18 deserve a particular
comment. The inversion process yields rms( @xmath ) values that fit rms(
@xmath ) very well, at least up to rms-LOA =1/4 waves. In spite of this
coincidence, the deviation of the parameter rms( @xmath ) from zero
increases as the ripple and the LOA augment. This variation preserves a
similar trend in the three columns of row (e) although it is affected by
a vertical offset in the middle and right columns. Note that the
parameter rms( @xmath ) is also affected by similar offsets. In fact
these offsets coincide, as expected, with the rms-ripple value assigned
to each case. The slope in the variation of rms( @xmath ) could be
justified in terms of the compensations mentioned in the previous
paragraph (cross-talk between low order modes), which reproduce good
transfer functions but not so good wavefront shapes. Apparently, the
difference in the wavefront shape does not imply a substantial
difference between rms( @xmath ) and rms( @xmath ) as shown in the
panels of row (d).

###### Experiment 2

Combined effects considered (see also Table 2.7 ).
@xmath rms-ripple = 0, 2/60 and 2/28 waves. @xmath rms-LOA = 0, 1/12,
1/7, 1/5, 1/4, 1/3 and 1/2 waves. @xmath rms-noise = 10 @xmath continuum
signal (30 realizations per aberration model.) @xmath No CCD effects.
@xmath Etalon effects: @xmath and @xmath derived from lab. calibration
maps. @xmath PD-defocus in mm (degradation/inversion): 8.51 / 8.51.
@xmath Inversion with 25 coefficients.

The only difference of this Experiment with respect to Experiment 1 is
that now we include in the simulated degradation the contribution from
@xmath and @xmath mapping the transmission inhomogeneities and the HOA
of the etalon, respectively. Note that the PD-code is only designed for
the retrieval of the phase-error function in the pupil but not of the
pupil transmission function. Thus, in the inversion process the function
@xmath cannot be considered as an unknown in any case but one has to
presume a certain model for it. In a first attempt we used for the
inversion the same amplitude-screen as the one applied to simulate the
degradation but this way of proceeding generated a disastrous behaviour
in the PD-code with strong fluctuations during the iterative process
that minimizes the error metric, and eventually collapsed the
calculations. So, we were compelled to use in the inversion the simple
ideal model @xmath =1 all over the pupil.

Now we center our attention in the impact of these new complications in
the efficiency of the PD-code to recover the global phase-error
introduced as the input to simulate the degradation. Firstly, we
concentrate in Figure 2.21 , rows (a), (b), (c), for rms-ripple =0, 2/60
waves and for rms-LOA @xmath 1/4 waves. As in Experiment 1, a good
agreement between the results of the inversion and the reference values
is found. In most cases, the contrast rms @xmath ranges from 16.5% to
18.4%, that is, close to the reference value 17.5%. The trends and
ranges in the variations of the mean absolute differences mean @xmath
and of the rms @xmath remain quite similar to those in Figure 2.18 .
However, a significant difference with Experiment 1 deserves special
discussion. Now, for the cases with small rms-LOA @xmath 1/7 waves, the
inversion yields image contrasts rms @xmath overvalued with respect to
the reference one.

We ascribe this result to the non-realistic assumption made when setting
@xmath =1 in the inversions. The error metric to be minimized in the
PD-inversions does not explicitly contain neither the phase, @xmath ,
nor the amplitude, @xmath , that define the generalized pupil function
(expression 1.16), but the OTFs that can be derived from the latter.
Thus, the defective information assigned to the amplitude @xmath can be
compensated by some extra errors – in comparison with Experiment 1 – in
the phase functions provided that the resulting generalized pupil
functions still yield appropriate OTFs that minimize the error metric.
These extra errors are evident from the comparison of Figures 2.18 and
2.21 , rows (d) and (e), and can be the cause of the over-restoration
mentioned above. Figure 2.21 , row (e), also shows the deviations of
rms( @xmath ) from zero. These vertical offsets are related to the HOA
contribution from polishing errors in the main mirror and
inhomogeneities in the etalon surface and, as expected, in the three
panels they very closely amount to RSS= @xmath .

###### Experiment 3

Combined effects considered (see also Table 2.7 ).
@xmath rms-ripple = 0, 2/60 and 2/28 waves. @xmath rms-LOA = 0, 1/12,
1/7, 1/5, 1/4, 1/3 and 1/2 waves. @xmath rms-noise = 10 @xmath continuum
signal (30 realizations per aberration model.) @xmath CCD effects.
@xmath Etalon effects: @xmath and @xmath derived from lab. calibration
maps. @xmath PD-defocus in mm (degradation/inversion): 8.51 / 8.51.
@xmath Inversion with 25 coefficients.

In this Experiment we add to the image degradation one more contribution
with respect to Experiment 2. It consist of the integration over the
pixel area, of the information reaching the image plane as commented in
section § 2.5.2 . Table 2.7 ticks off the error contributions taken into
account for this simulation. Dotted line in Figure 2.29 shows the OTF
@xmath representing the degradation effect which is incorporated to the
total error budget by simple multiplication by the OTF describing the
global aberration in Experiment 2. The new ingredient in the simulated
aberration has no significant impact in the results of the PD-inversion.
Thus, for rms-ripple @xmath 2/60 and rms-LOA @xmath 1/4 waves the
differential impact in the parameters rms @xmath , mean @xmath and rms
@xmath – Figure 2.24 , rows (a), (b), (c) –, with respect to Experiment
2, is smaller than 2 tenths %. Similar coincidences between the results
from Experiments 2 y 3 are achieved for the parameter rms @xmath .
However, the influence of the CCD pixel integration is remarkable in the
Strehl ratio as evidenced by comparing Figures 2.21 and 2.24 , rows (f).

Concerning the retrieved Zernike coefficients from the PD-process, they
look very similar in Figures 2.22 and 2.25 , within the range of
aberrations mentioned above ( rms-ripple @xmath 2/60 and rms-LOA @xmath
1/4 waves). Nevertheless, as discussed in previous paragraphs, small
differences in the Zernike coefficients of both Experiments would not be
crucial provided that the resulting generalized pupil functions yield
appropriate OTFs to obtain a good minimization of the error metric. This
seems to be the case in the present Experiment to judge by the good
image restorations achieved. Therefore, we will consider the results
from Experiment 3 as the reference for the next numerical test.

###### Experiment 4

Combined effects considered (see also Table 2.7 ).
@xmath rms-ripple = 0, 2/60 and 2/28 waves. @xmath rms-LOA = 0, 1/12,
1/7, 1/5, 1/4, 1/3 and 1/2 waves. @xmath rms-noise = 10 @xmath continuum
signal (30 realizations per aberration model.) @xmath CCD effects.
@xmath Etalon effects: @xmath and @xmath derived from lab. calibration
maps. @xmath PD-defocus in mm (degradation/inversion): 8.51 / 9.00.
@xmath Inversion with 25 coefficients.

The recent IMaX thermal design (May 2008) predicts for the PD-plate,
during the flight, a temperature variation range of 24.5 @xmath 0.5
@xmath C. From this thermal model, simulations with CODE V estimate the
defocus displacement induced by the PD-plate ranging from 8.46 mm
(PV-WFE=1.008 waves; hot case) to 8.56 mm (PV-WFE=1.019 waves; cold
case), being 8.51 mm (PV-WFE=1.015 waves) the displacement corresponding
to the operative case (24.5 @xmath C).

The amount of displacement of the image plane produced by the PD-plate,
also called diversity , is an input parameter in the PD-code. One of our
concerns has always been how critical the value assigned to the
diversity is, or in other words, how much robust is the PD-code in
rendering good results versus possible errors in the value of the
diversity . This concern arises from the possibility of having during
the flight unexpected peaks in the temperature fluctuation, out of the
range predicted by the thermal model.

To clarify this question, we have designed the following numerical
experiment: in the inversion process we will take for the diversity the
expected nominal operative value 8.51 mm, whereas in the degradation
process, we will assign to the diversity a different value thus
simulating an unexpected temperature peak which we are not aware of.

In the first realization of the Experiment we have selected for the
degradation process a rather large diversity value (12 mm) as compared
with the nominal one used in the inversion (8.51 mm). Always within our
standard range of analysis (i.e. for rms-ripple @xmath 2/60 and rms-LOA
@xmath 1/4 waves), the inversion produces over-restoration: rms @xmath
ranging from 17.5 to 20.7 %, mean @xmath from 2.6 to 5.5 % and rms
@xmath from 3.6 to 7.1 %. Also the retrieved Zernike coefficients,
particularly @xmath , differ substantially from the reference values. A
curious result is that the values obtained for @xmath are larger than
those corresponding to the Experiment 3 by a roughly constant amount of
about 0.1 waves, corresponding to a defocus distance of @xmath 3 mm,
similar to the diversity error (3.49 mm). It seems like if the error in
the diversity would have misled the PD-algorithm in such a way that this
error is now ascribed to the image in nominal focus position, in the
form of defocus aberration. This could explain the resulting
over-restoration mentioned above. Since this is an extreme experiment
considering diversity values far away from the IMaX case, we do not
display the results.

In a second and more realistic numerical experiment we have selected a
diversity of 9 mm for the degradation process whereas we have kept the
nominal value for the inversion. Thus, the error introduced, 9.00 - 8.51
= 0.49 mm, is greater by a factor of 10 than the expected peak variation
of the diversity ( @xmath 0.05 mm) according to the IMaX thermal model
(Table 2.6 ). Even so, the PD-inversion gives very similar values to
those in Experiment 3 (compare rows (a) to (f) in Figures 2.24 and 2.27
). However, small discrepancies can be detected in the retrieved Zernike
coefficients, from the comparison of Figures 2.25 and 2.28 . In
particular, the bullet-dotted line for @xmath in the latter figure is
shifted upwards by @xmath 0.015 waves ( @xmath 0.44 mm of defocus
distance) with respect to the corresponding line in the former figure.
Again we find that the error in the knowledge of the real diversity is
transferred to the budget of real aberrations in the system, in the form
of a defocus error. Nevertheless, in this case, the impact on the
restorations can be consider as negligible since we get very similar
results to those obtained in Experiment 3.

The repercussion of the discrepancies between the results of Experiments
1, 2, 3 and 4,are very subtle as to be easily detected by comparing the
Figures 2.17 , 2.20 , 2.23 and 2.26 .

###### Case of IMaX

According to the aberrations estimated from laboratory measurements and
realistic models, the case of IMaX fits into Experiment 3 for rms-ripple
@xmath 2/60 and rms-LOA = 1/5 waves. This implies a loss of contrast of
@xmath 5 % of the real value and rms @xmath @xmath 3 % (see Figure 2.24
). Figure 2.29 ( left panel ) shows the diffraction limited MTF ( solid
line ) for SUNRISE. The dotted line is the MTF @xmath representing the
pixel integration effect in the CCD. The dashed line is a section of the
MTF resulting from the total error contribution estimated for the IMaX
images including also the CCD pixel integration effect. The central
depression in the MTF profile is very sensitive to the significance of
LOA in such a way that it can almost reach a zero level at some
particular spatial frequencies (see right panel in Figure 2.29 ). These
singularities complicate the construction of the noise filter (see
section §1.3.2) to be applied in the restoration process.

Figure 2.30 is a comparative plot of the Zernike coefficients used for
degrading the images (from index 4 to 36) and those retrieved from the
inversion process (from index 4 to 25).

#### 2.6 Conclusions

In this chapter, a method for in-flight calibration of aberrations in
IMaX has been proposed. The method is based on the Phase Diversity (PD)
inversion procedure.

The robustness of the method has been tested by numerical experiments
simulating different aberration components. The sources of aberration
have been modelled and added in subsequent experiments. The repercussion
of every new added ingredient in the final result from the inversion has
been evaluated.

The PD-code does not accurately reproduce the shape of the wavefront
errors but provides reliable OTFs for subsequent satisfactory
restorations.

Small-scale irregularities in the wavefront error are not detectable by
the PD-code where a finite (rather low) number of Zernike terms is used.
This limitation mainly produces stray-light all over the restored image
and consequently a loss of contrast. This effect is tolerable within
certain margins, and fixes constraints to the polishing quality in the
main mirror of the SUNRISE’s telescope and to the inhomogeneities in the
etalon of IMaX.

The inhomogeneities in the transmission function of the etalon are
converted by the inversion process into some extra errors in the
resulting wavefront which partially compensate for the loss of contrast
caused by the high-order aberrations terms non-sensed by the PD-code.

Experiment 3 (see Table 2.7 ) includes all the error sources assumed as
significant for IMaX, and the results of its inversions can be
considered reliable enough as to validate the method proposed for the
calibration of errors in the images of IMaX, at least for aberrations
lying in the range: rms-ripple @xmath 2/60 and rms-LOA @xmath 1/4 waves.
The case of IMaX, with the expected values of rms-ripple @xmath 2/60 and
rms-LOA @xmath 1/5 waves, is included in this range of aberrations and,
consequently, the calibration method is applicable to IMaX.

For the case of IMaX, the residual errors in the proposed calibration
method induce, in turn, errors in the subsequent restoration: mean
@xmath @xmath 2.5 %, rms @xmath @xmath 3.3 %, and a loss of rms contrast
@xmath 5 %.

The amount of defocus (also named diversity ) produced by the PD-plate
is a critical parameter in order for the PD-algorithm to work optimally.
We have got acceptable results for errors in the diversity of @xmath 5
%.

## Part II Study of proper motions in solar active regions

### Chapter 3 Solar active regions \dropping

[0pt]2The second part of this thesis, devoted to the study of solar
active regions, is introduced in this chapter based on the revision of
literature published on this topic. Information about solar active
regions is firstly presented starting from the historical point of view,
secondly going into the theoretical and observational framework and
finally reviewing the state-of-the-art in the research on the dynamics
and evolution of photospheric structures around sunspots.

#### 3.1 Introduction

The importance of the Sun for humankind is more than justified as well
as the research on solar physics in which the Sun appears to be a
fabulous laboratory to study multitude of phenomena and fundamental
processes in astrophysics. By the analysis of the radiation ( photons )
coming from the different layers of the Sun (see Figure 3.1 ) scientists
have been able to figure out a large amount of information about the
underlying physics behind our closest star. Telescopes and solar
instrumentation have played an important role since the very first
ground-based observations up to the more recent space telescopes and
future missions trying to untangle the behavior of the Sun. The Sun as a
variable star experiences a changing magnetic activity framed in what is
called the solar cycle. The main cycle is composed by two consecutive 11
years cycles and represents a reversal of the global magnetic field. The
solar cycle is evidenced by the variation of the number of sunspots,
number of solar flares and solar irradiance among other parameters.
Magnetism then dominates the Sun’s behavior and can be studied in more
detail than in any other stellar body. The vast majority of light
leaving the Sun and reaching us (approx. 8 minutes later) comes from the
photosphere, a thin layer of about 500 km of thickness (sort of 0.04
@xmath of the solar radius) that is actually the densest part of the
solar atmosphere, composed by convective cells known as solar
granulation. Underneath the photosphere, convection is taking place
carrying the energy released by thermonuclear fusion in the solar core.
Plasma motions in the underlying convection zone are therefore driving
the dynamical behavior of the photosphere and reveal through the
granulation pattern.

#### 3.2 Sunspots

Sunspots are the most evident manifestation of the solar activity and of
the solar cycle. They are related to the majority of violent phenomena
occurring in the solar external layers and moreover a clear sign of the
magnetism effects in the dynamics and structure of our closest star.
Solar active regions (sunspots and plages) are labeled for
identification by consecutive numbers as they appear on the visible
solar disk. One of the most widely used identifiers is the NOAA
(National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) catalogue. Many
important facts about the sunspots have been studied for many years and
we have learned things about its nature, origin and evolution, but there
are still fundamental questions we are willing to clarify. One of the
important issues about sunspots was to discover that they were the first
astronomical object known to harbor a magnetic field ( Hale , 1908 ) .

Sunspots are nowadays interpreted as complex structures having strong
magnetic fields that inhibit the plasma convection reducing therefore
the efficiency in the convective energy transport. The temperature of
sunspots is for this reason lower than that in the surrounding
photosphere. They are seen as black entities when comparing it with the
outside brightness but actually the temperature inside sunspots goes up
to 5000 K.

Study of sunspots is important because they are connected to intense and
explosive phenomena in the chromosphere and solar corona. Coronal loops,
for instance, are magnetic lines anchored to sunspots that after mutual
interaction and reconnection liberate strong amounts of energy in the
form of the so-called flares and coronal mass ejections (CME). The
released energy travels millions of kilometers before interacting with
the Earth’s atmosphere and affecting the terrestrial communications and
orbiting satellites. Clarifying the sunspots internal structure and
their physical processes is demanding to understand and predict the
solar activity and its influence on Earth.

#### 3.3 Historical overview

The first observations of sunspots on the solar surface brought another
view regarding the incorruptibility of heavens so that at the beginning
many astronomers rejected to believe that sunspots were actually
attached to the Sun. J. Fabricius was the first to write a book on
sunspots in 1611 ( Fabricius , MDCXI ) and independently C. Scheiner
claimed to observe sunspots the same year associating them to orbiting
objects ( Scheiner , 1623-30 ) . Scheiner is also regarded as the first
who evidences velocity fields in the solar photosphere noting that
sunspots near the equator traverse the solar disc faster than those at
higher latitudes. Galileo associated the sunspots to a sort of thick
clouds sharing the solar rotation, as dense that they were able to block
the Sun’s light. He was the first that used the terminology of solar
latitude and longitude to locate sunspots on the Sun. Galileo’s accurate
observations using a rather good telescope for the time being, allowed
him to look at many details on the solar surface. He was also the first
to discover brighter zones which he called faculae . But it was not
until Keppler that sunspots were indeed put right on the solar surface (
Keppler , 1955 ) . Keppler had first postulated that the Sun should
rotate in less than three months but later on reduced the rotating
period to just one day. After proving by means of geometrical arguments
that Scheiner was wrong when considering the behavior of sunspots at the
solar limb, Keppler settled the question, being convinced that spots are
on the Sun as we all know now.

Sunspots observations continued in the XVII century although there is a
lapse from 1645 to 1715 where a very few sunspots were observed. This
fact is known as the Maunder minimum and corresponds to a time period in
which the Earth suffered from very low temperatures and cold winters
that are associated to the reduction of the solar activity. Nowadays,
the Sun is still affecting us directly and indirectly and the Sun‘s
changing magnetic behavior has an influence on the solar neighborhood
climate.

More solar properties and parameters, as the solar axis inclination and
differential rotation rate were inferred by Carrington ( 1859 ) and
confirmed by several studies afterwards. The dynamics of the plasma in
the solar photosphere was found to show several convective patterns at
different spatial scales. In addition to the granular pattern (with
typical diameters of 150-2500 km), the mesogranular one at intermediate
scales (5-10 Mm) and the supergranular one at large scales (over 20 Mm)
organize the plasma in a sort of hierarchical convective structure.
There is still an open debate concerning the nature, origin and
structure of these convective patterns.

For a more extensive and detailed historical review on observations of
sunspots see Casanovas ( 1997 ) and references therein.

#### 3.4 Structure of sunspots

The responsible for the origin and structure of sunspots is believed to
be the deep-seated toroidal (azimuthally oriented) magnetic flux in the
solar interior ( Schüssler et al , 2002 ) . This magnetic flux is
thought to be situated between the convective zone and the radiative
interior and increases by means of a dynamo action up to the formation
of a kind of instability. The eruption of flux leads to the formation of
@xmath -shaped magnetic loops coming up to higher layers, therefore
reaching the convective zone and emerging through the solar surface as
active regions ( Zwaan , 1992 ) . Summarizing this idea, what we have is
that the magnetic field generated underneath the convective zone in the
Sun, emerges to the solar surface forming sunspot groups and active
regions and spreads around its surface through convective mechanisms.

Diverse models for sunspots have been proposed through the years such as
the cluster model and the monolithic model. On the one hand the cluster
( spaghetti ) model developed by Parker ( 1979 ) in which the magnetic
field divides into many separate flux tubes in the first few Mm below
the surface. On the other hand the monolithic model by Cowling ( 1957 )
establishes that the magnetic field underneath the solar surface is
confined to a single flux tube and the plasma flows crossing it are
prohibited.

Sunspots, as complex magnetic structures embedded in a convective
plasma, show many active and changing features on multiple scales.
Convective flows and large-scale plasma circulation plays an important
role in the dynamics and evolution of solar active regions (see, e.g.,
Schrijver & Zwann , 2000 )

Important physical processes are present in sunspots, some of them at
spatial-scales beyond the resolution limit of the current solar
telescopes. In the last years and using the latest restoration
techniques and advances in adaptive optics, the complex magnetic and
dynamic structure of sunspots have been unveiled in some detail.
Nevertheless, there are many important questions concerning them that
remain unanswered yet.

##### 3.4.1 Umbra

The umbra is the central dark area that corresponds to the coolest part
of a sunspot. The temperature inside the umbra is low ( @xmath 3500-5000
K) due to the presence of a strong magnetic field that inhibits the
convective energy transport underneath ( Biermann , 1941 ) . The
magnetic field orientation inside the umbra is vertical respect to the
solar surface and becomes slightly inclined when approaching the
umbra-penumbral boundary. Larger sunspots with bigger umbrae exhibit a
more intense magnetic field strength and the range inside umbrae goes
from 2000 to 3500 Gauss in average. The energy radiation in the umbra is
roughly 20 @xmath of the photospheric value.

Although the umbra seems to be completely dark and with non internal
structure, when observed in high-resolution, a lot of fine features in
its interior can be detected, for instance the umbral dots which are
bright dots with sizes of about 0.2-0.5 arc seconds and hotter than the
umbral background. These features are still under study to clarify and
confirm whether they are related to convective phenomena transporting
some sort of flow. Light bridges are other structures inside the umbra
that look like luminous streaks or narrow bands with different ages and
sizes.

##### 3.4.2 Penumbra

The penumbra is the filamentary and deeply-rooted (thick) structure in a
sunspot that forms the ring-shaped part surrounding the umbra, where a
significant part of the total magnetic flux is carried ( Schmidt , 1991
; Thomas & Weiss , 1992 ) . The penumbra is seen in continuum images as
radial alternating bright and dark filaments (e.g. Collados, del Toro
Iniesta & Vázquez , 1988 ) and exhibits an intermediate brightness
between the umbra and the quiet photosphere (see also the reviews by del
Toro Iniesta , 2001 ; Solanki , 2003 ) . Figure 3.2 shows some high
resolution images taken with the SST in La Palma, where we can see the
intricate filamentary structure of the penumbra and the fine features
inside and around pores.

Magnetic field is in general stronger in the inner part closest to the
umbra and decreases in the outer frontier and its energy radiation is
approximately 75 @xmath the photospheric value. The picture of the fine
structure of the penumbra has not always been the same but evolved
during the last years. Nowadays it is commonly accepted that the
penumbral magnetic field is uncombed so that at least two different
inclinations of the magnetic field coexist on a small scale in a sort of
interlocking structure (see Figure 3.3 ).

The main two distinct inclinations correspond to the component where the
magnetic field is tilted by @xmath 40-50 degrees (with respect to the
vertical to the solar surface) with a strength of @xmath 2000 G, and the
component in which the magnetic field is almost horizontal and weaker (
Lites et al , 1993 ) . Vertical magnetic inclinations were first
associated to bright filaments whereas the more horizontal ones to dark
filaments though nowadays this picture has changed significantly since
the discovery of two narrow lateral brightenings located at each side of
the central obscuration, as will be commented below.

Recent works using high-resolution images have improved the measurements
of the field inclination in the penumbral filaments ( Bello et al , 2005
; Langhans et al , 2005 ) . Results from full-Stokes profiles have
confirmed and firmly established that variations of inclination and
field strength are indeed present in sunspot penumbrae, and moreover
they are anti-correlated: the less inclined components (known as spines
) have stronger magnetic field than the more horizontal ones (know as
intraspines , Lites et al , 1993 ) . In the intraspines, some flux tubes
(collection of multiple magnetic field lines) overtake the external
penumbral border ( Sainz Dalda & Martínez Pillet , 2005 ) whereas some
other immerse below the surface due to the turbulent effect of the
granular convection pushing them downwards ( Westendorp Plaza et al. ,
1997 ; Thomas et al , 2002 ) . We will come back again to this topic.

Although many unknowns have been unveiled, there are still many
fundamental and unanswered questions such as why sunspots have a
penumbra and how it is maintained for a few days before it disappears. A
lot of internal structure has been resolved in penumbral filaments and
they seem to be composed by a dark core accompanied by a bright halo at
both sides. This new features named dark-cored penumbral filaments,
recently discovered by Scharmer et al. ( 2002 ) , have brought great
interest as they can unveil the very fundamental influence of
magnetoconvection at small scales occurring in sunspot penumbrae. At the
beginning of the filament, the dark core is not present and the lateral
brightenings merge into a larger bright structure known as penumbral
grains (PG) that seems to move radially in the penumbra.

Several authors have worked on this new observational evidence to
investigate on the fine structure of the penumbra and nowadays there
some models of the penumbral fine structure trying to explain all
diverse phenomena. Firsly, the most mentioned and confronted one, the
uncombed model proposed by Solanki & Montavon ( 2003 ) in which the
penumbra is seen as a collection of horizontal flux tubes embedded in an
almost vertical and strong background magnetic field. Numerical
simulations of the temporal evolution of flux tubes (the moving-tube
model of Schlichenmaier, Jahn & Schmidt , 1998a , b ) have modelled them
starting at the magnetopause, then rising adiabatically as a result of
radiative heating, by magnetic buoyancy, and eventually being bent into
the horizontal where they cool down due to radiative losses while
continue outward from the center of the spot. Recently, some new
observational and theoretical works support the uncombed model ¹ ¹ 1
Also known as embedded flux tube model. (e.g. Müller et al , 2002 ;
Bellot Rubio et al. , 2003 ; Borrero et al , 2005 ; Bellot Rubio et al ,
2007 ; Jurčák & Bellot Rubio , 2008 ; Ruiz Cobo & Bellot Rubio , 2008 )
. A second model has been proposed by Spruit & Scharmer ( 2006 ) , the
so-called gappy penumbral model (see also Scharmer & Spruit , 2006 ) .
These authors interpret the penumbral filaments as due to convection in
field-free, radially aligned gaps below the surface of the penumbra and
argue that this solves the discrepancy between the large heat flux and
the low velocities present in penumbra or, in other words, that their
model can explain the heating of the penumbra. Apart from these two
models, alternative ones have come out on the scene based on
MIcro-Structured Magnetic Atmosphere (MISMA, Sánchez Almeida , 1998 ,
2005 ) . These models assume that the penumbra is formed by optically
thin magnetic fibrils a few km in diameter and moreover that every
resolution element contains a bunch of unorganized field lines with
random strengths and inclinations. In general, all models have some
problems (see Bellot Rubio , 2007 ) and the debate is not sealed yet.

New features and fine-scale structures have been recently observed
thanks to the improvements in the real-time and post-facto correction of
the images. It is likely that inside dark cores there is more unseen
fine structure. This new structures will add more ingredients to this
already complicated scenario.

The penumbra not only shows an intricate magnetic structure but also a
complex dynamics. The PGs for instance, are moving in two privileged
directions, radially towards the umbra in the inner penumbra with
velocities of the order of 500 m s @xmath ( Muller , 1976 ) and towards
the surrounding photosphere in the outer penumbra ( Sobotka et al. ,
1999 ; Sobotka & Sütterlin , 2001 ) . The line dividing both distinct
directions of movement is placed at a distance from the outer penumbral
border of about one third of the total penumbra longitude. Some of the
PGs cross the penumbra-photosphere boundary and continue to move in the
granulation as small bright features ( Bonet et al. , 2004 ) .

Apart from the radial proper motions of PGs, Márquez, Sánchez-Almeida &
Bonet ( 2006 ) find, by using local correlation tracking techniques,
that radial motions diverge away from bright filaments to converge
toward dark filaments, leading to an association between downflows and
dark features that could be a sign of convection in penumbra. This
result is reinforced by Sánchez Almeida et al. ( 2007 ) on the basis of
spectroscopic measurements, with high-angular resolution, of the
Evershed effect (see next section).

##### 3.4.3 Evershed flow

The Evershed Flow (hereafter EF) is associated to an observational
effect in the penumbra registered as a global wavelength shift for
spectral lines forming in the penumbra of sunspots. There are actually
two kinds of EF registered: 1) the normal EF at photospheric level where
blueshifts are observed in the penumbra on the sunspot side close to the
solar disc center whereas redshifts are detected on the sunspot side
towards the solar limb. It corresponds to mainly radial and horizontal
flows traveling in the penumbra of the sunspots towards the external
photosphere; 2) at chromospheric level, the so-called inverse EF, where
the material flows towards the umbra, contrary to the normal EF and much
less studied so far. From here forth, we will focus on the normal EF.

This effect was first observed by Evershed in 1909 ( Evershed , 1909 )
at Kodaikanal Observatory in India and is interpreted as a Doppler
shifting caused by the radial and predominantly horizontal flow along
the penumbra. The EF has been interpreted as a siphon flow along
magnetic flux tubes ( Meyer & Schmidt , 1968 ; Thomas , 1988 ) .

There have been several studies trying to explain the properties and
nature of the EF in the last forty years (e.g. Haugen , 1969 ; Maltby ,
1975 ; Moore , 1981 ; Dialetis, Mein & Alissandrakis , 1985 ; Dere,
Schmieder & Alissandrakis , 1990 ) . For a very recent review the reader
is referred to the work by Bellot Rubio ( 2007 ) .

In more recent studies and helped by high-resolution observations, it
has been confirmed that there is a strong correlation between the EF and
the horizontal magnetic fields in the penumbra. It is the expected
behavior as resulted from magnetohydrodynamical considerations that
require for the flow to be aligned respect to the magnetic field lines (
Bellot Rubio et al. , 2003 ) . Rimmele ( 1995 ) found that the EF is
confined in thin channels which elevate upon the continuum level over
the vast majority of the penumbra. The last result has been afterwards
confirmed in different observations. It has also been found that some of
these channels and their associated field lines re-enter the solar
surface in the outermost part of the penumbra and beyond ( Westendorp
Plaza et al. , 1997 ; Schlichenmaier & Schmidt , 2000 ) . Some recent
results indicate that the EF does not end abruptly at the white-light
sunspot boundary, but that at least part of it continues beyond the
visible boundary and forms an extensive magnetic canopy (e.g. Solanki,
Montavon & Livingston , 1994 ; Rezaei et al , 2006 ) . The existence of
radial outflow in the sunspot canopy is still an ongoing debate.

#### 3.5 Photosphere surrounding sunspots

Sunspots are immersed in the convective plasma as mentioned above, and
this plasma is observed mainly as granulation. Granulation is the first
pattern that can be identified when looking at the solar photosphere and
covers the vast majority of its surface. Figure 3.4 shows the underneath
convective pattern mechanism forming the granulation that we see on the
photospheric layer. In the inter-granular lanes we can detect the
presence of magnetic flux coming from below, sometimes visible as bright
and elongated structures as shown in the high-spatial resolution image
in Figure 3.4 .

The granulation convective pattern surrounding sunspots is perturbed by
the presence of magnetic elements that move radially outwards through an
annular cell called the ”moat”. Next sections comment on the physical
properties of these magnetic structures and on the plasma flows around
sunspots.

##### 3.5.1 Moving Magnetic Features

The Moving Magnetic Features (MMFs) are bright features that correspond
to small magnetic elements of mixed polarity traveling radially outwards
while immersed in the granulation surrounding sunspots ( Sheeley , 1972
; Harvey & Harvey , 1973 ; Hagenaar & Shine , 2005 , for a recent
review) . These features move with velocities of some hundredths of
meters per second up to 3 km s @xmath and can be generally classified in
three main groups, as follows:

-    Type I: Bipolar pairs of magnetic elements moving together outwards
    the sunspot inside the moat, with velocities in a range between 0.5
    a 1 km s @xmath . They appear just outside the penumbra along
    directions that are extensions of the dark penumbral filaments.
    These bipolar pairs are interpreted as being footpoints of a loop
    emerging to the solar surface belonging to a penumbral flux tube in
    which there is a strong vertical convection. The loop is then swept
    away by the moat flow. Several loops can emerge in different
    positions and different times along the same flux tube and this
    mechanism is seen when successive MMF Type I tend to follow similar
    trajectories across the moat region. As long as the flux tube is
    attached to the sunspot, this type of MMFs associated to the tube
    are not responsible for the sunspot decay. Figure 3.5 shows the
    diverse interpretations of bipolar type I MMFs ( Yurchyshyn et al ,
    2001 ; Wilson , 1973 ; Harvey & Harvey , 1973 ) .

-    Type II: Consist of unipolar magnetic elements with the same
    polarity as the parent sunspot that are shed from the sunspot
    border, moving across the moat with velocities of 2 and 3 km s
    @xmath . They are interpreted to be flux tubes that have been
    separated from the main flux and are dragged by the moat. The loss
    of flux represented by this features is a possible mechanism
    involved in the sunspot decay ( Hagenaar & Shine , 2005 ) .
    Nevertheless, further investigations should be done to know whether
    or not this type of MMFs is more common in rapidly decaying
    sunspots.

-    Type III: The last type of MMFs are also unipolar features but in
    this case with magnetic polarity opposite to that of the parent
    sunspot, having high velocities in a range similar to that of the
    Type II. They are more transitory than the first two types and
    travel outward a few thousand km before disappearing, and are
    thought to be produced when a flux tube section emerges to the
    surface generating a rapid horizontal displacement of the footpoints
    in the moat.

##### 3.5.2 Moat flow

The existence of an annular region around sunspots was first reported by
Sheeley ( 1969 ) who termed it moat . Radially oriented outflows in
moats were found by Sheeley & Bhatnagar ( 1971 ) .

The sunspot moat defines an organized horizontal flow pattern that ends
quite abruptly at a distance that can be comparable to supergranular
sizes or even larger. Sheeley ( 1972 ) reported Doppler speed of these
outflows 0.5 - 1.0 km s @xmath for distances 10-20 Mm beyond the outer
boundary of the sunspot. Brickhouse & Labonte ( 1988 ) performed a study
of the properties of moats and concluded that the moat radius is roughly
proportional to the penumbral radius.

The characteristics and temporal evolution of moats derived at two
heights in the atmosphere for a large sample of sunspots with different
sizes, shapes and evolutionary stages have been recently studied by
Sobotka & Roudier ( 2007 ) . These authors establish a relation between
sunspot types and their occurrence, areas, and horizontal velocities of
the moats in the photosphere and in the transition region and found that
moats do not show substantial changes for periods of about 12 hours.
Table 3.1 lists the averaged horizontal velocities inside and outside
the moat for young and old spots and Figures 3.6 and 3.7 show plots (for
young and old spots) of the maximum moat radius versus the sunspot
radius, and the average azimuthal distribution of the the moat area and
velocities respectively.

Bonet et al. ( 2005 ) have found that MMFs in the moats are mostly
located in radially oriented channels between the local divergent
motions of mesogranular scale. This motions confine the MMFs within the
channels. They also found that most MMFs move passively with the same
average speeds as the neighbouring granules, that is, they are carried
along by the same large-scale moat flows as the granules. However, a
small fraction of them (6%) move away from the spot more rapidly (they
reach velocities grater than 1.4 km s @xmath ) than the neighbouring
granules which can be interpreted as the consequence of interactions
with fast moving small granular fronts or fragments.

New findings ( Sainz Dalda & Martínez Pillet , 2005 ) have shown that
the penumbral filaments extend beyond the sunspot boundary entering the
region dominated by the moat flow where the MMF activity is detected.
Thus, the temporal average of magnetograms has unveiled the existence of
moat filaments: horizontal, filamentary structures coming from the
penumbra and reaching the photospheric network as an extension of the
penumbral filaments. Moreover, some MMF have been found ( Sainz Dalda &
Martínez Pillet , 2005 ; Ravindra , 2006 ; Cabrera Solana et al. , 2006
) starting just inside the outer penumbral boundary in its way out from
the sunspot (see Figures 3.8 and 3.9 ). Kubo et al. ( 2007 ) have
recently established a relationship between the vertical component
(spines) of the magnetic field in the so-called uncombed structure of
the penumbra (section § 3.4.2 ) and MMFs (with the same polarity as the
sunspot) observed in the moat regions.

### Chapter 4 Proper motions in a complex active region \dropping

[0pt]2This chapter is the first one devoted to the analysis of solar
observations, showing the results from the application of the image
restoration process commented in the former part of the thesis. The
study is based on ground-based observations of a complex @xmath
-configuration solar active region in which we performed a detailed
analysis of proper motions at photospheric level describing the dynamics
of the plasma in the FOV. Some results presented in this chapter are an
extensive version of Vargas Domínguez et al. ( 2007 ) .

#### 4.1 Introduction

Sunspots that contain umbrae of opposite magnetic polarity within a
single penumbrae are known as @xmath -configuration sunspots. They are
complex active regions that usually evolve rapidly and are likely to
produce energetic solar flares ( Zirin & Wang , 1989 ) . The present
chapter is based on an excellent @xmath 79 minutes time series of a
sunspot group with a @xmath -configuration. The long duration of the
series, besides the high and stable quality throughout the entire
period, substantially improved after image reconstruction, make of this
material an excellent data set to study morphology and dynamical
behavior of sunspots and their surroundings. We are interested here in
the relation between the existence of penumbra in this active region and
the dynamics of the convective plasma surrounding it. The proper motions
inside penumbrae are also analyzed and a statistical study between the
different regions over the FOV is performed.

#### 4.2 Observations

The first observing campaign I was involved in at the Swedish 1 m Solar
Telescope (SST ¹ ¹ 1 The SST is operated by the Institute for Solar
Physics (ISP) of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences at the Roque de
los Muchachos Observatory in La Palma, Canary Islands. , Scharmer et al.
, 2003a ) corresponding to the so-called Spanish Time ² ² 2 The Spanish
Time corresponds to the 20% of the total observing time at the
Observatories of the Canary Islands, assigned to Spain by the
institutions the telescopes belongs to, by virtue of the International
Agreements on Cooperation in Astrophysics . , was held in April 2004.
During this campaign I was particularly interested on becoming familiar
with the instrumentation, software and observing techniques that have
been in constant evolution and development in recent years. Moreover,
the observed images were used to test the restoration algorithms (see
chapter §1).

The second observing campaign was held at the SST in July 2005 and
corresponded to the so-called International Time Program (ITP) ³ ³ 3
Period corresponding to the 5% of the total observing time (see previous
footnote), aimed to promote astrophysical research in cooperation with
various telescopes and institutions. . In this framework, several
Japanese scientists came to the Canary Observatories ⁴ ⁴ 4 Observatorio
del Teide (OT) in Tenerife and Observatorio Roque de los Muchachos (ORM)
in La Palma. for a joint programme of simultaneous observations using
various solar telescopes: the Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT), the Solar
Swedish Telescope (SST), the Dutch Open Telescope (DOT), and the
satellites Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) and Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The observations were focused on
targets displaying solar active regions and, in particular, regions
inside and around sunspots where various magnetic features (e.g. MMFs,
see section §3.4) are widely observed. The SST and the DOT were devoted
to imaging, pursuing observations of the photosphere and chromosphere
with high -spatial and -temporal resolutions. The main objective of
these coordinated observations was to figure out what kind of magnetic
features in the photosphere/chromosphere are responsible for
quasi-steady heating and enhanced activities well observed in the active
corona.

##### 4.2.1 Instrumentation and setup

The work and results presented in all this chapter are based on the
observations done at the SST (during the ITP collaboration, see Figure
4.1 ), using the adaptive optics (AO) system. The AO system has a
bi-morph mirror equipped with 37 electrodes and a Shack-Hartmann
wavefront sensor with 37 microlenses. A thin-film filter (dichroic
filter) separates the light in two beams,the blue and the red beams. The
blue beam for imaging and the red one to feed a longitudinal
magnetograph (the SOUP Tunable Filter that will be described in detail
later on). Table 4.1 enumerates the main characteristics of the
telescope.

In order to apply the restoration techniques described in chapter §1 we
recorded two objects : images in G-band ⁵ ⁵ 5 Spectral band of molecular
lines at @xmath 430.5 nm. and G-cont ⁶ ⁶ 6 Relatively clear continuum,
close to the G-band, at @xmath 436.3 nm. . The setup included then, for
the blue beam, two channels taking simultaneous images. In the first
channel, G-cont ( @xmath 436.3 nm, FWHM=1.15 nm), two Kodak Megaplus 1.6
CCD cameras with a 10-bits dynamical range and 1536 @xmath 1024 pixels
were employed, as corresponding to the PD focus-defocus image-pair. The
defocus image was generated by moving backwards the camera a certain
distance to generate a larger optical path in comparison to the focus
one, hence inducing a known amount of defocus. The second channel was
devoted to G-band ( @xmath 430.5 nm, FWHM=1.08 nm). The pixel size of
the cameras was 0 041 square.

Apart from the two above described, a third independent channel
(asynchronous respect to G-band and G-cont) was acquiring reference
images in the Ca II H line ( @xmath 396.9 nm, FWHM=0.3 nm). Table 4.2
groups the main characteristics for the blue channel.

Figure 4.2 shows the setup with all the optical elements used in the
configuration we mounted for the campaign. The optical paths and
instruments employed by the adaptive optics system are drawn in red in
the figure. On the right-hand side, the blue beam includes the PD
image-pair (G-cont), the G-band channel (synchronized with G-cont by
means of a chopper ) and the independent Ca II H channel.

The Solar Optical Universal Polarimeter (SOUP, Title et al , 1986 )
tunable filter, owned by the Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics
Laboratory (LMSAL), was placed along the red beam. This instrument is
essentially a temperature compensated Lyot filter. It operates by
rotating a series of linear polarizers and 1/2-wave retarders placed
between calcite crystal optics. The selected wavelength is adjusted by
tuning the servo motors for each rotating element to a previously
calibrated position. Two bandpass modes, wide ( @xmath 100 mÅ) and
narrow ( @xmath 100 mÅ), are selectable for any given line tuning. The
complete configuration of the SOUP also includes two Liquid Crystal
Variable Retarders (LCVRs) for measuring the polarization state of the
incoming light. The SOUP filter is used for observations in the H @xmath
spectral line that forms in the solar chromosphere and to obtain
magnetograms using the magnetically sensitive line Fe I 6302 Å.

A beam splitter in front of the SOUP divides the light beam to obtain
simultaneous images in the continuum near the selected bandwidth. These
images, understood as additional objects , will help us to restore the
narrow band images (by MOMFBD) and to obtain high-resolution
magnetograms.

Figure 4.3 shows the SOUP ( left ) and the science high-resolution
cameras of the blue beam ( right ) as placed on the optical bench at the
SST ⁷ ⁷ 7 The complete description of the instrumentation and the
manuals of operation of the SST can be found in the website
http://www.solarphysics.kva.se/LaPalma/ .

##### 4.2.2 Data acquisition

During the period 3-13 July 2005, images were acquired as listed in
Table 4.3 . The weather conditions at the observatory through all the
campaign were quite variable obtaining rather medium quality images
though for the observing run on July 9 we were able to record very good
images (close to the diffraction limit after restoration) due to an
excellent seeing.

Our targets of interest were sunspots in different evolutionary stages
close to the solar disc center both, leaders and followers. Within all
the images recorded, a post-facto pre-selection was made in order to get
rid of the data below a certain quality threshold. The quality of the
images is quantified by averaging the local gradients in absolute value
inside a granulation window within the FOV. The quality was measured by
using the G-band images as reference. Figure 4.4 shows a plot of the
quality for the G-band images through the entire observation on July 9,
2005.

Among all the acquired data, we decided to work with the best quality
images that corresponded to the NOAA Active Region 10786 observed on
July 9, 2005. This complex region, displaying a @xmath -configuration,
was placed at heliocentric position @xmath 0.9 as shown in the SOHO
full-disk continuum image in Figure 4.5 . The sequences span for more
than one hour, from 7:47 UT to 9:06 UT, following the evolution of the
sunspots.

#### 4.3 Data processing

Real-time corrections with the AO of the telescope and further
post-processing techniques rendered up images near the diffraction
limit. The main steps performed in the processing of the images are
sequentially detailed in the next sections.

##### 4.3.1 Flatfield and darkfield corrections

Standard procedures for flatfielding and dark-current subtraction were
firstly applied. During the observations, apart from the science images,
we also acquired the corresponding flat and dark images ⁸ ⁸ 8 To improve
the SNR, every flat and dark image resulted from real-time averages of
100 single exposures. The flats were taken while the telescope,
out-of-focus, scanned the central area of the solar disc at fast speed.
. The corrections were made by applying the following expression

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the final image after flatfield and dark current
corrections, @xmath is the observed raw image, @xmath and @xmath are the
mean dark and flat images, respectively, and indexes @xmath stand for
the pixel position in the image matrix. Special care has been taken
during these corrections to eliminate dark and hot pixels, and also the
black borders in the flat images, as a crucial step to ensure the images
will not be affected by spurious artifacts when applying the restoration
code.

##### 4.3.2 Restorations

Post-processing for image restoration was performed by employing the
Multi-Object Multi-Frame Blind Deconvolution (MOMFBD) described in
section §1.5. In the blue beam, the observing strategy to apply this
technique consisted in taking G-band images and simultaneous G-cont
phase diversity image-pairs. Sets of about 18 images per channel (i.e. 3
@xmath 18 images) within a temporal cadence of 10.0517 s, were combined
to produce a pair of simultaneous G-band and G-cont restored images.
Table 4.4 shows the information about the images employed in the
restoration process.

Following this procedure, two time series of reconstructed images were
produced: 472 images for each channel, G-band and G-cont, that
correspond to 79 min of continuous solar observation. Figure 4.6
displays an example of the restorations pursued, for one out of the 472
image groups processed. The total FOV in the original non-restored
images was 63 @xmath 42 ” whereas the final FOV in the final restored
images was 60 @xmath 40 ”.

##### 4.3.3 De-stretching and subsonic filtering

Once the images were restored, they were, firstly, de-rotated to
compensate for diurnal field rotation observed in the focal plane,
induced by the alt-azimuthal configuration of the telescope and,
secondly, aligned by cross correlation.

Additional image processing included the so-called de-stretching. The
stretching or distortion effect on the images, commented in
section §1.1, consist on differential local displacements over the FOV.
They are due to differential deviations from the original tilts in the
wavefronts coming from different point sources. Atmospheric turbulence
is the responsible for this problem. The effect is specially strong
during the morning time when the line-of-sight (hereafter LOS) to the
Sun is more inclined hence inducing a greater optical thickness in the
light path and consequently, a larger atmospheric turbulence
contribution.

Thus, the stretching is a local effect manifested with different
strength at different positions over the FOV and can be corrected at
medium- and large-spatial scales by applying local correlation
techniques. The local correlation tracking (LCT) technique was
originally designed for the removal of distortions in image sequences (
November , 1986 ) and later on, was used to infer the proper motions of
the granulation in a time series of white-light images ( November &
Simon , 1988 ) .

Due to the strong distortion present in our time series, the
de-stretching algorithm was applied repeatedly in four subsequent steps,
to completely eliminate residual effects. In every step, the size of the
correlation tracking window was modified from greater to smaller sizes
to ensure corrections at different spatial scales.

Subsonic filtering is the last stage in the corrections applied to the
images and deals with the cleaning process pursued to eliminate high
frequency oscillations, such as the p-modes and residual jitter stemming
from de-stretching, in the frequency @xmath domain ( Title et al , 1986
) . A filter with a phase-velocity threshold of @xmath km s @xmath was
employed with satisfactory results (see Figure 4.7 center ). The sharp
cutoff in the subsonic filter was replaced by a smooth transition from 1
to 0.

An apodization in the temporal dimension (8 @xmath of the total length
at each end) was also applied to minimize border effects in the
filtering process. The final product were two movies (G-band and G-cont)
⁹ ⁹ 9 See the movies at the web site:
http://www.iac.es/galeria/svargas/movies.html of 428 frames each,
spanning over 71 min with a cadence of 10.0517 s, and covering a FOV of
57 8 @xmath 34 4. The time series reached the high-resolution level
shown in Figure 4.7 ( lower central panel ). This quality is pretty much
suitable for subsequent scientific analysis. Figure 4.8 shows the superb
quality achieved in the best image of the time series.

##### 4.3.4 Maps of displacements

The LCT method has been commonly used for determining velocity fields in
time-resolved image data and was first applied by November & Simon (
1988 ) to measure proper-motions in solar granulation. Since then,
different authors have used LCT techniques at many different spatial
scales to study the solar dynamics, such as long-term evolution and
flows in supergranulation ( Shine, Simon & Hurlburt , 2000 ; De Rosa,
Duvall & Toomre , 2000a ) .

The method is based on a simple but powerful idea that works on the
principle of finding local concordances between two frames (images). A
correlation window selects corresponding sub-areas in both images (the
patches to be correlated). The selected sub-areas include those
structures we want to track, such as solar granules that evolve in time.
The displacement vector is given by the difference of the coordinates of
the sub-area centers when the best match between them is found.
Mathematically this idea is expressed in terms of a correlation function
between two instants.

The selection of the sub-areas is performed by means of a window which
is usually set to be a Gaussian function with a Full-Width at Half
Maximum (FWHM) adapted to the desired size for the correlation patch and
depending on the spatial-scale of the structures we are about to track.

It is well documented in the literature that LCT-techniques in general
produce some systematic errors in the determination of displacements.
The nature of the interpolation algorithm to fix the position of the
correlation maximum with sub-pixel accuracy may play a role in the
results. The LCT-method typically underestimate the velocity fields.
Tests performed by the authors of the LCT-code we are employing in this
work lead to conclude that in the worst cases this underestimation can
amount to 20-30 % ( Yi , 1992 ; Molowny-Horas , 1994 ) .

Figure 4.9 , taken from November & Simon ( 1988 ) , displays a plot of
the precision of the displacement measurements by means of LCT and using
a quadratic interpolation formulae to determine the correlation maximum.
These authors have used solar granulation images recorded on
photographic film support, digitized at 12 positions with increments of
0.1 pixel. Then, they have computed displacement maps by comparison with
the unshifted image applying their LCT algorithm. Figure 4.9 shows the
ratio between the computed and the real displacements. The former being
the average of displacements over the area of each displacement map with
error bars representing @xmath .

##### 4.3.5 Magnetograms

In the red beam, the SOUP tunable birefringent filter working at Fe I
6302Å in combination with a modulator composed by liquid crystal
retarders, produced longitudinal magnetograms as mentioned above. The
SOUP filter recorded images in the two flanks of the line at @xmath 50
mÅ  from its core. The modulator switched between two states to obtain
10 left and 10 right circular polarization states (LCP and RCP) at each
line position. The total time required to record all four-type images
was 33 s. A beamsplitter in front of the SOUP filter deflected 10% of
the light to obtain broad-band phase diversity image-pairs, that
combined with the narrow-band images of the SOUP allowed MOMFBD
reconstructions. The MOMFBD restoration was therefore performed from
subsets of 40 SOUP images including all polarization states and line
positions, and 40 simultaneously recorded wide-band PD image-pairs, that
is, a total of 120 images to produce 5 restored ones: @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath . Magnetograms (M) and also Dopplergrams (D)
can be generated from the saved restored images by means of the
following expressions

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

The Doppler velocity @xmath is given by: @xmath , where @xmath is a
constant to convert Doppler signal to Doppler velocities and is
estimated to be @xmath km s @xmath by comparing the Doppler signal with
the mean LOS Doppler velocity of granules ( @xmath km s @xmath ). The
FOV of the restored SOUP images is @xmath (with a pixel size of 0 061
pixel @xmath ). Figure 4.10 displays one of the resulting magnetograms
having a spatial resolution of about 0 2.

#### 4.4 Results

##### 4.4.1 General description of proper motions

The G-band series was employed to study the proper motions of the
structures in the FOV by using a LCT algorithm implemented by
Molowny-Horas & Yi ( 1994 ) . For our analysis, we have preferably
chosen a Gaussian tracking window with FWHM 0 78 being half of the
typical granular size, which is suitable for tracking mainly granules.

With this code we obtained two maps of horizontal displacements or
proper motions per time step (i.e. the horizontal velocity components
@xmath and @xmath ), which were averaged in time. Averages of horizontal
velocity components were performed over 5-min and 71-min intervals.

Figure 4.11 shows the resulting flow map averaged over the whole series
(71 min). Moat flows are seen in the spot on the lower left of the FOV
but more prominently in the spot on the right side in the upper and
lower penumbral regions (moats flows will be treated in more detail in
section 4.4.2 ). Several centers of diverging horizontal motions are
present in the entire FOV. Some of them surround sunspots (lower left
and right sides of the figure) but the most conspicuous ones are seen in
the lesser magnetized area (lower part of the FOV between the spots),
displaying greater velocities and more symmetrical shapes. These
velocity structures, related to recurrent expansion and splitting of
granules, are commonly associated with mesogranulation ( Roudier et al.
, 2003 ; Roudier & Muller , 2004 ; Bonet et al. , 2005 ) .

The white lines in Figure 4.11 delineate the LOS neutral lines inferred
from a SOUP magnetogram (see Figure 4.10 ). The regions crossed by these
lines correspond naturally to horizontal fields, similar to those found
in penumbrae. However, we caution that these horizontal fields can have
different flows as those that occur in normal penumbra (such as shear
flows, as found by Deng et al. ( 2006 ) or the supersonic nozzles
observed by Martínez Pillet et al. ( 1994 ) . Close inspection also
shows that areas near neutral lines have a filamentary appearance that
is much less distinct than observed in normal penumbrae extending
radially from umbral cores.

We measured a mean speed in the granulation outside the moats of @xmath
0.35 km s @xmath . This small value reflects the presence of high
magnetic signal (dense population of pores and G-band bright points all
over the field), however, it is even smaller than the reported, also for
magnetized granulation, by other authors that employ tracking windows of
similar widths ( Berger et al. , 1998 ; Bonet et al. , 2005 ) .

The region in between the left and right hand side sunspots in the
active region under study is indeed a plage region of abnormal granules
full of magnetic activity as revealed by Ishikawa et al. ( 2007 ) .
Figure 4.12 shows the results from these authors working with the
central region of the FOV (in an upside-down position respect to the one
shown in Figure 4.11 ). The G-band image shows a large amount of bright
structures that are selected and marked in white (see Figure 4.12 center
). These G-band bright points are ubiquitously distributed over the
whole plage region and point out the intense magnetic activity in this
so-called magnetized granulation. The corresponding magnetogram (see
Figure 4.12 right ) also reveals the magnetic polarities behavior and
intense activity in the same region.

Inside penumbrae the proper motions were studied to infer the systematic
directions of the flows. Figure 4.13 shows, with enlarged velocity
scale, the proper motions inside penumbra using a tracking window FWHM=
0 78 and averaging over 71 minutes. These displacements do not
necessarily correspond to real motions of plasma but could reflect
displacements of brightness. We are aware that the tracking window used
allows us to determine only averaged displacements of the penumbral fine
features, however, the description of the proper motions of this
features is out of the scope of the present work. Figure 4.13 reveals
mean flows at spatial resolution of @xmath 1 @xmath (mean velocity
@xmath 0.4 km s @xmath ), moving toward the umbra in the inner penumbra
and toward the surrounding granulation in the outer penumbra. The
filamentary like structures in grey, mapping small horizontal velocities
( @xmath 0.13 km s @xmath ), outline the frontiers separating both kinds
of flow. This clear division of the velocities field in two quite
differentiable tendencies has already been mentioned by some authors
(see Bonet et al. , 2004 ) but not in a systematically way inside
sunspots in a complex active region as presented in this work.

In order to perform a statistical study of horizontal velocities, a
sequence of 14 velocity maps was obtained averaging over 5-min windows
along the whole series. As expected, the resulting maps are a little
more noisy but with a wider range of variation of the speeds
(i.e. velocity magnitudes) as compared with the case of averaging over
71 min. Figure 4.14 shows the histogram of the speeds as measured in
this sequence of maps, for different regions within the FOV: penumbral
areas, granulation outside the moats and moat regions (see also Table
4.5 for mean and rms values). Note that the moat histogram in the Figure
4.14 shows a cutoff imposed by the lower threshold selected to define
moat velocities.

The statistical analysis of the results (Figure 4.14 and Table 4.5)
renders a value for the mean speed in the moats of @xmath 0.67 km s
@xmath , similar to that reported by Bonet et al. ( 2005 ) , that is
almost twice the mean value in the rest of the granulation field. The
confinement of such significantly higher speeds in restricted areas
close to the sunspots makes moats a sharply differentiated structure in
the photospheric granulation.

We pursued the same statistical calculations for velocity maps computed
with a tracking window with FWHM 0 2. The results revealed that when
reducing the size of the tracking window, the measured mean and rms
speed values increment since we are also including small structures, as
bright points, moving faster than the general flows observed in the
granulation pattern evolution. In our experiment, for instance, the
difference between the mean and rms values is about twofold when going
from FWHM 0 78 to 0 2.

##### 4.4.2 Large-scale horizontal granular flows

To study the proper motions surrounding the sunspots and in particular
the behavior of the large-scale flows in the FOV, a velocity threshold
can be selected to only plot a given range. The map in Figure 4.15 shows
only those velocities in the granulation field with magnitude above 0.4
km s @xmath . Strong radial outflows (moats) are evident surrounding the
sunspots and 0.4 km s @xmath appears to be a characteristic speed value
to define the moats. The black contours in the figure outline the area
of the moats. It was drawn by hand following visual criteria of
proximity to the sunspot and avoiding a few strong exploding events at
the lower part of the FOV that contaminate the large-scale moat flow.
Empty areas in the moat region in the velocity maps are a result of the
chosen value for the speed threshold and correspond to the interaction
with exploding events that occur inside the moat.

From inspection of Figure 4.15 , it becomes evident that the moats are
closely associated with the presence of a penumbra. The examples in the
lower left, lower right and upper right corners are quite revealing. The
right pointed velocity vectors on the lower left corner correspond to
the moat flow of a penumbra that is not visible in the FOV of this
figure, but can be seen in an image covering a wider FOV, of the same
active region in Figure 4.16 . Moats are missing in the sunspot sides
with no penumbral structure. This is readily seen in the right side of
the umbral core at coordinates (9,10), but also in the left side of the
one at (25,18). None of the pores in the middle of the FOV is associated
with any moat-like flow. More importantly, moats are also absent in
granulation regions that are located side by side with a penumbra, but
in the direction perpendicular to that marked by the penumbral
filaments. A clear example is the region around coordinates (9,6-7) in
Figure 4.15 . As a normal (meaning here far from the neutral line)
penumbra, it is a candidate to develop a moat flow, but none is seen in
this region. The moat flow only appears along the direction delineated
by the penumbral filaments. Moats, thus, appear to be a natural
extension of the flow along the direction of penumbral filaments and do
not exist as outflows in the transverse direction.

##### 4.4.3 Neutral lines affecting the flow behavior

As commented in section § 4.3.5 we produced magnetograms of the FOV by
means of the SOUP filter. The high-resolution magnetogram in Figure 4.10
shows the two polarities. The positive polarities ( in white ) dominate
the left and right areas of the FOV and correspond widely to the
polarities of the respective sunspots. The central area of the image is
dominated by a negative polarity ( in black ). Two neutral lines can be
then identified separating opposite polarities. These neutral lines are
also overplotted in the magnetogram, dopplergram and white-light image
taken by the DOT during the same observing run but with a wider FOV (see
Figure 4.16 ).

It is seen that when the neutral lines run close to a penumbral border
and parallel to it, the expected behavior of the outflows in the
granulation region side by side with that penumbra changes somehow and
the moats do not appear in those regions. The penumbral region in Figure
4.15 , centered at coordinates (5,20), does not show clear evidence of a
moat flow (although localized outflows are seen above and below it).
This region corresponds to a strongly sheared neutral line (see Figure
4.11 ) commonly seen in @xmath spots ( Deng et al. , 2006 ) . In the
SOUP magnetogram (Figure 4.10 ) the spot centered on the left side of
the FOV ( white polarity ) does not show a radially outward directed
penumbra, but penumbral filaments that run parallel to the neutral line.
This is a configuration commonly referred as sheared. This configuration
is also inferred from the filaments observed in the G-band frames. We
suspect that both conditions, the presence of a neutral line and the
absence of radially oriented filaments, are responsible for the absence
of a clearly developed moat flow.

The nature of neutral lines with sheared configurations in @xmath -spots
is not well understood. But we stress that if they correspond to
relatively shallow structures, they would also block the upward
propagation of heat and should be able to generate a moat flow. Such a
moat flow is not observed in this sunspot.

##### 4.4.4 Motions of centers of divergence

Following November & Simon ( 1988 ) , (see also Márquez, Sánchez-Almeida
& Bonet , 2006 ) , the divergences and the vertical velocities can be
calculated from the horizontal velocities, according to the expression

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath 150 km stands for the scale height of the flux of mass and
@xmath the divergence of the horizontal velocity field.

For this purpose, we generated four horizontal velocity maps (Gaussian
tracking window of FMWH= 0 78) averaging over time windows of 5, 15, 40
and 70 min, and starting from the beginning of the time series. From
these maps we obtained the divergences and the corresponding vertical
velocities. Since we were not interested in describing details but only
general trends in the granulation vertical flows, the resulting @xmath
maps were smoothed by convolving with a Gaussian running window of
FWHM=1 47, so that the identification of coherent structures was
facilitated. Figure 4.17 displays the resulting four vertical velocity
maps as images representing the velocity magnitudes by using a
pseudocolor scale. Structures corresponding to positive divergences
(i.e. recurrent exploding granules) and sinks with negative divergences
are coherently distributed all over the FOV for all the different
temporal averages though an evident evolution can be noticed between
these averages. The figure shows extreme cases for both positive
divergences at coordinates (30,0) in dark red , and sinks in the upper
right part of the image in blue .

For the particular case of 5-min horizontal velocity averages we
computed 14 of these maps covering the whole time series (70 min), thus
deriving 14 vertical velocity maps similar to the one in the upper left
corner in Figure 4.17 . Figure 4.18 shows the histogram of vertical
velocities as calculated from these 14 maps, that shows a
quasi-symmetric behavior around the mean value ( @xmath 0).

The divergence structures displace in time dragged by flows at scales
larger than the mesogranular ones. In order to follow the evolution of
the centers of divergence along the time series, we employed the same 14
vertical velocity maps described in the previous paragraph ¹⁰ ¹⁰ 10 For
the purpose we are interested here, the distinction between vertical
velocity maps and divergence maps is irrelevant since both quantities
only differ by a constant factor @xmath . . Then, by applying the LCT
again but this time upon the sequence of 14 images of divergence, we can
determine how the centers of divergence displace in time. Because of the
larger size of the structures we want to track, the correlation tracking
window was set to FWHM 3 .

Figure 4.19 displays the resulting map corresponding to the averaged
velocities of the centers of divergence during the whole time series (70
min). The velocities inside sunspots and pores are set to zero since we
are only interested in the granulation proper motions. Figure 4.19
reveals the smooth character of the flow transporting the centers of
divergence; the flows are more organized and uniform as compared with
those in Figure 4.11 but they still preserve signatures of mesogranular
flows. The well-organized moat flows are also clearly defined in the
figure as they were in Figure 4.11 . Note that the scales employed to
represent the velocity vectors in Figures 4.19 and 4.11 are quite
different so that the velocities displayed in the former are much lower
than those represented in Figure 4.11 .

##### 4.4.5 Study of convective cells

Using the map of averaged velocities calculated in section § 4.3.4 from
the 428 images conforming the time series (Figure 4.11 ), we can study
the evolution (displacement) of passive corks homogeneously distributed
in the FOV at time equal zero, one per pixel. By applying the mentioned
averaged velocity field to the spread corks we can follow the
displacement of every single cork in time steps of 10.0517 s. With this
procedure, a sequence of images showing the locations of corks in every
moment can be generated. Figure 4.20 displays the position of corks (in
white ) within the FOV after 0, 22, 45, 67, 89, 111, 134 and 156 minutes
respectively. It is important to differentiate between the sequence of
428 solar images conforming the time series and the sequence of images
showing the evolution of the corks.

This evolution can be extended to times longer than the total duration
of the series (71 min). This is done by assuming the same map of
velocities affecting the corks, as shown in the last 4 panels of Figure
4.20 .

Some properties concerning the displacement of corks in the FOV can be
inferred from Figure 4.20 . Regions having stronger horizontal
velocities are quicker emptied and correspond to the large-scale flows
(moats) presented in Figure 4.15 . After 22 minutes there are evidences
of mesogranulation and exploding granules affecting the displacements of
the corks. Already in minute 45 the mesogranular flows dominate the FOV,
these mesogranules appear as elongated structures when located inside
the moat flows due to the dragging effect. After 67 minutes when the
mean lifetime of mesogranules has been reached or even overtaken, the
mesogranular structures tend to disappear, except in the upper central
part of the FOV where the intense magnetic field confine and limits the
horizontal proper motions of the plasma. A considerable number of corks
are distributed along dark penumbral filaments as pointed out by
Márquez, Sánchez-Almeida & Bonet ( 2006 ) . In the more quiet
granulation regions ( lower central area of the FOV) and in the last
panels of Figure 4.20 the remaining bright structures trace a pattern
resembling supergranular structures which mean lifetime is superior to
the duration of the present sequence.

#### 4.5 Conclusions and discussion

Time series of G-band and G-cont images of a sunspot group with @xmath
-configuration (NOAA active region 10786), spanning over 71 min, were
observed and corrected for atmospheric and instrumental degradation.
Proper motions in the entire FOV have been measured in the G-band series
by means of local correlation tracking techniques. In this chapter, we
concentrate in the results obtained in the identified moat flows (or
lack thereof) of several structures within the FOV. The main conclusions
from the analysis can be summarized as follows:

1) We have identified inside the penumbra frontiers separating mean
longitudinal flows (parallel to the direction of the filaments) at
spatial resolution @xmath 1 @xmath (mean velocity about 0.4 km s @xmath
), moving toward the umbra in the inner penumbra and toward the
surrounding granulation in the outer penumbra.

2) We have detected strong (mean speeds of 0.67 km s @xmath with an rms
of 0.32 km s @xmath ) outflows streaming from penumbrae radially
oriented from an umbral core, the so-called sunspot moats. Our velocity
values are comparable to those reported by i.e, Sheeley ( 1972 ) ,
Vrabec ( 1974 ) , Harvey & Harvey ( 1973 ) , Hagenaar & Shine ( 2005 )
and Bonet et al. ( 2005 ) , which describe the outflow velocities in the
range 0.5 - 1 km s @xmath . Umbral cores sides with no penumbra do not
display moat flows.

3) Furthermore, the moats are also absent on penumbral sides parallel to
the direction defined by the penumbral filaments. They are not found in
directions transverse to them. A special case is sheared penumbral
configurations tangential to the umbral core. No moat flow is found
there either.

This evidence is clearly suggestive of a link between the moat flow and
flows aligned with the penumbral filaments. The possible connection with
the Evershed flow is inescapable. Although it can be argued that a
physical relationship between these two flows is not firmly established
in this chapter, we believe the evidence is clear-cut and that a
statistical analysis of a larger number of regions, as done here, can
establish this connection more solidly. This is one of the goals in the
next chapter, where we extend the sample of solar active regions in
order to consolidate the main conclusions of the present chapter.

##### 4.5.1 Implications of the results

The results in this chapter should be put in the context of the recent
findings by Sainz Dalda & Martínez Pillet ( 2005 ) ; see also Ravindra (
2006 ) mentioned in chapter §3. These authors find that the penumbral
filaments extend beyond the photometric sunspot boundary and cross the
region dominated by the moat flow. This region is also the location
where the MMF activity is normally found. Indeed, some of these MMFs are
seen by these authors to start inside the penumbra. All these results
point to an origin linking the moat flow and MMF activity with the
well-known Evershed flow. Cabrera Solana et al. ( 2006 ) also suggest
that the Evershed clouds inside the penumbrae propagate to the moat,
becoming MMFs once they leave the sunspot. It is indeed somewhat
paradoxical that while the final fate of the Evershed flow has remained
unknown for decades, independent explanations and physical scenarios
have been proposed for the generation of the moat flow (that starts
exactly where the Evershed flow is seen to vanish).

Similarly, the results obtained from local helioseismology near
sunspots, in particular those related to the f-mode ( Gizon et al. ,
2000 ) , are also quite relevant to the results presented here. The
interpretation of these results in terms of convective cells surrounding
sunspots (e.g., Bovelet & Wiehr , 2003 ) may be different if the
Evershed flow turns out to be the major process that injects mass into
the moats surrounding sunspots.

### Chapter 5 Moats flows surrounding sunspots \dropping

[0pt]2This chapter is an extended and more detailed version of the paper
by Vargas Domínguez et al. ( 2008 ) published in the The Astrophysical
Journal (ApJ) . The analysis is performed employing ground-based
observations of solar active regions, and complements the ideas already
presented in the previous chapter concerning the plasma motions at
photospheric level.

#### 5.1 Introduction

The sunspot moat, as previously commented in this thesis, consists of an
organized horizontal radial flow pattern surrounding the sunspots, which
ends quite abruptly at a distance that can be comparable to
supergranular sizes or even larger.

In the last chapter the moat flow in a complex active region was studied
and described in detail. As a result, some conclusions were established
relating these large outflows and certain physical characteristics of
the sunspots: a) No outflow was detected in the granulation next to
umbral cores that lack penumbrae, b) Outflows were only found in the
granulation regions adjacent to the penumbrae in the direction following
the penumbral filaments. c) Granulation regions located next to
penumbral sides parallel to the direction of the filaments show no moat
flow.

The aim of the present chapter is to extend the study done in chapter §
4 to a larger sample of cases, that is, to establish whether this
moat-penumbra relation is systematically found in other active regions
and how the granulation convective pattern surrounding sunspots behaves.

In doing so, we have used several time series of images observed at
high-spatial resolution. A total of 7 different sunspot series have been
processed and analyzed. The sample includes sunspots with different
penumbral configurations, varying from well-developed penumbrae to
rudimentary penumbral morphologies.

#### 5.2 Observations and data processing

The observations were obtained with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope
(SST, Scharmer et al. , 2003a ) on La Palma between 2003 and 2006. All
observations benefited from the use of the SST adaptive optics system (
Scharmer et al. , 2003b ) that minimized the degrading effects of
seeing. Image post-processing techniques were applied to increase the
homogeneity in the quality of the time series and to enhance the image
quality over the whole FOV. For the 2003 data set we applied Multi-Frame
Blind Deconvolution (MFBD) using the implementation developed by Löfdahl
( 2002 ) . The MFBD code was succeeded by the Multi-Object Multi-Frame
Blind Deconvolution code (MOMFBD, Van Noort, Rouppe van der Voort &
Löfdahl ( 2005 ) ) which employs multiple objects and phase-diversity
(see section 1.5 for more details on this method). MOMFBD was applied to
the data sets after 2003. For all the time series we present in this
chapter, the seeing conditions were generally very good and sometimes
excellent, being able to record for more than 40 min in all cases. A
large fraction of the restored images in the different time series
approached the diffraction limit of the telescope.

After image restoration, we applied standard techniques to the time
series including correction for the diurnal field rotation, rigid
alignment and de-stretching to correct for seeing-induced image warping.
A p-modes filtering was also applied to the series (phase-velocity
threshold of 4 km s @xmath ).

Table 5.1 presents details on the different active region targets which
are also shown in Figure 5.1 . The observations were performed in
regions at different positions on the solar disc as listed in the
columns 4 and 5 in Table 5.1 , including one of them (S2) very close to
the limb. Table 5.2 gives some details on the restored time series. The
duration of the time series is in all cases longer than 40 minutes so
that we can use them to get a reliable average of the displacements of
the structures. Below we provide more detailed information on the
different data sets, including the restoration process applied in each
case.

##### 5.2.1 S1: AR440, 22-Aug-2003

An interference filter centered at the continuum at 436.4 nm (FWHM
1.1 nm) was used. In the remainder, this filter will be referred to as
the “G-cont” filter. Every 25 s, the three highest contrast images were
selected and stored to disk. These three images were used for MFBD
processing. This sunspot is shown in Figure 5.1 (S1).

##### 5.2.2 S2: AR608, 10-May-2004

An interference filter centered at the G-band at 430.5 nm (FWHM 1.2 nm)
was used. In the remainder, this filter will be referred to as “G-band”
filter. This observation involved two cameras set-up as a
phase-diversity pair: one in focus and one slightly out of focus. 20
exposures from each camera, acquired over the course of 7.5 seconds,
were used for MOMFBD processing. During processing of the time series, a
few bad quality images, suffering from too much blurring, were dropped.
The exposure time was 11 ms. This sunspot is shown in Figure 5.1 (S2).

##### 5.2.3 S3: AR662, 20-Aug-2004

This time series was observed with the G-cont filter. The MOMFBD
processing was performed using 10 exposures (acquired during 7 s) from a
phase-diversity pair of cameras. For the central part of the FOV,
centered on the sunspot, the MOMFBD processing was extended to involve a
G-band phase-diversity pair of cameras. After MOMFBD restoration, the
best quality image from 3 subsequent images was selected for further
processing of the time series. The exposure time was 11.3 ms. This
sunspot is shown in Figure 5.1 (S3).

##### 5.2.4 S4: AR662, 21-Aug-2004

This time series was processed in a manner similar to S3. After MOMFBD
restorations, the worst 14% of the images were dropped from the time
series. This sunspot is shown in Figure 5.1 (S4).

##### 5.2.5 S5: AR789, 13-Jul-2005

For this time series, MFBD processing was applied to 18 subsequent
G-band images, acquired during 10 s. Images that were too blurred and
when the AO system was not actively compensating, were dropped from the
MFBD sets. This sunspot is shown in Figure 5.1 (S5).

##### 5.2.6 S6: AR813, 4-Oct-2005

This time series was observed with an interference filter centered on
the spectral region between Ca K and Ca H at 395.4 nm (FWHM 1.0 nm). For
the MOMFBD processing, 20 exposures (acquired during 8.3 s) from a
phase-diversity pair of cameras were used. In addition, simultaneous
exposures from two other cameras were used for the restoration: one
equipped with a narrow-band filter centered in the Ca H wing at 396.5 nm
and one equipped with a narrow-band filter centered on the Ca H core
(396.8 nm). The exposure time was 11 ms. This sunspot is shown in Figure
5.1 (S6).

##### 5.2.7 S7: AR893, 10-Jun-2006

This time series was observed with an interference filter centered at
630.2 nm (FWHM 0.8 nm). This is the pre-filter for the Lockheed SOUP
filter. MOMFBD processing was applied to 400 exposures obtained during
19 s. The restorations included images from a phase-diversity pair of
cameras with the wide-band filter, and narrow-band SOUP exposures in the
Fe I 630.2 nm spectral line. This sunspot is shown in Figure 5.1 (S7).

#### 5.3 Data analysis and results

The high quality, stability and long duration of the restored sunspot
series, enable us to study the dynamics of the plasma around the
sunspots. We have computed proper-motion velocity fields (horizontal
velocities) employing the LCT technique described in the previous
chapter. A Gaussian tracking window of FWHM 1 0 suitable for mainly
tracking granules has been used for all the series. The method produces
a sequence of map-pairs each one describing, within a short time
interval (tens of milliseconds), the horizontal velocity components,
@xmath and @xmath , along the FOV. These maps of components have been
averaged over 5 and 10 min periods, and also over the respective total
duration of every sunspot series (more than 40 min in all cases). From
the averaged maps of velocity components, the distribution of velocity
magnitudes over the FOV (flow map) has been easily derived.

As described in section §4.3.4 , it is well documented in the literature
( November & Simon , 1988 ) that LCT-techniques in general produce some
systematic errors in the determination of displacements. Their
significance depends also on several factors like the width of the
tracking window in relation to the size of the elements used as motion
tracers, and the presence of large intensity gradients in the images
(see section §4.3.4 for more details). Even so, this drawback does not
change the main conclusions of the present work since we are not
interested in fixing absolute values of velocities but rather in the
detection of large-scale regularly organized flows around the sunspots
in comparison with those typically found in a normal granulation field.
In both cases we use the solar granules as the tracers of motion and the
same size for the tracking window so that in case of some bias it will
affect to both velocity fields similarly.

##### 5.3.1 De-projection of horizontal velocities

The sample of sunspots studied in this paper includes a variety of
heliocentric positions on the solar disc as shown in Table 5.1 (with
@xmath , where @xmath is the heliocentric angle). Away from the solar
disc center, the measured proper motions are in fact projections of the
real horizontal velocities in the sunspot plane onto the plane
perpendicular to the LOS. Thus, to evaluate the real horizontal
velocities we have de-projected the velocities obtained from the LCT
technique to a plane tangent to the solar surface at the center of the
sunspot.

To that aim, let us consider in Figure 5.2 the orthogonal coordinate
system SX,SY,SZ (the Sunspot System, SS) with the SZ-axis perpendicular
to the plane tangent to the solar surface at the sunspot location and
the SX-axis tangent to the meridian of the solar sphere at this
location. Also included in the drawing is the coordinate system X,Y,Z
(the Observing System, OS) with a common origin, the Z-axis coinciding
with the LOS and the X-axis pointing to the axis crossing the Sun center
in a direction parallel to the LOS. Note that the axis, X, SX, Z, and SZ
are coplanar and SY and Y are collinear. The real horizontal velocities,
@xmath ( @xmath , are contained in the (SX, SY) plane whereas we observe
their projections @xmath ( @xmath , in the (X,Y) plane.

Calculations based on Figure 5.2 lead to the following relationships
(equations 5.1 and 5.2 ) between the magnitudes @xmath and @xmath , and
the azimuths @xmath and @xmath , that will allow us to de-project our
observations.

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Since the X- and Y- axes do not necessarily coincide with our natural
reference system (i.e. the edges of the CCD frame), the measurement of
the projected azimuths, @xmath , requires the knowledge of the
orientation of our FOV with respect to the X-axis that points to the
solar disc center.

##### 5.3.2 Masking moats

As mentioned above, for every sunspot series, the map of horizontal
velocities averaged over the whole time series is evaluated. In order to
coherently detect the moats and compare their statistics (section §
5.3.6 ) in all active regions of our sample, we have de-projected the
observed velocity vectors onto the sunspot plane (SX,SY) as described in
section § 5.3.1 .

Overlaying the observed images, we construct maps showing in the
granulation field only those projected velocity vectors having
de-projected magnitudes above a certain threshold. In these maps,
extensive organized outflows coming out from the sunspots can easily be
identified so that we can outline masks delimiting in a qualitative way
the area of the moats for the purpose of statistical calculations and
graphical representation.

We have fixed the mentioned threshold to @xmath 0.3 km s @xmath as the
best compromise to define the limits of the moats. This value should not
be understood as an absolute (universal) velocity threshold to define
moats in general. As we have mentioned before, the particular method
used here to measure the displacements may underestimate the velocity
magnitudes. Moreover, outside the moat one can easily find velocities
larger than that. The point is that this particular threshold makes in
our case more evident the existence of a well organized radial outflows
around the sunspots in comparison with the rest of the FOV. Lower values
(even zero) for the threshold do not extend the areas of organized flows
around the sunspots but produce maps with a very dense and noisy
(exploding granules everywhere) representation of arrows where the
outline of the frontiers of the moats results more difficult.

The whole masking process for one of the time series is illustrated
throughout the panels in Figure 5.3 and consist of:

-    a) Selecting the FOV we want to analyze. Hereafter we will use the
    spatial-scale in arc seconds.

-    b) Creating, by thresholding, a binary mask for the sunspots
    (including umbra and penumbrae) and pores.

-    c) Computing the proper motions of structures by applying LCT and
    plotting the flow map for the whole FOV in granulation regions.

-    d) De-projecting the velocities according to the equations 5.1 y
    5.2 . The de-projected magnitudes are represented in gray-scale.
    Bright/dark areas correspond to large/small velocity magnitudes. The
    velocity units are in km s @xmath .

-    e) Creating a binary mask for the de-projected velocity magnitudes
    according to the following rule: pixels with de-projected velocity
    magnitudes greater than 0.3 km s @xmath are set to ”1” and the rest
    to ”0”.

-    f) Applying the mask in e) to the flow map in panel c), so that we
    get only those projected velocities that have a de-proyected
    magnitude above the threshold of 0.3 km s @xmath . Over these new
    flow map we identified visually the flows coming out from the
    sunspot that correspond to the moat flows described before in this
    work. These moat flows are easily recognized surrounding the sunspot
    as large-scale outflows and hence they can be outlined without
    difficulty.

-    g) Creating a binary mask of moats from the mask generated in e),
    with the help of the moat boundaries outlined from the visual
    inspection in f).

-    h) Plotting the final flow map showing the moat flows. We apply the
    moat mask generated in g) onto the flow map of velocities in panel
    c).

##### 5.3.3 Moat flows around the sunspots

Our sunspots sample includes different penumbral configurations as a key
factor to establish the moat-penumbra relation in a more robust way.
Figures 5.4 to 5.8 show within the moats, only those velocity vectors
with de-projected magnitudes above 0.3 km s @xmath after applying the
whole masking procedure described above. In Figure 5.9 we extend this
representation to the entire granulation field showing that large
velocities are also present outside the moat. These velocities are
generally grouped and associated with exploding granules.

First we focus on granulation regions that display moat flows. Close
inspection of Figures 5.4 to 5.9 , and the upper panel of Figure 5.12
reveals that the velocity vectors in the moats are oriented following
the direction of the penumbral filaments. We observe that in all cases
the moat flow direction lines up with penumbral filaments that are
oriented radially with respect to the sunspot center. Nevertheless, the
completeness of the velocity vectors (density of arrows) in the flow
maps depends on the threshold previously imposed, as expected. This can
be seen in Figure 5.7 where the left-side penumbra does not seem to be
strictly associated with large flows in the granulation region. However,
this penumbral part has in fact an associated moat flow similar to the
other penumbral regions that is not visible in the representation since
the magnitude of the velocities is slightly lower than the threshold of
0.3 km s @xmath .

##### 5.3.4 Lacking moat flows

Next we consider granulation regions close to the sunspots that do not
display moat flows. All sunspots of our sample, except S3, have parts of
the umbral core sides that are free from penumbrae, having direct
contact with granulation regions. In all these granulation regions we do
not detect systematic large-scale outflows that fulfill our criteria for
moat flows. This supports the conclusion that umbral core boundaries
with no penumbra do not display moat flows.

Finally, there are also granulation regions in the vicinity of penumbrae
that lack significant moat flows. To study these cases in more detail we
mark peculiar regions of interest in Figures 5.4 , 5.6 , 5.7 and 5.8
with rectangular white boxes . These regions are represented as
close-ups in Figure 5.10 . In the first three panels (T), the penumbral
filaments display significant curvature such that they are not radially
oriented with respect to the sunspot center but extend in a direction
tangential to the sunspot border (as marked with black lines in the
overview images Figures 5.4 , 5.6 and 5.8 ). The lower right panel (R)
in Figure 5.10 shows a penumbra extending radially from the umbra. The
surrounding photosphere exhibits moat flows only in the direction of the
penumbral filaments (also see Figure 5.7 ). These four examples lead to
the conclusion that moat flows are not found in directions transverse to
the penumbral filaments.

In a few cases we found small pores in the vicinity of penumbrae in a
region where we would expect moat flows. Such cases are seen around
coordinates (19,29) in Figure 5.4 and coordinates (29,11) in Figure 5.8
. For these regions the measured proper motions are less reliable since
we have a FWHM=1 0 tracking window acting on a region of only a few arc
seconds ( @xmath 2-3) between the pore and penumbra. Another possibility
is that the pores themselves are somehow blocking the large outflows
changing the expected behavior. In the case presented in Figure 5.8 the
most plausible explanation for the absence of moats is the presence of a
neutral line close to coordinates (29,11) as we shall describe in
section § 5.3.5 .

The findings described above suggest a link between the moat flows and
the Evershed flows in penumbrae. We come back to this relation in
section § 5.4 .

The debate regarding the existence of a moat flow around umbral cores
and individual pores is still ongoing. In a work by Deng et al. ( 2007 )
, these authors found that the dividing line between radial inward and
outward proper motions in the inner and outer penumbra, respectively,
survived the decay phase, suggesting that the moat flow is still
detectable after the penumbra disappeared. These issues will be deeper
mentioned in the next chapter contrasting the results presented in this
thesis and some more examples in the literature.

##### 5.3.5 Neutral lines affecting the flows behavior

Only one of the sunspots we study displays a complete regular and
well-developed penumbra completely surrounding the umbral core. Figure
5.12 shows the flow map calculated for this active region, plotting the
horizontal velocities surrounding the sunspot with de-projected
magnitudes @xmath 0.3 km s @xmath . Large outflows are not found in a
part of the right side of the upper panel of Figure 5.12 ( rectangular
box) .

Following the findings of section § 5.3.3 , we would expect to find a
moat flow in this region. The penumbral filaments are oriented radially
from the umbral core which suggest the presence of a moat flow in the
granulation region in the direct vicinity. Even with a lower velocity
threshold, no moat flow can be discerned in this region. Nevertheless,
when comparing with a simultaneous magnetogram (see lower panel in
Figure 5.12 ), we found an inversion in magnetic polarity just outside
the right border of the sunspot: the magnetogram displays positive
polarity ( in white ) for the sunspot but negative polarity for the
small magnetic elements and pore just outside the penumbra. The reversal
of polarity (or neutral line) is confined to a narrow region that
roughly coincides with the sunspot border. The absence of large outflows
following this penumbra is suggestively related to the presence of this
neutral line that might somehow be acting as a blocking agent for the
moat flow in this region. The position of the neutral line measured by
LOS magnetograms is generally influenced by the location of the sunspot
( @xmath angle). In this case since the sunspot is very close to the
disc center we can claim for a reliable determination of the neutral
line.

For sunspot in Figure 5.8 there is also a neutral line crossing all
along the right-hand border of the sunspot from top to bottom around
coordinates (20,28) to (28,11), respectively, as reported by De Pontieu
et al. ( 2007 ) and shown here as Figure 5.11 . The penumbral filaments
extend from the umbra to the right and seems to bend, being forced to
follow the direction of the neutral line as approaching to it. The
sheared configuration of this penumbra is arranged so that the penumbral
filaments end up along directions parallel to the sunspot border. Moat
flows are then not found beyond this sort of penumbral configuration as
mentioned in section § 5.3.4 . The same behavior when having neutral
lines was presented in section §4.4.3 for a complex @xmath
-configuration active region. For that active region we found a strong
sheared neutral line crossing a penumbral border in a place where a moat
flow was expected to follow the penumbral filaments direction but
actually not detected. More observations of complex active regions with
neutral lines present in the vicinity of penumbrae are needed to firmly
establish the relation between the absence of moat flows and magnetic
neutral lines.

##### 5.3.6 Statistics of velocity fields in moats vs. quiet granulation

In this section the statistics of time-averaged horizontal velocity
fields in moats is performed. For the sake of comparison, the velocity
statistics in quiet granulation areas has also been computed. To that
aim, boxes ( @xmath 9 @xmath 9 arcsec @xmath ) in regions of
less-magnetized (quiet) granulation and far from the moat flows have
been manually selected in every FOV. Table 5.3 summarizes the
statistical properties of the de-projected magnitudes of horizontal
velocity fields within both moat masks and selected granular boxes. Here
we again remark that because of the possible underestimation of the
displacements by using LCT, we intend to perform not an absolute but a
comparative statistical study between moat regions, where we find
radially organized outflows, and quiet granulation regions far from the
sunspots.

For each sunspot of our sample three velocity magnitude maps result from
averaging over different time periods, namely: 5 min, 10 min and the
whole duration of the corresponding time series ¹ ¹ 1 Actually, when
averaging over 5 min (or 10 min) we obtain more than one map since we
then compute maps every 5 min (or 10 min) up to complete the total
duration of the series (i.e when having 40 min of duration for a time
series, we would finally obtain 8 maps of 5 min or 4 maps of 10 min).
This enable us to improve the statistics of the velocity magnitudes and
reduce the noise in our calculations. . Table 5.3 shows that in most
cases the mean velocity magnitude in moats is greater than in
granulation. In a few cases and only for averages in short time periods
(5, 10 min), we find similar values in both or even slightly lower
velocities in moats. However, when averaging over a long time period,
the difference of mean velocities in moats and granulation is in all
cases positive and more conspicuous than for short time period averages
(see column 10 in the Table). A similar behavior is obtained for the rms
parameter (see column 9 in the Table). The maximum velocity values are
also systematically larger in moats than in granulation.

The described statistical behavior is expected since for short time
averaging periods, of the order of the granulation lifetime (5-16 min,
see Hirzberger et al. ( 1999 ) and references there in), the proper
motions of the granulation structures compete in magnitude with the
velocity of large-scale flows. However, averaging velocity components
over long time periods results in local velocity cancellations in
short-lived structures while steady motions at large spatial scales
prevail. So moats can be considered as a long-term and large-scale
phenomenon where the mean velocity exceeds that of quiet granulation by
about 30%.

The significant fluctuations in @xmath (rms) and @xmath (mean) (columns
9 and 10 in Table 5.3 ) for the velocity fields averaged over the whole
time series, deserve a comment and possibly future improved
measurements. They could be ascribed to morphological differences in the
various cases considered or they could be related to the particular
evolutionary state or magnetic field strength in the various sunspots of
our sample. But we cannot forget that the de-projection formulas ( 5.1 )
and ( 5.2 ) include products, divisions and sums of products of
trigonometric functions. Accordingly, the accuracy in the measurement of
@xmath and @xmath is crucial for the determination of @xmath . Thus, two
sources of inaccuracy are: a) the assumption of constant heliocentric
angle @xmath all along the sunspot area (this has important impact in
regions far from the solar disc center), and b) the determination in our
FOV of the direction pointing to the solar disc center which defines the
X-axis of the Observing Coordinate System, i.e. the angular origin for
@xmath .

Figure 5.13 shows the histograms of de-projected velocity magnitudes for
averages over the whole time series for sunspots S1 to S7. Red lines
correspond to velocities inside the moats and the blue ones to
velocities in quiet granulation boxes. In all cases we find the same
general trend in both histograms. The red histograms are globally
shifted toward the right with respect to the blue ones.

The left wings of the histograms for granulation lie systematically
above those of the histograms for moats, and for S1, S2, S3, S4 and S6,
both histograms nearly coincide at the farthest left end. This means
that within the moats standard velocity values for quiet granulation are
still present although with a lower weight. Such is the case for the
fragments of exploding granules that additionally are swept by
large-scale moat flows.

At some point from left to right, both histograms cross each other so
that the right wing of the moat histogram surpasses the corresponding
quiet granulation wing and extends to larger velocity values ( @xmath
0.6 km s @xmath ). This confirms the predominance of large velocities in
moats. The intersection point of both histograms corresponds to @xmath
0.3 km s @xmath in almost all cases (a bit higher in S1, S2 and S4).
Interestingly, this value coincides with the threshold empirically
selected a priori (section § 5.3.2 ) to clearly distinguish the
frontiers of the moats, which confirms the goodness of the limit-value
(0.3 km s @xmath ) chosen to detect moats in our data set.

#### 5.4 Conclusions and discussion

Seven time series of sunspots were restored from instrumental and
atmospheric aberrations using MFBD and MOMFBD techniques. The great
quality of the images allowed us to study proper motions of granules
outside the sunspots and measure their time-averaged velocities which
describe the general trends of motions (not the same as the
instantaneous velocities).

The results from chapter §4 are extended in this chapter to a larger
sample of active regions and systematically confirmed the same findings:
a) moat flows are oriented following the direction of the penumbral
filaments; b) in granulation regions found adjacent to an irregular
penumbral side parallel to the penumbral filaments, moats are absent, or
in other words, moats do not develop in the direction transverse to the
penumbral filaments. Note that if the moat flows were originated by the
blockage of the heat flux from below by the penumbra, one would expect
moat flows directed along, but also, transverse to the direction of the
penumbral filaments; c) umbral core sides with no penumbra do not
display moat flows. Moreover we include in our sample a case in which a
neutral line extends along a penumbral border where we would expect a
moat flow continuation. For this sunspot we do not find any moat flow
following the direction of the penumbral filaments after crossing the
penumbral border where we see a change in magnetic polarity. The same
result was found in section §4.4.3 in a penumbral portion of a complex
active region crossed by a strong sheared neutral line.

All these results indicate a likely connection between the moat flows
and flows aligned with penumbral filaments. In a recent work, Cabrera
Solana et al. ( 2006 ) suggest that the Evershed clouds inside penumbrae
propagate to the surrounding moat and then become MMFs after crossing
the sunspot border. The MMFs displacements trace very well-defined paths
that can actually be clearly seen when averaging magnetograms in time.
Some of these MMFs are seen to start inside the penumbra ( Sainz Dalda &
Martínez Pillet , 2005 ) . We refer the reader to section §3.5.2 for
more information about these new studies.

In this chapter we also complement the results of section §4.5 with a
statistical analysis describing in a quantitative way the differences
between velocity fields in moat flows and in less-magnetized solar
granulation in the nearby. In contrast to the case of granulation, moat
flows are well-organized, steady and large-scale motions. For averages
made over more than 40 minutes, the mean velocity in moats (0.3 km s
@xmath ) exceeds that of quiet granulation ( @xmath 0.23 km s @xmath )
by about 30%, although we obtain a considerable dispersion in the
results. Also the rms of the velocity magnitude is greater in moats by a
similar percentage.

The histograms of velocity magnitudes in the moats are broader than
those in granulation (see Figure 5.13 ). The histograms of granulation
show conspicuous maxima, most of them in a range from 0.2 to 0.3 km s
@xmath , whereas the histograms of moats present a flatter top.
Systematically, the left wing of the granulation histogram lies above
that corresponding to the moat. At some point about 0.3 - 0.4 km s
@xmath , both histograms cross each other and the right wing of the moat
histogram extends beyond that of the granulation to larger velocity
values ( @xmath 0.6 km s @xmath ).

We have studied one case of a sunspot penumbra displaying a neutral line
all along a sector of the penumbra (Figure 5.12 ). This neutral line is
detected at the penumbral boundary but also emphasized by a large
opposite polarity concentration nearby. Interestingly, this penumbral
sector shows no moat flow. We interpret this evidence as an indication
of the Evershed flow being forced to go into deeper sub-photospheric
layers at a faster pace than what is normally though to occur in
penumbral regions not associated to neutral lines ( Westendorp Plaza et
al. , 1997 ) . A similar case, but in a sheared neutral line of a @xmath
-spot, was found in section §4.4.3.

The important questions related to the flows inside and outside sunspots
are yet being studied. In the present work we contribute with a new
sample of sunspots observed between 2003 and 2006 in six different
observing campaigns. The data sets have been selected on basis of the
seeing quality (sharpness, homogeneity, duration) and the availability
of suitable targets: the presence of spots with some form of irregular
penumbra. In all of our samples we follow the evolution of the sunspots
for more than 40 min. Although this only represents a snapshot in the
evolution of the sunspots through all their emerging and decaying
processes, our sample includes sunspots in different evolutionary stages
and penumbral configurations.

### Chapter 6 Flow field around solar pores \dropping

[0pt]2This chapter is devoted to the study of flows around solar pores.
After the last two chapters, meant to analyze horizontal flows
surrounding different types of sunspots in detail, this one deals
specifically with pores. We are interested in observing and analyzing
pores because, different from sunspots, they do not have penumbra at
all, so that our main conclusions about the relation between moats and
penumbrae can be tested in these scenarios as explained in the following
sections.

#### 6.1 Introduction

Though there is increasing evidence linking the moat flows and the
Evershed flow along the penumbral filaments, the debate regarding the
existence of a moat flow around umbral cores and individual pores is
still undergoing. In a recent work, Deng et al. ( 2007 ) , found that
the dividing line between radial inward and outward proper motions in
the inner and outer penumbra, respectively, survived the decay phase,
suggesting that the moat flow is still detectable after the penumbra
disappeared. Figure 6.1 shows the active region studied by these
authors. The sunspot evolution is shown over six days during its
decaying phase. Yellow corks trace the dividing line between inward and
outwards proper motions in the penumbra.

Previous works ( Sobotka et al. , 1999 ; Roudier, Bonet & Sobotka , 2002
; Hirzberger , 2003 ) have measured horizontal proper motions in and
around pores and have observed some penetrating flows at the umbral
boundaries and a ringlike structure of positive divergence (”rosettas”)
around the pores which is related to a continuous activity of exploding
granules in the granulation around them. Roudier, Bonet & Sobotka ( 2002
) identified a very clear inflow around pores which corresponds to the
penetration of small granules and granular fragments from the
photosphere into the pores, pushed by granular motions originated in the
divergence centres around them. They conclude that the motions at the
periphery of the pore are substantially and continuously influenced by
the external plasma flows deposited by the exploding granules. Figure
6.2 shows the pore studied by Roudier, Bonet & Sobotka ( 2002 ) and the
horizontal velocity field averaged over 5 minutes where the centers of
divergence are clearly identified forming the ringlike structure around
the pore with mean velocities @xmath 0.3 km s @xmath .

Pores are interesting to analyze since, as they do not display penumbrae
( Keil , 1999 ) , what we actually observe is the direct interaction
between the umbra (with a strong vertical magnetic field that inhibits
convection inside it) and the convective plasma in the surrounding
photosphere, without any intermediate structure in between. Many
observed features such as bright granules moving in the border of a pore
( Sobotka et al. , 1999 ) show the complex exchange taking place between
the pore and the granulation surrounding it.

In this chapter we aim to get velocity flow fields from high-resolution
time series showing the evolution of solar regions having pores. Thus,
we shall be able to analyze the horizontal flows around the solar pores
under study to figure out from the flow maps how the plasma behaves. The
data analyzed are sets taken at both ground-based and space telescopes.
The observations were obtained with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope and
the space telescope HINODE in 2007. In the next two sections the
observations and the processing applied to the images are described in
some detail.

#### 6.2 Observations and data processing: SST Data

##### 6.2.1 Observations

The campaign at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope was carried out during
September-October 2007 and corresponds to an important collaboration
among several European and Japanese institutions. This was a long
campaign (24 days) with joint observations using not only the SST but
also three other solar telescopes (DOT,VTT and THEMIS) at the Canary
Islands Observatories in La Palma and Tenerife, respectively. Moreover,
and for the very first time, coordinated observations with the space
solar telescope HINODE ( Kosugi et al. , 2007 ) were performed as part
of the Hinode Operation Program 14.

The data from the SST analyzed in this chapter were recorded during a
particular observing run on 30 September 2007 and correspond to the
active region NOAA 10971. The characteristics of the telescope and some
important details concerning the observations are sketched and listed in
Figure 4.1 and Table 4.1 respectively. The main target was a region
close to the solar disc center ( @xmath =0.98) with some pores of
different sizes embedded in a plage region that exhibits an intense
magnetic activity.

The optical setup consisted in two channels: ( blue and red ). The blue
channel was devoted to imaging and the red one to feed the SOUP filter.
In the blue channel, images in G-band and CaII H were acquired at a high
cadence so that the MFBD restoration technique (see section §1.5) could
be applied to correct for atmospheric and instrumental aberrations.
Table 6.1 enumerates the main parameters of the images in the blue
channel.

Along the red beam the SOUP filter was placed, as mentioned before.
Section §4.2.1 details the description of the instrument and its
operation. A beam splitter positioned in front of the SOUP deflected a
fraction of light to obtain simultaneous broad-band PD image-pairs in
the continuum near the selected wavelength (FeI 6302 Å). These images
made up an additional object for the MOMFBD algorithm to jointly restore
both, the broad-band and the narrow-band images (see section §1.5). From
the restored narrow-band images we computed magnetograms and
dopplergrams.

Once the observing run was over, only the best quality images (above a
certain threshold) in both channels (blue and red) were preserved for
further processing and the rest were discarded.

##### 6.2.2 Data processing

Post-processing of the images included first the standard flatfielding
and dark current subtraction, as well as the elimination of hot and dark
pixels and spurious borders in the flatfielded images. After these
steps, the images were ready to be restored so that we could group them
in sets of restoration.

###### Blue beam

In the blue channel, G-band and CaII H images were independently
restored by employing MFBD. For each wavelength, the image sequence was
grouped in sets of about 80 frames acquired within time intervals of 10
seconds each. Every set yielded one restored image. So, from @xmath
52640 single exposures in G-band and as many in CaII H (more than 10
@xmath images adding G-band and CaII H) we obtained a total of 658
restored images per wavelength.

Next steps in the data post-processing were: compensation for diurnal
field rotation, rigid alignment of the images, correction for distortion
and finally subsonic filtering. For more details see section §4.3.3
where similar procedures are described for the SST data of the 2005
campaign.

Due to periods of bad seeing in which the quality did not reach the
desired top level, some of the images were discarded and we kept only
the best and longest consecutive sequence of images. The very final
product were 4 time series (2 for G-band, 2 for CaII H) with the
characteristics listed in Table 6.2 . The time gap of about 5 min
between the two consecutive series for each wavelength was a consequence
of a telescope tracking interruption. That is also why the FOV is
slightly different in both time series. Most images forming the time
series show details near the diffraction limit of the telescope. Figure
6.3 displays one of the G-band restored images (in false color) with
close-ups enhancing very tiny bright features in the intergranular
lanes.

###### Red beam

In the red beam images were restored with MOMFBD. The procedure followed
for image restoration and for obtaining magnetograms and dopplergrams is
the same as that applied to the observing material of the 2005 campaign
(see section §4.3.5). Figure 6.4 shows one of the co-temporal sets of
images of the emerging active region after restorations.

#### 6.3 Observations and data processing: HINODE Data

After launched on the 22 @xmath September 2006 HINODE has become a very
useful tool in the solar physics research. It has played an important
role since it started pointing to the Sun and managed to observe many
solar features in such a high detail by avoiding the distortion effects
produced by the Earth’s atmosphere. The public archive of HINODE ¹ ¹ 1
See the website: http://solar-b.nao.ac.jp/hsc_e/darts_e.shtml is an
organized data base where all HINODE observations can be searched and
downloaded in such an easy way.

We were interested in HINODE observations of solar pores taken with the
Solar Optical Telescope (SOT), in order to pursue our study of
photospheric flows as explained in section § 6.1 . Next two sections
describe the HINODE data we analyze in the present work. These data
extend the sample of cases under study in the present work and moreover
give us the possibility to compare with the results stemming from
ground-based observations.

##### 6.3.1 Data on 1 June 2007

Solar portion including an isolated and round-shaped pore observed by
HINODE on 1 June 2007. Images were acquired in G-band with a cadence of
30 seconds covering a FOV of 27 85 @xmath 55 70 close to the disk center
( @xmath =0.87). After subsonic filtering we obtained two time series:
one from 21:35 to 21:55 UT with 40 images and a second one from 22:26 to
23:33 UT with 134 images. Table 6.3 (1 Jun) summarizes the parameters of
the time series in more detail.

The treatment performed with HINODE data does not include any
restoration process because of their excellent quality as a consequence
of the absence of atmospheric turbulence.

##### 6.3.2 Data on 30 September 2007

The data from HINODE on 30 September 2007 corresponds to the coordinated
observations described in section § 6.2.1 . HINODE observed in G-band
the emerging flux region during almost the whole day from 00:14 to 17:59
UT with a few brief interruptions for calibrations. Table 6.3 (30 Sep)
summarizes the parameters of the time series in more detail. Figure 6.5
( left ) sketches the correspondence between the FOV observed by HINODE
(51 1 @xmath 102 2) and the one framed by the SST (69 6 @xmath 69 6). A
large region of the SST FOV is covered by HINODE observations as shown
in the figure.

HINODE data presents quite a few misalignments due to tiny tracking
flaws and also to every temporal interruption. Hence, we decided to
align all the 1030 images (18 hours) at a sub-pixel level. Taking the
first image as the reference, next consecutive images were aligned to it
by using a routine that made a first alignment approach (in case of
large misalignments). In a second iteration, the alignment with the
first image was refined by correlating pairs of subsequent images and
accumulating their misalignments. Once all images were perfectly
aligned, the FOV was clipped to get rid of spurious borders resulting
from the alignment process.

Next step on the processing is the subsonic filtering of the series.
This task resulted a bit tedious not only because of the short temporal
interruptions (a total of 7 during the 18 hours) in the series but also
because of the big size of the images and the large amount of them. To
overcome this drawback we fragmented the total 18 hours series in 8 data
cubes of about 130 images each so that consecutive images in every cube
were equally spaced. Subsonic filtering was applied independently to
every cube. The final FOV (57 1 @xmath 102 2) is shown in Figure 6.5 (
right panel ) for the first image at 00:14:55 UT.

#### 6.4 Data analysis and results

##### 6.4.1 General description of horizontal proper motions in the FOV

The G-band series taken from SST and HINODE have been used to analyze
the horizontal proper motions of structures in every FOV. Proper motions
were measured by using the same LCT-technique employed in previous
chapters. In this section we show the maps of horizontal velocities
calculated for the different time series using a Gaussian tracking
window of FWHM @xmath which is roughly half of the typical granular
size.

Figure 6.6 shows the flow maps computed from the two restored time
series in the SST. The velocities were averaged over the total duration
of each series. The underlying background in the maps is the average
image of the respective series. As commented above, the FOV is slightly
different in both cases so that, for instance, pore at coordinates
(17,26) in the upper map of the figure is located at (24,42) in the
lower map.

The maps are dominated by flows coming from exploding granules taking
place all over the FOV. The map averaging over a longer time period (48
min) is slightly smoother than the other one (20 min), and displays
rather lower velocities. Nevertheless, both maps (48 and 20 min average)
reproduce in general the same proper motions all over the FOV. The top
of the FOV in Figure 6.6 ( upper panel ) shows large flows caused by
exploding granular events. These events are grouped at every upper
corner of the FOV forming two structures that fit well the supergranular
scale (see also the magnetogram in Figure 6.4 ). A smaller portion of
these structures can also be identified in the lower panel of Figure 6.6
. Even though a complete description of the proper motions around the
pores in the FOV will be done in section § 6.4.5 , a glance at the
figure reveals no evidence of a moat-like pattern around any of the
pores. The central part of the FOV where the smaller pores are embedded,
exhibits a lower magnitude of horizontal velocities. This behavior is
explained by the intense magnetic activity in this part of the FOV as
unveiled by the correspondent magnetogram of the zone shown in Figure
6.4 .

Concerning HINODE data, the computed map of horizontal velocities for
the time series on 1 June 2007 is displayed in Figure 6.7 . The flow map
shown in this figure is calculated for the longest time series (67
minutes, see Table 6.3 ). The isolated solar pore is immerse in a
granular region displaying several and recurrent large exploding
granular events all around it. The connection of the centers of the
exploding events outlines a round-shaped contour at a distance from the
pore border similar to the pore radius. The periphery of the pore is
hereby influenced by plasma flows being deposited by exploding granular
events. Velocity magnitudes in the outer part of the outlined contour
are clearly larger than those in the inner part between the contour and
the pore border.

##### 6.4.2 Averaging horizontal flows in different time intervals

Here we study the influence of different time averages of velocity maps
in a time series of solar pores. To that aim we consider averaging
intervals of 5, 10, 15 and 20 min in the best quality G-band time series
recorded at the SST (the second series in Table 6.2 ). Figures 6.8 and
6.9 show the resulting mean velocity map for each case. As expected, the
maps are smoother for longer averaging periods. Note that regardless we
average over 5 or 20 min intervals, we find essentially the same general
trends and exploding granular patterns all over the FOV, meaning that
the averaging periods we are employing are smaller than or about the
lifetime of the observed structures, and that even from a short time
sequence we get a reliable picture of the plasma dynamics in the FOV. It
is also worth mentioning that we do not recognize any moat-like flow
around the pores for such different time averages.

The statistics of the velocity magnitudes for every time average has
been computed and the resulting histograms are shown in Figure 6.10 .
Although the distribution of velocity magnitudes is very similar in the
four cases considered, one can easily detect that the histograms shift
to the left as long as the averaging periods increase. Thus, the largest
velocity magnitudes range from 1.83 to 1.97 km s @xmath and the mean
values from 0.48 to 0.50 km s @xmath . In both cases, smaller/larger
values correspond to longer/shorter time averages.

##### 6.4.3 Long-term evolution of the velocity field

In order to investigate how the evolution of the emerging region affects
the velocity in the FOV for long periods of time, we have used the
HINODE time series lasting for several hours. HINODE data on 30
September 2007 corresponds to 18 hours of almost continuous solar
observation as reported in section § 6.3.2 . The stability and long
duration of the series is ideal for the analysis of proper motions in
the emerging flux region. In particular we are interested in the
evolution of the maps of horizontal velocities averaged over every hour.
We have computed 14 of this maps starting from the first hour of
observation 00:14 UT up to the time 14:00 UT; during this long period of
time we have the region of interest in our FOV. Afterwards, because of
failures in the telescope tracking and a stop for calibration purposes,
the FOV changes significantly and the main pore within the region moves
further away to the border of the FOV.

Images are grouped then in sets of one hour and every set is processed
independently resulting in a map of horizontal velocities averaged over
the total duration of the set. The majority of the sets have a duration
of 60 minutes except for four of them with 46,45,45 and 55 min
respectively. These four sets will be understood hereafter as one-hour
sets for description purposes although the average to calculate the map
of velocities is performed over the actual duration of every set,
respectively. The 14 maps of horizontal velocities are computed using a
Gaussian tracking window of FWHM 1 0. Figures 6.11 - 6.14 show all the
flow maps with the indication of the time period they correspond to, and
the background image represents the averaged image of every 1-hour set.

The main pore is located in the spatial position (37,55) in the first
map (Figures 6.11 ) and surrounded by some smaller pores which form
altogether a sort of vertical and elongated structure in the figure. The
collection of these pores is evolving in time and some of them start
merging and disappearing. The final picture of the region displayed in
Figure 6.14 shows the isolated main pore with only a very tiny
companion.

We do not identify any signal of moat-like flow around the pores in any
of the evolutionary stages shown in the maps sequence but continuous
activity caused by exploding granules. Centers of divergence are
systematically identified, some of them very close to the pore border.
Proper motions displaying inward components are more common around the
pores and any outward regular and large-scale flow, as corresponding to
a moat-flow, is found. These results are firmly validated because of the
long duration of the sample and reinforce the previous analysis pursued
for the only 1-hour SST data.

##### 6.4.4 Distribution of horizontal speeds in the FOV

The global speed distribution in a granulation field can be easily
visualized by means of false-color maps showing the areas including
velocity magnitudes within certain ranges. Figures 6.15 and 6.16 show
the location ( white areas ) of velocity magnitudes in three different
ranges in km s @xmath , for the SST data (the first series in Table 6.2
):

-    Low velocity magnitudes: @xmath 0.3.

-    Medium velocity magnitudes: 0.3 - 0.8.

-    Large velocity magnitudes: @xmath 0.8.

Small speeds are mainly grouped in the central part of the FOV where an
intense magnetic activity is detected as evidenced by the high
concentration of G-band bright points and faculae present in this region
(see Figures 6.3 and 6.4 ). Around pores, the velocity magnitudes mainly
correspond to the lower range ( @xmath 0.3 km s @xmath ) so that they
are surrounded by white areas in Figure 6.15 ( upper panel ).

The areas mapping medium velocity magnitudes are regularly spread out
all over the FOV except in the proximity of pores (Figure 6.15 lower
panel ). The shape of empty ( non white ) areas around the pores almost
reproduce the pores shape.

Large velocities ( @xmath 0.8 km s @xmath ) are not homogeneously
distributed in the FOV but mainly located in the two upper corners of
Figure 6.16 ( upper panel ) where the granulation is less-magnetized
(see magnetogram in Figure 6.4 ). These zones show large velocity flows
that might reflect the presence of supergranular cells as commented in
section § 6.4.1 .

Figure 6.16 ( lower panel ) shows the mask of areas ( in white )
corresponding to very low horizontal velocities ( @xmath 0.2 km s @xmath
) plotted over co-spatial and temporal H @xmath ( false color ) image.
The correspondence between the bright structures in H @xmath and the
regions of close-to-zero horizontal velocities is clearly seen. In the
filamentary stripe-like structures in H @xmath connecting the two
polarities (see magnetogram in Figure 6.4 ), there is a high density of
low velocities ( white areas ) whereas this density shrinks when going
to the upper part of the FOV in Figure 6.16 ( lower panel ).

##### 6.4.5 Velocity distribution around solar pores

From the computed velocity fields we can do detailed analysis of the
velocity distribution around the solar pores. To pursue this study we
will use the region observed with the SST were we have a collection of
pores to work with. As we have two time series for this region (see
Table 6.2 ), we will employ the first one covering a longest time
period, except for one of the pores which is out of the FOV. For this
pore we will use the second time series. Figure 6.17 shows the FOV
including all the pores under study which are labeled for easy
identification hereafter.

Figure 6.18 illustrates the projection of the velocities into radial and
transversal components as a convenient way to compute inward and outward
motions. The figure plots two points in the granulation surrounding a
solar pore ( red dots ) with their corresponding velocity vectors @xmath
. The pore is centered at coordinates @xmath with respect to the
orthogonal coordinate system X,Y placed in the lower left corner of the
FOV. Vector @xmath is the position vector of a given point with respect
to the pore center. The pore center is located at its gravity-center
calculated by weighting the position of every point inside the pore with
the inverse of its respective intensity. Velocity vectors in every point
of the granulation surrounding the pore are projected into radial @xmath
and transversal @xmath components.

By using the pore named as TENERIFE in Figure 6.17 we will illustrate
the procedure followed to calculate velocity directions, throughout the
panels in Figure 6.19 . In the following itemization, we will describe
the steps corresponding to each panel in the figure:

-    a) Selection of the FOV that includes the pore under study.

-    b) Selection of a correlation box. Since active regions in general,
    and pores in particular, exhibit their own displacement (due to
    differential rotation and intrinsic motions) while embedded in the
    granulation pattern, we align the time series respect to an area
    framing the pore (correlation box) so that we make sure we are
    measuring plasma motions with respect to the pore.

-    c) Horizontal shifts for alignment correction as computed by
    cross-correlation.

-    d) Vertical shifts for alignment correction as computed by
    cross-correlation.

-    e) Map of horizontal velocities as computed from LCT.

-    f) Calculation of radial directions for short distances. The
    ”radial directions” that we use as the reference to project the
    velocities are defined as perpendicular to the pore border. These
    perpendicular directions are calculated from the gradients of
    intensity in a smoothed pore-mask image. This way, we can also
    manage with non round-shaped pores. The limit for short distances is
    defined by thresholding the intensity gradients. The threshold
    depends on the pore shape and size.

-    g) Calculation of radial directions for long distances. At large
    distances we consider all pores as round-shaped structures (as in
    Figure 6.18) and the radial directions are defined by the position
    vector @xmath of a given point with respect to the pore center.

-    h) Determination of inward and outward motions. According to
    Figure 6.18, inward/outward motions correspond to @xmath
    negative/positive, where @xmath is the angle formed by @xmath and
    the positive radial direction (outward) at each point of the FOV.
    The value of @xmath is mapped in gray scale in panel h), ranging
    from 1 for purely radial outward velocities ( in black ) to -1 for
    purely inward velocities ( in white ).

-    i) Creation of a binary mask. A binary mask is created from the
    gray-scaled map in h). Areas in black and white correspond to
    velocities with positive (outward) and negative (inward) radial
    components, respectively.

-    j) Selection of a final clipped FOV.

Once the method to describe the velocity directions has been set, we
apply it to our sample of 7 different pores shown in Figure 6.17 . The
results are displayed in Figures 6.20 to 6.26 where we have: the
averaged FOV around the pore, the velocity field, the gray-scale
representation of @xmath , and the final mask of velocities with inward
( white ) and outward ( black ) radial components. The analysis of all
cases establish that the flows display a clear preference for inward
directions around the pores. This fact is systematically found in all
examples. The more regular-shaped pores (Figures 6.20 and 6.21 ) are
surrounded by an also regular annular-like area with inward velocity
components, having a mean width similar to the center-to-border distance
in the pore. The dividing line between inward and outward motions is
connecting the centers of divergence.

Figures 6.27 and 6.28 show for the two regular-shaped pores, an average
image (48 min) of the time series ( upper panels ) and a color-scaled
image representing the horizontal velocity magnitudes ( middle panels ).
Both pores exhibit a sort of proto-penumbral structure though not very
emphasized. Signals of proto-penumbra appearance are also visible in
other pores of our sample (e.g. see Figure 6.22 ).

The FOV in Figures 6.27 and 6.28 is dominated by flows with velocity
magnitudes up to 1 km s @xmath . The centers of divergence are also
visible and clearly identified in these images as black structures
around the pores. Another important distinctive feature that comes out
from these images is that the highest magnitudes of horizontal
velocities are placed beyond these black structures away from the pore.

In order to study how speeds of proper motions around the pore are
changing, we calculate the mean velocity magnitude in a sort of ribbons
(stripes) around the pore. A total of 12 adjacent ribbons ( @xmath 0 24
wide), referred to as ring-like structures surrounding the pore, are
used for this analysis. Figures 6.27 and 6.28 ( lower panels ) plot the
relation between speeds of proper motions versus distance to the pore
border. The velocity magnitudes increment as a function of this
distance: 1) the mean value of speeds increments rapidly at distances
ranging from @xmath 0 15 to 0 4; 2) in the range 0 4 - 1 0 the variation
curve is flatter; 3) in the range 1 0 - 1 6 we again obtain very sharp
increments. Up to this distance from the pore border, we observe the
same behavior in both pores. Nevertheless, the mean speed values at 1 6
are quite different (250 vs. 390 m s @xmath ). At further distances (
@xmath 1 6) the trend in the mean velocity magnitudes differs
substantially. We must have in mind that the flows around the pore can
also be affected by the intrinsic characteristics of every single pore
and by the contribution from other sources in the neighbourhood,
e.g. pores in the vicinity.

#### 6.5 Conclusions and discussion

We obtained time series for solar regions displaying pores from both
ground-based and space observations. We then analyzed the horizontal
displacements of the plasma around solar pores by means of LCT. This is
the first time we have tested with HINODE data, our standard reduction
routines for LCT and p-modes filtering. The long duration, stability and
high-resolution of the data achieved by HINODE enable us to get
extremely useful time series to study dynamical properties of the
horizontal flows in the photosphere in periods much longer than those we
are used to have in ground-based observations which are restricted by
the changing seeing conditions.

The LCT technique applied to the series allowed us to track the proper
motions of structures in the regions nearby solar pores. We conclude
that the flows calculated from different solar observations are coherent
among each other and show the determinant and overall influence of
exploding events in the granulation around the pores and in the whole
FOV for every single set. Motions towards the pores in their nearest
vicinity are the dominant characteristic we claim to observe
systematically.

The motions at the periphery of the pores are basically influenced by
the external plasma flows deposited by the exploding events, as
suggested by other authors in previous works ( Sobotka et al. , 1999 ;
Roudier, Bonet & Sobotka , 2002 ) .

We interpret the dividing line between radial inward and outward
motions, found by Deng et al. ( 2007 ) outside the residual pore (see
panel f in Figure 6.1 ), as corresponding to the location of the centres
of divergence of the exploding events around the pore. The outward
motions these authors describe, which are not in the immediate
surroundings of the pore but separated by the annular inward motion,
would then correspond not to moat flows but to the outward flows
originated in the regular mesh of divergence centers around the pore.

### Chapter 7 Conclusions \dropping

[0pt]2The first part of this work deals with the problem of image
degradation caused by atmospheric and instrumental aberrations. By using
image restoration techniques we can correct the images and bring them
near the diffraction limit of the telescope. One of the aims at working
with these novel techniques is the correction of the instrumental
aberrations that will be present in the SUNRISE mission, in particular
in the images produced by the IMaX instrument, a magnetograph designed
and built by a Spanish consortium leaded by the Instituto de Astrofísica
de Canarias.

Nowadays, the use of numerical restoration techniques is determinant and
compulsory to obtain high-resolution images, and stands as a key tool
for recent and future solar physics advances and developments. In that
sense, the present work represents an effort to have high-quality
observations in IMaX by defining the method to calibrate the in-flight
instrumental aberrations. The method is based on the Phase Diversity
(PD) inversion algorithm.

The robustness of the method has been tested by numerical experiments
simulating different aberration components applied to synthetic solar
images. Degradation followed by PD-inversion has allowed to compare the
goodness of the match between the input values for degradation and those
resulting from the inversion. The sources of aberration have been
modelled and added in subsequent experiments. The repercussion of every
new added ingredient in the final result from the inversion has been
evaluated. The PD-code does not accurately reproduce the shape of the
wavefront errors but provides suitable OTFs for subsequent satisfactory
restorations. The results of the inversions can be considered reliable
enough as to validate the method proposed for the calibration of errors
in the images of IMaX, at least for aberrations lying in the range:
rms-ripple @xmath 2/60 and rms-LOA @xmath 1/4 waves.

The second part of the work is devoted to the observation and analysis
of solar active regions. In particular we have studied the dynamical
behaviour of the plasma around sunspots and solar pores at a
photospheric level. We analyzed data from ground-based (SST) and space
(HINODE) telescopes. Ground-based data are firstly corrected for
atmospheric and instrumental aberrations with the methods described in
the first part of the work, generating in this way time series of images
displaying the solar evolution in active regions.

Local correlation tracking techniques have been employed to infer proper
motion of structures within the FOV. We are mainly interested in the
photospheric horizontal flows around sunspots and pores. A sample
including various sunspots with different penumbral configurations, and
solar pores was analyzed.

The main findings concerning the existence of moats surrounding sunspots
depending on the penumbral configurations exhibit by them are:

-    Moat flows are oriented following the direction of the penumbral
    filaments.

-    In granulation regions found adjacent to penumbral sides parallel
    to the penumbral filaments, moats are absent, or in other words,
    moats do not develop in the direction transverse to the penumbral
    filaments.

-    Umbral core sides with no penumbra do not display moat flows.

-    Around solar pores there are not signs of moat flows. In all the
    cases studied we have found evidence of exploding granules activity
    in the pore’s surroundings.

Moreover we include in our study two examples in which a neutral line
extends along a penumbral border where we would expect a moat flow
continuation. For these cases we do not find any moat flow following the
direction of the penumbral filaments after crossing the penumbral border
where we see a change in magnetic polarity. The presence of neutral
lines appears to be significantly affecting the behaviour of the plasma
flows, preventing the appearance of moats.

#### 7.1 Future prospects

More upcoming data from the HINODE telescope as well as from new
facilities and missions like SUNRISE will provide long-time series of
active regions with a constant image quality and enough
spatial-resolution to establish firm confirmation of the evidences and
findings presented in this thesis. The addition of simultaneous Doppler
and magnetogram data to the continuum intensity (or G-band) data sets
will enhance our understanding of the link between the Evershed flow
inside penumbrae and the moat flows around sunspots. Needless to say,
the study of those stages were penumbrae are just formed or destroyed
becomes of extreme importance to validate our findings. Similarly, the
results that can be expected in the coming years from local
helioseismology, in particular those related to the f-mode ( Gizon et
al. , 2000 ) , describing the flow patterns in the deeper layers near
sunspots will be crucial for the establishment of a clear link between
these two well-known flow patterns, Evershed and moat, that has not been
appreciated yet.

The interpretation of these results in terms of convective cells
surrounding sunspots (e.g., Bovelet & Wiehr , 2003 ) may be different if
the Evershed flow turns out to be the major process that injects mass
into the moats surrounding sunspots.

More observations of complex active regions with neutral lines present
in the vicinity of penumbrae are needed to firmly establish the relation
between the absence of moat flows and magnetic neutral lines.

We believe that one of the more relevant results put forward in this
work suggesting that the moat flow is the continuation outside the spots
of the Evershed flow, deserves adequate attention in the future from
both an observational and a theoretical point of view.

### Conclusiones \dropping

[0pt]2En la primera parte de este trabajo de tesis se aborda el problema
de degradación de imagen causada por aberraciones atmosféricas e
instrumentales. Gracias a las nuevas técnicas de reconstrucción de
imágenes podemos corregir estos efectos perturbadores y alcanzar un alto
grado de resolución cercano al límite de resolución del telescopio.

Uno de los principales objetivos que se presiguen en esta tesis al
trabajar con estas innovadoras técnicas es el de aplicarlas en la
corrección de las aberraciones instrumentales en IMaX. Este instrumento
es un magnetógrafo solar que forma parte de la misión SUNRISE (un
telescopio solar de un metro de apertura que volará en un globo
aerostático y recogerá imágenes solares continuamente durante 15 dias).
IMaX está desarrollado enteramente por un consorcio de instituciones
españolas, siendo el Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias la institución
que lidera el proyecto.

Actualmente las técnicas de restauración de imágenes se han convertido
en herramientas indispensables para el avance en el estudio de la Física
Solar. En este sentido, el presente trabajo representa un esfuerzo para
tener observaciones de alta calidad en IMaX definiendo el método para
calibrar las aberraciones instrumentales en vuelo. Este método se basa
en el algoritmo de inversión de Diversidad de Fase (DF).

Se ha validado la robustez del método de calibración de aberraciones
mediante experimentos numéricos, simulando diferentes componentes de
aberración sobre imagenes solares sintéticas. La degradación de las
imágenes seguida de su inversión con DF, ha sido el proceso utilizado
para comparar la bondad del ajuste entre los valores de entrada al
degradar y los obtenidos despues de la inversión. Las diversas fuentes
de aberración se han modelado y añadido en sucesivos experimentos. Hemos
evaluado la repercusión que tiene cada ingrediente añadido, sobre el
resultado final de la inversión. El código de DF no reproduce en detalle
la forma de los errores del frente de onda sino que proporciona OTFs
adecuadas para producir restauraciones satisfactorias. Los resultados de
las inversiones pueden considerarse lo suficientemente fiables como para
validar el método propuesto para la calibración de errores en las
imágenes de IMaX, al menos para aberraciones dentro del rango:
rms-ripple @xmath 2/60 and rms-LOA @xmath 1/4 waves.

La segunda parte de la tesis esta dirigida al estudio y análisis de
regiones solares activas. En particular se ha estudiado el
comportamiento y dinámica del plasma a nivel fotosférico alrededor de
manchas y poros solares. Para ello se han utilizado observaciones hechas
en Tierra (SST) y del telescopio espacial (HINODE) recientemente lanzado
al espacio. A través de series temporales se han estudiado los
movimientos propios de estructuras en la zona granular que circunda
manchas y poros, considerando una amplia muestra de ambos.

Los principales hallazgos que surgen de este trabajo de tesis son:

-    Los flujos de gran escala aldededor de las manchas solares
    (llamados flujos de foso) se orientan siguiendo la dirección de los
    filamentos penumbrales.

-    En las regiones de granulación adjacentes a penumbras en donde los
    filamentos son paralelos al borde penumbral, no se encuentran signos
    de flujos de foso .

-    Las regiones de granulación adjacentes a nucleos umbrales (es decir
    sin penumbra), no muestran indicios de presencia de flujos de foso .
    Es decir, los flujos de foso no se producen en dirección transversal
    a los filamentos penumbrales.

-    Alrededor de los poros analizados no se encuentran signos de flujos
    de foso . En todos los casos se han encontrado evidencias de flujos
    provenientes de gránulos explosivos alrededor de estos poros.

Sumado a esto, se han analizado también un par de ejemplos en donde hay
presencia de líneas neutras que se extienden longitudinalmente a lo
largo de bordes penumbrales en donde se esperaría observar flujos de
foso. Para estos casos sin embargo no se ha detectado este tipo de
flujos. La presencia de líneas neutras parece afectar de forma notable
el comportamiento de los flujos de plasma impidiendo la aparición de
flujos de foso.

#### Futuros estudios

Datos provenientes del telescopio HINODE y de nuevos instrumentos y
misiones como SUNRISE, permitirán tener muchos más ejemplos de series
temporales estables, de alta resolución espacial y temporal, sobre las
cuales se podrá estudiar la dinámica de las estructuras en las zonas
activas para verificar los hallazgos presentados en este trabajo. El
análisis de series de magnetogramas y dopplergramas simultáneas a series
en banda G, enriquecerán indudablemente nuestro entendimiento de la
relación entre el flujo Evershed dentro de la penumbra y el flujo de
foso alrededor de las manchas solares.

Sin duda el estudio de manchas en diferentes estados evolutivos donde la
penumbra ha sido recientemente formada o esta en fase de disolución, es
de vital importancia para validar los resultados y conclusiones que se
exponen en el presente trabajo.

De igual forma aquellos resultados aportados por nuevos estudios de
heliosismologia local, en particular los relacionados con los modos-f (
Gizon et al. , 2000 ) tendientes a describir el patrón de flujos a
diferentes profundidades bajo las manchas solares y sus regiones
circundantes, serán cruciales para establecer una clara relación entre
estos dos flujos: dentro y fuera de la penumbra. La interpretación los
flujos de foso en términos de celdas convectivas de gran escala
alrededor de las manchas (ver Bovelet & Wiehr , 2003 ) puede cambiar
radicalmente si el flujo Evershed resultara ser el principal proceso que
inyecta masa en las regiones moat alrededor de las manchas solares.

Creemos que uno de los resultados mas relevantes que se defienden en
este trabajo y que supone que el flujo de foso es una continuación,
fuera de la penumbra, del flujo Evershed, merece especial atención en el
futuro tanto desde el punto de vista observacional como del teórico.
