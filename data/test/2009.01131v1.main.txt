## Chapter 1 Introduction

Relativistic quantum field theory gives a powerful framework to describe
all known elementary particles to a good accuracy (see [ 7 , 8 ] for
reviews). At present, our theoretical understanding of the fundamental
interactions of Nature is based on the Standard Model of particle
physics and Einstein’s theory of gravity. The Standard Model accounts
for three of the four fundamental interactions, i.e. the
electromagnetic, weak and strong forces. It is a renormalisable quantum
field theory, and is described in terms of the Yang-Mills gauge fields
coupled to some matter sector, with the gauge group @xmath . All the
fundamental particles encoded in such a formulation have spin @xmath .
Gravity is described by general relativity at the classical level, which
is a non-Abelian gauge theory of a spin-2 field possessing a
diffeomorphism invariance. While the gravitational interaction is
irrelevant at the energy scale of the Standard Model, quantum
gravitational effects are not negligible at the Planck scale, which is
of the order of @xmath GeV. Since general relativity is
non-renormalisable, one of the main challenges of modern theoretical
physics is to reconcile quantum field theory and general relativity in
order to arrive at a consistent quantum theory of gravity. Given that
the regions associated to the Planck energy are not directly accessible
using existing experiments, the development of this subject has been
mainly driven by symmetry principles and other theoretical ideas.

Supersymmetry in four dimensions was discovered by Golfand and Likhtman
[ 9 ] , Volkov and Akulov [ 10 ] , and Wess and Zumino [ 11 ] . It is a
symmetry relating two types of particles in Nature, bosons and fermions,
which were previously unrelated in field theories. The generators of
supersymmetry transformations are fermionic, thus they obey
anticommutation relations. The supersymmetric extension of the Poincaré
group is known as @xmath -extended super-Poincaré group. This involves
the addition of @xmath Majorana spinor generators to the generators of
the Poincaré algebra, where @xmath is a positive integer.

Despite the lack of experimental evidence, supersymmetry remains
attractive for its phenomenological and theoretical applications. It
offers some solutions to long standing problems, such as the hierarchy
problem, gauge unification, etc, see e.g. [ 12 ] for a review. On the
theoretical side, it is interesting to study a supersymmetric extension
of general relativity ¹ ¹ 1 As discovered by Volkov and Soroka [ 13 ] ,
gauging the @xmath super-Poincaré group leads to the supergravity action
with nonlinearly realised local supersymmetry. , which is supergravity [
14 , 15 ] . The latter is the gauge theory of supersymmetry. It arises
if one makes supersymmetry transformations local, with the gravitino
(spin 3/2) being the corresponding gauge field. Its superpartner, the
graviton (spin 2), is associated to the diffeomorphism invariance.
Supergravity multiplet consists of the graviton and @xmath gravitino
fields (for @xmath , the multiplet also contains some vector and scalar
fields).

Supergravity has some remarkable properties, see [ 17 , 16 ] for
reviews. Most notably, it is a low-energy limit of superstring theory
(see [ 18 , 19 ] for reviews), which is currently the leading candidate
to give a unified description of the four fundamental forces.
Superstring theory includes in its spectrum an infinite tower of massive
higher-spin excitations, which lead to improved ultraviolet behaviour of
the theory. In recent years, there has also been an incredibly
productive area of research to understand the relationship between
supergravity and the dynamics of such higher-spin states. In the past,
most of the studies were restricted to @xmath case. Theories with @xmath
would include massless fields with higher-spin (helicity) @xmath , and
at that time it was not known how to couple such fields consistently to
gravity [ 20 ] .

The study of higher-spin fields has been carried out quite independently
of string theory, initiated in the works of Dirac [ 21 ] , Fierz and
Pauli [ 22 ] , Rarita and Schwinger [ 23 ] and many others. As follows
from Wigner’s classification [ 24 ] , free elementary particles are
associated with the unitary irreducible representations of the Poincaré
group, the latter are classified by mass and spin. In any physical
system, the spin can take arbitrary integer or half-integer values. The
term “higher-spin” refers to fields with spin @xmath , which are
higher-rank tensor representations of the Poincaré group. Of particular
interest are massless higher-spin fields and their gauge symmetries
underlying their dynamics, which pose challenges in the construction of
interaction vertices. We now provide a brief historical overview of
higher-spin theory, see e.g. [ 20 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 ] for complete
reviews.

Despite the pioneering works of Dirac [ 21 ] , Fierz and Pauli [ 22 ]
who formulated relativistic wave equations for free massive fields of
arbitrary spin, it took over thirty years until the corresponding
Lagrangian description were constructed by Singh and Hagen [ 29 , 30 ] .
In the massless limit, consistent Lagrangians were constructed in 4D
flat and (anti)-de Sitter ((A)dS) spaces. They were proposed by Fronsdal
[ 31 , 32 ] in the bosonic case, and by Fang and Fronsdal for fermionic
fields [ 33 , 34 ] . Section 6.9 of [ 35 ] contains a pedagogical review
of the (Fang-)Fronsdal actions in Minkowski space [ 31 , 33 ] in the
two-component spinor formalism. ² ² 2 Such a formalism will be used in
this thesis. Not only is this formalism useful for higher-spin
calculations, but it is also well adopted to the framework of
supersymmetry.

Constructing consistent deformations of Fronsdal’s Lagrangian, which
should lead to fully interacting higher-spin gauge theories, proved to
be very challenging. This was due to a large number of highly
restrictive no-go theorems (e.g. [ 36 , 37 , 38 ] ) which, under certain
assumptions, rule out any gravitational interactions of massless
higher-spin fields in flat space. In the 1980s, several cubic vertices
for higher-spin fields interacting with each other were constructed in
flat space [ 39 , 40 , 41 ] . It was also observed that any consistent
interacting theory must involve fields of all spins and higher
derivative terms.

The first successful result on higher-spin gravitational interactions
was achieved by Fradkin and Vasiliev in 1987 [ 42 ] . They constructed a
Lagrangian describing consistent cubic vertices in the presence of a
cosmological term, i.e. in an (A)dS background where the no-go results
can be evaded. This line of research culminated in Vasiliev’s unfolded
formulation [ 43 ] , in which the fully interacting theories were
described in terms of consistent nonlinear equations of motion for an
infinite spectrum of higher-spin fields. This was later extended to
arbitrary spacetime dimensions [ 44 ] . However, one of the issues is
that a Lagrangian formulation for these nonlinear theories is still
unknown, thus constraining our understanding of their quantum
properties.

Since the early 1990s, higher-spin gauge theory has been an intense
field of research in modern theoretical and mathematical physics. That
AdS space is the natural setup for interacting higher-spin fields has
motivated further studies in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence,
leading to some conjectures relating higher-spin theories to weakly
coupled conformal field theories [ 46 , 45 ] . There are many other
important research directions in higher-spin theory, such as the
unfolded formulation, (topologically) massive higher-spin, BRST
approach, etc (see e.g. [ 20 , 25 , 26 , 48 , 47 , 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 ]
and the references therein). As mentioned previously, a major motivation
for current research stems from its close connection with (super)string
theory. It is conjectured that the latter is a spontaneously broken
phase of a massless higher-spin theory. In this respect, it is of
interest to study supersymmetric extensions of the massless higher-spin
fields of [ 32 , 34 ] .

A powerful approach to construct supersymmetric field theories makes use
of the concept of superspace. Volkov and Akulov [ 53 ] introduced an
@xmath -extended superspace in the framework of nonlinear realisations.
Salam and Strathdee [ 54 ] proposed to use superspace and superfields,
as tools to construct and study supersymmetric theories. Superspace is
an extension of spacetime by anticommuting (Grassmann) coordinates,
while superfields are functions of the superspace coordinates. One has
to impose certain constraints on superfields to describe irreducible
representations of the @xmath -extended super-Poincaré algebra, known as
supermultiplets. A series expansion of a superfield in the Grassmann
coordinates will be finite due to their anticommuting nature. The
coefficients in such an expansion correspond to component fields of the
superfield, which are ordinary bosonic and fermionic functions of
spacetime coordinates. A supersymmetric theory is written compactly in
terms of superfields, thus supersymmetry is kept manifest. Throughout
this thesis, we will employ the superspace approach. For a thorough
introduction to this formalism, the reader is referred to [ 35 , 55 , 56
] .

In general, the superspace approach is not widely used by higher-spin
practitioners. This thesis is primarily devoted to higher-spin
multiplets of conserved currents in supersymmetric field theories. As
first shown by Ferrara and Zumino [ 57 ] , the conserved energy-momentum
tensor and spin-vector supersymmetry current(s) associated with the
supertranslations are embedded in a supermultiplet, called the
supercurrent. It should be pointed out that this multiplet of currents
is always off-shell ³ ³ 3 A supermultiplet is called off-shell if the
algebra of supersymmetry transformations closes off the mass shell, i.e.
without imposing the equations of motion. Otherwise, the supermultiplet
under consideration is called on-shell. by construction [ 58 ] . Given
an on-shell superfield, one may construct another multiplet by taking
bilinear combinations of the component fields of the superfield. One
then considers their variations under supersymmetry transformations to
find the other components of the composite multiplet. The on-shell
condition is not preserved when taking such products. The resulting
multiplet of bilinears thus forms an off-shell multiplet. An example for
this is the supercurrent, which is a composite of the underlying
on-shell matter superfield. Off-shell supermultiplets require auxiliary
fields in their description. In order to efficiently formulate off-shell
supersymmetric theories, superspace techniques are absolutely essential,
since all the appropriate auxiliary fields are included automatically.

Off-shell massless higher-spin supermultiplets
In 4D @xmath supersymmetric field theory, a massless superspin- @xmath (
@xmath ) multiplet describes two ordinary massless fields of spin @xmath
and @xmath . Such a supermultiplet is often denoted by @xmath . The
three lowest superspin values, @xmath and @xmath , correspond to the
vector, gravitino and supergravity multiplets, respectively.

It follows from first principles that the sum of two actions for free
massless spin- @xmath and spin- @xmath fields should possess an on-shell
supersymmetry. Thus, there is no problem of constructing on-shell
massless higher-spin supermultiplets ( @xmath ), for one only needs to
work out the supersymmetry transformations leaving invariant the pair of
(Fang-)Fronsdal actions [ 31 , 33 ] . In four dimensions, this task was
completed first by Curtright [ 59 ] who made use of the (Fang-)Fronsdal
actions, and soon after by Vasiliev [ 60 ] with his frame-like
reformulation of the (Fang-)Fronsdal models. The nontrivial problem,
however, is to construct off-shell massless higher-spin supermultiplets.
Early attempts to construct such off-shell realisations [ 61 , 62 ] were
unsuccessful, as explained in detail in [ 63 ] .

The problem of constructing gauge off-shell superfield realisations for
free massless higher-spin supermultiplets was solved in the early 1990s
by Kuzenko, Postnikov and Sibiryakov [ 64 , 65 ] . For each superspin
value @xmath , half-integer [ 64 ] and integer [ 65 ] , these
publications provided two dually equivalent off-shell actions formulated
in 4D @xmath Minkowski superspace. At the component level, each of the
two superspin- @xmath actions [ 64 , 65 ] reduces, upon imposing a
Wess-Zumino-type gauge and eliminating the auxiliary fields, to a sum of
the spin- @xmath and spin- @xmath actions [ 31 , 33 ] . The models [ 64
, 65 ] thus provided the first manifestly supersymmetric extensions of
the (Fang-)Fronsdal actions for massless higher-spin fields. A
pedagogical review of the results obtained in [ 64 , 65 ] can be found
in section 6.9 of [ 35 ] . In [ 63 ] , the massless higher-superspin
theories of [ 64 , 65 ] were generalised to 4D @xmath AdS superspace,
@xmath , and their quantisation was carried out in [ 66 ] . Building on
the @xmath analysis, off-shell massless @xmath supermultiplets were
proposed in [ 67 ] . Models describing off-shell @xmath superconformal
higher-spin multiplets were constructed in [ 68 ] , which made use of
the gauge prepotentials introduced in [ 69 ] .

The structure of the (Fang-)Fronsdal gauge-invariant actions and their
@xmath supersymmetric counterparts of half-integer superspin share one
common feature. For each of them, the action is written in terms of two
multiplets: a (super)conformal gauge (super)field coupled to certain
compensators. The (Fang-)Fronsdal actions [ 31 , 33 ] can be interpreted
as gauge-invariant models described by the Fradkin-Tseytlin conformal
gauge fields [ 70 , 71 ] and an appropriate set of compensators. ⁴ ⁴ 4
See the beginning of chapter 3 for the details. The massless
half-integer superspin actions of [ 64 ] involve not only the real
superconformal gauge prepotential [ 68 ] , but also some complex
compensating superfields. Such a description was previously unknown for
the massless multiplet of integer superspin [ 65 ] . This was the
motivation for the recent work [ 2 ] , where we proposed a new off-shell
formulation for the massless multiplet of integer superspin. Its
properties are: (i) the gauge freedom matches that of the complex
superconformal integer superspin multiplet introduced in [ 68 ] ; and
(ii) the action involves two compensating multiplets, in addition to the
superconformal integer superspin multiplet. Upon imposing a partial
gauge fixing, this action reduces to the so-called longitudinal
formulation for the integer superspin [ 65 ] . This construction was
later lifted to @xmath AdS supersymmetry [ 3 ] .

(Higher-spin) supercurrents
As previously pointed out, the concept of supercurrent was introduced by
Ferrara and Zumino [ 57 ] in the context of @xmath supersymmetry. This
was later extended to 4D @xmath supersymmetry by Sohnius [ 72 ] .

The multiplet of currents in superconformal field theories has a simpler
structure. The @xmath conformal supercurrent multiplet contains the
symmetric traceless energy-momentum tensor @xmath , the spin-vector
supersymmetry current @xmath and the @xmath -symmetry ( i.e. @xmath )
current @xmath .

In the non-superconformal case (e.g. @xmath Poincaré supersymmetric
theories), the supercurrent multiplet also includes the trace multiplet
containing the trace of the energy-momentum tensor and the @xmath -trace
of the supersymmetry current. In some cases, the trace multiplet also
contains the divergence of the @xmath current, @xmath . Different
supersymmetric theories may possess different trace multiplets. This
means that the problem of classifying inequivalent non-conformal
supercurrent multiplets needs to be addressed. Ten years ago, there
appeared numerous papers devoted to studying consistent @xmath
supercurrents in four dimensions [ 73 , 74 , 75 , 76 , 77 , 78 , 79 ] .

Supercurrent can be viewed as the source of supergravity [ 80 , 81 ] ,
in complete analogy with the energy-momentum tensor as the source of
gravity. This idea proves to be powerful in deriving various consistent
supercurrents. Given a linearised off-shell supergravity action, the
supercurrent conservation equation is obtained by coupling the
supergravity prepotentials to external sources and demanding invariance
of the resulting action under the linearised supergravity gauge
transformations. Using this procedure, the general structure of
consistent supercurrents are presented in [ 77 , 78 , 82 ] for @xmath
and @xmath super-Poincaré cases in four dimensions, and in [ 83 ] for
@xmath supersymmetric theories in three dimensions.

On the other hand, supercurrent can be used to deduce the off-shell
structure of a massless supermultiplet which is associated to it. The
procedure to follow is concisely described by Bergshoeff et al. [ 58 ] :
“One first assigns a field to each component of the current multiplet,
and forms a generalised inner product of field and current components.”
Indeed, this approach has been used in the past to construct off-shell
supergravity multiplets in diverse dimensions [ 58 , 72 , 88 , 84 , 85 ,
86 , 87 ] . The point is that the currents always form an off-shell
multiplet, thus the fields to which they couple must also be off-shell.
For example, in [ 72 ] the @xmath supercurrent for the massive
hypermultiplet model was used to derive the minimal multiplet of @xmath
Poincaré supergravity.

All off-shell formulations for @xmath Poincaré supergravity are
described in terms of the real gravitational superfield @xmath [ 80 ]
and a compensator. The gravitational superfield couples to the
supercurrent @xmath , while the source associated with the compensator
is the trace multiplet. Thus, different choices of compensator lead to
variant non-conformal supercurrents. Since the linearised off-shell
@xmath supergravity actions have been classified [ 89 ] , all minimal
consistent supercurrents are readily derivable [ 77 ] . Reducible
supercurrents, such as the @xmath -multiplet introduced by Komargodski
and Seiberg [ 76 ] , can be obtained by combining some of the minimal
ones.

Various aspects of field theories with @xmath AdS supersymmetry have
been studied in detail over the last forty years, see e.g. [ 97 , 90 ,
91 , 93 , 92 , 96 , 95 , 94 , 98 ] and references therein. The works of
Ivanov and Sorin [ 93 , 92 ] are fundamental in the development of
superfield techniques. They classified off-shell superfield
representations of the @xmath group ( i.e. the isometry group of @xmath
). Furthermore, they constructed @xmath -invariant actions generalising
the Wess-Zumino model and @xmath super Yang-Mills theory.

The structure of consistent supercurrent multiplets in @xmath [ 100 , 99
] considerably differs from that in the @xmath super-Poincaré case [ 77
, 73 ] . There exist three minimal supercurrents with @xmath degrees of
freedom in Minkowski superspace [ 77 ] . As discussed in [ 99 ] , there
are only two irreducible AdS supercurrents: minimal @xmath and
non-minimal @xmath , which are related via a well-defined improvement
transformation [ 99 ] . The minimal supercurrent is the AdS extension of
the Ferrara-Zumino supercurrent [ 57 ] .

We remark that these consistent AdS supercurrents are closely related to
two classes of supersymmetric gauge theories: (i) the known off-shell
formulations for pure @xmath AdS supergravity, minimal (see e.g. [ 56 ,
35 ] for reviews) and non-minimal [ 99 ] ; and (ii) the two dually
equivalent series of massless higher-spin supermultiplets in AdS [ 63 ]
. More precisely, the minimal supercurrent is associated with the
longitudinal action @xmath for a massless superspin-3/2 multiplet in
AdS. The non-minimal supercurrent is associated with the dual
formulation @xmath . The functional @xmath proves to be the linearised
action for minimal @xmath AdS supergravity. The dual action @xmath
results from the linearisation around the AdS background of non-minimal
@xmath AdS supergravity. Both actions represent the lowest superspin
limits of the off-shell massless supermultiplets of half-integer
superspin in AdS [ 63 ] .

Higher-spin supercurrent multiplet is a higher-spin extension of the
ordinary supercurrent. In its component expansion, it contains conserved
bosonic and fermionic currents. Conserved higher-spin currents for
scalar and spinor fields in 4D Minkowski space have been studied in
numerous publications. To the best of our knowledge, the first
construction of currents for both scalar and spinor fields was given by
Kibble [ 101 ] . Migdal [ 102 ] and Makeenko [ 103 ] later also
described the spinor case. Further examples of conserved higher-spin
currents were given in [ 103 , 104 , 105 , 106 , 107 , 108 ] .
Higher-spin extension (in the half-integer superspin case) of the
conformal supercurrent [ 57 ] was proposed more than thirty years ago by
Howe, Stelle and Townsend [ 69 ] . Recently in Ref. [ 68 ] , the
structure of such a supercurrent was described in more detail, and
examples for supercurrents in some superconformal models were also
given. In 3D Minkowski space, explicit constructions of conserved
higher-spin supercurrents in free superconformal theories were obtained
in [ 109 ] .

As regards non-conformal higher-spin supercurrents, their properties had
not been analysed. The primary goal of this thesis is to study the
general structure of non-conformal higher-spin supercurrent multiplets
in three and four dimensions from the viewpoint of off-shell higher-spin
gauge supermultiplets. As demonstrated in [ 77 , 99 , 83 ] , the general
structure of the supercurrents in AdS differ significantly from their
counterparts in Minkowski space. This motivated us to look for
realisations of higher-spin supercurrents in field theories with
Poincaré and AdS supersymmetry.

For this purpose, we developed a higher-spin extension of the general
superfield approach advocated in [ 77 , 83 ] . Here the task was simpler
in four dimensions since such off-shell actions already existed [ 64 ,
65 , 63 ] . In three dimensions, off-shell massless @xmath [ 50 ] and
@xmath [ 49 ] supermultiplets were constructed in Minkowski space, but
only for the half-integer superspin case. In [ 51 ] , there appeared two
off-shell actions corresponding to half-integer and integer @xmath
supermultiplets in AdS. More general off-shell massless higher-spin
supermultiplets in @xmath and @xmath AdS superspaces were presented in [
4 , 5 , 6 ] .

In four dimensions, we only concentrated on off-shell massless
higher-spin multiplets and their associated conserved currents with
@xmath Poincaré and AdS supersymmetry [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] . In three
dimensions, however, we considered both @xmath and @xmath AdS cases [ 4
, 5 , 6 ] . In contrast to the four-dimensional case where pure @xmath
AdS supergravity [ 110 ] is unique on-shell, the specific feature of
three dimensions is the existence of two distinct @xmath AdS
supergravity theories [ 111 , 112 ] . They are known as the (1,1) and
(2,0) AdS supergravity theories, originally constructed as Chern-Simons
theories [ 111 ] . In Ref. [ 83 ] , various aspects of (1,1) and (2,0)
AdS supergravity theories (including the general structure of
supercurrents) were studied in detail, using the superspace formalism
developed by Kuzenko, Lindström and Tartaglino-Mazzucchelli [ 113 ] .
Thus, it is natural to extend the analysis of [ 83 ] to the higher-spin
case [ 4 , 5 ] .

Let us discuss some applications of our results presented in this
thesis. In accordance with the standard Noether method (see e.g. [ 114 ]
for a review), construction of conserved higher-spin supercurrents for
various supersymmetric theories is equivalent to generating consistent
cubic vertices of the type @xmath . Here @xmath denotes some off-shell
higher-spin gauge multiplet, and @xmath is the higher-spin conserved
current multiplet, constructed in terms of some matter multiplets @xmath
and @xmath , and superspace covariant derivatives @xmath . In 4D
Minkowski superspace, several cubic vertices involving the off-shell
higher-spin multiplets of [ 64 , 65 ] were constructed recently [ 115 ,
116 , 117 , 118 , 119 , 120 ] using the superfield Noether procedure [
73 ] . For instance, conserved supercurrents and cubic interactions
between massless higher-spin supermultiplets and a single chiral
superfield were constructed by Buchbinder, Gates and Koutrolikos [ 115 ]
. This analysis was soon extended by Koutrolikos, Koči and von Unge to
study cubic vertices in the case of a free complex linear superfield [
116 ] . The corresponding component higher-spin currents were also
computed [ 116 ] .

Making use of the gauge off-shell formulations for massless higher-spin
supermultiplets of [ 63 ] , higher-spin extensions of the AdS
supercurrents [ 82 ] were formulated in 4D @xmath AdS superspace [ 3 ]
for the first time. Their realisations for various supersymmetric
theories in AdS were also presented, including a model of @xmath massive
chiral scalar superfields with an arbitrary mass matrix. Such a program
was a natural extension of the earlier flat-space results [ 1 , 2 ] , in
which we built on the structure of higher-spin supercurrent multiplets
in models for superconformal chiral superfields [ 68 ] .

In the non-supersymmetric case, conserved higher-spin currents for
scalar fields in AdS were studied, e.g. in [ 121 , 122 , 123 , 124 , 125
] . The nonvanishing curvature of AdS space makes explicit calculations
of conserved higher-spin currents much harder than in Minkowski space.
Refs. [ 121 , 122 ] studied only the conformal scalar, and only the
first order correction to the flat-space expression was given
explicitly. The construction presented in [ 125 ] is more complete since
all conserved higher-spin currents were computed exactly for a free
massive scalar field using the so-called ambient space formulation. All
these works dealt with bosonic currents. The important feature of
supersymmetric theories is that they also possess fermionic currents.
The conserved higher-spin supercurrents computed in [ 3 ] can readily be
reduced to components. This leads to closed-form expressions for
conserved higher-spin bosonic and fermionic currents in models with
massive scalar and spinor fields.

Thesis outline
The purpose of chapter 2 is to introduce various technical aspects and
essential background materials. First, a brief account of the @xmath
superspace formalism of [ 35 ] is given. We then recall the structure of
the non-conformal supercurrent multiplets in 4D @xmath Minkowski and AdS
superspaces following [ 77 , 82 ] . Finally, we briefly review the two
dually equivalent off-shell Lagrangian formulations for massless
multiplets of arbitrary superspin in 4D @xmath Minkowski superspace [ 64
, 65 ] .

Chapter 3 presents a new off-shell formulation for the massless
superspin- @xmath multiplet in 4D @xmath Minkowski superspace, where
@xmath and for the massless gravitino multiplet ( @xmath ). The
non-conformal higher-spin supercurrent multiplets associated with the
massless (half-)integer superspin gauge theories are derived. In
addition, we compute higher-spin supercurrents that originate in the
models for a single massless and massive chiral superfield, as well as
the massive @xmath hypermultiplet. This chapter is based on the original
works [ 1 , 2 ] .

Chapter 4 is concerned with the extension of the flat-space results in
chapter 3 to the case of 4D @xmath AdS supersymmetry. The dual
formulations for massless (half-)integer superspin multiplets in AdS [
63 ] are reviewed and a novel formulation for the massless integer
superspin is proposed. Making use of these gauge off-shell models,
higher-spin supercurrent multiplets are formulated. Their explicit
constructions are presented for various supersymmetric in AdS, including
the case of @xmath chiral scalar superfields with an arbitrary mass
matrix @xmath . We further elaborate on several nontrivial applications
of the construction of higher-spin supercurrents. This chapter is based
on the original work [ 3 ] .

In chapter 5 , we turn our attention to @xmath supersymmetric
higher-spin theories in 3D AdS space. First, some of the important facts
concerning (1,1) and (2,0) AdS superspaces, including superfield
representations of the corresponding isometry groups, are reviewed. By
analogy with our 4D @xmath analysis, we construct two dually equivalent
off-shell Lagrangian formulations for every massless higher-spin
supermultiplet in (1,1) AdS superspace, and subsequently generate
consistent higher-spin supercurrents. In the context of (2,0) AdS
supersymmetry, we begin with some simple supersymmetric models in (2,0)
AdS superspace to deduce a multiplet of conserved higher-spin currents,
from which the corresponding supermultiplet of higher-spin fields can be
determined. This results in two off-shell gauge formulations for a
massless multiplet of half-integer superspin @xmath , for arbitrary
integer @xmath . This chapter is based on the original works [ 4 , 5 ] .

In chapter 6 , a manifestly supersymmetric setting to reduce every field
theory in (2,0) AdS superspace to @xmath AdS superspace is developed. As
nontrivial examples, we consider supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models
described in terms of @xmath chiral and linear supermultiplets. This
(2,0) @xmath (1,0) AdS reduction technique is then applied to our
off-shell massless higher-spin supermultiplets described in chapter 5 .
This results in four series of @xmath supersymmetric higher-spin models
in AdS, two of which are new gauge theories. This chapter is based on
the original work [ 6 ] .

Finally, in chapter 7 we conclude this thesis by summarising its key
outcomes.

There are three appendices. Our notation and conventions are summarised
in appendix A . Appendix B reviews the conserved higher-spin currents
for free @xmath scalars and Majorana spinors with arbitrary mass
matrices. In appendix C , we analyse the component structure of the two
new @xmath supersymmetric higher-spin models constructed in chapter 6 .

## Chapter 2 Field theories in @xmath Minkowski and AdS superspaces

In this chapter we collect some technical background materials required
to understand subsequent chapters. We begin with a brief introduction to
some aspects of field theories in 4D @xmath Minkowski superspace
following [ 35 ] . ¹ ¹ 1 Although we only give a review of 4D @xmath
supersymmetry, most of its structure can be readily generalised to 3D
@xmath super-Poincaré case. The next two sections are intended to
illustrate the differences between supercurrent multiplets with @xmath
Poincaré and AdS supersymmetry [ 77 , 99 , 100 ] . Finally, we review
the off-shell formulations for massless higher-spin @xmath
supermultiplets in Minkowski space, which were developed in [ 64 , 65 ]
.

### 2.1 Field theories in @xmath Minkowski superspace

A more detailed and pedagogical introduction to various aspects covered
in this section can be found in [ 35 , 55 , 56 ] . Our 4D notation and
conventions are essentially those of [ 35 ] and are summarised in
appendix A .

#### 2.1.1 The Poincaré superalgebra

The simplest supersymmetric extension of the Poincaré group in four
dimensions is the @xmath super-Poincaré group. Associated to this
super-Lie group is the @xmath Poincaré superalgebra [ 9 ] with the
following (anti-)commutation relations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (2.1.1)
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- ---------

Here @xmath and @xmath denote the generators of the translation and
Lorentz group, respectively. The supersymmetry generators @xmath are
Weyl spinors which transform respectively as @xmath and @xmath of the
Lorentz group. The automorphism group ( @xmath -symmetry group) of the
@xmath Poincaré superalgebra ( 2.1.1 ) is @xmath , which act on the
supercharges in the following way

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In the extended ( @xmath ) supersymmetry case, the @xmath -symmetry
group is @xmath .

#### 2.1.2 @xmath Minkowski superspace

We denote the 4D @xmath Minkowski superspace [ 53 , 54 ] by @xmath . It
can be identified with the coset space

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Here @xmath is the @xmath super-Poincaré group, and @xmath is the double
cover of the restricted Lorentz subgroup @xmath . Any element of the
supergroup @xmath can be represented in an exponential form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The points of the coset space @xmath are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Thus, @xmath can be parametrised by the local coordinates @xmath , where
@xmath are real commuting numbers and @xmath are complex anticommuting
numbers.

The action of supersymmetry transformations on the superspace
coordinates can be determined using the algebra ( 2.1.1 ). It is given
by

  -- -- -- -------- -------- ---------
           @xmath            (2.1.6)
           @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -- -- -------- -------- ---------

from which we can read off

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

One may also compute the action of translations, @xmath , and Lorentz
transformations, @xmath , in a similar manner. The result is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.1.8)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the well-known homomorphism given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

#### 2.1.3 Superfields

Supersymmetric field theories on superspace are naturally formulated in
terms of tensor superfields. A tensor superfield @xmath of Lorentz type
@xmath is a superfield carrying @xmath undotted and @xmath dotted spinor
indices, which are separately symmetrised. Furthermore, it transforms in
the following way under the action of an infinitesimal @xmath
super-Poincaré group (note that we have suppressed its tensor indices):

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The generators take the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.1.11a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.1.11b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.1.11c)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.1.11d)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

We have also introduced the following notation:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We denote the set of covariant derivatives of @xmath Minkowski
superspace by
@xmath , which have the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

They obey the (anti)commutation relations ² ² 2 See appendix A for some
important properties of the covariant derivatives.

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (2.1.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The latter indicates that flat superspace has non-vanishing torsion.

Expanding a tensor superfield @xmath with respect to its fermionic
coordinates @xmath , one obtains its corresponding component fields as
the coefficients of the series. Due to the property @xmath , such a
series will be finite. As an example, consider a Taylor expansion of a
real scalar superfield, @xmath , but otherwise unconstrained:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.1.15)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

To get insight into the physical content of the superfield @xmath , a
more systematic and convenient way is to use space projection (also
often called bar-projection in some literature) and covariant
differentiation. By space projection we mean the zeroth order term in
the power series expansion in @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In the case of a real scalar superfield above, we may define the
components using the bar-projection:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (2.1.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In addition, one may work out how the component fields transform under
the infinitesimal supersymmetry transformations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

by taking various numbers of covariant derivatives of ( 2.1.18 ) and
then bar-project them. One should also note that the supersymmetry
generator anticommutes with the spinor covariant derivatives, which
implies @xmath .

In appendix C we will describe in more detail the 3D @xmath analogue of
the above component reduction. Such a procedure is useful to study the
field contents of some supersymmetric higher-spin models.

An unconstrained superfield is a reducible representation of
supersymmetry. In order to obtain an irreducible representation, we need
to impose certain constraints on the superfield which are also
consistent with the supersymmetry transformations. This can be done with
the help of the covariant derivatives @xmath . The simplest example is
the chirality constraint,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.1.19)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

with @xmath being a complex scalar superfield. It can be shown that the
above constraint implies that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In order to see this, one may act on both sides of ( 2.1.19 ) with the
operator @xmath , and make use of the identity

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

It follows from ( 2.1.20 ) that @xmath is independent of @xmath , so it
can be written as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

for an arbitrary superfield @xmath . Thus, the solution to the chirality
constraint ( 2.1.19 ) is given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

A superfield of the form ( 2.1.23 ), which depends only on @xmath , is
called chiral superfield.

Analogously, one can also impose the anti-chirality constraint

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.1.24)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

which is solved by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In contrast to the chiral superfield ( 2.1.23 ), we see that the
anti-chiral superfield essentially depends on @xmath only. Any function
of a chiral superfield only is also chiral, that is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The same goes with anti-chiral superfield.

The component structure of a chiral superfield can be studied by first
decomposing @xmath in terms of @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

or, equivalently

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.28)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As a result, we have that

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.1.29)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

The component fields of an anti-chiral superfield can be worked out from
( 2.1.29 ) by conjugation.

There are other types of constrained superfields, such as complex linear
and real linear superfields. They will be described in section 2.2 .

#### 2.1.4 Supersymmetric action principle

In superspace formalism, any supersymmetric field theory is described by
a set of superfields, with the corresponding action functional written
as an integral over the superspace of a Lagrangian superfield @xmath .
The (classical) superfield equations of motion can be obtained using a
supersymmetric action principle.

Let us first understand some basics of integration over the
anticommuting coordinates ( @xmath ), which was first given by Berezin [
126 ] . The Berezin integral is equivalent to differentiation. We
further note some properties:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.30)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Similarly,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.31)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The measure of full @xmath Minkowski superspace is denoted @xmath ,
while the measures on chiral and antichiral subspaces are given by
@xmath and @xmath respectively.

There are many useful properties of integration in full superspace or
chiral subspace. First, for an arbitrary superfield @xmath , we have
that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.32)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Integration in an (anti-)chiral subspace can be reduced to Minkowski
space,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.1.33a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.1.33b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

Given an integration in full superspace, it can be written either in
(anti-)chiral subspace or Minkowski space:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The most general supersymmetric action functional takes the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.35)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Here @xmath is a real scalar superfield, while @xmath and @xmath are
chiral and anti-chiral scalar superfields, respectively. Performing
integration over all the Grassmann variables in ( 2.1.35 ) results in
component form of the action, which is expressed as an integral over the
4D Minkowski space. This procedure yields

  -- -- -- ----------
           (2.1.36)
  -- -- -- ----------

For completeness, let us prove the invariance of ( 2.1.35 ) under the
@xmath super-Poincare transformations. We will explicitly show this for
the first term. The invariance of the (anti-)chiral action can also be
proved in a similar way. For this we vary the Lagrangian @xmath , which
is a scalar superfield according to the rule ( 2.1.18 ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.1.37)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

i.e. the Lagrangian changes by a total spacetime derivative.

Consider a simple superfield model for a free massless chiral scalar
superfield @xmath . Its action is given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.38)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The superfield equations of motion can be derived by varying the action
with respect to @xmath , which is defined as an integral over the chiral
subspace. This leads to @xmath . Similarly, one gets @xmath by varying
the anti-chiral superfield @xmath . Recalling the definition of the
components of @xmath given in ( 2.1.28 ), the corresponding component
action is easily found to be

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.39)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The component fields @xmath and @xmath are auxiliary fields. They enter
the action without derivatives (or kinetic terms), thus they have no
non-trivial dynamics. One further finds that the component fields @xmath
(and their conjugates) transform linearly under the infinitesimal
supersymmetry transformations:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.1.40)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

Suppose the auxiliary fields @xmath are eliminated through their
equations of motion (in this case it is @xmath ). Computing the
commutators of two infinitesimal supersymmetry transformations, one
finds that the supersymmetry algebra is broken when the auxiliary fields
are eliminated. More precisely, the result is of the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.41)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with @xmath . This algebra is closed only on the equations of motion for
spinor fields @xmath . Therefore, the supersymmetry algebra in the
theory without auxiliary fields is closed only on-shell (on equations of
motion). This explains the role of auxiliary fields, which are to ensure
off-shell closure of the supersymmetry algebra on the component fields.

### 2.2 Linearised @xmath Poincaré supergravity and variant
supercurrents

Given an @xmath supersymmetric theory, one can derive the conserved
spin-vector current associated to rigid supersymmetry. By computing
Noether currents in the massive Wess-Zumino model, Ferrara and Zumino
demonstrated that the conserved energy-momentum tensor @xmath and the
spin-vector current @xmath belong to a supermultiplet, called the
supercurrent [ 57 ] . Additionally, the supercurrent contains the axial
@xmath current, @xmath , which is only conserved for a theory with
@xmath symmetry. The trace of the energy-momentum tensor, the
gamma-trace of the spinor current @xmath , and the axial current
divergence @xmath form a smaller supermultiplet, i.e. the trace
supermultiplet (also called supertrace).

For 4D @xmath supersymmetric theories in Minkowski space, the most
general supercurrent multiplet is subject to the following conservation
law [ 77 , 78 ]

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.1)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- ---------

Here the real vector superfield @xmath is the supercurrent. The chiral
superfields @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are the trace supermultiplets.

Depending on supersymmetric theories, some of the trace supermultiplets
might vanish. In the case of superconformal theories, we can set all of
them to zero. The three terms on the right-hand side of ( 2.2.1 )
correspond to the fact that there exist exactly three linearised
off-shell formulations for minimal (12+12) @xmath Poincaré supergravity,
which have been studied in [ 89 ] . These off-shell models are related
by duality transformations, i.e. they are equivalent on-shell. More
precisely, the authors of [ 89 ] classified the following off-shell
@xmath superfield models for linearised supergravity: (i) three minimal
formulations with (12+12) off-shell degrees of freedom; (ii) three
reducible realisations with (16+16) components; and (iii) one
non-minimal formulation with (20+20) components. Each formulation
corresponds to a different way of gauge-fixing @xmath conformal
supergravity to describe Poincaré supergravity (see [ 35 , 56 ] for
reviews). These seven supergravity models give rise to variant
supercurrent multiplets.

We recall that @xmath Poincaré supergravity [ 14 , 15 ] describes
interacting spin-2 @xmath (the graviton) and spin-3/2 fields @xmath (the
gravitino), with local translational and supersymmetry invariance. All
off-shell formulations for linearised @xmath Poincaré supergravity are
described by two types of dynamical superfields: the real gravitational
gauge superfield @xmath [ 80 ] and a compensating superfield. Each
off-shell description contains the graviton and gravitino as dynamical
fields, but differs in the set of auxiliary fields. The graviton and
gravitino fields can be identified with the components of @xmath .
Switching to the two-component spinor notation (see appendix A ), they
read

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The real gravitational superfield @xmath has the following linearised
gauge transformation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is an unconstrained spinor superfield. Upon imposing the
Wess-Zumino gauge, the remaining transformations correspond to
superconformal transformations [ 127 ] , see also [ 35 , 56 ] for
reviews. A compensating superfield is required in order to remove this
extra symmetry, and thus describing Poincaré supergravity. The
difference between the off-shell models is thus encoded in the choice of
the compensators.

Let us now focus on the structure of irreducible ³ ³ 3 A supercurrent
multiplet is called irreducible if it is associated with an off-shell
formulation for pure supergravity. supercurrents and the linearised
off-shell minimal supergravity formulations that they correspond to.
There are three irreducible supercurrent multiplets with (12+12)
off-shell degrees of freedom.

-   Setting @xmath leads to the well-known Ferrara-Zumino multiplet [ 57
    ] , which corresponds to the old minimal formulation for @xmath
    supergravity [ 128 , 129 , 130 ] , with the following supergravity
    gauge transformation law:

      -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.2.4)
      -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

    Here @xmath is the chiral compensator, @xmath .

-   The case @xmath is known as the @xmath -multiplet, which exists if
    the model has an @xmath -symmetry. This multiplet corresponds to the
    new minimal supergravity [ 88 ] . New minimal supergravity uses a
    real linear superfield @xmath as a compensator, @xmath . The
    constrained superfield @xmath is the gauge-invariant field strength
    of a chiral spinor potential @xmath

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (2.2.5)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    which is defined modulo gauge freedom

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (2.2.6)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    The gauge transformation law is

      -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.2.7)
      -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

-   The third option with @xmath , corresponds to the Virial multiplet,
    which was studied quite recently [ 131 ] . It corresponds to another
    minimal supergravity theory introduced in [ 132 ] . It might have
    fewer applications because it is known only at linearised level,
    unlike the old and new minimal theories. This theory also makes use
    of a real linear compensator superfield @xmath , which is the
    gauge-invariant field strength of a chiral spinor potential @xmath

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (2.2.8)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    The supergravity transformation is given by

      -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.2.9)
      -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

If only one of the trace multiplets is zero, the supercurrent multiplet
contains bigger (16+16) components and is said to be reducible. The most
famous one is the so-called @xmath -multiplet, introduced by Komargodski
and Seiberg [ 65 ] . The @xmath -multiplet is subject to the
conservation equation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (2.2.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

It has been shown in [ 89 ] that such models with 16+16 off-shell
degrees of freedom can be written as a sum of two of the three minimal
models discussed above.

Let us show how to derive a supercurrent multiplet and its conservation
equation, starting from a linearised off-shell formulation for @xmath
supergravity, for instance the old minimal supergravity. This approach
is based on [ 77 ] , in which variant @xmath supercurrent multiplets are
derived. The analysis for the other formulations should be analogous.
First, the following linearised action [ 56 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.2.11)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

is invariant under the linearised gauge transformations ( 2.2 ) of the
supergravity prepotentials. Next, we consider the following coupling of
the dynamical variables to external sources

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Demanding invariance of the above action under ( 2.2 ), it is
straightforward to show that the sources @xmath and @xmath must satisfy
the conservation equation ( 2.2.1 ), that is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In the case of conformal supergravity, the coupling becomes very simple

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which leads to the conservation condition

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

as a consequence of imposing invariance under ( 2.2.3 ). The independent
components of the conformal supercurrent @xmath are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Here @xmath is the @xmath -symmetry current, which is not always
conserved. The supersymmetry current @xmath and the energy-momentum
tensor @xmath are conserved,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Let us look at some simple supersymmetric theories in which the above
(non-)conformal supercurrents are realised. We first consider a
superconformal model for a massless chiral scalar @xmath , with action

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This theory is characterised by the conformal supercurrent [ 57 ]

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which obeys the conservation equation ( 2.2.15 ), provided the matter
superfield is put on-shell: @xmath .

A single massive chiral superfield can be coupled to the old minimal
supergravity, which is reflected in the existence of the Ferrara-Zumino
supercurrent [ 57 ] . A massive chiral superfield is described by the
action

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

For this model, @xmath can be chosen to have the same functional form as
in the massless case, eq. ( 2.2.18 ) ⁴ ⁴ 4 This follows from the fact
that the gravitational superfield does not couple to the superpotential
[ 133 ] . . The trace multiplet is given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

It may be shown that the conservation equation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

holds on the use of the massive equations of motion

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As explained in [ 79 ] , the Ferrara-Zumino supercurrent multiplet is
not well defined in some supersymmetric theories. On the other hand, the
@xmath -multiplet always exists in all known rigid supersymmetric
theories in Minkowski space.

Given real scalar superfields @xmath and @xmath , the non-conformal
supercurrent multiplets ( 2.2.1 ) can be transformed by the rule [ 78 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.2.23a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.2.23b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.2.23c)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.2.23d)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

while keeping the conservation equation ( 2.2.1 ) unchanged. Such a
transformation is called an improvement.

### 2.3 Field theories in @xmath AdS superspace

In four dimensions, @xmath supersymmetry in anti-de Sitter space was
first studied by Keck [ 90 ] , and analysis of its nonlinear
realisations was given by Zumino [ 91 ] . Ivanov and Sorin [ 93 ]
extensively developed the concept of 4D @xmath AdS superspace and
superfield techniques. The @xmath AdS superspace, @xmath , is the
simplest member of the family of @xmath -extended AdS superspaces

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In the following we give a summary of the results which are absolutely
essential for constructing @xmath supersymmetric field theory in AdS in
a manifestly @xmath -invariant way. We mostly follow the presentation in
[ 63 ] . Our notation and two-component spinor conventions agree with [
35 ] , except for the superspace integration measures.

Let @xmath be local coordinates for @xmath . The geometry of @xmath may
be described in terms of covariant derivatives of the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the inverse superspace vielbein, and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is the Lorentz connection. The Lorentz generators @xmath act on
two-component spinors, see appendix A . In particular, they act on the
spinor covariant derivatives by the rule

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

while @xmath . The covariant derivatives of @xmath satisfy the following
algebra

  -- -------- -- ----------
                 
     @xmath      (2.3.5a)
     @xmath      (2.3.5b)
     @xmath      (2.3.5c)
     @xmath      (2.3.5d)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with @xmath being a complex parameter, which is related to the scalar
curvature @xmath of AdS space by the rule @xmath .

The isometry group of @xmath AdS superspace is @xmath . The isometries
transformations of AdS @xmath are generated by the Killing vector fields
@xmath which are defined to solve the Killing equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for some Lorentz superfield parameter @xmath . As shown in [ 35 ] , the
equations in ( 2.3.6 ) are equivalent to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.3.7a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.3.7b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.3.7c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The solution to these equations is given in [ 35 ] . If @xmath is a
tensor superfield (with suppressed indices), its infinitesimal @xmath
transformation is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In Minkowski space, we have seen that there are two ways to generate
supersymmetric invariants, one of which corresponds to the integration
over the full superspace and the other over its chiral subspace. In AdS
superspace, every chiral integral can be always recast as a full
superspace integral. Associated with a scalar superfield @xmath is the
following @xmath invariant

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.3.9)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath denotes the chiral integration measure. ⁵ ⁵ 5 In the chiral
representation [ 35 , 56 ] , the chiral measure is @xmath , where @xmath
is the chiral compensator of old minimal supergravity [ 134 ] . Let
@xmath be a chiral scalar, @xmath . It generates the supersymmetric
invariant @xmath The specific feature of AdS superspace is that the
chiral action can equivalently be written as an integral over the full
superspace [ 134 ]

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Unlike the flat superspace case, the integral on the right does not
vanish in AdS.

### 2.4 Variant supercurrents in AdS space

We now turn to describing the structure of @xmath supercurrent
multiplets in AdS. In contrast to the variant supercurrents in Minkowski
space, there exist only two irreducible AdS supercurrents, with @xmath
and @xmath degrees of freedom [ 100 ] . The former is associated with
the old minimal AdS supergravity (see e.g. [ 35 , 56 ] for reviews).
This supercurrent is the AdS extension of the Ferrara-Zumino multiplet
satisfying the conservation equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.4.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The latter corresponds to non-minimal AdS supergravity [ 99 ] , with the
following conservation law

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.4.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The vector superfields @xmath and @xmath are real.

The non-minimal supercurrent ( 2.4.2 ) is equivalent to the
Ferrara-Zumino multiplet ( 2.4.1 ), since there exists a well-defined
improvement transformation that turns ( 2.4.2 ) into ( 2.4.1 ), as
demonstrated in [ 99 ] . In AdS superspace, the constraint on the trace
multiplet @xmath , @xmath , can always be solved as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.4.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for well-defined real operators @xmath and @xmath . ⁶ ⁶ 6 This follows
from the properties of linear superfields which will be discussed
further in section 4.1 . If we now introduce

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.4.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

then the operators @xmath and @xmath prove to satisfy the conservation
equation ( 2.4.1 ).

For the Ferrara-Zumino supercurrent ( 2.4.1 ), there exists an
improvement transformation that is generated by a chiral scalar operator
@xmath . Specifically, using the operator @xmath allows one to introduce
new supercurrent @xmath and chiral trace multiplet @xmath defined by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.4.5a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.4.5b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The operators @xmath and @xmath obey the conservation equation ( 2.4.1
).

### 2.5 Off-shell higher-spin multiplets: a brief review

In later chapters, we are going to construct higher-spin extensions of
supercurrents in three and four dimensions. For this we require
off-shell formulations for massless higher-spin supermultiplets. In the
framework of 4D @xmath Poincaré and AdS supersymmetry, such gauge
theories have already been developed in a series of papers [ 64 , 65 ,
63 ] . Here we briefly review the constructions in Minkowski space [ 64
, 65 ] . Their AdS counterparts [ 63 ] will be reviewed in the beginning
of chapter 4 .

#### 2.5.1 Massless half-integer superspin multiplets

There exist two dually equivalent off-shell formulations for a free
massless superspin- @xmath multiplet, with @xmath . They are referred to
as transverse and longitudinal formulations [ 64 ] . In these two
off-shell gauge models, the main feature is the use of the so-called
transverse and longitudinal linear superfields as one of the dynamical
variables. Both are complex superfields and subject to different
constraints. More generally, a complex tensor superfield ⁷ ⁷ 7 All
Lorentz tensor (super)fields considered in this thesis are completely
symmetric in their undotted spinor indices and separately in their
dotted ones. We use the shorthand notation @xmath and @xmath .
Parentheses denote symmetrisation of indices; the undotted and dotted
spinor indices are symmetrised independently. Indices sandwiched between
vertical bars (for instance, @xmath ) are not subject to symmetrisation.
@xmath is called transverse linear , if it obeys the constraint

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.5.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

A longitudinal linear superfield @xmath is defined to satisfy the
constraint

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.5.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The above constraints imply that @xmath and @xmath are linear
superfields,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.5.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In the case @xmath , the constraint ( 2.5.1 ) has to be replaced with
the standard linear constraint @xmath . The constraint ( 2.5.2 ) for
@xmath is the chirality condition @xmath .

In the case of 4D @xmath AdS supersymmetry, longitudinal linear and
transverse linear superfields were first described in [ 93 ] to realise
the irreducible representations of the AdS isometry group @xmath (see [
135 ] for a nice review of the results of [ 93 ] ). In the framework of
4D @xmath conformal supergravity, primary longitudinal linear and
transverse linear supermultiplets were introduced for the first time by
Kugo and Uehara [ 136 ] . Such superfields were used in [ 63 , 64 , 65 ,
49 , 3 , 4 ] for the description of off-shell massless gauge theories in
three and four dimensions.

##### 2.5.1.1 Transverse formulation

The transverse formulation is realised in terms of the following
dynamical variables:

  -- -------- -------- -- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath         (2.5.4)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- ---------

Here @xmath is a real unconstrained superfield. The complex superfield
@xmath is transverse linear,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.5.5)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

The constraint ( 2.5.5 ) can be solved in terms of an unconstrained
prepotential:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.5.6)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

The prepotential is defined modulo gauge transformation of the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.5.7)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

with the gauge parameters @xmath being unconstrained.

It was postulated in [ 64 ] that the linearised gauge transformations
for the superfields @xmath and @xmath are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.5.8a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.5.8b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

where the complex gauge parameter @xmath is unconstrained. It follows
from ( 2.5.8b ) that the transformation law of the prepotential @xmath
is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.5.9)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

The action invariant under the gauge transformations ( 2.5.8a ) and (
2.5.8b ) is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.5.10)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

We now briefly comment on the limiting @xmath case which should
correspond to linearised supergravity. The transverse linear constraint
( 2.5.5 ) cannot be used for @xmath , however its corollary @xmath can
be used,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.5.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This constraint defines a complex linear superfield. In accordance with
( 2.5.8b ), the gauge transformation of @xmath is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.5.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The action ( 2.5.10 ) for @xmath coincides with the linearised action
for the @xmath non-minimal supergravity, see [ 89 , 35 ] for reviews.

##### 2.5.1.2 Longitudinal formulation

The longitudinal formulation is described in terms of the following
dynamical variables:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.5.13)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

where the real superfield @xmath is unconstrained, and the compensating
superfield @xmath is longitudinal linear,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.5.14)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The constraint ( 2.5.14 ) can be solved in terms of an unconstrained
prepotential

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.5.15)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The prepotential is defined modulo gauge transformations of the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.5.16)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

with the gauge parameter @xmath being unconstrained. ⁸ ⁸ 8 For @xmath
the gauge transformation law ( 2.5.16 ) has to be replaced with @xmath ,
with the gauge parameter @xmath being chiral, @xmath .

The gauge transformations for the dynamical superfields are given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------
                                         
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.5.17a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.5.17b)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------

The symmetrisation in ( 2.5.17b ) is extended only to the indices @xmath
. It follows from ( 2.5.17b ) that the transformation law of the
prepotential @xmath is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.5.18)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The action invariant under the gauge transformations ( 2.5.17a ) and (
2.5.17b ) is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.5.19)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

The models ( 2.5.10 ) and ( 2.5.19 ) are dually equivalent in a sense
that they are related by a superfield Legendre transformation described
in [ 64 ] . In general, the procedure works as follows. Let us start
with the transverse theory ( 2.5.10 ) and associate with it the
following first-order action

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.5.20)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

with @xmath being unconstrained complex. Here @xmath is obtained from
@xmath by the replacement @xmath . The Lagrange multiplier @xmath is
longitudinal linear. Varying the first-order action @xmath with respect
to the Lagrange multiplier @xmath gives @xmath , thus @xmath reduces to
the original action @xmath . On the other hand, one can integrate out
@xmath using its equation of motion

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.5.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We assume that ( 2.5.21 ) can be solved to express @xmath in terms of
@xmath and its conjugate. Plugging this solution back into ( 2.5.20 )
leads to the dual action @xmath , given by the expression ( 2.5.19 ).

The constraint ( 2.5.14 ) is the chirality condition for @xmath , @xmath
. The gauge transformation law ( 2.5.17b ) cannot directly be used for
@xmath . Nevertheless, it can be rewritten in the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.5.22)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

which is well defined for @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.5.23)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The action ( 2.5.19 ) for @xmath coincides with the linearised action
for the old minimal supergravity, see [ 89 , 35 ] for reviews.

#### 2.5.2 Massless integer superspin multiplets

We now recall the two off-shell gauge models for a massless multiplet of
integer superspin @xmath , which were originally constructed in [ 65 ] .
In each of the formulations, the dynamical variables consist of a real
unconstrained prepotential @xmath in conjunction with some compensating
supermultiplets.

##### 2.5.2.1 Longitudinal formulation

The longitudinal theory is described by the following set of superfields

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.5.24)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The superfield @xmath is unconstrained real, while the compensator
@xmath is longitudinal linear. The latter is a field strength associated
with a complex unconstrained prepotential @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.5.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The dynamical superfields are defined modulo gauge transformations of
the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.5.26a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.5.26b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

with the gauge parameter @xmath being complex unconstrained. The action
functional which is quadratic in the superfields @xmath and invariant
under the gauge transformations ( 2.5.26 ) is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.5.27)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

##### 2.5.2.2 Transverse formulation

The transverse formulation is realised by the following set of
superfields

  -- -------- -------- -- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath         (2.5.28)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- ----------

Here the compensating multiplet is described by a transverse linear
superfield @xmath (and its conjugate @xmath ) constrained by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.5.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The dynamical superfields are defined modulo gauge transformations of
the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.5.30a)
     @xmath   @xmath               (2.5.30b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

The gauge-invariant action is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.5.31)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

As demonstrated in [ 65 ] , the two actions ( 2.5.27 ) and ( 2.5.31 )
are classically equivalent, for they are related by a superfield
Legendre transformation.

## Chapter 3 Non-conformal higher-spin supercurrents in Minkowski space

In the previous chapter, the off-shell structure of the massless
superspin- @xmath @xmath multiplets was described. In the case of
half-integer superspin @xmath , with @xmath both models involve one and
the same gauge superfield @xmath , but differ in the compensating
multiplets used, i.e. transverse or longitudinal superfield. The real
unconstrained prepotential @xmath is the higher-spin superconformal
gauge multiplet introduced in [ 69 ] . In the @xmath case, the gauge
transformation ( 2.5.8a ) corresponds to linearised conformal
supergravity [ 81 ] . It is important to note that the
non-supersymmetric higher-spin theories proposed by (Fang-)Fronsdal [ 31
, 33 ] and their supersymmetric counterparts of half-integer superspin
share one common feature. Specifically, for each of them, the
gauge-invariant action is formulated in terms of a (super)conformal
gauge (super)field coupled to certain compensators. Such a description
was not known for the massless multiplet of integer superspin until
recently [ 2 ] , in which a reformulation of the integer superspin
action ( 2.5.27 ) was given. We now make these points more precise.

### 3.1 Conformal gauge (super)fields and compensators

Given an integer @xmath , the conformal spin- @xmath field [ 70 , 71 ]
is described by a real potential @xmath with the gauge freedom

  for an arbitrary real gauge parameter @xmath . In addition to the gauge field @xmath , the massless spin- @xmath action [ 31 ] also involves a real compensator @xmath with the gauge transformation                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.1.1b)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

In the fermionic case, the conformal spin- @xmath field [ 70 , 71 ] is
described by a potential @xmath and its conjugate @xmath with the gauge
freedom

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.1.2a)
  for an arbitrary gauge parameter @xmath . In addition to the gauge fields @xmath and @xmath , the massless spin- @xmath action [ 33 ] also involves two compensators @xmath and @xmath and their conjugates, with the following gauge transformations                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.1.2b)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.1.2c)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

In the case of an integer superspin @xmath , with @xmath the
superconformal multiplet introduced in [ 68 ] is described in terms of
an unconstrained prepotential @xmath and its complex conjugate with the
gauge freedom

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.1.3)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

Here the gauge parameters @xmath and @xmath are both unconstrained . As
shown in subsection 2.5.2 (see also [ 65 ] ), the prepotential @xmath
naturally appears as one of the dynamical variables in the longitudinal
formulation for the massless superspin- @xmath multiplet, in addition to
the real unconstrained prepotential @xmath . However, the gauge
transformation of @xmath given in eq. ( 2.5.26b ) differs from eq. (
3.1.3 ). The difference is that the parameter @xmath in [ 65 ] is not
unconstrained, but instead takes the form @xmath . Furthermore, the
prepotential @xmath enters the action functional ( 2.5.27 ) only via the
constrained field strength @xmath , which is longitudinal linear. It is
then natural to look for a new formulation by properly generalising the
off-shell supersymmetric action ( 2.5.27 ).

In this chapter we propose a new off-shell realisation for the massless
superspin- @xmath multiplet with the following properties: (i) the gauge
freedom of @xmath is given by ( 3.1.3 ); and (ii) the original
longitudinal formulation ( 2.5.27 ) emerges upon imposing a gauge
condition. The new model is shown to possess a dual formulation obtained
by applying a superfield Legendre transformation. We then introduce
non-conformal higher-spin supercurrents associated to the off-shell
actions for the massless @xmath supermultiplets in 4D Minkowski space.
Explicit realisations for these conserved higher-spin supercurrents are
given for models for a single massless and massive chiral superfield, as
well as the massive @xmath hypermultiplet.

### 3.2 The massless integer superspin multiplets revisited

Here we present a new off-shell gauge formulation for the massless
superspin- @xmath multiplet, as well as for the massless gravitino
multiplet ( @xmath ) which requires special consideration.

#### 3.2.1 Reformulation of the longitudinal theory

Given a positive integer @xmath , we propose to describe the massless
superspin- @xmath multiplet in terms of the following superfield
variables: (i) an unconstrained prepotential @xmath and its complex
conjugate @xmath ; (ii) a real superfield @xmath ; and (iii) a complex
superfield @xmath and its conjugate @xmath , where @xmath is constrained
to be transverse linear,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In the @xmath case, for which ( 3.2.1 ) is not defined, @xmath is
constrained to be complex linear,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The constraint ( 3.2.1 ), or its counterpart ( 3.2.2 ) for @xmath , can
be solved in terms of a complex unconstrained prepotential @xmath by the
rule

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This prepotential is defined modulo gauge transformations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with the gauge parameter @xmath being unconstrained complex.

The gauge freedom of @xmath is chosen to coincide with that of the
superconformal superspin- @xmath multiplet [ 68 ] , which is

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                 @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.2.5a)
  with unconstrained complex gauge parameters @xmath and @xmath . The @xmath -transformation is defined to act on the superfields @xmath and @xmath as follows                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                 @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.2.5b)
                                                                                                                                                                 @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.2.5c)
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The longitudinal linear superfield

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is invariant under the @xmath -transformation ( 3.2.5a ) and varies
under the @xmath -transformation as

  -- -------- -------- -- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath         (3.2.7)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- ---------

It may be checked that the following action

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.2.8)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

is invariant under the gauge transformations ( 3.2.5 ). By construction,
the action is also invariant under ( 3.2.4 ). It should be pointed out
that in constructing the new action ( 3.2.8 ), one has to check
explicitly its invariance under the @xmath -gauge transformation (
3.2.5a ). In contrast, the original action ( 2.5.27 ) is formulated in
terms of @xmath and the field strength @xmath . The latter is manifestly
invariant under the @xmath -transformation.

It is important to keep in mind the following identity, which is used
quite often in proving the gauge-invariance (and also for other
higher-spin calculations in this thesis)

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.2.9)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

The reader is referred to appendix A for the symmetrisation convention
used in this work.

The @xmath -gauge freedom ( 3.2.5 ) may be used to impose the condition

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In this gauge, the action ( 3.2.8 ) reduces to that describing the
longitudinal formulation for the massless superspin- @xmath multiplet (
2.5.27 ). The gauge condition ( 3.2.10 ) does not fix completely the
@xmath -gauge freedom. There remains a residual gauge transformation
generated by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with the parameter @xmath being an unconstrained superfield. With this
expression for @xmath , the gauge transformations ( 3.2.5a ) and (
3.2.5b ) coincide with those given in ( 2.5.26 ). Our consideration
implies that the action ( 3.2.8 ) indeed provides an off-shell
formulation for the massless superspin- @xmath multiplet.

Instead of choosing the condition ( 3.2.11 ), one can impose an
alternative gauge fixing

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In accordance with ( 3.2.5b ), in this gauge the residual gauge freedom
is described by

  -- -- -- ----------
           (3.2.13)
  -- -- -- ----------

The action ( 3.2.8 ) includes a single term which involves the ‘naked’
gauge field @xmath and not the field strength @xmath . This is actually
a BF term, for it can be written in two different forms

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.2.14)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The former makes the @xmath -gauge symmetry ( 3.2.4 ) manifestly
realised, while the latter turns the @xmath -transformation ( 3.2.5a )
into a manifest symmetry. Making use of ( 3.2.14 ) allows us to write
the action ( 3.2.8 ) in the following form:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.2.15)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

#### 3.2.2 Dual formulation

The theory with action ( 3.2.15 ) possesses a dual formulation that can
be obtained by applying the duality transformation described in
subsection 2.5.1.2 . We now associate with our theory ( 3.2.15 ) the
following first-order action

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.2.16)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

where @xmath is obtained from the action ( 3.2.15 ) by replacing @xmath
with an unconstrained complex superfield @xmath . The Lagrange
multiplier @xmath is a transverse linear superfield,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The specific normalisation of the Lagrange multiplier in ( 3.2.16 ) is
chosen to match that of [ 63 , 65 ] .

The first-order model introduced is equivalent to the original theory (
3.2.15 ), which can be seen by varying @xmath with respect to the
Lagrange multiplier. The action ( 3.2.16 ) is invariant under the gauge
@xmath -transformation ( 3.2.4 ) which acts on @xmath and @xmath by the
rule

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.2.18a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.2.18b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

The first-order action ( 3.2.16 ) is also invariant under the gauge
@xmath -transformation ( 3.2.5b ) and ( 3.2.5c ), which acts on @xmath
and @xmath as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath               (3.2.19a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.2.19b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

On the other hand, eliminating the auxiliary superfields @xmath and
@xmath from ( 3.2.16 ) using their equations of motion leads to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.2.20)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

where we have defined

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In accordance with ( 3.2.5c ), the @xmath -gauge freedom may be used to
impose the condition

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In this gauge the action ( 3.2.20 ) reduces to the one defining the
transverse formulation for the massless superspin- @xmath multiplet,
eq. ( 2.5.31 ). The gauge condition ( 3.2.22 ) is preserved by residual
local @xmath - and @xmath -transformations of the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Making use of the parametrisation ( 3.2.11 ), the residual gauge freedom
is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.2.24a)
     @xmath   @xmath               (3.2.24b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

which is exactly the gauge symmetry of the transverse formulation for
the massless superspin- @xmath multiplet, eq. ( 2.5.30 ).

We note that the action ( 3.2.8 ) involves the transverse linear
compensator @xmath and its conjugate @xmath . These superfields cannot
be dualised into a longitudinal linear supermultiplet without destroying
the locality of the theory, for the action ( 3.2.8 ) contains terms with
derivatives of @xmath and @xmath .

#### 3.2.3 Massless gravitino multiplet

The original longitudinal and transverse actions for the massless
superspin- @xmath multiplet, given by ( 2.5.27 ) and ( 2.5.31 )
respectively, are well defined for @xmath , in which case they describe
two off-shell formulations for the massless gravitino multiplet.
However, the new action functional ( 3.2.8 ) is not defined in the
@xmath case. The point is that the gauge transformation law ( 3.2.5a )
is not defined for @xmath . Instead, one should replace the gauge
transformation ( 3.2.5a ) with

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          @xmath                        (3.2.25a)
  in accordance with the superconformal gravitino model [ 68 ] . This transformation law of @xmath coincides with the one occurring in the off-shell model for the massless gravitino multiplet proposed in [ 137 ] . In addition to the gauge superfield @xmath , this model also involves two compensators: a real scalar @xmath and a chiral scalar @xmath , @xmath , with the gauge transformations                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.2.25b)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.2.25c)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

The gauge-invariant action of [ 137 ] takes the form (see also [ 35 ]
for a review):

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath denotes the longitudinal action for the gravitino
multiplet, which is obtained from ( 3.2.8 ) by choosing the gauge (
3.2.10 ) and setting @xmath . At the component level, this model
corresponds to the Fradkin-Vasiliev-de Wit-van Holten formulation for
the gravitino multiplet [ 138 , 139 ] .

There exists a dual formulation for ( 3.2.26 ). This is obtained by
performing a superfield Legendre transformation [ 140 ] , which gives
the dual action [ 140 ]

  -- -- -- ----------
           (3.2.27)
  -- -- -- ----------

where @xmath is a real linear superfield, @xmath . The gauge freedom in
this theory is given by eqs. ( 3.2.25a ), ( 3.2.25b ) and

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.28)
  -- -------- -- ----------

It may be used to impose two conditions @xmath and @xmath . We then end
up with the Ogievetsky-Sokatchev formulation for the gravitino multiplet
[ 141 ] (see section 6.9.5 of the book [ 35 ] for the technical
details).

There exists one more dual formulation for ( 3.2.26 ) that is obtained
by performing the complex linear-chiral duality transformation. It leads
to

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is a complex linear superfield constrained by @xmath . The
gauge freedom in this theory is given by eqs. ( 3.2.25a ), ( 3.2.25b )
and

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.30)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This gauge freedom does not allow one to gauge away @xmath off the mass
shell. To the best of our knowledge, the supersymmetric gauge theory (
3.2.29 ) is a new off-shell realisation for the massless gravitino
multiplet.

Let us also remark that all the constructions considered in this section
can naturally be lifted to the case of anti-de Sitter supersymmetry to
extend the results of [ 63 ] . This will be studied in chapter 4 .

### 3.3 Higher-spin multiplets of conserved currents

This section is devoted to the study of non-conformal higher-spin
supercurrent multiplets in Minkowski space, as an extension of the
superconformal case which was first described in [ 69 ] and further
elaborated in [ 68 ] . Our approach will be a higher-spin extension of
that used in subsection 2.2 to derive consistent supercurrents
associated with a linearised off-shell formulation for @xmath Poincaré
supergravity. Here we will demonstrate that the off-shell actions for
the massless half-integer superspin multiplet described in section 2.5 ,
along with the new integer superspin action ( 3.2.15 ), allow us to
formulate @xmath non-conformal higher-spin supercurrents in 4D Minkowski
space [ 1 , 2 ] .

#### 3.3.1 Non-conformal supercurrents: Half-integer superspin

Let us proceed with the massless half-integer superspin case and derive
the current multiplet corresponding to the longitudinal formulation (
2.5.19 ). The first step is to add a source (or coupling) term to the
action @xmath , eq. ( 2.5.19 )

  -- -------- -------- -- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath               (3.3.1)
                          @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -- -------- ---------

Next, requiring the above to be invariant under the @xmath
-transformation ( 2.5.16 )

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

implies that @xmath is a transverse linear superfield,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The action ( 3.3.1 ) should also respect the @xmath -gauge freedom given
in ( 2.5.17a ) and ( 2.5.18 ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

This demands the sources to satisfy the following conservation equation

  ------------------------------------------------------- -------- -- ----------
                                                                      
                                                          @xmath      (3.3.3a)
  For completeness, we also give the conjugate equation               
                                                                      
                                                          @xmath      (3.3.3b)
  ------------------------------------------------------- -------- -- ----------

Associated with the transverse model ( 2.5.10 ) is the following
non-conformal supercurrent multiplet

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.3.4a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.3.4b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

Thus the trace multiplet @xmath is longitudinal linear.

When working with higher-spin supercurrents, it proves to be convenient
to make use of a condensed notation. Let us introduce auxiliary
commuting complex variables @xmath and their conjugates @xmath . Given a
tensor superfield @xmath , we associate with it the following index-free
field on @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath in @xmath and @xmath
. Furthermore, we make use of the bosonic variables @xmath and their
corresponding partial derivatives @xmath to convert the spinor and
vector covariant derivatives into index-free operators. We introduce
operators that increase the degree of homogeneity in @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and their descendants

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The fermionic operators @xmath and @xmath are nilpotent , @xmath and
@xmath . Additionally, we also have the following nilpotent operators
which decrease the degree of homogeneity in @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.3.8a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.3.8b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

Making use of the above notation, the transverse linearity condition (
3.3.2 ) and its conjugate become

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.3.9a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.3.9b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The conservation equations ( 3.3.3a ) and ( 3.3.3b ) turn into

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.3.10a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.3.10b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

Since the operator @xmath is nilpotent, the conservation equation (
3.3.10a ) is consistent provided

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This is indeed true, as a consequence of ( 3.3.9a ).

##### 3.3.1.1 Examples of higher-spin supercurrents

Consider a free massless chiral scalar superfield @xmath with the action

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The conserved higher-spin supercurrent multiplet associated to the model
( 3.3.12 ) was first constructed in [ 68 ] . It is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.3.13)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

Using our notation, it reads

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.3.14)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

which obeys the conservation equations on-shell

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

It is useful to understand the construction of the conformal higher-spin
supercurrent ( 3.3.14 ). For this we need to discuss a few important
notions of @xmath superconformal multiplet following the presentation of
[ 68 ] .

A tensor superfield @xmath (with suppressed indices) is called
superconformal primary of weight @xmath if it transforms as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.16)

for some parameters @xmath and @xmath . Here @xmath is the @xmath
conformal Killing real supervector field generating superconformal
transformations in Minkowski space. The superfields @xmath and @xmath
denote some local Lorentz and super-Weyl parameters, respectively. The
dimension of @xmath is @xmath and its @xmath -symmetry charge is
proportional to @xmath . If @xmath is chiral, @xmath , and we say that
@xmath is superconformal primary of dimension @xmath .

For example, by requiring that both @xmath and the gauge parameter
@xmath in ( 2.5.17a ) to be superconformal primary, the superconformal
transformation law for @xmath can be derived [ 68 ] . It is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Given a real scalar @xmath , the action functional over the full
superspace,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

is invariant under the superconformal transformations if @xmath is
superconformal primary of weight @xmath . On the other hand, the chiral
action

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

is superconformally invariant provided @xmath is superconformal primary
of dimension +3. For instance, the massless model ( 3.3.12 ) is
superconformal provided the chiral scalar superfield is superconformal
primary of dimension +1.

Now, in order to describe the structure of @xmath , the authors of [ 68
] first consider coupling of the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and require invariance under the superconformal transformations ( 3.3.17
). From ( 3.3.17 ), one sees that @xmath is superconformal primary of
weight @xmath , thus the real superfield @xmath must be of weight @xmath
. Next, the requirement of gauge-invariance under ( 2.5.17a ) leads to
the conservation equations ( 3.3.15 ). Since @xmath is superconformal
primary of dimension +1, the following ansatz for @xmath as composites
of @xmath and @xmath was considered [ 68 ] :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.3.21)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The coefficients @xmath and @xmath can be fixed uniquely by imposing two
conditions: (i) @xmath must be real; and (ii) it must obey the
conservation equation ( 3.3.15 ). Indeed, setting @xmath leads to the
Ferrara-Zumino supercurrent [ 57 ] which we reviewed in subsection 2.2 :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Our aim is to construct non-conformal higher-spin supercurrent arising
in the model for a massive chiral superfield

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As will be demonstrated below, it is the longitudinal higher-spin
supercurrent multiplet described by ( 3.3.9 ) and ( 3.3.10 ), which
naturally arises in ( 3.3.23 ). Guided by the structure of the
Ferrara-Zumino supercurrent for the model ( 3.3.23 ), we assume that
@xmath has the same functional form as in the massless case, eq. (
3.3.14 ). We first compute the left-hand side of ( 3.3.10a ) and use the
massive equation of motion, @xmath . This gives

  ----------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------
                                                              
                          @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.3.24a)
  where we have denoted                                       
                                                              
                          @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.3.24b)
                                                     @xmath   
  ----------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------

Let us now determine the trace multiplet @xmath . For this we consider a
general ansatz in the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This ansatz is chosen based on the following requirements: (i) @xmath
must be transverse linear ( 3.3.9a ); and (ii) it solves the equation (
3.3.10a ),

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

For @xmath , the first condition implies that the coefficients @xmath
must satisfy

  --------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                                                     
                                                @xmath               (3.3.27a)
  Imposing condition (ii) leads to                                   
                                                                     
                                                @xmath   @xmath      
                                                         @xmath      (3.3.27b)
  In addition, it also follows from (ii) that                        
                                                                     
                                                @xmath   @xmath      (3.3.27c)
                                                @xmath   @xmath      (3.3.27d)
  --------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -- -----------

We find that the set of equations ( 3.3.27 ) leads to a unique
expression for @xmath ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

If the parameter @xmath is odd, @xmath , with @xmath , one can check
that the equations ( 3.3.27a )–( 3.3.27c ) are identically satisfied.
However, if the parameter @xmath is even, @xmath , with @xmath , there
appears an inconsistency: the right-hand side of ( 3.3.27c ) is
positive, while the left-hand side is negative, @xmath . As a result,
our solution ( 3.3.1.1 ) is only consistent for @xmath .

Relations ( 3.3.14 ), ( 3.3.25 ) and ( 3.3.1.1 ) determine the
non-conformal higher-spin supercurrent in the massive chiral model (
3.3.23 ), with the trace multiplet @xmath being the higher-spin
extension of ( 2.2.20 ). Unlike the conformal higher-spin supercurrent (
3.3.14 ), the non-conformal one exists only for the odd values of @xmath
, @xmath , with @xmath . The same conclusion was also reached by the
authors of [ 115 ] who employed the superfield Noether procedure.

#### 3.3.2 Non-conformal supercurrents: Integer superspin

Having derived a new off-shell gauge formulation for the massless
superspin- @xmath multiplet, we turn to describing the structure of the
non-conformal higher-spin supercurrents associated to the model ( 3.2.15
).

As in the half-integer superspin case, let us couple the prepotentials
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath to external sources

  -- -------- -------- -- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath               (3.3.29)
                          @xmath   
                          @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -- -------- ----------

In order for the source term @xmath to be invariant under the @xmath
-transformation in ( 3.2.5a ), the source @xmath must obey

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.30)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Next, in order for @xmath to be invariant under the transformation (
3.2.4 ), we require the superfield @xmath to satisfy

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.31)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We see that the superfields @xmath and @xmath are transverse linear and
longitudinal linear, respectively. Finally, requiring @xmath to be
invariant under the @xmath -transformation ( 3.2.5 ) gives the following
conservation equation

  ------------------- -------- -- -----------
                                  
                      @xmath      (3.3.32a)
  and its conjugate               
                                  
                      @xmath      (3.3.32b)
  ------------------- -------- -- -----------

As a consequence of ( 3.3.31 ), from ( 3.3.32a ) we deduce

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.33)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The equations ( 3.3.30 ) and ( 3.3.33 ) describe the conserved current
supermultiplet which corresponds to our theory in the gauge ( 3.2.10 ).

Taking the sum of ( 3.3.32a ) and ( 3.3.32b ) leads to

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.34)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The equations ( 3.3.30 ), ( 3.3.31 ) and ( 3.3.34 ) describe the
conserved current supermultiplet which corresponds to our theory in the
gauge ( 3.2.12 ). As a consequence of ( 3.3.31 ), the conservation
equation ( 3.3.34 ) implies

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.35)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Using our condensed notation, the transverse linear condition ( 3.3.30 )
turns into

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.3.36)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

while the longitudinal linear condition ( 3.3.31 ) takes the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.3.37)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The conservation equation ( 3.3.32a ) becomes

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.38)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and ( 3.3.35 ) takes the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.39)
  -- -------- -- ----------

##### 3.3.2.1 Examples of higher-spin supercurrents

Let us consider the Fayet-Sohnius model [ 142 , 143 ] for a free massive
hypermultiplet

  -- -- -- ----------
           (3.3.40)
  -- -- -- ----------

where the superfields @xmath are chiral, @xmath , and the mass parameter
@xmath is chosen to be positive.

In the massless case, @xmath , the fermionic higher-spin supercurrent
@xmath was first constructed in [ 68 ] . In our notation it reads

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.3.41)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

One may check that @xmath obeys, for @xmath , the conservation equations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.42)
  -- -------- -- ----------

are satisfied as a consequence of the massless equations of motion,
@xmath .

Let us construct conserved fermionic supercurrent corresponding to the
massive model ( 3.3.40 ). Assuming that @xmath has the same functional
form as in the massless case, eq. ( 3.3.41 ), and making use of the
equations of motion

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.43)
  -- -------- -- ----------

we obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.3.44)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

It can be shown that the massive supercurrent @xmath also obeys ( 3.3.36
).

As the next step, we need to construct a superfield @xmath , which has
the following properties: (i) it is longitudinal linear ( 3.3.37 ); and
(ii) it satisfies ( 3.3.39 ), which is a consequence of the conservation
equation ( 3.3.38 ). Within these conditions, our ansatz takes the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.3.45)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

Imposing the first condition, we find that the coefficients must be
related by

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------
                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                              @xmath                              (3.3.46a)
  On the other hand, for @xmath , condition (ii) yields the following recurrence relations:                                       
                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.3.46b)
                                                                                                                         @xmath   
                                                                                              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.3.46c)
                                                                                                                         @xmath   
  Condition (ii) also implies that                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.3.46d)
                                                                                              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.3.46e)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------

The above relations lead to simple expressions for @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.3.47a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.3.47b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

where @xmath . Now that we have already derived an expression for the
trace multiplet @xmath , the superfield @xmath can be computed using the
conservation equation ( 3.3.38 ). This leads to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.3.48)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

One may verify that @xmath is a real superfield.

### 3.4 Discussion

A novel off-shell formulation for the massless superspin- @xmath
multiplet has been proposed in this chapter. In addition, we derived
consistent higher-spin supercurrents associated with the off-shell gauge
theories of massless @xmath supermultiplets in Minkowski space. Several
supercurrents were constructed explicitly, paying particular attention
to models of free chiral scalar superfields.

Actually, the theory of a free massive chiral superfield ( 3.3.23 )
proves to possess conserved fermionic higher-spin supercurrents only for
even integer superspin @xmath . Indeed, one can extract from eq. (
3.3.41 ) (by setting @xmath ) the following supercurrent @xmath , which
is a complex fermionic superfield:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.4.1)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

The above expression can be further simplified by changing the index of
summation of the second term ( i.e. let @xmath ). We obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.4.2)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

This implies that @xmath if @xmath is odd. Thus, for even values of
@xmath , we have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.4.3)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

The corresponding trace multiplet @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.4.4)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

with the coefficients @xmath and @xmath given by ( 3.3.47 ). It may be
checked that the conservation equations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (3.4.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

are satisfied for the even values of @xmath , @xmath , with @xmath . An
alternative approach based on the superfield Noether procedure [ 73 ]
was recently developed in [ 115 , 116 , 117 , 118 , 119 , 120 ] to study
supercurrents and cubic vertices between various matter and massless
higher-spin multiplets in 4D Minkowski superspace.

An interesting open question is to classify all non-conformal
deformations of the higher-spin supercurrents ( 3.3.42 ), along the
lines of the recent analysis of non-conformal @xmath supercurrents in
six dimensions [ 144 ] . Our results provide the setup required for
developing a program to derive higher-spin supersymmetric models from
quantum correlation functions, as an extension of the non-supersymmetric
approaches pursued, e.g., in [ 145 , 146 , 147 ] . Another interesting
project would be to study @xmath supercurrents corresponding to the
off-shell massless higher-spin @xmath supermultiplets in 4D Minkowski
space constructed in [ 67 ] .

## Chapter 4 Higher-spin supercurrents in AdS space

An interesting feature of our results in the previous chapter is the
existence of a selection rule for higher-spin supercurrents in @xmath
supersymmetric theories. We recall that in the case of a massless
half-integer superspin multiplet, the bosonic supercurrent @xmath for a
massless chiral superfield is defined for all values of @xmath , while
those corresponding to the massive chiral model exists only for odd
@xmath . The situation turns out to be different for the integer
superspin case. For a single (massless or massive) chiral superfield,
the fermionic supercurrent @xmath exists only for even values of @xmath
, yet it is defined for arbitrary @xmath in the massive hypermultiplet
model. It is thus natural to look for a generalisation of these flat
space results to various supersymmetric theories in 4D @xmath AdS
superspace @xmath , for instance a model of @xmath massive chiral scalar
superfields with an arbitrary mass matrix. A large part of this chapter
will be devoted to this analysis.

This chapter is organised as follows. In section 4.1 we review the
general properties of transverse and longitudinal linear superfields.
Novel off-shell gauge formulations for the massless integer superspin
multiplet in AdS are presented in section 4.2 . They are shown to reduce
to those proposed in [ 63 ] upon partially fixing the gauge freedom. We
also describe off-shell formulations (including a novel one) for the
massless gravitino multiplet in AdS. In section 4.3 we introduce
higher-spin supercurrent multiplets in AdS and describe improvement
transformations for them. Sections 4.4 and 4.5 are devoted to the
explicit constructions of higher-spin supercurrents for @xmath chiral
superfields. Several nontrivial applications of the results obtained are
given in section 4.6 .

### 4.1 Linear superfields

Before we describe superfield formulations for off-shell massless
higher-spin gauge multiplets in @xmath [ 63 ] , it is important to first
recall the notion of transverse and longitudinal superfields [ 93 ] .
Complex tensor superfields @xmath and @xmath are called transverse
linear and longitudinal linear respectively, if the constraints ¹ ¹ 1
Our 4D AdS notation and two-component spinor conventions correspond to [
35 ] . For concise results concerning field theories in @xmath , see
subsection 2.3 .

are satisfied. For @xmath the latter constraint coincides with the
condition of covariant chirality, @xmath . The relations ( 4.1.1 ) lead
to the linearity conditions

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.1.2a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.1.2b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The transverse condition ( 4.1.1a ) is not defined for @xmath . However,
its corollary ( 4.1.2a ) remains consistent for the choice @xmath and
corresponds to complex linear superfields @xmath constrained by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In the family of constrained superfields @xmath introduced, the scalar
multiplet, @xmath , is used most often in applications. One can define
projectors @xmath and @xmath on the spaces of transverse linear and
longitudinal linear superfields respectively:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.1.4a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.1.4b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

with the properties

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Given a complex tensor superfield @xmath with @xmath , it can be
represented as a sum of transverse linear and longitudinal linear
multiplets,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.1.6)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

Choosing @xmath to be transverse linear ( @xmath ) or longitudinal
linear ( @xmath ), the above relation gives

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.1.7a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.1.7b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

for some prepotentials @xmath and @xmath . The constraints ( 4.1.1 )
hold for unconstrained @xmath and @xmath . These prepotentials are
defined modulo gauge transformations of the form:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.1.8a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.1.8b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

with the gauge parameters @xmath and @xmath being unconstrained.

### 4.2 Massless integer superspin multiplets

Let @xmath be a positive integer. The longitudinal formulation for the
massless superspin- @xmath multiplet in AdS was realised in [ 63 ] in
terms of the following dynamical variables

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.1)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

Here @xmath is an unconstrained real superfield, while @xmath is a
longitudinal linear superfield. The latter is the field strength
associated with a complex unconstrained prepotential @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The gauge freedom postulated in [ 63 ] is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.3a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.3b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

where the gauge parameter is @xmath is unconstrained.

The goal of this section is to reformulate the longitudinal theory by
enlarging the gauge freedom ( 4.2.3 ) at the cost of introducing a new
compensating superfield, in addition to @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . In
such a setting, the gauge freedom of @xmath coincides with that of a
superconformal multiplet of superspin- @xmath [ 68 ] . This new
formulation will be an extension of the one given in [ 2 ] (and
described in section 3.2 ) in flat superspace case.

#### 4.2.1 New formulation

We fix an integer @xmath . Our task is to derive an AdS extension of the
gauge-invariant action ( 3.2.8 ) in Minkowski superspace. The geometry
of @xmath is completely determined by the covariant derivatives algebra
( 2.3.5 ). To start with, we consider the following action functional,
which is a minimal lift of ( 3.2.8 ) to @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.2.4)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

In accordance with section 3.2 , our dynamical superfields consist of a
complex unconstrained prepotential @xmath , a real superfield @xmath and
a complex superfield @xmath constrained to be transverse linear,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In the @xmath case, for which ( 4.2.5 ) is not defined, @xmath is
instead constrained by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The constraint ( 4.2.5 ), or its counterpart ( 4.2.6 ) for @xmath , can
be solved in terms of a complex unconstrained prepotential @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which is defined modulo gauge shifts

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Here the gauge parameter @xmath is unconstrained.

The gauge-invariant action in AdS is expected to differ from ( 4.2.4 )
by some @xmath -dependent terms. These are required to ensure invariance
under the linearised gauge transformations which we postulate to be of
the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.9a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.9b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.9c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

with unconstrained gauge parameters @xmath and @xmath . We note that the
gauge freedom of @xmath is chosen to coincide with that of the
superconformal superspin- @xmath multiplet [ 68 ] . The longitudinal
linear superfield @xmath defined by ( 4.2.2 ) is invariant under the
@xmath -transformation ( 4.2.9a ) and varies under the @xmath
-transformation as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.10)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

Let us compute the variation of ( 4.2.4 ) under ( 4.2.9 ) and
iteratively add certain @xmath -dependent terms to achieve a
gauge-invariant action. The following identities are derived from the
covariant derivatives algebra ( 2.3.5 ) and prove to be useful in
carrying out such calculations:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.11a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.11b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.11c)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.11d)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.11e)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

where @xmath and @xmath .

This procedure leads to the following action in AdS, which is invariant
under ( 4.2.9 ) and, by construction, ( 4.2.8 ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.2.12)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

The above action is real due to the identity

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.2.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In the limit of vanishing curvature of the AdS superspace ( @xmath ), we
see that ( 4.2.12 ) reduces to ( 3.2.8 ).

The @xmath -gauge freedom ( 4.2.9 ) allows us to gauge away @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.2.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In this gauge, the action ( 4.2.12 ) reduces to that describing the
longitudinal formulation for the massless superspin- @xmath multiplet [
63 ] . The gauge condition ( 4.2.14 ) does not fix completely the @xmath
-gauge freedom. The residual gauge transformations are generated by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.2.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with @xmath being an unconstrained superfield. With this expression for
@xmath , the gauge transformations ( 4.2.9a ) and ( 4.2.9b ) coincide
with ( 4.2.3 ). Thus, the action ( 4.2.12 ) indeed provides an off-shell
formulation for the massless superspin- @xmath multiplet in @xmath .

Alternatively, one can impose a gauge fixing

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.2.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In accordance with ( 4.2.9b ), in this gauge the residual gauge freedom
is

  -- -- -- ----------
           (4.2.17)
  -- -- -- ----------

The gauge-invariant action ( 4.2.12 ) includes a single term which
involves the prepotential @xmath and not the field strength @xmath , the
latter being defined by ( 4.2.2 ) and invariant under the @xmath
-transformation ( 4.2.9a ). This is actually a BF term, for it can be
written in two different forms

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.18)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The former makes the gauge symmetry ( 4.2.8 ) manifestly realised, while
the latter turns the @xmath -transformation ( 4.2.9a ) into a manifest
symmetry. Making use of ( 4.2.18 ) leads to a different representation
for the action ( 4.2.12 ). It is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.2.19)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

#### 4.2.2 Dual formulation

By analogy with the flat superspace case, the action ( 4.2.19 ) can be
reformulated in terms of a transverse linear superfield by applying the
duality transformation [ 63 ] . Let us associate with our theory (
4.2.19 ) the following first-order action

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.2.20)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

where @xmath is obtained from the action ( 4.2.19 ) by replacing @xmath
with an unconstrained complex superfield @xmath . The Lagrange
multiplier @xmath is transverse linear,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.2.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We note that the specific normalisation of the Lagrange multiplier in (
4.2.20 ) is chosen to match that of [ 63 ] . Varying ( 4.2.20 ) with
respect to the Lagrange multiplier and taking into account the
constraint ( 4.2.21 ) yields @xmath . As a result, @xmath turns into the
original action ( 4.2.19 ). On the other hand, we can eliminate the
auxiliary superfields @xmath and @xmath from ( 4.2.20 ) using their
equations of motion. This leads to the dual action

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.2.22)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

where we have defined

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.2.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The first-order model introduced is equivalent to the original theory (
4.2.19 ). The action ( 4.2.20 ) is invariant under the gauge @xmath
-transformation ( 4.2.8 ) which acts on @xmath and @xmath by the rule

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.24a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.24b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

Here we point out that @xmath is invariant under the gauge
transformations ( 4.2.8 ) and ( 4.2.24b ). The first-order action (
4.2.20 ) is also invariant under the gauge @xmath -transformation (
4.2.9b ) and ( 4.2.9c ), which acts on @xmath and @xmath as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.25a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.25b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

The @xmath -gauge freedom in ( 4.2.9c ) may be used to impose the
condition

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.2.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As a result, the action ( 4.2.22 ) reduces to that describing the
transverse formulation for the massless superspin- @xmath multiplet [ 63
] . The gauge condition ( 4.2.26 ) is preserved by residual local @xmath
- and @xmath -transformations of the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.2.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Making use of the parametrisation ( 4.2.15 ), the residual gauge freedom
is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.28a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.28b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

This is exactly the gauge symmetry of the transverse formulation for the
massless superspin- @xmath multiplet [ 63 ] .

#### 4.2.3 Models for the massless gravitino multiplet in AdS

The massless gravitino multiplet ( i.e. the massless superspin-1
multiplet) was excluded from the above consideration. Here we will fill
the gap.

The (generalised) longitudinal formulation for the gravitino multiplet
is described by the action

  ---------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -- -------- -----------
                                                                                           
                                                             @xmath   @xmath               (4.2.29a)
                                                                                  @xmath   
                                                                                  @xmath   
  where @xmath is a chiral scalar superfield, @xmath , and                                 
                                                                                           
                                                             @xmath                        (4.2.29b)
  ---------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -- -------- -----------

This action is invariant under gauge transformations of the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.30a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.30b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.30c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

This is one of the two models for the massless gravitino multiplet in
AdS introduced in [ 100 ] . In a flat superspace limit, the action
reduces to that given in [ 137 ] . Imposing the gauge condition @xmath
reduces the action ( 4.2.29 ) to the original longitudinal formulation
for the massless gravitino multiplet in AdS [ 63 ] .

The action ( 4.2.29 ) involves the chiral scalar @xmath and its
conjugate only in the combination @xmath , where @xmath . This means
that the model ( 4.2.29 ) possesses a dual formulation realised in terms
of a real linear superfield @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.2.31)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The dual model is described by the action [ 100 ]

  -- -------- -------- -- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath               (4.2.32)
                          @xmath   
                          @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -- -------- ----------

This action is invariant under the gauge transformations ( 4.2.30a ), (
4.2.30b ) and

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.2.33)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In a flat superspace limit, the action ( 4.2.32 ) reduces to that given
in [ 140 ] .

In Minkowski superspace, there exists one more dual realisation for the
massless gravitino multiplet model [ 2 ] which is obtained by performing
a Legendre transformation converting @xmath into a complex linear
superfield. This formulation cannot be lifted to the AdS case, the
reason being the fact that the action ( 4.2.29 ) involves the chiral
scalar @xmath and its conjugate only in the combination @xmath , where
@xmath .

The dependence on @xmath and @xmath in the last term of ( 4.2.29 ) can
be expressed in terms of @xmath and @xmath if we introduce a complex
unconstrained prepotential @xmath for @xmath in the standard way

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.2.34)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Then making use of ( 4.2.11d ) gives

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.2.35)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Since the resulting action depends on @xmath and @xmath , we can
introduce a dual formulation for the theory that is obtained turning
@xmath and @xmath into a transverse linear superfield

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.2.36)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and its conjugate using the scheme described in [ 63 ] . The resulting
action is

  -- -------- -------- -- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath               (4.2.37)
                          @xmath   
                          @xmath   
                          @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -- -------- ----------

where we have defined

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.2.38)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The action ( 4.2.37 ) is invariant under the following gauge
transformations

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.39a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.39b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

Both @xmath and @xmath are invariant under @xmath -gauge
transformations. The action ( 4.2.37 ) is also invariant under the gauge
transformations ( 4.2.30a ), ( 4.2.30c ) and

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.40a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2.40b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

Imposing the gauge condition @xmath reduces the action ( 4.2.37 ) to the
original transverse formulation for the massless gravitino multiplet in
AdS [ 63 ] .

### 4.3 Higher-spin supercurrents

In this section we introduce higher-spin supercurrent multiplets in AdS.
First, we recall the structure of the gauge superfields in terms of
which the massless superspin- @xmath multiplet ( @xmath ) are described
[ 63 ] .

#### 4.3.1 Massless half-integer superspin multiplets

For a massless superspin- @xmath multiplet in AdS, there exist two
dually equivalent off-shell formulations ( i.e. transverse and
longitudinal), which were first constructed in [ 63 ] . The
corresponding dynamical variables are [ 63 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath               (4.3.1a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3.1b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

Here @xmath is a real unconstrained superfield. The complex superfields
@xmath and @xmath are transverse linear and longitudinal linear,
respectively,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3.2a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3.2b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

These constraints are solved in terms of unconstrained prepotentials as
follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3.3a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3.3b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The prepotentials are defined modulo gauge transformations of the form:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3.4a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3.4b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

with the gauge parameters @xmath and @xmath being unconstrained.

The gauge transformations of the superfields @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
                                         
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.3.5a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.3.5b)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.3.5c)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

Here the gauge parameter @xmath is unconstrained. The symmetrisation in
( 4.3.5c ) is extended only to the indices @xmath . It follows from (
4.3.5b ) and ( 4.3.5c ) that the transformation laws of the
prepotentials @xmath and @xmath are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3.6a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3.6b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

#### 4.3.2 Non-conformal supercurrents: Half-integer superspin

In the framework of the longitudinal formulation ( 4.3.1b ), let us
couple the prepotentials @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , to external
sources

  -- -------- -------- -- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath               (4.3.7)
                          @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -- -------- ---------

Requiring @xmath to be invariant under ( 4.3.4b ) gives

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -- ----------
                                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                  @xmath      (4.3.8a)
  and therefore @xmath is a transverse linear superfield. Requiring @xmath to be invariant under the gauge transformations ( 4.3.5a ) and ( 4.3.6b ) gives the following conservation equation:               
                                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                  @xmath      (4.3.8b)
  For completeness, we also give the conjugate equation                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                  @xmath      (4.3.8c)
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -- ----------

Similar considerations for the transverse formulation ( 4.3.1a ) lead to
the following non-conformal supercurrent multiplet

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3.9a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3.9b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

It follows from ( 4.3.9b ) that the trace multiplet @xmath is
longitudinal linear. In the flat-superspace limit, the higher-spin
supercurrent multiplets ( 4.3.8 ) and ( 4.3.9 ) reduce to those
described in subsection 3.3.1 .

Let us recall our condensed notation used in subsection 3.3.1 .
Associated with any tensor superfield @xmath is the following index-free
field on @xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.3.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We also introduce the AdS analogues of the operators ( 3.3.6 ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3.11a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3.11b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3.11c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

The following operators decrease the degree of homogeneity in the
variables @xmath and @xmath , specifically

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3.12a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3.12b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

Making use of the above notation, the transverse linear condition (
4.3.8a ) and its conjugate become

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3.13a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3.13b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

The conservation equations ( 4.3.8b ) and ( 4.3.8c ) turn into

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3.14a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3.14b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

where

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.3.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Since @xmath , the conservation equation ( 4.3.14a ) is consistent
provided

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.3.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This is indeed true, as a consequence of the transverse linear condition
( 4.3.13a ).

#### 4.3.3 Improvement transformations

The conservation equations ( 4.3.8 ) and ( 4.3.9 ) define two consistent
higher-spin supercurrents in AdS. Similar to the two irreducible AdS
supercurrents [ 99 ] , with @xmath and @xmath degrees of freedom (see
also the review in section 2.4 ), the higher-spin supercurrents ( 4.3.8
) and ( 4.3.9 ) are equivalent in the sense that there always exists a
well-defined improvement transformation that converts ( 4.3.8 ) into (
4.3.9 ). Such an improvement transformation is constructed below.

Since the trace multiplet @xmath is transverse, eq. ( 4.3.8a ), there
exists a well-defined complex tensor operator @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.3.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Let us introduce the real @xmath and imaginary @xmath parts of @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.3.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Then it may be checked that the operators

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3.19a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3.19b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

enjoy the conservation equation ( 4.3.9 ) and the constraint ( 4.3.9b ).
It is also not difficult to construct an inverse improvement
transformation converting the higher-spin supercurrent ( 4.3.9 ) to (
4.3.8 ).

In accordance with the result obtained, for all applications it suffices
to work with the longitudinal supercurrent ( 4.3.8 ). This is why in the
integer superspin case, which will be studied in the next subsection, we
will introduce only a higher-spin supercurrent corresponding to the new
gauge formulation ( 4.2.19 ).

There exists an improvement transformation ² ² 2 One may compare this to
( 2.4.5 ) in the lower-spin case. for the supercurrent multiplet ( 4.3.8
) Given a chiral scalar superfield @xmath , we introduce

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------
                                         
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.3.20a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.3.20b)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------

The operators @xmath and @xmath prove to obey the conservation equation
( 4.3.8 ).

#### 4.3.4 Non-conformal supercurrents: Integer superspin

We now make use of the new gauge formulation ( 4.2.12 ), or equivalently
( 4.2.19 ), for the integer superspin- @xmath multiplet to derive the
AdS analogue of the non-conformal higher-spin supercurrents in
subsection 3.3.2 .

Let us couple the prepotentials @xmath , @xmath and @xmath to external
sources

  -- -------- -------- -- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath               (4.3.21)
                          @xmath   
                          @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -- -------- ----------

In order for @xmath to be invariant under the @xmath -transformation in
( 4.2.9a ), the source @xmath must satisfy

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.3.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Next, requiring @xmath to be invariant under the transformation ( 4.2.8
) leads to

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.3.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We see that the superfields @xmath and @xmath are transverse linear and
longitudinal linear, respectively. Finally, requiring @xmath to be
invariant under the @xmath -transformation ( 4.2.9 ) gives the following
conservation equation

  -------------------------- -------- -- -----------
                                         
                             @xmath      (4.3.24a)
  as well as its conjugate               
                                         
                             @xmath      (4.3.24b)
  -------------------------- -------- -- -----------

As a consequence of ( 4.3.23 ), from ( 4.3.24a ) we deduce

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.3.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The equations ( 4.3.22 ) and ( 4.3.25 ) describe the conserved current
supermultiplet which corresponds to our theory in the gauge ( 4.2.16 ).

Taking the sum of ( 4.3.24a ) and ( 4.3.24b ) leads to

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.3.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The equations ( 4.3.22 ), ( 4.3.23 ) and ( 4.3.26 ) describe the
conserved current supermultiplet which corresponds to our theory in the
gauge ( 4.2.14 ). As a consequence of ( 4.3.23 ), the conservation
equation ( 4.3.26 ) implies

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.3.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Written in the condensed notation, the transverse linear condition (
4.3.22 ) turns into

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3.28)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

while the longitudinal linear condition ( 4.3.23 ) takes the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3.29)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The conservation equation ( 4.3.24a ) becomes

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.3.30)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and ( 4.3.27 ) takes the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.3.31)
  -- -------- -- ----------

#### 4.3.5 Improvement transformation

There exist an improvement transformation for the supercurrent multiplet
( 4.3.24 ). Given a chiral scalar superfield @xmath , we introduce

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------
                                         
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.3.32a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.3.32b)
                                @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.3.32c)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------

It may be checked that the operators @xmath , @xmath and @xmath obey the
conservation equation ( 4.3.30 ), as well as ( 4.3.23 ) and ( 4.3.28 ).

### 4.4 Higher-spin supercurrents for chiral superfields: Half-integer
superspin

In the remainder of this chapter we will study explicit realisations of
the higher spin supercurrents introduced above in various supersymmetric
field theories in AdS.

#### 4.4.1 Superconformal model for a chiral superfield

Let us consider the superconformal theory of a single chiral scalar
superfield

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.4.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is covariantly chiral, @xmath . We can define the conformal
supercurrent @xmath in direct analogy with the flat superspace case [ 68
, 1 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.4.2)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

Making use of the massless equations of motion, @xmath , one may check
that @xmath satisfies the conservation equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.4.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The calculation of ( 4.4.3 ) in AdS is much more complicated than in
flat superspace due to the fact that the algebra of covariant
derivatives ( 2.3.5 ) is nontrivial. Let us sketch the main steps in
evaluating the left-hand side of eq. ( 4.4.3 ) with @xmath given by (
4.4.2 ). We start with the obvious relations

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.4.4a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.4.4b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

To simplify eq. ( 4.4.4b ), we may push @xmath , say, to the left
provided that we take into account its commutator with @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.4.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Associated with the Lorentz generators are the operators

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.4.6a)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.4.6b)
  where @xmath appears in the right-hand side of ( 4.4.5 ). These operators annihilate every superfield @xmath of the form ( 4.3.10 ), ³ ³ 3 These properties are analogous to those that play a fundamental role for the consistent definition of covariant projective supermultiplets in 5D @xmath [ 148 ] and 4D @xmath [ 149 ] supergravity theories.                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            @xmath                        (4.4.6c)
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

From the above consideration, it follows that

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.4.7a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.4.7b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

We also state some other properties which we often use throughout our
calculations

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.4.8a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.4.8b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.4.8c)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.4.8d)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.4.8e)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The above identities suffice to prove that the supercurrent ( 4.4.2 )
does obey the conservation equation ( 4.4.3 ).

#### 4.4.2 Non-superconformal model for a chiral superfield

Let us now add the mass term to ( 4.4.1 ) and consider the following
action

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.4.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath a complex mass parameter. The real supercurrent @xmath takes
the same form as in the massless case, ( 4.4.2 ). However, in the
massive case @xmath satisfies a more general conservation equation (
4.3.14a ) for some superfield @xmath , which we need to determine.
Indeed, making use of the equations of motion

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.4.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

we obtain

  ----------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------
                                                              
                          @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.4.11a)
  where we have denoted                                       
                                                              
                          @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.4.11b)
                                                     @xmath   
  ----------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------

We now look for a superfield @xmath such that (i) it obeys the
transverse linear constraint ( 4.3.13a ); and (ii) it satisfies the
equation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.4.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Our analysis will be similar to the one performed in 3.3.1.1 in flat
superspace. We consider a general ansatz

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.4.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with some coefficients @xmath which have to be determined. For @xmath ,
condition (i) implies that the coefficients @xmath must satisfy

  ----------------------------------------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                                                 
                                            @xmath               (4.4.14a)
  while (ii) gives the following equation                        
                                                                 
                                            @xmath   @xmath      
                                                     @xmath      (4.4.14b)
  Condition (ii) also implies that                               
                                                                 
                                            @xmath   @xmath      (4.4.14c)
                                            @xmath   @xmath      (4.4.14d)
  ----------------------------------------- -------- -------- -- -----------

It turns out that the equations ( 4.4.14 ) lead to a unique expression
for @xmath given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

If the parameter @xmath is odd, @xmath , with @xmath , one can check
that the equations ( 4.4.14a )–( 4.4.14c ) are identically satisfied.
However, if the parameter @xmath is even, @xmath , with @xmath , there
appears an inconsistency: the right-hand side of ( 4.4.14c ) is
positive, while the left-hand side is negative, @xmath . Therefore, our
solution ( 4.4.2 ) is only consistent for @xmath .

Relations ( 4.4.2 ), ( 4.4.13 ) and ( 4.4.2 ) determine the
non-conformal higher-spin supercurrents in the massive chiral model (
4.4.9 ). Unlike the conformal higher-spin supercurrents ( 4.4.2 ), the
non-conformal ones exist only for the odd values of @xmath , @xmath ,
with @xmath . In the flat superspace limit, the above results reduce to
those derived in 3.3.1.1 and in Ref. [ 115 ] .

#### 4.4.3 Superconformal model with @xmath chiral superfields

We now generalise the superconformal model ( 4.4.1 ) to the case of
@xmath covariantly chiral scalar superfields @xmath , @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.4.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The novel feature of the @xmath case is that there exist two different
types of conformal supercurrents, which are:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.4.17)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

and

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.4.18)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

Here @xmath and @xmath are arbitrary real symmetric and antisymmetric
constant matrices, respectively. We have put an overall factor @xmath in
eq. ( 4.4.18 ) in order to make @xmath real. One can show that the
currents ( 4.4.17 ) and ( 4.4.18 ) are conserved on-shell:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.4.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The above results can be recast in terms of the matrix conformal
supercurrent @xmath with components

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.4.20)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

which is Hermitian, @xmath . The chiral action ( 4.4.16 ) possesses
rigid @xmath symmetry acting on the chiral column-vector @xmath ) by
@xmath , with @xmath , which implies that the supercurrent ( 4.4.20 )
transforms as @xmath .

#### 4.4.4 Massive model with @xmath chiral superfields

Consider a theory of @xmath massive chiral multiplets with action

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.4.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is a constant symmetric @xmath mass matrix. The
corresponding equations of motion are

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.4.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

First we will consider the case where @xmath is a real and symmetric
matrix. Making use of the equations of motion, we obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.4.23)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

Now, suppose the product @xmath is symmetric, which implies @xmath .
Then, ( 4.4.23 ) becomes

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.4.24)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

We now look for a superfield @xmath such that (i) it obeys the
transverse antilinear constraint ( 4.3.13b ); and (ii) it satisfies the
conservation equation ( 4.3.14b ):

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.4.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As in the single field case we consider a general ansatz

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.4.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Then for @xmath , condition (i) implies that the coefficients @xmath
must satisfy

  ----------------------------------------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                                                 
                                            @xmath               (4.4.27a)
  while (ii) gives the following equation                        
                                                                 
                                            @xmath   @xmath      
                                                     @xmath      (4.4.27b)
  Condition (ii) also implies that                               
                                                                 
                                            @xmath   @xmath      (4.4.27c)
                                            @xmath   @xmath      (4.4.27d)
  ----------------------------------------- -------- -------- -- -----------

The above conditions coincide with eqs.( 4.4.14a )–( 4.4.14d ) in the
case of a single, massive chiral superfield, which are satisfied only
for @xmath . Hence, the solution for the coefficients @xmath is given
by ( 4.4.2 ) for odd values of @xmath and there is no solution for even
@xmath .

On the other hand, if @xmath is antisymmetric (which is equivalent to
@xmath ), eq. ( 4.4.24 ) is slightly modified

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.4.28)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

Starting with a general ansatz

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.4.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and imposing conditions (i) and (ii) yield the following equations for
the coefficients @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -- -----------
                          
     @xmath               (4.4.30a)
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (4.4.30b)
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.4.30c)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.4.30d)
  -- -------- -------- -- -----------

The equations ( 4.4.30 ) lead to a unique expression for @xmath given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

If the parameter @xmath is even, @xmath , with @xmath , one can check
that the equations ( 4.4.30a )–( 4.4.30d ) are identically satisfied.
However, if the parameter @xmath is odd, @xmath , with @xmath , there
appears an inconsistency: the right-hand side of ( 4.4.30c ) is
positive, while the left-hand side is negative, @xmath . Therefore, our
solution ( 4.4.4 ) is only consistent for @xmath .

Finally, we consider @xmath with the corresponding @xmath given by (
4.4.18 ). The analysis in this case is similar to the one presented
above and we will simply state the results. If @xmath is odd the
non-conformal higher-spin supercurrents exist if @xmath . The trace
supercurrent @xmath is given by ( 4.4.26 ) with the coefficients @xmath
given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

If @xmath is even the non-conformal higher-spin supercurrents exist if
@xmath . The trace supercurrent @xmath is given by ( 4.4.29 ) with the
coefficients @xmath given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Note that the coefficients @xmath in ( 5.5.6 ) differ from similar
coefficients in ( 4.4.2 ) by a factor of @xmath . This means that for
odd @xmath we can define a more general supercurrent

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.4.34)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

where @xmath is a generic matrix which can be split into the symmetric
and antisymmetric parts @xmath . Here both @xmath and @xmath are real
and we put an @xmath in front of @xmath because @xmath must be real.
From the above consideration it then follows that the corresponding more
general solution for @xmath reads

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.4.35)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are, as before, given by eq. ( 4.4.2 ).
Similarly, the coefficients @xmath in ( 4.4.4 ) differ from similar
coefficients in ( 4.4.4 ) by a factor of @xmath . This means that for
even @xmath we can define a more general supercurrent ( 4.4.34 ), where
@xmath is a generic matrix which we can split as before into the
symmetric and antisymmetric parts, @xmath . From the above consideration
it then follows that the corresponding more general solution for @xmath
reads

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.4.36)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are given by eq. ( 4.4.4 ).

### 4.5 Higher-spin supercurrents for chiral superfields: Integer
superspin

In this section we provide explicit realisations for the fermionic
higher-spin supercurrents (integer superspin) in models described by
chiral scalar superfields.

#### 4.5.1 Massive hypermultiplet model

Consider a free massive hypermultiplet in AdS

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.5.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the superfields @xmath are covariantly chiral, @xmath and @xmath
is a complex mass parameter. ⁴ ⁴ 4 This model possesses off-shell @xmath
AdS supersymmetry [ 96 , 150 ] . By a change of variables it is possible
to make @xmath real. Let us introduce another set of fields @xmath ,
@xmath , related to @xmath by the following transformations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.5.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Under the transformations ( 4.5.2 ), the action ( 4.5.1 ) turns into

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.5.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the mass parameter @xmath is now real. In the massless case,
@xmath , the conserved fermionic supercurrent @xmath was constructed in
[ 68 ] and is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.5.4)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

Making use of the massless equations of motion, @xmath , one may check
that @xmath obeys, for @xmath , the conservation equations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.5.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We will construct fermionic higher-spin supercurrents corresponding to
the massive model ( 4.5.3 ). Making use of the massive equations of
motion

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.5.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

we obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.5.7)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

It can be shown that the massive supercurrent @xmath also obeys ( 4.3.28
).

We now look for a superfield @xmath such that (i) it obeys the
longitudinal linear constraint ( 4.3.29 ); and (ii) it satisfies (
4.3.31 ), which is a consequence of the conservation equation ( 4.3.30
). For this we consider a general ansatz

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.5.8)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

Condition (i) implies that the coefficients must be related by

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
                                                                                                                    
                                                                                @xmath                              (4.5.9a)
  while for @xmath , condition (ii) gives the following recurrence relations:                                       
                                                                                                                    
                                                                                @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.5.9b)
                                                                                                           @xmath   
                                                                                @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.5.9c)
                                                                                                           @xmath   
  Condition (ii) also implies that                                                                                  
                                                                                                                    
                                                                                @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.5.9d)
                                                                                @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.5.9e)
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

The above conditions lead to simple expressions for @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.5.10a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.5.10b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

where @xmath .

#### 4.5.2 Superconformal model with @xmath chiral superfields

In this subsection we will generalise the above results for @xmath
chiral superfields @xmath , @xmath . We first consider the
superconformal model ( 4.4.16 ). Let us construct the following
fermionic supercurrent

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.5.11)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

where @xmath is a constant complex matrix. By changing the summation
index it is not hard to show that @xmath if (i) @xmath is odd and @xmath
is symmetric; and (ii) @xmath is even and @xmath is antisymmetric, that
is

  -- -------- -------- -- -- -----------
                             
     @xmath   @xmath         (4.5.12a)
     @xmath   @xmath         (4.5.12b)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- -----------

This means that we have to consider the two separate cases: the case of
even @xmath with symmetric @xmath , and the case of odd @xmath with
antisymmetric @xmath . Using the massless equation of motion, @xmath ,
one may check that @xmath satisfies the conservation equations ( 4.5.5 )

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.5.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In the case of a single chiral superfield, the supercurrent ( 4.5.11 )
exists for even @xmath ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.5.14)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The flat-superspace version of ( 4.5.14 ) is given by eq. ( 3.4.3 ) and
Ref. [ 119 ] .

#### 4.5.3 Massive model with @xmath chiral superfields

Let us turn to the massive model ( 4.4.21 ). As was discussed in
previous subsection, to construct the conserved currents we first have
to calculate @xmath using the equations of motion in the massive theory.
The calculation depends on whether @xmath is symmetric or antisymmetric.

##### 4.5.3.1 Symmetric @xmath

If @xmath is a symmetric matrix, using the massive equation of motion,
we obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.5.15)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

Here we have two cases to consider:

1.  @xmath is symmetric @xmath even.

2.  @xmath is antisymmetric @xmath even.

Case 1: Eq. ( 4.5.15 ) can be simplified to yield

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.5.16)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

We now look for a superfield @xmath such that (i) it obeys the
longitudinal linear constraint ( 4.3.29 ); and (ii) it satisfies (
4.3.31 ), which is a consequence of the conservation equation ( 4.3.30
). The precise form of eq. ( 4.3.31 ) in the present case is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (4.5.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

To find @xmath we consider a general ansatz

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.5.18)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

It is possible to show that no solution for @xmath can be found unless
we impose ⁵ ⁵ 5 Since @xmath and @xmath commute we can take them both to
be diagonal, @xmath , @xmath . Then the condition ( 4.5.19 ) means that
@xmath for some integers @xmath .

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.5.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Furthermore, condition (i) implies that the coefficients must be related
by

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------
                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                        @xmath                              (4.5.20a)
  while for @xmath , while condition (ii) and eq. ( 4.5.19 ) gives the following recurrence relations                                       
                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                        @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.5.20b)
                                                                                                                                   @xmath   
  Condition (ii) also implies that                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                        @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.5.20c)
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------

The above conditions lead to simple expressions for @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.5.21)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath and @xmath is even.
Case 2: If we take @xmath to be antisymmetric, a similar analysis shows
that no solution for @xmath exists for even values of @xmath .

##### 4.5.3.2 Antisymmetric @xmath

If @xmath is antisymmetric we get:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.5.22)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

As in the symmetric @xmath case, there are also two cases to consider:

1.  @xmath is symmetric @xmath odd.

2.  @xmath is antisymmetric @xmath odd.

Case 1: Using eq. ( 4.5.22 ) and keeping in mind that @xmath is odd, we
obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.5.23)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

Then it follows that eq. ( 4.3.31 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (4.5.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Note that it is the equation same as eq. ( 4.5.17 ) which means that the
solution for @xmath is the same as in Case 1 . That is, the matrices
@xmath and @xmath must satisfy @xmath , @xmath is given by eq. ( 4.5.18
) and the coefficients @xmath are given by eqs. ( 4.5.20 ). Case 2: If
we take @xmath to be antisymmetric, a similar analysis shows that no
solution for @xmath exists for odd values of @xmath .

##### 4.5.3.3 Massive hypermultiplet model revisited

As a consistency check of our general method, let us reconsider the case
of a hypermultiplet studied previously. For this we will take @xmath ,
the mass matrix in the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.5.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and denote @xmath . If @xmath is even we will take @xmath in the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.5.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Note that @xmath commutes with @xmath . The condition @xmath is
equivalent to @xmath . For simplicity, let us choose both @xmath and
@xmath to be real. Under these conditions eq. ( 4.5.11 ) for @xmath
becomes

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.5.27)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

Introducing a new summation variable @xmath for the second and fourth
terms, we obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.5.28)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

We see that for even @xmath it coincides with the hypermultiplet
supercurrent given by ( 4.5.4 ) up to an overall coefficient @xmath . If
@xmath is odd we have to choose @xmath to be antisymmetric

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.5.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Note that @xmath now anticommutes with @xmath . For simplicity, we again
choose @xmath and @xmath to be real. Now the expression ( 4.5.11 ) for
@xmath becomes

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.5.30)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

We see that for odd @xmath it coincides with the hypermultiplet
supercurrent given by ( 4.5.4 ) up to an overall coefficient @xmath . To
summarise, we reproduced the hypermultiplet supercurrent ( 4.5.4 ) for
both even and odd values of @xmath . However, for even @xmath it came
from a symmetric matrix ( 4.5.26 ) and for odd @xmath it came from an
antisymmetric matrix ( 4.5.29 ).

Let us now consider @xmath . First, we will note that the product @xmath
is given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.5.31)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This means that @xmath is given by the following expression valid for
all values of @xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.5.32)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the matrix @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.5.33)
  -- -------- -- ----------

It is easy to see that this expression for @xmath coincides with the one
obtained for the hypermultiplet in the previous subsections in eqs. (
4.5.8 ), ( 4.5.9a ), ( 4.5.10 ) up to an overall factor @xmath .

### 4.6 Summary and applications

In this chapter, we have described higher-spin conserved supercurrents
for @xmath supersymmetric theories in four-dimensional anti-de Sitter
space. We have explicitly constructed such supercurrents in the case of
@xmath chiral scalar superfields with an arbitrary mass matrix @xmath .
The structure of the supercurrents depends on whether the superspin is
integer or half-integer, as well as on the value of the superspin, and
the mass matrix. Let us summarise our results.

In the case of half-integer superspin- @xmath , the supercurrent has the
structure @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath is a Hermitian matrix. The
precise form of @xmath was discussed in section 4.4 . In the massless
theory it is conserved for all values of @xmath . In the massive theory,
the conservation equation involves an additional complex multiplet
@xmath whose existence depends on the value of @xmath and the mass
matrix. For odd values of @xmath , it exists provided @xmath , @xmath ,
where @xmath and @xmath are the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of
@xmath , respectively. When @xmath is even, it exists provided @xmath ,
@xmath .

In the case of integer superspin- @xmath , the fermionic supercurrent
was discussed in section 4.5 . It has the form @xmath . In the massless
theory it exists for even values of @xmath if @xmath is symmetric and
for odd values of @xmath if @xmath is antisymmetric. In the massive
theory the conservation equation involves an additional complex
multiplet @xmath and a real multiplet @xmath . Their existence also
depends on the value of @xmath . For @xmath even they exist provided
@xmath , @xmath and for @xmath odd provided @xmath , @xmath .

It should be mentioned that in the non-supersymmetric case, conserved
higher-spin currents for scalar and spinor fields in Minkowski space
have been studied extensively in the past. Appendices B.1 and B.2 review
the construction of conserved higher-spin currents for @xmath scalars
and spinors, respectively, with arbitrary mass matrices. These results
are scattered in the literature, including [ 102 , 103 , 104 , 105 ] .

In the rest of this section, we will discuss several applications of the
results obtained.

#### 4.6.1 Higher-spin supercurrents for a tensor multiplet

Let us consider a special case of the non-superconformal chiral model (
4.4.9 ) with the mass parameter @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.6.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This theory is known to be dual to a tensor multiplet model [ 151 ]

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.6.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which is realised in terms of a real linear superfield @xmath ,
constrained by @xmath , which is the gauge-invariant field strength of a
chiral spinor superfield

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.6.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We recall that the duality between ( 4.6.1 ) and ( 4.6.2 ) follows,
e.g., from the fact the off-shell constraint

  --------------------------------------- -------- -- ----------
                                                      
                                          @xmath      (4.6.4a)
  and the equation of motion for @xmath               
                                                      
                                          @xmath      (4.6.4b)
  --------------------------------------- -------- -- ----------

are equivalent to the equation of motion for @xmath

  ------------------------------ -------- -- ----------
                                             
                                 @xmath      (4.6.5a)
  and the off-shell constraint               
                                             
                                 @xmath      (4.6.5b)
  ------------------------------ -------- -- ----------

respectively.

Higher-spin supercurrents for the tensor model ( 4.6.2 ) can be obtained
from the results derived in subsection 4.4.2 in conjunction with an
improvement transformation of the type ( 4.3.20 ) with @xmath . Given an
odd @xmath , for the supercurrent we get

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.6.6)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

The corresponding trace multiplet proves to be

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.6.7)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

The coefficient @xmath is given by eq. ( 4.4.2 ), @xmath is odd. The
Ferrara-Zumino supercurrent ( @xmath ) for the model ( 4.6.2 ) in an
arbitrary supergravity background was derived in section 6.3 of [ 35 ] .
Modulo normalisation, the AdS supercurrent is

  ------------------------------------------ -------- -- ----------
                                                         
                                             @xmath      (4.6.8a)
  and the corresponding trace multiplet is               
                                                         
                                             @xmath      (4.6.8b)
  ------------------------------------------ -------- -- ----------

The supercurrent obeys the conservation equation ( 2.4.1 ).

#### 4.6.2 Higher-spin supercurrents for a complex linear multiplet

Conserved higher-spin supercurrents for a complex linear multiplet in
Minkowski superspace were first studied by Koutrolikos, Koči and von
Unge [ 116 ] , as an extension of the lower-spin case [ 152 ] . In AdS,
the superconformal non-minimal scalar multiplet is described by the
action

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.6.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a complex linear scalar, @xmath . This is a dual
formulation for the superconformal chiral model ( 4.4.1 ). As is well
known, the duality between ( 4.4.1 ) and ( 4.6.9 ) follows from the fact
that the off-shell constraint

  --------------------------------------- -------- -- -----------
                                                      
                                          @xmath      (4.6.10a)
  and the equation of motion for @xmath               
                                                      
                                          @xmath      (4.6.10b)
  --------------------------------------- -------- -- -----------

are equivalent to the equation of motion for @xmath , @xmath , and the
off-shell constraint @xmath , respectively. In other words, on the mass
shell we can identify @xmath with @xmath .

The higher-spin supercurrents, @xmath and @xmath , for the model ( 4.6.9
) are obtained from ( 4.4.2 ) and ( 4.5.14 ), respectively, by replacing
@xmath with @xmath . The fermionic supercurrent @xmath exists for even
values of @xmath . Indeed, in Minkowski superspace, the expression for
@xmath obtained coincides with the main result of Ref. [ 116 ] ⁶ ⁶ 6 See
also [ 153 ] for the discussion of the fermionic supercurrent @xmath . ,
which applied the Noether procedure to generate cubic vertices between
massless higher-spin supermultiplets and the free complex linear
superfield model

     @xmath      (4.6.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

#### 4.6.3 Gauge higher-spin multiplets and conserved supercurrents

For each of the two off-shell formulations for the massless multiplet of
half-integer superspin- @xmath , with @xmath , which we reviewed in
section 4.3.1 , it was shown in [ 63 ] that there exists a
gauge-invariant field strength @xmath which is covariantly chiral,
@xmath , and is given by the expression

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.6.12)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

It was also shown in [ 63 ] that on the mass shell it holds that (i)
@xmath and its conjugate @xmath are the only independent gauge-invariant
field strengths; and (ii) @xmath obeys the irreducibility condition

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The relations ( 4.6.12 ) and ( 4.6.13 ) also hold for the cases @xmath
and @xmath , which correspond to the vector multiplet and linearised
supergravity, respectively. In terms of @xmath and @xmath , we can
define the following higher-spin supercurrent

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which obeys the conservation equation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In the case of the longitudinal formulation for the massless multiplet
of integer superspin- @xmath , with @xmath , which we described in
section 4.2 , it was shown in [ 63 ] that there exists a gauge-invariant
field strength @xmath which is covariantly chiral, @xmath , and is given
by the expression ⁷ ⁷ 7 The flat-superspace version of ( 4.6.16 ) is
given in section 6.9 of [ 35 ] .

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.6.16)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

As demonstrated in [ 63 ] , on the mass shell it holds that (i) @xmath
and its conjugate @xmath are the only independent gauge-invariant field
strengths; and (ii) @xmath obeys the irreducibility condition

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The relations ( 4.6.16 ) and ( 4.6.17 ) also hold for the case @xmath ,
which corresponds to the gravitino multiplet. In terms of @xmath and
@xmath , we can define the higher-spin supercurrent

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which obeys the conservation equation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The conserved supercurrents @xmath , with @xmath , are the AdS
extensions of those introduced many years ago by Howe, Stelle and
Townsend [ 69 ] .

Now, for any positive integer @xmath , we can try to generalise the
higher-spin supercurrent ( 4.4.2 ) as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.6.20)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

Making use of the on-shell condition

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

one may check that

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.6.22)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

This demonstrates that @xmath is not conserved in AdS @xmath .

In the flat-superspace limit, @xmath , the right-hand side of ( 4.6.22 )
vanishes and @xmath becomes conserved. In Minkowski superspace, the
conserved supercurrent @xmath was recently constructed in [ 119 ] as an
extension of the non-supersymmetric approach [ 154 ] .

As a generalisation of the conserved supercurrents @xmath , one can
introduce

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with @xmath . They obey the conservation equations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and can be viewed as Noether currents for the generalised superconformal
higher-spin multiplets introduced in [ 68 ] . Starting from the
conserved supercurrents ( 4.6.23 ), one can construct a generalisation
of ( 4.6.20 ). We will not elaborate on a construction here.

## Chapter 5 @xmath supersymmetric higher-spin gauge theories and
current multiplets in three dimensions

In four dimensions, there exists a correspondence between @xmath anti-de
Sitter (AdS) supergravity [ 110 ] and the two dually equivalent series
of massless multiplets of half-integer superspin- @xmath , with @xmath [
63 ] . Specifically, there are two off-shell formulations for pure
@xmath AdS supergravity: minimal (see e.g. [ 56 , 35 ] for reviews) and
non-minimal [ 99 ] . These theories possess a single maximally
supersymmetric solution, which is the @xmath AdS superspace @xmath . For
the lowest superspin value corresponding to @xmath , the longitudinal
series yields the linearised action for minimal AdS supergravity, while
the transverse one leads to linearised non-minimal AdS supergravity.

In three dimensions, the AdS group is a product of two simple groups,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and so are its simplest supersymmetric extensions, @xmath . This implies
that @xmath -extended AdS supergravity exists in several incarnations [
111 ] . These are known as the @xmath AdS supergravity theories, where
the non-negative integers @xmath are such that @xmath . Superspace
approach to 3D @xmath -extended conformal supergravity was developed by
Kuzenko, Lindström and Tartaglino-Mazzucchelli [ 113 ] , and used to
construct off-shell @xmath supergravity-matter couplings. The formalism
of [ 113 ] was then applied to study the geometry of @xmath AdS
superspaces [ 155 ] . The so-called @xmath AdS superspace [ 155 ]

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

can be realised as a maximally symmetric solution of @xmath AdS
supergravity (see [ 155 ] for the technical details).

In the case of 3D @xmath supersymmetry, there exist two distinct AdS
superspaces, @xmath and @xmath . The former is the 3D counterpart of the
4D @xmath AdS superspace, while the latter has no 4D analogue. The
existence of these superspaces and their superconformal flatness were
studied for the first time in [ 112 ] . Ref. [ 83 ] presented superfield
formulations for 3D @xmath AdS supergravity theories and their
corresponding supercurrent multiplets. Two off-shell formulations for
(1,1) AdS supergravity have been developed: minimal [ 156 , 157 , 158 ,
159 , 113 , 83 , 160 ] and non-minimal [ 83 , 160 ] theories; and one
for (2,0) AdS supergravity [ 161 , 113 , 83 , 160 ] . @xmath is the
unique maximally symmetric solution of the two dually equivalent (1,1)
AdS supergravity theories, minimal and non-minimal ones. @xmath is the
unique maximally symmetric solution of the (2,0) AdS supergravity. This
supergravity theory was originally formulated in [ 161 ] in the
component setting. The early superspace descriptions of the minimal
(1,1) supergravity were given in [ 157 , 158 ] .

It has recently been pointed out [ 4 ] that the correspondence between
AdS supergravity theories and massless higher-spin supermultiplets in 3D
anti-de Sitter space, @xmath , might occur in the @xmath case. Since
there are three off-shell @xmath AdS supergravity theories, one might
expect the existence of three series of massless higher-spin gauge
supermultiplets. Two series of massless higher-spin actions associated
with the minimal and the non-minimal (1,1) AdS supergravity theories
were presented in [ 4 ] . These generalise similar constructions in the
super-Poincaré case [ 49 ] . As will be explained in sections 5.6 and
5.7 , the off-shell higher-spin supermultiplets in (2,0) AdS superspace
[ 5 ] were constructed using a different approach.

Pure @xmath supergravity (massless superspin-3/2 multiplet) and its
higher-spin extensions have no propagating degrees of freedom in three
dimensions. Nevertheless, there are at least two nontrivial applications
of the massless higher-spin gauge supermultiplets. Firstly, one can
follow the pattern of topologically massive (super)gravity [ 162 , 163 ,
164 , 165 ] and construct massive higher-spin supermultiplets by
combining a massless action with a higher-spin extension of the action
for linearised conformal supergravity. This has been achieved in [ 49 ]
in the @xmath super-Poincaré case, and similar ideas have been
implemented in the frameworks of @xmath Poincaré and AdS supersymmetry [
50 , 51 ] . Topologically massive higher-spin supermultiplets in (1,1)
and (2,0) AdS superspaces have been formulated in [ 4 ] and [ 5 ] ,
respectively. The second application is to develop a 3D extension of the
higher-spin supercurrents presented in chapters 3 and 4 . Specifically,
making use of the off-shell formulations for massless higher-spin
supermultiplets in @xmath , one can define consistent higher-spin
supercurrent multiplets that contain ordinary bosonic and fermionic
conserved currents in @xmath . One can then look for explicit
realisations of such higher-spin supercurrents in concrete
supersymmetric theories in @xmath [ 4 ] .

This chapter can be divided into two parts: sections 5.1 to 5.5 focus on
rigid supersymmetric higher-spin gauge theories in (1,1) AdS superspace
which were studied in [ 4 ] , while sections 5.6 and 5.7 are concerned
with the construction of off-shell massless higher-spin gauge multiplets
with (2,0) AdS supersymmetry as described in [ 5 ] . In section 5.1 , we
review the superspace geometry of 3D @xmath conformal supergravity. We
then introduce primary linear supermultiplets and conformal higher-spin
gauge superfields coupled to @xmath conformal supergravity, the latter
being one of the key ingredients in constructing massless
higher-superspin actions. Section 5.2 reviews the two inequivalent
@xmath AdS superspaces. Two dual off-shell Lagrangian formulations for
every massless higher-spin supermultiplet in (1,1) AdS superspace will
be presented in sections 5.3 and 5.4 . As in the 4D AdS constructions,
the two cases of half-integer and integer superspin, as well as massless
gravitino multiplet have to be treated separately. Section 5.5 is
devoted to constructing non-conformal higher-spin supercurrent
multiplets in models for chiral scalar superfields. The materials
presented in sections 5.1 , 5.3 and subsections 5.4.1 @xmath 5.4.2 are
based on the work by Kuzenko and Ogburn [ 4 ] . Here I only include a
summary of those results which are essential for constructing a new
off-shell model for the massless integer superspin, as well as
describing (1,1) AdS higher-spin supercurrents.

Starting with simple models for a chiral scalar supermultiplet in (2,0)
AdS superspace, in section 5.6 we obtain the conservation equation
obeyed by the multiplet of higher-spin currents. This will allow us to
determine the off-shell gauge superfields which couple to the current
multiplet. Two off-shell formulations for a massless multiplet of
half-integer superspin in (2,0) AdS superspace are developed in section
5.7 . Our results, their implications and possible extensions are
discussed in section 5.8 .

### 5.1 Superconformal higher-spin multiplets

Before presenting superconformal higher-spin multiplets, let us first
give a succinct review of the formulation for @xmath conformal
supergravity following [ 113 ] . There exists a more general formulation
for conformal supergravity [ 166 ] , the so-called @xmath conformal
superspace. However, for our purposes it suffices to use the formulation
of [ 113 ] , which is obtained from the @xmath conformal superspace by
partially fixing the gauge freedom. The reader is referred to appendix
A.2 for more details on our 3D conventions.

#### 5.1.1 Conformal supergravity

All known off-shell formulations for 3D @xmath supergravity [ 113 , 83 ]
can be realised in a curved superspace @xmath with the structure group
@xmath . Here @xmath and @xmath stand for the spin group and the @xmath
-symmetry group, respectively. We parametrise the superspace by local
bosonic ( @xmath ) and fermionic ( @xmath ) coordinates @xmath , where
@xmath . The Grassmann variables @xmath and @xmath are related to each
other by complex conjugation: @xmath .

The superspace covariant derivatives have the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Here @xmath is the inverse supervielbein, while @xmath and @xmath denote
the Lorentz and @xmath connections, respectively,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The explicit relations between Lorentz generators with two vector
indices ( @xmath ), one vector index ( @xmath ) and two spinor indices (
@xmath ) are defined in appendix A.2 . The actions of the generators
@xmath on the covariant derivatives are defined as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
                       @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.3)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

The covariant derivatives obey (anti-)commutation relations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In the above, @xmath is the torsion, while @xmath and @xmath describe
the curvature. In order to describe @xmath conformal supergravity, the
torsion has to obey the covariant constraints proposed in [ 161 ] .
Solving the constraints gives the following algebra of covariant
derivatives [ 113 , 83 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
                                         
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.1.5a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.1.5b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.1.5c)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

We thus see that the algebra is parametrised by three torsion
superfields: a real scalar @xmath , a complex scalar @xmath and its
conjugate @xmath , and a real vector @xmath . The @xmath charges of the
torsion superfields @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are @xmath , @xmath and
0, respectively. They satisfy the Bianchi identities

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.6)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

Throughout this chapter, we define @xmath and @xmath .

The algebra of covariant derivatives given by ( 5.1.5 ) is invariant
under the super-Weyl transformation [ 113 , 83 ]

  -------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
                                                                                                           
                                                                       @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.1.7a)
                                                                       @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.1.7b)
                                                                       @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.1.7c)
                                                                                                  @xmath   
  which induces the following transformation of the torsion tensors:                                       
                                                                                                           
                                                                       @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.1.7d)
                                                                       @xmath   @xmath                     (5.1.7e)
                                                                       @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.1.7f)
  -------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

The parameter @xmath is an arbitrary real scalar superfield. The
super-Weyl invariance ( 5.1.7 ) is intrinsic to conformal supergravity.
For every supergravity-matter system, its action is required to be a
super-Weyl invariant functional of the supergravity multiplet coupled to
certain conformal compensators, see [ 113 , 83 ] for more details.

The @xmath supersymmetric extension of the Cotton tensor [ 167 ] is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It transforms homogeneously under ( 5.1.7 ),

and obeys the Bianchi identities [ 166 ]

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.10)

The curved superspace is conformally flat if and only if @xmath [ 166 ]
.

#### 5.1.2 Primary superfields

charge @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------

As an example, the super-Cotton tensor is super-Weyl primary of
dimension @xmath . Let us introduce several types of primary superfields
which will be important for our subsequent analysis.

A symmetric rank- @xmath spinor superfield @xmath is called longitudinal
linear if it obeys the following first-order constraint

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which implies

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.14)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

If @xmath is super-Weyl primary, the constraint ( 5.1.13 ) is consistent
provided the dimension @xmath and @xmath charge @xmath of @xmath are
related as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In the scalar case, @xmath , the constraint ( 5.1.13 ) becomes the
condition of covariant chirality, @xmath . The dimension @xmath and
@xmath charge @xmath of any primary chiral scalar superfield @xmath are
related as @xmath , in accordance with [ 113 ] .

Given a positive integer @xmath , a symmetric rank- @xmath spinor
superfield @xmath is called transverse linear if it obeys the
first-order constraint

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which implies

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

If @xmath is super-Weyl primary, then the constraint ( 5.1.16 ) is
consistent provided the dimension @xmath and @xmath charge @xmath of
@xmath are related to each other as follows:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In the @xmath case, the constraint ( 5.1.16 ) is not defined. However,
its corollary ( 5.1.17 ) is perfectly consistent,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and defines a covariantly linear scalar superfield @xmath . The
dimension @xmath and @xmath charge @xmath of any primary linear scalar
@xmath are related as @xmath , in accordance with [ 113 ] .

The constraints ( 5.1.13 ) and ( 5.1.16 ) are solved in terms of
prepotentials @xmath and @xmath as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.20a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.20b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

Provided the constraints ( 5.1.13 ) and ( 5.1.16 ) are the only
conditions imposed on @xmath and @xmath respectively, the prepotentials
@xmath and @xmath can be chosen to be unconstrained complex, and are
defined modulo gauge transformations of the form:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.21a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.1.21b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

with the gauge parameters @xmath and @xmath being unconstrained. If the
linear superfields @xmath and @xmath are super-Weyl primary, then their
prepotentials @xmath and @xmath can also be chosen to be super-Weyl
primary.

In the @xmath case, the prepotential solution ( 5.1.20b ) is still
valid. The prepotential @xmath can be chosen to be unconstrained complex
provided the constraint ( 5.1.19 ) is the only condition imposed on
@xmath . However, if we are dealing with a real linear superfield,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

then the constraints are solved [ 155 ] in terms of an unconstrained
real prepotential @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which is defined modulo gauge transformations of the form:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

If @xmath is super-Weyl primary, then eq. ( 5.1.18 ) tells us that the
dimension of @xmath is @xmath . In this case it is consistent to
consider the gauge prepotential @xmath to be inert under the super-Weyl
transformations [ 113 ] , @xmath .

#### 5.1.3 Conformal gauge superfields

Let @xmath be a positive integer. A real symmetric rank- @xmath spinor
superfield @xmath is said to be a conformal gauge supermultiplet if (i)
it is super-Weyl primary of dimension @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and (ii) it is defined modulo gauge transformations of the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.1.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with the gauge parameter @xmath being unconstrained complex. The
dimension of @xmath in ( 5.1.25 ) is uniquely fixed by requiring the
longitudinal linear superfield @xmath in the right-hand side of ( 5.1.26
) to be super-Weyl primary. Indeed, the gauge parameter @xmath must be
neutral with respect to the @xmath -symmetry group @xmath since @xmath
is real. Hence, the dimension of @xmath is equal to @xmath , in
accordance with ( 5.1.15 ).

### 5.2 Geometry of @xmath AdS superspaces

Let us briefly discuss maximally supersymmetric backgrounds in the
off-shell @xmath supergravity theories, since the superspaces @xmath and
@xmath are special examples of such supermanifolds. The most general
maximally supersymmetric backgrounds are characterised by several
conditions [ 160 ] on the torsion superfields @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
, which parametrise the superspace geometry of @xmath conformal
supergravity, see 5.1.1 . These requirements are as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.2.1a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.2.1b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The (1,1) AdS superspace is singled out by the conditions @xmath and
@xmath , with @xmath and its conjugate @xmath having non-zero constant
values [ 83 ] . On the other hand, the solution with @xmath and @xmath
corresponds to the (2,0) AdS superspace [ 83 ] . It may be shown that
the @xmath connection is flat if and only if @xmath [ 155 ] . The
non-vanishing @xmath curvature is the main reason why the structure of
massless higher-spin gauge supermultiplets in (2,0) AdS superspace [ 5 ]
considerably differs from their counterparts with (1,1) AdS
supersymmetry. This will be the subject of section 5.7 .

#### 5.2.1 (1,1) AdS superspace

In this subsection we collect salient facts about the geometry of (1,1)
AdS superspace [ 83 ] , @xmath , as well as elaborate on superfield
representations of the isometry group.

The geometry of @xmath is characterised by covariant derivatives

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

obeying the following graded commutation relations [ 83 ] :

  -- -------- -- ----------
                 
     @xmath      (5.2.3a)
     @xmath      (5.2.3b)
     @xmath      (5.2.3c)
     @xmath      (5.2.3d)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with @xmath being a complex parameter. As compared with ( 5.1.5 ), we
have denoted @xmath . In particular, of some use during calculations are
the following identities, which can derived from the algebra ( 5.2.3 ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.2.4a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.2.4b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.2.4c)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.2.4d)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.2.4e)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

These relations imply the identity

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which guarantees the reality of the actions considered in later
sections.

The covariantly transverse linear and longitudinal linear superfields on
an arbitrary supergravity background were described in the previous
section. In the case of (1,1) AdS superspace, such superfields play an
important role. One can define projectors @xmath and @xmath on the
spaces of transverse linear and longitudinal linear superfields,
respectively. The projectors are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.2.6a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.2.6b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

with the properties

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Given a complex tensor superfield @xmath with @xmath , it can be
represented as a sum of transverse linear and longitudinal linear
multiplets,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.2.8)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

Choosing @xmath to be longitudinal linear ( @xmath ) or transverse
linear ( @xmath ), the above identity gives the relations ( 5.1.20a )
and ( 5.1.20b ) for some prepotentials @xmath and @xmath , respectively.

In order to study rigid supersymmetric field theories in (1,1) AdS
superspace, a superfield description of the corresponding isometry
transformations is required. There exists a universal formalism to
determine isometries of curved superspace backgrounds in diverse
dimensions [ 35 ] . Real supervector fields @xmath on @xmath are called
Killing supervector fields if

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.2.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and @xmath corresponds to some local Lorentz parameter. As demonstrated
in [ 83 ] , the master equation ( 5.2.9 ) implies that the parameters
@xmath and @xmath are uniquely expressed in terms of the vector @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.2.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and the vector parameter obeys the equation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.2.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In comparison with the 3D @xmath Minkowski superspace, the specific
feature of @xmath is that any two of the three parameters @xmath are
expressed in terms of the third parameter, in particular

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.2.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

From ( 5.2.10 ) and ( 5.2.12 ) we deduce

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.2.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

These Killing supervector fields can be shown to generate the isometry
group of @xmath , which is @xmath .

In Minkowski superspace @xmath , there are two ways to generate
supersymmetric invariants, one of which corresponds to the integration
over the full superspace and the other over its chiral subspace. In
(1,1) AdS superspace, every chiral integral can always be recast as a
full superspace integral. Associated with a scalar superfield @xmath is
the following supersymmetric invariant

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.2.14)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath denotes the chiral integration measure. Let @xmath be a
covariantly chiral scalar Lagrangian, @xmath . It generates a
supersymmetric invariant of the form @xmath The specific feature of
(1,1) AdS superspace is that the chiral action can equivalently be
written as an integral over the full superspace [ 83 ]

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.2.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Unlike the flat superspace case, the integral on the right does not
vanish in AdS.

Supersymmetric invariant ( 5.2.14 ) can be reduced to component fields
by the rule [ 160 ]

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.2.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with @xmath . Here @xmath is the inverse vielbein, which determines the
torsion-free covariant derivative of AdS space

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.2.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In general, the @xmath -independent component, @xmath , of a superfield
@xmath is denoted by @xmath . To complete the formalism of component
reduction, we only need the following relation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.2.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In what follows, we will work with full superspace integrals only and
make use of the notation @xmath .

#### 5.2.2 (2,0) AdS superspace

Let us briefly review the key results concerning (2,0) AdS superspace,
@xmath ; see [ 83 , 168 ] for the details. There are two ways to
describe the geometry of (2,0) AdS superspace, which correspond to
making use of either a real or complex basis for the spinor covariant
derivatives. Here we first consider the formulation in the complex
basis.

The geometry of @xmath is described by covariant derivatives

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.2.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

obeying the following algebra

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.2.20a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.2.20b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.2.20c)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.2.20d)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

Here the parameter @xmath is related to the AdS scalar curvature as
@xmath .

The covariant derivatives of (2,0) AdS superspace hold various
identities, which can be easily derived from the algebra ( 5.2.20 ).
Some of the useful ones include

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.2.21a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.2.21b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.2.21c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

These relations imply

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.2.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which guarantees the reality of the actions considered in the later
sections.

In accordance with the general formalism of [ 35 ] , the isometries of
(2,0) AdS superspace are generated by the Killing supervector fields
@xmath , which are defined to solve the master equation

  ------- -------- -- -----------
                      
          @xmath      (5.2.23a)
  where               
                      
          @xmath      (5.2.23b)
  ------- -------- -- -----------

and @xmath and @xmath are some real U(1) @xmath and Lorentz superfield
parameters, respectively. It follows from eq. ( 5.2.23 ) that the
parameters @xmath and @xmath are uniquely expressed in terms of the
vector parameter @xmath as follows:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.2.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The vector parameter @xmath satisfies the equation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.2.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This implies the standard Killing equation,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.2.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

One may also prove the following relations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.2.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

see [ 83 ] for derivations. The Killing supervector fields prove to
generate the supergroup @xmath , which is the isometry group of (2,0)
AdS superspace. Rigid supersymmetric field theories in (2,0) AdS
superspace are required to be invariant under the isometry
transformations. An infinitesimal isometry transformation acts on a
tensor superfield (with suppressed indices) by the rule

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.2.28)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Associated with a real scalar superfield @xmath is the following
supersymmetric invariant

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.2.29)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

### 5.3 Massless half-integer superspin gauge theories in (1,1) AdS
superspace

The results presented in this section were obtained by Daniel Ogburn [ 4
] .

The conformal higher-spin gauge superfields @xmath (see 5.1.3 ) at least
for @xmath , with @xmath can be used to construct massless actions in
two of the three @xmath maximally symmetric backgrounds, which are
Minkowski superspace [ 49 ] and (1,1) AdS superspace [ 4 ] . Such
actions, however, involve not only @xmath but also some compensators.

It is worth pointing out that all massless higher-spin supermultiplets
in 3D (1,1) AdS superspace may be obtained from their counterparts in 4D
@xmath AdS superspace [ 63 ] by dimensional reduction. In practice,
however, carrying out such a reduction proves to be a non-trivial
technical task. To explain this, let us consider the longitudinal
formulation for massless superspin- @xmath multiplets, with @xmath , in
four and three dimensions. ¹ ¹ 1 The @xmath case corresponds to
linearised supergravity. In the 4D @xmath AdS case [ 63 ] , the massless
superspin- @xmath multiplet is described by a real unconstrained gauge
superfield @xmath , a complex longitudinal linear compensator @xmath and
its conjugate. The dimensional reduction of @xmath leads to a family of
real unconstrained symmetric superfields @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath . Next, the dimensional reduction of @xmath leads to a family of
constrained 3D superfields, which include a complex longitudinal linear
compensator @xmath and some lower-spin supermultiplets.

As will be shown later, the massless superspin- @xmath multiplet in 3D
(1,1) AdS superspace is described by the gauge superfield @xmath , the
compensator @xmath and its conjugate. The above consideration makes it
clear that the naive @xmath dimensional reduction leads to the massless
superspin- @xmath multiplet intertwined with lower-superspin multiplets.
The non-trivial technical task is to disentangle the pure superspin-
@xmath multiplet from the rest. This was explicitly done in [ 83 ] for
the @xmath case, for which dimensional reduction leads to two
supermultiplets in (1,1) AdS superspace: a massless superspin- @xmath
multiplet and a massless vector supermultiplet. Instead of carrying out
dimensional reduction, it proves to be more efficient to recast the 4D
gauge principle of [ 63 ] in a 3D form and use it to construct
gauge-invariant actions. This is the approach advocated in [ 49 , 4 ] .

We recall the constructions presented in [ 49 ] . There exist two
off-shell formulations for the massless @xmath multiplet of superspin-
@xmath , which describe two propagating massless fields with spin-
@xmath and spin- @xmath on Minkowski space [ 49 ] . These dually
equivalent formulations, known as transverse and longitudinal, differ in
the compensators used.

Let us extend these gauge theories to (1,1) AdS superspace. There exist
two formulations which are described in terms of the following dynamical
variables

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.3.1a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.3.1b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

Here @xmath is an unconstrained real superfield. The complex superfields
@xmath and @xmath are transverse linear and longitudinal linear in the
sense that they obey the constraints ( 5.1.16 ) and ( 5.1.13 ),
respectively. In accordance with ( 5.1.20 ), these constraints can be
solved in terms of unconstrained complex prepotentials as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.3.2a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.3.2b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

These prepotentials are defined modulo gauge transformations of the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.3.3a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.3.3b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

with the gauge parameters @xmath and @xmath being unconstrained complex.

The dynamical superfields @xmath and @xmath are postulated to be defined
modulo gauge transformations of the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.3.4a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.3.4b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.3.4c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

where the complex gauge parameter @xmath is unconstrained. The gauge
transformation of @xmath coincides with ( 5.1.26 ) for @xmath . From
@xmath , we can read off the gauge transformation of the prepotential
@xmath , which is

  -- -- -- ---------
           (5.3.5)
  -- -- -- ---------

In the transverse formulation, the quadratic action invariant under the
gauge transformations ( 5.3.4a ) and ( 5.3.4b ) is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.3.6)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

In the flat superspace limit, this action reduces to the one derived in
[ 49 ] .

The @xmath choice was excluded from the above consideration, since the
constraint ( 5.1.16 ) is not defined for @xmath . However, the corollary
( 5.1.17 ) of ( 5.1.16 ) is perfectly consistent for @xmath and defines
a covariantly transverse linear scalar superfield ( 5.1.19 ),

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We therefore postulate @xmath and its conjugate @xmath to be the
compensators in the @xmath case. The gauge transformations ( 5.3.4a )
and ( 5.3.4b ) then become

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.3.8a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.3.8b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The variation @xmath is compatible with the constraint ( 5.3.7 ), that
is @xmath . Finally, choosing @xmath in ( 5.3.6 ) gives the linearised
action for non-minimal (1,1) AdS supergravity, which was originally
derived in section 9.2 of [ 83 ] .

In the longitudinal formulation, the action invariant under the gauge
transformations ( 5.3.4a ) and ( 5.3.4c ) is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.3.9)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

As shown in [ 4 ] , the longitudinal action may be derived from the
transverse one by performing a superfield duality transformation.

In the @xmath case, the compensator @xmath becomes covariantly chiral,
@xmath . Choosing @xmath in ( 5.3.9 ) gives the linearised action for
minimal (1,1) AdS supergravity, which was originally derived in section
9.1 of [ 83 ] , provided we identify @xmath . The corresponding gauge
transformations are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.3.10a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.3.10b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

It is clear that the variation @xmath is covariantly chiral.

### 5.4 Massless integer superspin gauge theories in (1,1) AdS
superspace

The results in subsections 5.4.1 and 5.4.2 were obtained by Daniel
Ogburn [ 4 ] .

When attempting to develop a Lagrangian formulation for a massless
multiplet of superspin @xmath , where @xmath , a naive expectation is
that the dynamical variables of such a theory should consist of a
conformal gauge superfield @xmath , introduced in subsection 5.1.3 , in
conjunction with some compensator(s). Instead, our approach in this
section will be based on developing 3D @xmath analogues of the two
dually equivalent off-shell formulations, the so-called longitudinal and
transverse ones, for the massless @xmath multiplets of integer superspin
in AdS @xmath [ 63 ] . As the next step, we will construct a generalised
longitudinal model, in a way similar to the one proposed in the 4D
@xmath AdS case in subsection 4.2.1 . Such a reformulation naturally
leads to the appearance of the conformal gauge superfield @xmath .

#### 5.4.1 Longitudinal formulation

Given an integer @xmath , the longitudinal formulation for the massless
superspin- @xmath multiplet is realised in terms of the following
dynamical variables:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.4.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Here @xmath is an unconstrained real superfield, and the complex
superfield @xmath is longitudinal linear, eq. ( 5.1.13 ). In accordance
with ( 5.1.20a ), the constraint ( 5.1.13 ) can be solved in terms of an
unconstrained complex prepotential @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.4.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which is defined modulo gauge transformations of the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.4.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with the gauge parameter @xmath being unconstrained complex.

We postulate the dynamical superfields @xmath and @xmath to be defined
modulo gauge transformations of the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.4a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.4b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

Here the gauge parameter @xmath is an unconstrained complex superfield,
and @xmath is transverse linear. From ( 5.4.4b ) we read off the gauge
transformation law of the prepotential,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.4.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Modulo an overall normalisation factor, there is a unique quadratic
action which is invariant under the gauge transformations ( 5.4.4 ). The
action is

  -- -------- -------- -- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath               (5.4.6)
                          @xmath   
                          @xmath   
                          @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -- -------- ---------

The special @xmath case, which corresponds to the massless gravitino
multiplet, will be studied in more detail in subsection 5.4.4 .

#### 5.4.2 Transverse formulation

The transverse formulation for the massless superspin- @xmath multiplet
is realised in terms of the following dynamical variables:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.4.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Here @xmath is the same as in ( 5.4.1 ), and the complex superfield
@xmath is transverse linear, eq. ( 5.1.16 ). In accordance with (
5.1.20b ), the constraint on @xmath is solved in terms of an
unconstrained prepotential @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.4.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which is defined modulo gauge transformations of the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.4.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with the gauge parameter @xmath being unconstrained.

The transverse formulation for the massless superspin- @xmath multiplet
is described by the following action

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.4.10)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

which is invariant under the gauge transformation ( 5.4.4a ) accompanied
with

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath                     (5.4.11)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

where @xmath .

#### 5.4.3 Reformulation of the longitudinal theory

Let us take a step further and consider a generalisation of the
longitudinal formulation ( 5.4.6 ). This can be achieved by enlarging
the gauge freedom ( 5.4.4 ), where we choose to work with an
unconstrained complex gauge parameter @xmath , instead of the transverse
linear superfield @xmath . As a result, we are required to introduce a
new purely gauge superfield, in addition to @xmath , @xmath and @xmath .
In such a setting, the gauge freedom of @xmath coincides with that of a
complex conformal gauge superfield.

Given a positive integer @xmath , a massless superspin- @xmath multiplet
in @xmath can be described using a complex unconstrained prepotential
@xmath , a real superfield @xmath and a complex superfield @xmath
constrained to be transverse linear,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The constraint ( 5.4.12 ) is solved in terms of a complex unconstrained
prepotential @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which is defined modulo gauge shift

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Here the gauge parameter @xmath is unconstrained.

The gauge freedom of @xmath is given by

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                       @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.15a)
  with unconstrained gauge parameters @xmath and @xmath . We further postulate the linearised gauge transformations for the superfields @xmath and @xmath as follows                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                       @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.15b)
                                                                                                                                                                       @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.15c)
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

The longitudinal linear superfield @xmath defined by ( 5.4.2 ) is
invariant under the @xmath -transformation ( 5.4.15a ). It varies under
the @xmath -transformation as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.16)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The action

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.4.17)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

possesses the gauge invariance ( 5.4.15 ) and, by construction, ( 5.4.14
). The above action is real due to the identity ( 5.2.22 ).

Due to the @xmath -gauge freedom ( 5.4.15 ), we are free to make the
gauge choice

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

by which we regain the original longitudinal action for the massless
superspin- @xmath multiplet ( 5.4.6 ). The gauge condition ( 5.4.18 )
does not fix completely the @xmath -gauge freedom. The residual gauge
transformations are generated by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with @xmath being an unconstrained superfield. With this expression for
@xmath , the gauge transformations ( 5.4.15a ) and ( 5.4.15b ) coincide
with ( 5.4.4b ). Thus, the action ( 5.4.17 ) indeed provides an
off-shell formulation for the massless superspin- @xmath multiplet in
(1,1) AdS superspace.

The action ( 5.4.17 ) contains a single term which involves the gauge
prepotential @xmath and not the field strength @xmath . This term can be
written as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.20)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The former makes the gauge symmetry ( 5.4.14 ) manifestly realised,
while the latter turns the @xmath -transformation ( 5.4.15a ) into a
manifest symmetry. If we instead wish to make use of ( 5.4.20 ), we
obtain a different representation for the action ( 5.4.17 ). It is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.4.21)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

It is worth discussing the structure of the dynamical variable @xmath .
This superfield is unconstrained complex, and its gauge transformation
law is given by eq. ( 5.4.15a ). Comparing ( 5.4.15a ) with the gauge
transformation law ( 5.1.26 ) with @xmath , which corresponds to the
conformal gauge superfield @xmath , we see that @xmath may be
interpreted as a complex conformal gauge superfield.

#### 5.4.4 Massless gravitino multiplet

The massless gravitino multiplet, which corresponds to the @xmath case,
was excluded from our consideration of the previous subsection. Here we
will fill the gap.

The (generalised) longitudinal formulation for the gravitino multiplet
is described by the action

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.4.22)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

where @xmath is a covariantly chiral scalar superfield, @xmath , and

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This action is invariant under gauge transformations of the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.24a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.24b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.24c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

where the gauge parameters @xmath and @xmath are unconstrained complex
superfields.

The gauge @xmath -freedom ( 5.4.24 ) allows us to impose the condition
@xmath . In this gauge the action ( 5.4.22 ) turns into ( 5.4.6 ) with
@xmath , and the residual gauge @xmath -freedom is described by @xmath ,
where the spinor gauge parameter @xmath is unconstrained complex.

The action ( 5.4.22 ) involves the chiral scalar @xmath and its
conjugate only in the combination @xmath , where @xmath . This means
that the model ( 5.4.22 ) possesses a dual formulation realised in terms
of a real linear superfield subject to the constraint ( 5.1.22 ).

#### 5.4.5 @xmath superspace reduction

Every supersymmetric field theory in (1,1) AdS superspace @xmath may be
reformulated in terms of superfields on @xmath AdS superspace. ² ² 2 In
the case of @xmath AdS supersymmetry, both notations @xmath and @xmath
are used in the literature. We will also use the notation @xmath for
@xmath AdS superspace. Let us briefly discuss how to perform such a
reduction.

First, it proves to be advantageous to switch to the real basis for the
(1,1) AdS spinor covariant derivatives. Following [ 155 ] , we can
introduce a real basis for the spinor covariant derivatives which is
obtained by replacing the complex operators @xmath and @xmath with
@xmath , where @xmath , defined by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where we have represented @xmath . The new covariant derivatives can be
shown to obey the algebra:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.26a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.26b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.26c)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.26d)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

The graded commutation relations for the operators @xmath and @xmath
form a closed algebra. Indeed, they are isomorphic to those defining the
@xmath AdS superspace, see [ 155 ] for the details. These properties
mean that (1,0) AdS superspace is naturally embedded in (1,1) AdS
superspace as a subspace. The Grassmann variables @xmath may be chosen
in such a way that (1,0) AdS corresponds to the surface defined by
@xmath . It is thus possible to carry out a consistent (1,1) @xmath
(1,0) AdS superspace reduction for all the higher-spin supersymmetric
gauge theories constructed in sections 5.3 and 5.4 . Implementation of
this program will be described elsewhere.

For concreteness, let us consider the @xmath superspace reduction of the
longitudinal model for massless superspin- @xmath multiplet ( 5.4.6 ).
Here our analysis is restricted to the flat superspace case for
simplicity.

In order to be consistent with the previous work [ 50 ] , in which the
@xmath superspace reduction of the massless superspin- @xmath models of
[ 49 ] was studied, we denote by @xmath and @xmath the spinor covariant
derivatives of @xmath Minkowski superspace @xmath . They obey the
anti-commutation relations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In order to carry out the @xmath superspace reduction, it is useful to
introduce real Grassmann coordinates @xmath for @xmath , where @xmath .
We define these coordinates by choosing the corresponding spinor
covariant derivatives @xmath as in [ 169 ] :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.28)
  -- -------- -- ----------

From ( 5.4.27 ) we deduce

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Given an @xmath superfield @xmath , we define its @xmath bar-projection

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.30)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which is a superfield on @xmath Minkowski superspace @xmath parametrised
by real Cartesian coordinates @xmath , where @xmath . The spinor
covariant derivative of @xmath Minkowski superspace @xmath obeys the
anti-commutation relation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.31)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Finally, the @xmath superspace reduction of the @xmath supersymmetric
action is carried out using the rule [ 50 ]

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.32)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Given an integer @xmath , the longitudinal formulation for the massless
superspin- @xmath multiplet is realised in terms of the following
dynamical variables:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.33)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Here @xmath is an unconstrained real superfield, and the complex
superfield @xmath is longitudinal linear,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.34)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The dynamical superfields are defined modulo gauge transformations of
the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.35a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.35b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

where the gauge parameter @xmath is an arbitrary transverse linear
superfield,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.36)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The gauge-invariant action is

  -- -------- -------- -- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath               (5.4.37)
                          @xmath   
                          @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -- -------- ----------

Making use of the representation ( 5.4.28 ), the transverse linear
constraint ( 5.4.36 ) takes the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.38)
  -- -------- -- ----------

It follows that @xmath has two independent @xmath -components, which
are:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.39)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The gauge transformation of @xmath , eq. ( 5.4.35 ), allows us to impose
two conditions

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.40)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In this gauge we define the following unconstrained real @xmath
superfields:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.41a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.41b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

The residual gauge freedom, which preserves the gauge conditions (
5.4.40 ), is described by unconstrained real @xmath superfield
parameters @xmath and @xmath defined by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.42a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.42b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

The gauge transformation laws of the superfields ( 5.4.41 ) are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.43a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.43b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

We now turn to reducing @xmath to @xmath superspace. From the point of
view of @xmath supersymmetry, @xmath is equivalent to two unconstrained
complex superfields, which we define as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.44a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.44b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

Making use of the gauge transformation ( 5.4.35 ) gives

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------
                                         
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.4.45a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.4.45b)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------

At this stage one should recall that upon imposing the @xmath
supersymmetric gauge conditions ( 6.2.3 ) the residual gauge freedom is
described by the gauge parameters ( 5.4.42a ) and ( 5.4.42b ). From (
5.4.45 ) we read off the gauge transformations of the @xmath complex
superfields ( 5.4.44 )

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------
                                         
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.4.46a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.4.46b)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------

In the @xmath supersymmetric gauge ( 5.4.40 ), @xmath is described by
two unconstrained real superfields @xmath and @xmath defined according
to ( 5.4.41 ), and their gauge transformation laws are given by eqs. (
5.4.43a ) and ( 5.4.43b ), respectively. It follows from the gauge
transformations ( 5.4.43a ), ( 5.4.43b ) and ( 5.4.46 ) that in fact we
are dealing with two different gauge theories. One of them is formulated
in terms of the unconstrained real gauge superfields

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.47)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which are defined modulo gauge transformations of the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.48a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.48b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.48c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

where the gauge parameter @xmath is unconstrained real. The other theory
is described by the gauge superfields

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.49)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with the following gauge freedom

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.50a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.50b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.50c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

Applying the reduction rule ( 5.4.32 ) to the action ( 5.4.37 ) gives
two decoupled @xmath supersymmetric actions, which are described in
terms of the dynamical variables ( 5.4.47 ) and ( 5.4.49 ),
respectively. In the former case, the superfield @xmath is auxiliary.
Integrating it out, we arrive at the following action:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.4.51)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

This action is invariant under the gauge transformations ( 5.4.48a ) and
( 5.4.48b ).

In the latter case, the superfield @xmath is auxiliary. Integrating it
out, we obtain the following gauge-invariant action:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.4.52)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

This action is invariant under the gauge transformations ( 5.4.50a ) and
( 5.4.50b ). Modulo an overall normalisation factor, ( 5.4.52 )
coincides with the off-shell @xmath supersymmetric action for massless
superspin- @xmath multiplet [ 50 ] in the form given in [ 51 ] .

The action ( 5.4.51 ) defines a new @xmath supersymmetric higher-spin
theory which did not appear in the analysis of [ 50 ] . It may be shown
that at the component level it reduces, upon imposing a Wess-Zumino
gauge and eliminating the auxiliary fields, to a sum of two massless
actions. One of them is the bosonic Fronsdal-type spin- @xmath model and
the other is the fermionic Fang-Fronsdal-type spin- @xmath model.

### 5.5 Higher-spin (1,1) AdS supercurrents

Inspired by the analysis of Dumitrescu and Seiberg [ 79 ] , the most
general supercurrent multiplets for theories with (1,1) AdS or (2,0) AdS
supersymmetry were introduced in [ 83 ] , with the (1,1) AdS case being
a natural extension of the 4D @xmath AdS supercurrents classified in [
99 , 100 ] . Here we will formulate higher-spin supercurrent multiplets
in (1,1) AdS superspace by making use of the off-shell massless
supersymmetric higher-spin theories constructed in the previous two
sections. Our analysis will be mostly analogous to that in the 4D case.

#### 5.5.1 Non-conformal supercurrents: Half-integer superspin

The two formulations for the massless half-integer superspin which were
described in section 5.3 lead to different higher-spin supercurrent
multiplet. Following similar derivations as in subsections 3.3.1 and
4.3.2 , one may show that the most general half-integer superspin
current multiplet is described by the conservation equation

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                 @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.5.1a)
                                                                                                                                                                            @xmath   
  Here the higher-spin supercurrent @xmath is a real superfield. The trace multiplets @xmath and @xmath are complex superfields constrained by                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                 @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.5.1b)
                                                                                                                                                 @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.5.1c)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

and therefore @xmath is a transverse linear superfield, while @xmath is
longitudinal linear. The multiplet with @xmath corresponds to the
longitudinal formulation for massless superspin- @xmath multiplet (
5.3.9 ). The case @xmath is associated with the transverse formulation (
5.3.6 ). In this way, we have 3D counterparts of the 4D half-integer
superspin current multiplets given by ( 4.3.8 ) and ( 4.3.9 ).

We can also construct a well-defined improvement transformation which
converts the longitudinal higher-spin supercurrent to the transverse
one, thus showing that they are indeed equivalent. The most general
higher-spin supercurrent ( 5.5.1 ) can be modified by an improvement
transformation

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.5.2a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.5.2b)
     @xmath   @xmath               (5.5.2c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

with @xmath and @xmath well-defined operators.

The transverse linearity constraint ( 5.5.1b ) can always be solved in
the (1,1) AdS geometry as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.5.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for well-defined real tensor operators @xmath and @xmath . This property
means that we can always set @xmath to zero by applying a certain
improvement transformation ( 5.5.2 ). The above analysis shows that the
longitudinal and transverse supercurrents are equivalent. The situation
proves to be analogous in the integer superspin case, for which we will
formulate in the next subsection a higher-spin supercurrent associated
with the new gauge formulation ( 5.4.21 ). Therefore, it suffices to
work with one of them, say, the longitudinal supercurrent multiplet
@xmath , which obeys the conservation equation

  -- -- -- ---------
           (5.5.4)
  -- -- -- ---------

For completeness, we also give the conjugate equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.5.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Before we proceed to the construction of higher-spin supercurrents for
(1,1) AdS supersymmetric field theories, let us first recall our
condensed notation in complete analogy with the four-dimensional
analysis. We introduce auxiliary real variables @xmath and associate
with any tensor superfield @xmath the following index-free field

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.5.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath in @xmath .
Furthermore, we make use of the bosonic variables @xmath and the
corresponding partial derivatives @xmath to convert the spinor and
vector covariant derivatives into index-free operators. In the case of
(1,1) AdS superspace, we introduce operators that increase the degree of
homogeneity in @xmath ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.5.7a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.5.7b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

We also introduce two operators that decrease the degree of homogeneity
in the variable @xmath , specifically

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.5.8)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

The transverse linear condition ( 5.5.1b ) and its conjugate can be
written as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.5.9a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.5.9b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The conservation equations ( 5.5.4 ) and ( 5.5.5 ) turn into

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.5.10a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.5.10b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

where

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Since @xmath , the conservation equation ( 5.5.10a ) is consistent
provided

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This is indeed true, as a consequence of the transverse linear condition
( 5.5.9a ).

##### 5.5.1.1 Models for a chiral superfield

We now give several examples of higher-spin supercurrents introduced
above by studying rigid supersymmetric field theories in (1,1) AdS
superspace.

Our first example is the superconformal theory of a single chiral scalar
superfield

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is covariantly chiral, @xmath . The corresponding conformal
higher-spin supercurrent is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.5.14)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

which is a minimal extension of the conserved supercurrent constructed
in flat @xmath Minkowski superspace [ 109 ] . It may be checked that for
@xmath , the real higher-spin supercurrent @xmath satisfies the
conservation equation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

by virtue of the massless equations of motion, @xmath .

Let us now add the mass term to ( 5.5.13 ) and consider the following
action

  -- -- -- ----------
           (5.5.16)
  -- -- -- ----------

with @xmath a complex mass parameter. The equations of motion are

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

After some lengthy calculations (see [ 4 ] for the derivation), the
equations of motion imply that on-shell the higher-spin supercurrent
multiplet takes the form

  --------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                                                        
                                          @xmath                        (5.5.18a)
                                          @xmath                        (5.5.18b)
  with the coefficients @xmath given by                                 
                                                                        
                                          @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
                                                            @xmath      
  --------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

This is the (1,1) AdS analogue of the non-conformal supercurrents
presented in 4.4.2 . Indeed, the same selection rules also emerge since
one can verify that the conservation equation ( 5.5.10b ) and the
transverse linearity constraint ( 5.5.9b ) are identically satisfied
only for the odd values of @xmath with @xmath . In this sense our (1,1)
AdS higher-spin supercurrents are very similar to the 4D @xmath
Minkowski and AdS cases studied in subsections 3.3.1.1 and 4.4.2 ,
respectively.

##### 5.5.1.2 Superconformal model with @xmath chiral superfields

Another interesting example is a generalisation of the superconformal
model ( 5.5.13 ) to the case of @xmath covariantly chiral scalar
superfields @xmath , @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This model is characterised by two different types of conformal
supercurrents, which we denote by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.5.20)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

and

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.5.21)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

Here @xmath and @xmath are arbitrary real symmetric and antisymmetric
constant matrices, respectively. We have put an overall factor @xmath in
eq. ( 5.5.21 ) in order to make @xmath real. The currents ( 5.5.20 ) and
( 5.5.21 ) obey the conservation equation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The above results can be recast in terms of the matrix conformal
supercurrent @xmath with components

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.5.23)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

which is Hermitian, @xmath . The chiral action ( 5.5.19 ) possesses
rigid @xmath symmetry acting on the chiral column-vector @xmath ) by
@xmath , with @xmath . This implies that the supercurrent ( 5.5.23 )
transforms as @xmath .

#### 5.5.2 Non-conformal supercurrents: Integer superspin

Let us now consider the new gauge formulation ( 5.4.17 ), or
equivalently ( 5.4.21 ), for the integer superspin- @xmath multiplet to
derive the 3D analogue of the non-conformal higher-spin supercurrents
formulated in 4.3.4 .

As usual, we first couple the prepotentials @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
to some external sources through the action

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.5.24)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

The action @xmath should be invariant under the @xmath -transformation (
5.4.15a ), which demands the source @xmath to be transverse linear,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Next, the action @xmath should also preserve the @xmath -gauge freedom (
5.4.14 ). This requires @xmath to be longitudinal linear

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Finally, imposing the invariance of @xmath under the @xmath
-transformation ( 5.4.15 ) leads to the following conservation equation

  -------------------------- -------- -- -----------
                                         
                             @xmath      (5.5.27a)
  as well as its conjugate               
                                         
                             @xmath      (5.5.27b)
  -------------------------- -------- -- -----------

Taking the sum of ( 5.5.27a ) and ( 5.5.27b ) leads to

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.28)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As a consequence of ( 5.5.26 ), the conservation equation ( 5.5.28 )
implies

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Employing the condensed notation, the transverse linear condition (
5.5.25 ) turns into

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.5.30)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

while the longitudinal linear condition ( 5.5.26 ) takes the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.5.31)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The conservation equation ( 5.5.27a ) becomes

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.32)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and ( 5.5.29 ) takes the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.33)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As an example, let us go back to the massive chiral multiplet model (
5.5.16 )

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.34)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the mass parameter @xmath is now real. ³ ³ 3 This is analogous to
the massive hypermultiplet model considered in ( 4.5.1 ), where it is
always possible to make the mass parameter real by changing of
variables.

In the massless case, @xmath , this model is characterised by a
fermionic supercurrent @xmath , which only exists for even values of
@xmath . In condensed notation, it has the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.5.35)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The above is the (1,1) AdS counterpart of the integer supercurrent (
4.5.14 ). One may check that for @xmath , the conservation equations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.36)
  -- -------- -- ----------

hold on-shell.

In the massive case, we need to solve a more general conservation
equation given by ( 5.5.33 ). After some calculations, one may show that
the on-shell conditions ( 5.5.17 ) imply

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------
                                         
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.5.37a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.5.37b)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------

The latter allows us to deduce the explicit form of the trace multiplet
@xmath , which is a longitudinal linear superfield ( 5.5.31 ) and obeys
( 5.5.33 ), as a consequence of the conservation equation ( 5.5.32 ).
This guides us to choose an ansatz of the form

  -- -------- -------- -- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath               (5.5.38)
                          @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -- -------- ----------

Condition ( 5.5.33 ) implies that the coefficients must be related by

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                @xmath                        (5.5.39a)
  For @xmath , the following recurrence relations are obtained by the requirement ( 5.5.32 ):                                 
                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.5.39b)
  It also follows from ( 5.5.33 ) that                                                                                        
                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.5.39c)
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

The above conditions lead to a simple expression for @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.5.40)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath and the parameter @xmath is even for @xmath to be non-zero.

### 5.6 Higher-spin supercurrents for chiral matter in (2,0) AdS
superspace

We now turn to describing the off-shell constructions of higher-spin
gauge supermultiplets in (2,0) AdS superspace [ 5 ] , which prove to be
less trivial. As pointed out in the introduction, the massless 3D
constructions of [ 4 , 49 ] , were largely modelled on the 4D results of
[ 63 , 64 ] . With respect to 3D (2,0) AdS supersymmetry, unfortunately
there is no 4D intuition to guide us, and new ideas are required in
order to construct higher-spin gauge supermultiplets. The approach
employed in [ 5 ] was based on an observation that has often been used
in the past to formulate off-shell supergravity multiplets [ 58 , 88 ,
84 , 85 , 86 , 87 ] . The idea is to make use of a higher-spin extension
of the supercurrent. Specifically, for a simple supersymmetric model in
(2,0) AdS superspace we identify a multiplet of conserved higher-spin
currents. In general, the multiplet of currents is always off-shell.
Using the constructed higher-spin supercurrent, we may identify a
corresponding off-shell supermultiplet of higher-spin fields.

We begin with some simple models for a chiral scalar supermultiplet in
@xmath AdS superspace and try to derive the corresponding higher-spin
supercurrent multiplet.

#### 5.6.1 Massless models

Let us first consider a massless model. Its action

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.6.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is invariant under the isometry transformations of (2,0) AdS superspace
for any U(1) @xmath charge @xmath of the chiral superfield,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.6.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The action is superconformal provided @xmath .

Let us first consider the superconformal case, @xmath . The analysis
given in subsection 5.5.1.1 implies that the theory possesses a real,
bosonic supercurrent @xmath , for any positive integer @xmath , which
obeys the conservation equation

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.6.3)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

This supercurrent proves to have the same form as in the (1,1) AdS case,
given by ( 5.5.14 ). Specifically, the higher-spin supercurrent is given
by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.6.4)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

Making use of the massless equations of motion, @xmath , one may check
that ( 5.6.4 ) does obey the conservation equation ( 5.6.3 ). In the
flat superspace limit, the supercurrent ( 5.6.4 ) reduces to the one
constructed in [ 109 ] .

Now we turn to the non-superconformal case, @xmath . Direct calculations
give

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                           @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.6.5a)
  where we have denoted                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                           @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.6.5b)
                                                                                                                                                                      @xmath   
  The trace multiplet @xmath is covariantly linear,                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                           @xmath                              (5.6.5c)
  as a consequence of the equations of motion and the identity ( 5.2.21c ). It is seen that @xmath has nonzero real and imaginary parts,                                       
                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                           @xmath                              (5.6.5d)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

except for the @xmath case which is characterised by @xmath . For @xmath
the above results agree with [ 83 ] .

The above results can be used to derive higher-spin supercurrents in a
non-minimal scalar supermultiplet model described by the action

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.6.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath being a complex linear superfield. The non-minimal theory (
5.6.6 ) proves to be dual to ( 5.6.1 ) provided the U(1) @xmath weight
of @xmath is opposite to that of @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.6.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Replacing @xmath and @xmath in ( 5.6.5 ) gives the higher-spin
supercurrents in the non-minimal theory ( 5.6.6 ), which is similar to
the 4D case [ 116 , 3 ] .

Let us also mention that in deriving eq. ( 5.6.5 ), one may find the
following identities useful. We start with the obvious relations

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.6.8a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.6.8b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

To simplify eq. ( 5.6.8b ), we may push @xmath , say, to the left
provided that we take into account its commutator with @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.6.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Associated with the Lorentz generators are the operators

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.6.10)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath appears in the right-hand side of ( 5.6.9 ). This operator
annihilates every superfield @xmath of the form ( 5.5.6 ),

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.6.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

From the above consideration, it follows that

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.6.12a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.6.12b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

We also state some other properties which we often use throughout our
calculations

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.6.13a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.6.13b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.6.13c)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.6.13d)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.6.13e)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

#### 5.6.2 Massive model

We consider the addition of a mass term to the functional ( 5.6.1 )

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.6.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with @xmath a complex mass parameter. In the @xmath case, the U(1)
@xmath weight of @xmath is uniquely fixed to be @xmath , in order for
the action to be @xmath -invariant.

Making use of the massive equations of motion

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.6.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

we obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.6.16)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

where @xmath is defined by ( 5.6.4 ). We observe that ( 5.6.16 ) can
also be written in the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.6.17)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

Thus, for all odd values of @xmath ,

  --------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------
                                                                                          
                                                      @xmath                              (5.6.18a)
  we end up with the conservation equation                                                
                                                                                          
                                                      @xmath                              (5.6.18b)
  where we have denoted                                                                   
                                                                                          
                                                      @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.6.18c)
                                                      @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.6.18d)
                                                                                 @xmath   
  The trace multiplet @xmath is covariantly linear,                                       
                                                                                          
                                                      @xmath                              (5.6.18e)
  --------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------

The conservation equation defined by eqs. ( 5.6.18b ) and ( 5.6.18e )
coincides with that defined by eqs. ( 5.6.5a ) and ( 5.6.5c ).

The above analysis demonstrates that in the massive case, the
higher-spin supercurrent @xmath exists only for the odd values of @xmath
. This conclusion is again analogous to our previous results in 4D and
(1,1) AdS superspace. As demonstrated in the construction of AdS
higher-spin supercurrents (see 4.4.4 ), the even values of @xmath are
also allowed provided there are several massive chiral superfields in
the theory. This analysis may be extended to the (2,0) AdS case.

### 5.7 Massless higher-spin gauge theories in (2,0) AdS superspace

The explicit structure of the higher-spin supercurrent multiplet defined
by eqs. ( 5.6.5a ) and ( 5.6.5c ) allows us to develop two off-shell
formulations for a massless multiplet of half-integer superspin- @xmath
, with @xmath . We will call them type II and type III series ⁴ ⁴ 4 Type
I series will be referred to as the longitudinal formulation for the
gauge massless half-integer superspin multiplets in (1,1) AdS superspace
( 5.3.9 ) and Minkowski superspace [ 49 ] . The type I series and its
dual are naturally related to the off-shell formulations for massless
higher-spin @xmath supermultiplets in four dimensions [ 64 , 65 , 63 ] .
The type II and type III series have no four-dimensional counterpart. to
comply with the terminology introduced in [ 83 ] for the minimal
off-shell formulations for @xmath supergravity ( @xmath ).

#### 5.7.1 Type II series

Given a positive integer @xmath , we propose to describe a massless
multiplet of superspin- @xmath in terms of two unconstrained real
superfields

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.7.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Here @xmath and @xmath are symmetric in their spinor indices.

We postulate gauge transformations for the dynamical superfields:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.7.2a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.7.2b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

where the gauge parameter @xmath is unconstrained complex. Eq. ( 5.7.2a
) implies that the complex gauge parameter @xmath is a covariantly
longitudinal linear superfield,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.7.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The gauge transformation of @xmath , eq. ( 5.7.2a ), corresponds to the
conformal superspin- @xmath gauge prepotential reviewed in subsection
5.1.3 . It is natural to interpret @xmath as a compensating multiplet.
In order for @xmath and @xmath to be real, @xmath must be charged under
the @xmath -symmetry group U(1) @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.7.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In addition to ( 5.7.2b ), the compensator @xmath also possesses its own
gauge freedom

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.7.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with the gauge parameter @xmath being covariantly chiral, but otherwise
arbitrary. It should be pointed out that in (1,1) AdS superspace
covariantly chiral superfields exist only in the scalar case, since the
constraint @xmath is inconsistent for @xmath . Therefore, the gauge
transformation law ( 5.7.5 ) is specific for the (2,0) AdS
supersymmetry.

Associated with @xmath is the real field strength

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.7.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which is a covariantly linear superfield,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.7.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It is inert under the gauge transformation ( 5.7.5 ), @xmath . From (
5.7.2b ) we can read off the @xmath -gauge transformation of the field
strength

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.7.8)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

The reason why we express the gauge transformations of @xmath and @xmath
in terms of the constrained superfield @xmath is that such
representation will be useful to carry out the @xmath AdS reduction in
chapter 6 .

Modulo an overall normalisation factor, there is a unique quadratic
action which is invariant under the gauge transformations ( 5.7.2 ). It
is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.7.9)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

By construction, the action is also invariant under ( 5.7.5 ). This
action differs from the massless half-integer superspin actions in (1,1)
AdS superspace, ( 5.3.6 ) and ( 5.3.9 ), due to the presence of a
Chern-Simons-type term.

Setting @xmath in ( 5.7.9 ) gives the linearised action for (2,0) AdS
supergravity, which was originally derived in section 10.1 of [ 83 ] .
Ref. [ 83 ] made use of the curvature parameter @xmath , which is
related to our @xmath as @xmath . It should be remarked that the
structure @xmath in ( 5.7.9 ) is not defined for @xmath . However, this
term contains an overall numerical factor @xmath and therefore it does
not contribute for @xmath .

#### 5.7.2 Type III series

Our second model for the massless multiplet of superspin- @xmath is
realised in terms of dynamical variables that are completely similar to
( 5.7.1 ),

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.7.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Here @xmath and @xmath are unconstrained real tensor superfields.

The dynamical superfields are defined modulo gauge transformations of
the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.7.11a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.7.11b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

where the gauge parameter @xmath is unconstrained complex, and the
longitudinal linear parameter @xmath is defined as in ( 5.7.3 ). As in
the type II case, @xmath is the superconformal gauge multiplet, while
@xmath is a compensating multiplet. The only difference from the type II
case occurs in the gauge transformation law for the compensator @xmath .

The compensator @xmath is required to have its own gauge freedom of the
form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.7.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with the gauge parameter @xmath being covariantly chiral, but otherwise
arbitrary.

Associated with @xmath is the real field strength

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.7.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which is inert under ( 5.7.12 ), @xmath . It is not difficult to see
that @xmath is covariantly linear,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.7.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

It varies under the @xmath -gauge transformation ( 5.7.11 ) as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.7.15)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

Modulo normalisation, there exists a unique action being invariant under
the gauge transformations ( 5.7.11 ) and ( 5.7.12 ). It is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.7.16)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

Although the structure @xmath in ( 5.7.16 ) is not defined for @xmath ,
it comes with the factor @xmath and drops out from ( 5.7.16 ) for the
@xmath case. In this case the action coincides with the type III
supergravity action ⁵ ⁵ 5 Type III supergravity is known only at the
linearised level. In the super-Poincaré case, it is a 3D analogue of the
massless superspin-3/2 multiplet proposed in [ 132 ] . in (2,0) AdS
superspace, which was originally derived in section 10.2 of [ 83 ] .

### 5.8 Summary and discussion

Let us summarise the main results obtained thus far. Sections 5.3 and
5.4 are devoted to the superfield descriptions of off-shell massless
higher-spin gauge theories in (1,1) AdS superspace, which are
essentially analogous to their 4D @xmath AdS counterparts. A useful
application includes the possibility to derive off-shell massless
higher-spin @xmath supermultiplets by performing @xmath superspace
reduction. As an example, we carried out reduction of the longitudinal
theory for the massless superspin- @xmath multiplet ( 5.4.6 ) in the
super-Poincaré limit and ended up with a new model for massless @xmath
higher-spin supermultiplet that was not described in [ 51 , 50 ] . In
section 5.5 , the off-shell gauge formulations enabled us to derive
consistent higher-spin supercurrent multiplets with (1,1) AdS
supersymmetry. By studying models for chiral scalar superfields, we
presented explicit expressions of such supercurrents.

With regards to (2,0) AdS supersymmetry, we employed a “bottom-up”
approach. The starting point was some simple dynamical systems in (2,0)
AdS superspace, i.e models for a free chiral scalar superfield. In such
models, we deduced that the corresponding multiplet of higher-spin
currents is described by the conservation equations

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -- ----------
                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                 @xmath      (5.8.1a)
  with the real superfield @xmath denotes the higher-spin supercurrent, and @xmath the corresponding trace supermultiplet constrained to be covariantly linear               
                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                 @xmath      (5.8.1b)
  In general, the trace supermultiplet is complex,                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                 @xmath      (5.8.1c)
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -- ----------

In the @xmath case, the above conservation equation coincides with that
for the (2,0) AdS supercurrent [ 83 ] .

We did not carry out a systematic analysis (similar to that given by
Dumitrescu and Seiberg [ 79 ] for ordinary supercurrents in Minkowski
space) of the higher-spin supercurrent ( 5.8.1 ). However, the formal
consistency of ( 5.8.1 ) follows from the structure of the massless
superspin- @xmath gauge theories constructed in section 5.7 . For
instance, within the framework of the type II formulation, let us couple
the prepotentials @xmath and @xmath to external sources

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.8.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Requiring @xmath to be invariant under the gauge transformations ( 5.7.5
) tells us that the real supermultiplet @xmath is covariantly linear,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.8.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

If we also require @xmath to be invariant under the gauge
transformations ( 5.7.2 ), we obtain the conservation equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.8.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Additionally, taking the type III formulation into account leads to the
general conservation equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.8.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the real trace supermultiplets @xmath and @xmath are covariantly
linear. The off-shell construction of a massless multiplet of superspin
with (2,0) AdS supersymmetry would definitely deserve further study.

An improvement transformation exists for the higher-spin supercurrent
multiplet ( 5.8.1 ). Let us introduce

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
                                         
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.8.6a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.8.6b)
                                @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.8.6c)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

with @xmath and @xmath real linear superfields. One may check that
@xmath and @xmath obey the conservation equation and constraints
described by ( 5.8.1 ). In the @xmath case, we reproduce the result
given in section 10.4 of [ 83 ] .

As a final remark, there is one special feature of the supergravity
case, @xmath , for which the supercurrent conservation equation takes
the form [ 83 ]

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.8.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with the real trace supermultiplets @xmath and @xmath being covariantly
linear. Building on the thorough analysis of [ 79 ] , it was pointed out
in [ 83 ] that there exists a well-defined improvement transformation
that results with @xmath . For all the supersymmetric field theories in
(2,0) AdS superspace considered in [ 83 ] , the supercurrent is
characterised by the condition @xmath . Actually, this condition is easy
to explain. The point is that every 3D @xmath supersymmetric field
theory with U(1) @xmath -symmetry may be coupled to the (2,0) AdS
supergravity, which implies @xmath upon freezing the supergravity
multiplet to its maximally supersymmetric (2,0) AdS background. There is
another way to explain why @xmath may always be improved to zero. For
simplicity, let us consider the case of @xmath Poincaré supersymmetry,
with @xmath and @xmath being the flat-superspace covariant derivatives.
In Minkowski superspace eq. ( 5.8.7 ) implies @xmath , and therefore
@xmath , for some real linear superfield @xmath . If we now apply the
flat-superspace version of ( 5.8.6 ) with @xmath , we will end up with
@xmath . However, in the higher-spin case it no longer seems possible to
improve the trace supermultiplet @xmath to vanish, as our analysis in
section 5.6 indicates.

## Chapter 6 Field theories with (2,0) AdS supersymmetry in @xmath AdS
superspace

In the preceding chapter, it was pointed out that 3D @xmath -extended
AdS supergravity exists in several incarnations and they are known as
@xmath AdS supergravity theories. Various aspects of @xmath
supersymmetric higher-spin gauge theories in 3D anti-de Sitter space,
@xmath , have also been elaborated in some detail.

This chapter has two main objectives. The first is to present a
formalism which was developed in [ 6 ] to reduce every field theory with
(2,0) AdS supersymmetry to @xmath AdS superspace. This formalism is then
applied to carry out the (2,0) @xmath (1,0) AdS reduction of the two
off-shell massless higher-spin supermultiplets constructed in section
5.7 . Our motivation came from certain theoretical arguments which
suggest the existence of more general off-shell massless higher-spin
@xmath supermultiplets in AdS @xmath than those described in [ 51 ] .
The second objective is to study @xmath supermultiplets of conserved
higher-spin currents in AdS @xmath , which were derived for the first
time in [ 6 ] . ¹ ¹ 1 It should be pointed out that the superconformal
multiplets of conserved currents in Minkowski superspace [ 109 ] can
readily be lifted to AdS @xmath .

### 6.1 (2,0) @xmath (1,0) AdS superspace reduction

The aim of this section is to elaborate on the details of procedure for
reducing field theories in (2,0) AdS superspace to @xmath AdS
superspace. Explicit examples of such a reduction are given by
considering supersymmetric nonlinear @xmath -models.

#### 6.1.1 Geometry of (2,0) AdS superspace: Real basis

In section 5.2.2 the geometry of (2,0) AdS superspace was described in
terms of the complex basis for the spinor covariant derivatives, eq. (
5.2.20 ). It proves to be more convenient to switch to a real basis in
order to carry out reduction to @xmath AdS superspace @xmath . Following
[ 155 ] , such a basis is introduced by replacing the complex operators
@xmath and @xmath with @xmath defined as follows:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In a similar way, we introduce real coordinates, @xmath , to parametrise
(2,0) AdS superspace. Defining @xmath , the algebra of (2,0) AdS
covariant derivatives ( 5.2.20 ) turns into ² ² 2 The antisymmetric
tensors @xmath and @xmath are normalised as @xmath .

  -- -------- -- ----------
                 
     @xmath      (6.1.2a)
     @xmath      (6.1.2b)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The action of the @xmath generator on the spinor covariant derivatives
is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

As may be seen from ( 6.1.2 ), the graded commutation relations for the
operators @xmath and @xmath have the following properties:

1.  These (anti-)commutation relations do not involve @xmath ,

      -- -------- -- ----------
                     
         @xmath      (6.1.4a)
         @xmath      (6.1.4b)
      -- -------- -- ----------

2.  Relations ( 6.1.4 ) are isomorphic to the algebra of the covariant
    derivatives of @xmath , see [ 155 ] for the details.

We thus see that @xmath is naturally embedded in (2,0) AdS superspace as
a subspace. The real Grassmann variables of (2,0) AdS superspace, @xmath
, may be chosen in such a way that @xmath corresponds to the surface
defined by @xmath . We also note that no U @xmath curvature is present
in the algebra of @xmath AdS covariant derivatives. These properties
make possible a consistent @xmath AdS superspace reduction.

Now we will recast the fundamental properties of the (2,0) AdS Killing
supervector fields in the real representation ( 6.1.1 ). The isometries
of (2,0) AdS superspace are described in terms of those first-order
operators

  -------------------------- -------- -- ----------
                                         
                             @xmath      (6.1.5a)
  which solve the equation               
                                         
                             @xmath      (6.1.5b)
  -------------------------- -------- -- ----------

for some real parameters @xmath and @xmath . Equation ( 6.1.5b ) is
equivalent to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.6a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.6b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.6c)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.6d)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

and

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.7a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.7b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.7c)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.7d)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

Some nontrivial implications of the above equations which will be
important for our subsequent consideration are:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.8a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.8b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.8c)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.8d)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

Equation ( 6.1.7a ) implies that @xmath is a Killing vector field,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

while ( 6.1.7b ) is a Killing spinor equation. The real parameter @xmath
is constrained by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

#### 6.1.2 Reduction from (2,0) to (1,0) AdS superspace

Given a tensor superfield @xmath on (2,0) AdS superspace, its @xmath
projection (or bar-projection) is defined by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

in a special coordinate system to be specified below. By definition,
@xmath depends on the real coordinates @xmath , with @xmath , which will
be used to parametrise @xmath AdS superspace @xmath . For the (2,0) AdS
covariant derivative

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

its bar-projection is defined as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We use the freedom to perform general coordinate, local Lorentz and U
@xmath transformations to choose the following gauge condition

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

denotes the set of covariant derivatives for @xmath , which obey the
following graded commutation relations:

  -- -------- -- -----------
                 
     @xmath      (6.1.16a)
     @xmath      (6.1.16b)
  -- -------- -- -----------

In such a coordinate system, the operator @xmath contains no partial
derivative with respect to @xmath . As a consequence, @xmath , for any
positive integer @xmath , where is a tensor superfield on (2,0) AdS
superspace. Let us study how the @xmath descendants of defined by @xmath
transform under the (2,0) AdS isometries, with @xmath a non-negative
integer.

We introduce the @xmath projection of the (2,0) AdS Killing supervector
field ( 6.1.5 )

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We also introduce the @xmath projections of the Lorentz and U @xmath
parameters in ( 6.1.5 ):

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

It follows from ( 6.1.5 ) that the @xmath parameters @xmath and @xmath
obey the equation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which tells us that @xmath is a Killing supervector field of @xmath AdS
superspace [ 155 ] . This equation is equivalent to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.20a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.20b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.20c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

These relations automatically follow from the (2,0) AdS Killing
equations, eqs. ( 6.1.6a ) – ( 6.1.6d ), upon @xmath projection. Thus
@xmath parametrise the infinitesimal isometries of @xmath [ 155 ] (see
also [ 51 ] ).

The remaining parameters @xmath and @xmath generate the second
supersymmetry and @xmath transformations, respectively. Using the
Killing equations ( 6.1.8 ), it can be shown that they satisfy the
following properties

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.21a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.21b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

These imply that the only independent components of @xmath are @xmath
and @xmath . They correspond to the @xmath and second supersymmetry
transformations, respectively.

Given a matter tensor superfield , its (2,0) AdS transformation law

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

turns into

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.23a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.23b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.23c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

It follows from ( 6.1.5 ) and ( 6.1.23 ) that every @xmath descendant
@xmath is a tensor superfield on @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

For the @xmath -transformation we get

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where @xmath is the U @xmath charge of defined by @xmath . In the second
term on the right, we have to push @xmath to the far left through the
@xmath factors of @xmath ’s by making use of the relation @xmath and
taking into account the relation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As the next step, the U @xmath generator @xmath should be pushed to the
right until it hits producing on the way insertions of @xmath . Then the
procedure should be repeated. As a result, the variation @xmath is
expressed in terms of the superfields @xmath .

So far we have been completely general and discussed infinitely many
descendants @xmath of . However only a few of them are functionally
independent. Indeed, eq. ( 6.1.2a ) tells us that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and thus every @xmath for @xmath can be expressed in terms of @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath . Therefore, it suffices to consider @xmath .

Let us give two examples of matter superfields on (2,0) AdS superspace.
We first consider a covariantly chiral scalar superfield @xmath , with
an arbitrary U @xmath charge @xmath defined by @xmath . It transforms
under the (2,0) AdS isometries as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.28)
  -- -------- -- ----------

When expressed in the real basis ( 6.1.1 ), the chirality constraint on
means

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As a result, there is only one independent @xmath superfield upon
reduction,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.30)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We then get the following relations

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.31a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.31b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

The @xmath -transformation ( 6.1.2 ) is given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.32)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Our second example is a real linear superfield @xmath . The real
linearity constraint relates the @xmath descendants of @xmath as
follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.33a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.33b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

Thus, @xmath is equivalent to two independent, real @xmath superfields:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.34)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Here @xmath is unconstrained, while @xmath obeys the constraint (
6.1.33b )

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.35)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which means that @xmath is the field strength of an @xmath vector
multiplet. Since @xmath is neutral under the @xmath -symmetry group U
@xmath , @xmath , the second supersymmetry and U @xmath transformation
laws of the @xmath descendants of @xmath are as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------
                                         
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.1.36a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.1.36b)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------

#### 6.1.3 The (2,0) AdS supersymmetric actions in @xmath

Every rigid supersymmetric field theory in (2,0) AdS superspace may be
reduced to @xmath AdS superspace. Here we provide the key technical
details of the reduction.

In accordance with [ 113 , 168 , 83 , 160 ] , there are two ways of
constructing supersymmetric actions in (2,0) AdS superspace: (i) either
by integrating a real scalar @xmath over the full (2,0) AdS superspace,
³ ³ 3 The component inverse vierbein is defined as usual, @xmath , with
@xmath .

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.37)
              @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

with @xmath ; or (ii) by integrating a covariantly chiral scalar @xmath
over the chiral subspace of the (2,0) AdS superspace,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.38)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with @xmath being the chiral density. The superfield Lagrangians @xmath
and @xmath are neutral and charged, respectively with respect to the
group @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.39)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The two types of supersymmetric actions are related to each other by the
rule

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.40)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Instead of reducing the above actions to components, in this paper we
need their reduction to @xmath AdS superspace. We remind the reader that
the supersymmetric action in @xmath makes use of a real scalar
Lagrangian @xmath . The superspace and component forms of the action
are:

  -- -- -- ----------
           (6.1.41)
  -- -- -- ----------

For the action ( 6.1.37 ) we get

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.42)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with @xmath . The chiral action ( 6.1.38 ) reduces to (1,0) AdS as
follows:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.43)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Making use of the (2,0) AdS transformation law @xmath , @xmath , and the
Killing equation ( 6.1.5b ), it can be checked explicitly that the
@xmath action defined by the right-hand side of ( 6.1.42 ), or ( 6.1.43
) are invariant under the (2,0) AdS isometry transformations.

#### 6.1.4 Supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models

To illustrate the @xmath AdS superspace reduction described above, here
we discuss two interesting examples.

Our first example is a general nonlinear @xmath -model with (2,0) AdS
supersymmetry [ 168 , 83 ] . It is described by the action

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.44)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the Kähler potential of a Kähler manifold and @xmath is
a superpotential. The U @xmath generator is realised on the dynamical
superfields @xmath and @xmath as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.45)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is a holomorphic Killing vector field such that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.46)
  -- -------- -- ----------

for some Killing potential @xmath . The superpotential has to obey the
condition

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.47)
  -- -------- -- ----------

in order for the action ( 6.1.44 ) to be invariant under the (2,0) AdS
isometry transformations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.48)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In the real representation ( 6.1.1 ), the chirality condition on @xmath
turns into

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.49)
  -- -------- -- ----------

It follows that upon @xmath reduction, @xmath leads to just one
superfield,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.50)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In particular, we have the following relations

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.51a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.51b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

Using the reduction rules ( 6.1.42 ) and ( 6.1.43 ), we obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1.52)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

where we have made use of the standard notation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.53)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The action ( 6.1.52 ) is manifestly @xmath supersymmetric. One may
explicitly check that it is also invariant under the second
supersymmetry and @xmath -symmetry transformations generated by a real
scalar parameter @xmath subject to the constraints ( 6.1.21 ), which
are:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.54)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The family of supersymmetric @xmath -models ( 6.1.44 ) includes a
special subclass which is specified by the two conditions: (ii) all
@xmath ’s are neutral, @xmath ; and (ii) no superpotential is present,
@xmath . In this case no restriction on the Kähler potential is imposed
by eq. ( 6.1.46 ), and the action ( 6.1.44 ) is invariant under
arbitrary Kähler transformations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.55)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with @xmath a holomorphic function. The corresponding action in @xmath
AdS superspace is obtained from ( 6.1.52 ) by setting @xmath and @xmath
, and thus the action is manifestly Kähler invariant.

Let us also consider a supersymmetric nonlinear @xmath -model formulated
in terms of several Abelian vector multiplets with action [ 83 ]

  -- -- -- ----------
           (6.1.56)
  -- -- -- ----------

where @xmath is a real analytic function of several variables, which is
defined modulo linear inhomogeneous shifts

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.57)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with real parameters @xmath and @xmath . The real linear scalar @xmath
is the field strength of a vector multiplet. Upon reduction to @xmath
AdS superspace, @xmath generates two different @xmath superfields:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.58)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Here the real scalar @xmath is unconstrained, while the real spinor
@xmath obeys the constraint

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.59)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which means that @xmath is the field strength of an @xmath vector
multiplet. Reducing the action ( 6.1.56 ) to @xmath AdS superspace gives

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.60)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where we have introduced the target-space metric

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.61)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The vector multiplets in ( 6.1.60 ) can be dualised into scalar ones,
which gives

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.1.62)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with @xmath being the inverse metric.

### 6.2 Massless higher-spin models: Type II series

In accordance with section 5.7 , there exist two off-shell formulations
for a massless multiplet of half-integer superspin- @xmath in (2,0) AdS
superspace, with @xmath which are called the type II and type III
series. In this section we describe the @xmath AdS superspace reduction
of the type II theory. The reduction of the type III theory will be
given in section 6.3 .

#### 6.2.1 Reduction of the gauge prepotentials to @xmath

Let us turn to reducing the gauge prepotentials ( 5.7.1 ) to @xmath AdS
superspace. ⁴ ⁴ 4 In the super-Poincaré case, the @xmath reduction of
@xmath has been carried out in [ 50 ] . Our first task is to work out
such a reduction for the superconformal gauge multiplet @xmath . In the
real representation ( 6.1.1 ), the longitudinal linear constraint (
5.7.3 ) takes the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It follows that @xmath has two independent @xmath -components, which are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The gauge transformation of @xmath , eq. ( 5.7.2a ), allows us to choose
two gauge conditions

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In this gauge we stay with the following unconstrained real @xmath
superfields:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.4a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.4b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

There exists a residual gauge freedom which preserves the gauge
conditions ( 6.2.3 ). It is described by unconstrained real @xmath
superfields @xmath and @xmath defined by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.5a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.5b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The gauge transformation laws of the superfields ( 6.2.4 ) are given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.6a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.6b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

Our next step is to reduce the compensator @xmath to @xmath AdS
superspace. Making use of the representation ( 6.1.1 ), we observe that
the chirality condition ( 5.7.5 ) reads

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The gauge transformation ( 5.7.5 ) allows us to impose a gauge condition

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Thus, upon reduction to @xmath superspace, we have the following real
superfields

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.9a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.9b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

Here @xmath is a reducible superfield which belongs to the
representation @xmath of @xmath , @xmath . The condition ( 6.2.8 ) is
preserved by the residual gauge freedom generated by a real
unconstrained @xmath superfield @xmath defined by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We may now determine how the @xmath -transformation acts on the
superfields ( 6.2.9a ) and ( 6.2.9b ). We obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.11a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.11b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

where we have used the chirality constraint ( 6.2.7 ) and the expression
( 6.2.10 ) for the residual gauge transformation.

Next, we analyse the @xmath -gauge transformation and reduce the @xmath
field strength @xmath to @xmath . In the real basis for the covariant
derivatives, the real linearity constraint ( 5.7.7 ) is equivalent to
two constraints:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.12a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.12b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

These constraints imply that the resulting @xmath components of @xmath
are given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

of which the former is unconstrained and the latter is a constrained
@xmath superfield that proves to be a gauge-invariant field strength, as
we shall see below. The relation between @xmath and the prepotential
@xmath is given by ( 5.7.6 ), which can be expressed as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We now compute the bar-projection of ( 6.2.14 ) in the gauge ( 6.2.8 )
and make use of the definition ( 6.2.9b ) to obtain

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Making use of ( 6.2.14 ) and ( 6.2.9a ), the bar-projection of @xmath
leads to the @xmath field strength

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.16)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

Here @xmath is a real superfield, @xmath , and is a descendant of the
real unconstrained prepotential @xmath defined modulo gauge
transformation ( 6.2.11a ). The field strength proves to be gauge
invariant under ( 6.2.11a ). It also obeys

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

as a consequence of ( 6.2.12b ) and the identity ( A.2.12b ). Let us
express the gauge transformation of @xmath , eq. ( 5.7.8 ) in terms of
the real basis for the covariant derivatives,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.2.18)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

In a similar way, one should also rewrite @xmath in the real basis. This
allows us to derive the gauge transformations for @xmath and @xmath

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                                                                                          
                                                                            @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.19a)
                                                                            @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.19b)
  We can then read off the transformation law for the prepotential @xmath                                 
                                                                                                          
                                                                            @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.19c)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

where we have also taken into account the @xmath -gauge freedom (
6.2.11a ).

Applying the @xmath reduction rule ( 6.1.42 ) to the type II action (
5.7.9 ) and using the commutation relation

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.2.20)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

we find that ( 5.7.9 ) becomes a sum of two actions,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Explicit expressions for these @xmath actions will be given in the next
subsection.

#### 6.2.2 Massless higher-spin @xmath supermultiplets in AdS@xmath

The gauge transformations ( 6.2.6a ), ( 6.2.6b ), ( 6.2.19a ) and (
6.2.19c ) tell us that in fact we are dealing with two different @xmath
supersymmetric higher-spin gauge theories.

Given a positive integer @xmath , we say that a supersymmetric gauge
theory describes a multiplet of superspin @xmath if it is formulated in
terms of a superconformal gauge prepotential @xmath and possibly a
compensating multiplet. The gauge freedom of the real tensor superfield
@xmath is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with the gauge parameter @xmath being real but otherwise unconstrained.

##### 6.2.2.1 Longitudinal formulation for massless superspin-@xmath
multiplet

One of the two @xmath theories provides an off-shell formulation for the
massless superspin- @xmath multiplet. It is formulated in terms of the
real unconstrained gauge superfields

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which are defined modulo gauge transformations

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.24a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.24b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

where the parameter @xmath is unconstrained real. The gauge-invariant
action is

  -- -------- -- -- -------- ----------
     @xmath                  (6.2.25)
                             
                    @xmath   
                    @xmath   
                    @xmath   
                    @xmath   
  -- -------- -- -- -------- ----------

where @xmath is the quadratic Casimir operator of the 3D @xmath AdS
supergroup, see eq. ( A.2.14 ). The action ( 6.2.25 ) coincides with the
off-shell @xmath supersymmetric action for massless half-integer
superspin in @xmath in the form given in [ 51 ] . Its flat-superspace
limit was presented earlier in [ 50 ] . In what follows, we will refer
to the above theory as the longitudinal formulation for the massless
superspin- @xmath multiplet.

The structure @xmath in ( 6.2.25 ) is not defined for @xmath . However
it comes with the factor @xmath and drops out from ( 6.2.25 ) for @xmath
. The resulting action

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

is the linearised action for @xmath AdS supergravity. In the flat
superspace limit, the action is equivalent to the one given in [ 56 ] .

##### 6.2.2.2 Transverse formulation for massless superspin-@xmath
multiplet

The other @xmath theory provides a formulation for the massless
superspin- @xmath multiplet. It is described by the unconstrained real
superfields

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which are defined modulo gauge transformations of the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.28a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.28b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

where the gauge parameters @xmath and @xmath are unconstrained real. The
gauge-invariant action is given by

  ----------------------------------------- -------- -- -- -------- -----------
                                                                    
                                            @xmath                  (6.2.29a)
                                                                    
                                                           @xmath   
                                                           @xmath   
                                                           @xmath   
  where @xmath denotes the field strength                           
                                                                    
                                            @xmath                  (6.2.29b)
  ----------------------------------------- -------- -- -- -------- -----------

The action ( 6.2.29 ) defines a new @xmath supersymmetric higher-spin
theory which was not present in [ 51 , 4 , 50 ] even in the
super-Poincaré case.

The structure @xmath in ( 6.2.29a ) is not defined for @xmath . However
it comes with the factor @xmath and drops out from ( 6.2.29a ) for
@xmath . The resulting gauge-invariant action

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.2.30)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

provides an off-shell realisation for a massless gravitino multiplet in
AdS @xmath . In the flat-superspace limit, this model reduces to the one
described in [ 50 ] .

In the @xmath case, the gauge freedom of the prepotential @xmath (
6.2.28 ) allows us to impose a gauge condition

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.31)
  -- -------- -- ----------

for some field @xmath . Since we gauge away the symmetric part of @xmath
, the two gauge parameters @xmath and @xmath are related. The theory is
now realised in terms of the following dynamical variables

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.32)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with the gauge freedom

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.33a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.2.33b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

It follows that in the flat superspace limit, @xmath , and in the gauge
( 6.2.31 ), the action ( 6.2.29 ) reduces to ( 5.4.51 ). The component
structure of this model will be discussed in appendix C.1 .

### 6.3 Massless higher-spin models: Type III series

In this section we carry out the @xmath AdS superspace reduction of the
type III theory ( 5.7.16 ) following the procedure employed in section
6.2 .

#### 6.3.1 Reduction of the gauge prepotentials to @xmath

The reduction of the superconformal gauge multiplet @xmath to @xmath has
been carried out in the previous section. We saw that in the gauge (
6.2.3 ), @xmath is described by the two unconstrained real superfields
@xmath and @xmath defined according to ( 6.2.4 ), with their gauge
transformation laws given by eqs. ( 6.2.6a ) and ( 6.2.6b ),
respectively. Now it remains to reduce the prepotential @xmath to @xmath
AdS superspace, following the same approach as outlined in the type II
series. The gauge transformation ( 5.7.12 ) allows us to choose a gauge
condition

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The compensator @xmath is then equivalent to the following real @xmath
superfields, which we define as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath               (6.3.2a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.3.2b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The residual gauge freedom, which preserves the gauge condition ( 6.3.1
) is described by a real unconstrained @xmath superfield @xmath defined
by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

As a result, we may determine how ( 6.3.2a ) and ( 6.3.2b ) vary under
@xmath -transformation

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.3.4a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.3.4b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

Next, we analyse the @xmath -gauge transformation and reduce the field
strength @xmath to @xmath . In the real basis for the covariant
derivatives, the real linearity constraint ( 5.7.14 ) turns into:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.3.5a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.3.5b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

This tells us that @xmath is equivalent to two real @xmath superfields

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The relation between the field strength @xmath and the prepotential
@xmath is given by ( 5.7.13 ), which can be expressed as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We now compute the bar-projection of ( 6.3.7 ) in the gauge ( 6.3.1 )
and make use of the definition ( 6.3.2b ) to obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The bar-projection of @xmath leads to the @xmath field-strength

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.3.9)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

which is a real superfield, @xmath , and is a descendant of the real
unconstrained prepotential @xmath defined modulo gauge transformation (
6.3.4a ). One may check that the field strength is invariant under (
6.3.4a ) and obeys the condition

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Let us express the gauge transformation of @xmath , eq. ( 5.7.15 ) in
terms of the real basis for the covariant derivatives. This leads to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.3.11)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

One should also express its corollary @xmath in the real basis for the
covariant derivatives. We determine the gauge transformations law for
@xmath and @xmath to be

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.3.12a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.3.12b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

From ( 6.3.12b ) we read off the transformation law for the prepotential
@xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.3.13)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

where we have also taken into account the @xmath -gauge freedom ( 6.3.4a
).

Performing @xmath reduction to the original type III action ( 5.7.16 ),
we arrive at two decoupled @xmath actions

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We will present the exact form of these actions in the next subsection.

#### 6.3.2 Massless higher-spin @xmath supermultiplets in AdS@xmath

Upon reduction to @xmath superspace, the type III theory leads to two
@xmath supersymmetric gauge theories.

##### 6.3.2.1 Longitudinal formulation for massless superspin-@xmath
multiplet

One of the two @xmath theories provides an off-shell realisation for
massless superspin- @xmath multiplet described in terms of the real
unconstrained superfields

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which are defined modulo gauge transformations of the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.3.16a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.3.16b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

where the gauge parameter @xmath is unconstrained real. The
gauge-invariant action is given by

  -- -------- -- -------- --
     @xmath               
                          
                 @xmath   
                 @xmath   
  -- -------- -- -------- --

Modulo an overall normalisation factor, ( 6.3.2.1 ) coincides with the
off-shell @xmath supersymmetric action for massless superspin- @xmath
multiplet in the form given in [ 51 ] . In the flat superspace limit it
reduces to the action derived in [ 50 ] .

Although the structure @xmath in ( 6.3.2.1 ) is not defined for @xmath ,
it comes with the factor @xmath and thus drops out from ( 6.3.2.1 ) for
@xmath . The resulting gauge-invariant action

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.3.18)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

describes an off-shell massless gravitino multiplet in AdS @xmath . In
the flat superspace limit, it reduces to the gravitino multiplet model
described in [ 133 ] (see also [ 50 ] ).

##### 6.3.2.2 Transverse formulation for massless superspin-@xmath
multiplet

The other theory provides an off-shell formulation for massless
superspin- @xmath multiplet. It is described by the unconstrained
superfields

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which are defined modulo gauge transformations of the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.3.20a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.3.20b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

The gauge-invariant action is

  ---------------------------------------------- -------- -- -----------
                                                             
                                                             
                                                 @xmath      
                                                 @xmath      
                                                 @xmath      
                                                 @xmath      
                                                 @xmath      (6.3.21a)
  where @xmath denotes the real field strength               
                                                             
                                                 @xmath      (6.3.21b)
  ---------------------------------------------- -------- -- -----------

This action defines a new @xmath supersymmetric higher-spin theory which
did not appear in [ 4 , 50 , 51 ] .

The structure @xmath in ( 6.3.21a ) is not defined for @xmath . However
it comes with the factor @xmath and hence drops out from ( 6.3.21a ) for
@xmath . The resulting gauge-invariant action

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.3.22)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

provides an off-shell formulation for a linearised supergravity
multiplet in AdS @xmath . In the flat superspace limit, it reduces to
the linearised supergravity model proposed in [ 50 ] .

### 6.4 Analysis of the results

Let @xmath be a positive integer. For each superspin value, integer
@xmath or half-integer @xmath , we have constructed two off-shell
formulations which have been called longitudinal and transverse. Now we
have to explain this terminology.

Consider a field theory in @xmath AdS superspace that is described in
terms of a real tensor superfield @xmath . We assume the action to have
the form

  -- -- -- ---------
           (6.4.1)
  -- -- -- ---------

It is natural to call @xmath a longitudinal superfield, by analogy with
a longitudinal vector field. This theory possesses a dual formulation
that is obtained by introducing a first-order action

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.4.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is unconstrained and the Lagrange multiplier is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.4.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for some unconstrained prepotential @xmath . Varying ( 6.4.2 ) with
respect to @xmath gives

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.4.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and then @xmath reduces to the original action ( 6.4.1 ). On the other
hand, we may start from @xmath and integrate @xmath out. This will lead
to a dual action of the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.4.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This is a gauge theory since the action is invariant under gauge
transformations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.4.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The gauge-invariant field strength @xmath can be called a transverse
superfield, due to the constraint ( 6.4.3 ) it obeys. It is natural to
call the dual formulations ( 6.4.1 ) and ( 6.4.5 ) as longitudinal and
transverse, respectively.

Now, let us consider the transverse and longitudinal formulations for
the massless superspin- @xmath models, which are given by eqs. ( 6.2.29
) and ( 6.3.2.1 ), respectively. These actions depend parametrically on
@xmath , the curvature of AdS superspace. We denote by @xmath and @xmath
these actions in the limit @xmath , which corresponds to a
flat-superspace. The dynamical systems @xmath and @xmath prove to be
related to each other by the Legendre transformation described above.
Thus @xmath and @xmath are dual formulations of the same theory. This
duality does not survive if @xmath is non-vanishing.

The same feature characterises the longitudinal and transverse
formulations for the massless superspin- @xmath multiplet, which are
described by the actions ( 6.2.25 ) and ( 6.3.21 ), respectively. The
flat-superspace counterparts of these higher-spin models, which we
denote by @xmath and @xmath , are dual to each other. However, this
duality does not survive if we turn on a non-vanishing AdS curvature.

### 6.5 Non-conformal higher-spin supercurrents

In the previous sections, we have shown that there exist two different
off-shell formulations for the massless higher-spin @xmath
supermultiplets. Massless half-integer superspin theory can be realised
in terms of the dynamical variables ( 6.2.23 ) and ( 6.3.19 ), while the
models ( 6.2.27 ) and ( 6.3.15 ) define massless multiplet of integer
superspin @xmath , with @xmath . These models lead to different @xmath
higher-spin supercurrent multiplets. Our aim in this section is to
describe the general structure of @xmath supercurrent multiplets in AdS.

#### 6.5.1 @xmath supercurrents: Half-integer superspin case

Our half-integer supermultiplet in the longitudinal formulation ( 6.2.23
) can be coupled to external sources

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.5.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The condition that the above action is invariant under the gauge
transformations ( 6.2.24 ) gives the conservation equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.5.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

For the transverse theory ( 6.3.19 ) described by the prepotentials
@xmath , we construct an action functional of the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.5.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Requiring that the action is invariant under the gauge transformations (
6.3.20 ) leads to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.5.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

From the above consideration, it follows that the most general
conservation equation in the half-integer superspin case takes the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.5.5a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.5.5b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

#### 6.5.2 @xmath supercurrents: Integer superspin case

In complete analogy with the half-integer superspin case, we couple the
prepotentials ( 6.3.15 ) in terms of which the integer superspin- @xmath
is described, to external sources

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.5.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

For such an action to be invariant under the gauge freedom ( 6.3.16 ),
the sources must be conserved

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.5.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Next, we turn to the transverse formulation ( 6.2.27 ) characterised by
the prepotentials @xmath and construct an action functional

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.5.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Demanding that the action be invariant under the gauge transformations (
6.2.28 ), we derive the following conditions

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.5.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

From the above consideration, the most general conservation equation for
the multiplet of currents in the integer superspin case is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.5.10a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.5.10b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

#### 6.5.3 From @xmath supercurrents to @xmath supercurrents

In the previous chapter (see section 5.6 ), we formulated the general
conservation equation for the @xmath higher-spin supercurrent multiplets
in (2,0) AdS superspace, which takes the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.5.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Here @xmath denotes the higher-spin supercurrent, while the trace
supermultiplets @xmath and @xmath are both real and covariantly linear
superfields,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.5.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The explicit form of this multiplet of currents was presented by
considering simple @xmath supersymmetric models for a chiral scalar
superfield. Unlike in 4D @xmath supergravity where every supersymmetric
matter theory can be coupled to only one of the off-shell supergravity
formulations (either old-minimal or new-minimal), here in the (2,0) AdS
case our trace multiplets require both type II and type III compensators
to couple to.

The general conservation equation ( 6.5.11 ) naturally gives rise to the
@xmath higher-spin supercurrent multiplets discussed in the previous
subsection. One may show that in the real basis, ( 6.5.11 ) turns into:

  -- -------- -------- -- -- -----------
                             
     @xmath   @xmath         (6.5.13a)
     @xmath   @xmath         (6.5.13b)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- -----------

The real linearity constraints on the trace supermultiplets, eq. (
6.5.12 ), are equivalent to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.5.14a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.5.14b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

It follows from ( 6.5.13 ) and ( 6.5.14 ) that @xmath contains two
independent real @xmath supermultiplets:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.5.15a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.5.15b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

while the independent real @xmath components of @xmath and @xmath are
defined by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.5.16a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.5.16b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

Making use of ( 6.5.14 ), one may readily show that

  -- -------- -- -----------
                 
     @xmath      (6.5.17a)
     @xmath      (6.5.17b)
  -- -------- -- -----------

On the other hand, eq. ( 6.5.13 ) implies that the @xmath superfields
obey the following conditions

  -- -------- -- -----------
                 
     @xmath      (6.5.18a)
     @xmath      (6.5.18b)
  -- -------- -- -----------

Indeed, the right-hand side of eq. ( 6.5.18a ) coincides with ( 6.5.5a
). Therefore, eqs. ( 6.5.17a ) and ( 6.5.18a ) define the @xmath
higher-spin current multiplets associated with the massless half-integer
superspin formulations ( 6.2.23 ) and ( 6.3.19 ). In a similar way, it
can be observed that eqs. ( 6.5.17b ) and ( 6.5.18b ) correspond to the
@xmath higher-spin supercurrents for the two integer superspin models (
6.2.27 ) and ( 6.3.15 ).

### 6.6 Examples of @xmath higher-spin supercurrents

In this section we give an explicit realisation of the @xmath multiplet
of higher-spin supercurrent introduced earlier.

We recall the action ( 5.6.1 ) for a massless chiral scalar in (2,0) AdS
superspace

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.6.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The chiral superfield is charged under the @xmath -symmetry group @xmath
,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.6.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This action is a special case of the supersymmetric nonlinear sigma
model studied in subsection ( 6.1.3 ) with a vanishing superpotential,
@xmath . Making use of ( 6.1.52 ), the reduction of the action ( 6.6.1 )
to @xmath AdS superspace is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.6.3)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

where we have denoted @xmath . This action is manifestly @xmath
supersymmetric. It also possesses hidden second supersymmetry and @xmath
invariance. These transformations are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.6.4)

where @xmath is given in terms or @xmath according to ( 6.1.21a ), and
the real parameter @xmath is constrained by ( 6.1.21b ). It can be seen
that @xmath and @xmath obey the equations of motion

Making use of our condensed notation, we may define the operators

It was shown in section 5.6 that by using the massless equation of
motion, @xmath , the @xmath higher-spin supercurrent multiplet
associated with the theory ( 6.6.1 ) is described by the conservation
equation

  -------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------
                                                                                         
                                                     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.6.10a)
  Here the real supercurrent @xmath is given by                                          
                                                                                         
                                                     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.6.10b)
  while the trace multiplet @xmath has the form                                          
                                                                                         
                                                     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.6.10c)
                                                                                @xmath   
  One may check that @xmath is covariantly linear,                                       
                                                                                         
                                                     @xmath                              (6.6.10d)
  -------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------

As is seen from ( 6.6.10c ), @xmath vanishes for @xmath , in which case
@xmath is an @xmath superconformal multiplet.

The complex trace multiplet @xmath may be split into its real and
imaginary parts:

  ------ -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------
                                             
         @xmath                              (6.6.11a)
  with                                       
                                             
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.6.11b)
                                    @xmath   
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.6.11c)
                                    @xmath   
  ------ -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------

In accordance with ( 6.5.15 ), the supercurrent @xmath reduces to two
different multiplets upon projection to @xmath superspace:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------
                                         
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.6.12a)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.6.12b)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------

of which the former corresponds to the integer superspin current and the
latter half-integer superspin current.

In the case of half-integer superspin, the conservation equation ( 6.5.5
) is satisfied provided we impose ( 6.6.5 ):

  ------ -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------
                                             
         @xmath                              (6.6.13a)
  with                                       
                                             
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.6.13b)
                           @xmath   @xmath   
                                    @xmath   
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.6.13c)
                           @xmath   @xmath   
                                    @xmath   
                                    @xmath   
                                    @xmath   
  ------ -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------

It may also be verified that the @xmath supercurrent multiplet for
integer superspin obeys the conditions ( 6.5.10 ) on-shell:

  ------ -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------
                                             
         @xmath                              (6.6.14a)
  with                                       
                                             
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.6.14b)
                                    @xmath   
                                    @xmath   
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.6.14c)
                           @xmath   @xmath   
                                    @xmath   
                                    @xmath   
                                    @xmath   
  ------ -------- -------- -------- -------- -----------

The above technique can also be used to construct @xmath higher-spin
supercurrents for the Abelian vector multiplets model described by the
action ( 6.1.56 ). We will not elaborate on such a construction here.

### 6.7 Applications and open problems

Let us briefly summarise the results obtained in this chapter. In
section 6.1 , a formalism to reduce every field theory with (2,0) AdS
supersymmetry to @xmath AdS superspace was developed. As nontrivial
examples, we considered supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models formulated
in terms of @xmath chiral and linear supermultiplets. In sections 6.2
and 6.3 , we applied the reduction technique and presented the @xmath
superfield descriptions of the off-shell massless higher-spin
supermultiplets with (2,0) AdS supersymmetry, which were constructed in
chapter 5 . For each superspin value @xmath , integer ( @xmath ) or
half-integer @xmath , with @xmath , the reduction produced two off-shell
gauge formulations (called longitudinal and transverse) for a massless
@xmath superspin- @xmath multiplet in AdS @xmath . The transverse
formulations are new gauge theories. In section 6.4 , we proved that for
each superspin value the longitudinal and transverse theories are dually
equivalent only in the flat superspace limit. In section 6.5 we
formulated the non-conformal higher-spin @xmath supercurrent in @xmath .
In section 6.6 we provided the explicit examples of these supercurrents
in simple models of a chiral scalar superfield.

There are several interesting applications of the results presented in
this chapter. In particular, the massless higher-spin @xmath
supermultiplets in AdS @xmath , which were derived in sections 6.2 and
6.3 , can be used to construct new topologically massive higher-spin
off-shell supermultiplets in AdS @xmath by extending the approaches
advocated in [ 49 , 50 , 51 ] . Such a massive supermultiplet is
described by a gauge-invariant action being the sum of massless and
superconformal higher-spin actions. ⁵ ⁵ 5 We will not review such a
construction in this thesis, see [ 6 ] for details. This procedure
follows the philosophy of topologically massive theories [ 133 , 170 ,
162 , 163 ] .

We now present two off-shell formulations for the massive @xmath
gravitino supermultiplet in AdS @xmath and analyse the corresponding
equations of motion. ⁶ ⁶ 6 The construction of the models ( 6.7.1 ) and
( 6.7.10 ) is similar to those used to derive the off-shell formulations
for massive superspin-1 and superspin-3/2 multiplets in four dimensions
[ 171 , 172 , 173 , 174 , 175 , 176 , 177 , 178 , 179 , 180 , 181 ] .
The massive extension of the longitudinal theory ( 6.3.18 ) is described
by the action

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.7.1)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

with @xmath a real mass parameter. The massive gravitino action is thus
constructed from the massless one by adding mass-like terms. In the
limit @xmath , the action reduces to ( 6.3.18 ). The equations of motion
for the dynamical superfields @xmath and @xmath are

  -- -------- -- ----------
                 
     @xmath      (6.7.2a)
     @xmath      (6.7.2b)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Multiplying ( 6.7.2a ) by @xmath and noting that @xmath yields

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.7.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Substituting ( 6.7.2b ) into ( 6.7.3 ) leads to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.7.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Now that @xmath on-shell, eq. ( 6.7.2b ) turns into

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.7.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

while ( 6.7.2a ) can equivalently be written as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.7.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Making use of the identity ( A.2.12b ), it immediately follows from (
6.7.6 ) that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.7.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and then ( 6.7.6 ) is equivalent to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.7.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Therefore, we have demonstrated that the model ( 6.7.1 ) leads to the
following conditions on the mass shell:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.7.9a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.7.9b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.7.9c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

Such conditions are required to describe an irreducible on-shell massive
gravitino multiplet in 3D @xmath AdS superspace [ 182 ] .

In the transverse formulation ( 6.2.30 ), the action for a massive
gravitino multiplet is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.7.10)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

In the limit @xmath , the action reduces to ( 6.2.30 ). One may check
that the equations of motion for this model imply that

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.7.11a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.7.11b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.7.11c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

The actions ( 6.7.1 ) and ( 6.7.10 ) can be made into gauge-invariant
ones using the Stueckelberg construction.

In the Minkowski superspace limit, the massive models ( 6.7.1 ) and (
6.7.10 ) lead to the identical equations of motion described in terms of
@xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.7.12)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

In the AdS case, the equations ( 6.7.9 ) and ( 6.7.11 ) lead to
equivalent dynamics modulo a redefinition of @xmath . It is an
interesting open problem to understand whether there exists a duality
transformation relating these models.

It should be pointed out that there also exists an on-shell construction
of gauge-invariant Lagrangian formulations for massive higher-spin
supermultiplets in 3D Minkowski and AdS spaces, which were developed in
[ 183 , 184 ] . It is obtained by combining the massive bosonic and
fermionic higher-spin actions [ 185 , 186 ] , and therefore this
construction is intrinsically on-shell. The formulations given in [ 185
, 186 , 183 , 184 ] are based on the gauge-invariant approaches to the
dynamics of massive higher-spin fields, which were advocated by Zinoviev
[ 47 ] and Metsaev [ 187 ] . It is an interesting open problem to
understand whether there exists an off-shell uplift of these models.

## Chapter 7 Conclusion

Over the course of this thesis, we have presented various non-conformal
higher-spin supercurrents and their associated off-shell massless
higher-spin supermultiplets in three and four spacetime dimensions. All
of our analyses were performed using the superspace approach, which is
an efficient means of formulating supercurrent multiplets and off-shell
supersymmetric theories. In four dimensions, a major part of this work
was devoted to the explicit construction of conserved higher-spin
currents with @xmath Poincaré and AdS supersymmetry. In three
dimensions, we studied both the @xmath and @xmath AdS cases. A number of
avenues which could be explored for future studies have been highlighted
at the end of each chapter. Here we summarise the key results of this
thesis and discuss their implications.

Higher-spin supercurrents in 4D @xmath Minkowski and AdS superspaces [ 1
, 2 , 3 ] were studied in chapter 3 and 4 , respectively. The main
ingredients in deriving the supercurrents are the known off-shell
massless higher-spin supermultiplets [ 64 , 65 , 63 ] and their gauge
symmetries. We also formulated the higher-spin supercurrent multiplet
associated with the new off-shell model for the massless integer
superspin. Having understood the structure of the current multiplets and
their improvement transformations, we obtained closed-form expressions
of conserved supercurrents for various supersymmetric theories in AdS.
For instance, a model with @xmath massive chiral scalar superfields with
an arbitrary mass matrix, and the free theories of tensor and complex
linear superfields. For the latter cases, we employed the complex
linear-chiral and the minimal scalar-tensor dualities. The structure of
the conserved supercurrents is determined by the type (integer or
half-integer) and value (even or odd) of the superspin, as well as the
mass matrix. This has been summarised in section 4.6 .

A natural extension of the analysis presented in chapters 3 and 4 would
be to construct 4D @xmath higher-spin supercurrents, by making use of
the known off-shell gauge supermultiplets [ 67 ] .

In regards to the off-shell massless higher-spin @xmath supermultiplets
in 4D Minkowski and AdS backgrounds, we also developed a new off-shell
formulation for the massless integer superspin multiplet. It was shown
that the gauge-invariant action generalises that of the longitudinal
theory. It is described in terms of the complex superconformal
higher-spin prepotential @xmath , in conjunction with two compensating
superfields. Making use of the superfield Legendre transformation, we
constructed its dual action and demonstrated that it reduces to the
transverse formulation.

Chapter 5 discussed @xmath supersymmetric higher-spin gauge theories in
@xmath based on the results of [ 4 , 5 ] . Along the same lines, we
generalised the 4D gauge principles used in chapter 4 to construct
off-shell linearised actions for massless higher-spin supermultiplets
around the (1,1) AdS background. In addition, we derived the
corresponding consistent supercurrents and gave their explicit
expressions for models of chiral superfields. Within the framework of
(2,0) AdS supersymmetry, the problem of constructing off-shell massless
higher-spin gauge supermultiplets has not been fully resolved. In
section 5.6 , we identified a multiplet of conserved higher-spin
currents, which allowed us to construct two off-shell actions for the
massless half-integer superspin multiplet. In each of the formulations,
the corresponding gauge-invariant action contains a higher-spin
extension of a Chern-Simons term. In the limit of @xmath , these actions
reduce to the linearised actions for (2,0) AdS supergravity [ 83 ] . It
remains an open problem to construct an off-shell formulation for a
massless integer superspin multiplet. For completeness, it would be
useful to study the component actions of ( 5.7.9 ) and ( 5.7.16 ) in
order to understand their actual differences with the (1,1) AdS actions.

In chapter 6 we derived four series of off-shell massless higher-spin
@xmath supermultiplets in @xmath , two of which were new supersymmetric
gauge theories. This was accomplished via the @xmath AdS superspace
reduction procedure [ 6 ] . Further analysis showed that these off-shell
models are related by a superfield Legendre transformation in the flat
superspace limit, but the duality is not lifted to the AdS case. The
massless @xmath supersymmetric higher-spin actions in @xmath were used
to formulate (i) conserved @xmath higher-spin supercurrents; and (ii)
two new off-shell massive @xmath gravitino supermultiplets in @xmath .
Additionally, we elaborated on the component structure of the two new
@xmath supersymmetric higher-spin models ( 6.2.29 ) and ( 6.3.21 ) in
flat superspace (see appendix C ). Whilst it was shown that the action (
6.2.29 ) reduces to the 3D (Fang-)Fronsdal actions upon elimination of
the auxiliary fields, an interesting feature appeared in the analysis of
( 6.3.21 ). At the component level, the corresponding multiplet is a 3D
counterpart of the so-called (reducible) higher-spin triplet systems. In
@xmath an action for higher-spin triplets was constructed in [ 188 ] and
[ 189 , 190 ] , for the bosonic and fermionic cases, respectively. This
demonstrates that our superfield construction provides a manifestly
supersymmetric generalisation of these systems.

All supersymmetric higher-spin models presented in this thesis are
linearised actions for higher-spin multiplets. We believe that they can
be used to construct interacting theories, which will allow us to make
contact with the 3D gauge theories developed by Vasiliev and
collaborators [ 191 , 192 , 193 ] . As a next step towards complete
superfield formulation for higher-spin supergravity, an important
problem is to go beyond the linearised approximation, i.e. finding the
relevant deformations of superfield higher-spin actions, gauge
transformations and their corresponding supercurrents.

It would be of particular interest to examine the off-shell structure of
supersymmetric higher-spin multiplets and their associated conserved
supercurrents in 3D with @xmath supersymmetry. It is also expected that
new techniques are required. For example, in order to study the @xmath
case in @xmath , one may apply the projective-superspace formalism
developed in [ 155 ] .

All off-shell higher-spin @xmath supermultiplets in AdS @xmath presented
in chapter 5 are reducible gauge theories (in the terminology of the
Batalin-Vilkovisky quantisation [ 194 ] ), similar to the massless
higher-spin supermultiplets in AdS @xmath [ 63 ] . The Lagrangian
quantisation of such theories is nontrivial, as demonstrated in [ 66 ]
in the 4D case. All off-shell higher-spin @xmath supermultiplets in AdS
@xmath , which were constructed in chapter 6 , are irreducible gauge
theories. They can be quantised using the Faddeev-Popov procedure [ 195
] as in the non-supersymmetric case, see e.g. [ 196 , 197 ] .

As a final comment, all off-shell supersymmetric massless higher-spin
models presented in this thesis (both in three and four dimensions)
share a common feature. After we reformulated the massless integer
superspin theories, one obtains a universal picture in which every
gauge-invariant action is now realised in terms of two dynamical
variables: a superconformal gauge prepotential and an appropriate set of
compensating superfield(s).

## Appendix A Notation and conventions

In this appendix we collect important definitions and identities that
have been used throughout the thesis. For a more rigorous presentation,
the reader is referred to [ 35 ] , which our 4D notation and conventions
mainly follow. Below are the types of indices that we use:

-   Lower case letters from the beginning (middle) of the Latin
    alphabet,
    i.e. @xmath correspond to flat (curved) spacetime indices.

-   Lower case letters from the beginning of the Greek alphabet, i.e.
    @xmath denote indices for two-component Weyl spinors.

-   Likewise, upper case letters from the beginning and middle of the
    Latin alphabet denote flat and curved superspace coordinates
    respectively.

### a.1 4D spinor and tensor identities

We use the mostly positive convention for the Minkowski metric:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (A.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

in order to raise and lower spacetime indices of tangent space tensors,
@xmath with @xmath . On the other hand, the indices of curved spacetime
tensors can be raised or lowered using the curved metric @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (A.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the vierbein. The inverse vierbein @xmath is introduced
by @xmath and @xmath .

The (brackets) parentheses denote (anti-)symmetrisation of tensor or
spinor indices, which include a normalisation factor, for instance

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (A.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath being the symmetric group of @xmath elements.

The totally antisymmetric Levi-Civita tensor, @xmath , is normalised
such that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (A.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

A product of Levi-Civita tensors can be written as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (A.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Central to the description of 4D @xmath supersymmetry is the formalism
of two-component Weyl spinors. These are representations of @xmath ,
which is the covering group of the restricted Lorentz group @xmath .
Specifically, an object @xmath ) which transforms under the fundamental
representation of @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (A.1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is called a left-handed Weyl spinor. This is denoted by @xmath and is
known as the left-handed spinor representation of the Lorentz group. On
the other hand, a right-handed Weyl spinor @xmath transforms in the
conjugate representation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (A.1.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This is denoted by @xmath and is called the right-handed spinor
representation of the Lorentz group.

The undotted and dotted indices of two-component spinors may be raised
and lowered with the help of @xmath tensors:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (A.1.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The antisymmetric tensors, @xmath and @xmath are invariant under @xmath
. They are defined by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (A.1.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We will adopt the following rules for contraction of spinor indices:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (A.1.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and @xmath . Here spinor conjugation is understood as Hermitian
conjugation,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (A.1.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We define the sigma matrices @xmath as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (A.1.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

i.e.

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (A.1.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The tilded sigma matrices with raised indices are denoted by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (A.1.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The sigma matrices satisfy some useful properties, for instance

  -- -------- -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      @xmath      (A.1.15)
     @xmath      @xmath      
  -- -------- -- -------- -- ----------

We can introduce the antisymmetric traceless matrices

  -- -------- -- -----------
                 
     @xmath      (A.1.16a)
     @xmath      (A.1.16b)
  -- -------- -- -----------

which are (anti) self-dual,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (A.1.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

They also satisfy the Lorentz algebra

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (A.1.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Given a vector @xmath , one can convert the vector index to a pair of
spinor indices using the @xmath -matrices. The rules are as follows

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (A.1.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As an example, let us consider a real and antisymmetric rank-2 tensor,
@xmath . The decomposition is

  ---------------------- -------- -- -----------
                                     
                         @xmath      (A.1.20a)
  Here we have defined               
                                     
                         @xmath      (A.1.20b)
  ---------------------- -------- -- -----------

In particular, this applies to the Lorentz generators, @xmath , which
satisfy the same algebra ( A.1.18 ) as the @xmath matrices. They act on
arbitrary spinors as follows:

  -- -------- -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      @xmath      (A.1.21)
     @xmath      @xmath      
  -- -------- -- -------- -- ----------

Let @xmath be the set of covariant derivatives of @xmath Minkowski
superspace. The spinor covariant derivatives, @xmath and @xmath , are
related by complex conjugation, which works as follows

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (A.1.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Here @xmath is the complex conjugate of @xmath . The Grassmann parity of
@xmath is denoted by @xmath i.e. @xmath for a bosonic superfield and
@xmath , if @xmath is fermionic. We also note that @xmath and @xmath .
It is important to keep in mind the following rules when doing
calculations with the covariant derivatives:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (A.1.23)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

for arbitrary superfields @xmath and @xmath .

### a.2 3D notation and AdS identities

We summarise our 3D notation and conventions following [ 113 , 169 ] .
The 3D Minkowski metric is @xmath . The spinor indices are raised and
lowered by the rule

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (A.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Here the antisymmetric @xmath invariant tensors @xmath and @xmath are
normalised as @xmath .

We make use of real Dirac @xmath -matrices, @xmath defined by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (A.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

They obey the algebra

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (A.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the Levi-Civita tensor is normalised as @xmath . Some useful
relations involving @xmath -matrices are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (A.2.4a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (A.2.4b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (A.2.4c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

Given a three-vector @xmath , it can be equivalently described by a
symmetric second-rank spinor @xmath defined as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (A.2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In the 3D case, an antisymmetric tensor @xmath is Hodge-dual to a
three-vector @xmath , specifically

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (A.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Then, the symmetric spinor @xmath , which is associated with @xmath ,
can equivalently be defined in terms of @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (A.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

These three algebraic objects, @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , are in
one-to-one correspondence to each other, @xmath . The corresponding
inner products are related to each other as follows:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (A.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The Lorentz generators with two vector indices ( @xmath ), one vector
index ( @xmath ) and two spinor indices ( @xmath ) are related to each
other by the rules:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (A.2.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

These generators act on a vector @xmath and a spinor @xmath as follows:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (A.2.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We collect some useful properties for @xmath AdS covariant derivatives,
which we denote by @xmath . We first note the unusual complex
conjugation property of the spinor covariant derivative, which can be
compared with the 4D case, see ( A.1.22 ). Given an arbitrary superfield
@xmath and its complex conjugate @xmath , it holds that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (A.2.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath denotes the Grassmann parity of @xmath .

Making use of the (anti)-commutation relation ( 6.1.2a ) and ( 6.1.2b ),
we obtain the following identities

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (A.2.12a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (A.2.12b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (A.2.12c)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (A.2.12d)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

where @xmath and @xmath . An important corollary of ( A.2.12a ) and (
A.2.12c ) is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (A.2.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The left-hand side of ( A.2.12d ) can be expressed in terms of the
quadratic Casimir operator of the 3D @xmath AdS supergroup [ 51 ] :

## Appendix B Conserved higher-spin currents in four dimensions

In appendix B.1 we consider the construction of conserved higher-spin
currents in free scalar field theory in flat space. Similar analysis for
free fermions will be done in the next section B.2 . This material has
been drawn from [ 3 ] .

### b.1 Free real scalars

Given an integer @xmath , the massless spin- @xmath field [ 31 ] is
described by real potentials @xmath and @xmath with the gauge freedom ¹
¹ 1 We follow the description of Fronsdal’s theory [ 31 ] given in
section 6.9 of [ 35 ] .

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.1.1a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.1.1b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

for an arbitrary real gauge parameter @xmath . The field @xmath may be
interpreted as a conformal spin- @xmath field [ 70 , 71 ] .

To construct non-conformal higher-spin currents, we couple @xmath and
@xmath to external sources

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.1.2)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

Requiring that @xmath be invariant under the @xmath -transformation in (
B.1.1 ) gives the conservation equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (B.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Our derivation of ( B.1.3 ) is analogous to that given in [ 106 ] .

Let us introduce the following operators

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.1.4a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.1.4b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The conservation equation ( B.1.3 ) then becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (B.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Note that both @xmath and @xmath are real.

Let us now consider the model for @xmath massless real scalar fields
@xmath , with @xmath , in Minkowski space

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (B.1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which admits conserved higher spin currents of the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (B.1.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a constant matrix. It can be shown that @xmath if @xmath
is odd and @xmath is symmetric. Similarly, @xmath if @xmath is even and
@xmath is antisymmetric. Thus, we have to consider two separate cases:
the case of even @xmath with symmetric @xmath and, the case of odd
@xmath with antisymmetric @xmath . Using the massless equation of motion
@xmath one may show that @xmath satisfies the conservation equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (B.1.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We now turn to the massive model

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (B.1.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a real, symmetric @xmath mass matrix. In the massive
theory, the conservation equation is described by ( B.1.5 ) and so we
first need to compute @xmath using the massive equations of motion

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (B.1.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

For symmetric @xmath , we obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.1.11)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

If @xmath is antisymmetric, we get

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.1.12)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

Thus, in the massive real scalars there are four cases to consider:

1.  Both @xmath and @xmath are symmetric @xmath even.

2.  @xmath is symmetric; @xmath is antisymmetric @xmath even.

3.  @xmath is antisymmetric; @xmath is symmetric @xmath odd.

4.  Both @xmath and @xmath are antisymmetric @xmath odd.

Case 1: Eq. ( B.1.11 ) is equivalent to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.1.13)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

We look for @xmath such that (i) it is real; and (ii) it satisfies the
conservation equation ( B.1.5 ). We consider a general ansatz

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (B.1.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

For @xmath , condition (ii) gives

  ---------------------------------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                                          
                                     @xmath   @xmath      
                                              @xmath      (B.1.15a)
  Condition (ii) also implies that                        
                                                          
                                     @xmath   @xmath      (B.1.15b)
  ---------------------------------- -------- -------- -- -----------

Equations ( B.1.15 ) lead to the following expression for @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -- -----------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.1.16a)
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.1.16b)
  -- -------- -------- -- -----------

One can check that the equations ( B.1.15 )–( B.1.15b ) are identically
satisfied if @xmath is even.

Case 2: If we take @xmath to be antisymmetric, a similar analysis shows
that no solution for @xmath exists for even @xmath .

Case 3: Now we consider the case where @xmath is antisymmetric and
@xmath symmetric. Again, similar consideration shows that no solution
for @xmath exists for odd @xmath .

Case 4: Eq. ( B.1.12 ) is equivalent to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.1.17)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

We consider a general ansatz

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (B.1.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Imposing (i) and (ii) and keeping in mind that @xmath is odd, we obtain
the following conditions for @xmath :

  ---------------------------------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                                          
                                     @xmath   @xmath      
                                              @xmath      (B.1.19a)
  Condition (ii) also implies that                        
                                                          
                                     @xmath   @xmath      (B.1.19b)
  ---------------------------------- -------- -------- -- -----------

Equations ( B.1.19 ) lead to the following expression for @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -- -----------
                          
     @xmath               (B.1.20a)
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.1.20b)
  -- -------- -------- -- -----------

One can check that the equations ( B.1.19 )–( B.1.19b ) are identically
satisfied if @xmath is odd.

### b.2 Free Majorana fermions

Let us now consider @xmath free massless Majorana fermions

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (B.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with the equation of motion

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (B.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We can construct the following higher spin currents

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.2.3)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.2.4)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

where we put an extra @xmath in eq. ( B.2.4 ) since @xmath has to be
real. Using the equation of motion ( 6.6.5 ), it can be shown that the
currents ( B.2.3 ), ( B.2.4 ) are conserved

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (B.2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We now look at the massive model

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (B.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a constant symmetric @xmath mass matrix. To construct
the conserved currents, we compute @xmath using the massive equations of
motion ( @xmath )

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.2.7a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.2.7b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

If @xmath is a real symmetric matrix, we find

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.2.8)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

If @xmath is antisymmetric, we have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.2.9)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

There are four cases to consider:

1.  @xmath are symmetric @xmath .

2.  @xmath symmetric; @xmath antisymmetric @xmath .

3.  @xmath antisymmetric; @xmath symmetric @xmath .

4.  @xmath are antisymmetric @xmath .

Case 1: Eq. ( B.2.8 ) becomes

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.2.10)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

We look for @xmath such that (i) it is real; and (ii) it satisfies the
conservation equation ( B.1.5 ):

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (B.2.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Consider a general ansatz

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.2.12)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

For @xmath , condition (i) gives

  ---------------------------------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                                          
                                     @xmath   @xmath      (B.2.13a)
  while condition (ii) gives                              
                                                          
                                     @xmath   @xmath      (B.2.13b)
                                                          
                                     @xmath               (B.2.13c)
  Condition (ii) also implies that                        
                                                          
                                     @xmath   @xmath      (B.2.13d)
                                                          
                                     @xmath   @xmath      (B.2.13e)
                                                          
                                     @xmath   @xmath      (B.2.13f)
  ---------------------------------- -------- -------- -- -----------

The above conditions lead to the following expressions for @xmath and
@xmath ( @xmath )

  ---------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                                                            
                                                       @xmath   @xmath      (B.2.14a)
                                                                            
                                                       @xmath   @xmath      (B.2.14b)
  If the parameter @xmath is even, ( B.2.14a ) gives                        
                                                                            
                                                       @xmath   @xmath      (B.2.14c)
  ---------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -- -----------

and ( B.2.13a )-( B.2.13f ) are identically satisfied. However, when
@xmath is odd, there appears an inconsistency: the right-hand side of (
B.2.13d ) is positive, while the left-hand side is negative, @xmath .
Therefore, our solution ( B.2.14 ) is only consistent for @xmath .

Case 2: If @xmath is antisymmetric while @xmath symmetric, eq. ( B.2.8 )
is slightly modified

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.2.15)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

Starting with a general ansatz

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.2.16)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

and imposing conditions (i) and (ii) yield

  -- -------- -------- -- -----------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.2.17a)
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.2.17b)
                          
     @xmath               (B.2.17c)
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.2.17d)
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.2.17e)
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.2.17f)
  -- -------- -------- -- -----------

As a result, the coefficients @xmath and @xmath are given by ( @xmath )

  ----------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                                                             
                                                        @xmath   @xmath      (B.2.18a)
                                                                             
                                                        @xmath   @xmath      (B.2.18b)
  When the parameter @xmath is odd, ( B.2.18a ) gives                        
                                                                             
                                                        @xmath   @xmath      (B.2.18c)
  ----------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -- -----------

and ( B.2.17a )-( B.2.17f ) are identically satisfied. However, when
@xmath is even, there appears an inconsistency: the right-hand side of (
B.2.17d ) is positive, while the left-hand side is negative, @xmath .
Therefore, our solution ( B.2.18 ) is only consistent for @xmath .

Finally, we consider @xmath with the corresponding @xmath given by (
B.2.4 ). Similar considerations show that in Case 3 , the non-conformal
currents exist only if @xmath is even. The trace @xmath is given by (
B.2.12 ) with the coefficients @xmath and @xmath given by

  -- -------- -------- -- -----------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.2.19a)
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.2.19b)
  -- -------- -------- -- -----------

In Case 4 , the non-conformal currents exist only for odd values of
@xmath . The trace @xmath is given by ( B.2.16 ) with the coefficients
@xmath and @xmath given by

  -- -------- -------- -- -----------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.2.20a)
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.2.20b)
  -- -------- -------- -- -----------

We observe that the coefficients @xmath and @xmath in eq. ( B.2.19a )
and ( B.2.19b ), respectively differ from similar coefficients in (
B.2.14a ) and ( B.2.14b ) by a factor of @xmath . Hence, for even @xmath
we may define a more general supercurrent

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (B.2.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is a generic matrix which can be split into the symmetric
and antisymmetric parts: @xmath . Here both @xmath and @xmath are real
and we put an @xmath in front of @xmath because @xmath must be real.
From the above consideration it then follows that the corresponding more
general solution for @xmath reads

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.2.22)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . The coefficients @xmath and @xmath
are given by eqs. ( B.2.14a ) and ( B.2.14b ), respectively. Similarly,
the coefficients @xmath and @xmath in ( B.2.20a ) and ( B.2.20b ) differ
from similar coefficients in ( B.2.18a ) and ( B.2.18b ) by a factor of
@xmath . This means that for odd @xmath we can define a more general
supercurrent ( B.2.21 ), where @xmath is a generic matrix which we can
split as before into the symmetric and antisymmetric parts, @xmath .
From the above consideration it then follows that the corresponding more
general solution for @xmath reads

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.2.23)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . The coefficients @xmath and @xmath
are given by eqs. ( B.2.18a ) and ( B.2.18b ), respectively.

## Appendix C Component analysis of @xmath higher-spin actions in three
dimensions

In this appendix we discuss the component structure of the two new
off-shell @xmath supersymmetric higher-spin theories in three
dimensions: the transverse massless superspin- @xmath multiplet ( 6.2.29
), and the transverse massless superspin- @xmath multiplet ( 6.3.21 ).
The longitudinal actions ( 6.2.25 ) and ( 6.3.2.1 ) can be reduced to
components in a similar fashion. For simplicity we will carry out our
analysis in flat Minkowski superspace. This material has been drawn from
[ 6 ] .

### c.1 Massless superspin-@xmath action

In accordance with ( 6.1.41 ), the component form of an @xmath
supersymmetric action is computed by the rule

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Let us first work out the component structure of the massless integer
superspin model ( 6.2.29 ). In the flat superspace limit, the transverse
action ( 6.2.29 ) takes the form

  -- -------- -- -- -------- ---------
     @xmath                  (C.1.2)
                             
                    @xmath   
                    @xmath   
  -- -------- -- -- -------- ---------

As described in ( 6.2.31 ), it is possible to choose a gauge condition
@xmath , such that the above action turns into

  -- -------- -- -- -------- ---------
     @xmath                  (C.1.3)
                             
                    @xmath   
                    @xmath   
                    @xmath   
  -- -------- -- -- -------- ---------

It is invariant under the following gauge transformations

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.1.4a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.1.4b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

where the gauge parameter @xmath is a real unconstrained superfield.

The gauge freedom ( C.1.4 ) can be used to impose a Wess-Zumino gauge

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In order to preserve these gauge conditions, the residual gauge freedom
has to be constrained by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

These imply that there remain two independent, real components of @xmath
:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.1.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In the gauge ( 4.5.15 ), the independent component fields of @xmath can
be chosen as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.1.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We define the component fields of @xmath as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.1.9)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.1.10)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.1.11)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

Applying the reduction rule ( C.1.1 ) to the @xmath action ( C.1.3 ), we
find that it splits into bosonic and fermionic parts:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (C.1.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The bosonic action is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (C.1.13)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

Integrating out the auxiliary field @xmath leads to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (C.1.14)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

This action is invariant under the gauge transformations

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.1.15)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.1.16)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The gauge transformations for the fields @xmath and @xmath can be easily
read off from the gauge transformations of the superfields @xmath and
@xmath , respectively. Modulo an overall normalisation factor, ( C.1.14
) corresponds to the massless Fronsdal spin- @xmath action @xmath
described in [ 51 ] .

The fermionic sector of the component action is described by the real
dynamical fields @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , defined modulo gauge
transformations of the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.1.17)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.1.18)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.1.19)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The gauge-invariant action is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (C.1.20)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

It may be shown that @xmath coincides with the Fang-Fronsdal spin-
@xmath action, @xmath [ 51 ] .

We have thus proved that at the component level and upon elimination of
the auxiliary field, the transverse theory ( 4.5.11 ) is equivalent to a
sum of two massless models: the bosonic Fronsdal spin- @xmath model and
the fermionic Fang-Fronsdal spin- @xmath model.

### c.2 Massless superspin-@xmath action

We now elaborate on the component structure of the massless half-integer
superspin model in the transverse formulation ( 6.3.21a ). The theory is
described in terms of the real unconstrained prepotentials @xmath and
@xmath . In Minkowski superspace, the action ( 6.3.21a ) simplifies into

  -- -------- -- -- -------- ---------
     @xmath                  (C.2.1)
                             
                    @xmath   
                    @xmath   
                    @xmath   
  -- -------- -- -- -------- ---------

with the following gauge symmetry

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.2.2a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.2.2b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

The action ( C.2.1 ) involves the real field strength @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The gauge transformations ( C.2.2 ) allow us to impose a Wess-Zumino
gauge on the prepotentials:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The residual gauge symmetry preserving the conditions ( C.2.4 ) is
characterised by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.2.5a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.2.5b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.2.5c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

As a result, there are three independent, real gauge parameters at the
component level, which we define as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Let us now represent the prepotential @xmath in terms of its irreducible
components,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where we have introduced the two irreducible components of @xmath by the
rule

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (C.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The next step is to determine the remaining independent component fields
of @xmath and @xmath in the Wess-Zumino gauge ( C.2.4 ).

In the bosonic sector, we have the following set of fields:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.2.9a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.2.9b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.2.9c)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.2.9d)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

Reduction of the action ( C.2.1 ) to components leads to the following
bosonic action:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (C.2.10)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

which proves to be invariant under gauge transformations of the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.2.11a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.2.11b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.2.11c)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.2.11d)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

Let us consider the fermionic sector. We find that the independent
fermionic fields are:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.2.12a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.2.12b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.2.12c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

and their gauge transformation laws are given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.2.13a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.2.13b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.2.13c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -----------

The above fermionic fields correspond to the dynamical variables of the
Fang-Fronsdal spin- @xmath model. As follows from ( C.2.13a ), ( C.2.13b
) and ( C.2.13c ), their gauge freedom is equivalent to that of the
massless spin- @xmath gauge field. Indeed, direct calculations of the
component action give the standard massless gauge-invariant spin- @xmath
action @xmath .

The component structure of the obtained supermultiplets is a
three-dimensional counterpart of so-called (reducible) higher-spin
triplet systems. In AdS @xmath an action for bosonic higher-spin
triplets was constructed in [ 188 ] and for fermionic triplets in [ 189
, 190 ] . Our superfield construction provides a manifestly off-shell
supersymmetric generalisation of these systems. It might be of interest
to extend it to AdS @xmath .
