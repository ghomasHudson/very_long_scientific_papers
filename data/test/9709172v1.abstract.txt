This is a revised and shortened version of a MSc thesis submitted to the
University of Sussex, UK.

An introduction into the pre-string physics of black holes and related
thermodynamics is given. Then, starting with an introduction of how
superstring theory is approaching the problem of black hole entropy,
work on that and closely related topics like Hawking radiation and the
information paradox is reviewed.
