This thesis investigates in the use of access log data as a source of
information for identifying related scientific papers. This is done for
arXiv.org , the authority for publication of e-prints in several fields
of physics. Compared to citation information, access logs have the
advantage of being immediately available, without manual or automatic
extraction of the citation graph. Because of that, a main focus is on
the question, how far user behavior can serve as a replacement for
explicit meta-data, which potentially might be expensive or completely
unavailable. Therefore, we compare access, content, and citation-based
measures of relatedness on different recommendation tasks. As a final
result, an online recommendation system has been built that can help
scientists to find further relevant literature, without having to search
for them actively.
