Recent astrophysical data indicate that our universe might currently be
in a de Sitter (dS) phase. The importance of dS space has been primarily
ignited by the study of the inflationary model of the universe and the
quantum gravity. As we know Einsteinâ€™s theory of gravitation (with a
nonzero cosmological constant) can be interpreted as a theory of a
metric field; that is, a symmetric tensor field of rank- @xmath on a
fixed de Sitter background. It has been shown the massless spin- @xmath
Fierz-Pauli wave equation (or the linearized Einstein equation) is not
conformally invariant. This result is in contrary with what we used to
expect for massless theories. In this thesis we obtain conformally
invariant wave equation for the massless spin- @xmath in the dS space.
This study is motivated by the belief that conformal invariance may be
the key to a future theory of quantum gravity.
