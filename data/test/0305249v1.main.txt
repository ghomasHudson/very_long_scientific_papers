## Chapter \thechapter Introduction

It has been known for a while now that the world of disk patterns is
intimately connected to the world of geometric uniformization. To orient
ourselves to what this statement means it is useful to mention the most
famous case. The disk pattern is the Koebe theorem which guarantees that
a specified (reasonably nice) graph embedded in the closed unit disk can
be realized as the nerve of a disk pattern, which is in fact unique up
to Möbius equivalence. In [ 18 ] Thurston presented the idea of (nicely)
packing a bounded simply connected planar domain, recording the nerve of
this packing, and then using a suitably normalized solution to the Koebe
disk pattern with respect to this nerve in order to approximate the
conformal mapping of this region to the disk. That such a mapping exits
is our first example of a geometric uniformization problem, the Riemann
mapping theorem. Thurston’s procedure has been verified to work in
several cases. In fact this conjecture has been solved in several cases.
The case of using a finer and finer hexagonal disk pattern for the
approximation is very well understood; it was first shown to uniformly
approximate the Riemann mapping in [ 16 ] and is now seen in [ 10 ] to
approximate uniformly all of the Riemann mapping’s derivatives.

In this thesis another connection between these two stories is
developed. For now I’ll give a brief outline which can be viewed as an
introduction to the introduction. Precise statement of the below
discussion can be found in the elaborated introduction, sections 1.1 -
1.3.

In this thesis a generalization of a disk pattern theorem often called
the Thurston-Andreev theorem is presented, which is the solution to a
disk pattern problem on a compact surface. To be precise, in chapter two
of this thesis we prove…

###### Result 1

Given a geodesic triangular decomposition of a hyperbolic surface one
can associate combinatorial data: the topological class of the
triangular decomposition and to each edge the angle between the
circumscribing circles of the two triangles sharing the edge. If the
angle data is in @xmath then this combinatorial data uniquely determines
both the hyperbolic structure and the geodesic triangulation.
Furthermore, if one starts with a topological triangular decomposition
of a compact surface with @xmath , and angles with values in @xmath
assigned to each edge satisfying certain necessary linear conditions
(conditions @xmath – @xmath of section 6.1 ), then there is a hyperbolic
surface and geodesic triangular decomposition realizing this data.

The angles in @xmath case is well known, see [ 17 ] . This theorem has
several interpretations in terms of not only a disk pattern problem, but
also as a convex hyperbolic polyhedron production theorem, and perhaps
most importantly (from the uniformization point of view) as a geodesic
triangulation production theorem. This triangulation production can be
viewed as the second step in the proof of the above result. The first
step is a completely linear max-flow-min cut-type problem guaranteeing
that given such edge angle data one can produce triangle angle data
which “formally” has the same edge angle data associated to it. Given
such triangle angle data one can measure how uniform this data is by
using an energy on the set of possible conformally equivalent angle
data. This energy is larger when one is closer to the angle data of a
geodesic triangulation of a hyperbolic surface (so for aesthetic reasons
I’ve chosen an energy which one tries to maximize, my apologies to the
physicists). The proof becomes to guarantee the existence of a unique
set of angle data maximizing this energy and to show it corresponds to
the unique solution of the above disk pattern result.

The geometric uniformization theorem which this result will be shown
intimately related to, is the uniformization for geometric surfaces,
namely:

###### Result 2

Every Riemannian surface is conformally equivalent to a Riemannian
surface with constant Gaussian curvature.

This theorem is very well known. The heart of what takes place here is
that in chapter 4 there is a proof of the above uniformization theorem
which is directly related to the above disk pattern theorem and its
proof. This relationship is to first (as above) solve the completely
linear problem of finding a varying negative curvature metric, then we
can measure how distant this metric is from a constant curvature metric
by averaging the energy associated to data provided by randomly selected
triangulations. In the end one finds the same arguments used to
uniformize the discrete angle data can be applied to this averaged
energy on the space of metrics, providing a nice proof of the
uniformization theorem of surfaces. This is not the first energy method
proof of this theorem, in fact there are many. One particularly
interesting energy is the @xmath as used in [ 2 ] . In fact these random
energies are related to the @xmath , and in section 1.3 this
relationship is made explicit.

The main tool in articulating the averaging procedure is a detailed
understanding of random Delaunay triangulations. The details of this
understanding form chapter 3. I think these triangulations are quite
interesting independent of their connection to metric uniformization,
and I hope to convince others of this by beginning the precise
introduction with a probabilistic proof on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.

It is worth noting that these ideas may be explored in three-dimensions.
In fact much of what takes place here can be viewed as realization in
two dimensions of an idea by Peter Doyle to prove that a three manifold
accepting a varying negative curvature metric also accepts a constant
sectional curvature metric. If proved this result would shed
considerable light on Thurston’s uniformization conjecture. In section
1.3 I sketch the three dimensional strategy, as related to the two
dimensional strategy presented in 1.1-1.2.

### 1 A New Proof of the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem

The Gauss-Bonnet formula in its most primitive form is stated for a
compact boundaryless surface endowed with a geometry as:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The quantity, @xmath , being integrated over the surface, @xmath , is
the Gaussian curvature, and on the right-hand side is the Euler
Characteristic. The Euler characteristic is a topological invariant of
the surface which can be computed from triangulation as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the number of vertices, @xmath is the number of edges,
and @xmath is the number of faces in the triangulation. In a somewhat
unintelligible nut shell, the proof here is accomplished by randomly
triangulating the surface and then noting while the Euler characteristic
is constant the other (now random variables) @xmath , @xmath , and
@xmath have expected values which can be computed and compared to this
constant. As the density of the randomly distributed vertices goes to
infinity one finds these expected values produce the Gauss-Bonnet
formula, along with a probabilistic interpretation of curvature.

This proof’s initial need is an articulation of what a random
triangulation of a surface is. The first step is to ignore the fact that
anything random is going on here and to simply attempt to construct a a
geodesic triangulation in a fixed metric @xmath from a given set of
points, @xmath . To do this one examines all the triples and pairs in
@xmath and decides whether or not to put in a face for a given triple or
an edge for a given pair; this decision procedure will be relative to a
certain positive number @xmath – the decision radius. The procedure
(with its origin found in Delaunay’s “empty sphere” method, see [ 5 ] )
is to formally put in a face for a triple or an edge for a pair if the
triple or pair lies on a disk of radius less @xmath which has its
interior empty of points in @xmath . Clearly every pair on a face forms
an edge (though not necessarily the converse), hence at this moment we
have an abstract two complex. Call this abstract complex @xmath and
denote a polyhedral realization as @xmath (for a realization of it place
the points at @xmath and @xmath in @xmath and take the convex hull of
the subsets found in @xmath ).

Our goal now is to realize this polyhedron inside the surface, which
will involve restricting @xmath . To get going we must recall a well
known geometric constant associated to the surface, the injectivity
radius, which is the largest number @xmath such that if @xmath then
there is a unique geodesic between @xmath and @xmath of length less than
@xmath . If one assumes that @xmath one can (see the proof of ) produce
a continuous map

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with the edges parameterizing geodesics in the @xmath metric. That our
procedure forms a triangulation is now equivalent to @xmath being a
homeomorphism; and in such a case we will call the resulting
triangulation a Delaunay triangulation. Such triangulations typically
will look locally like figure 1 .

At this point it is useful to find a geometric criterion on a set of
points @xmath guaranteeing that it forms a triangulation. To accomplish
this it is useful to recall a second geometric constant associated to
the surface: the strong convexity radius @xmath . On a compact surface
it is the largest number with the property that in a disk of radius less
than @xmath the interior of the unique minimal length geodesic
connecting any pair of points in the disk’s closure is in the disk’s
interior. We may now introduce our criterion for triangulation
detection: we will call a set of points @xmath @xmath -dense if each
open ball of radius @xmath contains at least one @xmath and @xmath
contains no four of its points is on a circle of radius less than @xmath
. With this concept we will prove in section 2.2 the following theorem…

###### Theorem 1

If @xmath is @xmath -dense with @xmath , then @xmath forms a Delaunay
triangulation.

From here on out always assume the decision radius @xmath satisfies
@xmath .

Now comes the second step in this proof: to put down random sets of
points. The points will be distributed with a density @xmath via a
Poisson distribution relative to @xmath (developed in the section 2.3),
and it is convenient to also randomly select an ordering of the points
after placing them down. In technical terms, any such point
configuration will be denoted p and will live in a measure space @xmath
with a probability measure @xmath and specified measurable sets @xmath -
all of which are constructed in section 2.3. For now all we need to
understand are certain basic properties and terminology. Let @xmath be
measurable with area @xmath . The first property is the characteristic
property of the Poisson distribution, namely the set of point
configurations in @xmath with exactly @xmath points in @xmath is an
element of @xmath with measure @xmath .

Recall a random variable on @xmath is simply a @xmath measurable
function. We will encounter several in this proof, namely @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath , and the characteristic (indicator) functions of
various measurable sets (denoted @xmath with @xmath measurable). The
expected value of a random variable @xmath is the integral of the
function over @xmath with respect to the measure @xmath , and will be
denoted @xmath . As an example of such an expected value, using @xmath
to denote the area on @xmath , we have from the above characteristic
property

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which reveals the use of the term density for @xmath . The most
important set for us in @xmath is the set @xmath consisting of
configurations which have Delaunay triangulations associated to them. By
theorem , when our points are put in with a high density we expect they
will typically form Delaunay triangulations. Allowing @xmath to mean a
quantity decaying faster than any polynomial in @xmath , in section 2.3
we prove this with:

###### Theorem 2

If @xmath is any one of @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , or @xmath , then
@xmath is measurable and has expected value @xmath .

Now one observes that the Euler characteristic of any configuration in
@xmath is the Euler characteristic of an actual triangulation, hence the
constant @xmath ; so along with the above theorem one has

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Applying the mathematical triviality, yet philosophical miracle, that
expected values add gives us

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In an actual triangulation we have @xmath so

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

As explored above, we have the expected number of vertices is @xmath ;
this along with theorem gives us

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

So finally using theorem one last time we find:

###### Formula 1 (Euler-Delaunay-Poisson Formula)

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The goal now becomes to compute @xmath . Now a triple of points
occurring in a Poisson configuration, @xmath , forms a face exactly when
one of its associated disks is empty of points. The first thing we’d
like is that we are in fact talking about a unique such disk. This is
the most sophisticated fact needed, and occurs throughout the proof.
I’ll record it here for future reference; for a couple of proofs see [
12 ] :

###### Lemma 1 (The Small Circle Intersection Lemma)

If a triple of points lies on a the boundary of a disk with radius less
than @xmath , then this disk is unique among disks of radius less than
@xmath . (Recall @xmath .)

Back to the computation, by the characteristic property of the Poisson
distribution the probability any area @xmath disk is empty is @xmath .
So letting @xmath be the set of ordered triples living on circles of
radius less than @xmath , we now see the probability that @xmath has an
associated face should be @xmath , with @xmath the area of @xmath ’s
uniquely associated disk. This together with the fact that the expected
number of triples is @xmath leads one to hope, as is confirmed in the
beginning of section 3, that

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (1)
  -- -------- -- -----

To compute this explicitly it is necessary to put coordinates on @xmath
. First one chooses a way to discuss directions at all but a finite
number of tangent planes of @xmath (via a orthonormal frame). Then one
can parameterize a full measure subset of @xmath with a subset of @xmath
by hitting the triple described by sitting at the point @xmath and
moving a distance @xmath in each of the three directions @xmath , @xmath
, and @xmath . That this is a legal parameterization is easily deduced
from lemma 1 , and discussed in section 8.2 . Note that when fixing
@xmath and varying @xmath in these coordinates one produces the Jacobi
field @xmath ; whose norm I will call @xmath . Using this notation,
letting @xmath , and letting @xmath be the area of the triangle in the
Euclidean unit circle with vertices at the points corresponding to the
@xmath , we will see in section 3.1 that equation (1) expressed in these
new coordinates is

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (2)
  -- -------- -- -----

Both @xmath and the area of a ball function, @xmath , are directly
related to the curvature; with this relationship equation 2 can be
expressed as

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (3)
  -- -------- -- -----

with the @xmath a well controlled function of @xmath , @xmath , @xmath
and @xmath . In fact the @xmath term is so controlled that there is a
@xmath associated to the surface such that if @xmath after integrating
one can reduce equation 3 to

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (4)
  -- -------- -- -----

with the @xmath (see section 8.3 for the details concerning 3 and 4 and
the related estimates).

In particular we may now plug this into the Euler-Delaunay-Poisson
Formula (formula 1 ) to give simultaneously a probabilistic
interpretation of curvature and new proof of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.

###### Formula 2 (Euler-Gauss-Bonnet-Delaunay Formula)

Using a decision radius @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Note this allows us to interpret the Gaussian curvature as the defect in
the expected number of faces in a random Delaunay triangulation in the
surface’s geometry from what would be expected in Euclidean space.

### 2 Conformal Geometry and Uniformization

The techniques used in the previous section to prove the Gauss-Bonnet
theorem can be used to examine certain aspects of conformal geometry.
The ideas will involve the comparison of conformally equivalent metrics.
In terms of Riemannian metrics we say two metrics on @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath , are conformally equivalent if @xmath for a smooth function
@xmath . We will always be thinking in terms of a fixed background
metric called @xmath and will label its associated geometric objects
like its gradient, Laplacian, curvature, norm, area element, or area as
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath or @xmath . For the @xmath
metric we shall denote these object with an @xmath subscript.

The key to using the ideas of the previous section is the development of
a discrete analog of a conformal structure and a conformal
transformation relative to a Delaunay triangulation. The most important
observations in guessing this discrete structure concerns two triangles
@xmath and @xmath in a Delaunay triangulation sharing an edge @xmath ,
and the intersection angle @xmath between the circles in which @xmath
and @xmath are inscribed (see figure 2 ). The facts of use to us are
that @xmath and @xmath is preserved under a conformal deformation of the
metric up to order @xmath (see formula 29 in section 9.1 ).

To use this information it is necessary to note @xmath can be written
down accurately in terms of the angles within the triangles.

###### Formula 3

Letting @xmath , @xmath and @xmath be the angles in @xmath as in figure
2 we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It is worth noting this formula is exactly true on a surface with
constant curvature. One proof of this formula in the negative curvature
case utilizes an object, an ideal hyperbolic prism, that will turn out
to be fundamental to all that takes place here; and it is useful to
construct and discuss it now. That it shows up at such a fundamental
point in understanding the triangulations will hopefully inspire its
otherwise unexpected appearance in the next section.

The prism is constructed from the angle data of a hyperbolic triangle,
namely a set of positive angles @xmath such that @xmath . To construct
it first form a hyperbolic triangle with the @xmath data, then place the
triangle on a hyperbolic plane and then place the plane in hyperbolic
three space. Now union this triangle with the geodesics perpendicular to
this 2-plane going through the vertices of the triangle. The prism of
interest is the convex hull of this arrangement, See figure 3 .

With these conformal geometry facts in mind we may set up our discrete
conformal geometry.

#### 2.1 Discrete Uniformization

The discrete object replacing a metric is the information naturally
associated to a Delaunay geodesic triangulation living on the surface in
this metric; namely a topological triangulation, @xmath , and the angles
in all the triangles. Given @xmath there are @xmath slots @xmath in
which one can insert possible triangle angles, which we will place an
order on and identify with a basis of a @xmath dimensional real vector
space. With this basis choice we will denote this vector space as @xmath
, and denote vectors in it as @xmath . Let @xmath be a dual vector such
that @xmath . Sometimes we will refer to the angles in a fixed triangle,
and will abuse notation in order to refer to figure 2 by letting @xmath
, @xmath , and @xmath .

We will require that these angles satisfy certain requirements that the
angles in an actual Delaunay triangulation would satisfy. In particular
we require that all the angles are in @xmath and that the sum of all the
angle at a vertex is @xmath .

Motivated from the previous section we define the intersection angle at
an edge to be the function

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with the notation inspired from figure 2 . The Delaunay quality is
reflected in the fact that the “intersection angles” must satisfy @xmath
for each edge @xmath . It is worth noting that as an immediate
consequence of the fact that the angles sum to @xmath at a vertex we
have that the angle discrepancies at a vertex @xmath sums to @xmath at a
vertex as well, see section 6.1 .

We will call angles satisfying the above requirements a Delaunay angle
system. With the previous section as motivation, we define a pair of
Delaunay angle systems @xmath and @xmath to be conformally equivalent if
they arise form the same triangulation and if for each edge @xmath the
@xmath .

Motivated by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem we define the curvature of a
triangle @xmath relative to the Delaunay angle system @xmath to be
@xmath , where @xmath is the angle data corresponding to angle slots in
@xmath . On a surface with @xmath there is a very simple set of linear
equations which will gaurentee that a Delaunay angle system is
conformally equivalent to a Delaunay angle system where each triangle
has negative curvature.

Let @xmath be a set of triangles in @xmath , and denote the cardinality
of @xmath as @xmath . Let condition ( @xmath ) on a set of angles @xmath
associated to all the edges of @xmath be the condition that for any set
of triangles @xmath we have

@xmath @xmath

As an immediate consequence of theorem 9 we have the following lemma.

###### Lemma 2 (The Discrete Teleportation Lemma)

A Delaunay angle system @xmath has @xmath satisfying @xmath if and only
if @xmath is conformally equivalent to a negative curvature Delaunay
angle system.

We will only be concerned with Delaunay angle systems satisfying the the
conditions of this lemma, which note includes the angle data associated
to a Delaunay triangulation of surface with varying negative curvature.
Denote the convex bounded set of negative curvature angle systems
conformal to a given one, @xmath , as @xmath .

The pleasure derived from the Delaunay angle systems comes from a
beautiful Energy which lives on @xmath . Let @xmath denote the volume of
the ideal hyperbolic prism constructed from @xmath ’s angle data
relative to @xmath , as described in the previous section. Now simply
let the energy be

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The points where @xmath attains a maximum will be of great interest to
us. It is worth noting that @xmath is a continuous function on the
compact set @xmath , so attains its maximum. In fact it is an immediate
consequence of lemma 5 in section 4.4 that the angle system with maximal
energy is in fact in @xmath . An understanding of this as well as the
energies behavior at critical points comes from understanding its
differential. To interpret it let @xmath , @xmath and @xmath denote the
edge lengths opposite to the angle @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath in the
hyperbolic triangle determined by the angle data @xmath (which once
again exists since @xmath ). In formula 8 of section 4.4 the following
formula is produced:

###### Formula 4

@xmath with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ’s angle data is @xmath , and the @xmath
, @xmath , and @xmath are determined as above.

In order to best exploit this formula it is necessary to note (see the
proof of corollary 1 in section 4.4 ) that the tangent space at any
point of @xmath can be described explicitly as the translation to that
point of the span over all edges of the vectors

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

as in figure . The loveliness of this energy can now be expressed in
terms the following observation about its critical points (i.e. where
@xmath ).

###### Observation 1

From the above formula and the above description of @xmath we see at a
critical point @xmath of the energy in a conformal class satisfies

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for all edges @xmath with the notation coming form as usual from figure
2 . Hence at a critical point of @xmath we have that @xmath and the set
of @xmath curvature triangles formed from the given angle data fit
together to form an actual constant curvature surface.

I will call the Delaunay angle system of such a critical point a uniform
angle system. The question becomes: how many (if any) uniform structures
can be associated to a given angle system? From above we know there is
at least one internal maximum and in fact @xmath is strictly concave
down (see lemma 4 in 4.4 ). So any critical point is a maximum and
unique, as needed.

###### Theorem 3 (Discrete Uniformization Theorem)

If @xmath and @xmath is a Delaunay angle system where @xmath satisfies
@xmath then @xmath is conformally equivalent to a unique uniform angle
system.

It is worth noting that there is a rephrasing of the above
uniformization construction in terms of a solution to a disk pattern
problem, namely as a corollary of theorem 9 in section 6.1

###### Theorem 4

If one is given a topological triangulation of a surface with @xmath and
a set @xmath associated to the edges satisfying both condition @xmath
and that at each vertex @xmath , then there is a uniquely associated
constant curvature surface on which the given triangulation is realized
as a geodesic triangulation and the circles in which the triangles live
meet with the specified @xmath angles.

Solutions to problems similar to this are well known. The first solution
to such a pattern problem goes back to Koebe and pattern problems
closely related to the above corollary were implicit in the work of
Andreev [ 1 ] and then rediscovered and articulated in this language by
Thurston (see [ 17 ] ).The above theorem (actually a generalization of
it found in 6.1 ) is a generalization to arbitrary angles of the convex
ideal case of the Thurston-Andreev theorem. The first solutions to these
pattern problems using energy methods (as far as I’m aware) can be found
in [ 4 ] , and energy methods using hyperbolic volumes (in the toroidal
case) have there earliest versions in [ 3 ] and later in [ 14 ] .

#### 2.2 Continuous Uniformization

Now we’d like to mimic the uniformization procedure in the previous
section for metrics. For metrics by uniform structure I will mean a
metric @xmath with constant curvature. It is useful to note that @xmath
.

For starters let us note in the metric world we still have

###### Lemma 3 (The Metric Teleportation Lemma)

Every metric on a surface is conformally equivalent to a metric with
either negative, positive , or zero curvature.

Proof: This is a consequence of the Fredholm alternative, which says if
@xmath satisfies @xmath then @xmath . Since @xmath we have there is a
smooth @xmath satisfying @xmath and hence @xmath as required.

q.e.d

With this observation in our @xmath world we will restrict our attention
to metrics with strictly negative curvature. It is worth noting that as
in the discrete teleportation lemma the problem is linear.

Now given a varying negative curvature metric @xmath if we chose a
@xmath and topological triangulation @xmath with @xmath as vertices then
we could measure how close to uniform @xmath is with the energy of the
previous section. Namely we could let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is computed using the angle data associate to the
“triangulation” viewed in the @xmath metric. This of course means
connecting the needed vertices of @xmath with @xmath geodesics and
measuring the resulting @xmath angles. Notice this makes sense for
sufficient @xmath dense points since by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for
geodesic triangles the angles in a triangle @xmath will indeed satisfy

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This gives us a measurement of uniformity relative to @xmath and @xmath
and to rid this dependency it is natural to average this measurement
over all complexes as in section 1 . To do so weight the point
distribution and decide how to form the complexes using a fixed metric
@xmath and density @xmath , and then compute @xmath . It’s worth noting
that it may be necessary to shrink the decision radius down a bit to
make sense out of this construction, since we’d like points in a triple
to be within the injectivity radius of each other in both metrics. As
with the random variables of section 1 this random variable is naturally
expressed as the sum over all the faces @xmath of a function dependent
only on the data associated to an individual face, so we would expect
the computations of 1 to go through.

It is clear that the higher the vertex density the higher the percentage
of triangulations involved, hence the more sensitive this energy should
be to measuring the uniformity of the curvature. With this as
inspiration we proceed as with as with our Euler characteristic
computation and take the limit as the density of vertices goes to
infinity. Let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and note the second term @xmath is independent of @xmath and needed only
to normalize the computation. We will show that among @xmath with with
@xmath this formula is equivalent to

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (5)
  -- -------- -- -----

The energy is clearly scale invariant and @xmath , so we see that it is
natural to consider the energy as a function on the “energy norm”
closure of

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Using the energy norm allows us to use compactness arguments to
gaurentee the existence of a maximum, just as in the discrete case (for
the details of everything that takes place in this section see section
10 ). Also as in the discrete we can easily force the maximum into the
the interior (where @xmath ). This requires looking at the energy’s
Frechét differential, which is quite revealing.

###### Formula 5

The Frechét derivative of @xmath at @xmath in the direction @xmath is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This formula for Frechét derivative guarantees that @xmath is constant
and @xmath is smooth. The easiest way to understand this is to recall
the Fredholm Alternative described in the poof of lemma 3 and observe…

###### Observation 2

The above formula insures us that if we knew the critical @xmath to be a
@xmath function then @xmath would @xmath orthogonal to the image of
@xmath under the Laplacian, so by the Fredholm alternative @xmath is
constant. Hence we indeed see that a critical point of @xmath should be
a metric of constant negative curvature.

Just as in the discrete case at this point concavity comes to the rescue
to gaurentee uniqueness. Since everything is @xmath we really can use
the fact that the Frechét Hessian at @xmath applied to @xmath

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (6)
  -- -------- -- -----

is strictly negative at a non-zero @xmath to gaurentee the critical
point is in fact unique.

So just as in the discrete case we arrive at the uniformization theorem
(although only when @xmath ).

###### Theorem 5 (The Metric Uniformization Theorem)

Every metric is conformally equivalent to a unique metric of constant
curvature.

#### 2.3 The Determinant of the Laplacian and Entropy

The use of energies to solve the uniformization problem is not at all
new, and it is nice to relate this process to some other more familiar
energies. The method of producing other energies is to average over
metrics using the varying metric to distribute the points. So in this
section I will superscript the expected values with the metric used to
construct the point distribution.

The first variant I will describe has the advantage of not needing to be
restricted to a conformal class. It involves a function on the space of
metrics I call the entropy

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The fact is that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

So viewing @xmath as fixed we have an energy on all metrics - which can
be checked to optimize at a constant curvature metric and be strictly
concave down in a conformal class.

More interestingly is the following energy.

###### Theorem 6

There is a constant @xmath such that on the set of all metrics @xmath
conformally equivalent to @xmath of a fixed area

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

As we shall see in section 9.2 , the key to being able to make this
interpretation is the beautiful integral formulation of the @xmath due
to Polyakov (see [ 13 ] ). The @xmath was found to have the
uniformization property by Osgood, Phillips, and Sarnak (see [ 2 ] ). In
[ 4 ] Yves Colin de Verdiére suggested that energies related to circle
pattern problems might be related to the determinant of the Laplacian.
This procedure provides such a relationship.

### 3 Three-dimensional Dreams

The entire two dimensional story has a three dimensional wishful analog.

##### 3.0.1 Discrete Uniformization

The discrete case is essentially an idea do to Casson for deforming a
triangulated three manifold into one of constant curvature (as I
understand it the approach presented here is the Lagrangian dual of his
approach).

The idea is to suppose you have a topological triangulation of a three
manifold, let @xmath be the possible dihedral angle data such that the
sum of the angles about an edge is @xmath and such that the data can be
used to produce a hyperbolic simplex. Call the dihedral angles value at
@xmath in @xmath @xmath . Now we can deform our angle taking the span of
the transformations @xmath which adds one unit of angle to @xmath as
subtracts one unit form @xmath , for neighboring simplexes @xmath and
@xmath . Let @xmath be the angles geometrically equivalent to @xmath .

On @xmath we can now place the energy

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the sum is over all the simplexes @xmath and @xmath is the
hyperbolic volume of @xmath relative to @xmath ’s angles data.

Now, as in the the two-dimensional discrete case, the critical points of
this energy are a sets of simplexes which fit together. To see this we
recall Schafli’s formula which tells us

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is edge length of @xmath .

So at a critical point we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Unlike in the two dimensional case we fail to have good boundary control
(or Casson would have already uniformized the manifolds of interest). In
particular simplexes may collapse and enough collapsing may take place
that even the topological type of the complex could change. This is
where the randomizing may help.

##### 3.0.2 From the Discrete to the Continuous

Now just as before we randomly Delaunay triangulate. We use a Poisson
point process to distribute the points and then assign a simplex to a
quadruple on a small enough sphere passing through the four points which
is empty of other points. With high probability this complex will form a
triangulation. However not as canonically as in the two dimensional
case, since there are no natural geometric simplexes and faces only
natural edges and vertices.

For any set of vertices forming a triangulation we can construct a point
in some @xmath , just as in the discrete case. It is essential to note
that while we have no faces and hence no dihedral angles, we have
dihedral angles at both end points (using the geodesic directions) so
can average them and form the angle data of some @xmath in some @xmath .
So we may use the energy to once again form a random variable which can
be computed.

##### 3.0.3 Continuous Uniformization

Just as in the two dimensional case we may now use

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

to form an energy on the space of metrics. Currently not much is known
about this energy, but the hope of course is that it will form an energy
with which the techniques of section 10 can be carried out.

In the end hopefully one will be able to see that a three manifold
admitting a metric of variable negative sectional curvature will accept
one of constant negative sectional curvature.

## Chapter \thechapter The Discrete Uniformization Theorem

This chapter is dedicated to proving the generalization of the
Thurston-Andreev theorem mentioned in the introduction. It is presented
in a potentially strange order from the point of view of presentation in
section 2 . In section 4 the details of the energy argument presented in
2.1 are given ending in a theorem giving conditions under which triangle
angles in a topological triangular decomposition can be conformally
deformed to the angles of a geodesic triangular decomposition of a
hyperbolic surface. Also in this section a connection between the disk
patterns mentioned in section 2.1 and certain hyperbolic polyhedra is
explored and exploited.

In section 5 we explore the linear part of the discussion in section 2.1
, and prove a warm up case of the general ideal convex Thurston-Andreev
theorem. This warm up case is theorem 1 form the introduction including
the possibility of @xmath having boundary and has as an immediate
consequence the teleportation lemma (lemma 2 ). In section 6 the general
convex ideal case of the Thurston-Andreev theorem is presented and dealt
with.

### 4 The Triangular Decomposition Theorem

#### 4.1 Statement and Notation

Throughout this paper @xmath will denote a compact two-dimensional
surface with @xmath . By geometry I will mean a hyperbolic structure.
Uniqueness of geometries, triangulations and disk patterns is of course
up to isometry.

The main theorem in this section really should be stated for the
following structure which generalizes the notion of triangulation.

###### Definition 1

Let a triangular decomposition, @xmath , be a cell decomposition of
@xmath that lifts to a triangulation in @xmath ’s universal cover.

We will keep track of the combinatorics of such a decomposition by
denoting the vertices as @xmath , the edges as @xmath and the triangles
as @xmath . For convenience I will let @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath
denote both the set of edges, vertices, and faces and the cardinalities
of these sets. Similarly for the subsets of @xmath and @xmath contained
in @xmath possible boundary, denoted @xmath and @xmath . Let @xmath
denote the set of edges on the surface in a collection of triangles
@xmath , and let @xmath denote all the edges associated to a vertex
@xmath as if counted in the universal cover. The set of triangles
containing a vertex @xmath has the special name of the flower at @xmath
.

Note that in a triangular decomposition there are @xmath slots @xmath in
which one can insert possible triangle angles, which we will place an
order on and identify with a basis of a @xmath dimensional real vector
space. With this basis choice we will denote this vector space as @xmath
, and denote vectors in it as @xmath . Further more let @xmath be a dual
vector such that @xmath . With this we will view the angle at the slot
@xmath as @xmath . It is rarely necessary to use this notation and
instead to use the actual geometry. We will denote a vector by placing
the @xmath coefficients in a copy of the triangulation with dashed lines
and covector will contain its coefficients @xmath in a copy of the
triangular decomposition with solid lines. Thick lines will always
denote a boundary edge, as in lower left corner of vector and covector
in figure 4 . If in the picture we mean the non-specified values to be
arbitrary we will surround the picture with a loop (see the vector in
figure 4 ) and if we mean the non-specified values to be zero the
picture will not be surrounded (see the covector in figure 4 ). The
pairing of a vector and a covector denoted @xmath can be viewed
geometrically by placing the copy of the triangular decomposition
corresponding to the vector on top of the triangular decomposition
corresponding to the covector and multiplying the numbers living in the
same angle slots to arrive at @xmath (see figure 5 ). For a triangle
@xmath containing the angle slots @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath let
@xmath and call @xmath the angle data associated to @xmath .

In order to live on an actual nonsingular geometric surface all such
angles should be required to live in the subset of @xmath where the
angles at an interior vertex sum to @xmath and the angles at a boundary
vertex sum to @xmath . Let @xmath be the covector living in the flower
at @xmath defined as in figure 6 , this encourages us to choose our
possible angles in the affine flat

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

To further limit down the possible angle values we define the covector
@xmath as in figure 7

and note by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

would be the curvature in a geodesic triangle with angle data @xmath .
We will now isolate the open convex subset of @xmath where the curvature
is negative and all angles are realistic.

###### Definition 2

Let an angle system be a point in

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Note the actual angle data of a geodesic triangulation of a surface with
negative curvature has its angle data living in this set.

Observe that from any set of triangle data @xmath with the angles in
@xmath and @xmath we may associate an actual hyperbolic triangle, call
this triangle @xmath . Suppose the triangles in @xmath fit together in
the sense that all the corresponding edges are the same lengths. Then
@xmath being a triangular decomposition implies every open flower is
embedded in @xmath ’s universal cover and when the edge lengths all
agree this flower can be given a hyperbolic structure which is
consistent on flower over laps. So we have formed a hyperbolic structure
on @xmath .

###### Definition 3

Call an angle system @xmath uniform if all the hyperbolic realizations
of the triangles in @xmath fit together to form a hyperbolic structure
on @xmath . Let @xmath denote the the geodesic triangular decomposition
corresponding to @xmath and @xmath . Further more let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In section 2.4 we will attempt to take a point in @xmath and deform it
into a point of @xmath . Such deformations are located in an affine
space and I will call them conformal deformations (see the introduction
to section 2 to motivate this terminology). To describe this affine
space for each edge @xmath construct a vector @xmath as in figure 8 .

###### Definition 4

A conformal deformation will be a vector in

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and call @xmath and @xmath conformally equivalent if @xmath .

The first thing worth noting is that if @xmath and @xmath is conformally
equivalent to @xmath then as an immediate consequence of geometrically
pairing the covector in figure 6 with the vector in figure 8 we have for
@xmath that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

so @xmath is also in @xmath . Similarly for @xmath .

To combinatorially understand the points in @xmath which we may
conformally deform into uniform structures it is useful to express a
particularly nasty set in the boundary of @xmath .

###### Definition 5

Let @xmath be called a legal with respect to @xmath if @xmath yet either
@xmath or for some @xmath we have @xmath . Let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We will prove the following theorem.

###### Theorem 7

If there a uniform angle system conformally equivalent to @xmath then it
is unique, and for any angle system @xmath with @xmath empty there
exists a conformally equivalent uniform angle system.

Much of what takes place here relies on certain basic invariants of
conformal deformations. To describe them for each triangle @xmath and
@xmath we form the covector @xmath as in figure 9 . For each edge @xmath
we will denote @xmath as @xmath while for each edge @xmath associated
with triangles @xmath and @xmath we will let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We will call the @xmath covector the formal angle defect at @xmath . Let
the formal intersection angle be determined by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

when @xmath . and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

when @xmath .

Looking at the pairing between a covector @xmath and the vectors
spanning @xmath in figure 8 , we see if @xmath is conformally equivalent
to @xmath then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and indeed for each relevant edge @xmath we see @xmath and @xmath are
conformal invariants.

It is worth noting the trivial but extremely useful fact that the
curvature assumption gives us some control of the angle discrepancy.

###### Fact 1

When @xmath we have @xmath , and when @xmath we have @xmath .

Proof:

Let @xmath and note since @xmath and @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The boundary statement follows from the possibility of these
inequalities becoming equalities. q.e.d

As we shall see, the fundamental reason why the above triangulation
theorem is related to circle patterns and polyhedra construction is that
at a uniform angle system @xmath can be geometrically interpreted as the
intersection angle of the circumscribing circles of two hyperbolic
triangles meeting along @xmath .

Equivalently @xmath will be realized as the dihedral angle at an edge of
a polyhedra in the class @xmath corresponding to @xmath . It’s high time
to describe this class @xmath .

#### 4.2 Polyhedra in the Class @xmath

In this section we will construct and examine a bit of the geometry of
the infinite sided ideal polyhedra that will arise in the proof of
theorem 7 . These polyhedra can be constructed out of building blocks
each in the form of an ideal prism.

###### Definition 6

Place a given @xmath on a copy of @xmath . Let @xmath be the convex hull
of the set consisting of @xmath unioned with the geodesics perpendicular
to this @xmath going through @xmath ’s vertices. See figure 10 .

Given a triangular decomposition and uniform angle system @xmath let
@xmath denote the lift of @xmath to @xmath . With this notion we may now
construct the polyhedra in @xmath .

###### Definition 7

Let the class of polygons @xmath be those constructed by placing @xmath
on an @xmath and forming @xmath .

Notice abstractly a polyhedron @xmath in @xmath is an ideal polyhedra
symmetric upon the reflection through some plane upon which lives a
group of isometries forming a compact surface which when extended to
@xmath are isometries of @xmath .

Our first observation will be that if we happen to know a @xmath and
@xmath forming @xmath , then from this data we can easily construct the
dihedral angles. We will also refer to the dihedral angle associate to
an edge of @xmath , despite the fact there is always in fact a symmetric
pair of such angles.

###### Formula 6

If @xmath is constructed from @xmath and @xmath as in definition 7 then
the dihedral angle at an edge of @xmath associate to the edge @xmath of
@xmath is given by @xmath .

Proof: Note that the needed dihedral angle is the sum of the angles in
@xmath and @xmath corresponding to @xmath . It is these angles that will
be computed.

To do this simply note that @xmath can be decomposed as into three ideal
tetrahedra as in figure 11 , where @xmath with the angle slot containing
the @xmath coefficient across form @xmath . The labeled angles in the
figure 11 are the internal angles closest to the label.

Now use the fact that at the vertex of an ideal tetrahedron the angles
sum to @xmath , to form ten linear equations in the labeled unknowns.
Solving in terms of @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath one finds

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

as needed.

q.e.d

###### Note 1

The polygons in the surface with boundary case now are extremely
non-convex and have faces between the two hemispheres. Note that the
@xmath still represent the dihedral angles in these faces.

Let @xmath be a compact surface group extend form the @xmath through
which @xmath is symmetric and under which @xmath is invariant. To be in
the class @xmath such a group exists. When such a @xmath is chosen we
will be interested in the volume of @xmath . Notice given such a @xmath
we may choose a geodesic triangulation which descends to a triangular
decomposition @xmath of @xmath with an associated uniform structure
@xmath from which @xmath is constructed as in definition 7 . Using this
triangulation we have.

###### Formula 7

The volume of @xmath is @xmath where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with @xmath is the Lobacevskii function

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proof: First note the volume of @xmath can be reduced to the volumes of
individual @xmath by noting the volume is @xmath , where @xmath is the
volume of @xmath .

Its useful to get a formula for @xmath Recall if a tetrahedra has angles
@xmath , @xmath , and @xmath meeting at an ideal vertex then its volume
is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the Lobacevskii function.

In the proof of formula 6 we decomposed @xmath with @xmath into three
ideal tetrahedra, and found linear equations determining all the angles
in these ideal tetrahedra in terms of @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath . We
already wrote down the angle corresponding to @xmath and @xmath and can
further note

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Plugging these angles in the tetrahedra’s volume formula gives us the
needed formula.

q.e.d

Notice that when @xmath is constructed form @xmath and an edge @xmath of
@xmath is associate a dihedral angle @xmath that @xmath ’s edge
corresponding to @xmath is fake in the sense that the two triangular
faces meeting at this edge share the same polyhedron face. If a
polyhedra’s face is triangulated then a change in this triangulation
will not effect the polyhedra so it will turn out convenient to have
articulated the topological cell divisions which naturally arise form
polyhedra in @xmath .

###### Definition 8

Let a polygonation of a surface be a locally finite cell division such
that the closure of a cell is an embedded polygon and the intersection
of two polygons is empty, contains a single point, or contains one edge
and the two vertices associated to the edge. Let a polygonal
decomposition @xmath be a cell decomposition of a compact surface which
lifts to a polygonation in its universal cover.

To keep track of all the the combinatorics of such a cell division we
will use the same notation as we did for triangular decompositions.

At this point it is useful to name what turns out to be the appropriate
home of the possible dihedral angle assignments. Let @xmath be the set
of edges in a polygonal decomposition and just as we did with the angle
slots let them correspond to the the basis vectors of an @xmath
dimensional vector space, which we will denote @xmath with this basis
choice. We will be viewing this as the space of possible angle
discrepancies. Denote these vectors as @xmath .

Notice the @xmath were covectors in the previous section. We can
motivate this abuse of notation in the case that @xmath is triangular
decomposition by letting

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

be the linear mapping given by

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (7)
  -- -------- -- -----

and noting by the above lemma that we do indeed hit the dihedral angle
discrepancies when using a uniform angle system. As a further
justifiable abuse notation we let @xmath when @xmath and @xmath when
@xmath .

At this point it is convenient associate explicitly the data contained
in polyhedra in the class @xmath with certain disk patterns.

#### 4.3 Ideal Disk Patterns

In this section we will discuss the relation of these polyhedra to disk
patterns specified by combinatorial and topological data. The
topological data comes in the form of a polygonal decomposition @xmath
and the extra data associated to @xmath will be a point @xmath .

To begin to articulate the pattern here It’s necessary to define a
particularly nice polygonal decomposition.

###### Definition 9

A polygonal decomposition on a geometric surface is called
circumscribable if it is a geodesic polygonal decomposition where each
polygon is circumscribed by circle in @xmath ’s universal cover.

Given a circumscribable @xmath we may use a point @xmath to keep track
of all angles of intersection between the circumscribing circles of the
polygons meeting at @xmath (namely at @xmath this angle is @xmath ).
Simply to articulate the sense of angle to be used here it is convenient
to introduce @xmath which is a triangular decomposition associated to
@xmath by triangulating each polygon. It is occasionally useful to have
an explicit grip on this triangulation so we may assume that we
triangulate each polygon with a fan as in figure 13 . Note this
triangulation can be chosen to be a geodesic triangulation if @xmath is
circumscribable, since all the polygons are then convex. Also if we are
given a @xmath relative to @xmath we will let @xmath be the angle
discrepancy assignment on @xmath which is @xmath on the the edges of
@xmath and @xmath on the new edges, and hence corresponds to
geodesically triangulating a circumscribable decomposition.

Note given a uniform structure @xmath associated to @xmath that every
edge sits between two triangles @xmath and @xmath , and the sense of the
angle used here can be chosen relative to these geodesic triangles. Let
the intersection angle @xmath be a number in @xmath if the vertex of
@xmath not on @xmath is out side @xmath ’s circumscribing disk, in
@xmath if this vertex is in @xmath ’s circumscribing disk, and exactly
@xmath when this vertex is on @xmath ’s circumscribing circle.

###### Definition 10

Let an ideal disk pattern be a collection distinct disks on a geometric
surface whose boundary circles are in one to one correspondence with the
circumscribing circles of a circumscribable polygonal decomposition.
Notice in such a situation using a @xmath we naturally have the
triangles needed to associate @xmath to keep track intersection angles
at each of the polygonal decomposition’s edges.

The pattern problem is given a topological polygonal decomposition and a
suitable @xmath to assert the existence and uniqueness of an ideal disk
pattern. Such assertion are equivalent to such assertions about
polyhedra in the class @xmath .

###### Observation 3

Every ideal disk pattern can be associated a unique polyhedra in @xmath
. The polyhedra associated to a pattern is convex if and only if @xmath
, in which case we will also call the pattern convex. To each polyhedra
in @xmath and choice of @xmath as described preceding formula 7 there is
a uniquely associated ideal disk pattern. Furthermore under these
correspondences the dihedral angle of the polyhedra associated to an
edge @xmath is precisely the intersection angle between the
circumscribing circles of the polygons sharing @xmath in the ideal disk
pattern.

Proof: Note that given a circumscribable polygonal decomposition that we
may form a geodesic triangular decomposition @xmath which can be
associated an element of @xmath via the construction in definition 7 .
Similarly given an element @xmath in @xmath and a @xmath as in the
discussion preceding formula 7 we know there is a geodesic triangulation
invariant under @xmath which descends to a geodesic triangular
decomposition of @xmath . Let @xmath be the circumscribable
decomposition formed by ignoring the edges where @xmath .

To see the angle correspondence we will recall a map from a specified
@xmath to the upper half of the sphere at infinity @xmath (using the
usual conformal structure of the sphere at infinity) which sends circles
in @xmath to circles in @xmath . To form this map send a point in this
fixed @xmath to where the geodesic perpendicular to this @xmath hits
@xmath (as in figure 14 ). Note any circle can be sent to what we view
as the center of @xmath via a hyperbolic isometry preserving @xmath ,
were by symmetry it is sent under this mapping to a circle at infinity.
This isometry bringing the circle to what we view as the center induces
a Mobius transformation on the sphere at infinity and preserves the set
of geodesics used to form this map’s image - so the fact that Mobius
transformations send circle to circles on @xmath now gives us that
indeed the image of any circle is a circle.

So a neighboring pair triangles @xmath and @xmath have circumscribing
circles in @xmath sent under this map sent to circles at infinity
intersecting at the same angle and going through the ideal points of the
neighboring @xmath and @xmath . But these circles at infinity are also
the intersection of @xmath with the spheres representing the hyperbolic
planes forming the top faces of @xmath and @xmath . So the intersection
angle of these spheres is precisely the dihedral angle, which is now
seen to be the intersection angle of the circles on the sphere at
infinity, or finally the original intersection angle of the
circumscribing circles.

The convexity assertion can be seen immediately by looking at the two
neighboring @xmath prism’s.

q.e.d

At this this point there are two natural questions about such patterns
and polyhedra, namely when they exist are they unique and are there nice
way to insure existence? The first question will be answered in the next
section with the following fact: a pattern/polyhedra is determined
uniquely by its/an associated topological polygonal decomposition @xmath
and @xmath . The existence issue will be handled in sections 5 and 6.2
where necessary and sufficient conditions for @xmath relative to @xmath
to be associated to a convex pattern/polyhedron with this given data
will be presented.

With respect to these existence and uniqueness results I will only deal
with the terminology of ideal disk patterns from here on out.

#### 4.4 Proof of Theorem 7

Now we will prove theorem 7 . The proof relies on the energy introduced
in section 2.1 which lives on @xmath , and which at a uniform @xmath
agrees with the volume of @xmath with @xmath constructed from @xmath as
in definition 7 and @xmath the surface group associated to @xmath . We
may assume we that either @xmath is a triangulation or form it we have
constructed the triangulation @xmath , so we will denote in @xmath .

Let the energy be the of the volume of the abstract disjoint union
@xmath given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since hyperbolic objects optimize at fat objects we will be maximizing
this energy, and I suppose to call this an energy (in the physical
sense) I really should negate it. However I like both the fact that
hyperbolic objects like to be fat and the term energy, so I will simply
warn the reader about this odd terminology. Note we get an explicit
description of the energy from formula 7 . Using this formula we can
differentiate to find @xmath ’s differential, @xmath . As usual for a
function in a linear space like @xmath we use translation to identify
the tangent and cotangent spaces at every point with @xmath and @xmath
and express our differentials in the chosen basis. From the formula for
the Lobacheski function we have @xmath with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath . After a little bit of trigonometry
this can be simplified to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

To compute further let @xmath , @xmath and @xmath denote the edge
lengths opposite to the angles @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath respectively
in the hyperbolic triangle determined by @xmath . From elementary
hyperbolic geometry we know that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

allowing us to simplify @xmath to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

So plugging this in the above formula we arrive at…

###### Formula 8

@xmath with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and the @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath
determined as above.

Now let’s look at the conformal class of a point @xmath , and define

###### Definition 11

Let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and call it the conformal class of @xmath .

Recall that @xmath from definition 4 . Let @xmath be the edge between
@xmath and @xmath with @xmath , @xmath corresponding to the angle slot
across from @xmath in @xmath , and the @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath
determined as above. Then we may observe…

###### Observation 4

From the above formula and the description of @xmath a critical point
@xmath of the energy when restricted to @xmath ’s conformal class
satisfies

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for all edges @xmath . Hence at such a critical point we have that
@xmath and @xmath is a uniform angle system.

With this observation the the existence and uniqueness of such critical
points is equivalent to the existence and uniqueness of uniform
structures conformal to a fixed one. In particular we may prove the
uniqueness assertion in theorem 7 .

###### Lemma 4

If @xmath contains a uniform angle system this angle system is unique in
@xmath .

Proof: This will follow form the fact @xmath is concave down. What we
are really asking for is that the energy’s Hessian is negative in the
@xmath directions at all points in @xmath . In fact we will show
something considerablely stronger, namely that the Hessian is negative
throughout all of the open subset of @xmath satisfying @xmath ’s open
condition and in all of @xmath ’s directions. (A fact which has several
interesting application to the production of triangulations with special
symmetries.) Note that in this setting @xmath and hence its Hessian
splits up into a sum of independent functions associated to each
triangle - so we only need to show the @xmath matrix corresponding to a
fixed triangle is negative definite. Assume we are in the triangle with
angle slots @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath and @xmath . Recalling that a
linear change of coordinate will not effect whether the Hessian is
negative definite or not, I found it useful to use the coordinates
@xmath for this computation. To write down the Hessian in these
coordinates it is use full to introduce the functions

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

With these named a direct computation shows

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

To see this matrix is negative definite we can use the following easily
derived condition: a symmetric 3 by 3 matrix @xmath is negative definite
if @xmath , @xmath , and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Note through out this computation that the assumption that @xmath or
rather @xmath implies all the @xmath functions are evaluated at positive
angle less than @xmath and all the @xmath functions are evaluated at
sums of angle of absolute value less than @xmath ; so all such
evaluations are positive. In particular the negative sign outside
guarantees that all terms in the matrix, including the needed @xmath
term, are negative.

Now we need to satisfy the remaining two conditions; namely we’d like

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

to be positive, which by the observations made above it is.

As well as needing

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

to be positive which once again as observed above is true.

So indeed the volumes Hessian is negative definite throughout the open
subset of @xmath satisfying @xmath ’s open conditions.

q.e.d

From this we will be able to show the uniqueness statement claimed in
the previous section.

###### Corollary 1

An ideal disk pattern is uniquely determined by its topological
ploygonal decomposition and associated angle discrepancy system @xmath .
An ideal disk pattern can be constructed form a polygonal decomposition
@xmath and associated angle discrepancy system @xmath precisely when
there is a critical point of @xmath in @xmath .

Proof: Notice the choice of triangulation in forming @xmath from @xmath
at this step is irrelevant for both uniqueness and existence, since in
an actual pattern any edges with a @xmath will not be included in the
polygonal decomposition’s description.

Using such a triangular decomposition note @xmath has rank @xmath since
the pairing of @xmath with the vector @xmath in figure 15 satisfies
@xmath for each @xmath . Further note from section 2.1 that the null
space contains the @xmath dimension space @xmath and is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

dimensional - so @xmath is precisely the null space. In particular all
angle systems which could conceivably hit a specified set of discrepancy
angles @xmath is in @xmath , which is @xmath for some @xmath . So the
above lemma gaurentees the uniqueness and existence of the geodesic
triangulation necessary to construct the ideal disk pattern under the
above conditions.

q.e.d

Now its time to explore the existence of critical points. Given a
pre-compact open set @xmath and a continuous function @xmath on @xmath
we automatically achieve a maximum. For this maximum to be a critical
point it is enough to know that @xmath is differentiable in @xmath and
that the point of maximal @xmath is in the open set @xmath .

One way to achieve this is to show that for any boundary point @xmath
that there is a direction @xmath , an @xmath and a @xmath such that
@xmath satisfies

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for all @xmath . This works because under these hypothesize @xmath is
continuous and increasing on @xmath and @xmath certainly could not have
been a point where @xmath achieved its maximum.

It is useful to note that the compactness of @xmath gaurentees us that
@xmath eventually hits the boundary again at @xmath for some @xmath . So
we may change the speed of our line and assume

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is the line connecting the two boundary points. So the remainder of
theorem 7 follows by applying this above criteria to @xmath and @xmath
and noting…

###### Lemma 5

For every pair of points @xmath and @xmath in @xmath but not in @xmath
with @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proof: By using @xmath and the previous lemma’s notation for the angles
in a triangle @xmath , we can write the equation for the dual of @xmath
’s coefficient @xmath in formula 4 as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Fixing a triangle @xmath let @xmath ; and note with this notation that
the contribution to @xmath coming from the triangle @xmath is given as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since @xmath is on the boundary of @xmath and not in @xmath there is
some triangle @xmath such that @xmath however either @xmath or some
angle is zero.

We will show that for any triangle @xmath in this case @xmath . Its
useful to divide the possibilities into the following three cases.

1.  Where @xmath contains zeros but @xmath .

2.  Where @xmath and no angle is zero.

3.  Where @xmath and one angle in @xmath is zero.

In the first case note that the only pieces of @xmath which become
infinite are of the form @xmath and further note that if @xmath and
@xmath then @xmath . So we indeed have @xmath as required.

To understand the second case note that if @xmath tends to zero then
then we may rewrite @xmath as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

From this we find the part of @xmath that is not bounded is in the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Further note when @xmath and @xmath that @xmath . So once again we have
@xmath as required.

The final case is a combination of the above two were we find the part
of @xmath that is not bounded is in the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The arguments above immediately imply the correct derivative behavior.

Now note that @xmath is clearly bounded on triangles with angles not not
satisfying any boundary conditions, hence if it were bounded or @xmath
on triangles where @xmath we would be done. The whole reason the @xmath
is bad set is that it is in fact finite. Using the same argument as
above and Taylor expanding you find

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with @xmath bounded.

So the proof is complete. q.e.d

### 5 A Warm Up Thurston-Andreev Theorem

In this section we will prove a warm up Thurston Andreev theorem. This
section and the next have been made independent of each other so there
is a bit of repetition.

Corollary 4 tells us that an ideal disk pattern is always unique when it
exists, and we are now left to deal with the dilemma of finding good
existence criteria. Here I will describe in detail the strict convex
case where @xmath relative to @xmath a triangular decomposition. Linear
conditions on the possible @xmath will be produced which are necessary
and sufficient for the @xmath relative to @xmath to be the data of an
ideal disk pattern.

Let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and call this the set of negative curvature Delaunay angle systems.
These angle systems are remarkably easy to work with such angle systems
and in fact…

###### Observation 5

Every point of @xmath has unique ideal disk pattern associated to it.

Proof: This observation relies on the following fact which will be of
interest in its own right.

###### Fact 2

If @xmath is conformally equivalent to a point in @xmath where for some
triangle @xmath .

To see this fact assume to the contrary that for some @xmath and @xmath
we have @xmath . Let @xmath be the edge of @xmath across form @xmath ’s
@xmath and let @xmath be @xmath ’s neighbor next to @xmath if it exists.
Note by fact 3 that that the conformally invariant @xmath would (even in
the best possible case when @xmath is not on the boundary) have to
satisfy the contradictory inequality @xmath .

From this fact we have that if @xmath then no element in @xmath could
possibly be in @xmath and the observation follows form theorem 7 .

q.e.d

Now lets explore certain two necessary conditions on a @xmath with
@xmath . The first condition is the condition related to the fact that
the angles at the internal vertex in a geometric triangulation sum to
@xmath and at a boundary vertex sum to @xmath .

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This condition is equivalent to the following simple lemma.

###### Lemma 6

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proof: First note that if @xmath then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

So by choosing @xmath we see @xmath is included in

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Recall form the proof of corollary 1 that @xmath . So we may express any
@xmath as @xmath and the above computation gaurentees @xmath as needed.

q.e.d

The second necessary condition is a global one; namely an insistence
that for every set @xmath of @xmath triangles in @xmath that

  -- -------- -- -------- --
     @xmath      @xmath   
  -- -------- -- -------- --

Verifying @xmath relies on the following formula.

###### Formula 9

Given a set of triangles @xmath

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

with the @xmath in @xmath term being the triangle on the non- @xmath
side of @xmath .

Proof:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with the @xmath in @xmath term being the triangle on the non- @xmath
side of @xmath . Substituting the definition of @xmath gives the needed
formula.

q.e.d

Note for any point @xmath that @xmath and form fact 3 that @xmath . So
removing these terms form the above formula strictly reduces its size
and when summed up we arrive at @xmath .

With these two necessary condition we have our first pattern existence
theorem:

###### Theorem 8

If

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

then @xmath is realized by a unique ideal disk pattern.

By observation 5 above this would follow if we knew the following
proposition.

###### Proposition 1

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It is this bit of linear algebra we now will tackle. Notice the fact
@xmath and @xmath are necessary gaurentees that @xmath , and we left to
explore @xmath ’s surjectivity.

#### 5.1 The Surjectivity of @xmath: the Delaunay Case

To see the surjectivity of @xmath let’s assume the contrary that that
@xmath is strictly contained in @xmath and produce a contradiction. With
this assumption we have a point @xmath on the boundary of @xmath inside
@xmath . Note @xmath for some @xmath . Furthermore note @xmath is empty,
since other wise for some @xmath we would have @xmath which along with
the fact that @xmath is an open mapping when restricted to @xmath would
force @xmath to be in the interior of @xmath .

At this point we need to choose a particularly nice conformal version of
@xmath , which requires the notion of a stable boundary point of @xmath
. Before defining stability note since @xmath is a convex set with
hyperplane boundary if @xmath such that @xmath , then @xmath is its self
a convex @xmath dimensional set.

###### Definition 12

A point in @xmath is stable if @xmath and @xmath is in the interior of
@xmath as a @xmath dimensional set. Any inequality forming @xmath
violated in order to make @xmath a boundary point will be called a
violation.

The key property of a stable point is that a conformal change @xmath has
@xmath for all @xmath or for some sufficiently small @xmath we have
@xmath must still be on @xmath and experience exactly the same
violations as @xmath . The impossibility of any other phenomena when
conformally changing a stable point is at the heart of the arguments in
lemma 7 and lemma 8 below. At this point subjectivity would follow if
for a stable @xmath we knew that @xmath could not be in @xmath ,
contradicting the choice of @xmath as needed.

We will prove this by splitting up the possibilities into the two cases
in lemma 7 and lemma 8 .

###### Lemma 7

If @xmath is stable and @xmath for @xmath in a triangle where @xmath ,
then @xmath is not in @xmath .

Proof: Look at an angle slot which is zero in triangle @xmath satisfying
@xmath . View this angle as living between the edges @xmath and @xmath .
Note that in order for @xmath to be stable that either @xmath is a
boundary edge or the @xmath transformation (with its positive side in
@xmath ) must be protected by a zero on the @xmath side forcing the
condition that @xmath , or else for small enough @xmath we would have
@xmath would be a conformally equivalent point on @xmath with fewer
violations. When @xmath is not a boundary edge call this neighboring
triangle @xmath and when it is a boundary edge stop this process. If we
have not stopped let @xmath be another edge bounding a zero angle slot
in @xmath and stop if it is a boundary edge. If it is not a boundary
edge then there are two possibilities. If @xmath repeat the above
procedure letting @xmath play the role of @xmath and @xmath the role of
@xmath and constructing an @xmath in a triangle @xmath . If @xmath
conformally change @xmath to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Notice no triangle with @xmath can have two zeros by fact 2 , so for the
initial zero violation to exist there most be a zero on the @xmath side
of @xmath . Once again we have determined an @xmath and @xmath .

Using this procedure to make our decisions we may continue this process
forming a set of edges @xmath with the angle between @xmath and @xmath ,
@xmath , always equal to zero. Since there are a finite number of edges
either we stop at a boundary edge or eventually in this sequence will
have some @xmath such that @xmath and @xmath . (This by the pigeon hole
principle since some edge @xmath will appear an infinite number of times
in this list and among its infinite neighbors there must be a repeat).

In the case the sequence never stops we can produce a contradiction. To
do it first note if @xmath and @xmath are in @xmath then @xmath . So for
the set of edges @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

our needed contradiction.

In the case the sequence did hit the boundary perform the construction
in the opposite direction. If we don’t stop in this direction we arrive
at the same contradiction. If we did then this computation still
produces a contradiction on the path with the two boundary edges, since
for a boundary edge in the triangle @xmath we have @xmath .

q.e.d

###### Lemma 8

If a stable @xmath satisfies the condition that if @xmath then @xmath is
in a triangle @xmath with @xmath , then @xmath is not in @xmath .

Proof: In this case, in order for @xmath to be a boundary point of
@xmath for some @xmath we have that @xmath . We will be looking at the
nonempty set of all triangles with @xmath , @xmath . The first
observation needed about @xmath is that it is not all of @xmath and has
a non-empty internal boundary (meaning @xmath ). To see this note

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

so there is negative curvature somewhere.

By the stability of @xmath once again there can be no conformal
transformation capable of moving negative curvature into this set.
Suppose we are at an internal boundary @xmath edge of @xmath , call the
triangle on the @xmath side of the boundary edge @xmath and the triangle
on the non-boundary edge @xmath . Since @xmath has negative curvature
the obstruction to the @xmath transformation being able to move
curvature out of @xmath must be due to @xmath . In order for @xmath to
protect against this there must be zero along @xmath on the @xmath side.

Now we will continue the attempt to suck curvature out with a curvature
vacuum. Such a vacuum is an element of @xmath indexed by a set of @xmath
edges. The key observation in forming this vacuum is once again fact 2
telling us if an angle in @xmath is zero and @xmath then there is only
one zero angle in @xmath . Let @xmath be the other edge sharing the
unique zero angle along @xmath in @xmath and if @xmath is another
boundary edge we stop. If @xmath is not a boundary edge use @xmath to
continue the effort to remove curvature. Continuing this process forms a
completely determined set of edges and triangles, @xmath and @xmath ,
and a sequence of conformal transformations @xmath .

We will now get some control over this vacuum. Note a vacuum never hits
itself since if there is a first pair @xmath such that @xmath then
@xmath would have to have to have two zero and zero curvature, which
fact 2 assures us is impossible. So any vacuum hits a boundary edge or
pokes through @xmath into @xmath .

In fact with this argument we can arrive at the considerablely sponger
fact that two vacuums can never even share an edge. To see this call a
vacuum’s side boundary any edge of a triangle in the vacuum facing a
zero. Now simply note if the intersection of two vacuums contains an
edge then it contains a first edge @xmath with respect to one of the
vacuums. There are two possibilities for this edge. One is that @xmath
has two zeros and @xmath , which we showed was impossible in the
previous paragraph. The other is that @xmath is a side boundary of both
vacuums. In this case we have an edge facing zero angles in both
directions in triangle with zero curvature, so this would force @xmath ,
a contradiction. So either case is impossible, and indeed no distinct
vacuums share an edge.

Let @xmath be the removal from @xmath of all these vacuums. First I’d
like to note that @xmath is non-empty. Note every vacuum has side
boundary. Since vacuums cannot intersect themselves or share edges with
distinct vacuums, @xmath would be nonempty if side boundary had to be in
@xmath ’s interior. Look at any side boundary edge @xmath of a fixed
vacuum. Note @xmath cannot be on @xmath since then the vacuum triangle
it belonged to would have at least two zeros and @xmath . Furthermore
@xmath cannot be on @xmath since then @xmath . So indeed @xmath is
nonempty.

Now lets observe the following formula.

###### Formula 10

Given a set of triangles @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with the @xmath in @xmath term being the triangle on the non- @xmath
side of @xmath .

Proof:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

q.e.d

Now every edge in @xmath faces a zero on its @xmath side in a triangle
with @xmath , so

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Similarly each triangle has zero curvature so from the above formula we
have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

violating condition @xmath . So we have constructed a violation to
@xmath and @xmath cannot be in @xmath as need.

q.e.d

It is worth noting that nothing prevents us from extending the main
theorem of this section (and the next) to the case were @xmath and in
particular to the version of this theorem where @xmath and the resulting
uniform surface is a finite area hyperbolic surface with cusps.

### 6 The Ideal Thurston-Andreev Theorem

In this section we prove and sate the general ideal convex
Thurston-Andreev theorem, which is simply the polygonal decomposition
case of the theorem of the previous section. The proof here is done in
detail when the surface has no boundary, and dealing with the boundary
can be accomplished exactly as in the previous section.

#### 6.1 The Statement and Reduction to Linear Algebra

Corollary 4 tells us that an ideal disk pattern is always unique when it
exists, and we are now left to deal with the dilemma of finding good
existence criteria. In fact in the convex case, (when @xmath relative to
@xmath ) we will produce linear conditions on the possible @xmath which
are necessary and sufficient for the @xmath relative to @xmath to be the
data of an ideal disk pattern.

The first example of a necessary condition on @xmath is the condition
related to the fact that the angles at the vertex in a geometric
triangulation sum to @xmath , namely

  -- -------- -- -------- --
     @xmath      @xmath   
  -- -------- -- -------- --

This and all the mentioned necessary condition will be demonstrated as
such in the next section. Another necessary condition is a global one
(though often localizable), namely an insistence that for every set
@xmath of @xmath polygons in @xmath that

  -- -------- -- -------- --
     @xmath      @xmath   
  -- -------- -- -------- --

With these two necessary condition we have our first pattern existence
theorem:

###### Theorem 9

That @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath hold is necessary and sufficient for
@xmath relative to @xmath to be associated to a unique convex ideal disk
pattern.

###### Note 2

This theorem works equally well for surfaces with boundary. The only
modifications is the obvious one that at a boundary vertex @xmath .

Such pattern data is extremely common; for example the data determined
by the circumscribing circles in any random Delaunay triangulation of a
varying negative curvature surface (see section 2 ). This fact is the
main reason I’ve chosen to use the terminology of the disk pattern
construction rather than polyhedra construction in this section.

One way to prove theorem 9 allows some understanding of the non-convex
case as well. Namely we will find some necessary criteria on angles when
@xmath . In order to articulate these conditions we need certain snake
and a loop concepts in a triangular decomposition.

###### Definition 13

A snake is a finite directed sequence of edges @xmath directed in the
following sense: if @xmath we start with the edge @xmath between @xmath
and @xmath , then we require @xmath to be one of the remaining edges on
@xmath . Then letting @xmath be the other face associated to @xmath we
require @xmath to be one of the other edges of @xmath and so on until
some tail edge @xmath and tail face @xmath are reached, and if @xmath we
reverse the procedure and add rather than subtract from the index. See
figure 16 for examples. A loop is a snake @xmath where @xmath and @xmath
, see figure 17 for a pair of examples.

It is a condition on snakes and loops which allows one to articulate the
remaining necessary conditions. However as defined there are then an
infinite number of such objects and it nice to first isolate a finite
sub-set that does the job.

###### Definition 14

A set of edges @xmath is called embedded if @xmath . A snake @xmath is
said to double back on itself if we have a pair of non-empty sub-snakes
with @xmath and @xmath containing the same edges. A barbell is a loop
which doubles back on itself and such that @xmath is embedded. A balloon
is a snake which doubles back on itself with @xmath embedded and such
that @xmath .

With this terminology the remaining necessary conditions are

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

and

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

With these conditions let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

To each ideal disk pattern we may produce an uniform element of a @xmath
by choosing a geodesic @xmath associated to the patterns circumscribing
@xmath . So the above necessary conditions would follow if @xmath . In
fact in the next section we shall prove….

###### Theorem 10

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

With this result we are in a position to prove theorem 9 .

Poof of theorem 9 from theorem 10 : First we will show that @xmath
relative to a chosen @xmath (where we assume polygons have been
triangulated as in figure 13 ). To do this we need that conditions
@xmath and @xmath are satisfied. Since @xmath is automatic and @xmath
can only be false if there is a loop or barbell @xmath on which @xmath .
Note that by our choice of @xmath (though any other choice would in fact
still work with a slight modification) we see that the only snakes
@xmath containing all @xmath edges are snakes with edges contained in
some polygon’s fan and in particular can never loop up or form a
barbell. So by theorem 10 we see the point @xmath described in theorem 9
has a preimage which intersects @xmath non-trivially.

At this point all we need is that a point @xmath in this preimage @xmath
satisfies the conditions of theorem 7 . Namely we will suppose that
@xmath is not empty, i.e. @xmath with @xmath , and produce a
contradiction. In particular this assumption gaurentees there is some
triangle @xmath with @xmath . Let the edge @xmath of @xmath be the edge
with the @xmath of @xmath on it. The fact @xmath allows us to control
the @xmath data in the other triangle containing the edge @xmath . This
follows by observing the natural and what will prove be useful
decomposition of @xmath as in figure 18 , and the following trivial but
useful fact…

###### Fact 3

When @xmath we have @xmath , and when @xmath we have @xmath .

reason for the fact:

Let @xmath and note since @xmath and @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The second statement follows from the possibility of these inequalities
becoming equalities.

Back to the proof. From this fact we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

forces @xmath , and hence @xmath with the zero opposite to @xmath . Now
the assumption we are in @xmath implies @xmath is not legal and @xmath
or @xmath . Let @xmath be the @xmath edge @xmath and continue this
argument hence forming a snake of edges with @xmath . Note by finiteness
of the triangulation there must be a first @xmath and @xmath where
@xmath . Note when this happens that @xmath forms an embedded loop with
all its @xmath , contradicting condition @xmath .

So @xmath is indeed empty and we have our need triangulation, hence our
needed ideal disk pattern.

q.e.d

#### 6.2 Proof of Theorem 10

##### 6.2.1 Injectivity

Our first goal in proving theorem 10 is to show

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For starters note the fact @xmath follows immediately from fact 1 in the
previous section. Now we need to verify the conditions @xmath through
@xmath hold in @xmath . Condition @xmath is equivalent to the following
simple lemma.

###### Lemma 9

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proof: First recall that we know @xmath is surjective, so we may express
any @xmath as @xmath . L‘So letting @xmath denote the set of edges at a
vertex @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

So in particular the affine flat

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is precisely @xmath . q.e.d

Verifying condition @xmath relies on the following formula.

###### Formula 11

Given a set of triangles @xmath

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

with the @xmath in @xmath term being the triangle on the non- @xmath
side of @xmath .

Proof:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

q.e.d

Note for any point @xmath that @xmath and so with this and observation 1
we have @xmath and in particular condition @xmath is necessary.

@xmath and @xmath rely on certain a pair of related formulae.

###### Formula 12

Let @xmath be the angle slot between @xmath and @xmath in a snake @xmath
. We have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and if @xmath is a loop

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proof: Simply note both that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and sum up. q.e.d

The second formula immediately implies @xmath immediately, and from fact
1 we have @xmath allowing the first formula to demonstrate @xmath .

##### 6.2.2 Surjectivity

In this section we will finish the proof of theorem 10 by showing @xmath
maps @xmath onto @xmath . To do it let’s assume the contrary allowing
that that @xmath is strictly contained in @xmath and produce a
contradiction. With this assumption we have a point @xmath on the
boundary of @xmath inside @xmath . Note @xmath for some @xmath and that
@xmath empty, since other wise for some @xmath we would have @xmath
hence forcing by the openness of @xmath @xmath to be in the interior of
@xmath .

At this point we need to choose a particularly nice conformal version of
@xmath , which requires the notion of a stable boundary point of @xmath
. Before defining stability note since @xmath is a convex set with hyper
plane boundary if @xmath such that @xmath , then @xmath is its self a
convex @xmath dimensional set.

###### Definition 15

A point in @xmath is stable if @xmath and @xmath is in the interior of
@xmath as a @xmath dimensional set. Any inequality forming @xmath
violated in order to make a stable @xmath a boundary point will be
called a violation.

The key property of a stable point is that a conformal change @xmath has
@xmath for all @xmath or for some sufficiently small @xmath we have
@xmath must still be on @xmath and experience exactly the same
violations as @xmath . The impossibility of any other phenomena when
conformally changing a stable point is at the heart of the arguments in
lemma 10 and lemma 11 below. At this point subjectivity would follow if
for a stable @xmath we knew that @xmath could not be in @xmath ,
contradicting the choice of @xmath as needed.

We will prove this by splitting up the possibilities into the two cases
in lemma 10 and lemma 11 .

Before starting lets define …

###### Definition 16

The end of a snake @xmath is said to have a head with respect to @xmath
if @xmath with the pair of zeros located at the angle slots of @xmath
along @xmath .

###### Lemma 10

If @xmath is stable and @xmath for @xmath in a triangle where @xmath ,
then @xmath is not in @xmath .

Proof: I will suppose that @xmath and produce a violation to the @xmath
or @xmath conditions.

Now look at an angle slot which is zero in triangle @xmath satisfying
@xmath . View this angle as living between the edges @xmath and @xmath .
Note that in order for @xmath to be stable that the @xmath
transformation (with its positive side in @xmath ) must be protected by
a zero on the @xmath side forcing the condition that @xmath , or else
for small enough @xmath we have @xmath would be a conformally equivalent
point on @xmath with fewer violations. Call this neighboring triangle
@xmath . If we see a pair of zeros and a @xmath facing the @xmath from
@xmath we stop. Otherwise let @xmath be another edge bounding the zero
angle slot in @xmath and repeat the above procedure if @xmath . If
@xmath form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Note that the only way this construction could have difficulty is
precisely the case in which @xmath was a head - in which case we already
stopped.

So we may continue this process forming a snake @xmath with @xmath until
we hit a head. Notice we can also make the same construction in the
other direction.

Note as such if his snake formed a embedded loop, a barbell, an embedded
snake with two heads or a balloon with a head then the @xmath condition
would contradict one of the formulas in formula 12 , hence violating
@xmath or @xmath , and we would be done. It will be shown that one of
these cases must occur.

To produce the needed snakes note that by finiteness in the positive
direction there is a first time when some @xmath and @xmath or we
terminated at a head before such an over lap. If this sequence
terminated in a head look at the snake in the negative direction and if
it terminates in a head then we are done. If not we have the same
situation as the positive snake not terminating in a head, i.e. there is
a first @xmath when the one headed snake hits itself. If we hit the head
we have our needed embedded loop. If not we have two possibilities
either that @xmath can be chosen to be @xmath in which case we have our
need embedded loop or @xmath must be @xmath . In this case we can
reverse the construction going form @xmath to @xmath to form the needed
barbell.

Suppose in the positive direction we experienced our first moment when
for @xmath @xmath . Then as above if it hinges so @xmath can be chosen
to be @xmath we have our embedded loop. If not we will form a chain in
the opposite direction starting with @xmath . Now we are searching for
the first @xmath when @xmath hits @xmath at @xmath or hits some or
@xmath at @xmath or terminates in a head. If it terminates in a head we
can form our needed balloon as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If our snake hits itself at @xmath and @xmath can be chosen as @xmath we
once again get our needed embedded loop. If it hinges such that @xmath
must @xmath then we can double back to form our needed barbell

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The other possibility is that @xmath hits first @xmath at @xmath with
@xmath . As always there are two possibilities for how they hinge and in
either case we can form one of the following embedded loops

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

or

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

So in any case violation to @xmath or @xmath can be produced.

q.e.d

###### Lemma 11

If a stable @xmath satisfies the condition that if @xmath then @xmath is
in a triangle @xmath with @xmath , then @xmath is not in @xmath .

Proof: In order to be a boundary point of @xmath for some @xmath we have
that @xmath . We will be looking at the set of all triangles with @xmath
, @xmath , which is not all of @xmath and has a non-empty boundary To
see this note

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

so there is negative curvature somewhere.

By the stability of @xmath once again there can be no conformal
transformation capable of moving negative curvature into this set.
Suppose we are at a boundary edge of @xmath , call the triangle on the
@xmath side of the boundary edge @xmath and the triangle on the
non-boundary edge @xmath . Since @xmath has negative curvature (and
hence no @xmath angles) the obstruction to the @xmath transformation
being able to move curvature out of @xmath must be due to @xmath . In
order for @xmath to protect against this there must be zero along @xmath
in the @xmath side.

Now we will continue the attempt to suck curvature out with a curvature
vacuum. Such a vacuum is an element of @xmath indexed by a snake. The
first edge in the snake is the boundary edge @xmath . If in @xmath
@xmath faces a @xmath we stop. We say that we stopped at a head. If not
let @xmath be the other edge sharing the unique zero angle along @xmath
in @xmath and if @xmath is another boundary edge we stop. If @xmath is
not a boundary edge use @xmath to continue the effort to remove
curvature. Continuing this process @xmath steps forms a snake @xmath and
@xmath .

Suppose a vacuum hits its self and @xmath . Then we must have an extra
zero in @xmath in which case we have a @xmath . Note it is not a head
with respect to either direction and it fact now form a vacuum loop. In
the conformal change associated to this loop consistently changes the
angles with value @xmath to having value @xmath , a contradiction to
stability.

So any vacuum in fact pokes through @xmath into @xmath . In fact this
argument shows us something slightly stronger, namely if a vacuum hits a
triangle with @xmath then it is a head. If not after we poke through we
could still reduce the @xmath to @xmath conformally. This because under
the lemma’s hypothesis, there can be no zeros in @xmath protecting the
vacuum form consistently sucking.

From this note one vacuum can never pass through another since this
would force a @xmath triangle which is not a head for at least one of
the vacuums. Similarly the outside edges of a vacuum always face zero
angles in the vacuums and to be in @xmath two zeros can never face each
other since then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

So all the edges associated to distinct vacuums are distinct.

Now simply let @xmath be the removal from @xmath of all these vacuums.
If @xmath is non-empty then every boundary edge of this set faces a zero
in a triangle of zero curvature so formula 11 receives all zeros from
the boundary terms. Similarly each triangle having exactly zero
curvature gives us exactly a @xmath for each internal triangle in
formula 11 , so @xmath as needed to violate @xmath .

So we are reduced to seeing that @xmath is nonempty. Since two vacuums
can never border each other, this is reduced to seeing that every vacuum
has a @xmath internal edge. Well suppose not then our vacuum would be an
embedded snake with all boundary edges having a zero along them and all
internal angles being zero and zero curvature. This forces our vacuum to
have only triangles @xmath with @xmath , so could only be a pair of
heads. When two heads face each other at edge @xmath we have @xmath
contradicting that fact we are in @xmath . So @xmath must be non-empty
and we are done.

## Chapter \thechapter From the Discrete to the Continuous

This chapter is dedicated to setting up the geometry and probability
needed to compute the random variables discussed in section 1.2.2 of the
introduction. In particular we fill in the details to all the steps in
the probabilistic proof of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem sketch in section
1.1. In section 3.1 we develop all the geometric tools necessary to
prove theorem 1 from the introduction. This includes section 3.3 where
we examine some properties of Delaunay triangulations on surface
independent of the rest of the thesis but of interest to anyone wanting
get a feel for these triangulations.

In section 3.2 we explore random Delaunay triangulation. In 3.2.1 we
develop all the ideas need to prove the theorem 2 and
Euler-Delaunay-Poisson formula. In sections 8.2 and 8.3 we develop a
formula for computing random variables on the space of random Delaunay
triangulations (or complexes), and in particular prove the
Euler-Gauss-Bonnet-Delaunay formula form the introduction. Section 3.2.4
contains some particularly boring facts concerning the measurability of
certain function and sets which arise in the first two sections of this
chapter.

### 7 Delaunay Triangulations

This section is dedicated to the exploration of Delaunay triangulations.
The technical backbone for all that occurs in this proof is theorem 1
from the introduction, which is dealt with in section 3.1.2. The
geometry continues in section 3.1.3 where theorem 1 is proved (with the
help of certain ”inflating families” also dealt with in section 3.1.2).

Then in section 7.5 we prove some interesting properties about Delaunay
triangulations. These facts will not needed in the rest of thesis but
are of interest in showing how certain facts about Euclidean Delaunay
triangulations carry over to surfaces. The facts explored include that
Delaunay triangulations are local, several local facts, justification of
algorithm constructions, as well as results showing that the Delaunay
triangulation of a dense @xmath is in several ways optimal amongst dense
triangulations; where a triangulation @xmath is called dense is if each
@xmath has its vertices on a ball of radius less than @xmath . For the
Euclidean versions of essentially all these facts with quite different
proofs see [ 8 ] . Throughout this section I’ll assume @xmath is simply
@xmath . To entice the reader perhaps I’ll mention now what these
optimality properties are. For our first optimality property we have.

###### Property 1

Among dense triangulations associated to a dense @xmath the energy

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is minimized precisely at the Delaunay triangulation.

In section 4 we will see that the “gradient flow” of this energy tells
us how to deform a dense triangulation associated to a dense @xmath into
its Delaunay triangulation.

Notice the smaller this energy the squatter the triangles. That Delaunay
triangles minimize this energy is one reflection of the fact that they
prefer fat triangles. There are many realizations of this fact, another
is the fact that the Delaunay triangulation attempts to minimize the
sizes of associated spheres. To articulate this we first must
acknowledge that by lemma 1 of the next section the vertices of a
triangle @xmath in a dense triangulation lie on a uniquely associated
ball which will be denoted @xmath .

###### Property 2

Among all dense triangulations @xmath associated to a dense @xmath the
Delaunay triangulation minimizes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In section 7.5 we will also see the sense in which this is locally true.

#### 7.1 Some Geometric Reminders and Notation

To understand this paper one must be aware of geodesics, the exponential
map @xmath , and this map’s implicit interaction with balls and spheres.
Let the ball of radius @xmath at @xmath be @xmath - where @xmath is the
open ball of radius @xmath in @xmath , and denote it @xmath . Let the
sphere @xmath be its boundary. The first half of the needed results can
be summed up in the following lemma.

###### Lemma 12 (Geometric Reminders)

Assume @xmath is a compact Riemannian surface then:

1.   (Normal and Convex Neighborhoods) @xmath and @xmath are greater
    than zero.

2.   For any @xmath we have that @xmath is diffeomorphism of @xmath onto
    @xmath ; and if @xmath and @xmath satisfy @xmath , then there is a
    unique geodesic of length less than @xmath between them.

3.   (Gauss’s Lemma) The unique unit speed geodesics from @xmath to
    points in @xmath are given by @xmath for some @xmath ; and any such
    geodesic is orthogonal to @xmath .

It is worth explicitly reminding the reader that given an orthonormal
basis @xmath at @xmath we have the lovely normal coordinates:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Sometimes it is useful to think in terms of angular and radial
coordinates. Let @xmath , then as alternate coordinates we have the
geodesic polar coordinates:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In order to vary @xmath in the above it is necessary to have smoothly
varying orthonormal frames and they will be denoted @xmath . We can
always construct one on, say, a convex set; and can even globally have
one on @xmath . This is accomplished by Graham-Schmidting a pair of
generic vector fields, where @xmath is the finite set of points where
the vector fields are not linearly independent. In the the presence of a
frame we have a canonical choice for a a @xmath rotation field @xmath ;
by using the fact @xmath parameterizes the tangent spaces we can let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The last frame idea used is that of a geodesic frame at @xmath . Fixing
an orthonormal basis @xmath at @xmath , let the geodesic frame be the
the frame given by the parallel transport of this orthonormal basis of
@xmath along the geodesics spitting out from @xmath .

The other bit of geometry used are some basic Jacobi field results.
Recall that a Jacobi field is a vector field along a geodesic @xmath
satisfying

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with the initial condition @xmath and @xmath . (The choice of @xmath
here, as opposed to the usual @xmath , stems from the fact that our
Jacobi fields will be thought of as living along geodesics parameterized
by @xmath in some geodesic polar coordinates.)

Jacobi fields have the wonderful property of being in 1-1 correspondence
with smooth one parameter families of geodesics (in the standard
notation @xmath where @xmath is a geodesic for each @xmath ) and @xmath
. On a surface they come in four flavors. To taste these flavors first
one notes Jacobi fields with initial conditions perpendicular or
parallel to @xmath remain as such for all time. Also the equation is a
second order O.D.E., hence linear in its initial conditions - so a
Jacobi field can be decomposed into its component along @xmath and its
perpendicular component simply by decomposing its initial conditions as
such.

So we have all Jacobi field are linear combinations of the following
types (and some examples of corresponding @xmath ):

-   @xmath and @xmath (The two parameter family corresponding to this
    case is the friendly @xmath .)

-   @xmath and @xmath

-   @xmath and @xmath

-   @xmath and @xmath (The two parameter family corresponding to this
    case is the friendly @xmath . In particular this Jacobi field is
    precisely @xmath .

Sometimes one starts with a @xmath and wants to understand the
associated field - a well known example, that will prove relevant to us,
can be constructed by fixing a geodesic @xmath and a frame giving the
vector field @xmath along @xmath . The Jacobi field along @xmath
corresponding to @xmath is the the one with initial conditions @xmath ,
@xmath .

Here are some facts we will be needing about Jacobi fields, and in
particular what they look like in normal coordinates.

###### Lemma 13

1.   The Jacobi field along @xmath with initial conditions @xmath and
    @xmath in normal coordinates is @xmath .

2.   The Jacobi field along @xmath corresponding to @xmath and @xmath in
    normal coordinates is @xmath . Calling @xmath , we have @xmath ’s
    Taylor expansion is @xmath .

3.   The Jacobi field along @xmath with initial conditions @xmath and
    @xmath in normal coordinates can be written @xmath .

4.   Here are a few immediate consequences of part two - the area of a
    ball at @xmath function, @xmath , satisfies @xmath ; and the product
    @xmath .

It is necessary to have certain global estimates of the above @xmath
functions, resulting from the fact we are on a compact surface.

###### Lemma 14

If @xmath is compact, then there is a @xmath such that when @xmath we
have the @xmath functions in 3 and 4 above all satisfying @xmath
globally.

Proof of lemma 14 : First I’ll find the constant related to 4(c) above.
The Jacobi fields are the solutions to an o.d.e. - so vary continuously
with initial data - which is indexed by @xmath (the unit tangent
bundle). In particular @xmath varies continuously with initial data. Now
recalling from above the Taylor expansion in the radial variable at
@xmath we have @xmath ; and form Taylor’s formula the third term in this
sum can in fact be represented as (assuming the metric is smooth)

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In particular this term is continuous even after dividing by @xmath .
Now @xmath is compact so we can feel free to take @xmath ’s maximum over
this set for our @xmath .

Now observe that the other @xmath are directly related to this one and
the curvature function, and since the manifold is compact @xmath exists.
Choose the @xmath in the lemma to be the biggest of the constructed
constants among these @xmath functions.

q.e.d

Now we will prove some potentially less familiar geometric facts. The
first of which will be lemma 1 from the introduction. My original proof
of this fact was quite inelegant and can be found the the appendix. I’d
like to thank Albert Nijenhuis for sharing his beautiful proof with me.

The next facts we will need concerns the notion of an inflating family
of circles through a pair of points @xmath . As a set, this family will
be all circles of radius @xmath , passing through both the points @xmath
and @xmath . The following lemmas justify the fact that this set can be
thought of as the continuous inflating family of circular balloons to
the left or right ”sides” of the geodesic through @xmath and @xmath , as
in figure .

Too articulate this given a continuous curve @xmath let @xmath be the
continuous family of closed disks centered at @xmath of radius @xmath ,
and let @xmath be the corresponding family of circles. For starters we
have a lemma gaurenteeing the existence of inflating families.

###### Lemma 15

For each pair of points @xmath and @xmath such that @xmath there is a
curve @xmath such that every circles of radius less @xmath going through
@xmath and @xmath is @xmath for some @xmath .

Notice that the radius increases monotonically as @xmath does. We need a
lemma giving us another sense of monotonicity. To articulate it we first
develop a little notation. If @xmath let @xmath be the unique shortest
length geodesic connecting @xmath and @xmath , let @xmath be its
midpoint, let @xmath be the ball of radius @xmath at @xmath , and let
@xmath be its boundary. To articulate the next lemma note that the
geodesic connecting @xmath and @xmath removed form @xmath decomposes
@xmath into two open sets, which will be referred as the decomposition
determined by @xmath . Furthermore since @xmath any ball of radius less
than @xmath with @xmath and @xmath on its boundary is also divided into
two such pieces.

###### Lemma 16

@xmath is in one half of the decomposition determine by @xmath (call it
@xmath ) and @xmath in the other ( @xmath ). If @xmath then @xmath and
@xmath with all the subsets proper.

The essence of this lemma is that figure 20 is accurate.

#### 7.2 Small Circle Intersection

My original proof of lemma 1 was a bit long winded and I would like to
thank Albert Nijenhuis for showing me the elegant proof presented here.
Actually the proof presented here is a much less elegant modification of
the one Nijenhuis showed me where the needed injectivity radius is
chased through the argument. Any errors or any realization that the
injectivity bound is not as sharp as possible is solely my fault. Note
that the lemma will follow if one could show that two circles of radius
less than @xmath intersected in at most two points, which is proposition
2 below. Another proof of this can be found in [ 12 ] where the sharper
bound of @xmath is also demonstrated.

If @xmath and @xmath have distance between them less than the
injectivity radius, @xmath , denote as @xmath the unique minimal length
geodesic connecting them. Let @xmath and @xmath be the centers of two
intersecting circles of radius less than @xmath . Let @xmath be the
circle centered at @xmath , and @xmath be the open geodesic segment
containing @xmath with midpoint @xmath of length @xmath .

###### Lemma 17

@xmath intersects @xmath in exactly two points.

Proof: Note @xmath and any point on @xmath has a distance less than
@xmath form @xmath , so the diameter of @xmath intersecting @xmath is in
fact included in it. So @xmath intersects @xmath at least twice. However
a geodesic ray form @xmath of length less than @xmath can hit each
circle of radius @xmath centered at @xmath only once, so @xmath can only
hit @xmath twice. q.e.d

Consider @xmath , @xmath , so @xmath measures the distance between
@xmath and the points of @xmath .

###### Lemma 18

If @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath , then @xmath has (at least) one
critical point on each of the two circular arcs zw.

Proof: This follows from a standard min-max argument. q.e.d

###### Lemma 19

If @xmath is a critical point of @xmath , then @xmath .

proof: Since @xmath is a critical point and has a distance at most
@xmath from @xmath , the tangent to the segment @xmath at @xmath is
perpendicular to @xmath . So by Gauss’s lemma the distance to @xmath
along this geodesic or its potential @xmath or less length extension is
less than @xmath form @xmath , and we have @xmath . q.e.d

###### Proposition 2

Any two distinct circles of radius less than @xmath have at most 2
points in common.

proof: Suppose not. By lemma 18 there would be at least 3 distinct
critical points, which would all lie on @xmath by lemma 19 . But lemma
17 assures there are only two such critical points, the need
contradiction. q.e.d

#### 7.3 Inflating Families

I will construct the family by first describing the point set along
which the centers of the circles in the family live with a different
parameterization than that of lemma 15 . Note a point set this curve
consists of points satisfying @xmath - with @xmath with less than @xmath
. We will always denote as @xmath the most sensible connected extension
of @xmath . For the following lemma let it be the connected extension of
@xmath in @xmath . With this notation we have:

###### Lemma 20

If @xmath the point set described by @xmath in @xmath can be described
by a curve @xmath with @xmath satisfying

1.  @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath is the unique point of @xmath on @xmath

2.  @xmath and @xmath strictly increase as the parameter @xmath
    increases.

Proof: To see that the point set is a nicely parameterized curve it is
useful to note that it can be described as the integral curve of a
vector field. Let @xmath denote @xmath and let @xmath denote its
gradient. Note the solution to the equation @xmath are integral curves
of the vector field @xmath where @xmath is a @xmath rotation field.

To understand these integral curves we will first deal with the the
uniqueness of @xmath : suppose a point @xmath is on @xmath . Then @xmath
is within @xmath of @xmath ; hence @xmath is determined by the length of
the segment of @xmath from @xmath to @xmath , similarly for @xmath
(using @xmath ). Now note that as we move from @xmath toward, say,
@xmath that @xmath decreases while @xmath increase - so @xmath at
another point of @xmath . When @xmath is on @xmath , say above @xmath ,
the segment of @xmath from @xmath to @xmath in fact covers the shorter
segment from @xmath to @xmath - forcing @xmath once again. So @xmath
cannot satisfy @xmath , forcing @xmath to indeed be the unique point of
@xmath on @xmath .

Now we we will see that we indeed get a union of curves by noting that
that the vector field has no zeros in this set. In fact the triangle
inequality tells @xmath and in this region we will prove the stronger
fact that @xmath for any @xmath . First note that @xmath is unit length,
with integral curves the geodesics emanating from @xmath . So at @xmath
we have @xmath is length @xmath . To finish the assertion assume at some
point @xmath not on @xmath that we have @xmath . First note from the
that fact that @xmath is unit length we have @xmath . There are two
cases, first we’ll deal with @xmath . Since the geodesics satisfy a
second order O.D.E they are uniquely determined by their position and
tangent vector, so when @xmath we have both the geodesic from @xmath and
the geodesic form @xmath are the same curves. Without loss of generality
@xmath is further away than @xmath and this point lies along the same
minimal length geodesic (of length less than @xmath ) which connects
@xmath and @xmath , i.e. @xmath . In the case @xmath we can follow the
geodesic form @xmath to the point and then from the point back to @xmath
forming a geodesic of length less than @xmath - which then must by the
definition of the injectivity radius be the unique such one, i.e. @xmath
.

To finish off the first part we need that our curve has only one
component. This is intimately related to the second part. To see why we
first look at the component of @xmath in @xmath and note any component
of @xmath would have to have a point closest to @xmath . This closest
point is tangent to a sphere emanating form @xmath . The same sort of
phenomena must take place for the distance function to have a critical
point; namely if a point @xmath along any integral curve of @xmath is a
critical point of the distance function @xmath then either @xmath or a
circle is tangent to the solution curve. In the tangent case @xmath , or
rather @xmath ; so both these situation have forced the case @xmath . so
we may use the above observation to note that the point where this
occurs is on @xmath ; but from above to be on @xmath and @xmath means
you must be exactly @xmath . So we have both that every component of
@xmath in @xmath contains @xmath , and that the distance to @xmath
parameterized by @xmath can have no critical points except at @xmath
(similarly for @xmath ).

q.e.d

We can now prove lemma 15 by noting by part (b) of the above lemma we
may reparameterize as claimed and that any circle of radius less than
@xmath has its center contained in @xmath so this new parameterization
can be chosen on (and beyond) @xmath .

Now we shall prove lemma 16 .

Proof of lemma 16 : Notice the first part follows from part (a) of the
above lemma. To prove the rest of it it is useful to isolate a
sub-lemma.

###### Sub-lemma 1

The containments between the halves must switch. Precisely if @xmath
then @xmath and visa versa.

Proof: Suppose that @xmath . Note that either @xmath or @xmath since a
violation of this inclusion would result in a third intersection of two
circles of radius less than @xmath - contradicting lemma . From this
observation, to violate the above choices would mean that @xmath . Such
an inclusion would force the circles to be tangent at there intersection
points - and hence the centers of both disks to be on @xmath (since the
curve orthogonal to the tangent is a geodesic heading to the circle’s
center by Gauss’s lemma). But then @xmath forcing both the centers and
the radii to be the same. So the disks would be identical contradicting
distinctness.

q.e.d

We may finish the proof of the monotonicity of inflation half of lemma
16 . By the above sub-lemma we are left to explore three cases.

The first case is where @xmath or @xmath is zero. If @xmath then the
geodesic from @xmath to @xmath to the boundary of @xmath is strictly
larger than @xmath (by part (b) of lemma 20 ). So a switch of
containment is impossible in this case. For the @xmath case note by the
above sub-lemma one is contained in the other, and as just noted @xmath
. So it must be the case @xmath as needed.

If @xmath then from the above we know @xmath . From this the fact @xmath
would by the continuity of @xmath and the uniqueness of the circles in
the pencil (lemma ) force there to be a @xmath (or @xmath ) such that
@xmath contains a pont in @xmath . This produces extra intersections of
distinct circles contradicting lemma .

To handle @xmath recall form the first case that we have both @xmath and
@xmath . So by the sub-lemma we must have @xmath and @xmath . Now we can
contradict @xmath using same argument as in the second case, with the
one variation being that this time we construct an @xmath such that
@xmath where @xmath contains other points.

q.e.d

#### 7.4 The Existence of Delaunay Triangulations

Here we prove theorem 1 from the introduction. To do so first we needed
to actually construct @xmath . Part of @xmath ’s construction is
canonical; namely the mapping of the 1-skeleton. This because @xmath is
in an affine space and we can let the edges of @xmath map onto there
corresponding unique geodesic segments by factoring with an affine map
through the geodesic’s unit speed parameterization. Now we need to
extend this continuous mapping of the 1-skeleton to a continuous map of
@xmath .

Let @xmath lie on a disk @xmath of radius less than @xmath and note the
existence of @xmath requires only an identification of the correct
triangle @xmath . Throughout this proof a bold face letter will always
denote a triple forming a face.

Since @xmath ’s radius is less than @xmath for each pair of distinct
points @xmath and @xmath on @xmath we have that @xmath is split into its
two halves. If @xmath lies in one half let @xmath denote the closure of
that half, the region enclosed by the bold dashed line in figure 21 .
Notice since the radius is less than @xmath that by the uniqueness of
small geodesic this set is convex.

###### Lemma 21

If @xmath lies on a disk @xmath of radius less than @xmath , then the
triangle @xmath is a convex topological disk bounded by @xmath @xmath
and @xmath . Further more for any @xmath and @xmath on @xmath if @xmath
then @xmath .

Proof: Since @xmath is the intersection of convex sets it is convex.
Each @xmath contains @xmath so by convexity each contains all the @xmath
. Now the only possible boundary of this set is the @xmath or the
boundary of @xmath , but other than @xmath all the points on @xmath ’s
boundary have been eliminated. So @xmath is a convex set with boundary
@xmath contained in the convex disk @xmath , hence itself a topological
disk as needed.

Now for the second assertion. @xmath is an embedded disk so if the
assertion fails then one of the @xmath crosses @xmath . By continuity it
will hit @xmath in at least a pair of points, as in figure 21 . So this
pair of points is connected by two distinct geodesics of length less
than @xmath . Hence we have a contradiction regarding the the uniqueness
of geodesics of length less than the injectivity radius.

q.e.d

Now that we have the mapping @xmath let us prove @xmath onto. Since
@xmath is closed (a union of closed sets) if it is not onto it must miss
an open set, and the boundary of this open set must be composed of the
edges of triangles in @xmath (see bold region in figure ). So we would
be done if the notion of edge and the notion of an edge belonging to a
pair of faces becomes interchangeable in the presence of @xmath
-density.

To see this suppose we have an edge connecting a pair @xmath and @xmath
, then by its very definition there is a @xmath with the property @xmath
is empty of points. We may right off the bat use our assumption of
@xmath -density to see that this empty disk must correspond to a radius
@xmath . Now start inflating to the left of @xmath . When @xmath the
radius is @xmath so @xmath contains a point. By the monotonicity lemma
(lemma 16 ) once you hit a point moving leftward you cover for it all
future time, so there is a unique @xmath such that @xmath first contains
a third point to the left of @xmath . You may view this process as the
blowing up of a circular balloon as dynamically represented in figure 22
, and note we proved that it must pop. Similarly there is a @xmath to
the right were the balloon pops. Since we are assuming that there are
never four points on a circle we have @xmath . So @xmath and @xmath
correspond to the unique left and right faces as needed.

Now let us deal with @xmath being 1-1. Since the individual faces are
embedded this would follow immediately from the following lemma.

###### Lemma 22

Two distinct faces @xmath and @xmath can intersect only in a vertex or
an edge.

Proof: Suppose @xmath and @xmath intersect and have associated now
intersecting circles @xmath and @xmath respectively. If @xmath and
@xmath intersect in one point then @xmath and @xmath being the only
points of @xmath and @xmath on @xmath and @xmath respectively forces
@xmath to be a vertex. So we may assume by lemma 1 that @xmath and
@xmath intersect in precisely two distinct @xmath and @xmath .
Furthermore as in lemma 16 @xmath and @xmath are both split by @xmath
and since no disk contains four points the interiors of @xmath and
@xmath are on opposite sides of @xmath . So by the second part of lemma
21 @xmath and @xmath can only intersect along @xmath . Since the
boundary of the say @xmath is @xmath for this to occur either @xmath is
precisely @xmath or @xmath , some @xmath is tangent to @xmath , or some
@xmath contains two points of @xmath . By the uniqueness of small
geodesics in the last case @xmath . In the tangent case the fact that
geodesic are the solutions to a second order O.D.E. once again gives us
@xmath . So in any case distinct faces can only intersect by sharing a
vertex or an edge as needed.

q.e.d

So we have @xmath is a bijective continuous map from a compact space
hence a homeomorphism, and theorem 1 has been proved.

q.e.d (theorem 1 )

#### 7.5 Basic Properties of Delaunay Triangulations

The first property worth exploring is the fact that a Delaunay
triangulation is a local phenomena.

###### Definition 17

Call a dense triangulation Delaunay at an edge @xmath if the vertex
forming the face to left side of @xmath is out side the circle
associated the right side’s face.

Notice by the monotonicity lemma (lemma 16 ) that the property of being
Delaunay at @xmath is equivalent to the same property with the sides
reversed.

###### Lemma 23

A triangulation is Delaunay at each edge if and only if it is Delaunay.

Proof: Clearly Delaunay implies locally Delaunay. To see the converse
suppose it were not true and there is a triangle @xmath with an extra
point @xmath in its associated disk. Then @xmath is in a region of the
disk to one side of an edge of @xmath . However since each edge is
Delaunay this vertex cannot be the third vertex of the face on this side
or be in its associated face. Further more by the monotonicity lemma it
is also in this new triangle’s associated disk. So the same situation
persists for this new face. Using this observation one can now construct
a sequence of such triangles and edges with each new edge clearly closer
to the point. So we produce an infinite sequence of distinct edges
containing points in a neighborhood of @xmath contradicting even local
finiteness of the triangulation (let alone the fact it is globally
finite.)

q.e.d

There is another very basic local property of the dense triangulations.
I will call it the switching property.

###### Lemma 24

If two triangles @xmath and @xmath of a dense triangulation are not
Delaunay at @xmath then @xmath is convex. The triangulation formed by
switching the diagonal inside @xmath is Delaunay at @xmath and @xmath .

Proof: First we prove the convexity assertion. Note the triangles both
are inscribed in @xmath which is convex and have interiors on opposite
sides of @xmath . The key fact is that a shortest length geodesic
connecting two points in @xmath and @xmath must cross @xmath . From this
observation @xmath is convex, since if it were not then then we could
construct a shortest length geodesic form an interior point of a
triangle to @xmath which must cross through another triangle side,
contradicting the fact that the triangle is convex.

From the monotonicity lemma (lemma 16 ) the ball @xmath with diagonal
@xmath is contained in @xmath and contains @xmath , see figure 23 .
Furthermore lemma 16 gives us that the closures of @xmath and @xmath
intersect only at @xmath and @xmath . In particular the ball with
diagonal @xmath is strictly contained in @xmath with @xmath and @xmath
now out side and on different sides of @xmath . So we immediately see
the the length of @xmath is less than the length of @xmath , and we may
use the inflating family associated to @xmath and @xmath to hunt down
@xmath and @xmath demonstrating that the triangulation is indeed
Delaunay at @xmath .

q.e.d

It worth noting that the converse holds among convex Delaunay
parallelograms, although the convexity assumption is now necessary.

The first corollary of the locality and switching lemmas is the proof of
property 1 .

Proof of Property 1 : Note the set of possible triangulations is finite
(it is certainly less than or equal to the cardinality of the vertices
choose 3), so there is at least one minimizer of @xmath . If the
minimizer is not @xmath then by lemma 23 there is an edge which is not
Delaunay, so by lemma 24 we may rearrange the triangulation at the
parallelogram living at this edge. Note the only edge which is changed
is the diagonal and its length is strictly decreased hence the energy is
decreased contradicting @xmath ’s minimality. So the minimizer must be
@xmath .

q.e.d

To see property 2 it is useful to first prove the following local lemma.

###### Lemma 25

Let @xmath be @xmath a triangle in the Delaunay triangulation and let
@xmath be the center of @xmath ’s associated circle. If @xmath is a
dense triangulation relative to the same points and @xmath is a triangle
in @xmath such that both @xmath , then @xmath .

Proof: Assume @xmath , since the result is trivial otherwise. First note
all of the points including the vertices of @xmath are in @xmath . By
the triangle inequality if @xmath is a proper subset of @xmath we are
done. So we may assume the bounding circles, @xmath and @xmath ,
intersect in two points (lemma 1 ) with lemma 1 assuring us the vertices
of @xmath all on one side of the decomposition determined by these
circles (or this side’s closure). From lemma 21 @xmath and hence @xmath
will also lies on this same side side of the decomposition (or its
closure). Now look at the inflating family determined by the
intersection points of the bounding circles. By the monotonicity lemma
(lemma 16 ) in order to contain greater or equal area on the side of the
pencil where the vertices of @xmath and @xmath live @xmath must be
greater than @xmath as needed.

q.e.d

Proof of Property 2 : First take a triangle @xmath with @xmath having
maximal radius in @xmath . For any dense triangulation @xmath there is a
triangle @xmath of @xmath containing the center of @xmath . Now lemma 25
guarantees that the radius of @xmath is at least that of @xmath proving
the corollary. q.e.d

Its also worth noting that the geometrically minimal spanning trees
(GMST) make sense on a surface as well as relative neighborhood graphs
(RN) and Gabriel graphs (GG) and for the same exact reasons as in
Euclidean space we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

So to construct all these things it would be nice to see that we can
construct @xmath computationally, and that in fact the basic algorithm
for changing a triangulation @xmath into @xmath works just fine.

The algorithm is essentially gradient flow of the energy @xmath ; namely
switch edges which are not Delaunay as in lemma 23 . This procedure
terminates in certainly fewer than the number possible triangulation
steps since each triangulation has an associated energy and by lemma 23
the energy is always decreasing under this “flow”. By lemma 23 this flow
must terminate in the Delaunay triangulation.

In fact this procedure must end before the number of vertices choose two
steps. This follows immediately from the following lemma telling us that
an edge once switched can never be formed again.

###### Lemma 26

If one dense triangulation contains @xmath and fails to be Delaunay at
@xmath then there is no dense triangulation containing @xmath which is
Delaunay at @xmath .

Proof: This follows from the monotonicity lemma (lemma 16 ) which
guarantees that no disks in @xmath ’s inflating family can ever be
empty. q.e.d

### 8 Random Delaunay Triangulations

As described in the chapters introduction here we tackle a the details
needed about random Delaunay triangulations and the needed random
variable computations.

#### 8.1 Basic Facts About Random Delaunay Triangulations

Poisson Point Process Reminders: In order to set up some notation and
convince the unfamiliar that nothing deep is occurring, we will now
construct from scratch what little we need of the Poisson point process,
i.e. the probability space from the introduction.

To get started it is useful to look at the space of sets of ordered sets
of @xmath points, with a small set conveniently removed. This small set
is the union of three closed measure zero sets: the set where some
@xmath for @xmath , the set where four points land on a circle of radius
@xmath , and the set were three points land on a circle of radius
exactly @xmath . (These removals are merely a technical convenience - so
I will not index @xmath with a @xmath - though a bit of @xmath has been
programmed into it.) When I say measure zero I mean using the Riemannian
product measure @xmath ; that these sets are closed and measure zero is
straight forward though bit boring; detailed proofs can be found in
section 8.4 . Let @xmath denote this full measure open subset of @xmath
, and let @xmath be the Riemannian volume element restricted to this
open set. The sets of points of interest to us can now be expressed as
points in @xmath .

The measure, @xmath , on this space is given by weighting @xmath on each
component by @xmath . This is a probability measure since the measure of
@xmath under @xmath is @xmath , and so the size of @xmath is @xmath .
Lastly, the measurable sets @xmath will be the Borel @xmath -algebra.

On the @xmath index we have what is usually referred to as the Poisson
distribution, namely @xmath ; which justifies (in this model) the
computation of @xmath from the introduction. As further warm up from
this view point it is useful to explore the probability that some chunk
@xmath of area @xmath in @xmath is empty of points. Strictly speaking of
course @xmath is not a set of points in @xmath . Being careful about is
perhaps less burden then any confusion resulting form it, so I will
introduce the mapping @xmath defined as @xmath . So we are trying to
find the size of the set where @xmath ,or rather @xmath . For each for
each @xmath using the Riemannian volume element this set has precisely
the measure of @xmath , which has size @xmath ; and now we can sum them
up to find the needed measure is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

So we arrive at the last property of this model need for this proof.

Now we would like to beginning proving theorem from the introduction. We
start with:

###### Proposition 3

@xmath , with @xmath and @xmath greater than zero.

Proof: The heart of the proof is that points when distributed as above
land very densely which is what being in @xmath means; and we know by
theorem that @xmath . Note by the triangle inequality any ball of radius
@xmath covering the center of a ball of radius @xmath must be contained
in it. So to force every ball of radius @xmath to contain a point it is
sufficient to cover the surface with balls of radius @xmath , and then
force this finite set of balls to contain points. So cover the surface
with the @xmath balls and pick out a finite sub-cover with say @xmath
elements. Let @xmath be the minimum area amongst these @xmath balls. Now
let @xmath be the set where none of these @xmath balls is empty. By the
above observation @xmath , so we have @xmath . Now @xmath is precisely
the union of the sets were some individual of the @xmath balls is empty
- so clearly measurable. By the sub-additivity of measures, the warm up
computation, and the choices of @xmath and @xmath we now have @xmath has
size less than @xmath . So assuming @xmath is measurable (in fact it is
open, to be seen in the final section), we have @xmath , as needed.

q.e.d

From this we can get the needed estimates regarding the @xmath , @xmath
, and @xmath finishing of theorem 2 from the introduction (up the
measurability which is in fact trivial since the functions are
continuous on @xmath - a fact whose details can be found in section 8.4
).

Proof of Theorem 2 : First let’s do it for the faces. If there are
@xmath points then the number of faces is usually much less than @xmath
. So by the above proposition even the worse case for the area of @xmath
is better than when @xmath worth of area is crammed into the part of the
space where @xmath is the largest (or @xmath for the edges or @xmath for
the vertices). In other words letting @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

So really it is this quantity we estimate. The monotonicity of @xmath in
@xmath indicates that we can realize this @xmath with any set size
@xmath which fills up all the @xmath for @xmath along with some subset
of size @xmath in @xmath . To make sure we can perform this construction
it is useful to observes as a scholium to the above proposition that we
have @xmath . So we naturally may stay away from the @xmath point mass
at @xmath , and can indeed realize a set of the needed size. So for this
@xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

So we now have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The second term decays faster than any polynomial, so we are reduced to
seeing the terms in the form @xmath decay quickly, with @xmath and
@xmath non-negative integers.

To approach these terms first we use that our upper bound gives us
@xmath , or rather @xmath .

In particular

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Applying this to our term gives the quite manageable estimate

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now we see these terms would decay faster than any polynomial if the
@xmath grew (with @xmath ) no faster than a polynomial. To see this is
so, note that our estimate in the other direction gives us @xmath Now
@xmath so we might hope @xmath must remain quite small for this to be so
large. In fact this is easy to show; we may even observe a rather
extreme fact that @xmath cannot have a subsequence grow even as fast as
@xmath with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

To see this note that Stirling’s formula tells us that @xmath , so
assuming @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This goes to zero since the geometric series at @xmath converges.

The @xmath and @xmath cases are virtually identical - simply do the same
thing with @xmath and @xmath rather than @xmath . So once again up to
the measurability we are done.

q.e.d

Let @xmath be the set of ordered triples in @xmath which are on circles
of radius less than @xmath , and let @xmath be a measurable function on
@xmath with its restriction to @xmath in @xmath and which is symmetric
under any permutation of the coordinates. Let @xmath be a random
variable on @xmath which is given as a @xmath where by @xmath we mean
the ordered triple in @xmath corresponding to the face @xmath . (that
this function and the functions introduced below are measurable can be
easily seen; see section 8.4 if there is any confusion). For such a
random variable we have its expect value given by:

###### Theorem 11

With the above notation we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proof: Given a set @xmath let @xmath be the projection mapping of @xmath
onto @xmath . Now note that every triple will be uniquely represented as
@xmath by one of these @xmath . Define a function @xmath to be one if
@xmath and the triple @xmath is on a disk of radius less than @xmath and
has its uniquely associated open disk is empty of points in the
configuration @xmath ; and zero otherwise. Let @xmath on @xmath , and
note the above random variable @xmath is precisely the function defined
on @xmath which is @xmath on each @xmath .

This formula buys us a better look at @xmath . First noting that @xmath
and @xmath differ by a measure zero set and breaking up the integral
into the pieces over the disjoint pieces of the space we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Using our formula for @xmath and the linearity of the integral we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now by symmetry each @xmath (for a fixed @xmath ) has the same integral
so we may write @xmath as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

To do this integral note @xmath is a function which is zero off the set
with two properties. First of all, the triple @xmath is on a ball of
radius less than @xmath - call it @xmath ; and, secondly, all of the
other points in @xmath are in @xmath . So this set can be given by
@xmath with @xmath denoting the coordinates onto which @xmath projects.
Note that on this set our random variable is @xmath (at least off a
measure zero subset where it is zero) and so is constant on each of the
disjoint @xmath pieces of the above set. So Fubini’s theorem (with the
@xmath assumption) tells us

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the area of the ball function for @xmath with @xmath
containing three distinct points and zero other wise.

Plugging this into the above computation, and using Fubini’s theorem
once again, we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Q.E.D.

Note in particular when @xmath we have equation ( 1 ) from the
introduction.

#### 8.2 The Geometric Coordinates

Now its time to carefully set up the coordinates form the introduction,
and to derive equation ( 2 ) from the introduction. Here we will
parameterize a full measure subset @xmath via the set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This mapping will be based on the exponential mapping @xmath (see [ 6 ]
), and its definition requires a orthonormal frame @xmath - which can be
defined at all but a finite number of points ( @xmath ) of @xmath .
Identifying @xmath with the triple of variables @xmath , denoted as
@xmath , we can explicitly define our mapping @xmath as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the points excluded from @xmath are precisely @xmath .

Clearly we land inside the triples on circles of radius less than @xmath
and so are well defined. The differentiability of the exponential map
guarantees @xmath is a differentiable on @xmath . We would of course
like to say more than that we have a differentiable map. As we know by
lemma a triple uniquely determines its disk when the radius is less than
@xmath , so the @xmath and @xmath coordinates are uniquely determined.
Also @xmath corresponding to the 6 permutation of a distinct triple is
hit precisely by the 6 distinct images under @xmath of @xmath with
@xmath and @xmath fixed. So @xmath is injective. Also @xmath ’s image is
almost everything since any triple in @xmath not centered at @xmath is
hit; a set which his of course measure zero (see section 8.4 ).

Being bijective (to a full measure set) and differentiable, @xmath forms
a re-parameterization of a full measure subset of @xmath ; and with it
we may continue the computation from the previous section this section
finding

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The remainder of this sub-section will be dedicated to finding an
explicit formula for @xmath . Since we are pulling back a Riemannian
volume form, understanding how the metric pulls back will determine how
the the volume pulls back; and this will be our strategy. Pulling back
the metric in an arbitrary frame is fortunately not needed; in fact the
expression for the volume form at @xmath when pulled back by @xmath
depends only on the orthonormal basis choice at @xmath . Letting @xmath
be the the volume form on @xmath (since @xmath is an open set in @xmath
) we can express this as:

###### Lemma 27

Suppose the frames @xmath and @xmath agree at @xmath , then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proof: First notice that given two smooth orthonormal frames @xmath and
@xmath defined on a simply connected open set of @xmath (call it @xmath
), they can be orthogonal compared via a smoothly varying element of
@xmath . @xmath being simply connected allows us to lift this mapping
from @xmath to its cover @xmath . Otherwise said: there is a
differentiable function @xmath such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Let @xmath be the mapping

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Using this mapping note that our mapping satisfies @xmath on @xmath .

Now simply note that using @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Assuming the frames agree at @xmath , we have @xmath . So by the above
formula @xmath acts as the identity at this point - giving

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

as needed.

q.e.d

To actually compute the inner products it is useful to canonically
identify all the tangent spaces near @xmath as as @xmath and @xmath vary
with a frame determined by the triple product of the normal coordinates
at @xmath , @xmath , via

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

While not an orthonormal frame a certain amount of the Euclidean
geometry in @xmath is preserved by this frame. For starters each of the
@xmath copies in @xmath is orthogonal to the others, since @xmath is an
open subset of @xmath in its product metric, and this mapping is
respecting the product structure. Denote the vectors in this @xmath as
@xmath . Further more by Gauss’s lemma each of these @xmath components
decomposes orthogonally (when @xmath ) into @xmath and @xmath - with
respect to the both the Euclidean metric and the surface metric. So for
each triple of angles we may in fact represent the vectors with the
following orthogonal decomposition

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

To understand the lengths of these vectors in this decomposition it is
necessary to remind our selves about Jacobi Fields.

We can now get a grip on our needed vector lengths.

###### Lemma 28

Suppose @xmath is a geodesic frame at @xmath then using the above
notation we have:

-   -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    Similarly for @xmath and @xmath .

-   -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

-   -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    Similarly for @xmath .

@xmath The idea for all these computations is identical. For each
component one finds a curve @xmath such that @xmath and then one notes
that in fact @xmath for some two parameter family of geodesics - forcing
our vector, @xmath , to be Jacobi fields. At this point one uses the
Jacobi lemma (lemma in section 7.1 ) to observe the above formulas.

For example for @xmath is by our Jacobi field observations is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By the discussion preceding lemma this is the Jacobi field with initial
conditions @xmath and @xmath - located in the in the first component of
@xmath . So we have a description of it from part 3 of lemma as @xmath .

Now let’s play the same game for the radial direction and note that the
image of @xmath is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which by part 1 of lemma is @xmath .

Finally to compute the vector in the @xmath direction use the geodesic
pointing in that direction and vary along it. This is the situation of
the example preceding lemma , and we have @xmath described as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since the frame we are using is geodesic at @xmath we have @xmath so
@xmath (by the example preceding lemma - once again). By the discussion
preceding the Jacobi lemma , we may decompose this field by decomposing
@xmath into @xmath and @xmath in each component; so we have this Jacobi
field has one summand corresponding to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and @xmath . This field is dealt with by the first part of lemma , and
gives the first set of vectors. The other summand in the decomposition
corresponds to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with @xmath - which is dealt with in by the second part of lemma . These
formulas are precisely the last of the needed inner-product
relationships.

q.e.d

With the use of these lemmas we accomplish our goal of computing the
pullback of the volume form in @xmath coordinates and derive equation (
2 ).

###### Proposition 4

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with @xmath the area of a triangle with vertices at @xmath in the
Euclidean plane.

@xmath Let’s compute the form at a point @xmath . Using the normal
coordinates for the @xmath variables note we have @xmath . We need to
find @xmath . To do so first note by lemma that we may use the geodesic
frame at @xmath with the initial vectors @xmath . Recalling that @xmath
, and that from lemma in section 1.1 @xmath . Using the above
observation we now have can easily compute the determinant.

Letting

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we find

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Take its square root to find

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now @xmath is precisely @xmath at in these coordinates (at @xmath ) - so
we have our needed equality.

q.e.d

Actually it is useful to witness the matrix forming the determinant in
the above proposition and hence find that it is relatively easy to
compute. Note

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

so one can pull the @xmath out of the matrix and the symmetries of the
remaining matrix make the computation of the determinant relatively
transparent. (Trying to see this first hand proves useful when one
begins exploring the three dimensional computation.)

#### 8.3 The Euler-Gauss-Bonnet-Delaunay Formula

It is now time to compute the needed random variables. All the random
variables encountered have expected values expressible as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with the @xmath bounded and measurable functions on @xmath . In this
expression and throughout out this paper remainder a function denoted
@xmath will mean a function @xmath on @xmath satisfying @xmath for some
constant @xmath .

To compute the above expected value first note that one can Taylor
expand in @xmath the area of a ball of radius @xmath at @xmath as @xmath
(in fact this follows immediately form the o.d.e. describing the @xmath
Jacobi fields and the fact the surface is compact). This formula allows
us to choose constants @xmath and @xmath such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for all @xmath and at all @xmath .

###### Theorem 12

Using the above notation, letting @xmath , and using a decision radius
smaller than @xmath we have @xmath equals

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proof: As a preliminary observation, the above fact about @xmath and the
mean value theorem gives us

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Using this fact @xmath equals

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (8)
     @xmath      (9)
     @xmath      (10)
     @xmath      (11)
     @xmath      (12)
     @xmath      (13)
  -- -------- -- ------

The first thing to observe at this point is that for any @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and similarly with the @xmath integral. This is because

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Where @xmath - which by l’hoptial’s rule decays faster than any
polynomial.

Armed with this observation we may explicitly integrate the first two
terms in the above function with the only expense being a @xmath term.
After doing so we find the non @xmath terms in @xmath to equal equal

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath . Plugging in @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
we arrive at the above formula.

Likewise upon integration we see the remaining four terms are indeed
@xmath .

Q.E.D

We now can compute this for the random variable @xmath counting the
number of faces.

###### Corollary 2

With @xmath and calling @xmath , we have the expected number of faces in
the configuration can be expressed as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

@xmath From the theorem in the previous section the @xmath corresponding
to the @xmath random variable is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Using the o.d.e. describing the Jacobi field and the fact @xmath is
compact we now immediately have @xmath ’s Taylor expansion is @xmath ,
and as such @xmath . So we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

as needed. Q.E.D.

Let us now use the Euler-Delaunay-Poisson formula (formula 1 ) to figure
out the constant @xmath ( if you prefer, the integral it represents is
easy to compute). We know the Euler characteristic of the flat tours of
area one is zero; so as @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

forcing @xmath .

Plugging this into the formula in the corollary we have the needed
equation ( 4 ).

#### 8.4 Silly Continuity Results

We have several functions which we need continuous, and several sets we
need either open or closed and measure zero; here we deal with these
issues. Let us start by collecting and dealing with the needed closed
measure zero results.

###### Fact 4

The following sets are closed and measure zero where indicated:

1.  @xmath in @xmath .

2.  @xmath in @xmath .

3.   The set of points @xmath in @xmath where four points in @xmath lie
    upon a circle of radius @xmath .

4.   The set of points @xmath in @xmath where three points in @xmath lie
    upon a circle of radius exactly @xmath .

@xmath We will simply realize these sets as finite unions of the
differentiable images of lower dimension sets, hence measure zero. They
will all be clearly relatively closed in the specified sets.

Let @xmath be @xmath . The set we are removing is precisely the union of
the @xmath index permutations of the set @xmath , as needed.

For the next part I’ll prove something a bit stronger. Let @xmath be the
set of all triples on circles of radius less than or equal to @xmath
with repeats allowed. I will show the stronger result that @xmath acting
on @xmath hits all but a measure zero set of @xmath . To see this let
@xmath be a frame defined at each point of @xmath ; and then we have
missed exactly

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This is a finite union of the differentiable images of 4 dimensional
sets so measure zero and clearly relatively closed in the 6 dimensional
space.

For the third part first look at the image of the the 7 dimension space

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

under the mapping given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It is measure zero as a subset of @xmath . Union it with the same set
using the above @xmath . With this unioning it is clearly relatively
closed in @xmath . Now product this with the other @xmath components and
take the union over the @xmath permuted copies of this set in @xmath and
remove them; hence removing all the possible quadruples on the same
circles. This amounts to a finite removal of closed measure zero sets,
as needed.

Similarly for the last part, where we use instead the the image under
@xmath (and @xmath ) of @xmath in @xmath .

q.e.d

Now we need some functions to be continuous and some sets to be open.

###### Fact 5

@xmath is open in @xmath ; and @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are
continuous in @xmath .

@xmath All these cases could we handled simultaneously if one could
perturb a set of points and not change any of the assignments given to a
triple, a pair, or a singleton. We may restrict or attention to a set
coming form @xmath , since @xmath is a disjoint union of such sets.
Clearly the assignment is discontinuous on @xmath ; and what is being
claimed is that all the discontinuities occur on the removed measure
zero sets.

That any singleton is still a distinct vertex is true due to the removal
of the set corresponding to part one of the above fact. In fact this
removal guarantees all points in @xmath can simultaneously be separated
by open sets (including any pair or triple).

To deal with the stability of face assignment to a triple, @xmath ,
first observe the removal of the fourth set guarantees @xmath and @xmath
are open. So @xmath ’s relationship to @xmath is open, finishing off the
stability argument if the point fails to be on a circle of radius less
than @xmath . In the case where the triple does lie on such a circle,
note that @xmath for a suitable @xmath . So the disk associated to a
triple varies continuously with the triples position ( @xmath and @xmath
in the parameterization). Now suppose @xmath is not assigned a face due
to a point in its associated disk’s interior. This violating point must
have a neighborhood in the disks interior. So by the above continuity of
disk position, there is an open set @xmath about @xmath and an open set
@xmath about @xmath such that @xmath is contained in the disks
associated to @xmath for each @xmath . So the triple having no
associated face is indeed an open condition. Virtually this same
argument guarantees that in the case when the disk is empty that there
is an open set about @xmath such that no point in this open set is in
the disk associated to @xmath for @xmath in some @xmath . The only
difference is that we must note that we removed the possibility of four
points on a circle (part 3 above) - so indeed each point in @xmath is in
an open set separating it form the closed disk, as needed. So off the
above measure zero sets the notion of face is indeed stable in an open
set.

The edges require a small amount more thought. An edge @xmath existing
implies there is a @xmath such that @xmath is empty. We may attempt to
deform the inflating family to the left and to the right of @xmath . If
we cannot it is because a third point lies to the left or right side of
the circle. Now since we may assume there is not a fourth point on the
same circle, in one of these directions so we indeed can deform our
inflating family; and in fact in both directions if the circle’s radius
is @xmath - since no triple lives on such a circle. In particular,
choosing a different @xmath if necessary, we now have a circle of radius
less than @xmath which is empty, and is contained in an neighborhood
empty of other vertices. Now one can proceed exactly as above to note
that @xmath is constant on a neighborhood. The notion of no edge
requires a more delicate use of our inflating family ideas. The key
observation is that from the monotonicity lemma a point is in @xmath if
and only if it is in each @xmath for @xmath . From this the idea is to
find @xmath such that @xmath contains a point in its interior. Then each
of these sets will, as above, satisfy this property when the points are
perturbed - and the notion of no edge will be stable. (Note at @xmath
and @xmath we need not use the @xmath - since there is a point in the
interior of each of these disks which we may use.) To construct the
@xmath start at @xmath and take a point inside it. Move the inflating
family rightward until at some @xmath this point fails to be in the disk
(if such a point does not exist we may use @xmath and @xmath .) Now
since there is no empty disk @xmath contains some other point. Being in
its interior this is in fact true for the parameters in @xmath . Let
@xmath and @xmath . Now continue this process making @xmath smaller if
necessary. There are a finite number of distributed points - so
eventually one must hit @xmath or an empty disk. An empty disk is
impossible, since no edge was put in; and we are done.

q.e.d

## Chapter \thechapter The Continuous Uniformization Theorem

This section accomplishes two things. For starters in section 9 we use
theorem 12 of the previous chapter to actually calculate the energies on
the space of metrics of interest form section 1.2.2 and 1.2.3. This
involves first a careful look at how the angles in a geodesic net deform
under a conformal breeze followed by the actual computations. Section
4.2 contains an actual proof of the uniformization theorem for surfaces
with @xmath , mimicking in a precise sense the discrete uniformization
proof.

### 9 The Random Energies

#### 9.1 Triangulation Deformations

The key to computing the need expected values in section 2 is to compute
how an angle in a triangle deforms under a conformal change of metric.
The method used here is to solve the the boundary value problem for the
geodesics in the @xmath metric, and compare the initial directions. Of
real interest is the case when we have the geodesics forming the edge of
a triangle, so I will phrase the results in this language. Using normal
coordinates at the point @xmath in the @xmath metric let the points on
our triangle are labeled @xmath . Further let @xmath for any @xmath and
@xmath and let @xmath be the left handed @xmath rotation of @xmath in
the Euclidean metric. Given that the surface is orientable pick an
orientation and let @xmath be one if @xmath is ordered in the
”clockwise” direction and @xmath if not. Further more let @xmath be the
Gaussian curvature at @xmath and @xmath be Hessian of @xmath in normal
coordinates (which are denoted via @xmath ).

###### Lemma 29

In the above notation the initial direction of a geodesic from @xmath to
@xmath in the @xmath metric is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proof: For the purposes of readable notation let @xmath , and note we
may rewrite our initial starting direction as @xmath .

The new metric in normal coordinate is up to order @xmath given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Recall the geodesic equation is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Using this a metric up to order @xmath the Christoffel symbols are found
to be

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

All the above @xmath derivatives are evaluated at the center of the
circle, @xmath ; and I am letting @xmath denote the curvature a @xmath .
We are solving the boundary value problem where we start at @xmath and
ending a @xmath , i.e. introducing the notation that @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since we know the Christoffel symbols up to @xmath , to analyze the
solution up to order @xmath we may simply linearize the problem form the
point of view of the origin (this can be seen immediately by looking at
the power series expansion). So we need to solve the linear o.d.e.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where b

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For future use it is convenient to note

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now this o.d.e can be solved via variation of parameter via

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with initial condition

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

So up to order @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now we need to find the @xmath and @xmath so that when this is evaluated
a @xmath it is at the point @xmath .

So plugging in @xmath we find we need

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Inverting to isolate @xmath we find (up to order @xmath ) that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Simply plug into this expression the above formulas to arrive at the
claimed formula.

Q.E.D.

Now we are capable of computing the needed angle. It is convenient to
denote the angle in the triangle at the point @xmath in the Euclidean
coordinates as @xmath . With this we have…

###### Lemma 30

The angle in the triangle at @xmath is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proof: For this problem denote the solution to the previous problem as
@xmath . First note that the angle, @xmath , between this initial vector
and @xmath has its cosine given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Hence using the notation of the previous problem and letting @xmath ,
@xmath , and @xmath , we have up to cubic order that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Multiplying out and using @xmath and @xmath up to the third order in
@xmath we have the nice fact that this expression (up to @xmath ) is
independent of the @xmath metric and equal to…

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Using cosine’s power series this allows us to isolate the angle up to
second order as…

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Further note that if one would like this angle to positive if it
contributes to the triangle’s internal angle and negative if not, then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

With this computation out of the way we are left needing to measure the
angle between @xmath and @xmath in the @xmath metric. The trick will be
to measure the angle @xmath from @xmath to @xmath at @xmath and the
angle @xmath from @xmath to @xmath at @xmath , both with the proper
signs as contributers to @xmath , and then sum them up. Let @xmath be
the angle in Euclidean coordinates and @xmath be the Euclidean
innerproduct.

To compute these angle note at @xmath we have @xmath , @xmath , @xmath
and that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now note that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and from this by keeping track of the necessary sign we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

So the above expression is precisely

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

So we have that @xmath , and from this the needed

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now summing up to get @xmath , and so

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Plugging into the formula from the previous lemma now finishes the
computation.

Q.E.D.

#### 9.2 The Energy Computation

Using the angle formula from the previous section I will now compute the
the expected value of the energy, deriving formula 5 and theorem 6 . In
the end we will arrive at the formula

###### Formula 13

For a negative curvature metric @xmath and @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with the @xmath constants.

Proof: To do the computation it is necessary to find the @xmath function
used in theorem 12 with respect to the volume induced random variable.

By changing to the @xmath coordinates we reduce @xmath to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the prism volume associated to the triangle withe angle
data given by the triangle on this surface formed with this data. So we
need to expand

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

in the @xmath variable. To do this it is nice to give our small objects
some names; let @xmath , let @xmath ,and let @xmath . The last of which
is small since

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Note that at this point

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The power series expansion of minus the Lobacevskii function @xmath
about a positive @xmath is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Note from the formula for @xmath in lemma 30 that the @xmath and @xmath
functions are divisible by @xmath so this series when applied to the
first six terms in the above expansion for @xmath gives us a power
series in @xmath with bounded continuous coefficients and a remainder of
order @xmath .

Note that the remaining term is in the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Given this expression it is extremely useful to get a grip on the
expression @xmath .

###### Lemma 31

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proof:

Let @xmath represent a pair where @xmath .

We can begin with the observations that @xmath , and that since both
@xmath and @xmath include all ordered pairs

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

To compute explicitly the remaining terms the following fact useful:

###### Fact 6

If @xmath is a symmetric @xmath matrix then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Using these observations, the above fact, the fact that the angle in the
Euclidean triangle sum to zero, and the fact that @xmath , we find the
sum is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

as needed.

Q.E.D. (lemma)

It is worth noting as a confirmation to the previous sections
computation, this is lemma is exactly what one expects from the the
Gauss Bonnet formula when @xmath .

With this in mind we see that in fact the expansion for @xmath has terms
of the form @xmath for @xmath and @xmath for @xmath with continuous
coefficient functions. So up to order @xmath @xmath is of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

With this we are in position to apply theorem 12 . Note that @xmath . So
using the notation of the previous section we have the @xmath from
theorem and we get

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (14)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (15)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (16)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (20)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

Now we attempt to compute @xmath . The first one clearly can be
integrated to a constant times the surfaces area, @xmath , where the
constant is independent of any of the geometry or topology.

Happily enough @xmath . This follows immediately form the first part of
the following integral vanishing lemma ( after noting @xmath ):

###### Lemma 32

Let @xmath and @xmath be either @xmath or @xmath functions then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proof: The idea is simply to note in each case that there are symmetric
regions of the @xmath cube where the function has opposite signs (the
finiteness once again follows form the integrability of the
logarithmatic singularity). I’ll simply indicate the symmetries.

One key observation is that @xmath and @xmath are invariant the
transformation, @xmath , were for each @xmath @xmath goes to @xmath
modulo @xmath ; and the transformation @xmath sending all @xmath to
@xmath modulo @xmath negates @xmath while of course leaving @xmath
invariant.

Now note for the first integral either @xmath of @xmath will produce the
needed symmetry. For the second integral @xmath alone will work. The
Remain integrals have the order four transformation @xmath producing the
four points - two of each possible sign.

Q.E.D. (lemma)

In @xmath note that after integrating the Laplacian term in equation 16
integrates away and the @xmath term integrates to an Euler
characteristic - so in the end we get a constant times the Euler
characteristic @xmath , with @xmath depending on none of the geometry of
@xmath or topology of @xmath .

@xmath can be broken up into the four pieces as in its formula (equation
20 – 20 ). The first piece (equation 20 ) can as above be integrated out
to give @xmath , with @xmath depending only on the Euler characteristic.

The last two equations ( 20 and 20 ) can be explicitly integrated to
give

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This leaves equation 20 involving the @xmath . Looking at the expression
for @xmath we see that the integral vanishing lemma immediately gives us
that these terms integrate away to zero, with exception of the terms in
the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

However the last integral in the vanishing lemma tells us that these
integral are equal. So as in the previous piece we are left with a term
which integrates out to @xmath .

So using theorem 12 our energy is now indeed in the claimed form.

Q.E.D. (formula 13 )

Now we can compute the energy in formula 5 simply by noting that the
terms in the formula with @xmath constants in them cancel (in the
prelimit even) and that we are left precisely with the needed terms.
Also noter the formula for @xmath is immediate. With these we can verify
the formula for @xmath and prove theorem 6 .

Proof (theorem 6 ) It is immediate that amongst metrics of the same
area, @xmath , that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We now state the beautiful formula do to Polyakov (see [ 13 ] or [ 2 ] )
for the the determinant of the Laplacian

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Plugging in above we arrive at the needed

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which is the claimed formula.

Q.E.D

### 10 A Proof of the Uniformization Theorem

The goal here is to give the proof of the metric uniformization theorem
indicated in section 2 . It is a direct analog in infinite dimensions of
the proof of the angle system uniformization presented in section 4.4 .
To see this it is useful to organize the finite dimensional proof into 4
basic steps, which will be mimicked amongst metrics.

#### 10.1 The Discrete Uniformization Proof Reviewed

The negative curvature Delaunay angle system uniformization proof:

Step 0. We defined what what we called the negative curvature Delaunay
angle systems conformal to a fixed angle system @xmath and called it
@xmath , which turns out to be nice convex set. Then we placed upon it
an energy @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which was continuous on @xmath .

Step 1. Now we observed that at least one point of maximum energy must
exist, here by the rather trivial observation that space @xmath upon
which our continuous energy lives is in fact compact.

Step 2. At this step we showed that any @xmath where @xmath assumes its
maximal value is in fact in @xmath . To accomplish this recall we took a
point @xmath on the boundary of @xmath and constructed a line @xmath
satisfying @xmath and that there is an @xmath such that for all @xmath
we have that @xmath and @xmath is increasing in @xmath . Clearly now the
continuity of @xmath on @xmath makes it impossible for @xmath to assume
its maximum value at any boundary point.

Step 3. At this step we verified that any point @xmath where @xmath is
maximal is in fact a uniform angle system. This followed immediately by
examining what the differential of @xmath vanishing at @xmath implied
about @xmath (see observation 4 ).

Step 4. We proved uniqueness of the point @xmath where @xmath achieves
its maximum. To do this we took a second point @xmath and connected it
with a line @xmath to our @xmath and note that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for all @xmath such that @xmath remains in @xmath . So @xmath could not
also be maximal (see lemma 4 ).

#### 10.2 The Indiscreet Proof

The proof in the previous section can be carried out in the indiscreet
world step by step.

Step 0. We need the correct analogs of an @xmath and @xmath on which to
interpret the energy

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Namely which @xmath do we use to conformally change our initial metric.
Clearly a rescaling will change nothing both since it effects no angles
in the discrete model and since @xmath is clearly scale invariant on
@xmath . In fact with this in mind we should feel free to re-scale the
initial metric and for convenience let’s assume it area is @xmath . One
way to eliminate the possibility of rescaling is to demand

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We’d also like to restrict to @xmath with negative curvature, i.e.
@xmath . So the first guess at a reasonable function space might be

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

However the energy on here would make using a compactness argument in
step 1 rather difficult. The trick to producing a place where a
compactness argument will work is to take the closure of @xmath with
respect to a norm which @xmath interacts with in a sensible way. The
energy being convex in fact means we can essentially close @xmath under
the energy viewed as a norm. Such Banach space are well studied and
called Sobolev-Orlicz spaces.

##### 10.2.1 A BRIEF introduction to Sobolev-Orlicz spaces

In this section we recall several well known theorems concerning Banach
spaces and in particular the Sobolev-Orlicz spaces.

One of the key uses of Sobolev-Orlicz spaces (introduced below) is to
produce Banach spaces @xmath where we have no control over @xmath growth
for @xmath yet are still able to represent @xmath as the dual of a
second Banach space, i.e. @xmath . Recall that Gel’fand’s theorem tell
us that even @xmath cannot be realized a the dual of any Banach space,
so @xmath would not do.

The reason we would like @xmath is that such a relation gives us
sensible notions of compactness in the weak topology on @xmath .

###### Theorem 13 (Alaglu’s Theorem)

A closed and bounded set in the norm topology is weak compact.

To identify such set’s we will recall on of the most well known
convexity theorems, namely…

###### Theorem 14 (Mazur’s Theorem)

A closed and convex set in @xmath is also closed in the weak topology.

For proof’s of these results see [ 11 ] . Now let’s produce the spaces
with the @xmath property to which these theorems will apply.

An Orlicz space is an @xmath type space using a different convex
function than @xmath . In fact its good to specify the class of convex
functions on @xmath (the Young functions) of use here. A young function
is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath satisfies

1.  @xmath for @xmath

2.  @xmath is left continuous

3.  @xmath is non-decreasing on @xmath

4.  @xmath .

We would like to form a norm which behaves something like

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In fact the space of function with satisfy @xmath will be essential to
us, and we will denote it @xmath .

To actually implement this we take what you can of the inverse of @xmath
, namely let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and call it the the Orlicz conjugate of @xmath .

Perhaps the most important example in this context are the following
conjugate relationships….

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

With these notions let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then this forms a norm on the space of measurable function with @xmath
(call it @xmath ).

The @xmath come in two flavors the happy ones which satisfy the
existence a @xmath and @xmath such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the sad ones which don’t. Notice @xmath is happy and it conjugate
@xmath is not.

Let @xmath be the closure of @xmath in @xmath under this norm. For happy
@xmath we have that @xmath is a separable Banach space and that the norm
interacts with @xmath nicely. For example if @xmath then @xmath (this is
a special consequence of what is known as mean convergence) For sad
@xmath we have @xmath and that these inclusions are always proper, also
@xmath fails to be separable and @xmath fails to even be a vector space.

@xmath and @xmath are reflexive if and only if @xmath and @xmath are
happy. However it is alway the case that @xmath , the key property
discussed in the first paragraph of this section.

With these space the Sobolev-Orlicz spaces are easy understood. I will
only present and need a very special case, but everything here works in
complete generality (see the very nice [ 7 ] ). We will embed @xmath
into @xmath via @xmath and take its closure in the Banach norm. We
arrive a Banach space @xmath . Just as above even though @xmath is bad
we can realize @xmath as @xmath were @xmath is the closure of @xmath in
@xmath under the same embedding.

Its worth noting at this point that we in fact have certain obvious
continuous inclusions of the classical Sobolev spaces. Let @xmath be the
usual Sobolev space where we control the @xmath norm of the first @xmath
derivatives. With these we clearly have have the following continuous
inclusions

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This fact gives us some nice functions in @xmath . Namely we have the
Fredholm Alternative assuring us that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

so for any mean zero @xmath function @xmath we can construct a function
in @xmath such that @xmath .

The last fact is a certain set inclusion, namely

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In particular the mapping @xmath such that @xmath takes @xmath into
@xmath for all @xmath and @xmath into @xmath . I will refer to this fact
as Trudinger’s inequality.

##### 10.2.2 Step zero continued

With our introduction to the needed spaces out of the way we may proceed
with step zero by letting @xmath be the closure of @xmath in @xmath ,
and @xmath the subset of this where @xmath . One key property of the
space @xmath in this context is that @xmath . so by Mazur’s theorem the
convex set @xmath is closed in both the norm and weak topologies. The
remainder of step one can be summed up in the following lemma assuring
the continuity of @xmath .

###### Lemma 33

@xmath is continuous on @xmath in both the norm topology and weak
topologies.

proof: To see the norm topology case let @xmath implies @xmath converges
to @xmath in the @xmath norm. So @xmath will converge to @xmath as well,
since @xmath . In particular since the @xmath norm is happy we have
@xmath . Now observe that on @xmath @xmath differs from @xmath by a
continuous and bounded function. So by the fact that the norm
convergence implies @xmath convergence we have from the dominated
convergence theorem that @xmath as needed.

The weak topology assertion follows from the fact that @xmath is convex
on @xmath hence a convex function on its closure, so in the norm
topology @xmath is closed and convex hence by Mazur’s theorem closed in
the weak topology.

q.e.d

Step 1. Now we would like to proceed as in the discrete case and use a
compactness arguments to assert the existence of a function achieving
the maximum. Since @xmath is not quite compact in this case, we must do
a little work to see that it is compact enough. The first thing to note
is

###### Lemma 34

@xmath .

Proof: The boundedness of @xmath on @xmath follows form the fact that
for any @xmath that @xmath since @xmath is the @xmath limit of @xmath
functions with this property. So we have that by Jensen’s inequality
that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This along wit the obvious fact that @xmath gives us the needed bound.

q.e.d

Denote the finite number @xmath as @xmath . From the lemma 33 on the
continuity of @xmath in the weak topology @xmath is weak closed and
convex. In fact @xmath is weak compact. To see this it is enough by
Alaglu’s theorem to see that the norm is bounded on @xmath . By Poincare
inequality @xmath so

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now just as in the discrete world we have a continuous function, @xmath
, on a compact set @xmath and hence we have at least one point achieving
the maximum value.

Step 2. Now just as in the discrete case we need to control the
boundary. Suppose a maximum occurs on the boundary at @xmath . Just as
in the discrete case we will construct a direction @xmath and a line
@xmath is contained in @xmath such that @xmath for all @xmath for some
@xmath ; hence contradicting the maximality of @xmath .

@xmath being on the boundary implies that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

has measure @xmath for all @xmath . Now since @xmath there is certainly
an interval @xmath such that @xmath and the set @xmath has measure
@xmath . For each @xmath let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Note by the Fredholm alternative that there is a @xmath such that @xmath
, and further more by altering this function with a constant that one
can assume @xmath . Using this @xmath direction we see that for small
enough @xmath that indeed @xmath is in @xmath and that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since @xmath tends to @xmath as @xmath tends to zero we see that for
small enough that @xmath that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

can be made a large as we’d like. Note that in @xmath we have @xmath is
bounded and hence by the Green’s function representation of @xmath we
have that @xmath is bounded simultaneously for all small enough @xmath .
So indeed @xmath can be chosen so @xmath for small @xmath . So boundary
maxima are impossible, and we have an internal maxima.

Step 3. So now we have that our point of maximal energy is internal.
Note at such a maxima @xmath in essential supremum so @xmath . Using
@xmath as above we see for each @xmath such that @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

So @xmath is a constant as an @xmath function. In particular
exponentiating we see that @xmath is a constant. In fact note

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and by Trudinger’s inequality @xmath so @xmath by elliptic regularity.
So @xmath and by elliptic regularity again @xmath . Continuing this
@xmath and hence @xmath are in fact in all @xmath and hence by the
Sobolev embedding theorem in @xmath .

Step 4. Now we can easily get uniqueness in the @xmath case, exactly as
in the discrete case. Take two now @xmath solution @xmath and @xmath and
note form the second Frech’et derivative that the line @xmath in @xmath
connecting them satisfies

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for all @xmath with @xmath in @xmath . So as in the discrete case the
point of maximum energy is unique.

## Chapter \thechapter Spheres and Tori

This chapter is dedicated to exploring the ideas of the previous
chapters in the cases of @xmath . The cases of primary interest are the
torus and sphere cases. As in the @xmath case the fundamental object
needing exploration is the class of polyhedra related to a
triangulations, and the volume energy associated to this class. In both
cases there is an intrinsic class of such polyhedra but the story
presented here in the @xmath case experiences difficulties. The nature
of the difficulties is very different for the torus and the sphere.

In the toroidal case the class of polyhedra needed has been studied in
the literature in [ 3 ] and [ 14 ] , and the issues in chapter two have
already been essentially dealt with. I will remind the reader of the
issues involved in section 11 , and for now only highlight the
differences with the @xmath case. In the torus case the energy is
significantly easier to deal with and analogs to theorem 7 and theorem 9
exist and can be proved with the same methods. However the story is
different in the important respect that the linear part of the problem
sends one immediately into the land of zero curvature world, a phenomena
which occurs in both the discrete and continuous cases. So in the
continuous metric case there is no non-linear metric story at all. This
case in fact demonstrates the important fact that perhaps a better
continuous analog of the discrete world would be a connection or an
affine like structure. This because, as we shall see, the discrete
uniformization does not produce flat structures, but rather affine
structures. In any case the ideas of chapter three breaks down at a
rather fundamental level.

The spherical case is quite the opposite, and on some level the ideas
don’t break down at all. As in the @xmath cases there is an appropriate
class of “intrinsic” polyhedra, and the one gets a natural volume energy
which has critical points precisely at uniform structures. Unlike in the
toroidal case the randomization goes through perfectly to produce an
energy on the positive curvature metrics. Every thing looks good except
now the energy is no longer nice at all. Analogs the theorem 7 and 9
exist (see [ 15 ] ) but appear much harder to prove with the intrinsic
methods used in the @xmath case. In particular the energy fails to be
convex and the boundary behavior becomes very difficult to control. In
fact both the discrete and continuous proofs of the previous chapter
fail in fundamental ways. Of course intrinsic proofs may still exist,
but as is often the case with spherical uniformization (see [ 2 ] and [
9 ] ) will involved significantly more drama.

### 11 The Toroidal Case

In the discrete toroidal world one must first replace @xmath with angle
systems which have zero rather than negative curvature. This of course
gives us a significantly smaller space of angles and in particular the
conformal deformations preserve not only the @xmath but also this
curvature condition, and are the span of the @xmath vectors in figure 24
over all the vertices.

To construct the polyhedra first view the Euclidean plane as the
boundary at infinity of hyperbolic space in the upper-half space model.
The polyhedra are now constructed by taking the union of the ideal
simplexes over each of the Euclidean triangles. Note the energy formula
in the @xmath agrees with this construction and becomes twice the sum of
the volumes of all the ideal tetrahedra over a fundamental domain. As
before the volume is simply the sum of the volumes of the ideal
tetrahedra corresponding to the individual Euclidean triangle angles in
the angle system. In other words

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where if @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This energy remains convex and boundary controllable and all of chapter
two carries over with the most interesting point being why at the
critical points of @xmath fit together.

###### Observation 6

At a critical point of @xmath the triangles fit together to form an
affine structure on the torus.

Proof: As far as I’m aware the idea in this proof has its origin in
Bragger’s [ 3 ] . The above formula tells us that from the formula for
the Lobacevskii function we have @xmath with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

So at a critical point with @xmath faces @xmath in its flower at @xmath
and angles labeled @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now lets attempt to fix our edge lengths. We will denote the edge length
opposite to @xmath as @xmath . Each triangle can be scaled with its
angles preserved since we are in the Euclidean plane. So fix the size of
@xmath . Now scale @xmath so that @xmath . Continue this until the size
of @xmath has been fixed.

Now from the law of @xmath s @xmath gives us

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

So the entire flower fits together.

Now we have open sets which are affine related in overlaps, so an affine
structure.

q.e.d

With this observation the other ideas essentially work out in the same
way.

### 12 The Spherical Case

The initial discrete set up for the sphere is identical to the @xmath
case except the use of positive rather than negative curvature. The
class polyhedra is very simple to construct. Given a triangulation of
the sphere take the convex hull of the vertices. The volume formula
turns out to once again agree with the negative curvature case. This is
quite a nice fact. To see it view the sphere at infinity in the ball
model from the origin. Note form this view point the angles you see in
the ideal polyhedra are precisely the angles in the triangulation as the
sphere understands them. Now for each triangle on the sphere at infinity
with @xmath form the three ideal vertexes tetrahedra by taking the
convex hull of the these vertices at infinity with the origin, see
figure 25 .

###### Fact 7

The volume of the above tetrahedra @xmath is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proof: To see this extend the geodesics in the tetrahedra and take the
convex hull of this arrangement. We get an ideal octahedron. Using the
three new points at infinity and the origin note we have in this
octahedron a symmetric copy of our original three ideal vertexed
tetrahedra.

Each edge @xmath of the octahedron corresponds to an ideal tetrahedra
@xmath , see figure 26 where three particularly relevant tetrahedra are
labeled. Now simply note that by using both copies of the three ideal
vertexed tetrahedra that the needed volume can be expressed as half of
@xmath . Now the fact that an ideal tetrahedra has its volume given by
summing the Lobacevskii function over the angles meeting at a vertex
gives the needed formula. q.e.d

Note by spherical geometry that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

so the same exact computation as in the @xmath case tells us a critical
point is uniform. However convexity and boundary control are both lost,
and since we may use the same formula as in section 4.4 this is easy to
see. The random computation goes through as in the @xmath case, and we
can see immediately from formula 6 that we lose convexity.

It is worth noting that we should have expected problems, at least with
uniqueness. Namely there is a sort of Gauge group sitting around, and in
the metric world it corresponds to the fact there are conformal
transformation of the standard sphere which fail to be isometries. In
fact given a uniform metric there is a three dimension space of distinct
@xmath which remain constant curvature. This is fun to witness in terms
of triangulations where it indicates that we may expect distinct sets of
angles to be be conformally equivalent and still fit together. To see it
fix the vertexes of a triangulation and move what we view as the origin
of hyperbolic space in the above construction away form the balls origin
in the model. Then moving it back to the model’s origin produces a
topologically equivalent triangulation with distinct angles which
clearly fits together. Although this observation is unfairly mixing our
two notion of conformal change it is still indicates that uniqueness of
a uniform structures in the discrete world should not be common.

## Chapter \thechapter Appendix: A Less Pleasant Proof of Lemma 1

Here I will present an alternate proof of lemma 1 , and arrive at the
slightly stronger condition of needing circles to only be on disks of
radius less than @xmath rather than on circles of radius less than
@xmath as in section 3.1.2.

The trick to this proof of lemma is to understand the curves satisfying
@xmath ; with @xmath with less than @xmath . This because any point on
such a curve corresponds to the center of a circle going through both
@xmath and @xmath , and if a triple @xmath lives on a circle then the
corresponding curves for each pair in the triple must intersect at the
the point corresponding to the center of this circle.

Before getting started there are a few basics pieces of notation
convenient to introduce here: if @xmath call @xmath the shortest length
geodesic segment between @xmath and @xmath (it is well defined by lemma
), and let @xmath be the connected component of the geodesic contained
in any set we happen to be exploring with @xmath in it. For example
relative to @xmath , @xmath is the geodesic splitting @xmath into its
two distinct “sides” (simply look in normal coordinates). Denote as
@xmath the two components of @xmath . We will also find it useful to
name the midpoint of @xmath - called it @xmath . (see figure for
periodic notation reminders). For the remainder of this section denote
@xmath as @xmath , since the differential is usually represented with a
@xmath .

To get started it is in fact useful to consider the more general curve
of the type @xmath , were @xmath . By the implicit function theorem when
@xmath and is defined, the solution to this equation is locally a curve
@xmath with @xmath ; where @xmath satisfies @xmath . In fact any such
curve will parameterize a solution. It is useful to rephrase this one
form business in terms of its dual object the gradient. Recall the
gradient of a function @xmath is the unique vector field @xmath
satisfying @xmath for all @xmath at every point. So we may rewrite our
differential relation @xmath as @xmath .

To get a grip on this differential relation it is first useful to spend
a moment contemplating @xmath .

###### Sub-lemma 2 (The Distance Gradient Sub-lemma)

Let @xmath then:

1.   In @xmath we have @xmath is unit length with its integral curves
    the unit speed geodesics.

2.   In @xmath we have @xmath on @xmath , @xmath on @xmath ; and outside
    @xmath we have @xmath for any @xmath .

@xmath For the first part note the distance function’s level sets are
the spheres, so by Gauss’s lemma its integral curves are some
re-parameterizations of geodesics from @xmath . Now observe in geodesic
polar coordinates that the unit speed geodesics @xmath satisfies @xmath
, and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

So indeed the integral curve of @xmath are precisely the unit speed
geodesics.

The equalities in the second part follows immediately from the first
part and the fact @xmath is a geodesic.

To prove the last piece of the second part assume at some @xmath we have
@xmath . First note from the above we have @xmath . There are two cases,
first we’ll deal with @xmath . Since the geodesics satisfy a second
order O.D.E they are uniquely determined by their position and tangent
vector, so when @xmath we have both the geodesic from @xmath and the
geodesic form @xmath are the same curves. Without loss of generality
@xmath is further away than @xmath and this point lies along the same
minimal length geodesic (of length less than @xmath ) which connects
@xmath and @xmath , i.e. @xmath . In the case @xmath we can follow the
geodesic form @xmath to the point and then from the point back to @xmath
forming a geodesic of length less than @xmath - which then must by lemma
be the unique such one, i.e. @xmath .

q.e.d

Back to the relation @xmath . The first observation is that we can
express a solution of this relation via a vector field. Using @xmath
rotation field @xmath (from section 1.1) we see that the solution to the
differential relation @xmath are re-parameterizations of integral curves
of the vector field @xmath . Fortunately, as with @xmath , we can say
quite a bit about this vector field. We are most interested in its
integral curve corresponding to @xmath . Let @xmath be the connected
component of the integral curve of @xmath passing through @xmath in any
set of interest to us; and assume its parameterization satisfies @xmath
.

###### Lemma 35 (The Distance Difference Gradient Lemma)

Assume @xmath then:

1.   In @xmath we have that @xmath is the unique component of @xmath ,
    and @xmath is the unique point of @xmath on @xmath .

2.   In @xmath we have @xmath and @xmath strictly increase as the
    parameter @xmath increases.

3.   No geodesic from @xmath in @xmath is tangent to @xmath or cuts
    trough @xmath twice on the same side of @xmath .

4.   In @xmath it can never be the case that @xmath at a point on @xmath
    .

@xmath First for the uniqueness of @xmath : suppose a point @xmath is
@xmath . Then @xmath is within @xmath of @xmath - hence @xmath is
determined by the length of the segment of @xmath form @xmath to @xmath
, similarly for @xmath (using @xmath ). Now note that as we move from
@xmath toward, say, @xmath that @xmath decreases while @xmath increase -
so @xmath at another point of @xmath . When on @xmath say above @xmath
the segment of @xmath from @xmath to @xmath in fact covers the shorter
segment from @xmath to @xmath - forcing @xmath once again. So @xmath
cannot satisfy @xmath , forcing @xmath to indeed be the unique point of
@xmath on @xmath .

The remainder of the first part and the second part are intimately
related. To see why we first look at the component of @xmath in @xmath
and note any component of @xmath would have to have a point closest to
@xmath . This closest point is tangent to a sphere emanating form @xmath
. The same sort of phenomena must take place for the distance function
to have a critical point; namely if a point @xmath along any integral
curve of @xmath is a critical point of the distance function @xmath then
either @xmath or a circle is tangent to the solution curve. In the
tangent case @xmath , or rather @xmath ; so both these situation we have
forced the case @xmath . The triangle inequality tells @xmath so we may
use sub-lemma to note that the point where this occurs is on @xmath ;
but from above to be on @xmath and @xmath means you must be exactly
@xmath . So we have both that every component of @xmath in @xmath
contains @xmath , and that the distance to @xmath parameterized by
@xmath can have no critical points except at @xmath (similarly for
@xmath ).

For the third part note that if a geodesic cuts twice on the same side
of @xmath then some other geodesic must be tangent (via the mean value
theorem in geodesic polar coordinates - see the see figure ).

So we are reduced to the tangent case. Let the point where this tangency
occurs be called @xmath . This tangency implies @xmath , or rather
@xmath . But @xmath and @xmath are orthogonal, with @xmath also of unit
length (by sub-lemma ) - so taking norms we have @xmath ; forcing @xmath
. So at such a point @xmath or @xmath . Once again using @xmath the
above sub-lemma applies and forces @xmath onto @xmath ; and now part one
kicks in to eliminate this possibility of @xmath hitting @xmath .

To prove the last part we will see first if @xmath at @xmath , then
@xmath and @xmath at @xmath . This because the @xmath are all unit
vectors (by sub-lemma part one); and among unit vectors @xmath and
@xmath the direction of @xmath is uniquely determined by @xmath (since
we are re-parameterizing the radius one circle at located a @xmath ).
Recall from the above sub-lemma that @xmath at @xmath implies @xmath .
As above, no point of @xmath can be on @xmath , as needed.

q.e.d

The last set of issues concerns not the @xmath curves themselves but the
home of the curves. Suppose we have three points @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath on the boundary of circles of radius @xmath less than @xmath ;
then using @xmath and @xmath we can split @xmath into four cones (as in
figure ). Let the forward length cone (FLC) be the cone containing
@xmath , the backward length cone (BLC) be the forward length cone’s
mirror image (see figure and the following lemma to see this is well
defined). One nice thing about this cone notion is that it eliminates
certain regions where the center of a small circle might have wanted to
live - and it is at this point where we find the only place in the
argument where using the strong convexity radius is necessary. We shall
explore these facts (and clear up an issue in the introduction) with the
following corollary to lemma in section 1.2:

###### Lemma 36 (The Length Cone Lemma)

Given three points @xmath , @xmath and @xmath on the boundary of a
circle of radius @xmath less than @xmath centered at @xmath :

1.   The forward length cone is well defined.

2.   The intersection of the three forward length cones is a triangle
    contained in @xmath ; which, incidentally, can be parameterized in a
    way compatible with the abstract gluing to form @xmath (see figure
    ).

3.   The @xmath is dissected by the curves @xmath into seven regions -
    the unique FLC, three distinct BLCs, and the regions separating the
    BLCs (see in figure ).

4.   If in addition the balls radius is less than @xmath , then circle’s
    center cannot be in any of the backward length cones, and the
    simplex is contained in @xmath .

Proof: In the course of the this proof I use the triangle inequality in
the sense of @xmath then @xmath . I will simply call it the triangle
inequality.

First we attack well definedness of the FLC. Since the radius of the
circle is less than @xmath we have by the triangle inequality @xmath and
@xmath are in @xmath , and that @xmath . Now note @xmath is contained in
@xmath - since if it left @xmath then by the triangle inequality it
would be a curve from @xmath to @xmath leaving @xmath and then
afterwards entering @xmath , so would have length greater than @xmath ;
contradicting @xmath . We would now like this geodesic segment to stays
in one cone section. If it did not then it would cut a bounding
geodesic, @xmath or @xmath , in at least two points on the cone’s
boundary. Now the diameter geodesics are of length less than @xmath , so
between @xmath and @xmath we now have contradictory distinct geodesics
of length less than @xmath connecting them. So the cone is well defined.

To get started on the second part first simply parameterize the needed
simplex. Note we may choose @xmath and @xmath such that @xmath and
@xmath bound the FLC, and by the first argument @xmath so any point on
@xmath has its shortest length geodesics from @xmath described by @xmath
with @xmath . The fact there are no double intersections of short
geodesics now demonstrates that each @xmath with @xmath hits exactly one
point on @xmath , so we can parameterize @xmath as @xmath - with @xmath
continuous. Now we have a homeomorphism (once again since there are not
double intersection between small geodesics) of the region trapped
between the geodesics with the wedge @xmath and @xmath . This wedge is
clearly homeomorphic to the disk. However to parameterize the triangle
we would like a parameterization which is compatible with the abstract
gluing, allowing @xmath to be continuous. To accomplish this first
parameterize the edges with the unit interval using a @xmath speed
parameterization of the geodesic. Now for each triangle in the surface
we will map on an equilateral triangle by first mapping the boundary of
our triangle to the boundary of our simplex @xmath such that the linear
unit length sides are mapped onto the geodesics at a speed of @xmath .
We have just found that the image is in fact itself the boundary of a
disk, so this mapping can be extended from a homeomorphism of the
equilateral triangle’s boundary to a homeomorphism of the equilateral
triangle onto the triangle in @xmath . So by its very construction the
mapping on the boundary of the equilateral triangle is affine related to
the mapping of the interval, and we indeed have the needed compatible
parameterizations.

We also need for this second part that this is the same simplex for all
three of the points, but by the very definition of the FLC with respect
to a point being the cone section containing the opposite @xmath we have
that the FLC must contain this simplex. So the simplex is in the
intersection - and precisely the intersection since the respective
@xmath curves all cut their respective @xmath balls in to two distinct
sides - and by the triangle inequality this entire discussion is taking
place in any one of the radius @xmath balls.

Lastly for the second part we need the simplex is contained in @xmath
ball. To see this note from above that every point, @xmath , in the
simplex is on a geodesic, from say @xmath , of length less than @xmath
which hits @xmath . If @xmath is within @xmath of @xmath then @xmath is
with in @xmath of @xmath . If not it is within @xmath of @xmath . The
geodesic segment @xmath has length less than @xmath , so the point where
the geodesic from @xmath hits @xmath is within @xmath of either @xmath
or @xmath ; so @xmath is once again with in @xmath of @xmath - as
needed.

For the third part note that by the triangle inequality a geodesic
between two points in @xmath is contained in the ball must be of length
less than @xmath (use the sense of the triangle inequality introducing
this proof at a point were the geodesic first hits @xmath ). Now extend
all the geodesic segments bounding the simplex out to the boundary in
@xmath ; and note, having length less than @xmath these segments can
intersect each other only once - at the vertices of the simplex (by part
2 above the simplex is in there). So noting the definitions of all of
our objects we indeed end up decomposing @xmath into the seven
components pictured in the figure.

For the final part, the fact that the simplex is contained in @xmath is
a trivial consequences of the @xmath curves having interior in this ball
and never intersecting each other with in the ball. To handle the
center’s placement, assume the contrary that the center, @xmath , is in
the backward length cone with respect to say @xmath . Then take the
shortest length geodesic from @xmath to @xmath and continue it through
the forward length cone until it hits @xmath at @xmath . Note this is a
geodesic of length less than @xmath , so in particular it is the unique
shortest length geodesic between these points. By assumption @xmath and
@xmath are on the boundary of a disk at @xmath with radius less than
@xmath , so by strong convexity @xmath . In particular the shortest
length geodesic to @xmath never leaves @xmath , contradicting the fact
it hit @xmath before @xmath . So the center must not be in the backward
length cone.

q.e.d

We are finally in a position to prove the small disk uniqueness theorem
form the introduction (theorem ).

Proof of Theorem 1 : As above call the points in the triple @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath , and recall @xmath . The whole discussion takes place
with @xmath , since @xmath . In particular the whole discussion takes
place at points where we can use lemmas and . Note a circle of radius
less than @xmath passing through all three of these points corresponds
to an intersection of @xmath and @xmath (by part one of lemma ). Further
note if @xmath and @xmath intersect at @xmath then so does @xmath ,
since then @xmath .

At these intersections we would like that the curves must cut through
each other; i.e. not be tangent. If a pair were tangent then there are
two possibilities: one where neither of the tangent curves is stopped
when thought of as a parameterized integral curve, and the other when
one has stopped ( @xmath ). If neither has stopped then (up to index
permutation) @xmath , or rather @xmath . This case implies by lemma that
we are on @xmath . If one is stopped then (once again up to index
permutation) @xmath . So by sub-lemma the point of intersection is on
@xmath . Be warned - I will refer to this same case analysis later in
the argument. To finish off this impossibility argument simply note that
all the curves intersect at this point so (up to index permutation)
@xmath and @xmath would intersect. But by part one of lemma this point
must then be @xmath which is not on @xmath . So the intersection must
include no tangencies.

Now suppose we had two distinct circles of radius less then @xmath
passing through these triples. This non-uniqueness of circles would
correspond to at least a pair of intersections of @xmath , @xmath , and
@xmath - at @xmath and @xmath . Note without loss of generality there
are no further intersections of any pair of @xmath curves between @xmath
and @xmath ; since intersections occur only as triples at isolated
possible distances by the above no tangency result. Hence we are forced
to have a picture something very much like figure , at least in the
sense that we have one of the curves trapped between the other two;
without loss of generality assume this curve is @xmath .

Note @xmath , so @xmath and @xmath are always on opposite sides of
@xmath ; in the sense that the @xmath component of these vectors must
have opposite signs. Now since the curves must cut through each other at
@xmath and @xmath and no where in between, the side of @xmath which
@xmath and @xmath live on must switch roles while one moves along @xmath
from @xmath to @xmath . In order for these roles to switch and the
vectors to always be on opposite sides, we are forced (as with our no
tangency result above) to have at some point along @xmath either @xmath
, @xmath , or @xmath . Immediately, the last part of lemma kicks in
eliminating the first case.

The remaining case (up to index permutation) is were @xmath - which
means this point lies on @xmath (by the sub lemma). We will be
justifying each of the two pictured cases - depending on which component
of @xmath the point lies (figure and figure ). The idea in each case is
this same - we will use this condition to force one of the centers
@xmath into a backward length cone with respect to either @xmath or
@xmath , and then use the previous lemma to observe this is impossible.

Observe by the first and third parts of lemma that @xmath cannot be
tangent to or cut twice any geodesic in the picture; and @xmath cannot
sneak around a geodesic in the picture (since the decomposition in the
third part of lemma has each of the geodesics heading all the way out to
@xmath ). So in the first case the @xmath is stuck to the right of
@xmath and must cross @xmath to the right and can never cross it again.
So one of the @xmath is stuck in the backwards length cone of @xmath as
needed. The other case is similar to this except we must justify why we
must come from above and cross into the backward length cone with
respect to @xmath . This is because to come from below would mean to cut
across @xmath first to get there producing a double cut of @xmath by
@xmath to left of @xmath , contradicting part 3 of lemma . So indeed
once again we are forced into the contradictory setting of having a
center in a backward length, this time with respect to @xmath .

So the points @xmath and @xmath cannot simultaneously exist - and there
is no non-uniqueness among small circles.
