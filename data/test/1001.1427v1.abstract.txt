Critical phenomena in gravitational collapse opened a new mathematical
vista into the theory of general relativity and may ultimately entail
fundamental physical implication in observations. However, at present,
the dynamics of critical phenomena in gravitational collapse scenarios
are still largely unknown. My thesis seeks to understand the properties
of the threshold in the solution space of the Einstein field equations
between the black hole and neutron star phases, understand the
properties of the neutron star critical solution and clarify the
implication of these results on realistic astrophysical scenarios. We
develop a new set of neutron star-like initial data to establish the
universality of the neutron star critical solution and analyze the
structure of neutron star and neutron star-like critical collapses via
the study of the phase spaces. We also study the different time scales
involved in the neutron star critical solution and analyze the
properties of the critical index via comparisons between neutron star
and neutron star-like initial data. Finally, we explore the boundary of
the attraction basin of the neutron star critical solution and its
transition to a known set of non-critical fixed points.
