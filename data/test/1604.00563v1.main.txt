    latitudinal dependence of a double-ring bipolar pair. Variation of
    strengths for positive ( @xmath ) and negative ( @xmath ) ring with
    colatitude is shown in red and blue colour respectively.

    double-ring algorithm: Poloidal field line contour of double-rings
    in both northern and southern hemisphere. (b) Radial profile of mean
    field @xmath -coefficient used to model the additional poloidal
    field generation mechanism. Bottom panel: Representative butterfly
    diagram from our solar dynamo model with double ring algorithm,

    is the weak diffuse radial field on solar surface and eruption
    latitudes are denoted by symbols black (“+”) and red (“+”),
    indicating underlying negative and positive toroidal field
    respectively.
-    3.3 The top panel shows typical figure of stochastic fluctuations
    in time in the Babcock-Leighton source term constant K1 at a level
    of 30 % fluctuation with a correlation time of 1 year using our
    random number generating program. Middle panel shows simulated
    butterfly diagram at the base of the convection zone after
    introducing fluctuation in Babcock-Leighton source term without the
    presence of additional mean field @xmath source term. Bottom panel
    shows simulated butterfly diagram at the base of the convection zone
    when both Babcock-Leighton source term and mean field @xmath effect
    is present. In last case we introduce 75 % fluctuation in
    Babcock-Leighton mechanism and 150 % fluctuation in mean field
    @xmath .
-    3.4 First panel shows the time series of yearly averaged sunspot
    area by hemisphere, the second panel is the time series of yearly
    averaged absolute asymmetry generated from observed sunspot area
    data series, the third panel is the wavelet power spectrum of
    absolute asymmetry time series and fourth panel shows the global
    wavelet analysis of absolute asymmetry. Both wavelet power spectrum
    and global wavelet analysis shows a clear signature of 11 year
    periodicity in the absolute asymmetry data generated from
    observation.
-    3.5 Top panel shows the time series of yearly averaged absolute
    asymmetry generated from our kinematic dynamo simulation with
    stochastic fluctuation. In this case we take 60 % fluctuation in the
    Babcock-Leighton mechanism and 50 % fluctuation in mean field @xmath
    -effect. Middle panel and bottom panel shows the wavelet power
    spectrum and global wavelet analysis of this absolute asymmetry time
    series, respectively. Both wavelet power spectrum and global wavelet
    analysis shows a clear signature of 11 year periodicity in the
    absolute asymmetry data generated from the simulations.
-    3.6 First panel shows the evolution of parity (red colour) and 22
    year averaged normalized signed asymmetry (blue color) obtained from
    our simulations. Second, third, fourth and fifth panels are
    simulated butterfly diagrams for different time intervals where
    parity change takes place. Selected time intervals are shown in top
    panel by double arrow. All these plots indicate that a change in
    solar parity takes place only when sunspot activity in one
    hemisphere dominates over the other for a sufficiently large period
    of time. This simulations corresponds to 60% fluctuations in
    Babcock-Leighton mechanism and 50 % fluctuations in mean field
    @xmath .
-    3.7 First panel shows the evolution of parity (red colour) and 22
    year averaged normalized signed asymmetry (blue color) obtained from
    our simulations. Second, third, fourth and fifth panels are
    simulated butterfly diagrams for different time intervals where
    parity change takes place. Selected time intervals are shown in top
    panel by double arrow. These simulations indicate solar cycle parity
    changes take place when activity in one hemisphere dominates over
    the other for a sufficiently large period of time. This simulation
    corresponds to 75% fluctuation in Babcock-Leighton mechanism and 150
    % fluctuation in mean field @xmath .
-    4.1 The outer 45% of the Sun depicting the internal rotation
    profile in color. Faster rotation is denoted in deep red and slower
    rotation in blue. The equator of the Sun rotates faster than the
    polar regions and there is a strong shear layer in the rotation near
    the base of the convection zone (denoted by the dotted line).
    Streamlines of a deep meridional flow (solid black curves) reaching
    below the base of the solar convection zone (dashed line) is shown
    on the left hemisphere, while streamlines of a shallow meridional
    flow confined to the top 10% of the Sun is shown on the right
    hemispheres (arrows indicate direction of flow). Recent observations
    indicate that the meridional flow is much shallower and more complex
    than traditionally assumed, calling in to question a fundamental
    premise of flux transport dynamo models of the solar cycle.
-    4.2 Evolution of the toroidal field when we allow magnetic flux
    tubes to buoyantly erupt from near surface layer i.e. 0.90 @xmath )
    above a critical buoyancy threshold of @xmath Gauss.
-    4.3 Solar cycle simulations with a shallow meridional flow. The
    toroidal (a) and poloidal (b) components of the magnetic field is
    depicted within the computational domain at a phase corresponding to
    cycle maxima. The solar interior shows the existence of two toroidal
    field belts, one at the base of the convection zone and the other at
    near-surface layers where the shallow equatorward meridional
    counterflow is located. Region between two dashed circular arcs
    indicates the tachocline. (c) A butterfly diagram generated at the
    base of convection zone showing the spatiotemporal evolution of the
    toroidal field. Clearly, there is no dominant equatorward
    propagation of the toroidal field belt and the solution displays
    quadrupolar parity (i.e., symmetric toroidal field across the
    equator) which do not agree with observations.
-    4.4 First two plots show the variation of radial pumping @xmath (in
    ms @xmath ) at co-latitudes of northern hemisphere and southern
    hemisphere respectively, with fractional solar radius from the solar
    surface to the solar interior. Radial turbulent pumping is negative
    at both hemisphere. Next two plots show the variation of latitudinal
    pumping @xmath (in ms @xmath ) at @xmath mid latitudes of both
    northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere respectively, with
    fractional solar radius from the solar surface to the solar
    interior. It is positive in northern hemisphere and negative in
    southern hemisphere.
-    4.5 Plot of left side represents the contour plot of radial pumping
    profile and plot of right side represents the contour plot of
    latitudinal pumping profile. In this case, peak value of @xmath and
    @xmath is 0.4 ms @xmath and 1 ms @xmath respectively. Region between
    two dashed circular arcs indicates the tachocline.
-    4.6 Dynamo simulations with shallow meridional flow but with radial
    and latitudinal turbulent pumping included (same convention is
    followed as in Fig. 4.3). The toroidal (a) and poloidal field (b)
    plots show the dipolar nature of the solutions, and the butterfly
    diagram at the base of the convection zone clearly indicates the
    equatorward propagation of the toroidal field that forms sunspots.
-    4.7 Dynamo simulations considering both shallow meridional flow and
    turbulent pumping but started with symmetric initial condition. Plot
    of top pannel shows the correct phase relationship between toroidal
    and poloidal field while bottom pannel shows the butterfly diagram
    taken at the base of the convection zone.
-    4.8 Results of solar dynamo simulations with turbulent pumping and
    without any meridional circulation. The convention is the same as in
    Fig. 4.3. The simulations show that solar-like sunspot cycles can be
    generated even without any meridional plasma flow in the solar
    interior.
-    5.1 Top figure represents the geometry of Sweet-Parker reconnection
    model while bottom figure represents Petschek reconnection model. In
    case of Sweet-Parker reconnection model, diffusion region is a long
    thin sheet ( @xmath ) while for Petschek model, diffusion region is
    narrow ( @xmath ). As diffusion region is very narrow, inflow speed
    abruptly changes to outflow speed, thus Petschek considers slow mode
    shocks in outward flow region. Image credit: M J Aschwanden.

## Chapter 1 Introduction to the Solar Magnetic Cycle

### 1.1 The Sun: Interior and Atmosphere

#### 1.1.1 Solar Interior

The Sun is a completely gaseous body consisting mostly of hydrogen and
helium. Solar interior consists of three regions, namely, Core,
Radiative zone and Convection zone. Inside the core, energy is generated
via nuclear fusion by converting hydrogen into helium. When we go
outwards from the core to the surface, density decreases gradually.
Energy is transported via radiation in the inner 70 % of the Sun and by
convection in the outer 30 % of the Sun. In the interface between these
two regions, a strong radial shear in the rotation (known as the
tachocline) exists between 0.675 and 0.725 solar radius (Charbonneau et
al. 1999).

#### 1.1.2 Solar Atmosphere

The region above the solar photosphere is known as solar atmosphere. A
small region above the photosphere where temperature rises from 6000K to
20000K is known as the chromosphere. The very low density region above
the chromosphere where temperature is of the order of @xmath K is called
the solar corona. The solar corona is only visible at the time of total
solar eclipse. The layer which separates the chromosphere and the corona
is known as the transition region. The rapid rise in temperature from
the chromosphere to corona can not be of thermal origin as this would
violate the second law of thermodynamics. This problem is known as the
coronal heating problem. Different layers of the Sun (both interior and
atmosphere) are shown in Fig. 1.1.

### 1.2 Discovery of the Solar Magnetic Cycle

Sunspots are transient dark spots on the solar surface. Large number of
naked eye sunspot observations were reported by Chinese astronomers
around 27 BC. There are almost no records of sunspot observations in
Europe before 17th century. In 807 AD, a large sunspot was seen for more
than 8 days and it was simply interpreted as a planetary transit. The
invention of the telescope in the early seventeenth century brought
about a revolution in the field of astronomy. This invention made
possible the detailed observational study of sunspots and astronomers
like Galileo Galilei, Thomas Harriot, Johanes and David Fabricius, and
Christoph Scheiner were quick to harness the immense potential of the
telescope. In 1611, Johanes Fabricius was the first to publish a
description of sunspots in his book "De Maculis in Sole Observatis" (On
the spots observed in the Sun).

Very few sunspots were observed during the second part of seventeenth
century. Later it was revealed that this was not due to lack of
observations. Surprisingly for a long period of time there were almost
no sunspots on the solar surface. This period between 1645 to 1715 is
known as the Maunder minimum. Absence of aurorae and lack of a bright
solar corona during solar eclipses was also noted during this period.

After analyzing more than two decades of sunspot observations, Samuel
Schwabe (1844) discovered the cyclic rise and fall of sunspot numbers
with a periodicity of 11 years. This is now well known as the solar
cycle (see top panel of Fig. 1.3). Just after the discovery of the solar
cycle, in 1852 four astronomers pointed out that the period of changes
of geomagnetic activity at the Earth was identical with the periodicity
of the solar cycle which provided a significant clue about possible
Sun-Earth connections. Later, Carrington (1858) noted that sunspots
first appear at mid-latitudes and then appear at lower and lower
latitudes (closer to the equator) as the cycle progresses. In 1904,
Edward and Annie Maunder introduced a new way of visualizing this
characteristic by plotting sunspot emergence latitude with time
(popularly known as butterfly diagram, bottom panel of Fig. 1.3). Till
then there was no evidence about the interconnection between sunspots
and the magnetic field. The first evidence about this interconnection
came from George Hale (1908), who identified sunspots as strong magnetic
regions on the solar surface (by observing the Zeeman splitting of the
sunspot spectra). In 1919, Hale and his coworkers discovered most of the
properties of sunspot groups (also known as Active Regions, Fig. 1.2):

@xmath Sunspots frequently appear in pairs at the surface and the
relative orientation of the magnetic field of most active regions is
opposite across the equator.

@xmath The polarity of active regions change from one to another solar
cycle but remains same in a hemisphere for a given solar cycle.

@xmath The line joining the bipolar sunspot pairs are tilted with
respect to the east-west direction (leading spot along the direction of
rotation is closer to the equator than the following spot) and this tilt
angle increases with latitude. This is known as Joy’s law.

Harold Babcock and his son Horace Babcock (1955) developed the
magnetograph and used this magnetograph to study the distribution of
magnetic fields on the region outside of sunspots. A very weak field of
the order of 10 Gauss was found to be mostly concentrated in the
latitude above @xmath , (Babcock, 1959). This weak diffuse magnetic
field migrates poleward and changes the sign of the polar field every 11
years. Note that the polar field reverses its polarity when the sunspot
number is maximum. We also note that recent high resolution observations
find vertically oriented magnetic flux tubes with strong kilo-Gauss
magnetic field strength in the polar region (Tsuneta et al. 2008), which
might also contribute to the polar field.

There is also another type of photospheric magnetic field structure
known as small scale magnetic field. This mixed polarity small scale
magnetic field is very dynamic and does not vary much with the solar
cycle. Although the origin of this small scale magnetic field is
unknown, some recent studies suggest that a small scale dynamo near the
solar surface (local dynamo), may be the source for this small scale
magnetic field (Petrovay & Szakaly 1993; Cattaneo 1999; Danilovic et al.
2010; Lites 2011).

### 1.3 Generation of the Large Scale Solar Magnetic Field

#### 1.3.1 Magnetohydrodynamics

Matter inside the Sun exists in the ionized (plasma) state. To explain
the magnetic nature of the solar cycle, one has to understand the
behaviour of magnetic fields inside electrically conducting fluids –
which is the heart of the subject Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The
interaction of the plasma velocity field with the magnetic field can be
described through the magnetic induction equation:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the first term in the right hand side of the equation is the
source term and the second term is the diffusion term. Here we assume
the situation where the diffusivity ( @xmath ) does not vary with space.

One important input in the induction equation is the velocity ( @xmath
). To describe a MHD system self-consistently, we also require the
Navier-Stokes equation, which describes the evolution of the velocity
field.

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the fluid velocity, @xmath is the force due to pressure
gradient, @xmath is the Lorentz force term and @xmath is the viscous
stress tensor. The Lorentz force term is calculated using the solution
of induction equation ( @xmath ), which acts as a forcing term in the
Navier-Stokes equation.

Note that @xmath is a valid solution of the induction equation, so that
no magnetic field generation is possible if we start with zero magnetic
field. So there must be some mechanism through which initial seed
magnetic fields can be generated and amplified. As we are mainly
interested in the generation of large scale solar magnetic fields, it is
suffice to assume that we start with a pre-existing seed magnetic field.
Dynamo is a process which can amplify this seed magnetic field to
produce large scale magnetic fields by converting the kinetic energy of
plasma into magnetic energy. So, in order to explore the full dynamical
behaviour of the magnetized plasma, we have to solve equations (1.1),
(1.2) together with the mass continuity and energy conservation
equations:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the heat loss rate which consists of the terms due to
thermal conduction, ohmic heating etc. and @xmath represents the ratio
between specific heats. These equations along with @xmath and equation
of state, comprise the full set of MHD equations.

The evolution of magnetic field (equation 1.1) inside the plasma is
governed by the competition between induction and diffusion of the
magnetic field. If we take the ratio of two terms on the right hand side
of the equation then we get the magnetic Reynold’s number, @xmath where
@xmath is the velocity and @xmath is the spatial length-scale. Now it is
obvious that @xmath for astrophysical systems as length scales (L) are
very large. In this case one may approximate the induction equation as:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

In this situation (i.e., in the ideal MHD limit), Alfvén (1942a) pointed
out that magnetic flux is conserved inside the plasma system and moves
with the fluid. This theorem is known as Alfvén’s theorem of
flux-freezing. It is well known from early nineteenth century
observations that the Sun rotates differentially with the equator
rotating faster than the pole. Since the flux is frozen inside the
plasma, it allows differential rotation to stretch magnetic field lines
along the direction of rotation (i.e., the toroidal or @xmath
direction). This process is known as the @xmath -effect and was first
pointed out by Larmor (1919).

Theoretical and numerical magnetoconvection studies performed by
Chandrasekhar (1952) and Weiss (1981) suggest that in the presence of
magnetic field, convective systems get separated into regions that are
free of magnetic field where vigorous convection takes place while
magnetic fields are concentrated into thin structures in the form of
flux tubes. It is also known that the presence of strong magnetic field
makes the magneto-fluid more stable against convection, i.e., convection
is suppressed within regions of strong magnetic field due to the tension
of magnetic field lines (Thompson 1951; Chandrasekhar 1952). Since
convection is suppressed in regions of strong magnetic field, there is
less efficient heat transport in these regions. Because of this,
sunspots appear darker than the surroundings. To sum up, it is expected
that magnetic field exists in the form of flux tubes inside the solar
convection zone and strong differential rotation of the Sun stretches
these flux tubes in the toroidal i.e., @xmath -direction.

Let us assume that the gas pressure inside the flux tube is @xmath and
outside it is @xmath , @xmath is the strength of magnetic field inside
the flux tube. To maintain pressure balance across the surrounding
surface of the flux tube:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

When the flux tubes are in isothermal condition, the above equation
implies, @xmath . If such a situation arises in any part of the flux
tube, then this part will experience a buoyancy force. Due to magnetic
buoyancy this part rises up against gravity and generates bipolar
sunspot pairs on the solar surface (Parker 1955a, 1955b).

#### 1.3.2 Parker’s Mean-Field Dynamo

In spherical geometry, we can write the magnetic field as:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

We consider the stellar system as axisymmetric with the rotation axis
coinciding with the axis of symmetry. Then @xmath , @xmath and @xmath do
not vary with @xmath . In this situation, we can write the magnetic
field as a sum of the toroidal ( @xmath ) and poloidal ( @xmath ) field
components.

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath .

In this case, @xmath can be expressed in terms of the vector potential:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

To explain the origin of the solar cycle, Parker (1955b) first proposed
the idea of flux recycling between the toroidal and poloidal field
components.

The first part of the full dynamo mechanism ( @xmath ) relies on the
idea proposed by Larmor (1919). In this process shearing of the large
scale poloidal field due to strong differential rotation produces the
toroidal field.

The second part of the dynamo mechanism ( @xmath ) is a debated issue.
The first breakthrough in this direction was proposed by Parker (1955b).
The idea was that when some part of the toroidal flux tube rises through
the convection zone due to magnetic buoyancy, they are subject to
helical turbulence which imparts a twist to the rising plasma blobs. As
magnetic field is frozen inside the plasma, this helical twist of plasma
blobs also imparts a helical twist to the magnetic field. Thus rising
toroidal flux tubes are helically twisted out of the plane and produce
magnetic field component in the poloidal plane. Although the idea of
Parker at that time was largely intuitive, it was put on rigorous
mathematical footing after a decade through the development of mean
field electrodynamics (Steenbeck, Krause & Rädler 1966).

#### 1.3.3 Mean Field Electrodynamics

Turbulence is expected to play an important role in the solar dynamo as
the solar convective zone is highly turbulent. As it is not possible to
develop a deterministic theory to tackle turbulence, it is necessary to
develop a statistical scheme based on average properties of turbulence.

In a turbulent medium, we can decompose the fluid velocity ( @xmath )
and magnetic field ( @xmath ) in terms of mean and fluctuating parts.
Thus:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the term with overline corresponds to the mean and the primed
terms correspond to the fluctuating parts. In mean field theory the mean
typically denotes ensemble averages over length-scales and time-scales
much larger than turbulent eddy length-scale and eddy turn over time
scales. Also by definition, @xmath , i.e., mean of the fluctuating
components are zero. Substituting (1.10) into the magnetic induction
equation (1.1) we get:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where diffusivity ( @xmath ) is constant. Again averaging equation
(1.11) term by term, we get:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is known as the mean electromotive force which arises
because of the correlation between fluctuating components of velocity
and magnetic fields (Steenbeck, Krause & Rädler 1966; Krause & Rädler
1980). Subtracting (1.12) from (1.11), we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

Let us assume at initial time ( @xmath ), fluctuation in the magnetic
field is zero. From equation (1.13), it is clear that if there is no
fluctuation in the magnetic field ( @xmath ) then there is a linear
relationship between mean electromotive force ( @xmath ) and mean
magnetic field ( @xmath ). Now if we assume that the spatial scale of
the fluctuation is very small compared to the mean magnetic field
components, then we can express the mean emf in a Taylor series:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

Considering spatial derivatives upto the first order, we get:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the quantities @xmath and @xmath are pseudo tensors depending on
@xmath and @xmath . At this point, it is necessary to constrain @xmath
and @xmath , which is difficult because of our lack of knowledge about
convective turbulence.

We consider the simplest situation where the mean velocity field
vanishes i.e., @xmath and the turbulent velocity field ( @xmath ) is
steady, homogeneous and isotropic. In that case we can construct @xmath
and @xmath using only isotropic tensors. Thus we can write:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a pseudo scalar. Thus we get the expression for
turbulent emf as:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

Let us consider the turbulent medium as isotropic and inhomogeneous,
then we can express @xmath as a sum of symmetric and antisymmetric
components (as we are mainly interested in considering terms upto the
first order, we do not express @xmath as a sum of symmetric and
antisymmetric components).

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

So, @xmath ; Thus the expression for turbulent emf for isotropic
inhomogeneous medium becomes:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

where,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

We see from equation (1.20) that @xmath is proportional to the helical
motion in the turbulent medium, thus it represents the average helical
motion inside the turbulent convective zone. The term @xmath indicates
the correlation time for turbulence. The term @xmath has the same
dimension of diffusivity but its origin is turbulence, therefore this
term is known as turbulent diffusivity. The term @xmath represents the
advection of average field ( @xmath ) with an effective pumping velocity
@xmath . Since the term ( @xmath ) creates inhomogeneity in a
homogeneous medium this term is known as turbulent pumping. Given that
all physical quantities like pressure, temperature etc. inside the solar
convection zone are strongly dependent on the radial coordinate, one can
treat solar convection as anisotropic and inhomogeneous in the radial
coordinate only. Due to this highly stratified nature of convection,
there is an asymmetry between upward and downward flows (Hurlburt,
Toomre & Massaguer 1984). This asymmetry between upward and downward
flow causes turbulent pumping. Similarly, gradient in density produces
density pumping, topological asymmetry produces topological pumping.

Let us substitute equation (1.17) in equation (1.12), then we get:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath , is the net magnetic diffusivity. Equation (1.22)
represents the evolution of magnetic field in a homogeneous, isotropic
turbulent medium. The first term in the right hand side (RHS) of the
equation represents the advection of the magnetic field and the toroidal
field generation process due to shearing, the second term represents the
poloidal field generation process due to helical motions present in the
turbulent medium and the last term in the RHS represents turbulent
diffusion.

#### 1.3.4 Flux Tube Dynamics and the Babcock-Leighton Mechanism for
Poloidal Field Generation

Can the toroidal field generation take place throughout the full
convection zone of the Sun? It was soon understood that the toroidal
field generation due to shearing of the poloidal field is not possible
throughout the full convection zone because of the destabilizing effect
of magnetic buoyancy (Parker 1975; Moreno-Insertis 1983). Subsequently,
dynamo theorists favored the thin overshoot layer at the base of the
convection zone as the ideal place for amplification and storage of the
magnetic field (Spiegel & Weiss 1980; van Ballegooijen 1982; DeLuca &
Gilman 1986; Choudhuri 1990). After the helioseismic discovery of the
tachocline with a strong radial gradient in rotation at the base of the
convection zone, it is thought that the toroidal field generation and
storage takes place in that layer.

Numerical simulations of buoyant flux tubes suggest that only flux tubes
with initial field strength 50-100 KGauss are consistent with the
observed tilt and emergence latitude of active regions (Choudhuri &
Gilman 1987; D’Silva & Choudhuri 1993; Fan, Fisher & DeLuca 1993; Fan,
Fisher & McClymont 1994; Caligari, Moreno-Insertis & Schüssler 1995; Fan
& Fisher 1996; Caligari, Schüssler & Moreno-Insertis 1998; Fan & Gong
2000); also see D’Silva (1993). Flux tube simulations thus constrain the
value of toroidal field at the base of the convection zone. This value
is one order of magnitude higher than the equipartition field strength.
At this strong field strength, helical turbulence would not be able to
impart significant twist as required by the classical mean-field @xmath
-effect suggested by Parker (1955).

This realization has resulted in adoption of an alternative idea for
poloidal field generation. Babcock(1961) and Leighton (1969) proposed
that poloidal field can be regenerated at the surface due to the decay
and re-distribution of bipolar sunspot flux. This process is known as
the Babcock-Leighton mechanism. It is also a well known observational
fact that sunspots always appear in pairs at the surface with a
systematic tilt with respect to the east-west direction. Because of this
tilt angle, when sunspots decay, the flux from leading polarity
preferentially diffuses towards equator whereas flux from trailing
polarity is advected towards the poles (Fig. 1.5 a,b). As the polarity
orientation is opposite in each hemisphere there is a net cancellation
of flux across the equator and in the polar region accumulation of the
new flux cancels the opposite polarity flux of the previous cycle and
creates the new cycle polar field. Observationally it was found that the
mean tilt angle of bipolar sunspot regions vary from cycle to cycle and
there is a large scatter in the tilt angles (Dasi-Espuig et al. 2010).
Since Poloidal field generation in this mechanism is strongly dependent
on the tilt angle of the bipolar sunspot pairs, this mechanism itself is
a source of irregularity (Choudhuri et al. 2007; Jiang et al. 2007).
Recent observational results also lend strong support to this mechanism
(Dasi-Espuig et al. 2010; Kitchatinov & Olemskoy 2011a; Muñoz-Jaramillo
et al. 2013). In recent years most of the kinematic dynamo models are
based on the scenario that – a) The toroidal field is produced due to
strong differential rotation in the convection zone b) The poloidal
field is produced near the solar surface due to decay of bipolar sunspot
regions.

#### 1.3.5 Differential Rotation and Meridional Circulation: Essential
Ingredients of Solar Dynamo Modelling

In his classic paper, Parker (1955) showed that linear dynamo equations
support periodically propagating dynamo wave solutions – which signifies
the solar cycle. The direction of such periodic propagating dynamo waves
is given by:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the solar differential rotation which arises mainly
because of Reynolds stresses @xmath and @xmath (which creates angular
momentum flux). To obtain the equatorward propagation of dynamo waves
(in keeping with the equatorward migration of the sunspot belt), the
following condition must be satisfied:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is known as the Parker-Yoshimura sign rule (Parker 1955; Yoshimura
1975). Since at that time the profile of the differential rotation
inside the convection zone was unknown, there was full freedom to choose
the profile of differential rotation such that results match with
observation. When the differential rotation was measured by
helioseismology with great accuracy (Thompson et al. 1996; Kosovichev et
al. 1997; Schou et al. 1998) it was found that the observed differential
rotation profile would give rise to poleward propagating dynamo
solutions as there is a negative radial shear at low latitudes. At this
point it was necessary to address this problem.

Observations of small magnetic features on the solar surface show that
they are carried by surface flows from equator to pole with an estimated
speed of 10-20 m/s (Komm, Howard & Harvey 1993; Latushko 1994; Snodgrass
& Dailey 1996; Hathaway 1996). This axisymmetric poleward flow in the
meridional plane is known as meridional circulation. Helioseismic
measurements in later time also confirmed these observations and
measured these poleward flows more accurately at the top 10 % of the
solar convection zone (Giles et al. 1997; Schou & Bogart 1998; Braun &
Fan 1998, González Hernández et al. 1999). Although measurement of the
meridional circulation deep in the convection zone is still not
possible, it is reasonable to assume that there must be an equatorward
return flow somewhere in the convection zone because of mass
conservation. The latitudinal structure of the surface meridional flow
is well observed (Hathaway & Rightmire 2010,2011; Hathaway 1996) but the
radial structure still remains largely controversial (Zhao et al. 2013).
If these two largely segregated source layers ( @xmath -effect is at the
surface while @xmath -effect is at the base of the convection zone) are
only coupled by diffusion (no meridional circulation is present), then
there is poleward propagation of the sunspot belt according to the
Parker-Yoshimura sign rule. However if these two layers are coupled by
meridional circulation then we can get equatorward propagation of
sunspot belts even if the Parker-Yoshimura sign rule is violated
(Choudhuri et al. 1995; Durney 1995). After this insight meridional
circulation became an essential ingredient in solar dynamo models.

#### 1.3.6 Kinematic Babcock-Leighton Dynamo Models

In the kinematic dynamo problem, plasma flows are taken as inputs and it
is assumed that the mean flows are not significantly altered by the
Lorentz force. Observationally it is found that mean flows do not vary
significantly with time thus the kinematic approach may be a good
approximation to study the evolution of solar magnetic fields. In the
axisymmetric spherical coordinate system, we can represent the magnetic
and velocity fields as:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath represents the toroidal magnetic field and
vector potential for the poloidal magnetic field, @xmath is the
differential rotation and @xmath is the meridional flow.

Substituting these into the magnetic induction equation, we get the
standard @xmath -dynamo equations:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . The terms with @xmath in left hand side of both the
equations correspond to the advection and deformation of magnetic field
by meridional circulation. In the right hand side of both the equations,
first term corresponds to the diffusion of magnetic field and second
term corresponds to the source term. On the RHS of equation (1.27), the
third term corresponds to the advection of magnetic field due to the
gradient of turbulent diffusivity. In equation (1.26), @xmath represents
the generation of poloidal field due to the Babcock-Leighton mechanism.
For the research work described in this thesis, we model the
Babcock-Leighton mechanism i.e., the source term for poloidal field
evolution equation by the methods of double ring proposed by Durney
(1997) and subsequently used by Nandy & Choudhuri (2001),
Muñoz-Jaramillo, Nandy, Martens & Yeates (2010) and Nandy,
Muñoz-Jaramillo & Martens (2011). In equation (1.26) and (1.27), we have
to define three input ingredients so that we can solve these system of
equations: magnetic diffusivity, differential rotation and meridional
circulation.

Now we discuss these three essential input ingredients in kinematic
solar dynamo models, namely, turbulent diffusivity, differential
rotation and meridional circulation. With the turbulent diffusivity term
we try to capture the net effect of convective turbulence on the large
scale magnetic field. This term also acts as a communicator between two
source layers (as two source layers are segregated; the poloidal field
generation takes place at the solar surface while the toroidal field
generation takes place at the base of the convection zone). Here we use
double step diffusivity profile (Dikpati et al. 2002; Chatterjee, Nandy
& Choudhuri 2004; Guerrero & de Gouveia Dal Pino 2007; Jouve & Brun
2007, Muñoz-Jaramillo, Nandy & Martens 2009):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (1.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath cm @xmath /s, @xmath cm @xmath /s and @xmath cm @xmath /s
corresponds to the diffusivity at the bottom of computational domain,
diffusivity in the convection zone and near surface supergranular
diffusivity respectively. Transition from one value of diffusivity to
another is characterized by @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . The
typical double step magnetic diffusivity profile is shown in Fig. 1.6
(a). See Muñoz-Jaramillo et al. (2011) for a discussion on constraining
the diffusivity profile.

One necessary input parameter in solar dynamo models is the differential
rotation ( @xmath ; which stretches poloidal field lines in the @xmath
-direction and creates the toroidal field). Here we use the differential
rotation profile as prescribed by Muñoz-Jaramillo et al. (2009) (see
Fig. 1.6 (b)):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath i.e. the location of the tachocline, @xmath i.e. half of
thickness of the tachocline, @xmath nHz i.e. rotation frequency of the
core, @xmath nHz i.e. rotation frequency of the equator, @xmath nHz i.e.
rotation frequency of the pole and @xmath .

The meridional circulation (i.e., velocity component in the @xmath
plane) can be defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is estimated from the stream function (defined within @xmath ,
i.e., in the northern hemisphere) as described in Chatterjee, Nandy and
Choudhuri (2004):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (1.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the parameters are defined as follow: @xmath . The term @xmath
determines the the maximum speed of the flow. @xmath is the penetration
depth of the meridional flow. The meridional circulation profile in the
southern hemisphere is generated by a mirror reflection of the velocity
profile across the equator. Streamlines of a typical meridional
circulation profile are shown in Fig. 1.7 (a).

Taking the density stratification in the convection zone as @xmath (from
standard solar model; Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. 1996), we get the
speed of meridional circulation:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

where, @xmath , @xmath .

Some studies find the peak speed of the flow is in the range of 12-20
m/s (Komm, Howard & Harvey 1993; Braun & Fan 1998; Gizon & Rempel 2008).
Here we set the peak speed of the meridional circulation at mid
latitudes to be 18 m/s. Fig. 1.7 (b) shows the variation of the @xmath
component of this velocity at mid latitude as a function of solar
radius. Fig. 1.8 shows the variation of the @xmath component of this
velocity as a function of latitude at the solar surface.

Having defined all the input ingredients we can solve equations (1.26)
and (1.27) with appropriate boundary conditions. We perform all of our
spatially extended dynamo simulations in a meridional slab @xmath and
within @xmath . Since we use axisymmetric equations, both the poloidal
and toroidal field vectors need to be zero ( @xmath and @xmath ) at the
pole ( @xmath and @xmath ), to avoid any singularity. At the bottom of
the computational domain i.e., at @xmath , we assume perfectly
conducting material, thus both field components vanish ( @xmath and
@xmath ) at the bottom boundary. At the top ( @xmath ), we assume that
there is only radial component of magnetic field ( @xmath and @xmath );
this is necessary for stress balance between subsurface and coronal
magnetic fields (van Ballegooijen & Mackay 2007). We set @xmath and
@xmath as initial conditions for our 2.5D dynamo simulation.

Fig. 1.9 shows a simulation from our solar dynamo model. From this plot,
we find that our dynamo model is able to represent some of the important
features of the solar cycle, e.g., periodicity, phase relationship and
relative hemispheric orientation of both the toroidal and poloidal
field, sunspot eruption latitudes, equatorward migration of sunspot
belts and the pole-ward migration of the radial field.

We also point out that our model results are robust w.r.t. the assumed
profile of internal meridional flow. We demonstrate this by utilizing a
different meridional flow profile as suggested by Muñoz-Jaramillo et al.
(2009) based on fits to the helioseismic data, wherein the stream
function and profile is given by:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

where, q=1 governs the latitudinal dependence, @xmath is the penetration
depth, a=1.92 and @xmath govern the location of the peak of poleward
flow and the amplitude and location of equatorward return flow. @xmath
is used to control the amplitude of meridional flow. We find that the
results do not change qualitatively with the alternative meridional flow
profile (see Fig. 1.10).

In the next few chapters of this thesis, we will investigate some
important features of the solar cycle using this model.

## Chapter 2 Exploring Grand Minima Phases with a Low Order, Time Delay
Dynamo Model

Fluctuations in the Sun’s magnetic activity, including episodes of grand
minima such as the Maunder minimum have important consequences for space
and planetary environments. However, the underlying dynamics of such
extreme fluctuations remain ill-understood. In this chapter we develop a
low order time delay dynamo model removing all space dependent terms.
Introduction of time delays capture the physics of magnetic flux
transport between spatially segregated dynamo source regions in the
solar interior. We follow the Babcock-Leighton approach to treat the
poloidal field generation mechanism due to decay and dispersal of tilted
bipolar sunspot region. Introducing stochastic fluctuation in
Babcock-Leighton source term for poloidal field generation, we
demonstrate that the Babcock-Leighton poloidal field source based on
dispersal of tilted bipolar sunspot flux, alone, can not recover the
sunspot cycle from a grand minimum. We find that an additional poloidal
field source effective on weak fields – e.g., the mean-field @xmath
-effect driven by helical turbulence – is necessary for self-consistent
recovery of the sunspot cycle from grand minima episodes.

### 2.1 Introduction

Sunspots, which are strongly magnetized regions, play a key role in
governing the activity of the Sun. The number of sunspots observed on
the solar surface waxes and wanes with time generating the 11-year solar
cycle. While there is a small variation in this periodicity,
fluctuations in the amplitude of the solar cycle are large. Extreme
fluctuations are manifest in grand maxima episodes – when the cycle
amplitudes are much higher than normal, and grand minima episodes – when
the cycle amplitudes fall drastically, even leading to the disappearance
of sunspots for an extended period of time. The most striking evidence
of such a minimum in the recorded history of sunspot numbers is the
so-called Maunder minimum between 1645 and 1715 AD (Eddy 1988). The lack
of sunspots during this period is statistically well-proven and is not
due to the lack of observations – which covered 68% of the days during
this period (Hoyt & Schatten 1996). The occurrence of these solar
activity extremes is correlated with temperature records over millennium
scale (Usoskin et al. 2005); the solar Maunder minimum coincided with
the severest part of the Little Ice Age – a period of global cooling on
Earth.

Over the last decade, solar activity reconstructions based on cosmogenic
isotopes and geomagnetic data (Usoskin et al. 2000, 2003, 2007; Miyahara
et al. 2004; Steinhilber et al. 2010; Lockwood & Owens 2011), which are
indirect proxies for probing long-term solar activity have brought to
the fore various properties of these grand minima episodes. These
observations show that there have been many such activity minima in the
past; however the solar cycle has recovered every time and regained
normal activity levels. There is some evidence for persistent, but very
weak amplitude cycles during the Maunder minimum and a slow
strengthening of cycle amplitudes to normal levels during the recovery
phase. While the general perception was that the onset of the Maunder
minimum was sudden, a recent reconstruction based on historical sunspot
records has challenged that notion indicating that the onset phase of
the minimum may have been gradual (Vaquero et al. 2011).

A magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) dynamo mechanism, involving interactions of
plasma flows and magnetic fields drives the solar cycle. Our
understanding of the solar dynamo, see e.g., the reviews by Ossendrijver
(Ossendrijver 2003) and Charbonneau (Charbonneau 2010), is based on the
generation and recycling of the toroidal and poloidal components of the
Sun’s magnetic field. The toroidal magnetic field is produced by
stretching of poloidal field lines by differential rotation – a process
termed as the @xmath -effect (Parker 1955). It is thought this process
is concentrated near the base of the solar convection zone (SCZ) – where
the upper part of the tachocline (a region of strong radial gradient in
the rotation) and overshoot layer (which is stable to convection) offers
an ideal location for toroidal field amplification and storage.
Sufficiently strong toroidal flux tubes are magnetically buoyant and
erupt radially outwards producing sunspots where they intersect the
solar surface.

For the dynamo to function, the poloidal component has to be regenerated
back from the toroidal component, a step for which, diverse propositions
exist. The first such proposition invoked helical turbulent convection
as a means of twisting rising toroidal flux tubes to regenerate the
poloidal component (a mechanism traditionally known as the the mean
field @xmath -effect; Parker 1955). Numerous dynamo models based on the
mean-field @xmath -effect were constructed and such models enjoyed a
long run as the leading contender for explaining the origin of the solar
cycle (Charbonneau 2010). However, subsequent simulations of the
dynamics of buoyant toroidal flux tubes and observational constraints
set by the tilt angle distribution of sunspots pointed out that the
toroidal magnetic field at the base of the SCZ must be as high as @xmath
G (D’Silva & Choudhuri 1993; Fan et al. 1993; Caligari et al. 1995);
such strong toroidal flux tubes being one order of magnitude stronger
than the equipartition magnetic field in the SCZ would render the mean
field @xmath -effect ineffective. This consideration revived interest in
an alternative mechanism of poloidal field production based on the flux
transport mediated decay and dispersal of tilted bipolar sunspots pairs
in the near-surface layers (Babcock 1961; Leighton 1969), hereby,
referred to as the Babcock-Leighton mechanism.

In the last couple of decades, multiple dynamo models have been based on
this idea (Durney 1997; Dikpati & Charbonneau 1999; Nandy & Choudhuri
2002; Chatterjee et al. 2004; Muñoz-Jaramillo et al. 2009) and have
successfully reproduced many nuances of the solar cycle. Some (Tobias et
al. 2006; Bushby & Tobias 2007; Cattaneo & Hughes 2009) have criticised
the usage of such mean-field dynamo models to predict the solar cycle,
however it should be noted that recent studies (Simard et al. 2013; Dube
& Charbonneau 2013) indicate that if input profiles are extracted from
three-dimensional full MHD simulations and fed into two-dimensional
mean-field dynamo models, they are capable of producing qualitatively
similar solutions to those found in the full MHD simulations. The major
advantage of the mean-field dynamo framework is that it allows for much
faster integration times compared to the full MHD simulations and are
therefore computationally efficient as well as physically transparent.
Recent observations also lend strong support to the Babcock-Leighton
mechanism (Dasi-Espuig et al. 2010; Muñoz-Jaramillo et al. 2013) and
this is now believed to be the dominant source for the Sun’s poloidal
field. Surface transport models (Wang et al. 1989; van Ballegooijen et
al. 2010) also provide theoretical evidence that this mechanism is in
fact operating in the solar surface. Randomness or stochastic
fluctuations in the Babcock-Leighton poloidal field generation mechanism
is an established method for exploring variability in solar cycle
amplitudes (Charbonneau & Dikpati 2000; Charbonneau et al. 2004, 2005;
Passos & Lopes 2011; Passos et al. 2012, Choudhuri & Karak 2012) as are
deterministic or non-linear feedback mechanisms (Wilmot-Smith et al.
2005; Jouve et al. 2010). Stochastic fluctuations within the dynamo
framework are physically motivated from the random buffeting that a
rising magnetic flux tube endures during its ascent through the
turbulent convection zone and from the observed scatter around the mean
(Joy’s law) distribution of tilt angles. It is to be noted that similar
fluctuations are to be expected in the mean-field @xmath effect as well
(Hoyng 1988) and such phenomenon can be explored within the framework of
truncated mean-field dynamo models (Yoshimura 1975).

Since the two source layers for toroidal field generation (the @xmath
effect) and poloidal field regeneration (the @xmath -effect) are
spatially segregated in the SCZ, there must be effective communication
to complete the dynamo loop. Magnetic buoyancy efficiently transports
toroidal field from the bottom of the convection zone to the solar
surface. On the other hand, meridional circulation, turbulent diffusion
and turbulent pumping share the role of transporting the poloidal flux
from the surface back to the solar interior (Karak & Nandy 2012) where
the toroidal field of the next cycle is generated thus keeping the
cycles going. Thus, there is a time delay built into the system due to
the finite time required for transporting magnetic fluxes from one
source region to another within the SCZ.

Based on delay differential equations and the introduction of randomness
on the poloidal field source, here we construct a novel, stochastically
forced, non-linear time delay dynamo model for the solar cycle to
explore long-term solar activity variations. We particularly focus our
investigations on the recovery from grand minima phases and demonstrate
that the Babcock-Leighton mechanism alone – which is believed to be the
dominant source for the poloidal field – cannot restart the solar cycle
once it settles into a prolonged grand minimum. The presence of an
additional poloidal field source capable of working on weak magnetic
fields, such as the mean field @xmath -effect is necessary for
recovering the solar cycle.

### 2.2 Stochastically Forced, Non-Linear, Time Delay Solar Dynamo Model

The model is an extension of the low order time delay dynamo equations
previously explored by Wilmot-Smith et al. (2006). This model was
derived considering only the source and dissipative mechanisms in the
dynamo process. All space dependent terms were removed and instead the
physical effect of flux transport through space was captured through the
explicit introduction of time delays in the system of equations.

The time delay dynamo equations are given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.1)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath represents toroidal field strength and @xmath represents
poloidal field strength. The evolution of each magnetic component is due
to the interplay of the source and dissipative terms in the system. In
the toroidal field evolution equation @xmath is the difference in
rotation rate over the depth of the SCZ and @xmath is the depth of SCZ.
Thus @xmath corresponds to the average shear in the differential
rotation. The dissipative term is governed by turbulent diffusion,
characterized by the diffusion time scale ( @xmath ). The parameter
@xmath is the time delay for the conversion of poloidal field into
toroidal field and is justified by the finite time that the meridional
circulation or turbulent pumping takes to transport the poloidal
magnetic flux from the surface layers to the tachocline. @xmath is the
time delay for the conversion of toroidal field into poloidal field and
accounts for the buoyant rise time of toroidal flux tubes through the
SCZ.

The meridional circulation timescale is about 10 yr for a peak flow
speed 20 m @xmath (from mid-latitudes at near-surface layers to
mid-latitudes above the convection zone base; see Yeates et al. 2008 for
detailed calculation of meridional circulation time scale). Another
dominant flux transport mechanism for downward transport of magnetic
field could be turbulent flux pumping with a timescale of about one yr
(with a relatively high pumping speed of 5 m @xmath ). The buoyant rise
time of flux tubes from the SCZ base to surface is about three months
(assuming the rise timescale is of the order of Alfvénic time scale,
which is also a general agreement with simulations; see also Fan et al.
1993). As the magnetic buoyancy time scale is much shorter compared to
the meridional circulation (or turbulent diffusion or flux pumping)
timescale, we assume @xmath . Since it is not clear which is the most
dominant flux transport mechanism - meridional circulation or turbulent
pumping, we explore our model in two different regimes of operation to
test for robustness. In one setup, we consider @xmath (if @xmath
corresponds to pumping time scale) and @xmath (if @xmath corresponds to
meridional circulation time scale). This model setup mimics spatial
separation between two source layers in the Sun’s convection zone and
the role of magnetic flux transport between them and is therefore
physically motivated. On the other hand, due to its nature, this model
is amenable to long time-integration without being computationally
expensive.

To account for quenching of the Babcock-Leighton poloidal source @xmath
, we take a general form of @xmath , i.e @xmath , where @xmath is the
amplitude of the @xmath effect and @xmath is the quenching factor
approximated here by a nonlinear function

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

Figure 2.1 depicts this quenching function, constructed with the
motivation that only flux tubes with field strength above @xmath (and
not below) can buoyantly rise up to the solar surface and contribute to
the Babcock-Leighton poloidal field source, i.e., sunspots (Parker 1955)
and that flux tubes stronger than @xmath erupt without any tilt
therefore quenching the poloidal source (D’Silva & Choudhuri 1993; Fan
et al. 1993). Accounting for these lower and upper operating thresholds
for the Babcock-Leighton poloidal source is fundamentally important for
the dynamics.

Our aim here is to explore the impact of stochastic fluctuations in this
time delay solar dynamo model. For @xmath , we get a strictly periodic
solution. In order to introduce stochastic fluctuations, we redefine
@xmath as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a uniform random function lying in the range [+1,-1],
changing values at a coherence time, @xmath . Statistical fluctuations
are characterized by @xmath and @xmath , which correspond to percentile
level of fluctuation and coherence time correspondingly. Figure 2.2
shows a typical @xmath fluctuation generated by our random number
generation program. Stochastic variations in the Babcock-Leighton @xmath
coefficient are natural because they arise from the cumulative effect of
a finite number of discrete flux emergences, i.e., active region
eruptions, all with various degrees of tilt randomly scattered around a
mean Joy’s law distribution.

In this system the dynamo number ( @xmath ) is defined as the ratio
between the source and dissipative terms, which is a measure of the
efficiency of the dynamo mechanism. The product of source terms is
@xmath while that of the dissipative terms is @xmath . In terms of
physical parameters, the expected diffusion time scale ( @xmath ) in the
SCZ is 13.8 yr for a typical diffusivity of @xmath implying that the
dissipative term ( @xmath ) is of the order of @xmath . Now, if we take
the value of @xmath as the difference in rotation rate across the SCZ in
nHz (as measured; for details see Howe 2009) , L as the length of SCZ
and @xmath as 1 m @xmath then the source term @xmath , is of the same
order as the dissipative term and the dynamo number can be made higher
than unity by slightly adjusting the @xmath coefficient. In fact, if the
tachocline is considered as the interface across which flux transport is
occurring, then the dynamo number becomes even greater as the radial
differential rotation is about the same while the length scale reduces
further. In this model we always take the value of @xmath (source term)
to be greater than @xmath (decay term), and set the magnitude of @xmath
and @xmath in a way such that the strength of toroidal field is greater
than the strength of poloidal field (as suggested by observations). In
summary, keeping all of the other physically motivated parameters fixed,
the dynamo number can be varied by adjusting the value of @xmath . Since
@xmath corresponds to the equipartition field strength (on the order of
@xmath Gauss) above which magnetic flux tubes become buoyant while
@xmath is on the order of @xmath Gauss (above which flux tubes emerge
without any tilt, thus shutting off the Babcock-Leighton source; D’Silva
& Choudhuri 1993), we take the ratio of @xmath as 7 for all of our
calculation. Here we explore our low order time delay model in two
parameter space regimes to test for robustness. In the first case we fix
the parameters as @xmath and @xmath while in the second case we take
@xmath and @xmath . Initial conditions are taken to be @xmath for both A
and @xmath . Our choice of parameters ensures that in both cases the
diffusive timescale is much higher than flux transport timescales (
@xmath ). The simulations are robust over a range of negative @xmath
values; for a detailed parameter space study of the underlying model
without stochastic fluctuations, please refer to Wilmot-Smith et al.
(2006). Below, we present the results of our stochastically forced
dynamo simulations focusing on entry and exit from grand minima
episodes.

### 2.3 Results and Discussions

We first perform simulations without the lower operating threshold in
the Babcock-Leighton @xmath -effect (setting @xmath ) in Eqn. 2.3. A
majority of Babcock-Leighton dynamo models, including many that have
explored the dynamics of grand minima do not use this lower operating
threshold. As already known (Charbonneau & Dikpati 2000; Choudhuri &
Karak 2012) we find that the Babcock-Leighton dynamo with this setup
generate cycles of varying amplitudes, including episodes of higher than
average activity levels (grand maxima) and occasional episodes of very
low amplitude cycles reminiscent of Maunder-like grand minima (Fig. 2.3,
upper panel; Fig. 2.4, upper panel). When we do switch on the lower
operating threshold, however, we find that the Babcock-Leighton dynamo
is unable to recover once it settles into a grand minimum

(Fig. 2.3, lower panel; Fig. 2.4, lower panel). This striking result can
be explained invoking the underlying physics of the solar cycle. When a
series of poloidal field fluctuations lead to a decline in the toroidal
field amplitude below the threshold necessary for magnetic buoyancy to
operate (with a consequent failure of sunspots to form), the
Babcock-Leighton poloidal field source which relies on bipolar sunspot
eruptions completely switches off resulting in a catastrophic quenching
of the solar cycle. Earlier simulations, which did not include the lower
quenching missed out on this physics because even very weak magnetic
fields, which in reality could never have produced sunspots, continued
to (unphysically) contribute to poloidal field creation. Earlier, it has
been shown that the lower threshold due to magnetic buoyancy plays a
crucial amplitude limiting role in the Babcock-Leighton solar cycle
(Nandy 2002) and this study indicates that this should be accounted for
in all Babcock-Leighton solar dynamo models.

To circumvent this problem faced by the stochastically forced
Babcock-Leighton dynamo, we explicitly test an idea (Nandy 2012) for the
recovery of the solar cycle based on an additional poloidal source
effective on weak toroidal fields. Since the tachocline is the seat of
strong toroidal field, any weak field @xmath which is effective only on
sub-equipartition strength field will get quenched there. Thus, this
@xmath -effect must reside above the base of the SCZ (Parker 1993) in a
layer away from the strongest toroidal fields. Motivated by this, we
devise a new system of dynamo equations governed by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.5)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , the quenching function for the weak field poloidal source
@xmath is shown in Fig. 2.1 and is parameterized by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

Taking @xmath ensures that the weak field source term gets quenched at
or below the lower operating threshold for the Babcock-Leighton @xmath
and the former, therefore, can be interpreted to be the mean field
@xmath effect. In equation 2.6, the time delay @xmath is the time
necessary for the toroidal field to enter the source region where the
additional, weak-field @xmath effect is located.

If @xmath , i.e. the generation layer of the additional @xmath effect is
coincident with the @xmath effect (layer) then we find that the
stochastically forced dynamo again fails to recover from a grand
minimum. This is reminiscent of the original motivation behind the
introduction of the interface dynamo idea with spatially segregated
source regions (Parker 1993). However, if @xmath is finite and @xmath
(i.e., there is some segregation between the @xmath effect toroidal
source, the additional weak-field @xmath and the Babcock-Leighton @xmath
), we find that the solar cycle can recover from grand minima like
episodes in a robust manner. Figures 2.5 and 2.6 depict such solutions
(for two different sets of parameter), where we explicitly demonstrate
self-consistent entry and exit from grand minima like episodes. We note
that this recovery of the solar cycle from grand minima like episodes is
possible with or without fluctuations in the additional, weak field
poloidal source term @xmath .

### 2.4 Conclusions

In summary, we have constructed a new model of the solar dynamo for
exploring solar cycle fluctuations based on a system of stochastically
forced, non-linear, delay differential equations. Utilizing this model
for long-term simulations we have explicitly demonstrated that the
currently favored mechanism for solar poloidal field production, the
Babcock-Leighton mechanism, alone, cannot recover the solar cycle from a
grand minimum. We have also demonstrated that an additional, mean field
like @xmath -effect capable of working on weaker fields is necessary for
self-consistent entry and exit of the solar cycle from grand minima
episodes. We have demonstrated that our results and conclusions hold
over two very diverse regimes of parameter choices. Although we have
utilized fluctuations in the poloidal source in our study, we do not
claim that this is the only possible source of fluctuations in the solar
cycle. We also point out that our model results are robust if we run
simulations considering fluctuations in time delay (Fig. 2.7). We note
that simulations motivated from this current study and based on a
spatially extended dynamo model in a solar-like geometry supports the
results from this mathematical time delay model (Passos et al. 2014).
Taken together, these strengthen the conclusion that a mean field like
@xmath -effect effective on weak toroidal fields must be functional in
the Sun’s convection zone and that this is vitally important for the
solar cycle, even if the dominant contribution to the poloidal field
comes from the Babcock-Leighton mechanism during normal activity phases.

## Chapter 3 Strong Hemispheric Asymmetry can Trigger Parity Changes in
the Sunspot Cycle

Although sunspots have been systematically observed on the Sun’s surface
over the last four centuries, their magnetic properties have been
revealed and documented only since the early 1900s. Sunspots typically
appear in pairs of opposite magnetic polarity which have a systematic
orientation. This polarity orientation is opposite across the equator –
a trend that has persisted over the last century since observations of
sunspot magnetic fields exist. Taken together with the configuration of
the global poloidal field of the Sun – that governs the heliospheric
open flux and cosmic ray flux at Earth – this phenomena is consistent
with the dipolar parity state of an underlying magnetohydrodynamic
dynamo mechanism. Although, hemispheric asymmetry in the emergence of
sunspots is observed in the Sun, a parity shift has never been observed.
We simulate hemispheric asymmetry through introduction of random
fluctuations in a computational dynamo model of the solar cycle and
demonstrate that changes in parity are indeed possible over long
time-scales. In particular, we find that a parity shift in the
underlying nature of the sunspot cycle is more likely to occur when
sunspot activity dominates in any one hemisphere for a time which is
significantly longer compared to the sunspot cycle period. Our
simulations suggest that the sunspot cycle may have resided in
quadrupolar parity states in the distant past, and provides a possible
pathway for predicting parity flips in the future.

### 3.1 Introduction

Samuel Heinrich Schwabe discovered the 11 year solar cycle in 1843, but
detailed observations about the dipolar nature of solar magnetic fields
exist only for last hundred years (Hale et al. 1919). One may pose the
question whether solar magnetic fields have always been in the dipolar
state?

To investigate this issue we use an axisymmetric kinematic flux
transport solar dynamo model which involves the generation and recycling
of the toroidal and poloidal field (Parker 1955). In this model, the
toroidal field is produced by stretching of poloidal field lines at the
base of the convection zone due to strong differential rotation (Parker
1955) and the poloidal field is generated through a combination of mean
field @xmath -effect due to helical turbulence in the solar convection
zone (Parker 1955) and the Babcock-Leighton mechanism due to decay and
dispersal of tilted bipolar sunspot region at the near-surface layers
(Babcock 1961; Leighton 1969). The kinematic flux transport dynamo model
based on the Babcock-Leighton mechanism for poloidal field generation
has been successful in explaining different observational aspects of the
solar cycle (Dikpati & Charbonneau 1999; Nandy & Choudhuri 2002;
Chatterjee et al. 2004; Goel & Choudhuri 2009; Nandy et al. 2011; Karak
& Nandy 2012; DeRosa et al. 2012). Recent observations also lend strong
support to the Babcock-Leighton mechanism as a primary source for
poloidal field generation (Dasi-Espuig et al. 2010; Muñoz-Jaramillo et
al. 2013).

It is widely thought that stochastic fluctuations in the poloidal field
generation mechanism is the primary source for irregularity in the solar
cycle (Hoyng 1988; Choudhuri 1992; Charbonneau & Dikpati 2000;
Charbonneau et al. 2004). In the Babcock-Leighton framework, poloidal
field generation depends on the tilt angle of bipolar sunspot pairs,
which is imparted by the action of Coriolis force on buoyantly rising
toroidal flux tubes from the base of the solar convection zone.
Observational scatter of tilt angles around the mean given by Joy’s law
may be produced by turbulent buffeting that a rising flux tube
encounters during its journey through the convection zone (Longcope &
Choudhuri 2002). Thus the Babcock-Leighton mechanism for poloidal field
generation is not a deterministic process but a random one (Choudhuri et
al. 2007). Another major source in solar cycle irregularity is
fluctuations in the meridional circulation (Lopes & Passos 2009; Karak
2010).

On the one hand, two different types of symmetries are obtained, in
general, in solutions of the dynamo equations. The global magnetic field
is of dipolar nature (dipolar or odd parity) if the toroidal field is
antisymmetric across the equator; conversely, if the toroidal field is
symmetric across the equator then the global field is of quadrupolar
nature (quadrupolar or even parity). Some previous studies have found
solutions that are of quadrupolar nature using low diffusivity in their
kinematic dynamo models. It has been suggested that an additional alpha
effect at the base of the convection zone is necessary to produce the
observed dipolar parity (Dikpati & Gilman 2001; Bonanno et al. 2002).
However, other studies suggest that strong hemispheric coupling by
higher diffusivity is necessary for generation of the global dipolar
magnetic field without the presence of an additional alpha effect at the
base of the convection zone (Chatterjee et al. 2004; Chatterjee &
Choudhuri 2006; Hotta & Yokoyama 2010). These past studies have been
inspired with the primary aim of ensuring dipolar solutions to the
dynamo equations with the notion that the solar dynamo has always
persisted in the dipolar parity state with antisymmetric toroidal fields
across the equator.

On the other hand, unequal solar activity in northern and southern
hemispheres (known as hemispheric asymmetry) is well documented
(Waldmeier 1955, 1971; Chowdhury et al. 2013; McClintock & Norton 2013).
Observational evidence of strong hemispheric asymmetry exists during the
onset of grand-minima like episodes (Sokoloff & Nesme-Reibes 1994).
Theoretical and observational studies also suggest that hemispheric
polar field at the minimum of the solar cycle can be used as a precursor
to predict the amplitude of the next cycle (Schaten et al. 1978; Schaten
2005; Jiang et al. 2007; Karak & Nandy 2012; Muñoz-Jaramillo et al.
2013). Thus possibly, the hemispheric asymmetry of the polar field at
solar minima may be responsible for the hemispheric asymmetry in the
next cycle too. Feeding the data of the polar flux of previous cycles in
kinematic solar dynamo models, some studies are able to explain
hemispheric asymmetry like phenomenon in the current cycle (Goel &
Choudhuri, 2009). Details about hemispheric coupling and hemispheric
asymmetry can be found in a review paper by Norton et al. (2014).

To explore hemispheric asymmetry and parity issues and their
inter-relationship, we introduce stochastic fluctuations in the
Babcock-Leighton poloidal field source and find that stochastic
fluctuations can trigger the solar cycle into grand minima like
episodes. As proposed earlier, we confirm that an additional @xmath
-effect is necessary for cycle recovery. In the next step, we introduce
stochastic fluctuations in both the Babcock-Leighton mechanism and the
additional mean field @xmath -effect and find dynamo solutions can
self-consistently change parity. The above result begs the question
whether it is possible to predict parity flips in the Sun. We find that
parity flips in the sunspot cycle tend to occur when solar activity in
one hemisphere strongly dominates over the other hemisphere for a period
of time significantly longer than the sunspot cycle timescale. However,
strong domination of activity in one hemisphere does not necessarily
always guarantee a parity change.

### 3.2 Model

Our model is based on @xmath dynamo equations in the axisymmetric
spherical formulation wherein the dynamo equations are:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where, @xmath (i.e. @xmath ) and @xmath are the toroidal and vector
potential for the poloidal components of the magnetic field
respectively. Here @xmath is the differential rotation, @xmath is the
meridional flow, @xmath is the turbulent magnetic diffusivity and @xmath
.

Here, we use a two step radially dependent magnetic diffusivity profile
as described in Muñoz-Jaramillo et al. ( 2009 ) . In our case, the
diffusivity at the bottom of convection zone is @xmath , diffusivity in
the convection zone is @xmath and supergranular diffusivity is @xmath .
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath describes the transition from one
diffusivity value to another. We also use the same differential rotation
profile as described in Muñoz-Jaramillo et al. ( 2009 ) . We generate
the meridional circulation profile ( @xmath ) for a compressible flow
inside the convection zone by using a stream function along with mass
conservation constraint:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is estimated from the stream function (defined within @xmath ,
i.e., in the northern hemisphere) as described in Chatterjee, Nandy and
Choudhuri (2004):

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the factor which determines the maximum speed of the
flow. We use the following parameter values @xmath . Here @xmath is the
penetration depth of the meridional flow. The meridional circulation
profile in the southern hemisphere is generated by a mirror reflection
of the velocity profile across the equator. In this work, we use the
surface value of meridional circulation as @xmath .

Recent observations and theory both indicate that the Babcock-Leighton
mechanism for poloidal field creation plays an important role in the
solar cycle. In Equation (3.1), @xmath represents the Babcock-Leighton
mechanism. But modelling this mechanism to capture correctly the
underlying physics is a challenging task. Two different approaches exist
in the kinematic dynamo literature to model Babcock-Leighton
mechanism-one is alpha-coefficient formulation and another is double
ring approach proposed by Durney (1995). Nandy & Choudhuri (2001) has
shown that these two different approaches for modelling Babcock-Leighton
mechanism produce qualitatively similar result. However Muñoz-Jaramillo
et al. (2010) has shown that double ring approach is more successful in
capturing the observed surface dynamics compared to the
alpha-coefficient formulation. Motivated by this, here we model the
Babcock-Leighton mechanism (i.e., poloidal field source term) by the
emergence and flux dispersal of double-rings structures.

#### 3.2.1 Modelling Active Regions as Double Rings and Recreating the
poloidal field

We model the Babcock-Leighton mechanism by the methods of double ring
proposed by Durney (1997) and subsequently used by some other groups
(Nandy & Choudhuri 2001; Muñoz-Jaramillo et al. 2010; Nandy et al.
2011). In this algorithm we define the @xmath component of potential
vector @xmath corresponding to active region as:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a constant which ensures super-critical solutions and
strength of ring doublet is defined by @xmath . @xmath is basically the
magnetic flux. We define @xmath as:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the solar radius and @xmath . @xmath is the radial
extent of the active regions, i.e., how deep they extend from the
surface. This extent (surface to @xmath ) is motivated from results
indicating that active region flux tube disconnection happens around
this depth in the convection zone (Longcope & Choudhuri 2002). We define
@xmath in integral form as:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath ( @xmath ) defines the strength of positive (negative)
ring:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here @xmath is emergence co-latitude, @xmath is the diameter of each
polarity of the double ring and @xmath is the latitudinal distance
between the centers, where the angular distance between polarity centers
@xmath and the AR tilt angle is @xmath . We set @xmath , i.e. diameter
of ring doublet as @xmath . Figure 3.1 illustrates the variation of
field strength of double ring bipolar pair (namely, @xmath in red colour
and @xmath in blue colour) with colatitude. The top panel of figure
3.2(a) represents the axisymmetric signature of double rings in both
northern and southern hemisphere.

Now to recreate the poloidal field, first we check where the toroidal
field is higher than the buoyancy threshold at the bottom of convection
zone in both northern and southern hemispheres. Then we choose one of
the latitudes randomly from both the hemispheres simultaneously at a
certain interval of time, using a non uniform probability distribution
function such that randomly chosen latitudes remain within the observed
active latitudes. The probability distribution function is made to drop
steadily to zero between 30 @xmath (-30 @xmath ) and 40 @xmath (-40
@xmath ) in the northern (southern) hemisphere. Second, we calculate the
magnetic flux of this toroidal ring. Then we find tilt of corresponding
active region, using the expression given in Fan, Fisher & McClymont
(1994)

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the local field strength, @xmath is the flux associated
with the toroidal ring and @xmath is the emergence latitude. We set the
constant such that tilt angle lies between 3 @xmath and 12 @xmath .
Third, we remove a chunk of magnetic field with same angular size as the
emerging active region from this toroidal ring and calculate the
magnetic energy of the new partial toroidal ring. Then we fix the value
of toroidal field such that the energy of the full toroidal ring filled
with new magnetic field strength is the same as the magnetic field
strength for the partial toroidal ring. This exercise also generated the
strength of the ring doublet given by @xmath . Finally, we place the
ring duplets with these calculated properties at the near-surface layer
at the latitudes where they erupt, thus defining the source term @xmath
.

### 3.3 Results and Discussion

To explore the parity issue with our dynamo simulations we define the
parity @xmath following the prescription of Chatterjee, Nandy and
Choudhuri (2004):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are the amplitudes of the toroidal field at
@xmath latitude in both northern and southern hemispheres at the base of
the solar convection zone. We take the averages of @xmath and @xmath
over a dynamo period (i.e. @xmath and @xmath ) as zero. The value of
parity function should be +1 for quadrupolar parity and -1 for dipolar
parity. In the first scenario, we run dynamo simulations without
fluctuations, considering only the Babcock-Leighton mechanism as a
poloidal field generation process. We find the parity of the solutions
are always dipolar (see bottom panels of Fig. 3.2 for representative
solution).

The Babcock-Leighton mechanism is not a deterministic process but a
random one. This random nature arises due to scatter in tilt angles (an
observed fact) of bipolar sunspot pairs whose underlying flux tubes are
subject to turbulent buffeting during their ascent through the turbulent
convection zone (Longcope & Choudhuri 2002). Motivated by this fact, we
introduce stochastic fluctuations in the Babcock-Leighton mechanism by
redefining the coefficient @xmath (which governs the strength of the
ring doublet) as:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where for @xmath , we get supercritical solutions. @xmath represents a
uniform random function with values between -1 and +1 which changes
value at intervals of coherence time @xmath . @xmath and @xmath
represents percentile level of fluctuation and coherence time,
respectively. Although it is difficult to estimate the actual level of
fluctuation within the solar convection zone, our use of fluctuation
levels is motivated by the fluctuations present in the observed polar
field data from Wilcox Solar Observatory, the eddy velocity
distributions present in 3D MHD simulations of turbulent solar
convection (Racine et al. 2011; Passos et al. 2012) and some earlier
results (Charbonneau & Dikpati 2000; Dasi-Espuig et al. 2010). Our
choice of coherence time ( @xmath ) is motivated by the rise time of
flux tube through the turbulent convection zone (of the order of three
months, assuming the rise time scale is equal to the Alfvénic time
scale; see Caligari et al. 1995) and the time taken by the surface flows
to redistribute the sunspots (on the order of several months to a year).

Introduction of random fluctuations in the Babcock-Leighton mechanism
results in the decay and loss of the solar cycle after some time
depending on the level of fluctuations. The middle panel of figure 3.3
depicts such a solution where we introduce @xmath level of fluctuation
with a coherence time of 1 year. From observations of solar cycle and
the analysis of cosmogenic isotopes it is well-known that the Sun has
gone through several grand minima like episodes but has recovered
always. Now we introduce an additional poloidal field generation
mechanism operating on weak magnetic fields (which is below the
threshold magnetic field strength necessary for sunspot eruption, i.e.,
akin to the mean-field poloidal source).

We define this additional @xmath -effect as:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (3.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath controls the amplitude of this additional mean-field @xmath
-effect, @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath i.e. the upper threshold.
The function @xmath ensures that this additional @xmath effect is only
effective on weak magnetic field strengths (below the upper threshold
@xmath ) and the value of @xmath and @xmath confirms that this
additional mechanism takes place inside the bulk of the convection zone
(see top panel of figure 3.2(b) for radial profile of the mean field
@xmath -coefficient). In a model set up this way, poloidal field
generation takes place due to the combined effect of the
Babcock-Leighton mechanism and a mechanism effective on weak magnetic
fields. Simulations with stochastic fluctuation in both the
Babcock-Leighton mechanism and an additional mean field @xmath -effect
show that the cycle recovers from grand minima-like episodes and regains
normal activity levels (see bottom panel of figure 3.3 for
representative solution with fluctuations in both the Babcock-Leighton
and mean field @xmath ). This result confirms our earlier results based
on somewhat different dynamo models (Hazra et al. 2014; Passos et al.
2014).

Introducing fluctuations in both the Babcock-Leighton source ( @xmath )
and mean field poloidal source terms ( @xmath ), we find the parity of
dynamo solutions change (see top panels of figure 3.6 and 3.7). Earlier
studies indicate that the dipolar parity of dynamo solutions is
associated with strong hemispheric coupling – which can be obtained
either by increasing diffusivity or by introducing an additional mean
field @xmath effect (distributed through the convection zone, or
tachocline) (Dikpati & Gilman 2001; Chatterjee et al. 2004). These
models do not consider stochastic fluctuation in their simulation.
Introducing stochastic fluctuations in dynamo simulations we always find
solutions of single periodicity in both hemispheres even if we introduce
very large fluctuations in poloidal field source terms (both BL and mean
field @xmath effect).

What is the cause of parity change in our model? One possible reason is
the different levels of fluctuations in poloidal field source terms
associated with northern and southern hemispheres. Stochastic
fluctuations or randomness in the poloidal source is plausibly at the
heart of hemispheric asymmetry (Hoyng 1988). Thus we think that there
may be a relationship between hemispheric asymmetry and parity change.
To investigate the relationship between parity and hemispheric
asymmetry, we have to define hemispheric asymmetry in the context of our
simulations. In our kinematic flux transport dynamo model, we model the
Babcock-Leighton mechanism by double ring algorithm. We believe that
double ring algorithm is a more realistic way to capture the essence of
the Babcock-Leighton mechanism as well as sunspots. For this work, we
take the difference between double ring eruptions in the northern and
southern hemispheres as a measure of hemispheric asymmetry. We call this
difference the signed asymmetry and only the magnitude of this
difference as asymmetry for the rest of the chapter.

We find no north-south asymmetry in the simulated solar cycle if we
perform dynamo simulations without stochastic fluctuation. Thus our
result confirms the idea that stochastic fluctuation is the cause for
hemispheric asymmetry. Interestingly, we find that yearly averaged
absolute asymmetry obtained from our simulation is not stochastic,
rather it shows a systematic periodic behaviour. We also find that
hemispheric asymmetry obtained from our simulation is stronger at solar
cycle maximum but also sometimes significant at solar cycle minima. We
note that maximum amplitude of yearly averaged absolute asymmetry time
series obtained from our simulation is 200, this is because in our
double ring algorithm we allow maximum 200 double ring eruptions in a
year.

To confirm the systematic periodic behaviour of hemispheric asymmetry,
we have performed a wavelet analysis of both observational and simulated
asymmetry time series. The Royal Greenwich Observatory provides the
monthly mean hemispheric sunspot area data series (in unit of millionths
of a hemisphere) from 1874 to present. We have created a yearly data
series from this data set by averaging over 12 month to examine
hemispheric asymmetry. We take the absolute difference between the areas
of northern and southern hemispheres as a definition of observed
hemispheric asymmetry. Figs. 3.4 and 3.5 show the results of wavelet
analysis of observational absolute asymmetry and simulated absolute
asymmetry data series. Third and fourth panels of Fig 3.4 and 3.5 shows
the wavelet power spectrum and global wavelet analysis of observational
and simulated absolute asymmetry time series respectively. We find a
clear signature of 11 year periodicity in both observed and simulated
asymmetry time series which is also outside the cone of influence.
Distortion of wavelet power spectra occurs inside the region named the
cone of influence, thus periodicities in these regions are unreliable.
The significant periodicities in both observed and simulated asymmetry
time series are already present in the hemispheric sunspot area time
series and the simulated toroidal field time series, respectively, which
basically corresponds to the underlying magnetic cycle. Thus, we
conclude that the periodicity in the asymmetry reflects the underlying
periodicity of the parent cycle.

Next we focus our attention on the relationship between parity and
hemispheric asymmetry obtained from our dynamo simulations. Figures 3.6
and 3.7 are the representative plots of parity and signed asymmetry
relationship with different level of fluctuations. The top panels in
Figure 3.6 and 3.7 shows the time evolution of parity and 22 year
averaged signed asymmetry. Comparing the time evolutions of parity and
signed asymmetry we find that parity changes are always associated with
strong dominance of eruptions in one hemisphere for a long period of
time. We confirm our findings from the simulated butterfly diagrams. The
second, third, fourth and fifth panels of figure 3.6 and 3.7 are the
corresponding butterfly diagrams for different time intervals where
parity change takes place. We also notice that on some occasions there
is a strong dominance of eruptions in one hemisphere, but the parity
does not change, however, these occasions are rare.

We perform several numerical experiments with different levels of
fluctuations in both poloidal field source terms and find that our model
results are robust with different level of fluctuations.

### 3.4 Conclusions

Here, we first perform solar dynamo simulations considering only the
Babcock-Leighton mechanism for poloidal field generation. We find that
stochastic fluctuations in the Babcock-Leighton mechanism is a possible
candidate for triggering entry into grand minima like episodes. We also
confirm that an additional mean-field like @xmath -effect capable of
working on weak fields is necessary for recovery of the solar cycle.
Next we perform simulations where the poloidal field generation takes
place through the combined effect of both the Babcock-Leighton mechanism
and mean field @xmath -effect. By introducing stochastic fluctuations in
the poloidal field source terms we find dynamo solutions of changing
parity. Earlier results in a different context (without any
consideration of stochastic fluctuations in the dynamo source terms) has
been indicative that the parity issue may be related to the coupling
between hemispheres (Chatterjee & Choudhuri 2006). We demonstrate that
presence of stochastic fluctuations makes hemispheric coupling weak.
Thus there may be a possible relationship between hemispheric asymmetry
and parity change. A closer investigations reveals that parity changes
are likely to occur only when one hemisphere strongly dominates over the
other hemisphere for a long period of time persisting over several solar
cycles.

Systematic observations over the past century indicates that the solar
magnetic field has always been in the dipolar parity state. However, it
has been noted that there was large asymmetry at the recovery phase of
the Maunder minimum, wherein, appearance of sunspots were almost
confined at the southern hemisphere (Ribes & Nesme-Ribes 1993). At this
point, it is unclear whether this was related to any parity change in
the Sun before or after the Maunder minimum. Independent simulations
using low order dynamo models also predict the possibility of parity
flipping in the Sun (Beer et al. 1998; Knobloch et al. 1998). Thus, our
results, taken together with other investigations point out that
hemispheric coupling, parity shifts and the occurrence of grand minima
episodes may be related. These interrelationship needs to be
investigated further and may provide a pathway for predicting parity
shifts and the onset of grand minima episodes.

## Chapter 4 A New Paradigm of Magnetic Field Dynamics at the Basis of
the Sunspot Cycle Based on Turbulent Pumping

Four hundred years of sunspot observations show the existence of a
11-year periodicity in the appearance of sunspots. At the turn of the 20
@xmath Century, George Ellery Hale discovered that sunspots are strongly
magnetized and subsequently the sunspot cycle came to be recognized as
the underlying magnetic cycle of the Sun. Solar magnetism is thought to
originate via a magnetohydrodynamic dynamo mechanism relying on plasma
flows in the Sun’s interior. While a fully self-consistent theoretical
model of the solar cycle remains elusive, significant progress has been
made based on convection simulations and kinematic, flux transport
dynamo modelling of the solar interior. The success of these flux
transport dynamo models are largely dependent upon a single-cell
meridional circulation with a deep equatorward component at the base of
the Sun’s convection zone. However, recent observations suggest that the
meridional flow may in fact be very shallow (confined to the top 10% of
the Sun) and more complex than previously thought. Taken together these
observations cast serious doubts on the validity of flux transport
dynamo models of the solar cycle. By accounting for the turbulent
pumping of magnetic flux as evidenced in magnetohydrodynamic simulations
of solar convection, we demonstrate that flux transport dynamo models
can generate solar-like magnetic cycles even if the meridional flow is
shallow, or altogether absent. These results imply that substantial
revisions may be necessary to our current understanding of magnetic flux
transport processes within the Sun and by extension, the interior of
other solar-like stars.

### 4.1 Introduction

Despite early, pioneering attempts to self-consistently model the
interactions of turbulent plasma flows and magnetic fields in the
context of the solar cycle (Gilman 1983; Glatzmaier 1985) such full MHD
simulations are still not successful in yielding solutions that can
match solar cycle observations. This task is indeed difficult, for the
range of density and pressure scale heights, scale of turbulence and
high Reynolds number that characterize the SCZ is difficult to capture
even in the most powerful supercomputers. An alternative approach to
modelling the solar cycle is based on solving the magnetic induction
equation in the SCZ with observed plasma flows as inputs and with
additional physics gleaned from simulations of convection and flux tube
dynamics. These so called flux transport dynamo models have shown great
promise in recent years in addressing a wide variety of solar cycle
problems (Charbonneau 2010; Ossendrijver 2003).

In particular, solar dynamo models based on the Babcock-Leighton
mechanism for poloidal field generation have been more successful in
explaining diverse observational features of the solar cycle (Dikpati &
Charbonneau 1999; Nandy & Choudhuri 2002; Chatterjee et al.
2004;Choudhuri et al. 2004; Nandy et al. 2011; Choudhuri & Karak 2012,
Hazra et al. 2014; Passos et al. 2014). Recent observations also
strongly favor the Babcock-Leighton mechanism as a major source for
poloidal field generation (Dasi-Espuig et al. 2010; Muñoz-Jaramillo et
al. 2013). In this scenario, the poloidal field generation is
essentially predominantly confined to near-surface layers. For the
dynamo to function efficiently, the toroidal field that presumably
resides deep in the interior has to reach the near-surface layers for
the Babcock-Leighton poloidal source to be effective. This is achieved
by the buoyant transport of magnetic flux from the Sun’s interior to its
surface (through sunspot eruptions). Subsequent to this the poloidal
field so generated at near-surface layers must be transported back to
the solar interior, where differential rotation can generate the
toroidal field. The deep meridional flow assumed in such models (See
Fig. 4.1, left-hemisphere) plays a significant role in this flux
transport process and is thought to govern the period of the sunspot
cycle (Charbonneau & Dikpati 2000; Hathaway et al. 2003, Yeates et al.
2008, Hazra et al. 2014). Moreover, a fundamentally crucial role
attributed to the deep equatorward meridional flow is that it allows the
Parker-Yoshimura sign rule (Parker 1955; Yoshimura 1975) to be overcome,
which would otherwise result in poleward propagating dynamo waves in
contradiction to observations that the sunspot belt migrates
equatorwards with the progress of the cycle (Choudhuri et al. 1995;
G.Hazra et al. 2014; Passos et al. 2015; Belusz et al. 2015).

While the poleward meridional flow at the solar surface is well observed
(Hathaway & Rightmire 2010, 2011) the internal meridional flow profile
has remained largely unconstrained. A recent study utilizing solar
supergranules (Hathaway 2012) indicates that the meridional flow is
confined to within the top 10% of the Sun (Fig. 4.1, right-hemisphere) –
much shallower than previously thought. Independent studies utilizing
helioseismic inversions is also indicative that the equatorward
meridional counterflow may be located at shallow depths (Mitra-Kraev &
Thompson 2007; Zhao et al. 2013). The latter also infer the flow to be
multi-cellular and more complex. Here, utilizing a newly developed
state-of-the-art Babcock-Leighton flux transport dynamo model, we
explore the impact of a shallow meridional flow on our current
understanding of the solar cycle and provide a new paradigm which
resolves the significant challenges posed by these new observations.

### 4.2 Results

Our flux transport solar dynamo model (see chapter 3) solves for the
coupled, evolution equation for the axisymmetric toroidal and poloidal
components of the solar magnetic field with an analytic fit to the
observed solar differential rotation, a two-step turbulent diffusivity
profile (which ensures a smooth transition to low levels of diffusivity
beneath the base of the convection zone), and a new implementation of a
double-ring algorithm for buoyant sunspot eruptions that best captures
the Babcock-Leighton mechanism for poloidal field generation
(Muñoz-Jaramillo et al. 2013; Hazra & Nandy 2013) and which has been
tested thoroughly in other contexts. To bring out the significance of
the recent observations, we first consider a single cell, shallow
meridional flow, confined only to the top 10% of the convection zone
(Fig. 4.1, right-hemisphere). In the first scenario we seek to answer
the following question: Can solar-like cycles be sustained through
magnetic field dynamics completely confined to the top 10% of the Sun?

In these simulations, first we allow magnetic flux tubes to buoyantly
erupt from 0.90 @xmath (i.e., the depth to which the shallow flow is
confined) when they exceed a buoyancy threshold of @xmath Gauss (G). In
this case we find that the dynamo remains sub-critical (see Fig. 4.2)
with no sunspot eruptions, implying that a solar-like cycle cannot be
produced in this case. Given that the upper layers of the SCZ is highly
turbulent (characterized by a high turbulent diffusivity), storage and
amplification of strong magnetic flux tubes may not be possible in these
layers (Parker 1975; Moreno-Insertis 1983) and therefore this result is
not unexpected. In the second scenario with a shallow meridional flow,
we allow magnetic flux tubes to buoyantly erupt from 0.71 @xmath , i.e.
from base of the convection zone. In this case we get periodic solutions
but analysis of the butterfly diagrams (taken both at the base of SCZ
and near solar surface) shows that the toroidal field belts have almost
symmetrical poleward and equatorward branches with no significant
equatorward migration (see Fig. 4.3). Moreover the solutions always
display quadrupolar parity in contradiction with solar cycle
observations. Clearly, a shallow flow poses a serious problem for solar
cycle models.

We note that most flux transport solar dynamo models do not include the
process of turbulent pumping of magnetic flux. Magnetoconvection
simulations supported by theoretical considerations (Brandenburg et al.
1996; Tobias et al. 2001; Dorch & Nordlund 2001; Käpylä et al. 2006;
Pipin & Seehafer 2009; Rogachevskii et al. 2011) have established that
turbulent pumping preferentially transports magnetic fields vertically
downwards – likely mediated via strong downward convective plumes which
are particularly effective on weak magnetic fields (such as the poloidal
component). In strong rotation regimes, there is also a significant
latitudinal component of turbulent pumping. The few studies that exist
on the impact of turbulent pumping in the context of flux transport
dynamo models show it to be dynamically important in the maintenance of
solar-like parity and solar-cycle memory (Guerrero & de Gouveia Dal Pino
2008; Karak & Nandy 2012; Jiang et al. 2013). Motivated by these
considerations, we introduce both radial and latitudinal turbulent
pumping in the dynamo model with shallow meridional flow. The turbulent
pumping profile is determined from independent MHD simulations of solar
magnetoconvection (Ossendrijver et al. 2002; Käpylä et al. 2006).
Profiles for radial and latitudinal turbulent pumping ( @xmath and
@xmath ) are:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (4.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

The value of @xmath and @xmath determines the amplitude of @xmath and
@xmath respectively. Fig. 4.4(a) and (b) shows that radial pumping speed
is negative throughout the convection zone corresponds to downward
movement of magnetized plasma and vanishes below @xmath , the radial
pumping speed is maximum near the poles and decreases towards the
equator. Fig. 4.4(c) and (d) shows that latitudinal pumping speed is
positive (negative) in the convection zone of northern (southern)
hemisphere and vanishes below the overshoot layer. Contour plots of
turbulent pumping profiles are shown in Fig. 4.5.

Dynamo simulations with turbulent pumping generate solar-like magnetic
cycles (Fig. 4.6 and Fig. 4.7). Now the toroidal field belt migrates
equatorward, the solution exhibits solar-like parity and the correct
phase relationship between the toroidal and poloidal components of the
magnetic field (see Fig. 4.7). Evidently, the coupling between the
poloidal source at the near-surface layers with the deeper layers of the
convection zone where the toroidal field is stored and amplified, the
equatorward migration of the sunspot-forming toroidal field belt and
correct solar-like parity is due to the important role played by
turbulent pumping. We note if the speed of the latitudinal pumping in on
order of 1.0 ms @xmath the solutions are always of dipolar parity
irrespective of whether one initializes the model with dipolar or
quadrupolar parity. Interestingly, the latitudinal migration rate of the
sunspot belt as observed is of the same order.

The above result begs the question whether flux transport solar dynamo
models based on the Babcock-Leighton mechanism that include turbulent
pumping can operate without meridional plasma flows. To test this, we
remove meridional circulation completely from our model and perform
simulations with turbulent pumping included. We find that this model
generates solar-like sunspot cycles (see Fig. 4.8) which is
qualitatively similar to the earlier solution with both pumping and
shallow meridional flow indicating that it is turbulent pumping which
predominantly determines the dynamics. This surprising and
un-anticipated result suggests a new scenario for magnetic field
transport leading to the generation of the solar cycle which we discuss
in the next section.

### 4.3 Discussions

In summary, we have demonstrated that flux transport dynamo models of
the solar cycle based on the Babcock-Leighton mechanism for poloidal
field generation does not require a deep equatorward meridional plasma
flow to function effectively. In fact, our results indicate that when
turbulent pumping of magnetic flux is taken in to consideration, dynamo
models can generate solar-like magnetic cycles even without any
meridional circulation. These findings have significant implications for
our understanding of the solar cycle. First of all, the serious
challenges that was apparently posed by observations of a shallow (and
perhaps complex, multi-cellular) meridional flow on the very premise of
flux transport dynamo models stands resolved. Turbulent pumping
essentially takes over the role of meridional circulation by
transporting magnetic fields from the near-surface solar layers to the
deep interior, ensuring that efficient recycling of toroidal and
poloidal fields components across the SCZ is not compromised. While
these findings augur well for dynamo models of the solar cycle, they
also imply that we need to revisit many aspects of our current
understanding.

It has been argued earlier that the interplay between competing flux
transport processes determine the dynamical memory of the solar cycle
governing solar cycle predictability (Yeates et al. 2008). If turbulent
pumping is the dominant flux transport process as seems plausible based
on the simulations presented herein, the cycle memory would be short and
this is indeed supported by independent studies (Karak & Nandy 2012) and
solar cycle observations (Muñoz-Jaramillo et al. 2013). It is noteworthy
that on the other hand, if meridional circulation were to be the
dominant flux transport process, the solar cycle memory would be
relatively longer and last over several cycles. This is not borne out by
observations.

Previous results in the context of the maintenance of solar-like dipolar
parity have relied on a strong turbulent diffusion to couple the
Northern and Southern hemispheres of the Sun (Chatterjee et al. 2004),
or a dynamo @xmath -effect which is co-spatial with the deep equatorward
counterflow in the meridional circulation assumed in most flux transport
dynamo models (Dikpati & Gilman 2001). However, our results indicate
that turbulent pumping is equally capable of coupling the Northern and
Southern solar hemispheres and aid in the maintenance of solar-like
dipolar parity. This is in keeping with earlier, independent simulations
based on a somewhat different dynamo model (Guerrero & de Gouveia Dal
Pino 2008).

Most importantly, our results point out a completely new alternative to
circumventing the Parker-Yoshimura sign rule (Parker 1955; Yoshimura
1975) that would otherwise imply poleward propagating sunspot belts in
conflict with observations of equatorward propagation of sunspot belt
with the progress of the solar cycle. While a deep meridional
counterflow is currently thought to circumvent this constraint and force
the toroidal field belt equatorward, our results show that the
latitudinal component of turbulent pumping provides a viable alternative
to overcoming the Parker-Yoshimura sign rule.

We note however that our theoretical results should not be taken as
support for the existence of a shallow meridional flow, rather we point
out that flux transport dynamo models of the solar cycle are equally
capable for working with a shallow or non-existent meridional flow, as
long as the turbulent pumping of magnetic flux is accounted for. Taken
together, these insights suggest a plausible new paradigm for dynamo
models of the solar cycle, wherein, turbulent pumping of magnetic flux
effectively replaces the important roles that are currently thought to
be mediated via a deep meridional circulation within the Sun’s interior.
Since the dynamical memory and thus predictability of the solar cycle
depends on the dominant mode of magnetic flux transport in the Sun’s
interior, this would also imply that physics-based prediction models of
long-term space weather need to adequately include the physics of
turbulent pumping of magnetic fields.

## Chapter 5 Observational Studies of Magnetic Field Dynamics in the
Solar Atmosphere

After discussing the generation process of large scale magnetic fields
inside the Sun, in the second part of this thesis we will concentrate on
observations of the photospheric magnetic field of the Sun and constrain
the role of photospheric magnetic fields in atmospheric dynamics. Two
major explosive events in the solar atmosphere, namely, solar flare and
coronal mass ejection, release huge amounts of plasma to outer space.
One of the major outstanding problem in astrophysics is the coronal
heating problem: the solar corona is much hotter compared to the
photosphere. In this chapter, we will discuss some observational
techniques and the current theoretical understanding for explaining the
observations of the solar atmosphere.

### 5.1 Measuring large scale solar magnetic field

Zeeman effect is a widely used method to measure solar magnetic fields.
In this effect energy levels of atom split into several levels in
presence of static magnetic field (based on degeneracy of energy level).
From the atomic absorption lines interspersed in the black-body
continuum spectra, one can easily choose certain magnetically sensitive
lines which show larger splitting due to their large Lande-g factor. One
can measure different states of polarization from these magnetically
sensitive lines, in terms of Stokes parameters I, Q, U, V. The Stokes
parameter are used to describe the polarization state of electromagnetic
radiation. These parameters are easily measurable by techniques of
remote sensing. Stokes parameters of a partially polarized light are
defined as (Stokes, 1852):

@xmath

@xmath

@xmath

@xmath
Stokes I vector represents integrated unpolarized light. Stokes Q
parameter represents the difference between the x and y axis intensities
transmitted through a polaroid. Parameter U is the difference between
intensities transmitted through a polaroid having axis at @xmath and
@xmath to the x-axis and parameter V is the difference between between
the amount of right handed circularly polarized light and left handed
circularly polarized light present in the light.

It is possible to determine the strength and direction of magnetic field
from the measurement of such polarized signals, using Stokes inversion
techniques (Skumanich & Lites, 1987).

### 5.2 Effects of large scale solar magnetic field

#### 5.2.1 Null Points and Current Sheet

Null point is the point where all three components of a magnetic field
vanishes. It is a general feature of magnetic fields containing multiple
sources, e.g., a field produced by two bar magnets. Current sheets can
form only when the medium is conducting plasma, unlike neutral points
which can form irrespective of the background medium whether it is
conducting plasma or neutral gas.

A thin current carrying layer across which the magnetic field changes in
magnitude or direction or both, is a current sheet. It has been shown
that null points typically give rise to current sheets in conducting
plasma. R. G. Giovanelli (1946) and F. Hoyle (1949) first suggested that
magnetic X-type null points are preferred locations for plasma heating
and initiation of solar flares. T. G. Cowling (1953) pointed out that to
power a solar flare, a current sheet of only few meters thickness is
needed. Around almost the same time, J. W. Dungey (1953) suggested that
such current sheets can form by collapsing magnetic field lines near an
X-type null point.

#### 5.2.2 Magnetic Reconnection

The Magnetic induction equation is given by,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now the diffusive term is negligible compared to time derivative term if

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

In that case flux conservation arises because of the balance between the
terms @xmath and @xmath i.e., magnetic field is coupled within the
plasma. This mechanism is easily applicable for high Reynold’s number
plasma system i.e., for astrophysical plasma. So we can safely assume
flux freezing condition as long as evolution time scale (t) is small
compared to diffusion time scale. This flux freezing condition
introduces strong constraints on the dynamics of astrophysical magnetic
fields as it implies that connectivity between field lines can not break
and their topology is preserved. We can say, two magnetic configurations
are topologically equivalent if one can be deformed into the other by
continuous motion (without cutting or pasting). But if it is required to
cut and paste field lines, then they are of different magnetic topology.
Now, we can state the flux freezing statement as: In a time t, magnetic
lines of force can slip through the plasma up to the distance @xmath .
If our scale of interest (say, @xmath ) is very large compared to
distance l then flux freezing condition is a good approximation.
However, there are also some situations, when our scale of interest (
@xmath ) is small compared to l in which case this flux freezing
condition is no longer valid. In that case there might be breaking and
reattachment between pair of field lines, which is widely known as
magnetic reconnection. Bringing opposing field lines together leads to
such large current densities that there is always break in field lines
causing a change in topology even if the resistivity is very small.
These intense thin current layers (also known as current sheet) are the
location for magnetic reconnection.

As topology controls the equilibrium state of the plasma, change in
topology corresponds to a change in equilibrium from one configuration
to another. On the other hand, change in equilibrium configuration
corresponds to conversion of magnetic energy to other forms of energy
like heat. If this change is sudden then there is a release of large
amounts of energy. This may be the basis for explosive events in solar
atmosphere like solar flares and coronal mass ejections.

Sweet (1958) and Parker (1957) first quantitatively modelled magnetic
reconnection in two dimension. In their model, they considered the
presence of a thin magnetic diffusion layer along the whole boundary
between the opposite magnetic fields (thickness of diffusion layer (
@xmath ) @xmath length of diffusion layer ( @xmath )) and they calculate
the rate for magnetic reconnection ( @xmath ):

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the Alfvén velocity and S ( @xmath ) is known as
Lundquist number. It was found that the resulting reconnection rate is
very slow and insufficient to explain the energy release in solar flares
(Parker, 1963).

Petschek (1964) came up with a brilliant solution of this problem. As
breaking and reconnection of field lines is a topological process, thus
it is only necessary to break and reconnect field lines near one point.
For magnetic reconnection the resistivity of the rest of the flux system
is not important. Thus he reduced the size of the diffusion layer to a
narrow area ( @xmath ), much less than the length of Sweet-Parker
current sheet. As the size of diffusion region is very narrow, thus
plasma inflow speed (let say, @xmath ) abruptly changes to outflow speed
(let say, @xmath ) thus slow-mode shock arises in the Petschek model.
Keeping this in mind, the reconnection rate turns out to be:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

This rate is much faster than Sweet-Parker reconnection rate and is able
to explain the energy released in solar flare like events.

#### 5.2.3 Magnetic Nonpotentiality

The Navier-Stokes equation for incompressible flow can be written as:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

when plasma velocity ( @xmath ) is small, then the Navier-Stokes
equation reduces to:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

In case of solar atmosphere, both the pressure gradient ( @xmath ) and
gravitational term ( @xmath ) are important in the dynamical
equilibrium. We can subsume the gravity term in the pressure term by
expressing it as the gradient of a potential; thus total effective
pressure is the term which adjusts itself to equilibrate the Lorentz
force. Thus we can write:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

Using the vector identity, @xmath ; we get:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

The ratio of gas to magnetic pressure is defined as the plasma- @xmath
parameter i.e., @xmath . In case of the solar corona, due to low density
the plasma- @xmath is small and one can consider:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

A magnetic field satisfying this condition is known as a force-free
field. Now we can satisfy this condition in three possible ways. First,
@xmath everywhere but we are not interested in this situation. Second,
@xmath i.e., current vanishes. Now @xmath implies @xmath ; thus we can
write:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is any scalar potential. This magnetic field configuration
is known as potential magnetic field or current-free field. Another
possibility is:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a scalar which is a function of position. If @xmath then
current vanishes and magnetic field corresponds to potential field. But
if @xmath then current does not vanish; in this case the corresponding
magnetic field is known as nonpotential field. So one can take current
as a measure of magnetic nonpotentiality. Using vector identity @xmath ,
we can show that:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

It indicates that @xmath does not change along field line. So @xmath is
not a scalar function but a constant. Magnetic field satisfying
condition (5.11) with constant @xmath is known as linear force free
field equation.

If we write the integral form of equation (5.11) with constant @xmath ,
then we get:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

The right hand side of the equation is @xmath times the amount of
magnetic field passing through the surface bounded by C while left hand
side represents the amount of magnetic field integrated around the
circumference of the surface S. Thus relative sizes of these two
components are indicated by the force-free parameter @xmath , i.e., the
amount of twist in the field. This is the physical significance of the
force-free parameter @xmath . The nonpoteniality parameter represents
the departure of the force-free field (observed field in corona) from
the potential field.

To model shear arcades Priest (1982) and Sturrock (1994) considered a
loop arcade which consists of a sequence of loop with a common axis of
curvature and generated a shearing motion by shifting the footpoints
parallel to the neutral line on one side along the solar surface. The
shear angle of this arcade is higher when the shearing motion is applied
for longer time. It was shown that:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

i.e., shear angle ( @xmath ) is proportional to @xmath . So if there is
an increase in shear angle, it also indicates the increase in the
nonpotentiality parameter @xmath . Thus shear angle is one of the major
indicator of the magnetic field nonpotentiality.

Now from the study of uniformly twisted, cylindrical, force-free flux
tubes (Priest, 1982); it was shown that both force free parameter @xmath
and geometric shear angle (i.e., angle between twisted and untwisted
field lines) is proportional to the number of twist (say, @xmath ). Thus
one can also use geometric shear angle ( @xmath ) as an estimate of
force-free parameter @xmath . Pevtsov et al. (1997) performed an
observational study about the relationship between geometric shear angle
( @xmath ) and force-free parameter @xmath and found a strong linear
correlation between them. Thus one can measure the nonpotentiality of
magnetic field by measuring shear angle or the twist parameter ( @xmath
).

#### 5.2.4 Magnetic Helicity

Moreau (1961) and Moffatt (1969) have pointed out that a pseudo scalar
quantity called helicity of the form @xmath can be related with
topological properties of field lines of @xmath . Similarly, for
magnetic field, one can define magnetic helicity as:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath ; @xmath is the vector potential. This quantity is the
measure of the linkage between magnetic field lines.

Woltjer (1958) showed that for a perfectly conducting plasma (ideal MHD,
where field lines are frozen inside the plasma); magnetic helicity is a
conserved quantity. He also proved that, if magnetic helicity is
invariant, minimum magnetic energy field configuration always satisfies
the force-free condition i.e.,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

Taylor (1974) applied this idea to the process of plasma relaxation. He
suggested that reconnection can remove all topological constraints
except total helicity conservation, making the constant @xmath
force-free field accessible for plasma relaxation process. Thus final
state after plasma relaxation would be a linear, force-free magnetic
field configuration. Note that these two theorems are only valid in case
of low- @xmath plasma. Magnetic helicity is also an invariant quantity
during the evolution of coronal structures, like active region loops
(Kusano et al. 2002); flare loops (Pevtsov et al. 1996); filaments
(Pevtsov 2002) etc. So in summary magnetic helicity is a globally
invariant quantity even under resistive processes like magnetic
reconnection.

It has also been shown that magnetic helicity follows a hemispheric sign
rule - negative in northern hemisphere and positive in southern
hemisphere. However this rule is not very strong, there are also
indications about the reversal of helicity sign rule at activity minimum
periods. As vector potential @xmath is not unique, thus it is not
possible to calculate a unique value of helicity. Also lack of
observations at different heights of solar atmosphere makes the direct
calculation of magnetic helicity impossible. Thus to search for
hemispheric sign rule, people proposed proxies for magnetic helicity.
Seehafer (1990) first used the constant force-free @xmath as a proxy for
magnetic twist (i.e., fraction of magnetic helicity) and found that sign
of @xmath follows the hemispheric rule - negative in northern hemisphere
and positive in southern hemisphere. Later Pevtsov et al. (1995) studied
the helicity sign rule using @xmath as a proxy for magnetic twist and
found that 75 % of active regions in northern hemisphere and 69 % of
active regions in southern hemisphere follow similar sign rule. @xmath
is the value of @xmath for which computed transverse field best matches
with the observed transverse magnetic field. But all of this above
method uses force-free field equation, but in reality the photosphere is
not force free. So use of these methods for calculating twist is
questionable (Leka et al. 2005).

#### 5.2.5 The Coronal Heating Problem

One of the major unsolved issues in solar physics is why the corona is
so hot (million degree Kelvin), while the temperature of underlying
photosphere is only 6000 degrees. According to the second law of
thermodynamics it is expected that temperature will drop down steadily
above the photosphere. Temperature variation along the different layers
of solar atmosphere are shown in Fig. 5.2. Although significant progress
has been made in addresing the coronal heating problem this problem
remains hotly debated. But there is a general agreement that the heating
energy comes from photospheric magnetic field. Solar coronal phenomenona
are generally classified into three categories: active region
corona(AR), quiet Sun corona (QS) and coronal holes (CH). Temperature
trends in these regions are: coronal holes @xmath 1 MK (lowest
temperature); quiet sun corona @xmath 2 MK; flaring active regions (AR)
@xmath 2-6 MK (hottest) (Aschwanden 2004). The magnetic field structure
in the coronal hole is dominated by open magnetic field lines, while in
quiet sun and active region corona are mostly closed. In recent time,
theories of coronal heating have been broadly classified into two
subcategories– one is DC heating model i.e., nanoflare heating model,
and another is AC heating model i.e., wave heating theory.

Photospheric drivers, say random motion of magnetic field line
footpoints, plausibly provides the source of energy required for coronal
heating. Magnetic disturbances created by photospheric changes propagate
towards corona with the Alfvén speed ( @xmath ). In AC heating model
(Wave heating theory), photospheric forcing changes magnetic footpoints
rapidly thereby generating waves. These waves propagate up into the
corona, get dissipated there and heat the coronal plasma locally. On the
other hand, in the DC heating model, photospheric forcing changes
magnetic loop footpoints at time scales much longer than the Alfvén
transit time thus it allows magnetic stresses to build up over time and
dissipate in the corona due to magnetic reconnection, producing heating
(Parker 1988). So the basic problem is to find the exact mechanism which
is responsible for coronal heating. In chapter 6 of this thesis, we
study the relationship between coronal X-ray intensity and active region
magnetic fields using high resolution Hinode data and discuss the
consequences of our results in the context of coronal heating theory.

#### 5.2.6 Solar Flares

A solar flare is an energetic explosive event high up in the solar
atmosphere without any visible energy source. This mystery was resolved
when it was understood that it may be produced by an instability of the
underlying magnetic field configuration. Due to this event, the magnetic
field configuration evolves into a more stable state by changing and
reconnecting the magnetic topology.

Due to the random motions of the magnetic footpoints in the solar
photosphere, magnetic field lines are twisted. Because of this twisted
motion, there is a increase in the magnetic energy much above than the
energy of Sun’s vacuum dipole field. Now if a rising bubble of the
magnetic field from the photosphere collides with the twisted magnetic
field, then it produces a reverse field configuration on a very short
scale. Then reconnection takes place in this thin region and lowers the
energy of the previous field by releasing the twist. In this way, we can
explain solar flare like events. Recent observational studies suggest a
close relation between photospheric magnetic non-potentiality and flare
productivity (Jing et al. 2006; Falconer et al. 2008); which may be
helpful for predicting solar flares. But a method of calculating
magnetic non-potentiality in terms of twist by using force-free field
equation is questionable as the photosphere is not force free. In
chapter 7 of this thesis, we use a new flux-tube fitting technique to
calculate the best-fit twist ( @xmath ; one of the measures of magnetic
non-potentiality) and critical twist threshold necessary for determining
the susceptibility of magnetic flux tubes to kink instability mechanism
( @xmath ). We also discuss the importance of the relationship between
@xmath and @xmath for predicting solar flare like events.

## Chapter 6 The Relationship between Solar Coronal X-Ray Brightness and
Active Region Magnetic Fields

In this chapter, using high-resolution observations of nearly
co-temporal and co-spatial Solar Optical Telescope spectropolarimeter
and X-Ray Telescope coronal X-ray data onboard Hinode , we revisit the
problematic relationship between global magnetic quantities and coronal
X-ray brightness. Co-aligned vector magnetogram and X-ray data were used
for this study. The total X-ray brightness over active regions is well
correlated with integrated magnetic quantities such as the total
unsigned magnetic flux, the total unsigned vertical current and the
area-integrated square of the vertical and horizontal magnetic fields.
On accounting for the inter-dependence of the magnetic quantities, we
inferred that the total magnetic flux is the primary determinant of the
observed integrated X-ray brightness. Our observations indicate that a
stronger coronal X-ray flux is not related to a higher non-potentiality
of active-region magnetic fields. The data even suggest a slight
negative correlation between X-ray brightness and a proxy of
active-region non-potentiality. Although there are small numerical
differences in the established correlations, the main results are
qualitatively consistent over two different X-ray filters, the Al-poly
and Ti-Poly filters, which confirms the strength of our conclusions and
validate and extend earlier studies that used low-resolution data. We
discuss the implications of our results and the constraints they set on
theories of solar coronal heating.

### 6.1 Introduction

Solar active-region coronal loops appear bright in EUV and X-ray
wavelengths, which is indicative of very high temperatures of the order
of a million degrees Kelvin. The origins behind these high-temperature
coronal structures remain elusive. An energy flux of about 10 @xmath
ergs cm @xmath s @xmath is required to maintain this high temperature of
the coronal plasma (Withbroe & Noyes 1977). It has been suggested that
there is a one-to-one correspondence between the location of the
magnetic fields in the photosphere and bright coronal structures in the
corona (Vaiana et al. 1973) and we know that most of the coronal X-ray
luminosity is concentrated within active-region magnetic-flux systems.

Several theories have been proposed to explain the heating of coronal
structures (Zirker 1993; Narain & Ulmschneider 1996; Aschwanden 2004;
Klimchuk 2006). These theories are broadly classified into two
subcategories: DC heating model, i.e. the nano-flare heating model
(Parker 1988), and the AC heating model, i.e. the wave-heating theory (
e.g. see the review by Aschwanden, 2004). In the AC heating model,
high-frequency MHD waves are generated in the magnetic foot points of
active regions and propagate through magnetic loops in the corona. These
waves dissipate their energy in the corona (Narain & Ulmschneider 1996).
Although recent observations reveal that MHD waves propagate into the
quiet solar corona (Tomczyk et al. 2007), it is unclear whether these
MHD waves alone can heat the corona to such a high temperature (Mandrini
et al. 2000; Cirtain et al. 2013). Alternatively, DC-heating models are
proposed to explain the heating of active regions where nanoflare-like
small bursts (each of energy @xmath erg) can liberate energy by magnetic
reconnection – driven by the constant shuffling of magnetic foot points
by turbulent convective motions just beneath the photosphere (Parker
1988; Cirtain et al. 2013). It has been suggested recently that waves
can play a major role in heating the quiet-Sun corona (McIntosh et al.
2011; Wedemeyer-Böhm et al. 2012), while for coronal active regions the
additional DC heating mechanism must play a role (Parker 1988; Klimchuk
2006).

To examine the relative roles of diverse physical mechanisms in the
context of coronal heating, it is essential to have information on the
coronal magnetic and velocity field. Current instrumentation is still at
a nascent stage, however, and is inadequate for such coronal diagnostics
(Lin, Kuhn & Coulter 2004). Since coronal field lines are linked to the
photosphere, another approach is possible: exploring the relationship
between photospheric magnetic-field parameters and brightness of the
coronal loops. In earlier studies, Fisher et al. (1998) and Tan et al.
(2007) investigated the relationship between the X-ray luminosity and
photospheric magnetic-field parameters. These two studies reported a
strong correlation between the X-ray luminosity and the total unsigned
magnetic flux. Tan et al. (2007) also found a good correlation between
the average X-ray brightness and average Poynting flux, but ruled out
any correlation between the velocity of footpoint motions and total
X-ray brightness. Their computed Poynting flux had a range between 10
@xmath and 10 @xmath ergs cm @xmath s @xmath , which is enough to heat
the corona (Withbroe & Noyes 1977). Using data from other wavelengths
(UV/EUV channels), Chandrasekhar et al. (2013) also found a good
correlation between total emission from bright points and total unsigned
photospheric magnetic flux. Forward-modeling of active regions also
suggests a direct correlation between magnetic flux and X-ray luminosity
(Lundquist et al. 2008).

The net current is a measure of non-potentiality of the magnetic field
in the active region. In active-region flare and coronal-mass-ejection
processes, the non-potentiality of the magnetic field can play a
significant role (Schrijver et al. 2006; Jing et al. 2006; Wang et al.
2008). As a result of the low resistivity, large-scale ( @xmath km)
currents cannot dissipate sufficiently in the corona (Hagyard 1988);
thus these currents may have no contribution to coronal heating. Earlier
observations do not find a strong relationship between the total X-ray
luminosity and total vertical current (Metcalf et al. 1994; Fisher et
al. 1998). Note that Wang et al. (2008) showed the existence of 3D
current structures over active regions. Another traditionally used
measure for magnetic non-potentiality is the parameter @xmath which
appears in the force-free field equation and which is thought to be
related to the wrapping of magnetic-field lines along the axis of an
active-region flux tube ( i.e. the twist of magnetic-field lines).
Observation shows that there is no significant correlation between X-ray
brightness and @xmath (Fisher et al. 1998; Nandy 2008). While many
studies have used @xmath as the measure of the twist in the solar active
region, this is questionable because the photosphere is not deemed to be
force-free (Leka et al. 2005). Other studies have shown that a
polarity-inversion line near coronal-loop foot points and strong
magnetic shear may also result in enhanced coronal emission (Falconer
1997; Falconer et al. 1997, 2000).

Longcope (1996) proposed the minimum current corona (MCC) model where
coronal heating was described as a series of small reconnection events
punctuating the quasi-static evolution of coronal field. This model
qualitatively predicts the variation of the X-ray luminosity with the
total flux that closely matches observations (Fisher et al. 1998). Wang
et al. (2000) have observed bright coronal loops and diffused coronal
loops that are associated with the quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs). Since
QSLs are the places where energy release occurs through 3D magnetic
reconnection, they concluded that QSLs are important for heating the
active-region corona and chromosphere. By analysing the X-ray images
taken from Hinode/X-Ray Telescope (XRT) and corresponding Michelson
Doppler Imager (MDI) line-of-sight magnetograms, Lee et al. (2010) found
a relationship between coronal-loop brightness and magnetic topologies
in AR 10963. They also found that frequent transient brightenings in
coronal loops are related to separators that have a large amount of free
energy.

Here we revisit the coronal-heating problem with space-based
vector-magnetogram data, which are free from atmospheric seeing effects,
which can produce cross talk between various Stokes parameters. Such
space-based magnetic field measurements have also reduced atmospheric
scattered light contribution. The obtained vector-field data are of very
high resolution, thereby reducing the effect of filling factor. In this
chapter, we use X-ray images taken from two filters (Ti-poly and thin
Al-poly) of the XRT telescope onboard the Hinode spacecraft and vector
magnetic-field measurements taken from the Spectro-Polarimeter (SP) of
Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) to study the relationship between the
X-ray brightness and magnetic-field parameters in active-region flux
systems. This study extends previous work that used lower resolution
Yohkoh data (Fisher et al. 1998). We also, incidentally, explore the
effect of the filter response (which is mainly affected by deposition of
unknown materials on CCD cameras) on the relationship between X-ray
brightness and magnetic-field parameters. In Section 6.2 we provide the
details of the data used in this study. In Section 6.3, we detail our
results. In Section 6.4, we discuss the implication of our results for
the heating of the solar corona.

### 6.2 Data Analysis

#### 6.2.1 Data Selection

The X-ray telescope (XRT: Golub et al. 2007) onboard the Hinode
spacecraft (Kosugi et al. 2007) takes images of the solar corona at a
spatial resolution of one arcsec per pixel using different filters. XRT
images are of the size 2k @xmath 2k pixel, which covers a 34 @xmath 34
square arcmin field of view (FOV) of the solar corona. XRT observes
coronal plasma emission in the temperature range @xmath , which is
realized by different X-ray filters, that have their own passband,
corresponding to different responses to plasma temperature. Within a few
months of the launch of the Hinode spacecraft, contaminating materials
were deposited on the CCD, which significantly impacted the filter
response, specifically for observations of longer wavelengths. Regular
CCD bakeouts were unable to completely remove this contamination. As the
effect of the contamination is mainly wavelength-dependent (the
long-wavelength observations are affected more strongly), the
observations from the thin Al-poly/Al-mesh filter are more heavily
affected than the other filters such as Ti-poly, and Be-med. For the
present study, we have used data taken from Ti-poly and the thin Al-poly
filter, which observe the solar coronal plasma at temperatures higher
than 2 MK and 0.5 MK, respectively. Therefore, we have a point of
comparison to establish whether filter degradation may play a role in
the inconsistencies of the results.
~   The Spectro-Polarimeter (SP: Ichimoto et al. 2008) is a separate
back-end instrument of the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT: Tsuneta et al.
2008) onboard the Hinode spacecraft. The SP provides Stokes signals with
high polarimetric accuracy in the 6301 and 6302 Å photospheric lines.
The primary product of the Stokes polarimeter are the Stokes- IQUV
profiles, which are suitable for deriving the vector magnetic field in
the photosphere. The spatial resolution along the slit direction is
0.295 @xmath pixel @xmath ; in the scanning direction it is 0.317 @xmath
pixel @xmath . The Stokes vector was inverted using the MERLIN code,
which is based on the Milne–Eddington inversion method. The inverted
data provide the field strength, inclination and azimuth along with the
Doppler velocity, continuum images, and many other parameters. The
processed data were obtained from the Community Spectropolarimetric
Analysis Center ( CSAC ). We corrected for the ambiguity in the
transverse component of the magnetic field using the minimum-energy
algorithm (Metcalf 1994; Leka et al. 2009). The resulting magnetic-field
vectors were transformed into heliographic co-ordinates (Venkatkrishnan
and Gary 1989). We selected 40 different NOAA active regions observed at
different times of the year. We also excluded active regions whose
central meridional distance was greater than @xmath . We took the vector
magnetogram data close to the timings of soft X-ray data obtained from
both the Ti-poly and the Al-poly filter of the XRT. In Table 6.1 and 6.2
we list the different active regions used in this study, the date and
time of the observations of the vector magnetogram, and the
corresponding soft X-ray data. After these two sets of data, we also
obtained the G-band data taken by the X-Ray Telescope . These data were
used for to co-align each of the data sets. For each selected vector
magnetogram, we simultaneously took XRT X-ray (Ti-poly and Al-poly) data
and G-band data. Throughout this chapter, we use the term Ti-poly
dataset to represent the X-ray image obtained from the Ti-poly filter of
XRT onboard Hinode . Similarly, we use the term Al-poly for the data
taken from the Al-poly filter. There is always a corresponding vector
magnetogram associated with these data sets. The X-ray data were
calibrated using the xrt @xmath prep.pro available in the Solarsoft
routines. The calibrated data were normalized to a one-second exposure
time.

#### 6.2.2 Data Coalignment

To overlay the XRT X-ray data with vector magnetograms, we first
co-aligned the G-band data taken by XRT telescope with the continuum
image. The continuum image was obtained by inverting the Stokes data
set. To do this, we first identified the dark center of the sunspot in
the G-band and continuum images. Later, we interpolated the continuum
image data to the XRT image resolution. In the next step, we choose the
same field of view (FOV) in the two data sets. By using the
maximum-correlation method, we then co-aligned the continuum images with
the G-band images. A similar shift was applied to the vector field data
to co-align the entire dataset with X-ray images of the XRT dataset.

### 6.3 Integrated Quantities

We derived various integrated quantities and compared them with the
X-ray brightness. We computed the individual as well as integrated
quantities such as total magnetic flux, and total magnetic energy etc
and compared them with the X-ray brightness. Below, we describe each of
these quantities.

#### 6.3.1 Active-Region Coronal X-Ray Brightness

The integrated X-ray brightness [Lx] was computed by summing the values
of each bright pixel in the image and then multiplying by the pixel
area. The bright pixels were selected by using the threshold values. We
found the rms value in the X-ray image and selected only those pixels
whose value were higher than the 1- @xmath level (the rms value) of the
image.

#### 6.3.2 Global Magnetic-Field Quantities

Since our selected active regions are close to the disk center, the
magnetic-field vectors are horizontal and vertical to the solar surface.
Using the @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath components, it is possible to
define the integrated quantities, which can be correlated with the X-ray
brightness to find the relationship between the two (for detailed
information about integrated quantities, see Fisher et al. 1998; Leka et
al. 2007). We selected pixels in @xmath , @xmath and @xmath whose values
are greater than the 1- @xmath level of these images. The following
integrated quantities were computed from magnetic field components:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here @xmath and @xmath represent the vertical and horizontal magnetic
field, @xmath is the vertical current density, and @xmath is the
effective area on the solar surface. Since the ratio of the vertical
current density and magnetic field is related to the handedness or
chirality (twist) of the underlying flux tube (Longcope et al. 1998), we
also introduced a quantity @xmath (ratio of unsigned total current and
unsigned total magnetic flux), which has the same units as the twist and
can thus be taken as a proxy for it. Highly twisted flux tubes are
strongly non-potential, and thus the quantity above is a measure of the
non-potentiality of active region flux systems.

We computed all of the magnetic quantities from the vector magnetogram
for all active regions. The average estimated errors of the magnetic
variables: @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath are 8 G, 45 mA, 64 G
@xmath , and 800 G @xmath .

### 6.4 Results

Figure 6.1 shows the contours of the @xmath -component of the magnetic
field overlaid on the X-ray image of active region NOAA 11093 after
co-aligning the images. The contour map shows that the X-ray brightness
in the corona overlying the umbral part of the sunspot is lower than
that of the loops emanating from the penumbral part of the active
region. The bright loops are associated with the plage regions as has
been observed before (Pallavicini et al. 1979). The loops are still not
fully resolved in the XRT images, but the cluster of loops clearly turn
in a clockwise direction. On the west side of the sunspot, the loop
structures are absent. At the same location in the photosphere,
large-scale plage structures are also absent. This may indicate that
large-scale plage regions are essential for the loops to appear in
X-rays. Thus we note that a visual spatial correlation exists between
the location of the plages and the bright loops in X-rays.

#### 6.4.1 Correlation Between Global Magnetic Field Quantities and
X-ray Brightness

We explored the relationship between total (area-integrated) magnetic
quantities and X-ray brightness in active regions. We used the XRT data
for 20 active regions each in the Ti-poly and Al-poly data sets (all
data are listed in Tables 6.1 and 6.2). We only selected those pixels
whose intensity values exceeded a 1- @xmath threshold in the X-ray and
magnetic images. Figure 6.2 shows the contour map of 1- @xmath level
threshold of X-ray brightness overlaid upon the X-ray image of Active
Region NOAA 11093. The 1- @xmath level threshold line of the contour map
clearly indicates the borders of the bright loops.

Figures 6.3 and 6.4 depict the relationship between the X-ray brightness
and total unsigned magnetic flux (top-left), @xmath (top-right), @xmath
(bottom-left), and unsigned @xmath (bottom-right) in logarithmic scale.
Figure 6.3 is for the data sets of Table 6.1, i.e. Ti-poly filter and
Figure 6.4 is for the data sets of Table 6.2, i.e. the Al-poly filter.
The coronal X-ray brightness and the global magnetic-field parameters in
both data sets are clearly correlated; although the correlation
coefficients are numerically somewhat different, they are qualitatively
similar (for quantitative correlation coefficients see Table 6.3).

Non-potential flux systems are known to be storehouses of free energy,
and it is often assumed that therefore, a coronal energy release in
X-rays should be positively correlated with measures of
non-potentiality. Figure 6.5 depicts the relationship between X-ray
brightness and the non-potentiality measure @xmath . The top plots are
for data sets of Table 6.1 (Ti-poly filter data), the bottom plots are
for data sets of Table 6.2 (Al-poly filter data). The X-ray brightness
is anti-correlated with @xmath in both cases.

To determine which of the magnetic quantities contributes predominantly
to the X-ray brightness, we need to examine whether there is any
inter-dependence between the global magnetic quantities. In subsection
6.4.2, we follow Fisher et al. (1998) in this analysis and establish the
correlation between each of the magnetic parameters with the total
unsigned flux first and also perform a partial correlation analysis to
extract the true underlying dependencies.

#### 6.4.2 Correlations Among Global Magnetic-Field Quantities and
Partial Correlation Analysis

Figure 6.6 (see also Table 6.3) shows the inter-dependence of the total
unsigned magnetic flux and all other magnetic variables, such as the
total absolute current, @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath . Each of these
magnetic parameters shows a good correlation with the total unsigned
magnetic flux, which means that they are related to each other through
size (area integration). To find the relationships between the different
magnetic parameters, we carried out a partial-correlation analysis. In
the partial-correlation technique, the correlation between the two
dependent variables is examined after removing the effects of other
variables.

Table 6.4 shows the partial correlation coefficients between the X-ray
brightness and integrated magnetic quantities (except for the magnetic
flux) after removing the effect of magnetic flux. Again, we find that
although the correlation coefficients are numerically somewhat
different, they are qualitatively similar across the two filters. We do
not find any significant correlation between X-ray brightness and other
magnetic quantities (except for a slightly negative correlation for
@xmath , which is lower for the Ti-poly filter). Thus, it appears that
the total magnetic flux is the primary positive contributor to the total
coronal X-ray flux over solar active regions.

#### 6.4.3 Filter Issues in the X-ray Data

Our analysis shows that there are minor differences in the established
relationships gleaned from the Ti-poly and Al-poly data sets. We suggest
that this small difference in results can be explained as a consequence
of contamination in CCDs that could have altered the filter response.
The Ti-poly X-ray data and Al-poly X-ray data have strong linear
correlation (linear correlation coefficient 0.99) which indicates that
there are no calibration problems with the XRT data (see Figure 6.7).
Taken together with the fact that the results are qualitatively similar
from both filters, this lends strong credence to the data and our
conclusions.

### 6.5 Summary and Discussion

A dominant fraction of coronal X-ray emission is known to originate
within strongly magnetized active-region structures. To establish which
of the magnetic-field quantities within these active regions contributes
to the observed X-ray brightness, we have analyzed the X-ray data from
the XRT instrument and vector magnetic field measurements from the SP
instrument onboard the Hinode spacecraft. We observed a good correlation
between the total area-integrated magnetic field parameters and the
X-ray brightness. A strong correlation is observed with the total
unsigned magnetic flux and closer inspection indicates that other
magnetic parameters are correlated with the X-ray brightness through
their dependence on magnetic flux. This establishes that the magnetic
flux (and thus size) of the system matters. It is generally observed
that larger active regions have higher magnetic flux than smaller active
regions, which suggests that larger active regions are brighter in
X-rays than the small active regions. This result reconfirms the earlier
result of Fisher et al. (1998), which was based on lower resolution data
and is valid across a range of orders of magnitudes across stars and
other astrophysical objects (Pevtsov et al. 2003).

A large amount of total current is indicative of a highly non-potential
active region with a large reservoir of energy. Does this larger energy
reserve due to non-potentiality directly translate into stronger coronal
X-ray emission?. Large-scale current systems are known to produce
large-scale flares (Schrijver et al. 2008). It has previously been shown
by Nandy et al. (2003) that the variance in the distribution of the
local twist within active-region flux systems is also an indicator of
the flare productivity of active regions. However, even if this
background is suggestive of the role of active region non-potentiality
in the release of energy and one might surmise also in coronal heating,
we did not find this to be the case here. In fact, we found a (weak)
negative correlation between X-ray flux and a measure of
non-potentiality, namely @xmath . If it does really exist, this
correlation has no obvious explanation (at least at this time). Previous
studies have shown that active-region non-potentiality has a stronger
correlation with flare productivity than magnetic flux (Song et al.
2006; Jing et al. 2006). On the other hand, we found a stronger
correlation between X-ray brightness and unsigned magnetic flux. Thus,
one can argue that while non-potentiality may be an important
determinant of localized heating related to flare productivity, the
total unsigned magnetic-flux content is the primary factor governing
large-scale coronal heating over the active regions.

For the Alfvén wave-heating model ( e.g. see the review by Aschwanden,
2004), magnetic flux is related to the power dissipated at the active
region through the square of the Alfvén velocity, whereas the X-ray
brightness would be some fraction of this power – which also indicates
that there should be a relationship between total X-ray brightness and
the total magnetic flux. However, based on a detailed analysis, Fisher
et al. (1998) showed that the energy in these waves is not sufficient to
explain the observed level of coronal heating. The MCC model (Longcope
1996) also predicts a strong correlation between total X-ray brightness
and total magnetic flux. On the other hand, in the nano-flare heating
model (Parker 1988) the power dissipated in active-region coronae is
related to @xmath , suggesting that the total X-ray brightness would be
strongly correlated with @xmath rather than @xmath .

Our observations and analysis suggest that the MCC model is a viable
contender as a physical theory for the heating of solar and stellar
coronae. Nevertheless, we note that it is very likely that a variety of
physical processes may contribute to coronal heating to different
extents; there are numerous other subtleties in the coronal-heating
problem that are far from being settled and need further investigations.

## Chapter 7 Kink Instability, Coronal Sigmoids and Solar Eruptive
Events

The scientific community is divided on whether the magnetohydrodynamic
kink instability mechanism in highly twisted sunspot magnetic structures
can generate solar storms such as flares and CMEs and form coronal
sigmoidal structures. To explore this issue we utilize high resolution
vector magnetograms from the Hinode satellite and a new observational
technique for measuring the twist of photospheric magnetic fields.
Following this, we perform a comparative study of a subset of solar
active region magnetic structures, associated flares and overlying
sigmoids or lack thereof, to determine whether the kink instability
mechanism can lead to coronal X-ray sigmoids and solar flares. We find
that on the rare occasions that the twist in magnetic structures exceed
the kink instability criterion, the active regions always had a flare
associated with them but not necessarily a coronal X-ray sigmoid. Our
results and analysis indicate that kink instability is a plausible
source for solar eruptive events and provides a viable methodology for
forecasting solar storms based on this mechanism.

### 7.1 Introduction

Solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CME) are explosive events
responsible for major disturbances in space weather. It has been well
established that solar flares are associated with sunspots and an
analysis of the magnetic structures of active regions (sunspots grouped
together) is necessary to shed more light on the origin of these solar
storms.

When a magnetic flux tube rises up through the convection zone it
acquires twist due to a variety of physical processes including helical
turbulence, differential rotation and the Coriolis force. When this
twisted flux tube emerges through the surface of the Sun – the
photosphere, the magnetic field expands rapidly as background gas
pressure decreases, and overlying coronal loops associated with this
active region are formed and observed in high energy radiation. The
emerged flux tube can be further twisted by shearing photospheric
motions such as foot-point motions and magnetic reconnection. The more a
flux tube and associated magnetic loop is twisted the more it deviates
from the potential field condition (i.e., a current free state) and
currents are developed in the system driving it to a higher energy
state. This stressed structure can release the excess energy in the form
of solar flares via magnetic reconnection (Parker 1957, 1963; Petschek
1964; Svestka 1976; Priest & Forbes 2000; Yokoyama et al. 2001; Takaso
et al. 2012; Su et al. 2013; Dudik et al. 2014). However, other
alternatives exists for triggering solar eruptive events.

Several observational studies have been performed to explore the
relationship between solar flares and non-potentiality of magnetic
fields. These studies find that non-potentiality of magnetic field is
closely linked with the release of solar flares (Tian et al. 2002, Hahn
et al. 2005; Falconer et al. 2008; Jing et al. 2010; Tiwari et al.
2010). One important parameter used to quantify magnetic
non-potentiality is magnetic helicity (which accounts for both twist and
writhe of an isolated flux tube). Theoretical considerations and
numerical simulations show that when the twist of a flux tube exceeds a
certain threshold, the flux tube becomes kink unstable and this
instability suddenly converts the twist of the flux tube to writhe or
axial deformation (Linton et al. 1996, 1999). Traditionally, the force
free parameter @xmath – calculated from the force-free field equation
@xmath – has been used as a measure of the twist of solar active
regions. The parameter @xmath is roughly equivalent to twice the
magnitude of the twist q . Several methods have been proposed to
calculate @xmath , e.g., @xmath (Pevtsov et al. 1995), @xmath (Hagino &
Sakurai 2004) and @xmath (Leka et al. 2005) from vector magnetograms.
The force free field equation arises from an assumption that the gas
pressure is significantly lesser than the magnetic pressure which holds
true in the corona. However the usage of the force free field equation
on vector magnetograms is questionable since the gas pressure in the
photosphere is comparable to the magnetic pressure (Metcalf et al.
1995). To take care of this Nandy et al. (in preparation) proposed a new
method for calculating the twist of photospheric magnetic structures,
namely the flux tube fitting technique method, which does not rely on
the force-free field assumption.

Leamon et al. (2002) utilized the force-free parameter @xmath in an
earlier comparative analysis in a subset of solar active regions to
emphatically state that kink instability does not play a role in solar
eruptions. However, Fan (2005) used MHD simulations to demonstrate that
a flux tubes can become kink unstable and erupt through the overlying
fields if the twist in the flux tube exceeds a certain value. Leka et
al. (2005) performed a blind test on a single magnetogram using the
@xmath method proposed in the same paper and suggested that kink
instability can be a possible trigger mechanism for solar flares. They
argued that the @xmath method underestimates the value of the twist by
an order of magnitude as it samples the whole active region structure.
However the @xmath method too suffers from a drawback – it takes only
the peak value of the spatial distribution of @xmath gleaned from one
pixel which makes it susceptible to errors.

In this chapter, we explicitly test the idea that kink unstable flux
tubes are prone to flaring using the twist calculation method suggested
by Nandy et al. (in preparation) which is free from the shortcomings
mentioned above. We provide details about the data used for our study in
Section 7.2. In Section 7.3, we briefly discuss the flux tube fitting
technique developed by Nandy et al. (in preparation) for calculating
best-fit twist and critical twist threshold for kink instability. In
Sections 7.4 and 7.5 we proceed to analyse several vector magnetograms
with the said method and present our results and conclusion.

### 7.2 Data Selection and Analysis

For this study we have used data from the spectro-polarimeter (Ichimoto
et al. 2008, SP) back-end instrument of the solar optical telescope
(Tsuneta et al. 2008; SOT) onboard the Hinode satellite. This instrument
measures the stokes signal for spectral lines Fe I 6301 and
6302 Å respectively. It scans the active region in fast scan mode with
spatial resolution @xmath pixel @xmath (along the slit direction) and
@xmath pixel @xmath (along the scanning direction) with a integration
time of 1.6 s. Physical magnetic parameters from stokes signal are
obtained by inverting the data sets using MERLIN code (based on
Milne-Eddington inversion method) and this inverted data sets are
available at the Community Spectro-Polarimeter Center (
http://sot.lmsal.com/data/sot/level2d and http://www.csac.hao.ucar.edu/
). The inherent @xmath ambiguity in the transverse field of the vector
magnetogram are resolved using the minimum energy algorithm (Metcalf
1994; Leka et al. 2009). Then the magnetic field vectors are transformed
into heliographic coordinates (Venkatkrishnan & Gary 1989).

For this study, we used 14 different NOAA active regions observed at
different times. To minimize the impact of projection effect on magnetic
parameter estimation we select active regions which lie within a central
meridional distance of 30 degrees from the disc center.

For this active region data set we subsequently determine whether they
had any associated flares or coronal X-ray sigmoids. Flare information,
including timing and class was taken from the NOAA Flare Catalogue and
sigmoidal data was provided by the Hinode X-Ray Telescope (XRT) Team
(see Savcheva et al. 2014). The resulting database of active regions is
detailed in Table 7.1.

### 7.3 Methods

#### 7.3.1 Measuring Twist by Cylindrical-Flux-Tube-Fitting Technique

To measure twist and the kink instability criterion self consistently
from vector magnetograms we follow the flux-tube-fitting technique
developed by Nandy et al. (in preparation). In this technique, they
assume that solar active regions form photospheric cross-sections of
vertical legs of cylindrical flux tubes. The magnetic field structure in
the flux tube when represented in cylindrical co-ordinates has three
components @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . Considering z-axis as the axis
of the flux tube, if we twist the flux tube by an amount q(r) then some
part of @xmath component is converted in to the azimuthal @xmath
component, and @xmath is given by @xmath (see Figure 7.1 for schematic
illustration). This implies that if a flux tube has no twist it will
have no @xmath component. Assuming flux tubes are uniformly twisted, we
can calculate the best fit twist @xmath following the equation @xmath .
To do this, we follow the series of steps described below.

We choose our substructure by manually selecting four pixels from a
vector magnetogram which form the edges of the rectangle which encloses
our region of interest. We assume that the umbral part of these
substructures form a coherent flux tube. To ensure that only the umbral
part of the substructures is used in our calculation, we select those
pixels whose transverse @xmath value lies above a certain critical
threshold value (1600 Gauss) ensuring that weak, outlying structures are
excluded. More often than not, the isolated coherent structure has a
circular cross-section that one expects to be associated with a
cylindrical flux tube. Once we have identified this coherent flux tube
we have to express the magnetic field structure in cylindrical
co-ordinates from the @xmath , @xmath and @xmath components in local
heliographic coordinate system. We use the flux-weighted-centroid (FWC)
as the origin of this local cylindrical co-ordinate system. To calculate
the position of the flux-weighted-centroid, we take the value of
vertical @xmath component in a pixel as the weighted flux of this pixel
(say @xmath ). The position of the flux-weighted-centroid is then given
by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where ( @xmath , @xmath ) is the position of flux-weighted centroid,
@xmath is the weighted flux in a pixel and @xmath , @xmath are the
coordinates of each pixel. After finding the origin of the cylindrical
flux tube, a coordinate transformation is performed to obtain the values
of magnetic field components in cylindrical coordinate system.

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

Determining the values, we finally plot @xmath versus r and evaluate the
best-fit (linear) slope which gives the best-fit twist of the identified
flux tube:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

Thus @xmath represents the average twist per unit length over the
identified flux tube. We note that @xmath is related to the twist
component of total helicity given by @xmath – where @xmath is the
magnetic flux and @xmath is the total twist of a flux tube of axial
length L ( @xmath ).

#### 7.3.2 Establishing the Kink Instability Criterion

To evaluate the critical twist threshold ( @xmath ) above which flux
tubes become kink unstable we utilize the theoretical foundations
outlined in Linton et al. (1999); this study, backed by numerical
simulations show that the twist threshold for kink instability is @xmath
, where @xmath is the @xmath coefficient in the Taylor series expansion
of the axial magnetic field profile of a cylindrical magnetic flux tube
expressed as:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here @xmath is the strength of magnetic field along the axis of the flux
tube. We plot @xmath versus radial distance (r), and perform a fit
corresponding to the above equation to determine the @xmath coefficient
thereby generating the critical twist threshold:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

If the flux tube twist @xmath exceeds @xmath the flux tube will be
susceptible to the kink instability mechanism.

### 7.4 Results

Table 7.1 lists 14 NOAA active regions obtained from the
spectro-polarimeter onboard Hinode. Active regions which contain single
or multiple loops and appear as either S or inverse S shaped in the soft
X-ray image of corona are known as sigmoids (Rust & Kumar 1996; McKenzie
& Canfield 1999). It has been shown by Canfield et al. (1999) that
active regions associated with sigmoids are more flare productive. Thus
we chose to include some active regions associated with sigmoid
structures in our study. For this work we first divided active regions
into coherent substructures (with a well-formed umbral part) and then
calculated @xmath and @xmath for all of these substructures at different
times depending on the availability of data. Note that @xmath and @xmath
are denoted as Q-fit and Q-kink inside the figures.

Fig. 7.2 is an image of AR 10930, which released an X-class flare. This
is a bipolar active region with both positive and negative spots. We
have studied the temporal evolution of @xmath and @xmath for active
region 10930 over a time period of three days. In the case of the
negative spot, @xmath never exceeds @xmath (see Fig. 7.3(a)); whereas in
case of the positive spot, @xmath consistently exceeds @xmath (see
Fig. 7.3(b)). We find no relation between the flare release time and the
time when @xmath is above the threshold value.

We note that positive and negative spots associated with the observed
vector magnetogram of an active region often have different values of
twist; this is thought to be because all magnetic field lines emanating
from one of the polarities do not necessarily close on the other spot
within the vector magnetogram. Some may connect to regions out of the
field of view of the magnetogram or converge on weaker regions which are
difficult to associate with the primary spots. In a previous study Inou
et al. (2011) utilized non-linear-force-free reconstruction to study AR
10930. They found that only a small isolated region of the flux system
had high twist exceeding a full turn and could not clearly establish
whether kink instability had a role to play in the flaring dynamics of
AR 10930. Clearly, statistical studies are important in this context,
whereby a larger sample of active regions and their analysis may
generate more compelling constraints. This motivates our study with a
larger sample of active regions.

From Fig. 7.4, we see that out of the analyzed 14 active regions, in
five cases @xmath exceeds @xmath at least one time. All of these 5
active regions had at the least C-class flares associated with them. In
case of other 9 active regions (where @xmath does not exceed @xmath ),
we find that five of them are associated with flares but the rest are
not. Our analysis suggests that if @xmath exceeds @xmath , the flux
structure is very likely to be associated with a flare but if @xmath
does not exceed @xmath , there may be or may not be a flare associated
with it depending on other factors.

In our study (see Fig. 7.5), 7 active regions were chosen which were
associated with sigmoids. The purpose of doing so was to investigate
whether the flux tube kinking has anything to do with it being of
sigmoidal shape. Out of the 7 sigmoids studied, in only three cases do
we find @xmath exceeding @xmath . As mentioned before these 3 active
regions were also associated with flares. For the 4 other sigmoids not
associated with flares, @xmath does not exceed @xmath . We conclude from
this that a high value of twist and kink unstable flux tubes does not
necessarily generate sigmoidal shaped flux loops in all cases.

Our study also shows that eight active regions which contain both
positive and negative spots (such as that depicted in Fig. 7.2) had
associated flares with them; indicating that complexity in active
regions makes them more flare prone.

### 7.5 Summary and Discussions

The scientific community has not been able to reach a consensus on
whether kink instability is a cause for releasing solar eruptive events.
Numerical flux tube simulations indicate kink instability as a possible
mechanism for triggering solar flares (Linton et al. 1996, 1999; Fan
2005). However one observational study – using the force-free parameter
@xmath as a measure of twist (Leamon et al. 2002) – claimed that kink
instability is not responsible for solar flares. But Leka et al. (2005)
showed that the calculation of @xmath for an entire active region is not
able to account for highly twisted sub-structures and the above
calculation is strongly influenced by horizontal field distribution.
Also, the @xmath assumption is only valid for a thin flux tube. The
proposed flux tube fitting technique for calculating twist does not rely
on the assumptions that the entire active region is uniformly twisted
and the flux tube is thin. Thus we believe this technique is a better
approach for calculating twist.

Here we have studied the susceptibility of active region flux tubes to
the kink instability mechanism using this new flux tube fitting
technique for calculating twist. Using this technique, we find that if
the best fit twist ( @xmath ) of any active region exceeds the threshold
necessary for kink instability a flare is always associated with this
active region. On the other hand, we also find some active regions where
best-fit twist does not exceed the kink instability threshold which had
flares associated with them. On another front, Rust & Kumar (1996)
suggested that sigmoids are kink unstable twisted flux tubes. We do not
find this to be the case. Within our seven sigmoid data set, we find
only three sigmoids had kink unstable (photospheric) flux tubes
associated with them.

In summary, we conclude that kink instability is the cause for at least
a subset of solar flares but the corresponding active regions need not
have coronal sigmoidal structures associated with them. This result and
the analysis outlined here may form the basis of forecasting solar
flares in advance when accurate vector magnetogram measurements are
available.

## Appendix A Numerical Methods

We provide a overview of numerical methods which is used to solve dynamo
equations in a two dimensional geometry. The evolution equation for the
poloidal and toroidal field is given by:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath . These two equations are coupled, nonlinear partial
differential equation. We solve these equations as a intial value
problem using Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method (Press et al.
1988). In this method, we write these equations in operator splitting
method:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath are the operators involving r-derivative;
similarly @xmath and @xmath are the operators involving @xmath
derivatives. @xmath and @xmath (rotational shear term) are the source
terms for the poloidal and toroidal field respectively. In our model,
@xmath i.e., source term for toroidal field and @xmath , i.e., source
term for poloidal field due to the Babcock-Leighton mechanism which is
modelled by double ring algorithm.

From equation (A.1), the operators @xmath and @xmath is given by:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here we describe the basic theme of Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI)
method in case of two dimensional system. In Alternating Direction
Implicit (ADI) method, each time step is divided into two half time
steps for two dimensional geometry. In the first half time step, one
direction (say r), is advanced implicitly then other direction (say
@xmath ) is advanced explicitly. In the second half step, @xmath
direction is advanced implicitly and r direction is advanced explicitly.
Let the value of A at grid point (i,j) at time step m is @xmath . Then
the ADI scheme consists of following two time steps:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here @xmath and @xmath represent the difference forms of the operators
@xmath and @xmath .
Here we treat the diffusion term by Crank-Nicholson scheme. We use an
first order accurate upwind scheme to treat the terms @xmath and @xmath
. The hyperbolic advective terms [ @xmath ] is handled by Lax-Wendroff
scheme, which is second order accurate in time and avoids mesh drifting,
large numerical dissipation.

Treating various terms in this way, we get the following forms of @xmath
and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

The matrix coefficients can be calculated with straight forward algebra
and take the form:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here @xmath and @xmath give the values of @xmath and @xmath at the grid
point (i,j).

Using (A.9) and (A.10), we can write the equation (A.7) in the form:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

where,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

Similarly in second step of ADI method, we can write the equation (A.8)
in the form:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

where,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (A.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

The coefficients of all these equations form a tridiagonal matrix.
Source term ( @xmath ) is treated explicitly in the code. In the first
half step of ADI method, we solve the equation (A.17) and get the values
of @xmath at all grid points. In the second half step, we solve the
equation (A.19), and get the values of @xmath at all grid points.

Similarly, we can solve the toroidal field evolution equation. In case
of the toroidal field evolution equation, For first half step of ADI
method,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

where,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

and for second half step of ADI method:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

where,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (A.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

The expression for the matrix coefficients necessary for the toroidal
field evolution equation are given by:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

where, @xmath .

We solve these equations in a @xmath grid with the appropriate initial
and boundary conditions.
