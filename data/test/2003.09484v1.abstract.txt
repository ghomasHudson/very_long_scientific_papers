Algorithmic methods for the explicit inversion of the indefinite double
covering maps are proposed. These are based on either the Givens
decomposition or the polar decomposition of the given matrix in the
proper, indefinite orthogonal group @xmath . As a by-product we
establish that the preimage in the covering group, of a positive matrix
in @xmath , can always be chosen to be itself positive definite.
Inversion amounts to solving a poynomial system. These methods solve
this system by either inspection, Groebner bases or by inverting the
associated Lie algebra isomorphism and computing certain exponentials
explicitly. The techniques are illustrated for @xmath .
