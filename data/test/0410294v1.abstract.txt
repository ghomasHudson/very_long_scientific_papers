Black holes, first found as solutions of Einsteinâ€™s General Relativity,
are important in astrophysics, since they result from the gravitational
collapse of a massive star or a cluster of stars, and in physics since
they reveal properties of the fundamental physics, such as thermodynamic
and quantum properties of gravitation.

In order to better understand the black hole physics we need exact
solutions that describe one or more black holes. In this thesis we study
exact solutions in three, four and higher dimensional spacetimes. The
study in 3-dimensions is important due to the simplification of the
problem, while the discussion in higher dimensions is essential due to
the fact that many theories indicate that extra dimensions exist in our
universe. In this thesis, in any of the dimensions mentioned above, we
study exact solutions with a single black hole and exact solutions that
describe a pair of uniformly accelerated black holes, with the
acceleration source being well identified. This later solutions are then
used to study in detail the quantum process of black hole pair creation
in an external field. We also compute the gravitational radiation
released during this pair creation process.
