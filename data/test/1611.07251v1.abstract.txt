It is the purpose of this thesis to enunciate and prove a collection of
explicit results in the theory of prime numbers.

First, the problem of primes in short intervals is considered. We
furnish an explicit result on the existence of primes between
consecutive cubes. To prove this, we first derive an explicit version of
the Riemannâ€“von Mangoldt explicit formula. We then assume the Riemann
hypothesis and improve on the known conditional explicit estimates for
primes in short intervals.

Using recent results on primes in arithmetic progressions, we prove two
new results in additive number theory. First, we prove that every
integer greater than two can be written as the sum of a prime and a
square-free number. We then work similarly to prove that every integer
greater than ten and not congruent to one modulo four can be written as
the sum of the square of a prime and a square-free number.

Finally, we provide new explicit results on an arcane inequality of
Ramanujan. We solve the inequality completely on the assumption of the
Riemann hypothesis.
