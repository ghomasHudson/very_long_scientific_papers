We consider different aspects of the virtual Compton amplitude in QCD on
two examples: small-x physics accessible in the Regge regime and twist-3
approximation in the description of DVCS through the general parton
distributions. Using this model, we give an estimate for the cross
section of deeply virtual Compton scattering for the kinematics of CEBAF
at Jefferson Lab.

Acknowledgments I am grateful to many people for their help and support
during all the years I have been a graduate student.

I would particularly like to thank my thesis advisor Ian Balitsky for
assigning me such a challenging and rewarding thesis project. I express
my deep gratitude to Professor Anatoly Radyushkin for his continuing
support during my graduate student career and for giving me many
opportunities to learn good physics.

It has been my privilege to collaborate with an amazing group of people,
the Theory group at Jefferson Lab, who are equal parts teachers,
scientists, and tireless workers. Igor Musatov, my colleague and friend,
provided invaluable help in nearly every project I worked on.

I would like to thank my family and friends for supporting me through
what has been a difficult road.

I thank my husband Sergey for his willingness to help and my mom for
keeping my children safe and sound for me, for their patience, permanent
spiritual support and encouragement.

I would also like to extend my gratitude to the members of my committee,
for taking time to read this manuscript and for their helpful comments
and suggestions.
