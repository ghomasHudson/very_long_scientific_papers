We show that Einstein’s gravitational field equations for the
Friedmann-Robertson-Lemaître-Walker (FRLW) and for two conformal
versions of the Bianchi I and Bianchi V perfect fluid scalar field
cosmological models, can be equivalently reformulated in terms of a
single equation of either generalized Ermakov-Milne-Pinney (EMP) or
(non)linear Schrödinger (NLS) type. This work generalizes or presents an
alternative to similar reformulations published by the authors who
inspired this thesis: R. Hawkins, J. Lidsey, T. Christodoulakis, T.
Grammenos, C. Helias, P. Kevrekidis, G. Papadopoulos and F. Williams. In
particular we cast much of these authors’ works into a single framework
via straightforward derivations of the EMP and NLS equations from a
simple linear combination of the relevant Einstein equations. By
rewriting the resulting expression in terms of the volume expansion
factor and performing a change of variables, we obtain an uncoupled EMP
or NLS equation that is independent of the imposition of additional
conservation equations. Since the correspondences shown here present an
alternative route for obtaining exact solutions to Einstein’s equations,
we reconstruct many known exact solutions via their EMP or NLS
counterparts and show by numerical analysis the stability properties of
many solutions.
