The present thesis, which is mainly based on my research papers I–IV
listed overleaf, is devoted to some forefront issues in the field of
leptogenesis. As well as nicely explaining the origin of the
matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe, this mechanism is
intimately related to the nature of neutrino masses in that it is the
cosmological consequence of the see-saw mechanism. This connection makes
possible to relate parameters measured or to be measured in neutrino
experiments to a cosmological parameter, the baryon-to-photon ratio,
@xmath .

According to the mass @xmath of the heavy neutrino that decays, the
generation of asymmetry has to be described by different sets of
classical Boltzmann equations: in the unflavored regime, when @xmath ,
the lepton flavors are summed over, and the asymmetry is estimated from
two equations, one of which tracks @xmath , the total @xmath number,
where @xmath and @xmath denote baryon and lepton numbers, respectively.
In the fully flavored regime, when @xmath , the lepton flavor
asymmetries @xmath or @xmath , must be tracked instead. The fact that
two descriptions coexist is due to the @xmath -lepton Yukawa
interactions, which become important roughly when the temperature in the
primordial plasma drops below @xmath . As we pointed out in paper III,
the transition between the two regimes requires a quantum kinetic
treatment, where correlations in flavor space and partial losses of
coherence are properly accounted for.

In the unflavored regime, when the heavy neutrino masses are
hierarchical, one typically obtains a scenario where only the
contribution from the lightest right-handed neutrino, @xmath , matters.
A lower bound on @xmath of about @xmath for successful leptogenesis can
then be derived. The associated lower bound on the reheat temperature
@xmath of the Universe after inflation being of the same order, a
tension arises between leptogenesis and supergravity theories because of
a possible overproduction of gravitinos. Furthermore, it is interesting
that one finds a stringent upper bound on the absolute neutrino mass
scale, @xmath . Finally, it should be noted that, in the unflavored
regime, the final asymmetry does not depend on the lepton mixing matrix,
which contains the potentially measurable Dirac and Majorana @xmath
-violating phases. The necessary source of @xmath violation is instead
provided by unmeasurable phases in the high-energy sector.

In the fully flavored regime, the lowest bounds on @xmath and on the
reheat temperature do not change, as we stressed in paper II. On the
other hand, the parameters accessible in neutrino experiments, notably
the angle @xmath and the Dirac and Majorana @xmath -violating phases,
acquire importance. According to the value they take, the predictions
from leptogenesis can differ by orders of magnitude, as we showed in
paper II. Moreover, as investigated in detail in paper IV, the source of
@xmath violation required for leptogenesis may be exclusively provided
by the Dirac phase, which is the low-energy phase with the best
prospects of being measured in the near future.

There are different ways to go beyond the “vanilla” picture where the
asymmetry is produced by the lightest right-handed neutrino and the
lower bounds introduced above hold. Following paper I, three
possibilities are discussed. First, a quasi-degenerate mass spectrum for
the heavy neutrinos is considered, implying that two or three heavy
neutrinos contribute to the generation of asymmetry. It is then possible
to relax the bounds on @xmath and @xmath to the TeV scale, and the upper
bound on @xmath can be evaded. Second, specific situations can be found
where the asymmetry is produced by the next-to-lightest right-handed
neutrino, @xmath . The lower bound on @xmath is then replaced by a lower
bound on @xmath , still implying a lower bound on @xmath similar to the
vanilla case. Finally, even within the @xmath -dominated scenario, a
special choice of high-energy parameters, which requires large
cancellations, can be chosen in order to relax the lower bounds on
@xmath and @xmath .

Leptogenesis has recently entered a new era in that some of what has
been discussed above has only been realized in the last couple of years.
Notably, let me mention the importance of flavor effects, the possible
relevance of quantum effects, as well as the role played by the
next-to-lightest right-handed neutrino.

In the future, the case for leptogenesis will be weakened or
strengthened depending on the outcome of the next-generation
neutrinoless double-beta decay searches, the planned long-baseline
neutrino experiments, as well as the LHC.
