In this thesis we study top-condensation models of electroweak symmetry breaking. In particular we investigate a scenario in which the CP symmetry is broken spontaneously due to the same condensates responsible of electroweak symmetry breaking. In this way a CP violating CKM matrix, gauge boson masses, and quark masses are dynamically generated. We started with a new four-fermion interaction such that it can be rewritten using two auxiliary fields. These fields become dynamical and play a similar role as the Higgs field in the SM but being now composite.
