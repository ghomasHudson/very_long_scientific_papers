We shall fix once and for all a number field @xmath and a quadratic
extension @xmath . We define our group over @xmath by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Let @xmath be a local completion of @xmath , either archimedean or
non-archimedean and let @xmath . Thus @xmath is either a quadratic
extension of @xmath or a sum of two copies of @xmath . Recall that we
have a double cover @xmath of the group @xmath . We begin by specifying
a section @xmath . This section defines a 2-cocycle @xmath corresponding
to the cover:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Our first results are an expression for @xmath in terms of quadratic
Hilbert symbols on @xmath . In the case that @xmath is a field
extension, our result completely describes @xmath . In the split case,
we obtain expressions which are valid on (a) the maximal torus and (b)
the subgroup @xmath . This will be enough for our purposes.
