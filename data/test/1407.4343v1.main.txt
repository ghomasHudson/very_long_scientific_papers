Acknowledgments

First and foremost, I acknowledge the contribution of my research group
not only to this thesis, but, more importantly, to science as practiced
in Brazil. As part of the Quantum Optics and Quantum Information Group,
I am able to do science at an international level and be a living
witness — and even proof! — against the notion that quality science can
only be done in fully developed countries. There sure still are
difficulties and limitations, especially regarding funding, but research
in Brazil has come a great way and my group is part of that effort. It
is particularly satisfying to watch conferences and talk to colleagues
from all over the world on an equal footing, be they from Toronto,
Hannover, Turku or Singapore.

I must thank my advisor, Prof. Ruynet L. de Matos Filho, who accepted me
as a student as I joined the group mid-Ph.D. During this time, Ruynet
has always been interested in working with me, proposing new ideas,
listening to me when I had results to show. A great part of the work on
this thesis was done during the weekly meetings at his office. He has a
very well defined notion of the responsibilities of advisor and advisee,
and does not shirk his share of duties. He has always been understanding
of my needs during this time, and helped me professionally whenever
necessary. I have always had a good measure of freedom when working with
him — with a matching demand in return! He has also seen to it that I
participate in conferences and meetings and had contact with scientists
of related areas from the whole world. I also thank my direct
collaborators Bruno M. Escher, who has often taken part in those
meetings at Ruynet’s office, and Prof. Luiz Davidovich, who has
contributed in ways I could not have understood before his
participation. The work here presented couldn’t have come to fruition
without them.

I thank my former advisor, Prof. Carlos Farina, with whom I had my
scientific initiation in the Casimir Effect Group. The three formative
years I spent working with the group were decisive for the scientist and
the person I have become. Farina is a human being with a deep sense of
the qualms of those around him, and an extremely rare ability to put
himself in the place of others. I have always felt the liberty to come
to him with my worries, including my wish to leave his group mid-Ph.D. I
thank him for not only being completely understanding of my move, but
also helpful towards it (all the while without giving up of me as a
student until I had completely made up my mind). Even though I have left
the group, I still feel attached to the people in it, and it is with
great joy that I see their ongoing success. I also thank Tarciro Mendes
who, along with Farina, was my first scientific collaborator, and Marcus
Venícius Cougo-Pinto, for teaching me a more formal approach to
mathematics — which has been directly helpful to this thesis — as well
as being an inspiration in terms of didactics, clarity and mathematical
rigor.

I thank my parents, Jayme and Angela, for not only accepting my choices
of studying first Chemistry, then Physics, but encouraging me to pursue
an academic career to the point of believing that anything else would be
nonsensical. I also thank my father for the corrections to the English
in this thesis. And I thank my elder brother, Paulo, with whom I have
had contact with interesting different perspectives on academic life.

I acknowledge the Physics Institute of the Federal University of Rio de
Janeiro (IF-UFRJ) for the very professional atmosphere that can be found
here. The commitment to doing science at a high level can be distinctly
seen in many of the research groups I have come in contact with. It is
an environment with an abnormal affluence of bright people, generation
after generation. This professional environment is also reflected in the
good work of Casé, Pedro and the administrative staff of the graduate
courses of IF-UFRJ as a whole.

I thank the funding agencies that have directly supported me, CNPq
(Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological
Development), Faperj (Foundation for Research Support of the State of
Rio de Janeiro) and INCT-IQ (Brazilian National Institute for Science
and Technology of Quantum Information), as well as sister agency CAPES,
which has also supported the group. E agradeço ao povo brasileiro, que
financia as instituições de apoio à pesquisa e permite que elas existam
¹ ¹ 1 Translation: “And I thank the Brazilian people, which finances the
research support institutions and allows them to exist.” .

I must nevertheless play a down note. It is saddening that the academic
career (worldwide) is so structured that the work one puts the most
effort into during their graduation ends up being read by a small amount
of people. In the writing of this thesis I have arduously striven to
reach out to more people but, as with anything in life, all the
dedication one can summon in an endeavor can only change the world by
the tiniest bit. If they get to be so lucky.

I now take the liberty to write the remainder of the acknowledgments in
Portuguese.

Agora em bom português, agradeço aos colegas do grupo de ótica e
informação quânticas. Ao Eduardo Paul e Alvaro Pimentel pelas conversas
que iam do jogo da velha quântico às utilizações da palavra “whose” em
inglês, e pelas várias vezes que entrei na sala de vocês para colocar
alguma ideia no quadro (de física ou não). Ao Wellison Bastos, logo na
sala em frente, pela paciência de me ouvir em muitos de meus anseios. À
Mariana Barros, minha companheira de viagens. E ao grupo como um todo,
mesmo quando vocês comem todo o churrasco antes de eu chegar.

Agradeço aos amigos que fiz na Física desde a época da graduação. Ao

## Introduction

How fast can a quantum system evolve to an orthogonal state? This
question serves as a starting point in the search for the quantum speed
limit, the maximal evolution speed of a quantum system. The goal of this
search is to obtain general bounds, valid for any particular system one
may wish to apply it to, limiting (from below) the time it takes for a
system to become distinguishable from its initial state. A paradigmatic
first answer to this problem, appearing in the seminal work of
Mandelstam and Tamm [ 2 ] , was that, given an evolution dictated by a
time-independent Hamiltonian @xmath and a pure initial state, the time
@xmath necessary for the final state to be orthogonal to the given
initial state is bounded by ² ² 2 We shall later see in Section The
Mandelstam-Tamm bound that Mandelstam and Tamm’s result in [ 2 ] is more
general than this.

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (1)
  -- -------- -- -----

where @xmath is the standard deviation of @xmath and @xmath is the
reduced Planck constant. A key feature of the above bound is the
dependence on the inverse of the standard deviation of the system
energy.

##### Why study such bounds?

The motivation for working on the quantum speed limit is fourfold. The
topic originally arose from discussions on the structure of quantum
mechanics, especially in attempts to define a suitable time operator and
derive an uncertainty relation for time and energy analogous to that for
position and momentum. The obtention of an uncertainty relation would
often guide and serve as basic test for posited definitions. We remark
that there has, in fact, been quite a lot of confusion regarding phrases
such as “time-energy uncertainty relation” and that we find the term
“uncertainty relation” unsuitable to refer to quantum speed limits such
as the above (see page Distinguishing between bounds and uncertainty
relations below for details).

The advances of computer science in its incessant search for faster
computation times brought along a practical applicability for the
quantum speed limit. While the evolution in computer processing power —
roughly exponential increase on clock rates observed since the 1960s,
although with restrictions [ 3 ] — has been dictated mostly by advances
in materials science, electronics (in particular, integrated circuitry
and the ubiquitous transistor) and computer architecture, there are
limits imposed solely by quantum mechanics [ 4 ] , irrespective of any
technological hurdle. Such limits are relevant even for classical
computation if it relies on quantum systems for storage or transfer of
information: in the (oversimplified) case of a spin-based memory which
only uses the pointer states up and down of a single spin to represent
bits 0 and 1 without implementing or taking advantage of any
superposition, computation times still depend on the time taken to flip
a spin, which is an evolution between orthogonal states of a quantum
system. (Dominant technology for hard-disk drives uses memory blocks
comprising many spins each as bits [ 5 , 6 ] , as well as promising
candidates for novel random-access memories [ 6 , 7 ] ). Naturally, the
quantum-mechanically imposed limits are particularly important for
quantum computing and quantum communication, which count on explicit
quantum properties (superposition, entanglement).

A third problem related to exceedingly short-timed evolutions is that of
the quantum-classical transition, i.e., understanding how, from a
quantum-mechanical substrate — which is experimentally demonstrated to
be a more general theory —, our human classical experience emerges. In
other words, the problem consists in finding out why our everyday
experience inhabits only a small fraction of quantum state space. The
most promising explanatory models [ 8 , 9 ] focus on the inevitable
interaction with the environment and the consequent selection of few
states and their classical mixture in exceedingly short time
(decoherence). Evolution times are therefore key to this explanation, as
quantum phenomena are not perceived on a macroscopic system due to the
short-livedness of its quantum properties.

Lastly, the control of the state and dynamics of a quantum system, which
has for quite some time received a great deal of interest for its
practical usefulness in fields as diverse as bond-selective chemistry
and quantum computation [ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 ] , has always had as a
concern the search for fast evolutions. A subset of the quantum control
program called quantum brachistochrone problem, which consists [ 66 ] in
finding the fastest evolution given initial and final states and some
restriction on the resources used and on the form of evolution allowed,
can be greatly aided by results on the quantum speed limit. We
nonetheless remark that the quantum speed limit and the brachistochrone,
albeit interconnected, are answers to different questions. The former
inquires how long it must take for a state in a given process to change
by some amount; the latter seeks to tailor a process (given some
restrictions) so that the evolution between chosen states is as fast as
possible. Their relatedness is depicted by a simple example, though: if
the only restriction to the evolution of a closed system is on its
energy, the brachistochrone (fastest path) is the one that saturates the
quantum speed limit.

##### Another relevant bound

Much work has taken the original bound further, but the most impacting
later result on the topic was the bound obtained by Margolus and Levitin
[ 44 ] ,

  -- -- -- -----
           (2)
  -- -- -- -----

where the time @xmath necessary for a state to become orthogonal is
bounded by the inverse of @xmath , the average energy with respect to
the ground state of the system. When discussing generalized forms of
these bounds, it is useful to characterize them as Mandelstam-Tamm-like
bounds when they depend on the energy variance and/or reduce to Eq. ( 1
) or as Margolus-Levitin-like bounds, when they depend on average
energies and/or reduce to Eq. ( 2 ). We note that Mandelstam-Tamm-like
bounds are founded on a more elaborate framework, with a clear physical
interpretation and with stances in which they are saturated along the
course of entire evolutions, whereas for Margolus-Levitin-bounds these
two features are absent (see Section Main features of the bounds for
more on the subject).

##### Distinguishing between bounds and uncertainty relations

There has been in fact much discussion on relations involving time and
energy since the dawn of quantum mechanics, and any informed reader
would be readily reminded by Eq.( 1 ) of the “time-energy uncertainty
relation”. We feel the need to clarify some distinctions among these
similar-looking equations to better precise the goal of our work.

Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation for canonical conjugate observables —
best known by the ubiquitous position-momentum case

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (3)
  -- -------- -- -----

but valid for any canonical pair — has had two main interpretations in
the literature. The first claims that the relation bounds the precision
of sequential measurements of position and momentum (or any canonical
pair) on a given particle. This was the spirit of the famous
Gedankenexperiment consisting of “looking at an electron through a
microscope” mentioned in the original article of 1927 [ 15 ] . However,
the most recurrent interpretation states that a particle cannot have, at
the same time , position- and momentum-distributions whose standard
deviations are below values allowed by the relation. In terms of
experiments, this view would translate into comparing the standard
deviations in position and momentum from measurements made on identical,
but different, ensembles. (As before, the argument goes for any
canonical pair.) Kennard [ 16 ] and Weyl [ 17 ] showed, shortly after,
that which later became a standard passage on textbooks on quantum
mechanics (e.g. [ 18 ] ): the commutation relation between canonical
pairs implies the uncertainty relation in the latter view.

If the topic seems controversial so far, it only turns worse when one
attempts to write time-energy relations such as

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (4)
  -- -------- -- -----

This happens for a few reasons, such as the lack of a satisfactory
definition of a time observable and the conceptual infeasibility of an
independent subsequent time measurement. One interpretation of this kind
of relation, posited by Bohr [ 19 ] and Landau and Peierls [ 20 ] , was
that an energy measurement made during a time @xmath would induce a
disturbance @xmath in the energy of the system according to Eq.( 4 ).
This disturbance would be relevant for subsequent measurements of the
energy, but not restrictive of the precision of the original
measurement. Fock and Krylov [ 21 ] , on the other hand, viewed Eq.( 4 )
as a relation between the precision of an energy measurement @xmath and
the time @xmath taken to perform it. These discrepant viewpoints
triggered a long, heated discussion in the literature, especially
between, but not restricted to, Fock on one side and Aharonov and Bohm
on the other [ 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 ] . The latter defended that the
relation did not hold in this sense, i.e., precise energy measurements
could be done arbitrarily fast, and further concluded that not even the
disturbance for later measuring the energy of the system occurred by
necessity: it was, in principle, possible to construct an energy
measurement on a system in which the only perturbations created were in
the energy of the interacting field/apparatus ³ ³ 3 This basically
amounts to stating the existence of quantum non-demolition (QND)
measurements. . Aharonov and Bohm’s point of view eventually gained
widespread acceptance [ 26 , 27 , 36 ] ; a review of this debate can be
found in [ 26 ] . The present work nevertheless does not undertake these
issues of relating time duration of an energy measurement to precision
of and/or disturbance caused by said measurement.

There were, however, efforts to obtain a time-energy inequality without
mention of measurements and describable directly by the state of the
system, akin to the more usual interpretation of Eq.( 3 ), by developing
a definition of a time observable in some sense canonically conjugate to
the Hamiltonian. This search for a time observable was unfruitful and
eventually abandoned, but this was the spirit in which the seminal
Mandelstam-Tamm bound arose: Eq.( 1 ) relates quantities of a given
state in a given evolution, without mention of any measurement.

Because the quantum speed limit, despite the notational resemblance, is
to be interpreted in ways radically different from the well-established
canonical-conjugate uncertainty relation (e.g. Eq. 3 ), given that
neither is Eq. ( 1 ) a consequence of a commutation relation (no
accepted definition of time operator) nor does it refer directly to
measurements, we refrain from calling it “uncertainty relation” and
favor terms such as “bound on evolution time” or simply “quantum speed
limit”.

##### Our contribution

Despite the interest in quantum speed limits for decades, very little
had been done [ 71 , 79 , 80 , 81 ] for open systems, described by
non-unitary evolutions, and even so, always dealing with particular
cases, not seeking general expressions. Jones and Kok [ 49 ] had even
argued the case of impossibility of a general bound for time evolutions
for the non-unitary case. Many of the applications of the bounds would
benefit from results for non-unitary evolutions, though. They would
allow one to assess noise effects on a system, which is crucial for
realistic descriptions of fast computation and communication channels;
the decoherence used to explain the quantum-classical transition is an
intrinsically non-unitary process; quantum control in general could be
improved if more evolution forms were available to choose from.

Our main original contribution to the topic comes in the form of a very
general bound for the time evolution of a state, valid for any physical
process, be it unitary or not, applicable for any time during the
evolution. It is derived geometrically and has a straightforward
geometrical interpretation; it is a Mandelstam-Tamm-like bound,
saturated under a simple and clear criterion. An additional result is a
second bound, dependent on the median of the energy distribution and
applicable for unitary cases, which could lead to a more general
Margolus-Levitin-like bound in the future.

This thesis is structured as follows: in Chapter Main concepts and
existing literature , we review previous results found in the literature
and define some of the notation. Chapter Quantum Speed Limits for
General Physical Processes is dedicated to present our main bound,
preceded by the concepts and definitions necessary to discuss it. We
also show our additional results. In Chapter Applying the bounds we
apply the bound to some examples, including some instances of the
brachistochrone problem, and final remarks and perspectives are left to
Chapter Final comments and perspectives .

In an effort to broaden the prospective readership of this thesis past
examination, we have striven to make it accessible to the reader not
knowledgeable on Quantum Information Theory, although Quantum Mechanics
is a prerequisite. The aim at a larger reach is also the motivation for
choosing to compose the present work in English.

## Main concepts and existing literature

In this Chapter, we introduce the main concepts of the topic of bounds
on quantum state evolution by reviewing the preceding works in the
literature. Although chronological order is largely respected, we are
ultimately guided by the presentation and development of the conceptual
framework necessary for our work, and by situating our work in the
literature ⁴ ⁴ 4 Comments on works subsequent to our own are left to
Appendix Later results in the literature . . More elaborate constructs,
such as the geometry of quantum states and the (quantum) Fisher
information, are left for the following Chapter.

We note that the question of how long a system must evolve for so that
initial and final states are orthogonal (or distinguishable to some
degree) must be undertaken in the Schrödinger picture, in which
evolution manifests itself fully in the state of the system. The
question as expressed above would be void — simply put, moot — in the
Heisenberg picture, since its evolution acts not on the state of the
system, but on its observables. The interaction picture is also
unsuitable for this discussion, for in this case the effect of evolution
is partly imparted to the state and partly to the observables. Because
we are comparing states at different times, orthogonality (and, later
on, fidelity) in each of these pictures is not equivalent, and should be
assessed in the Schrödinger picture in order for all the changes caused
by evolution to be reflected in the state. One could, in principle,
restate the problem in order to work in different frameworks — e.g.,
phrase it in terms of the orthogonality of supports of observables in
the Heisenberg picture —, but this will not concern us here. We work in
the Schrödinger picture throughout this thesis.

### The Mandelstam-Tamm bound

The first fundamental bound on evolution time was achieved by Mandelstam
and Tamm in their seminal work of 1945 [ 2 ] . In its most cited form,
it states that for an evolution governed by a time-independent
Hamiltonian @xmath to turn a state orthogonal, it must take time @xmath
obeying

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (5)
  -- -------- -- -----

where @xmath is the standard deviation of @xmath . We remark that the
numerical value of the bound depends on the Hamiltonian at hand as well
as on the initial state. This is a general feature of the quantum speed
limit: for each process (in this case defined by @xmath and the initial
state), a different value of @xmath may be obtained. That this must be
the case can be seen by two extreme scenarios: firstly, if the system is
initially in an energy eigenstate ( @xmath ), it will never reach an
orthogonal state, an aspect grasped by Eq.( 5 ) as it predicts @xmath .
On the other hand, with no constraint on the energy spread of a system,
its evolution can be arbitrarily fast. Such is the case of a spin-flip
under a field of arbitrarily high magnitude and, since the bound is
still valid, it must yield a correspondingly small time to reach an
orthogonal state. Because @xmath in a spin-flip is proportional to the
magnitude of the field, Eq. ( 5 ) correctly indicates a vanishing time.
Hence, only a process-dependent bound can produce relevant results. We
seize the opportunity to note that @xmath in the bound must be the
standard deviation of the full Hamiltonian governing the evolution,
which, in the case of a spin-flip, includes the applied field as well as
the spin Hamiltonian ⁵ ⁵ 5 A common misconception is that the bound can
do without the applied field. .

Mandelstam and Tamm’s result, however, encompasses more than just Eq. (
5 ), for it assesses not only orthogonality, but also how
distinguishable an evolved state can be from its initial state on a
gradual scale. The fidelity @xmath is a function that indicates how much
two states can be distinguished by measurements. @xmath is a
real-valued, symmetric function of two states which is null when they
are orthogonal (ideally distinguishable) and maximal (unity) when they
coincide. For two pure states, the fidelity @xmath between them is
simply the modulus squared of their overlap, so that @xmath . The
Mandelstam-Tamm bound asserts that, given an evolution generated by a
time-independent Hamiltonian @xmath and an initial state @xmath , the
fidelity between the latter and the evolved state at time @xmath ,
@xmath , is bounded by (from ⁶ ⁶ 6 In the original Russian version, it
corresponds to Eq. (9). Eq.(10) of [ 2 ] )

  -- -- -- -----
           (6)
  -- -- -- -----

for @xmath . The reader should note that, because of the time
independence of the Hamiltonian, @xmath is constant and can be
calculated on the initial or any other state along the evolution.
Relation ( 6 ) can be easily inverted to yield an explicit bound on the
time @xmath necessary for the system to reach some state @xmath such
that the fidelity relative to the initial state goes below a given value
@xmath :

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (7)
  -- -------- -- -----

where @xmath is defined to have @xmath as image throughout this thesis.
To illustrate the improvement on the previous result (Eq. 5 ), we notice
that, for an energy eigenstate ( @xmath ), Eq. ( 7 ) not only grants
that it fails to reach an orthogonal state, but exactly predicts that
the state does not evolve at all, since @xmath for any fidelity @xmath .
The term “Mandelstam-Tamm bound” nevertheless most commonly refers to
the special case of orthogonal states, Eq. ( 5 ), recovered by Eq. ( 7 )
with @xmath .

Perhaps the best way to interpret the fidelity-dependent bound is by
plotting the fidelity between initial and final states allowed by Eq. (
7 ) against time. This is done in Fig. 1 , where a simple application to
a qubit (two-level system) is presented, with a Hamiltonian proportional
to the Pauli operator @xmath , @xmath , and an initial state @xmath (
@xmath and @xmath being the @xmath eigenstates of @xmath , resp.).

The bound asserts that the fidelity between the initial state and the
state at time @xmath must always be above the dashed line. The actual
fidelity during evolution can be easily calculated in this example
(solid line), and it does obey the bound, as it must. In other words,
the bound affirms that the hatched area is beyond reach for the
evolution.

The relations above are valid for simple evolutions, i.e., pure states
evolving unitarily under a time-independent Hamiltonian. A proof of
Eq. ( 7 ) can be found on the very readable original article [ 2 ] ,
which we here reproduce; for the reader interested in an alternative
demonstration also founded on basic quantum mechanics, we recommend [ 28
] .

The original demonstration depends on two standard relations of quantum
mechanics. Firstly, for any pair of observables, the product of their
standard deviations is bounded by their commutator. We are interested in
the case in which one of the observables is the Hamiltonian @xmath
dictating the evolution,

  -- -- -- -----
           (8)
  -- -- -- -----

where @xmath is any observable of the system and @xmath , its standard
deviation. On the other hand, the type of evolution at play allows one
to write, for time-independent ⁷ ⁷ 7 Time independence in the
Schrödinger picture is meant, as mentioned on page Main concepts and
existing literature . @xmath ,

  -- -- -- -----
           (9)
  -- -- -- -----

where the averages are taken in the state @xmath at time @xmath . By
taking the modulus of the latter and comparing with the former, one
obtains

  -- -- -- ------
           (10)
  -- -- -- ------

Let us now choose @xmath to be the projection operator onto the initial
state, @xmath , @xmath . Then @xmath and from ( 10 ) one finds

  -- -- -- ------
           (11)
  -- -- -- ------

Upon integration with respect to time from @xmath to @xmath , one uses
the fact that @xmath for any @xmath and that the whole expression
depends on @xmath only via @xmath to arrive at

  -- -- -- ------
           (12)
  -- -- -- ------

where @xmath is the expectation value of the projector @xmath at time
@xmath , i.e., the modulus squared of the overlap, or fidelity, @xmath
(it should be clear that @xmath ). From this we recover ( 7 ).

Interestingly, Mandelstam and Tamm present two different bounds in [ 2 ]
. The one mentioned above, on a par with modern usages, is presented
only after a relation based on the possibility of inferring a change on
some given observable of the system. The authors define @xmath as the
minimum time necessary for the average value of an observable @xmath to
change by an amount equal to its standard deviation. Valid, as before,
for a pure-state evolution dictated by a time-independent Hamiltonian
@xmath , the bound (Eq.(5b) of [ 2 ] ) reads

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (13)
  -- -------- -- ------

Since this relation is valid for any observable @xmath of the system,
@xmath must be interpreted as the time necessary for the state of the
system to change, but this form does not lend itself easily to a
quantitative description of state evolution.

This relation can be demonstrated by integrating Eq. ( 10 ) over time
from @xmath to @xmath and applying again the relation @xmath , yielding

  -- -- -- ------
           (14)
  -- -- -- ------

where @xmath is the time average of @xmath over the integration region.
By definition, @xmath is the first value of @xmath for which the term in
parentheses in Eq.( 14 ) equals one (‘‘shortest time during which the
average value of a certain quantity is changed by an amount equal to the
standard [deviation] of this quantity’’ ⁸ ⁸ 8 Quote from [ 2 ] ). We
thus have derived Eq. ( 13 ). ⁹ ⁹ 9 Gray and Vogt have, for some reason,
recently shown formally which of the properties of the mathematical
structure of quantum mechanics are necessary and sufficient for this
inequality to be valid [ 29 ] . We remark that the standard assumption
of observables @xmath and @xmath being defined over the whole Hilbert
space is sufficient.

We note that the definition of time @xmath has also been taken as a
definition of a time operator [ 37 , 33 ]

  -- -- -- ------
           (15)
  -- -- -- ------

since, when applied to Eq. ( 10 ), it clearly leads to Eq. ( 13 ).

After Mandelstam and Tamm’s original paper, Bhattacharyya [ 30 ]
rederived and applied the bound of Eq. ( 5 ), whereas Fleming [ 31 ] ,
Bauer and Mello [ 32 ] , Gislason et al [ 33 ] , Uffink and Hilgevoord [
34 , 35 ] recognized that usual decays, not being unitary evolutions, do
not obey Eq. ( 5 ) and attempted definitions of time (inverse energy
widths, average lifetime, etc.) to tackle such cases. Eberly and Singh [
36 ] presented another time definition, being followed by Leubner and
Kiener [ 37 ] . All of these definitions, although occasionally valid
for more general cases than Eq. ( 5 ), had a strong heuristic character,
which undermined the relevance of their application: none has achieved
usage by the community.

More interesting are the results that take Eq. ( 5 ) further: Pfeifer
and Fröhlich [ 38 , 39 ] have generalized it for time-dependent
Hamiltonians. In the presented framework, this can be done
straightforwardly: Eqs.( 8 )-( 11 ) carry over for time-dependent
Hamiltonians @xmath (with their standard deviation being @xmath ), and
integration of Eq. ( 11 ) over time from @xmath to @xmath then yields

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (16)
  -- -------- -- ------

an implicit bound on the time @xmath necessary for the fidelity @xmath
between initial and final states to reach an amount @xmath . The bound
is particularly easy to apply if the Hamiltonian is self-commuting (i.e.
@xmath ), because @xmath can then be calculated as an average on the
initial state of the evolution (in fact, the result has been generalized
for non-self-commuting Hamiltonians only later, on geometrical grounds,
by Anandan and Aharonov [ 40 ] and then Uhlmann [ 42 ] ; later still by
Deffner and Lutz [ 43 ] ).

### The Margolus-Levitin bound

A different bound was obtained by Margolus and Levitin [ 44 ]
fifty-three years after Mandelstam and Tamm’s seminal paper. It is
independent — in the sense that it does not recover Eq. ( 5 ) in any way
— and relates the minimal time @xmath to reach an orthogonal state to
@xmath , the average energy of the system relative to the ground state:

  -- -- -- ------
           (17)
  -- -- -- ------

This bound is valid for pure states evolving under a time-independent
Hamiltonian @xmath . To demonstrate it, let us start by denoting by
@xmath the initial state, which can be decomposed in energy eigenstates
@xmath as @xmath (with @xmath ), and assume, without loss of generality,
a zero-energy ground state, such that @xmath . We are interested in
finding the first root of the overlap @xmath ,

  -- -- -- ------
           (18)
  -- -- -- ------

where the summations run through all energy eigenstates. By taking the
real part of the above,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (19)
  -- -------- -- ------

The derivation now makes use of a trigonometric inequality

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (20)
  -- -------- -- ------

where equality only holds for @xmath and @xmath . This choice of
inequality entails a certain degree of arbitrariness that prevents a
clear interpretation of the following result and is ground for
criticism, especially since no derivation so far has been able to do
without such an arbitrary choice. Substituting Eq. ( 20 ) with @xmath in
each term of ( 19 ), one finds

  -- -- -- ------
           (21)
  -- -- -- ------

If @xmath is a root of the overlap, or @xmath , both real and imaginary
parts of @xmath are null, leading to Eq. ( 17 ).

Unlike the Mandelstam-Tamm relations, the Margolus-Levitin bound in its
closed, analytic form only applies to orthogonal initial and final
states, and is unable to describe the system throughout its evolution.
Giovannetti et al [ 45 ] seeked to overcome this limitation and extend
the Margolus-Levitin bound to any fidelity between initial and final
states, i.e., to find a bound valid along the system evolution akin to
Eq. ( 7 ). They pursued a relation of the form

  -- -- -- ------
           (22)
  -- -- -- ------

bounding the time @xmath needed to reach a fidelity @xmath between
initial and final states, where @xmath , a function depending only on
@xmath , was to be found. The rather cumbersome following formula for
@xmath was obtained

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (23)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath and @xmath are parameters over which the expression has to
be optimized, and @xmath is an implicit function of @xmath defined by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (24)
  -- -------- -- ------

with @xmath . The authors resorted to numerical calculation for
estimation of @xmath . Readers interested in the demonstration are
referred to Appendix 1 of [ 45 ] .

### Main features of the bounds

A clear interpretation of the Mandelstam-Tamm bound has been enabled by
Anandan and Aharonov [ 40 , 41 ] , who developed a geometric approach to
the quantum speed limit, i.e., they rederived the Mandelstam-Tamm bound
on geometrical foundations. Succinctly stated, they have shown that
Eq. ( 16 ) can be interpreted as a comparison between the path followed
in state space in a certain evolution with the geodesic between the
endpoints of that evolution. Their approach will be discussed in greater
detail in Section Geometric Approach due to its importance to our main
result, also derived geometrically.

An additional sign of the relevance of the geometric approach is that it
presents a straightforward criterion for saturating the speed limit
(equality in Eq. 16 ), namely, that the evolution be along a geodesic.
Such finding paved the way for the first works, by Horesh and Mann [ 46
] and Pati [ 47 ] , on finding the states that reach the limit. The
necessary and sufficient condition is that the states be of the form

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (25)
  -- -------- -- ------

i.e., equiprobable, coherent superpositions of two energy eigenstates,
with @xmath . Saturation of the Mandelstam-Tamm bound is achieved along
the entire evolution for these states. Since geometric arguments are to
be developed only in Section Geometric Approach , we here present a
simplified proof of the saturation, limited to orthogonal states and
constant Hamiltonians, due to Levitin and Toffoli [ 48 ] .

This demonstration stems from a rederivation of the bound with the
mentioned restrictions, bearing some resemblance to the derivation in
Section The Margolus-Levitin bound . Being @xmath the decomposition of
the initial state into energy eigenstates, the fidelity can be written
as

  -- -- -- ------
           (26)
  -- -- -- ------

where the fact that the fidelity is real was used and summations are
over all energy eigenstates. Once again a (quite arbitrary)
trigonometric inequality is used,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (27)
  -- -------- -- ------

valid for any real @xmath ; equality occurs if and only if @xmath or
@xmath . By substituting this inequality in Eq. ( 26 ) for every term,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (28)
  -- -------- -- ------

Because @xmath is non-negative (and smooth), whenever @xmath , @xmath as
well, and orthogonality is only reached for a time @xmath if

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (29)
  -- -------- -- ------

which rederives the Mandelstam-Tamm bound. The condition for saturation
at @xmath is that of the trigonometric inequality for all @xmath . This
requires either @xmath or @xmath for every pair @xmath with nonzero
initial-state-expansion coefficients @xmath , which can only be
accomplished if @xmath is a superposition of no more than two
eigenstates. Simple calculations show that the only two-eigenstate
superpositions that reach an orthogonal state are the equiprobable ones
from Eq. ( 25 ), and it can be verified that their orthogonality time is
indeed @xmath . A more general demonstration based on geometrical
arguments will be found in Section Geometric Approach .

No clear interpretation such as that provided by geometrical arguments
has been bestowed on the Margolus-Levitin bound. Attempts to derive it
geometrically have been made [ 49 , 50 ] , but they have been unable to
recover Eq. ( 17 ) exactly. Furthermore, its saturation has only been
proven for reaching orthogonality (a single instant during evolution)
and occurs in evolutions along which the Mandelstam-Tamm bound saturates
at all times, with the same states given by Eq. ( 25 ). This has been
proven for the first time by Söderholm et al [ 51 ] ; we here reproduce
Levitin and Toffoli’s proof [ 48 ] , based on the derivation of the
Margolus-Levitin bound presented above. For equality to occur in Eq. (
21 ) at time @xmath , each term of the sum must correspond to equality
on the trigonometric relation Eq. ( 20 ). This implies, for every @xmath
such that @xmath , either @xmath or @xmath . The state that saturates
the bound must then only be composed of two energy eigenstates — one of
them being the ground state —, and, as before, only equiprobable
superpositions become orthogonal. It is easily verified that these
actually saturate the Margolus-Levitin bound. We remark that, although
the two demonstrations parallel one another in many senses, this is the
most comprehensive, definitive proof of saturation for the
Margolus-Levitin bound, whereas the above can be considered a quite
restricted proof of the Mandelstam-Tamm bound given the bulk of results
on the subject.

As for Giovannetti et al’s @xmath -based bound from page The
Margolus-Levitin bound , saturation of Eqs. ( 22 )-( 24 ) has only been
characterized numerically, happening at a single instant of time (at
most) for each evolution. Furthermore, no average-energy-based bound in
the form of Eq. ( 22 ) can be saturable along an evolution in the
neighborhood of the initial time (except for the trivial case of a
non-evolving state). This is due to the fact, granted by geometrical
considerations (see Section The most general quantum speed limit for
details), that the Mandelstam-Tamm bound is valid as an equality up to
second order in time, i.e., always saturates for sufficiently short
times (as illustrated in Fig. 1 ). For an average-energy-based bound to
saturate in such short times, it would have to equal the Mandelstam-Tamm
bound. Since the dependence of the two bounds Eqs. ( 7 ) and ( 22 ) on
@xmath is necessarily different (it is straightforward to test @xmath as
@xmath in Eq. ( 22 ) to verify it is unfit), they can only be equal when
@xmath and @xmath equal zero, i.e., the trivial case.

### Further results

The subject has amassed an impressive number of publications and the
above is by no means an exhaustive list of the previous works. A
frequently approached issue is how entanglement of a multipartite system
affects the speed of evolution, and it has been tackled with both bounds
[ 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 , 57 , 58 ] , with special interest on how
evolution speed scales with the amount @xmath of subsystems. For pure
states, it has been established that entanglement is a resource that is
able to speed up evolution: the time @xmath necessary for pure,
separable states to reach a given distinguishability scales no faster
than @xmath , whereas fully entangled states can reach a @xmath scaling.
This will be shown in detail in Section Dephasing and entanglement , but
we can advance the following argument: if a pure @xmath -partite state
begins and remains separable throughout evolution, its Hamiltonian can
(effectively) be written as a sum of local Hamiltonians, @xmath , each
@xmath acting only on subsystem @xmath . In this case, the energy
variance is additive, @xmath , which implies a scaling @xmath . Applying
to the Mandelstam-Tamm result, @xmath is bounded by a @xmath scaling for
separable states. On the other hand, a fully entangled initial state
@xmath evolves under a specific choice of local Hamiltonian with the
fidelity relative to the initial state being a function of the product
@xmath , so that it reaches a @xmath scaling and breaks the bound valid
to separable states. The actual demonstration is found in Section
Dephasing and entanglement .

The application of the bound to mixed states has received quite some
attention [ 42 , 45 , 52 , 55 , 57 , 43 , 58 ] . These works analyze how
a mixed initial state evolves under a possibly time-dependent
Hamiltonian, tackling unitary evolutions, unable to reduce the purity of
a state in any way — i.e., evolutions describing closed systems. This
approach can be useful for systems with a given constant degree of
mixture, but cannot describe processes actually responsible for mixing a
state. At first, the extension of the entanglement/speed-up relation to
mixed states were example-based approaches (chiefly on qubits) by
Giovannetti et al [ 53 ] , Borrás et al [ 55 ] , and Kupferman et al [
57 ] that verified entanglement speeding up evolution [ 53 , 55 ] , but
not in every case [ 57 ] . It was Fröwis [ 58 ] who demonstrated that
entanglement is a necessary condition to the speed-up of the unitary
evolution of an @xmath -qubit system: fully separable states are bounded
by a @xmath scaling, while entangled states can be faster, possibly
reaching @xmath . More details will be given in Section Dephasing and
entanglement after discussing the quantum Fisher information, a quantity
first brought to the topic of quantum speed limits by Uhlmann [ 42 ] and
instrumental to Fröwis’s result, as well as ours.

Moreover, there have been different inequalities based on higher moments
of the energy distribution [ 59 , 60 , 61 , 62 , 63 , 64 ] , as well as
other definitions of energy dispersion [ 65 ] . We also mention relevant
works [ 66 , 68 , 69 , 67 , 70 , 71 , 72 , 73 , 74 , 75 ] on the related
brachistochrone problem: given initial and final states, what
Hamiltonian drives the system the fastest? This is particularly
problematic on the so-called adiabatic paths, for which the usual route
requires slow driving [ 76 , 77 ] . The quantum speed limit has been
applied under that restriction in [ 78 ] .

### What had not been done

All of the aforementioned papers have in common that they are applicable
solely to unitary evolutions. In spite of the comprehensive literature
on the subject, very few contributions treat the more realistic, and
more general, non-unitary evolutions. As exceptions we mention Beretta [
79 ] , who derives a bound based on a nonequilibrium Massieu function,
the application of which to describe evolution is admittedly ad hoc;
Obada et al [ 80 ] , who obtain a speed limit for the specific case of a
Cooper-pair box interacting with a cavity field; and Brody et al [ 81 ]
, who briefly discuss speed of evolution in the context of a system with
gain or loss. Carlini et al in 2008 [ 71 ] interestingly treat the
brachistochrone problem searching for paths among unitary and
non-unitary evolutions.

The single publication in the literature preceding our work that does
discuss a general bound for non-unitary evolution is [ 49 ] by Jones and
Kok, who state that “there is no quantum speed limit for non-unitary
evolution”. However, their proof, based on a counterexample, is flawed
and cannot be used to ascertain such a conclusion. The counterexample
consists of a qubit, initially in a pure state, on which an interaction
is turned on, driving an evolution through mixed states until another
pure state, orthogonal to the initial one, is attained, point at which
the interaction is turned off. This is accomplished by applying gates
that entangle the initial, central qubit with @xmath other, “satellite”,
qubits. Before and after the interaction, the energy of the central
qubit is given by a Hamiltonian proportional to a Pauli operator, such
that initial and final states have the same energy average @xmath and
standard deviation @xmath . Disregarding the fact that the evolution in
between is not governed by this Hamiltonian, the authors expect
orthogonalization time to obey @xmath or @xmath , which can clearly be
violated if the interaction energies — not accounted for in @xmath and
@xmath --- are high ¹⁰ ¹⁰ 10 This is particularly blatant considering
the authors of [ 49 ] disregard a coupling Hamiltonian, applied to the
central qubit @xmath times, whose coupling constant @xmath must be
@xmath for there to be a violation. . Although the evolution of the
central qubit is indeed non-unitary, the fallacy is reminiscent of a
misconception mentioned in the beginning of this Chapter, page 5 , when
discussing unitary evolutions: even when initial and final energies only
depend on a simpler Hamiltonian, if during evolution some field is
applied, this field must be taken into account for the speed limit,
since it can, naturally, speed up evolution. The dependence on @xmath
along evolution in Eq. ( 16 ) is also due to that factor. The bound we
present, valid for non-unitary evolutions, also indirectly refutes their
finding.

After our work had been developed, there have been other publications on
bounds for non-unitary evolutions. These are discussed in Appendix Later
results in the literature .

In the next Chapter, we present our main bound (Section The most general
quantum speed limit ) preceded by important notions leading to it: a
short review of necessary quantum information results in Section Useful
quantum information tools , the geometry of quantum state space in
Section Geometric Approach , the (quantum) Fisher information in Section
Fisher information . Additional bounds obtained are introduced in
Section Additional results . Application of the bounds is left to
Chapter Applying the bounds .

## Quantum Speed Limits for General Physical Processes

This is the Chapter in which we present our main results. We begin by
considerations on relevant theoretical foundations: some aspects of
quantum information theory are shown in Section Useful quantum
information tools , the geometry of quantum state space in Section
Geometric Approach , and the (quantum) Fisher information in Section
Fisher information . Our most important bound is presented in Section
The most general quantum speed limit , product of a work done in
collaboration with B.M. Escher, L. Davidovich, and R.L. de Matos Filho
and has led to the publication [ 82 ] . Additional results are presented
in Section Additional results . Applications of the results are left to
the next Chapter.

### Useful quantum information tools

We begin by briefly reviewing some quantum-informational concepts that
will be used throughout this Chapter. We will present the Bures fidelity
of mixed states; discuss the purification, an important tool for dealing
with open-system evolution; and make a comment on POVMs and quantum
measurement theory. The contents of this Section can be found in most
textbooks on quantum information theory, such as [ 89 ] , and the reader
knowledgeable in quantum information may feel free to skip ahead to the
next Section.

#### The Bures Fidelity

Evolutions of open systems are (in general) non-unitary, and the
applicability of our main result to non-unitary evolutions is
instrumental to its relevance. Since non-unitary evolutions turn pure
states into mixtures, a first prerequisite is a definition of fidelity
for mixed states. In the previous Chapter, the fidelity was only defined
for pure states by their overlap, so that @xmath . For (possibly) mixed
states, described by density operators @xmath and @xmath , we use the
Bures fidelity, defined ¹¹ ¹¹ 11 In the literature @xmath is sometimes
defined as the trace, instead of the trace squared as we use. This is a
matter of convention; we prefer the form used in Eq. ( 30 ), which
allows @xmath to be interpreted as a probability. as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (30)
  -- -------- -- ------

The square root of a positive operator is an operator with the same
eigenvectors, but taking the square root of the corresponding
eigenvalues. The Bures fidelity obeys the desired properties for a
fidelity: i) @xmath is symmetric in @xmath and @xmath , although this is
not trivial to show; ii) if @xmath and @xmath are orthogonal (i.e., have
orthogonal supports, or @xmath ), then @xmath ; iii) if @xmath and
@xmath coincide, @xmath ; iv) for any states @xmath and @xmath , @xmath
. Moreover, Eq. ( 30 ) recovers, for pure states @xmath , @xmath , the
previous definition of fidelity, @xmath . We will see further motivation
for this definition later in this Section.

#### Purifications

A very useful tool in quantum information to describe mixed states is
the concept of purification [ 89 , 90 ] . Given a state @xmath of a
system @xmath , it is always possible to find a pure state @xmath
pertaining to a larger system composed of @xmath and an auxiliary system
@xmath such that @xmath . In this case, @xmath is said to be a
purification of @xmath . The auxiliary system @xmath is called an
environment of @xmath . All the information relative to the state @xmath
of @xmath is included in its purification, i.e., @xmath allows for a
full description of @xmath .

Although inspired by physical environments, we emphasize that
purifications are, first and foremost, a theoretical construct. In other
words, @xmath is a fictitious system that need not have any direct
physical significance: we will not be interested in an accurate
description of a physical environment. For a given state @xmath of
@xmath , there are infinitely many valid ways to purify it, and our
choice of purification is guided by how to describe the system @xmath to
the best of our interest, disregarding the actual physical state of
@xmath (often favoring simplicity and low dimensionality).

An important reason for the adoption of the Bures fidelity can be
understood by purifications. Given two states @xmath and @xmath , the
fidelity @xmath is the maximal fidelity between their respective
purifications @xmath and @xmath , where the maximum is taken over the
different purifications possible for each of the states. This result is
comprised in Uhlmann’s theorem [ 91 ] , which further guarantees the
existence of purifications reaching @xmath and also that maximization
only needs to be performed over the purifications of one of the states,
using a fixed arbitrary purification for the other. In mathematical
form, Uhlmann’s theorem reads

  -- -- -- ------
           (31)
  -- -- -- ------

where @xmath is an arbitrary purification of @xmath , and the maximum is
taken over purifications @xmath of @xmath . In fact, the maximization
does not even need to be performed over all purifications of @xmath ,
but can be restricted to auxiliary systems @xmath with the same
dimension as @xmath . Besides in the original paper [ 91 ] ,
demonstrations of this theorem can be found in [ 89 , 92 ] .

Purifications can be used to describe non-unitary evolutions of quantum
states. Given a state @xmath of system @xmath which evolves
non-unitarily, there are purifications @xmath for every time @xmath .
The evolution of @xmath is unitary (for the state is always pure), and
can be described by a unitary operator @xmath . Since a purification in
@xmath conveys a complete description of the state of system @xmath ,
the unitary operator @xmath fully characterizes the non-unitary
evolution of @xmath . There are various other ways to describe
non-unitary evolutions, such as Kraus operators [ 90 ] , Lindblad
equations [ 89 , 90 ] or master equations [ 93 ] , but because of the
further importance of purification to our results, we explicitly make
use of such unitary operators. We note that this approach of a unitary
evolution of a larger system can be used to derive all three
aforementioned non-unitary-evolution frameworks.

#### POVMs

Quantum theory not only entails the dynamics of a system, but also its
measurement possibilities. It is a standard postulate of the Copenhagen
interpretation of quantum mechanics (e.g. [ 18 ] ) that, whereas
physical observables are represented by operators @xmath on the Hilbert
space, measurements on a quantum state @xmath are represented by
projection operators @xmath . This is to be understood in the sense that
i) any measured quantity will be one of the eigenvalues @xmath of the
observable @xmath with corresponding eigenstate given by @xmath , ii)
the state is projected onto @xmath by the measurement and iii) the
probability of finding this measurement outcome is given by @xmath .
Each such measurement corresponds to a set @xmath of projectors onto the
eigenstates of @xmath ; the Hermiticity of observable @xmath implies
that this set is composed of orthogonal projection operators.

This type of measurement, called projective or von Neumann measurement,
is nevertheless not the only possible kind. In quantum information, it
is useful to deal with a more general set, that of the so-called
positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) [ 89 ] . A POVM is composed of
elements @xmath , each corresponding to a measurement outcome @xmath
whose occurrence probability is given by @xmath . A POVM is a set @xmath
meeting two defining properties: i) each @xmath is a positive operator
and ii) the set obeys a completeness relation of the form @xmath . The
simplest examples of POVMs are, in fact, complete sets of orthogonal
projectors, but the fact that the @xmath need not be orthogonal can be
used to one’s advantage. Suppose [ 89 ] one is sent a system in one of
two non-orthogonal pure states @xmath and @xmath (with @xmath orthogonal
to @xmath ) and has to find out which of the two was received. No
measurement can perfectly distinguish the two, but the following POVM
has an interesting property:

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (32a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (32b)
     @xmath   @xmath      (32c)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

This measurement has the benefit of never misidentifying one of the
states: the outcome @xmath cannot occur if the state was @xmath , so it
guarantees that the system was in @xmath , and vice-versa for outcome
@xmath . There is, however, a chance of obtaining the inconclusive
outcome @xmath ; this is inevitable, since the two states are not
perfectly distinguishable. In any case, employing a POVM is beneficial
because it produced reliable results for both states, something
orthogonal projectors are unable to achieve.

POVMs, and not orthogonal projectors, are as general as measurements can
be according to the postulates of quantum mechanics. But the latter are,
in a sense, “general enough” for their purpose. Any measurement on a
quantum system @xmath can be expressed as the combination of a unitary
operation and a von Neumann measurement acting on a larger system
composed of @xmath and an ancilla @xmath (which can be thought of as an
environment, or as the measuring apparatus). Since the other postulates
of quantum mechanics provide the structure necessary for unitary
operations and composite systems, every quantum measurement can in
principle be understood from the von Neumann perspective ¹² ¹² 12 This
seems to justify presenting only this kind of measurement as a
postulate, but in reality seldom are actual measurements described with
the cumbersome addition of an ancilla. In practice, most measurements
are not intended to tell non-orthogonal states apart. Without (need of)
such a precise distinction, which is made mostly in quantum information,
there is little use for non-orthogonal POVMs. . In Section The quantum
Fisher information , we will be interested in comparing measurements on
a given system @xmath . We will need to span all possible outcomes and
probability distributions, a task for which we must use the fully
general POVMs.

We end this Section by mentioning that POVMs allow for an additional way
of writing the Bures fidelity, namely

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (33)
  -- -------- -- ------

where the minimum is taken over all possible POVMs, and @xmath is the
probability of outcome @xmath occurring with the system in state @xmath
(respectively for @xmath ). This can be demonstrated by obtaining a
lower bound on @xmath using the polar decomposition of @xmath [ 89 ,
p.412] .

### Geometric Approach

Geometric approaches have greatly contributed to the quantum speed
limit, especially by providing a clear interpretation of the bound and a
straightforward criterion for its saturation. We first introduce and
discuss key aspects of the geometry of Hilbert spaces. This introduction
is by no means exhaustive and is rather intended to show the reader
knowledgeable in quantum mechanics how a (useful) geometric structure
can be built from the space of quantum states. Although no mathematical
rigor is lacking in the presented results, demonstrations thereof
expressible in familiar quantum-mechanical terms will be favored over
more mathematically rigorous versions, which will be referenced along
the way. We summarize the main results at the end of the Section.

#### A distance for pure quantum states

Any geometric structure of a set is related to the definition of a
distance in this set. A distance is a function of two elements of the
set, say, @xmath and @xmath , and yields a real number @xmath . The
three defining properties of a distance function are that, for any
elements @xmath , @xmath , @xmath of the set,

  -- -- -------- -- -------
                    
        @xmath      (34a)
        @xmath      (34b)
        @xmath      (34c)
  -- -- -------- -- -------

The first, seemingly innocuous, property has an important consequence to
applications to quantum mechanics. Since two vectors of a Hilbert space
which are proportional to each other represent the exact same quantum
state, we demand a physically meaningful distance function to be null
when comparing collinear states, say, @xmath and @xmath . But property
i) above requires that any distance rigorously defined in the Hilbert
vector space distinguish @xmath from @xmath .

##### The projective Hilbert space and its metric

The best way to circumvent that impediment is to work on the so-called
projective Hilbert space . A projective space is obtained from a vector
space @xmath by identifying vectors which only differ by a nonzero
prefactor. The definition of projective space also specifically excludes
the null vector. The projective space of three-dimensional flat space
can be thought of as the set of straight lines through the origin. Yet
another depiction is a unit sphere in which pairs of antipodal points
are identified, since each such pair defines the direction of a straight
line through the origin. More formally, the projective space is defined
as the set of equivalent classes of @xmath by the relation @xmath ,
where @xmath for vectors @xmath and @xmath . We note that a projective
space is typically not a vector space.

When @xmath is the Hilbert space of quantum states, the projective
Hilbert space is obtained. It is a set which does not distinguish @xmath
from @xmath and does not include the null vector in any form. It is also
called the set of “rays” of the vector space (in analogy with the
straight-line depiction of the projective space), and the common
statement that quantum states are given by vectors on the unit sphere
coincides with the aforementioned unit-sphere image of the projective
space.

Readers familiarized with the Bloch sphere should beware that there is
limited analogy between this unit-sphere image of state space and the
Bloch sphere, since in the former antipodal points represent the same
state and orthogonal states are given by perpendicular rays. Most
importantly, vectors within the unit sphere are simply non-normalized
pure states , not related to mixed states in any way. (Mixed states also
obey a form of normalization, @xmath , and hence would still be on the
unit sphere in this unit-sphere representation.)

The definition of the projective space is extremely suitable to quantum
mechanics, which does not physically distinguish collinear vectors and
assigns no state to the null vector. This is why it has been pointed out
[ 83 ] that quantum mechanics is actually described not by the Hilbert
space, but by its projective space. Naturally, we still say that quantum
mechanics is based on a Hilbert space — without which we would not be
able to talk, e.g., about the dimension of the state space —, but we
recognize that a mathematically more rigorous statement points to the
projective Hilbert space as the set of quantum states.

Just as there is a well-known homomorphism between the Hilbert vector
space of dimension @xmath and @xmath , the set of @xmath -tuples
composed of complex entries (usually depicted as column vectors), the
projective Hilbert space of quantum states is homomorphic to @xmath ,
called the projective complex space , obtained from @xmath by the same
procedure described above. This can be very helpful because results on
our projective space of quantum states can be attained by carrying over
results from @xmath , on which the mathematical literature has worked on
more profusely [ 84 , Vol II, pp.133, 159, 273] .

We are interested in Riemannian distances, which, in short, can be
obtained from the integration of a differential defined by the
Riemannian metric. A metric can be described by a differential form
@xmath , which indicates how the distance between neighboring points is
to be measured (the most usual example of Riemannian metric is that of
Euclidean space @xmath ). Integration of @xmath along any path will
yield a length @xmath particular to the chosen path. A Riemannian
distance between two elements is the length of the shortest path between
them, i.e., the minimum of the length over all paths connecting the
elements at hand. This distance is a function only of the two endpoint
elements, not of any path between them, and always obeys the properties
given in Eq. ( 34 ). We remark that this has been an oversimplified
characterization and that there are additional assumptions to the
establishment of a Riemannian metric; the interested reader is referred
to [ 84 , Chap IV] for a more complete introduction.

We then need to define a metric valid on the projective Hilbert space.
More mathematical treatments achieve this [ 84 , Vol II, p.159] directly
on @xmath by way of general theorems on complex manifolds; we prefer to
start from the Hilbert vector space to build a definition befitting the
projective space (this is a deliberate choice, there are authors who
avoid the projective space almost completely, e.g. [ 85 ] ). In the
vector space, a differential can be readily constructed with the usual
norm. Let @xmath be the infinitesimal variation of state @xmath , that
is, for some parameter @xmath on which the state depends, @xmath . A
simple metric is then given by

  -- -- -- ------
           (35)
  -- -- -- ------

The integral @xmath along a path in the vector space defines a length,
from which a distance can be obtained. Nevertheless, @xmath is
unsuitable for our purposes, since it would assign a nonzero length to
paths such as @xmath , @xmath , and eventually a nonzero distance
between parallel states such as @xmath and @xmath . In other words,
@xmath is a metric on the vector space, not on the projective space.

We therefore need a differential form that does not distinguish
collinear vectors. It can be constructed by subtracting from @xmath its
projection on @xmath ,

  -- -- -- ------
           (36)
  -- -- -- ------

where the fraction above is a normalized projector on @xmath . Note that
@xmath is not assumed to be normalized, we instead require that our
distance does not distinguish between states differing only by
normalization (or phase). It is in fact straightforward to see that
collinear variations of @xmath , of the form @xmath for complex @xmath ,
yield zero when applied above to any @xmath . As notation suggests,
@xmath is the component of @xmath orthogonal to @xmath . The “angular
variation” of @xmath is defined as

  -- -- -- ------
           (37)
  -- -- -- ------

where an overall normalization factor has been included so that @xmath
be a measure of changes on the projective space. The form @xmath ,
orthogonal to @xmath , can be seen as a circle arc; the extra factor
turns it into an angle, in line with the image of the projective space
as the set of straight lines (which can be fully characterized by
angular components). The need for that extra factor can also be seen by
the following example using orthogonal vectors @xmath and @xmath . Let
us perform the same variation on vectors @xmath and @xmath , which only
differ by a prefactor. Say the variation is to add @xmath . It is clear
that @xmath is quite different from @xmath , corresponding to different
elements of the projective space (equivalently, they correspond to
different straight lines). The prefactor added to ( 37 ) bears the fact
that the greater the modulus of a vector, the smaller its variation by
an addition.

The differential form of the distance is given directly by the norm of
@xmath ,

  -- -- -- ------
           (38)
  -- -- -- ------

where the subscript @xmath denotes that this is the Fubini-Study metric
, developed independently by Fubini [ 86 ] and Study [ 87 ] . It can
already be seen that this metric is invariant by any unitary @xmath
applied to both @xmath and @xmath . We remark that, although written in
terms of vectors, @xmath can only be a distance in the projective space,
not on the vector space itself.

##### Integrating @xmath

We now need to integrate @xmath to obtain the finite distance between
two states. This has been done for @xmath in [ 84 ] . Instead of simply
carrying over the result, we feel it is instructive to perform the
integration and minimization here to explicitly show that, by
construction, we do not need to assume any normalization or phase. We do
make use of the fact that the geodesic calculated in [ 84 , p.277] lies
entirely in a two-dimensional subspace of the vector space. This
bidimensionality can be motivated by the analogy with a unit sphere,
whose geodesics — great circles — lie in a plane containing the origin [
85 ] . Barring the trivial case where initial and final states are
collinear, it should be clear that the subspace in question is that
spanned by initial and final states.

Let @xmath , @xmath denote the initial and final states, respectively,
and let @xmath be a state orthogonal to @xmath such that the final state
is spanned by @xmath (a Gram-Schmidt procedure can always produce a
suitable @xmath ). Since the integration path belongs to the
two-dimensional space spanned by @xmath or, equivalently, spanned by
@xmath , we can write the state of the system along evolution as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (39)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is a real parameter (not necessarily time), @xmath , @xmath
are complex functions of @xmath , and no normalization is required from
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath or @xmath . We demand @xmath and @xmath , such
that the initial state of the system be identified with @xmath . (Since
we only require @xmath , it is not even necessary that @xmath .) The
finite distance @xmath is obtained by inserting Eq. ( 39 ) into Eq. ( 38
), integrating @xmath to obtain a length @xmath and then finding the
path (i.e., @xmath and @xmath ) that minimizes this length. These steps
are performed in Appendix Integration of the Fubini-Study metric , and
the result is that the distance between initial state @xmath and final
state @xmath measured by the Fubini-Study metric is [ 87 ]

  -- -- -- ------
           (40)
  -- -- -- ------

We note that @xmath if the states are orthogonal, in which case it is
maximal. The independence of this distance on the phase and
normalization of either state is explicit in the above formula. Wootters
[ 88 ] has proposed that this distance also serves as a measure of
statistical fluctuations in a sequence of measurements of quantum
states. Moreover, @xmath is the only Riemannian distance (up to
rescaling) invariant by any unitary [ 87 , 88 ] . The argument of the
arc cosine above is the square root of the fidelity between the two
states, so we can also write

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (41)
  -- -------- -- ------

A consistency check left to the reader is to apply @xmath to two
neighboring states and obtain ¹³ ¹³ 13 The relation @xmath may be of
help. @xmath .

##### Geodesics of the Fubini-Study metric

We can also find the geodesics linking any two given states. Since the
geodesics belong to a two-dimensional subspace, we can discuss them
using the Bloch sphere ¹⁴ ¹⁴ 14 For readers unfamiliar with the Bloch
sphere, it is a standard vector representation of a qubit state very
similar to the expectation value @xmath of a spin- @xmath system, see [
90 , p.168] . . From Appendix Integration of the Fubini-Study metric we
know that states of the form Eq. ( 39 ) will travel along a geodesic if
and only if

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (42)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is any monotonic real function null at @xmath and equal to
one at @xmath and @xmath , @xmath are such that the combination in Eq. (
39 ) equals @xmath at @xmath .

Let us begin by the geodesics linking non-orthogonal states, so that
@xmath for all times and singularities are avoided. Eq. ( 42 ) then
guarantees that the ratio @xmath is well-behaved, and we can hence write

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (43)
  -- -------- -- ------

We can disregard the overall factor @xmath and substitute Eq. ( 42 ) in
Eq. ( 43 ), obtaining

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (44)
  -- -------- -- ------

from which one sees that the relative phase between the components is
fixed along the path. This necessarily implies that geodesics lie along
a great circle of the Bloch sphere. These conclusions can be seen even
more clearly if, without any loss of generality, the phase of @xmath is
chosen such that @xmath , making both coefficients of @xmath real. Bloch
vectors with all real components are confined to a plane and, given that
these are pure states, to a great circle. There are two paths between
two non-orthogonal states along a great circle of the Bloch sphere. It
is intuitive that the geodesic is given by the shorter of these paths.
This is indeed confirmed by Eq. ( 44 ) in that @xmath is never
orthogonal to @xmath .

For orthogonal states, one may use the divisibility of geodesic paths,
i.e., the fact that any (compact) section of a geodesic is also a
geodesic. Let @xmath be orthogonal to @xmath . Because every vector in
the vicinity of @xmath is linked to @xmath through a great-circle
geodesic, the (infinitely many) great circles linking @xmath to @xmath
are the only suitable candidates for the geodesics. It can be easily
seen that all such great circles are, in fact, geodesics between the
orthogonal states.

We observe that, although the geometry of pure quantum states shown so
far is analogous to Euclidean geometry on the Bloch sphere, the
analogies break down with the inclusion of mixed states.

##### Comments on another distance

We now take a moment to mention another function present in the
discussion of distances in quantum state space, the Bures distance ¹⁵ ¹⁵
15 The nomenclature becomes quite cumbersome here: the Bures distance is
different from the so-called Bures angle (a.k.a. Bures arc or even Bures
length , even though it is a distance, not a length, by geometric
definitions), which is a generalization of the Fubini-Study distance;
all of them can be written in terms of the Bures fidelity .

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (45)
  -- -------- -- ------

This is a distance in the projective Hilbert space in the sense that it
obeys the axioms of Eq. ( 34 ), but it is not Riemannian, because it
cannot be obtained as the shortest path along elements of the projective
space. It is possible, though, to obtain @xmath as the length of a path
along the Hilbert vector space. The distinction matters because this
path must necessarily go through nonnormalized vectors and this length
is only obtained when distinguishing collinear vectors (differing only
by normalization). This is shown in Fig. 2 , which represents the vector
space as a plane: only through the straight-line (solid) path is @xmath
attained. Were the path traveled on the unit circle (dashed line), it
would coincide with a special case of the Fubini-Study metric, and
@xmath would be found ¹⁶ ¹⁶ 16 We warn the reader familiarized with the
Bloch sphere that, contrary to first intuition, intermediate states like
@xmath in Fig. 2 are pure, nonnormalized states. .

This assertion can perhaps be seen best by the fact that the above form
is only valid for unit vectors. If we write this distance for vectors of
different norm, such as @xmath of Fig. 2 , we get

  -- -- -- ------
           (46)
  -- -- -- ------

In other words, the Bures distance is only Riemannian if one
distinguishes between collinear vectors. If restricted to unit vectors,
it is a valid distance on the projective Hilbert space, but loses its
Riemannian character ¹⁷ ¹⁷ 17 For the sake of completeness, we mention
that @xmath is the shortest length on the quotient space obtained by
identifying vectors which differ only by a phase, as can be seen by the
phase-independence of Eq. ( 46 ). . Most importantly, it certainly
cannot be obtained from @xmath (Eq. 38 ), which is independent of
normalization. We will see shortly that the quantities we are interested
in must be integrated in the projective space, i.e., without regard to
overall normalization, and hence @xmath will not be of much interest to
us ¹⁸ ¹⁸ 18 We also note that the Hilbert-Schmidt distance for mixed
states, @xmath , reduces to Eq. ( 46 ) for pure states and is subject to
the same limitations as the Bures distance. .

#### Mandelstam-Tamm bound obtained geometrically

Anandan and Aharonov [ 40 , 41 ] have put the knowledge of quantum-state
geometry to use in the pursuit of a quantum speed limit. This can be
done as follows: let us calculate the differential form @xmath of the
Fubini-Study metric assuming that the variation of @xmath is governed by
Schrödinger’s equation with Hamiltonian @xmath . We have

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (47)
  -- -------- -- ------

where now @xmath is, in fact, time. Substitution into Eq. ( 38 ) yields

  -- -- -- ------
           (48)
  -- -- -- ------

where the variance of the Hamiltonian (written for non-normalized @xmath
) can be recognized in the square brackets above. The independence of
this distance from global phase and normalization is also evident from
this expression. If we integrate this differential along the states
through which the system goes during evolution, we obtain the length of
the path followed by the state:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (49)
  -- -------- -- ------

The Mandelstam-Tamm bound, within this framework, amounts to stating
that the distance @xmath between two states is, by definition, shorter
than or equal to the length @xmath of any path connecting them. In
mathematical terms,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (50)
  -- -------- -- ------

recovering Eq. ( 7 ). We note that this demonstration is valid for pure
states evolving unitarily.

A slightly different interpretation of the above formula is more useful
for the obtention of bounds on evolution time. In a given evolution, the
most a final state can be distant from the initial one is the length of
the path followed by the system. Accordingly, the minimal time necessary
for the distance to reach a chosen value (or, equivalently, for the
fidelity to reach a chosen value) is the time at which the path length
reaches this value. This can be seen with the help of the graph on Fig.
3 , where @xmath is plotted against time. Given a certain value @xmath
of the distance, the minimal time @xmath needed to reach it is that
which makes the area under the curve @xmath equal @xmath .

A breakthrough of the geometric interpretation of the bound was to
enable a clear, straightforward criterion for its saturation: it occurs
when evolution follows a geodesic. We have seen that geodesics are great
circles of the Bloch sphere. On the other hand, any Hamiltonian
evolution of a qubit is locally a rotation around some axis of the Bloch
sphere. A state evolving along a geodesic must then perform a rotation
around a fixed axis and, furthermore, belong to a great circle, which
must, then, be the equator relative to this axis. The only pure states
that obey these conditions and hence saturate the Mandelstam-Tamm
inequality for unitary evolutions are equiprobable on any pair of energy
eigenstates @xmath , @xmath , or

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (51)
  -- -------- -- ------

where the phase @xmath has a monotonic dependence on @xmath . Although
@xmath must be a rotation around a fixed axis, there can be a time
dependence of the form @xmath , where @xmath is the Pauli operator
relative to the direction of the axis, as long as @xmath does not change
sign. The phase @xmath is related to @xmath by @xmath .

##### Summary

The main results of this Section are that Anandan and Aharonov
recognized @xmath as the differential of a well established metric, the
Fubini-Study metric. This allowed the bound to be reinterpreted as
stating that the length of any path is greater than or equal to the
distance between its endpoints. The (finite) distance measured by this
metric is @xmath , whereas the length is the integral of @xmath , and so
the inequality is proved in geometric terms. Saturation occurs on
geodesic paths, where the length equals the distance between the
endpoints.

We end this Section with a simple analogy. The quantity @xmath is the
speed of evolution. It is analogous to what is measured by the
speedometer of a car, in that it does not distinguish the direction of
the path in any way. Given a traveled course, the information given by
the speedometer allows one to calculate the traveled length @xmath along
the path and, furthermore, the time @xmath it takes to travel such
length. Since the actual straight-line (geodesic) distance @xmath
between starting and finish points may not be greater than the length (
@xmath ), @xmath is a lower bound on the time needed to become @xmath
apart from the starting point. Only if the path is traveled in a
straight line do length and distance coincide.

### Fisher information

We now introduce a quantity which is of great importance to our work,
the quantum Fisher information. We begin by a predecessor that naturally
appears in estimation theory, the Fisher information (sometimes called “
classical Fisher information” in contrast to the quantum Fisher
information, in a bit of a misnomer).

Historically, the Fisher information arose in the study of the method of
maximum likelihood, which is a procedure, started by Fisher in 1912 [ 94
] , to find the best fit of given data to a theoretical curve with free
parameters. This method rivals the minimum variance unbiased estimator,
which basically consists in the least squares method constrained to
unbiased estimators, as well as the method of moments, which fits @xmath
parameters of a theoretical curve so that the @xmath first moments of
curve and data coincide (for more on these methods, see [ 98 ] ). The
importance of the Fisher information goes beyond this particular method
as it has relevant properties concerning any estimation, as we will see
by the Cramér-Rao bound, Eq. ( 59 ). Already suggested in 1922 by Fisher
in works such as [ 95 ] , he explicitly called it an information in 1925
in [ 96 ] , then later again in 1934 in [ 97 ] , among others ¹⁹ ¹⁹ 19
Due to the plethora of works by Fisher in those decades, see [ 104 ,
p.564] , it is not easy to pinpoint all the appearances of the Fisher
information in the literature of the time. . A more detailed
introduction to both “classical” and quantum Fisher information starting
from the maximum-likelihood estimation can be found in [ 99 ] (in
Portuguese).

The Fisher information is useful when there is some parameter @xmath
that is to be estimated. This parameter has a true value @xmath , a
value that one can never exactly obtain, but is considered to exist. The
definition further assumes that one performs some sort of procedure
related to the parameter, which produces an outcome @xmath out of a
given set @xmath . These outcomes can occur with certain probabilities
@xmath , which should depend on the true value @xmath of @xmath ; this
dependence is denoted by @xmath . Since @xmath is not known, one must
work, for every possible value of @xmath , with @xmath , the probability
distribution as if the parameter had true value @xmath . For each @xmath
, the distribution is normalized as @xmath . One can naturally repeat
the estimation many times to enhance the result. Adaptations for the
case of a continuous distribution are straightforward, but do not
concern us here.

The estimation procedure itself cannot yield @xmath or @xmath . The
@xmath must be obtained for each @xmath , usually by models, and the
actual outcomes are then compared to predictions from the models. An
estimation can be understood as a way to extract, from the outcome(s)
@xmath that has(have) been obtained, a value for the parameter @xmath .
The simplest form of doing that is perhaps to average the numerical
values obtained (a subcase of the method of moments). The
maximum-likelihood estimation searches instead for the true value of
@xmath which would be most likely to produce the observed outcome(s) by
maximizing with respect to @xmath a certain function of the
probabilities @xmath with @xmath restricted to the set of observed
outcomes (see [ 99 , Sect.2.1.1] or [ 104 , p.498] ).

A well-defined estimation procedure then entails a parameter @xmath with
an unknown true value @xmath , an outcome set @xmath , and a set of
outcome probabilities @xmath for each possible value @xmath . The Fisher
information with respect to parameter @xmath is defined as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (52)
  -- -------- -- ------

It is intuitive that, for an actual estimation to be relevant, the
probability distribution of the outcomes @xmath must in some way depend
on @xmath . The presence of the derivative of @xmath expresses this
necessity of an @xmath -dependence of @xmath for the Fisher information
to be nonzero: if the pointer of your meter does not depend in any way
of the parameter @xmath , it cannot convey any information on @xmath .
To say that “even a broken clock is right twice a day” may be
heartwarming or funny, but one knows better than to try to estimate time
from it (by “broken clock” we consider a clock that has come to a full
halt). If a broken clock displays, e.g., the time 9:47, its outcome
probabilities are @xmath and @xmath for any other time. The clock has no
(Fisher) information on the actual time because these probabilities do
not depend on it.

Another useful expression for the Fisher information is

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (53)
  -- -------- -- ------

which is directly implied by Eq. ( 52 ).

Let us give a physical example. Estimation of physical parameters is
typically made by experiments. The outcomes @xmath can correspond to the
sets of raw data obtained after each repetition, but it is more
insightful to assign to @xmath the obtained numerical values of the
parameter at hand. Let us say a group of undergraduate students is
tasked with finding the gravitational acceleration @xmath on the surface
of the Earth by an inclined-plane experiment ²⁰ ²⁰ 20 Readers
familiarized with the undergraduate Physics courses of the University
should readily identify the reference to “FisExp”. . Imprecision is
naturally present due to imperfection on the measurement devices,
finite-sized markings for registering position, parallax, among many
others ²¹ ²¹ 21 There may even be a certain contribution due to subideal
interest by the students, on rare occasions. . Considering that
uncertainty only allows @xmath to be estimated up to a single decimal
place in SI, we expect a higher probability of reaching values around
@xmath , but the set of possible outcomes @xmath is the set of values
spaced by the precision of @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (54)
  -- -------- -- ------

Such a coarse graining by precision limitations will always be present
in physical experiments and is the reason why we are concerned with
discrete outcome sets @xmath .

It is crucial that the probability of obtaining a given outcome depend
on the true value @xmath . Suppose the estimation is made in two
different places on Earth, the high mountains of Huascarán, in the
Peruvian Andes, and the Arctic Sea, such that @xmath is different in
these cases. Furthermore, in addition to the simple didactic laboratory
used by the undergraduate students, the measurement of @xmath in each of
those places is also done by higher-precision satellites, allowing for
an extra decimal place ²² ²² 22 For completeness, we mention that actual
satellite experiments, as in [ 100 ] , can be a thousand times more
precise; the argument does not depend on such a high precision, though.
. In Fig. 4 , we show a simulation of the distributions of @xmath in the
four cases, assuming @xmath (Huascarán, Andes) and @xmath (Arctic Sea);
these two values are inspired by measured data taken from [ 100 ] . The
@xmath or @xmath cannot be obtained by measurements; instead, models (of
measurement and dynamics) assign @xmath for each possible @xmath , and
the actual measurements are then compared to distributions from the
models.

The capability of @xmath to discern a minute difference in the true
value of @xmath is essential for a precise estimation. The higher
precision of the satellite experiments is translated in the way it is
easier to distinguish the true values of @xmath from the @xmath of these
measurements. The Fisher information is a measure of this very property:
how much does the outcome distribution change by a change of the
underlying true value of the parameter?

This interpretation is helped out by the definition of the Hellinger
distance, a distance between probability distributions @xmath for a
given set @xmath of outcomes. If one assumes that two probability
distributions are different because they belong to two different values
@xmath , @xmath of the parameter, the Hellinger distance @xmath can be
written as a function of these values [ 101 , p.33] (or [ 99 , p.16] )

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (55)
  -- -------- -- ------

We remark nonetheless that @xmath is a distance only on the set of
probability distributions. It obeys Eq. ( 34 ), and especially Eq. ( 34a
), for the probability distributions @xmath , @xmath , not necessarily
for parameter values @xmath , @xmath . In other words, @xmath does not
measure variations of the parameter @xmath , but instead how
distinguishable the distribution @xmath becomes if @xmath is varied. If
distinct parameter values correspond to the same distribution, as in the
broken clock, @xmath will be zero.

These aspects of the Hellinger distance are analogous to some of what
has been said about the Fisher information, and we now show how they are
mathematically related. The first step is to rewrite the Fisher
information as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (56)
  -- -------- -- ------

and then to write @xmath for infinitesimally separated arguments @xmath
, @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (57)
  -- -------- -- ------

By comparing the two equations, it is easy to see that, to lowest order
in @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (58)
  -- -------- -- ------

i.e., the Fisher information is the core of the infinitesimal form of
that distance, measuring how probability distributions grow apart due to
an infinitesimal variation of the parameter.

Another sign of the importance of the Fisher information is that it
bounds the precision of any parameter estimation. This connection is
established by the Cramér-Rao bound, shown independently by Rao [ 103 ]
and Cramér [ 104 , p.480] , although some results had been anticipated
by Fisher, as recognized in [ 105 ] . The Cramér-Rao relation states
that the error @xmath of an estimation is bounded from below:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (59)
  -- -------- -- ------

Our interest will be to use the Fisher information not in estimation
theory, but as (the square of) a speed related to the geometry of
quantum states, so the reader interested in this result (and its proof)
is referred to a more detailed discussion to be found in [ 102 , Sect.2]
or in [ 99 , Sect.2.1.2 onwards] , which are works dedicated
specifically to parameter estimation.

#### The quantum Fisher information

The Fisher information can naturally be applied to the estimation of a
parameter via a physical measurement, be it on a classical or quantum
system. Although no estimation, in either case, can be exact, there is
an important difference in the sources of imprecisions in the classical
and quantum scenarios. Classically, it is the imperfection of the
measurement/estimation process that introduces errors; classical states
themselves would allow for perfect estimations if probed by perfect,
idealized apparatus. In quantum mechanics, indeterminacy originates
additionally from the probabilistic nature of quantum states. Even with
ideal measurements, one cannot in general obtain complete information
about a parameter on which a quantum state depends, because it is not
possible, in general, to distinguish between two non-orthogonal quantum
states. The quantum Fisher information aims to quantify how much about a
certain parameter can be learned by a quantum state that depends on it,
assuming the best measurements possible. The classical counterpart to
this quantity would be trivially infinite — different classical states
are always perfectly distinguishable —; the goal here is to measure how
imperfect the information possessed by a quantum state is
(alternatively, how finite it is).

An important difference between the original Fisher information and its
quantum version is that, whereas the former is defined for each specific
estimation procedure, the latter is a function solely of the quantum
state and of its dependence on the parameter to be estimated. This is
possible because the Fisher information requires a set of outcomes and
its occurrence probabilities, while quantum measurement theory, by
indicating what the possible measurements are, supplies both of these.
The quantum Fisher information is, in fact, the Fisher information of
the best measurement available on the quantum state.

Let us now give an introductory example, admittedly oversimplified.
Consider that one wishes to measure the coupling constant @xmath of an
interaction between a field and a two-level atom ²³ ²³ 23 The
interaction in this example is given by the Jaynes-Cummings model on
resonance. . Atom and field will be left to interact for a certain time
@xmath , and the experiment makes a measurement solely on the atom. The
main idea is that the atom starts in a state @xmath and is driven to
@xmath by the field. The stronger the coupling constant @xmath , the
closer to @xmath the final state will be. Let us assume for the sake of
simplicity that there is a maximal value to @xmath , which is @xmath ,
and that the total interaction time @xmath is so chosen that the final
state will be exactly @xmath if @xmath . Other values of @xmath will
leave the state after @xmath in a mixture of @xmath and @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (60)
  -- -------- -- ------

with the representation @xmath , @xmath .

By letting the system interact for a time @xmath and measuring @xmath in
this basis, @xmath , one can make a crude estimate of the value of
@xmath . Since @xmath and @xmath , the Fisher information for this
estimation is

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (61)
  -- -------- -- ------

where the subscript @xmath indicates the measurement basis. One can see
from this expression that the estimate is worst for values of @xmath
close to @xmath , as expected ²⁴ ²⁴ 24 A possibility to reduce error is,
of course, to repeat the experiment multiple times. It has been shown [
99 , p.17] that the Fisher information is additive , i.e., in @xmath
independent runs of an estimation, @xmath . . Due to the idealizations
in this model, when @xmath equals @xmath or @xmath , the measurement
outcome is certain. This is reflected by the behavior @xmath on these
two values, which corresponds to the possibility of making an error-free
measurement. A more realistic description would be to assume some degree
of irremovable mixture on the initial and final states, which would
produce a well-behaved @xmath . We nevertheless keep treating this
idealization in order to present some of the important ideas.

As crude as this estimation may be, it is certainly better than to
measure in the “rotated” basis @xmath , with @xmath . The outcomes on
this basis have no dependence on @xmath ( @xmath for both measurements
for every @xmath ) and hence yield no information whatsoever on the
parameter, @xmath . It can be shown that the original basis @xmath is,
in fact, the most capable of distinguishing values of @xmath . The
quantum Fisher information for the estimation of @xmath , denoted @xmath
, of the state @xmath from Eq. ( 60 ) is precisely the Fisher
information of the best measurement,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (62)
  -- -------- -- ------

Now turning to a more formal discussion, we know from Section POVMs that
all possible measurements on a quantum system are given by POVMs. In the
above example, simple orthogonal projectors were used, @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath , and the POVMs employed to obtain the Fisher
information were @xmath for @xmath and @xmath for @xmath . In general,
the quantum Fisher information for estimation of parameter @xmath is
defined as the maximum of the Fisher information over all POVMs, i.e.,

  -- -- -- ------
           (63)
  -- -- -- ------

where we have used that @xmath .

The Cramér-Rao bound is still valid for @xmath , but it is now a bound
not on the error of a specific estimation procedure, but on the error of
any estimation of @xmath from state @xmath . The quantum Cramér-Rao
bound reads

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (64)
  -- -------- -- ------

We are interested, however, in viewing the quantum Fisher information in
a different light. We have seen that it is a quantity depending only on
the state @xmath and on its dependence on the parameter @xmath . The
example given in Fig. 4 shows that the “classical” Fisher information
can measure how much probability distributions grow apart as the
parameter varies. Since the quantum version maximizes the Fisher
information over all possible measurements, @xmath should be sensitive
to any variation of @xmath . In fact, we now show an important result
that substantiates this interpretation.

Suppose one is interested in distinguishing two neighboring states,
characterized by parameter values @xmath and @xmath , using measurements
indicated by the POVM @xmath . The Hellinger distance Eq.( 55 ) between
the two probability distributions is

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (65)
  -- -------- -- ------

Now let us assume that @xmath and @xmath are infinitesimally separated,
@xmath . We know from Eq. ( 58 ) that @xmath is related to the
(“classical”) Fisher information @xmath , so that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (66)
  -- -------- -- ------

The subscript on the right-hand side serves as a reminder that this
equation is valid for any POVM. By choosing the POVM that maximizes this
equation, both left- and right-hand sides at the same time. By writing
the above for such a POVM, we obtain, due to the definition of the
quantum Fisher information and to Eq. ( 33 ),

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (67)
  -- -------- -- ------

or, solving for @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (68)
  -- -------- -- ------

This very important relation shows that, as we have mentioned less
formally, the quantum Fisher information is a measure of the rate at
which a state becomes distinct following the variation of a parameter.
When the parameter in question is time, @xmath can be understood as a
speed of the evolving state. This result will be relevant for our
geometrically-derived bound in the next Section.

Another important expression for the quantum Fisher information can be
obtained by the use of the symmetric logarithmic derivative @xmath [ 106
, 107 ] . For a given parameter @xmath and a given state @xmath , @xmath
is the Hermitian operator implicitly defined by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (69)
  -- -------- -- ------

This is, in fact, a way to quantize the classical expression @xmath
accounting for the non-commutativity of @xmath and @xmath . The
existence of such an operator is guaranteed by an application of the
Riesz-Fréchet theorem to Hilbert spaces [ 107 , p.257] .

We reproduce the derivation in [ 99 , p.37] of the relation linking
@xmath to @xmath . It begins with a bound on @xmath , obtained observing
that

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -- -------
                                                                                              
                                                                         @xmath   @xmath      (70a)
                                                                                              (70b)
                                                                                              (70c)
                                                                                  @xmath      (70d)
  But the inner product @xmath obeys the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, so                        
                                                                                              
                                                                         @xmath   @xmath      (70e)
                                                                                  @xmath      (70f)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -- -------

The quantum Fisher information is then bounded by

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (71a)
              @xmath      (71b)
              @xmath      (71c)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

To demonstrate the equality, we must show that there is a POVM @xmath
such that both inequalities in Eqs. ( 70 ) turn into equalities for all
@xmath . For Eq. ( 70d ), equality amounts to

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (72)
  -- -------- -- ------

while equality in the Cauchy-Schwarz relation of Eq. ( 70e ) is
equivalent to

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (73)
  -- -------- -- ------

for some ²⁵ ²⁵ 25 The case @xmath need not obey Eq. ( 73 ), but attains
both equalities in Eqs. ( 70d , 70e ) trivially, since @xmath . complex
@xmath . We remark that if a POVM obeys Eq. ( 73 ) with real @xmath for
all @xmath , both conditions are met. But this last equation can be
rewritten as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (74)
  -- -------- -- ------

By taking projector POVMs, such that @xmath , we can assure that there
is at least one solution to the above for each @xmath , because @xmath
is Hermitian and hence diagonalizable with real eigenvalues.

We have thus shown that the quantum Fisher information can be written as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (75)
  -- -------- -- ------

This can be understood as an alternate definition of the quantum Fisher
information, somewhat analogous to Eq. ( 52 ). The concision of this
expression does not incur in an easier calculation of @xmath , since the
symmetric logarithmic derivative is often cumbersome to obtain. We show
in Section Calculating the quantum Fisher information a more feasible
method of calculating the quantum Fisher information developed by our
group [ 112 , 111 ] .

We now turn to the Section where we present our main result.

### The most general quantum speed limit

We are now ready to derive our main result, the bound on quantum
evolutions be they unitary or not. This is a bound that encompasses any
kind of evolution a quantum system can undergo. Because non-unitary
evolutions can turn pure states into mixed ones, the first step will be
to define a distance valid for mixed as well as pure states. We make
extensive use of the purifications presented in Section Purifications .

#### A distance for all quantum states

Along the lines of Section Geometric Approach , we are interested in
metrics that can be computed by integrating a differential form. Let us
define the differential form of the distance between two neighboring
states @xmath and @xmath as the minimal Fubini-Study differential of
their respective purifications @xmath and @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (76)
  -- -------- -- ------

where the minimum is taken over all purifications of @xmath and @xmath ,
but can equivalently be taken over the purifications of only one of the
states. The corresponding length is

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (77)
  -- -------- -- ------

We are interested in minimizing not the integrand, but the integrated
length. The first condition to do so is to have a non-negative
integrand, which @xmath is by definition. A second potential hindrance
would be the fact that each state @xmath along the path belongs to two
differentials on the integration, @xmath and @xmath , except for the
path endpoints. The purification of @xmath used to minimize the distance
of the first pair could, in principle, not be compatible with minimizing
the latter pair. This is however not the case, because we know @xmath
can be expressed as a decreasing function of the fidelity @xmath (or
overlap) of two pure states, and we have seen in Eq. ( 31 ) that the
maximization of the fidelity of two purifications can be performed
varying the purification of only one of the mixed states. We may then
write

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (78)
  -- -------- -- ------

where minimization is now performed over all purifications of each state
of the path.

A distance can, as before, be defined as the length of the shortest path
between two states,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (79)
  -- -------- -- ------

but the order of the minimizations may be inverted, so that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (80)
  -- -------- -- ------

with the minimization being performed over all purifications @xmath ,
@xmath of @xmath , @xmath . Because @xmath is a decreasing function of
the fidelity, we can write

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (81)
  -- -------- -- ------

where we have used Uhlmann’s theorem, Eq. ( 31 ).

This distance is called Bures angle (among other names, see footnote on
p. Comments on another distance ), and is not only valid as a distance
for mixed quantum states, but also possesses the most important of the
Riemannian features, that of being able to be obtained as an integral of
a differential @xmath . Just as with the Fubini-Study distance on p. 13
, a consistency check left to reader is to verify that @xmath for
infinitesimally separated @xmath , @xmath .

It is indeed quite intuitive to generalize the Fubini-Study distance to
mixed states by replacing the pure-state fidelity for the Bures
fidelity, but there are two reasons for carrying the derivation as
above. Firstly, it explicitly shows the relation between the finite
Bures angle and its differential @xmath . Secondly, there are other
functions of two mixed states that recover the pure-state fidelity in
the proper limit; this route reinforces the importance of the Bures
fidelity by naturally arriving at it via Uhlmann’s theorem.

#### The bound

We now have a proper distance also for mixed states, but what is its
relation to the dynamics of a quantum system? This is our main result,
obtained in collaboration with B.M. Escher, L. Davidovich, R.L. de Matos
Filho and published in [ 82 ] .

Let us consider a state @xmath which evolves in time from @xmath to
@xmath and travels a given path. The length of this path is necessarily
greater than (or equal to) the distance between @xmath and @xmath . This
statement, written in a shorthand notation in which @xmath is the
distance between these two states (and analogously for any @xmath at
other times), reads

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (82)
  -- -------- -- ------

But @xmath can be written in terms of @xmath by noting that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (83)
  -- -------- -- ------

so that, with @xmath and taking @xmath to be infinitesimal,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (84)
  -- -------- -- ------

The length is then written as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (85)
  -- -------- -- ------

Since only through the Bures fidelity does the distance depend on the
states, and hence on the parameter @xmath , the integrand can be
calculated using the chain rule,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (86)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath and @xmath is a notation used to stress that the distance
@xmath is a function of @xmath . We know from the relation between these
two (Eq. 81 ) that @xmath tends to infinity in the limit at hand, @xmath
. Furthermore, Eq. ( 68 ) informs us that the first derivative of @xmath
, @xmath vanishes for @xmath . The indeterminacy can be removed with the
aid of l’Hôpital’s rule,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (87)
  -- -------- -- ------

The numerator is, due to Eq. ( 68 ), proportional to the quantum Fisher
information. The denominator, when multiplied and divided by @xmath ,
yields

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (88)
  -- -------- -- ------

The first factor in parentheses can be calculated independently of
@xmath by replacing the limit @xmath by @xmath since the metric @xmath
only depends on @xmath through @xmath . The second factor in parentheses
is simply a recurrence of @xmath , the term we are calculating.
Substituting in ( 87 ) and rearranging the terms, one finds

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (89)
  -- -------- -- ------

Multiplying and dividing by @xmath , the length is given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (90)
  -- -------- -- ------

and substitution in Eq. ( 82 ) leads to the general bound

  -- -- -- ------
           (91)
  -- -- -- ------

Let us make three comments about the formula above. First, the integral
of the quantum Fisher information is to be interpreted as a path
integral parametrized by time @xmath . @xmath is a local quantity,
dependent on the state at @xmath and its neighboring values, and hence
dependent on the chosen path. Another relevant remark is that the
freedom to regauge the distance by a constant @xmath , @xmath , does not
affect the bound, since the @xmath -dependent prefactor in the equation
cancels such a constant. Lastly, because @xmath diverges at @xmath , the
bound can be rewritten as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (92)
  -- -------- -- ------

and this shows that this prefactor depends on the curvature of the graph
of @xmath as a function of @xmath at @xmath .

We can now replace @xmath for @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (93)
  -- -------- -- ------

where the prefactor tends to one. This is the main result of the present
thesis. It can be summarized as: the length of the traveled path in
state space must be less than (or equal to) the distance between initial
and final states. For infinitesimal variations, the length is in fact
equal to the distance. This implies that the relation above is an
equality in the immediate vicinity of @xmath . Eq. ( 68 ) applied to
time serves as a suitable expansion to show that the bound is saturated
up to second order in time:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (94)
  -- -------- -- ------

Although originally defined in quantum metrology, the quantum Fisher
information for time estimation is closely related to the dynamics of
the system. This is seen best by remembering that @xmath and seeing that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (95)
  -- -------- -- ------

where the dot over @xmath represents the time derivative. In fact, there
is a closed form for @xmath for unitary evolutions which clearly
reflects the dynamics of the system. Any unitary evolution can be
written as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (96)
  -- -------- -- ------

with @xmath , and equivalently as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (97)
  -- -------- -- ------

with @xmath being the Hamiltonian governing the evolution, @xmath .

For a system always in pure states, the relation @xmath can be derived
with respect to time, so

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (98)
     @xmath      (99)
     @xmath      (100)
  -- -------- -- -------

such that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (101)
     @xmath      (102)
  -- -------- -- -------

The last two, together with @xmath , allow us to write

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (103)
              @xmath      (104)
              @xmath      (105)
              @xmath      (106)
              @xmath      (107)
              @xmath      (108)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the variance of @xmath . We thus see that, for unitary
pure-state evolutions, the quantum Fisher information for time
estimation is simply the energy variance of the system. Substituting
this result in the general bound, Eq. ( 93 ), we exactly recover the
Mandelstam-Tamm bound for unitary evolutions, Eqs. ( 16 ), ( 50 ). The
result of Eq. ( 108 ) will be of utmost importance to the method we will
present in Section Calculating the quantum Fisher information to
calculate the quantum Fisher information.

This geometric derivation provides, as before, a clear criterion for
saturation. Equality will prevail on Eq. ( 93 ) if, and only if, the
state travels on a geodesic. We note that pure-state geodesics are still
geodesics on the space of density operators, but that there are more
geodesic paths, even for a qubit. In Chapter Applying the bounds , we
apply this bound to different examples, and in some cases we will see
saturation, i.e., evolution on geodesics.

A last comment is that related derivations are possible for parameter
estimation, with which the precision of estimates of parameter @xmath
can be bound employing the quantum Fisher information for estimation of
@xmath , @xmath .

### Additional results

We now present additional bounds, which may not have the generality of
the main result above, but are steps in the way of establishing the
Margolus-Levitin bound in a more structured, geometric framework. We
later show that one of these bounds can be saturated in conditions under
which neither the Mandelstam-Tamm nor the Margolus-Levitin bounds are.
The contents of this Section can be considered as partial results in a
work in progress.

This calculation is valid for pure states only, evolving unitarily under
a time-independent Hamiltonian. We base our derivation partially on the
calculations by Zwierz [ 50 ] . If the governing Hamiltonian is denoted
@xmath , the state @xmath of the system (initially in @xmath ), obeys

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (109)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a real function explicitly depicting the freedom to
choose the ground-state energy. The distance @xmath between initial and
final states varies in time according to

  -- -------- -- -- -------
     @xmath         (110)
                    (111)
                    (112)
  -- -------- -- -- -------

where we used the fact that @xmath . This implies that the bound can
only be saturated while the distance decreases monotonically.
Furthermore, since @xmath , the square root on the last equation reduces
to @xmath , so that we can write

  -- -- -- -------
           (113)
  -- -- -- -------

where the argument @xmath of @xmath has been simplified to @xmath for
cleanness. The derivative of @xmath can be bounded by

  -- -- -- -- -------
              (114)
              (115)
              (116)
              (117)
  -- -- -- -- -------

such that

  -- -- -- -------
           (118)
  -- -- -- -------

This bound is valid for any real function @xmath but, unlike the
equation of motion, it is (non-trivially) affected by the choice of
@xmath . We could simply minimize the right-hand side over @xmath in
order to arrive at the tightest bound possible from the above equation,
but we can obtain a more insightful bound making a different
minimization ²⁶ ²⁶ 26 It is left as an exercise to the reader to show
that the direct minimization of Eq. ( 118 ) yields @xmath . The
impracticality of this expression can be seen from the difficulty to
assign a physical meaning to this quantity. .

Let us expand @xmath in the energy eigenbasis, @xmath . We obtain, for
the numerator of the right-hand side of Eq. ( 118 ),

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (119)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we have used the triangle inequality for complex numbers. The
right-hand side of this equation, when substituted in Eq. ( 118 ), still
leads to a bound on @xmath . We then choose to minimize the quantity on
the right-hand side. The value of @xmath yielding this minimum is
independent of @xmath , and we write it simply as @xmath . Our goal is,
then, to minimize

  -- -- -- -------
           (120)
  -- -- -- -------

with respect to @xmath , given @xmath and @xmath , i.e., given a
probability distribution for the set of energy values. This minimization
is performed in Appendix Minimization yielding the median , and yields
@xmath equal to the median of the energy distribution, @xmath .

We can obtain

  -- -- -- -------
           (121)
  -- -- -- -------

using the fact that @xmath granted by Eq. ( 119 ). This substitution
makes the bound less tight, but has the advantage of possessing a simple
time-dependence, since the right-hand side of the above is
time-independent. Integration with respect to time in this case is
straightforward,

  -- -- -- -------
           (122)
  -- -- -- -------

and, upon inversion, one finds

  -- -- -- -------
           (123)
  -- -- -- -------

A tighter bound, however, is obtained replacing @xmath directly in Eq. (
118 ). This is licit because this equation is valid for any @xmath . We
thus arrive at

  -- -- -- -------
           (124)
  -- -- -- -------

Integrating with respect to time, we obtain

  -- -- -- -------
           (125)
  -- -- -- -------

Both bounds can be thought of as of the Margolus-Levitin kind due to
their dependence on the average energy, but are independent from the
known Margolus-Levitin bound in the sense that they do not recover it.
We show in Section Application of the additional bound that the latter
bound, Eq. ( 125 ), can be tight in cases where neither the
Mandelstam-Tamm nor the Margolus-Levitin bound are, a fact which vouches
for its usefulness.

##### Chapter Summary and Next Steps

We have derived our novel results in this Chapter, preceded by the
necessary framework. The most general (and most important) bound is
given by Eq. ( 93 ) in Section The most general quantum speed limit . We
begin the next Chapter by presenting an important method for calculating
the quantum Fisher information in Section Calculating the quantum Fisher
information , instrumental to the application of our main bound to
physical examples, which is done later in Section Application to
non-unitary channels . Application of our additional bounds is left to
Section Application of the additional bound .

## Applying the bounds

After having presented our novel results in the last Chapter, we now
devote ourselves to the application of those bounds to physical
evolutions. We start by introducing in Section Calculating the quantum
Fisher information an important technique, developed by collaborators
B.M. Escher, N. Zagury, R.L. de Matos Filho and L. Davidovich [ 112 ,
111 ] , for obtaining the quantum Fisher information, a quantity central
to our main result of Eq. ( 93 ). In Section Application to non-unitary
channels we proceed to the actual application of the bound to
non-unitary evolutions. Section Application of the additional bound is
left to the application of the additional bounds of Eqs. ( 123 , 125 ).

### Calculating the quantum Fisher information

#### A purification-based expression

An apparent disadvantage of our bound of Eq. ( 93 ) is the difficulty to
calculate the quantum Fisher information. We here present a method which
enables the calculation of this quantity based on purifications.

The basic idea is that the non-unitary evolution of a given system can
be described by the unitary evolution of its purification. We have seen
in Eq. ( 108 ) that the quantum Fisher information of a unitary
evolution is easy to evaluate. We will see how the quantum Fisher
information of the original system and that of its purification are
related.

Let us consider, as in Section Purifications , a system @xmath in state
@xmath evolving non-unitarily. A purification of @xmath requires an
auxiliary system, denoted @xmath (for “environment”), and is given by a
joint state @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (126)
  -- -------- -- -------

Let us consider @xmath to be an arbitrary purification of @xmath out of
the infinitely many possible. Because @xmath contains all information
about @xmath , it is physically reasonable that the quantum Fisher
information of the former is at least as great as that of the latter. In
fact, the quantum Fisher information of @xmath , denoted @xmath , acts
as an upper bound on the quantum Fisher information of @xmath . This can
be shown by using the definition of quantum Fisher information, Eq. ( 63
), as well as the fact that a POVM element @xmath acting only on @xmath
can be understood as @xmath , where @xmath is the identity on @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (127)
  -- -------- -- -------

We can then write the quantum Fisher information of the state of @xmath
as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (128)
  -- -------- -- -------

whereas that of the purification reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (129)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a POVM element acting on the joint system @xmath . The
quantum Fisher information of the purification is then the result of a
maximization over all POVMs on @xmath , a larger family than that of the
original system, i.e., @xmath is maximized on a subset of that used for
@xmath . Hence @xmath .

The state @xmath remains pure along its evolution, which must then be
describable by a unitary operator @xmath . The Hamiltonian governing the
evolution can always be found by @xmath , and we know from Eq. ( 108 )
that the quantum Fisher information of a unitary evolution is
proportional to the variance of its Hamiltonian, so that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (130)
  -- -------- -- -------

Bringing these results together, we can find a bound on evolution times
written in terms of @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (131)
  -- -------- -- -------

Written in this form, in terms of any purification of @xmath , the bound
may or may not be tight. The choice of purification in fact affects the
saturation of the speed limit.

We show in Appendix Tightness of the bound on the quantum Fisher
information that for each evolution there is at least one purification
whose quantum Fisher information equals that of the original system,
i.e., there is a purification such that @xmath . It can be obtained by
minimizing @xmath , or equivalently @xmath , over all purifications such
that @xmath has the same dimension as @xmath . This means that all
saturation features of our main bound carry over to the above if one
minimizes over such purifications.

In some situations it may, however, be advantageous to forgo the exact
obtention of @xmath and minimize @xmath over a restricted family of
purifications for the sake of practicality. We undertake both full and
partial optimization in the examples in the next Section.

Before we move on to the non-unitary channels, we mention that which is
perhaps the simplest application of this purification procedure: an
initially mixed state of @xmath evolving unitarily. It is possible to
purify it such that the Hamiltonian governing the evolution of the
purification @xmath is the original Hamiltonian acting on the mixed
state. Applying this to Eq. ( 131 ), one can generalize Eqs. ( 7 , 50 )
to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (132)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the standard deviation @xmath of the Hamiltonian is calculated in
the pure or mixed state of system @xmath . This result for unitary
evolutions has been shown by Uhlmann in [ 42 ] also by geometric means.
In this case, the purification yielding the minimum is in fact the one
governed by the original Hamiltonian, so that the bound above is tight
under the same conditions of the general bound.

### Application to non-unitary channels

We now consider some examples of non-unitary evolutions, or channels, to
which we apply our bound. As mentioned previously, our description is
made in terms of purifications. Given a state @xmath of system @xmath
that evolves non-unitarily, let @xmath be a purification of it. The
evolution of this pure state in time can always be described by a
suitable unitary operator, denoted @xmath , so that @xmath .

We know from the previous Section that, in order to obtain the quantum
Fisher information (or a useful bound on it), we need the variance of
the Hamiltonian @xmath respective to @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (133)
  -- -------- -- -------

This variance is, in principle, to be evaluated at time @xmath , i.e.,
in state @xmath . There is nevertheless a tactic to make this evaluation
easier: the expectation value of an operator in state @xmath can be cast
as an expectation value in the initial state @xmath if the evolution
operators are “absorbed” by @xmath . For an operator that satisfies

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (134)
  -- -------- -- -------

its averaging obeys

  -- -- -- -------
           (135)
  -- -- -- -------

and the same goes for any polynomial function of @xmath . This
definition presents a practical advantage: the form of the state in
which the expectation values are taken is simplified, because there is
no time dependence anymore, but the operator maintains a similar level
of complexity when expressed in terms of @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (136)
  -- -------- -- -------

(compare Eq. 133 ). This equation can, in fact, be taken as a definition
of @xmath . This tactic is not restricted to @xmath , along this Chapter
we define several analogous operators based on different unitaries. The
use of fraktur/gothic or other modified fonts always denotes the
employment of this tactic for initial-state averaging, see Table 1 . We
note that, for self-commuting Hamiltonians, @xmath , this tactic does
not change the operator, i.e., @xmath .

Another important point is that the purification @xmath of the process
characterized by @xmath is not unique. The freedom to choose different
purifications can be expressed in the following manner: given a first
purification @xmath and its unitary evolution operator @xmath , every
other purification of the process can be obtained through

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (137)
  -- -------- -- -------

by varying @xmath , a unitary operator acting only on system @xmath
(note that @xmath is also unitary). When we need to minimize over all
purifications, as required by Section Calculating the quantum Fisher
information , it suffices to minimize over all unitary operators @xmath
acting on the environment @xmath only.

Moreover, we are interested in minimizing the variance of the
Hamiltonian corresponding to the unitary operator @xmath . We once again
use the tactic for initial-state averaging, so that we are faced with
the problem of minimizing the variance of

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (138)
  -- -------- -- -------

It is straightforward to show that @xmath can be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (139)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is defined from @xmath analogously to the way @xmath was
from @xmath , see Table 1 . The minimization over @xmath then amounts to
minimizing over all possible Hermitian operators @xmath .

Turning once more to the mixed state evolving unitarily, the suitable
first purification is that whose evolution is governed by the original
Hamiltonian. It is then straightforward to see that @xmath ,
corresponding to @xmath , yields the minimal variance of @xmath from
Eq. ( 139 ).

#### Amplitude-damping channel

The first example to which we apply our bound is the so-called
amplitude-damping channel. This channel is useful for describing energy
loss: a qubit (system @xmath ) initially in the excited state @xmath
that decays onto the ground state @xmath . We suppose there is a
probability @xmath of @xmath not decaying to @xmath in the interval
@xmath (conversely, a probability @xmath of a @xmath -decay up to time
@xmath ; it should be clear that @xmath ). This evolution of @xmath is
described by

  -- -- -- -------
           (140)
  -- -- -- -------

with the representation @xmath , @xmath . The most prevalent case of the
amplitude-damping channel is when @xmath and the system is initially in
the excited state @xmath . In this scenario, the qubit evolves along
mixtures of @xmath and @xmath with varying weights. In the Bloch sphere,
this corresponds to a path along the axis connecting @xmath to @xmath ,
see Fig. 5 .

For the purposes of calculating the quantum Fisher information, we now
need to write the evolution of @xmath in the form of a purification,
which explicitly includes an auxiliary system @xmath . System @xmath
only needs to be a qubit, so whenever the initial state of @xmath is
pure the channel can be described by

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (141a)
     @xmath               (141b)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is chosen as the initial state of @xmath and @xmath is
orthogonal to it ²⁷ ²⁷ 27 It is left as an exercise to the reader to
show that Eq. ( 140 ) is recovered by taking the partial trace (over
@xmath ) of Eq. ( 141 ) . This is actually the most common way of
describing the amplitude-damping channel. We presented the @xmath
-contained form of Eq. ( 140 ) to emphasize that we are interested in
treating the evolution of @xmath , not of @xmath , and that the
auxiliary system @xmath is, as far as this treatment is concerned, a
tool which we take full liberty to explore.

The evolution of this purification is given by the following unitary
operator on @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (142)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath are raising and lowering operators of qubit @xmath ( @xmath
, @xmath , @xmath ), and analogously for @xmath on @xmath . The
Hamiltonian for this evolution (corrected for initial-state averaging)
is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (143)
  -- -------- -- -------

from which we obtain the bound @xmath on the quantum Fisher information:

  -- -- -- -------
           (144)
  -- -- -- -------

where the variance is calculated in the initial state of @xmath (hence
the expectation value @xmath is to be calculated in the initial state of
@xmath ). The corresponding bound on evolution time is given by

  -- -- -- -------
           (145)
  -- -- -- -------

A first result is that if the initial state of @xmath is @xmath , the
bound shows exactly that the distance @xmath remains zero, as it must
according to Eq. ( 141a ). Furthermore, if @xmath is a monotonic
(decreasing) function of @xmath , integration can be performed at once
and yields

  -- -- -- -------
           (146)
  -- -- -- -------

An example is the exponential damping @xmath , for which

  -- -- -- -------
           (147)
  -- -- -- -------

or

  -- -- -- -------
           (148)
  -- -- -- -------

If system @xmath is initially in state @xmath , the expectation value
@xmath and the bound is saturated, since for this case @xmath , see
Eq. ( 146 ). We can draw a couple of conclusions from this fact.
Firstly, saturation implies that @xmath above is the minimum over
different purifications for initial states @xmath or @xmath , i.e.
@xmath . This is, in fact, an exception: we see in the next Subsections
that the first, most intuitive purification does not usually yield the
minimum, and an optimization must be performed.

Secondly, saturation implies that the path from @xmath to @xmath through
mixed states of Fig. 5 is a geodesic. We have seen in Section Geometric
Approach that great circles of the Bloch sphere are the geodesics
between two orthogonal states; the inclusion of mixed states adds this
path (among others) to the set. We should also note that the geometry of
the Bures angle is radically different from the usual, Euclidean
geometry on the Bloch sphere, since both a diameter and a great
semi-circle have here the same length (as shown in Fig. 5 ).

Another feature of the result is that the bound saturates for any
monotonic @xmath . This is a manifestation of the geometric nature of
the bound, since varying @xmath among monotonic functions can be
understood as a rescaling of the time parameter, still on the route of
Fig. 5 . A non-monotonic @xmath would imply going back and forth along
the path, which cannot constitute a geodesic, and the bound is no longer
saturated.

A special case of this channel is a two-level atom interacting with an
external field modeled by the resonant Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian when
there is only one quantum of energy in the compound system. If we take
the atom to be system @xmath and the external field as @xmath , the
interaction is given by @xmath , @xmath being a coupling constant. Eq. (
141 ) is obeyed with @xmath up to the first root of @xmath , which is
the relevant short-time regime for speed limits. The bound is then also
saturated, since it predicts

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (149)
  -- -------- -- -------

#### Single-qubit dephasing

We now present an interaction typically used to describe the generation
of decoherence, the dephasing. In this Markov evolution, a qubit (system
@xmath ) loses information on the relative phase between its @xmath and
@xmath components. This channel can arise physically when a system
interacts with many external degrees of freedom without energy loss. An
example is a particle scattering off of many different atoms in a
medium, with each scattering being elastic. Energy is a constant of
motion, but the relative phase accumulated between the energy
eigenstates depends on the time during which scattering took place. This
time is usually not known (partly because it is a function of the
precise path in physical space traveled by the particle, which is also
unknown), hence there is a gradual loss of phase information.

The system Hamiltonian is @xmath , with @xmath being the Pauli operator
on @xmath ( @xmath , @xmath ) and analogously for @xmath , @xmath . The
evolution can be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (150)
  -- -------- -- -------

where, in addition to the Hamiltonian term ( @xmath ), there is a term
proportional to @xmath modeling the loss of phase information. In terms
of the Bloch sphere, the term in @xmath is responsible for a rotation
around the @xmath -axis, whereas the term in @xmath reduces the @xmath ,
@xmath components of the vector, or the distance from the vector to the
@xmath -axis. The trajectory is contained in a plane perpendicular to
the @xmath -axis, and the expectation value @xmath is constant
throughout the motion, see Fig. 6 . For sufficiently long times, the
state is an incoherent mixture of @xmath , @xmath . It is customary to
treat the dephasing channel in the interaction picture so that the
Hamiltonian part of the evolution (rotation around the @xmath -axis)
does not manifest itself in the state of the system, but it is not licit
to do so in our problem for the reasons pointed out on p. Main concepts
and existing literature .

Let us now introduce a purification describing the dephasing channel.
The auxiliary system @xmath once again only needs to be a qubit. With
the initial state of @xmath assumed pure, @xmath can be initially
separable, and hence the initial state of @xmath can be chosen to be
@xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (151a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (151b)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

with ²⁸ ²⁸ 28 It is left once again as an exercise to the reader to show
that Eq. ( 150 ) is recovered by taking the partial trace (over @xmath )
of Eq. ( 151 ) and deriving the resulting @xmath with respect to time.
@xmath . The purity of the initial state of @xmath poses no restriction,
since, in this channel, every evolution starting in a mixed state of
@xmath can be seen as part of a longer evolution (starting earlier in
time) from a pure state.

The matching evolution operator on @xmath is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (152)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a Pauli operator acting on qubit @xmath . The
corresponding Hamiltonian corrected for initial-state averaging is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (153)
  -- -------- -- -------

The bound @xmath on the quantum Fisher information obtained from this
@xmath is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (154)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the variance of @xmath , again to be evaluated in the
initial state of @xmath . A quantum speed limit can already be obtained
from it, but this is just one of the many possible purifications of this
channel; any additional unitary operator @xmath applied to the
right-hand side of Eq. ( 151 ) maintains its partial trace unaltered. To
minimize @xmath over different purifications, we have to minimize the
variance of @xmath from Eq. ( 139 ) over all possible operators @xmath .
Since @xmath is a qubit, we only need to minimize over all Hermitian
@xmath operators, which can in general be written in terms of the Pauli
operators and the identity. Furthermore, the addition of an identity
does not affect the variance of an operator, so that, for our purposes,
the most general form of @xmath is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (155)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , @xmath , @xmath are real parameters to minimize over, and
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath are Pauli operators acting on qubit @xmath .
This minimization is performed in Appendix Optimization of the bound for
the dephasing channel , and the result is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (156)
  -- -------- -- -------

dependent on the initial-state variance @xmath of @xmath . This leads to
the following implicit bound on @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (157)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the standard deviation of @xmath .

A first feature of the bound is that it correctly portrays the
non-evolution of eigenstates of @xmath . Moreover, in the two extreme
cases @xmath or @xmath , Eq. ( 157 ) reduces to simple analytical
expressions. For the former, the evolution becomes once again unitary,
and the Mandelstam-Tamm bound is recovered [compare Eq. ( 7 )]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (158)
  -- -------- -- -------

For the latter, the bound reduces to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (159)
  -- -------- -- -------

from which one sees that the distance from initial to final states
cannot exceed @xmath . Equivalently, we can write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (160)
  -- -------- -- -------

The bound can be saturated in this “pure-dephasing” ( @xmath ) case:
this happens when the initial state of the system is on the equator of
the Bloch sphere ( @xmath ), for which the bound yields

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (161)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the actual value of @xmath is indeed @xmath .

We can also analyze the asymptotic behavior of the bound for @xmath .
Integration of Eq. ( 157 ) over the region @xmath arrives at the
elliptic integral of the second kind ²⁹ ²⁹ 29 We adopt the notation
where the second argument @xmath is the so-called parameter of the
elliptic integral in all occurrences of @xmath . @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (162)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath . Given the way the bound has been constructed, a bound for
@xmath serves as bound for the distance at any other time @xmath . In
Fig. 7 we have plotted the bound for @xmath for @xmath , an expression
bounding the distance at any time and for any initial state. From this
graph, we see that, analogously to Eq. ( 159 ), the bound guarantees
that orthogonal states are not reachable in finite time for certain
values of @xmath , namely @xmath (compare the amplitude-damping channel,
where @xmath evolves to @xmath ).

The integral in the general result on Eq. ( 157 ) is in fact solvable in
terms of elliptic integrals of the second kind @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (163)
  -- -------- -- -------

In Fig. 8 , we plot the relative discrepancy between the bound and the
distance as calculated exactly from its evolution. The exact distance in
the dephasing channel obeys

  -- -- -- -------
           (164)
  -- -- -- -------

and we see that the bound remains close to the exact result up to the
first minimum of the latter, which is the region of interest for quantum
speed limits. This is a display of the usefulness of the bound even when
it is not strictly tight.

#### Dephasing and entanglement

Another display of the usefulness of the bound lies in the discussion of
the relation between entanglement and quantum evolution time. This issue
concerns quantum systems composed of many ( @xmath ) subsystems and
consists in understanding the interplay between correlations among the
subsystems (especially entanglement) and the speed of evolution of the
system as a whole.

##### Established results for unitary evolutions

Several works [ 45 , 52 , 54 , 55 , 56 , 58 ] have shown that in unitary
evolutions entanglement is a resource that allows for a speed-up of
quantum evolution. Let us then compare the speed of separable and
entangled states. We assume that the subsystems do not interact among
themselves in order to guarantee that no entanglement is created in the
initially separable states.

We begin by applying the quantum speed limit to a separable pure state
in a unitary evolution, as done in [ 45 ] . Let us assume the bound
saturates for some time @xmath for the whole state,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (165)
  -- -------- -- -------

Each subsystem @xmath has fidelity @xmath compared to its initial state
and energy spread @xmath , with @xmath and @xmath . Now, the quantum
speed limit can be applied to each subsystem, such that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (166)
  -- -------- -- -------

and, inserting Eq. ( 165 ) into Eq. ( 166 ),

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (167)
  -- -------- -- -------

Moving @xmath to the left-hand side, squaring and summing on @xmath ,
one finds

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (168)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath was also used. But a property of the function @xmath is
that it is subadditive in the sense that the left-hand side of the above
must be less than or equal to the right-hand side ³⁰ ³⁰ 30 The relation
@xmath for @xmath can be proven first for two variables and then by
induction. For two variables, one can use that, for any given value of
@xmath , equality holds for @xmath and that the derivative of the
left-hand side is greater than that of the right-hand side for @xmath .
. The only solution for Eq. ( 168 ), then, is for equality to hold. But
the condition for equality is that all arguments @xmath except for a
single @xmath , for which @xmath . This means that a separable state
cannot reach the quantum speed limit unless only a single subsystem
evolves and the remaining are stationary. For mixed separable states,
@xmath , the same is true of each term @xmath of the decomposition [ 45
] .

In contrast, an @xmath -party Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state of
the form @xmath — an example of a fully entangled state — can reach the
quantum speed limit. Saturation occurs on an evolution under a
Hamiltonian @xmath with @xmath and @xmath being the eigenstates of
@xmath . This can be seen by taking @xmath , where @xmath is the @xmath
Pauli operator acting on qubit @xmath . One obtains @xmath , with @xmath
.

A measure of the speed-up due to entanglement is obtained by comparing,
for @xmath , the @xmath -dependence of the evolution time of states
symmetric on all subsystems. For our purposes, we assume each subsystem
has energy spread @xmath (unaffected by variation of @xmath ) and the
global Hamiltonian is of the form @xmath . For separable states, the
bound on each subsystem is tighter than that for the state as a whole,
so relation ( 165 ) is eclipsed by the more relevant relation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (169)
  -- -------- -- -------

where it was used that the fidelity for each subsystem relative to its
initial state equals @xmath . We then say that there is a @xmath scaling
of the time @xmath with the number of subsystems @xmath , where @xmath
is the time necessary to reach a certain distance (or fidelity). Every
separable state is limited by this scaling, there are states that reach
this bound, e.g., an initial state @xmath under @xmath . Note that the
scaling does not depend on the value of @xmath .

On the other hand, this scaling does not hold for entangled systems, the
GHZ state serves as a counterexample. It is symmetric in all subsystems
and, assuming the same evolution under @xmath , it obeys

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (170)
  -- -------- -- -------

with a clear @xmath scaling. The change in scaling from @xmath to @xmath
in going from separable to entangled states expresses the evolution
speed-up due to the presence of entanglement.

It can then be said that separable states are ‘‘slow’’ as compared to
the speed that entangled ones can reach ³¹ ³¹ 31 It should be noted that
entangled states are not necessarily fast, as can be seen by the
evolution of a fully entangled initial state @xmath under the same
@xmath as before. Assuming an even number of subsystems, this state does
not evolve at all. . Fröwis [ 58 ] has shown this shift in behavior in a
multi-qubit system by showing that the quantum Fisher information of a
unitary evolution of @xmath qubits is upper-bounded by @xmath for
separable states and by @xmath in general ³² ³² 32 The authors of [ 58 ]
and references therein assume dimensionless time units to arrive at a
dimensionless quantum Fisher information. The employment of @xmath with
dimension of time does not affect the scaling in any way, though. .
Inserting those upper bounds in our main quantum speed limit of Eq. ( 93
) demonstrates the change in scaling. This has also been discussed in [
45 , 52 ] , examples have been given in [ 54 , 55 , 56 ] . Let us see
how these scalings behave in a non-unitary evolution.

##### Non-unitary case: @xmath-qubit dephasing

We study the dephasing of @xmath qubits, each of them undergoing the
dephasing channel of Eq. ( 150 ) or Eq. ( 151 ). The auxiliary system is
also a set of @xmath qubits, and the only interaction between @xmath and
@xmath occurs between the @xmath -th qubit of @xmath and the @xmath -th
of @xmath .

The unitary operator describing our first purification is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (171)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a Pauli operator acting on the @xmath -th qubit of
@xmath , and @xmath , on the @xmath -th of @xmath . The corresponding
corrected Hamiltonian is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (172)
  -- -------- -- -------

and we must minimize the variance of

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (173)
  -- -------- -- -------

with respect to different @xmath . Minimizing over the complete set of
@xmath , composed of all Hermitian @xmath matrices, is impractical. We
optimize instead over a three-parameter family of operators, the choice
of which hinges on the symmetry of the system:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (174)
  -- -------- -- -------

This minimization is performed in Appendix Optimization of the bound for
the dephasing channel . The result is expressed in terms of the variance
@xmath and average @xmath of @xmath . We also define a parameter @xmath
. The minimum is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (175)
  -- -------- -- -------

where expectation values are to be taken on initial states.

The parameter @xmath is restricted to @xmath and acts as an indicator of
the degree of the correlations among the qubits of @xmath . A GHZ state
(full correlation between qubits) obeys @xmath ; for any separable
state, @xmath , with equality occurring for symmetric states. The value
@xmath can be attained by anticorrelated states of the form @xmath or
@xmath .

Let us then evaluate the @xmath behavior of the bound. We begin by
taking @xmath , which corresponds in general to an initial state of the
form @xmath . The bound then reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (176)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath . An equally general upper bound for @xmath leads to an
analytically expressible bound on @xmath . It is found by considering
@xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (177)
  -- -------- -- -------

Notice that the bound maintains its generality by making this
substitution, but becomes less tight. Solving for @xmath , we find

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (178)
  -- -------- -- -------

which, for @xmath , leads to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (179)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the @xmath behavior is explicit. There is an alternative estimate
yielding a better approximation of the integral in Eq. ( 176 ), obtained
in the @xmath limit:

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (180)
              @xmath      (181)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Expanding for high values of @xmath , one obtains

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (182)
  -- -------- -- -------

which not only shows the @xmath dependence, but also produces a very
good fit of the numerically calculated bound, see Fig. 9 .

The @xmath behavior for @xmath can also be corroborated by an exact
calculation with an initial GHZ state @xmath . This yields

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (183)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the @xmath scaling is clear from the joint dependence on the
product @xmath , even if solving for @xmath is not trivial.

In summary, the fully entangled states found by setting @xmath present,
on this non-unitary channel, a behavior analogous to that of unitary
evolutions, namely, it is capable of a “fast” evolution @xmath . Let us
now turn to the evolution of separable states under this same channel.

Any separable state has @xmath , where equality occurs for separable
states symmetric on all qubits (more generally, for states such that
@xmath for every @xmath ). We take @xmath as our paradigm for separable
states. The bound in this case reads

  -- -- -- -------
           (184)
  -- -- -- -------

Notice that we write the initial-state dependence as @xmath ( @xmath )
because @xmath is now bounded by @xmath and we are interested in making
the @xmath -dependence explicit. The result is quite similar to that of
a single qubit, Eq. ( 163 ), except for a factor @xmath (notice that for
a single qubit @xmath ).

We plot in Fig. 10 the bound on the time needed to arrive at a @xmath
fidelity relative to the initial state (equivalently, @xmath ) as a
function of @xmath . We observe a striking result: the @xmath dependence
is not the same for all values of @xmath . By the change of slope on the
logarithmic graph, it is clear that there are two different power laws
and a transition between them.

We can find asymptotic expressions to better understand this behavior.
The steeper slope can be fitted by expanding Eq. ( 184 ) to lowest order
in @xmath and solving for @xmath (equivalent to the @xmath limit, since
@xmath is unequivocally decreasing),

  -- -- -- -------
           (185)
  -- -- -- -------

which shows the @xmath dependence for @xmath . As in Fig. 10 , the
asymptotes are the same for every @xmath . To obtain the other
asymptotic limit, one should notice that for a less slanted region to
appear @xmath must be sufficiently high. Taking the @xmath limit in
Eq. ( 184 ), one finds

  -- -- -- -------
           (186)
  -- -- -- -------

We can still use @xmath , which then yields

  -- -- -- -------
           (187)
  -- -- -- -------

exhibiting a @xmath behavior. We can also estimate when the transition
between the two behaviors occurs as when the two expansions of Eqs. (
185 , 187 ) coincide. This corresponds to

  -- -- -- -------
           (188)
  -- -- -- -------

which amounts to a @xmath scaling. Eqs. ( 185 , 187 ) are the asymptotes
shown in Fig. 10 .

We have thus shown that for separable states the relation @xmath given
by the bound presents two different behaviors. For @xmath , the bound
exhibits a “slow” @xmath relation, but as @xmath increases there is a
transition to a “fast” @xmath dependence, achieved when @xmath . This is
remarkably different from the unitary case, where no separable state
presents such a “fast” evolution. An important advantage of the bound is
that it is able to present such result in a more general manner,
independent of initial state. Such “fast” evolutions are of interest and
could have potential applications in fields such as computation. A
non-unitary reset operation that is fast independently of initial-state
entanglement can be of great use in this area.

To corroborate even further the result, we have selected a specific
initial state to calculate exact results for @xmath and compare to our
bound, namely, the state @xmath . Fig. 11 displays the bound for
separable states together with exact calculations. It shows that our
bound is capable of depicting important features of the quantum systems
at hand even without being saturated. We note that the bound correctly
predicts not only the twofold behavior of @xmath , but the scaling of
@xmath at which the transition between the different slopes takes place.

The exact calculations for @xmath , @xmath , yield

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (189)
  -- -------- -- -------

which can be rewritten and expanded as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (190)
  -- -------- -- -------

The two regimes can be seen in the above equation: for @xmath and @xmath
, the first term of the left-hand side is dominant, yielding a @xmath
dependence; for smaller values of @xmath , higher values of @xmath
(still obeying @xmath and @xmath ) and @xmath , the second term is
dominant, and @xmath . The asymptotes of Fig. 11 are the @xmath
relations obtained taking only the first or the second term of the
left-hand side of Eq. ( 190 ) above. We can estimate when the transition
occurs by finding the value of @xmath that leads to equal contributions
from both terms, which is @xmath . The corresponding value of @xmath is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (191)
  -- -------- -- -------

confirming the @xmath scaling.

In summary, we have applied our main bound, Eq. ( 93 ), to three
different quantum non-unitary evolutions: the amplitude-damping channel,
the single-qubit dephasing and the multi-qubit dephasing. The first of
these showed an example of an evolution on a mixed-state geodesic
connecting pure states, illustrating nontrivial aspects of mixed-state
geometry. As a path through a geodesic, it also exemplifies the
saturation of the bound. Next, the single-qubit dephasing was able to
yield a relation, the bound on @xmath , which restricted the possibility
of a system becoming orthogonal in general grounds, independent of
initial state and valid for any finite time. It also served as a case to
demonstrate how the optimization procedure is performed. Lastly, the
@xmath -qubit dephasing allowed for the discussion of the interplay
between entanglement and evolution speed, produced nontrivial results
and showed that non-unitary evolution can be radically different from
the usual unitary intuition.

### Application of the additional bound

We end this Chapter presenting an application of our additional,
median-based bound of Section Additional results , Eqs. ( 123 , 125 ).
This bound, valid for pure states evolving unitarily, is applied to a
three-level state, initially in

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (192)
  -- -------- -- -------

with the governing Hamiltonian @xmath . If the median @xmath , the
result reduces to a Margolus-Levitin bound, in the sense that it depends
on the average energy respective to the ground state. If @xmath , the
average energy is taken respective to the highest energy level, but the
resulting expression is still analogous to a Margolus-Levitin bound.
More interesting is the intermediate case @xmath . We set @xmath in
order to guarantee this value of the median. There is then only one
relevant free parameter, the value of @xmath (since @xmath ).

Let us first examine the version of the bound dependent on @xmath ,
Eq. ( 122 ). In this case, @xmath , and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (193)
  -- -------- -- -------

This bound is always surpassed by the Mandelstam-Tamm bound for the same
evolution,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (194)
  -- -------- -- -------

but can often beat the Margolus-Levitin bound on the time to become
orthogonal, @xmath . The three are plotted in Fig. 12 for @xmath , which
is the value for which Eq. ( 193 ) presents the best results. Also
plotted is the fidelity as by exact calculations, which yield

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (195)
  -- -------- -- -------

A tighter result is attained with the second version of the median-based
bound, dependent on @xmath . We have, for this three-state evolution,

  -- -- -- -------
           (196)
  -- -- -- -------

and the bound of Eq. ( 125 ), obtained by integration, is expressed in
terms of elliptic integrals of the second kind @xmath :

  -- -- -- -------
           (197)
  -- -- -- -------

This version is actually competitive with both the Mandelstam-Tamm and
Margolus-Levitin bounds: for certain values of @xmath , it is the best
of the three, as shown in Fig. 13 . This happens in the vicinity of
@xmath , value at which the bound is saturated throughout the evolution.
We note that for @xmath Eq. ( 197 ) is indefinite, but the bound is
well-defined and reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (198)
  -- -------- -- -------

This application shows that the additional result of Section Additional
results has the potential to lead to useful bounds on evolution times.
Although still restricted to unitary evolutions, it has been able to
overcome the previously known bounds on certain occasions. The
analytically demonstrated saturation at @xmath above for all times up to
becoming orthogonal is a feat that has not been achieved with
Margolus-Levitin-like bounds. This median-based results may be a path
for a more structured derivation, possibly geometric, of a general bound
encompassing that of Margolus and Levitin.

## Final comments and perspectives

We have in this thesis developed different quantum speed limits, which
are bounds on how fast a quantum system can evolve.

In the Introduction, besides presenting motivations for this study, we
took the time to discern bounds on evolution time from energy-time
uncertainty relations, which share similar mathematical expressions, but
relate to conceptually different assertions.

We performed in Chapter Main concepts and existing literature a review
of the literature on the subject prior to our contributions. We
presented the two paradigmatic quantum speed limits, the Mandelstam-Tamm
bound and and the Margolus-Levitin bound, the most easily noticeable
difference between them being that the former relies on the energy
variance of the state and the latter, on the average energy. Another
important distinction is that the former is established in a more
complete quantum-mechanical framework than the latter.

Chapter Quantum Speed Limits for General Physical Processes is the
central chapter of this work, in which we derived our novel results. We
first introduced some of the standard quantum-informational tools in
Section Useful quantum information tools . In Section Geometric Approach
we defined and developed a geometric structure for pure quantum states,
culminating in a distance measure for this set and in a reinterpretation
of the Mandelstam-Tamm bound on geometric foundations, with practical
gains especially with regard to the issue of saturation of the bound.
Section Fisher information was dedicated to presenting the Fisher
information, both “classical” and quantum. The core of this thesis is
found in Section The most general quantum speed limit , where we derived
the main result, the general bound on evolution times of Eq. ( 93 ),
valid for non-unitary as well as unitary evolutions. The greatest
novelty of this finding is to extend the Mandelstam-Tamm bound to
non-unitary evolutions, a feat deemed impossible on at least one
occasion [ 49 ] . We were also able to preserve important features such
as clear conditions for saturation. Additional bounds, based on the
median of the energy distribution, were introduced in Section Additional
results . They are still restricted to unitary evolutions and can be
considered as a work in progress, but are relevant candidates for future
developments.

Applications of the bounds to physical situations are the subject of
Chapter Applying the bounds . It nevertheless starts with a development
for calculating the quantum Fisher information based on purifications,
central to the application of our main bound. We saw examples displaying
saturation along with useful bounds even when not saturated. We were
also able to make use of the bound to discuss the interplay between
entanglement of a multipartite system and the speed of its evolution,
achieving nontrivial results for non-unitary channels fundamentally
distinct from their unitary counterparts.

There have been other results on the quantum speed limit for non-unitary
processes after our work had been developed, but prior to the writing of
this thesis. We discuss their properties and shortcomings in Appendix
Later results in the literature .

We mention two main perspectives for future work. We are of the opinion
that the Margolus-Levitin bound is founded, at this moment, on less than
ideal grounds. To be able to derive it as a consequence of a more
structured framework, possibly entailing a clearer interpretation of its
meaning, would be a considerable achievement. We believe that the
median-based bound presented in Section Additional results is a
potential candidate for arriving at such a derivation, since it reduces
to the Margolus-Levitin bound in some scenarios and stems from geometric
considerations.

The other perspective is the quantum brachistochrone problem, which
consists in finding the fastest route from a quantum state to another
given a set of allowed paths, or equivalently, given a set of
restrictions. This problem is of direct practical importance and is
closely related to quantum speed limits. One of the basic results of
this topic is that if restriction is placed only on the available
energy, the solution saturates the bound on evolution times [ 67 ] . We
feel that the experience with the geometry of quantum states and
optimization procedures gained along the present Ph.D. course will be of
great help towards this goal.

## Integration of the Fubini-Study metric

We here perform the integration in two-dimensional Hilbert space of the
differential form of the Fubini-Study metric from Eq. ( 38 ),

  -- -- -- -------
           (199)
  -- -- -- -------

to find the finite Fubini-Study distance between two states, as
mentioned on p. 39 . Just as in Chapter Quantum Speed Limits for General
Physical Processes , we denote by @xmath and @xmath the initial and
final states, respectively, and @xmath will be a state orthogonal to
@xmath so that @xmath belongs to the span of @xmath . Any evolution
between these states can be parametrized as in Eq. ( 39 ) by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (200)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a parameter and @xmath and @xmath are complex functions
of it, with @xmath . None of the states mentioned need to be normalized,
so there is no constraint on @xmath other than @xmath (in other words,
we only demand @xmath , not equality).

The variation @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (201)
  -- -------- -- -------

while the product @xmath is

  -- -- -- -------
           (202)
  -- -- -- -------

where the overdot represents derivation with respect to @xmath .
Substituting in the expression for @xmath , making the change of
variables @xmath , @xmath and taking the square root, we obtain

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (203)
  -- -------- -- -------

The numerator can be written as the derivative of the quotient @xmath ,

  -- -- -- -------
           (204)
  -- -- -- -------

With the change of variables @xmath (note that @xmath ), the length of
the path in the projective space according to the Fubini-Study metric is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (205)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the path of integration is specified by @xmath , and @xmath
corresponds to state @xmath . Setting @xmath , @xmath , we see that this
is in fact the line integral of @xmath on the complex plane, since
@xmath ; see Fig. 14 . In other words, the integration of the
Fubini-Study metric has been mapped onto a line integral on the complex
plane equipped with a Euclidean metric @xmath .

In order to find the distance, we need to find the path between @xmath
and @xmath yielding the minimal length @xmath . Due to the radial
symmetry of the problem, it is intuitive to consider the straight line
in the complex plane as yielding the minimum. This intuition can be
confirmed by the fact that the radial straight line is the shortest path
between the endpoints of the complex plane (in Euclidean metric!) and at
the same time the path of steepest descent of the integrand throughout –
the second assertion is due to the radial gradient thereof.

Alternatively, this minimization can be performed by standard calculus
of variations. Let @xmath be a parametrization of the path for some
parameter @xmath . The length we wish to minimize is then written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (206)
  -- -------- -- -------

for fixed initial and final points, where the overdot now represents
derivation with respect to @xmath . The Euler equation for this
minimization problem reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (207)
  -- -------- -- -------

and it is straightforward to see that the straight line through the
origin, @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , where @xmath is a constant, is a
solution to the above.

For the outward straight line we then have @xmath , and

  -- -- -- -------
           (208)
  -- -- -- -------

which can be rewritten as

  -- -- -- -------
           (209)
  -- -- -- -------

But the (normalized) inner product between initial and final states
reads

  -- -- -- -------
           (210)
  -- -- -- -------

and we conclude that

  -- -- -- -------
           (211)
  -- -- -- -------

as displayed in Eq. ( 40 ) of the main text.

Moreover, we now know that the geodesic is the straight line from the
origin to @xmath . Expressed in terms of @xmath , it reads @xmath ,
where @xmath is any nondecreasing real function of @xmath such that
@xmath and @xmath . Any condition imposed on @xmath will ignore, as it
should, the overall phase and normalization of the state. When written
in terms of @xmath , @xmath , the condition for the geodesic is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (212)
  -- -------- -- -------

from which one sees that on the geodesic the relative phase between the
components must be constant and the ratio of their moduli must not
decrease during evolution.

## Minimization yielding the median

We have the task of minimizing the function of Eq. ( 120 ),

  -- -- -- -------
           (213)
  -- -- -- -------

with respect to the real parameter @xmath , given the set of energies
@xmath and the probability distribution @xmath .

The first step is to notice that this function tends to infinity if
@xmath , but is bounded from below because it is non-negative, so the
minimum exists. This expression is, as a function of @xmath ,
sectionally linear. This can be seen best by taking the derivative with
respect to @xmath , which gives

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (214)
  -- -------- -- -------

The derivative is ill-defined when @xmath for some value of @xmath . A
graph of the function is shown in Fig. 15 . It is linear in each section
in which @xmath is between two consecutive values of @xmath . Notice
that the slope of the function always increases from one section to the
other, since the increase of @xmath can only remove a term from the
second summation in Eq. ( 214 ) and add it to the first.

The point where the slope goes from negative to positive is where the
minimum of this function is achieved. This corresponds to the energy
@xmath such that the probability of all energies below @xmath is less
than one half, @xmath and, at the same time, the probability of all
energies above @xmath is also less than one half, @xmath . This value
@xmath is, by definition, the median of the energy distribution, @xmath
.

However, there may not be a single point where the function goes from
decreasing to increasing. This happens when there is a value of @xmath
such that the probability of all energies below @xmath exactly equals
one half as well as that of all energies above @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (215)
  -- -------- -- -------

The corresponding graph has a section of slope zero, as in Fig. 16 .

The usual definition of the median in this case is the arithmetic
average of the two values closest to the null slope. Since our function
is constant in this interval, this value is one of those which yield the
minimum of our function. The minimum is achieved by @xmath also in this
case.

We can then state with no loss of generality that the minimum of Eq. (
120 ), or ( 213 ), is found when @xmath , and equals

  -- -- -- -------
           (216)
  -- -- -- -------

## Tightness of the bound on the quantum Fisher information

We have shown in Section Calculating the quantum Fisher information that
there is an upper bound on the quantum Fisher information @xmath of a
system @xmath in state @xmath based on the purification of this state

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (217)
  -- -------- -- -------

In this Appendix, we show that this bound, @xmath , can be saturated.
@xmath is nothing more than the quantum Fisher information of a
purification @xmath of @xmath into a larger system @xmath . We must then
show that there is a purification of @xmath such that @xmath .

We start by considering the Bures fidelity of two states @xmath and
@xmath . We know from Uhlmann’s theorem, Eq. ( 31 ), that for any
purification @xmath of the former there is a purification @xmath of the
latter such that

  -- -- -- -------
           (218)
  -- -- -- -------

Let us expand both sides of this equation on @xmath around @xmath . The
left-hand side has been expanded in Eq. ( 68 ) of the main text,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (219)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath , while the expansion of the right-hand side yields

  -- -- -- -------
           (220)
  -- -- -- -------

where we have omitted the subscript @xmath for cleanness. The zero-order
coefficient is simply the inner product squared, @xmath , and it must
equal one, since this is the value of the Bures fidelity between state
@xmath and itself. In fact, the unit value of @xmath in this case allows
us to write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (221)
  -- -------- -- -------

The higher-order terms are

  -- -------- -- -- -------
     @xmath         (222)
                    (223)
  -- -------- -- -- -------

and, by using Eq. ( 221 ), these simplify to

  -- -------- -- -- -------
     @xmath         (224)
                    (225)
  -- -------- -- -- -------

The normalization of @xmath implies that the first and second
derivatives of @xmath are zero, so that the first-order term of Eq. (
224 ) is null and substitution of Eq. ( 225 ) into Eq. ( 220 ) gives, up
to second order,

  -- -- -- -------
           (226)
  -- -- -- -------

The evolution of @xmath (reinserting the subscript!) is unitary, since
this state is always pure. Considering that its derivative can be
written in terms of the Hamiltonian @xmath as @xmath , the expansion up
to second order becomes

  -- -- -- -------
           (227)
  -- -- -- -------

where @xmath is the variance of @xmath . From the comparison of the two
expansions, Eqs. ( 219 , 227 ), we can ascertain that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (228)
  -- -------- -- -------

i.e., there is a purification @xmath of @xmath such that the quantum
Fisher information of the two ( @xmath and @xmath , respectively)
coincide. Since the former is an upper bound to the latter, @xmath is
the minimum over purifications:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (229)
  -- -------- -- -------

Since the equality on Uhlmann’s theorem requires the auxiliary system to
have the same dimension as the original, that is the requirement for
equality to hold for this bound.

## Optimization of the bound for the dephasing channel

In this Appendix, we minimize the bound @xmath for the dephasing
channel. This is done directly in the @xmath -qubit case. The
single-qubit case is recovered by taking @xmath , an independent
derivation thereof can also serve as an exercise to the reader.

We are tasked with minimizing the initial-state variance of

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (230)
  -- -------- -- -------

over the three-parameter family of Eq. ( 174 ), where the quantities
have been defined along Chapter Applying the bounds in Eqs. ( 136 , 138
, 139 ), see also the table on p. 1 . For @xmath , this represents a
minimization over all possible purifications. It is straightforward to
show that this variance can be cast in the form

  -- -- -- -------
           (231)
  -- -- -- -------

with @xmath (for any operator @xmath , @xmath denotes its variance).

Let @xmath be the initial state of @xmath . From @xmath of Eq. ( 172 ),

  -- -- -- -------
           (232)
  -- -- -- -------

with @xmath , and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (233)
  -- -------- -- -------

From Eqs. ( 174 , 171 ), one obtains

  -- -- -- -------
           (234)
  -- -- -- -------

where @xmath , and

  -- -- -- -------
           (235)
  -- -- -- -------

From the previous equations,

  -- -- -- -------
           (236)
  -- -- -- -------

and @xmath , according to ( 231 ), is the sum of ( 233 ), ( 235 ), and (
236 ),

  -- -- -- -------
           (237)
  -- -- -- -------

One now minimizes over @xmath , @xmath , @xmath for each @xmath . From
@xmath , one finds

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (238)
  -- -------- -- -------

Conditions @xmath and @xmath lead to a linear system of equations, with
solutions

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (239)
     @xmath               (240)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath . By replacing Eqs. ( 238 , 239 , 240 ) into Eq. ( 237 ),
one finds

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (241)
  -- -------- -- -------

as in Eq. ( 175 ). The single-qubit result of Eq. ( 156 ) is recovered
by taking @xmath (notice that @xmath in this case).

## Later results in the literature

After the completion and submission to publication of our work, other
authors have also derived bounds on non-unitary evolution. We now
comment on these results.

In [ 113 ] , a work subsequent to ours both in publication as preprint
and submission to a refereed journal, del Campo and collaborators have
also obtained bounds on non-unitary evolutions. Their bounds, albeit
technically correct, lack some of the interesting features of our
results.

Firstly, although they recognize that the well-established Bures
fidelity @xmath would be the natural choice [ 113 , p.1] , del Campo et
alli base their comparison of initial and final states — @xmath and
@xmath , respectively — on a figure of merit

     @xmath      (242)
  -- -------- -- -------

without justification other than its past employment on pure states
and/or unitary evolutions. We note that for pure states evolving
unitarily both @xmath and @xmath above — as well as many other possible
functions — recover the pure-state fidelity @xmath . The figure of merit
@xmath above does yield @xmath for orthogonal states and @xmath for
coinciding ones, but a meaning for its intermediate values has not been
offered ³³ ³³ 33 It would seem particularly telling of the arbitrariness
of this figure of merit that on a different section of the same paper [
113 , Eq. (10)] , a different function @xmath is used for the same
purpose. Comparing the main text of [ 113 ] with its supplemental
material, though, we are inclined to pardon this different version of
@xmath as a typo. .

Another shortcoming of their result is that neither of their two bounds
can be saturated in a non-unitary evolution, because their derivation
either makes use of @xmath or of a Cauchy-Schwarz inequality whose
saturation occurs only if @xmath , and saturation of either bound at
time @xmath would require either @xmath or @xmath for all @xmath .
Considering that the novelty of general bounds is their application to
non-unitary processes, such a limitation severely restricts the
potential usefulness of the result in [ 113 ] .

On the other hand, even when confined to unitary evolutions and pure
states, the bound does not fare much better. The authors agree that a
bound should reduce to the Mandelstam-Tamm bound in this case; their
results fail to do so. Their bounds, applied to a unitary evolution of
pure states, yield orthogonalization ³⁴ ³⁴ 34 For non-orthogonal final
states, the bounds in [ 113 ] fare even worse . times @xmath and @xmath
, more than a factor of @xmath worse than the tight Mandelstam-Tamm
bound, @xmath . In light of this reasoning, the claim of the authors of
[ 113 ] of generalizing the Mandelstam-Tamm bound seems inappropriate.

A last comment on this paper is that a confusing notation is used. Their
bounds are implicit on time @xmath , just as Eq. ( 16 ) or Eq. ( 93 ).
Each of their results can be schematically cast into the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (243)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the integrand is determined by the evolution and is
time-dependent, and the right-hand side is some function of the figure
of merit @xmath at final time @xmath . The bounds are implicit because
the integrand is time-dependent and integration can only be performed
for each specific evolution. The authors nevertheless choose to multiply
by @xmath in order to express this in terms of a time average @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (244)
  -- -------- -- -------

This apparent explicitation of @xmath on the left-hand side and its
omission on the denominator on the right-hand side have proven to be
quite confusing. It can lead to the interpretation that the right-hand
side be a bound on time @xmath , whereas it actually depends on @xmath .
We have come across researchers in the very field of Quantum Information
who have been mislead by this notation, and we believe that it should be
avoided completely.

Another article published after our results was that of Deffner and Lutz
in [ 114 ] . Although it has advantages over [ 113 ] , it shares some of
the criticism above. The authors here make use of the actual fidelity
between initial and final states, restricting themselves to pure initial
states. The alleged generalization of both Margolus-Levitin (ML) and
Mandelstam-Tamm (MT) bounds is not achieved. As for the ML bound, there
is a technical flaw in the relation that links the average energy to one
of the obtained bounds. Applying the general bound to a unitary
evolution under Hamiltonian @xmath , the relation also depends on the
state @xmath at time @xmath and reads

  -- -- -- -------
           (245)
  -- -- -- -------

claimed to be valid for @xmath having non-negative spectrum, see [ 114 ,
Eq. (10)] . The mistake is due to the fact that the product @xmath is
assumed Hermitian, which need not be the case. A simple counterexample
of a qubit in state @xmath under a Hamiltonian @xmath disproves the
relation. As such, the results of [ 114 ] have not been related to the
average energy, and no relation to the ML bound have been shown. As for
the claim of recovering the MT bound, the corresponding result, when
applied to a unitary evolution under a constant Hamiltonian, reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (246)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the fidelity between initial and final states. It
recovers one of the two bounds present in [ 113 ] . In spite of the
functional similarity to Eq. ( 16 ), the different prefactor and
functional dependence of Eq. ( 246 ) on @xmath imply a less tight bound,
which cannot be saturated in any case. The most central result of [ 114
] is a bound that is expressible in terms of the operator norm (even
when applied to unitary evolutions, it is expressible neither in terms
of average energy nor of energy variance, hence is fundamentally
different from ML or MT bounds). A purported advantage of this result is
that it would be sharper than the MT bound [ 114 , p.1] , but the
comparison is made not with the actual MT bound, but with the weaker
Eq. ( 246 ) and thus does not suffice to corroborate the relevance of
the result.

Saturation is observed numerically in some instances for this bound, but
it is shown to occur only for specific instants, not along an evolution.
Clear criteria for saturation are also lacking, as well as an
interpretation of the bound.

Deffner and Lutz also make use of the confusing notation illustrated in
Eq. ( 244 ); they go so far as to use a specific value of @xmath to
calculate the average on the right-hand side and treat the resulting
fraction as a bound on @xmath ! (See [ 114 , Fig. 1] , which is supposed
to be a plot of the bound on @xmath obtained by taking @xmath .) This
impedes a proper interpretation of their results. Only saturation can be
(cumbersomely) evaluated from their plots and it is, as mentioned, only
seen numerically for a specific value of @xmath . This serves as an
example of the damage done by the confusing choice of an apparently
explicit @xmath as in Eq. ( 244 ).
