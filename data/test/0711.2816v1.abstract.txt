This thesis has three goals related to the automorphism groups of finite
@xmath -groups. The primary goal is to provide a complete proof of a
theorem showing that, in some asymptotic sense, the automorphism group
of almost every finite @xmath -group is itself a @xmath -group. We
originally proved this theorem in a paper with Martin; the presentation
of the proof here contains omitted proof details and revised exposition.
We also give a survey of the extant results on automorphism groups of
finite @xmath -groups, focusing on the order of the automorphism groups
and on known examples. Finally, we explore a connection between
automorphisms of finite @xmath -groups and Markov chains. Specifically,
we define a family of Markov chains on an elementary abelian @xmath
-group and bound the convergence rate of some of those chains.
