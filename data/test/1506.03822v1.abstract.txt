The regularization of the CMB power spectrum is an important issue of
cosmology. Most approaches assume that there is no need to regularize
the power spectrum, while Parker advocated the new regularization
approach for the power spectrum in 2007 [ 1 ] : the adiabatic
regularization, which was originally developed for particle creation in
curved spacetime (see the review [ 2 ] ). This thesis focuses on this
issue, especially concerning adiabatic subtraction terms. The
subtraction terms for minimally coupled slow-roll inflation are well
known (see e.g. [ 1 ] ). We extend the view to more generic inflation
models, and derive the subtraction terms for k-inflation models. Via the
method of Urakawa–Starobinsky [ 3 ] , we consider the time development
of the subtraction term at late times. We also consider the
non-minimally coupled case, and show that the adiabatic regularization
is independent of the frame: Jordan or Einstein frames.

who provided tremendous support to my studies. I also greatly thank
Prof. Takahiro Kubota and Dr. Wade Naylor, whose meticulous feedback and
valuable comments greatly helped me. Dr. Naylor gave me such an
interesting theme and assisted to improve my English. I also benefited
from discussions with my collaborator Mr. Allan L. Alinea and would like
to show my gratitude to him as well.
