I define new zeta functions in a nonstandard setting and examine some of
their properties. I further develop @xmath -adic interpolation in the
nonstandard setting and define the concept of interpolation with respect
to two primes. The final section of the dissertation examines the work
of M. J. Shai Haran and makes initial attempts of viewing it from a
nonstandard perspective.
