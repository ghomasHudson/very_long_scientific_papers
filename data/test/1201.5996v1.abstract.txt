Uniform algebras have been extensively investigated because of their
importance in the theory of uniform approximation and as examples of
complex Banach algebras. An interesting question is whether analogous
algebras exist when a complete valued field other than the complex
numbers is used as the underlying field of the algebra. In the
Archimedean setting, this generalisation is given by the theory of real
function algebras introduced by S. H. Kulkarni and B. V. Limaye in the
1980s. This thesis establishes a broader theory accommodating any
complete valued field as the underlying field by involving Galois
automorphisms and using non-Archimedean analysis. The approach taken
keeps close to the original definitions from the Archimedean setting.
Basic function algebras are defined and generalise real function
algebras to all complete valued fields whilst retaining the obligatory
properties of uniform algebras.
Several examples are provided. A basic function algebra is constructed
in the non-Archimedean setting on a @xmath -adic ball such that the only
globally analytic elements of the algebra are constants.
Each basic function algebra is shown to have a lattice of basic
extensions related to the field structure. In the non-Archimedean
setting it is shown that certain basic function algebras have residue
algebras that are also basic function algebras.
A representation theorem is established. Commutative unital Banach
@xmath -algebras with square preserving norm and finite basic dimension
are shown to be isometrically @xmath -isomorphic to some subalgebra of a
Basic function algebra. The condition of finite basic dimension is
always satisfied in the Archimedean setting by the Gel’fand-Mazur
Theorem. The spectrum of an element is considered.
The theory of non-commutative real function algebras was established by
K. Jarosz in 2008. The possibility of their generalisation to the
non-Archimedean setting is established in this thesis and also appeared
in a paper by J. W. Mason in 2011.
In the context of complex uniform algebras, a new proof is given using
transfinite induction of the Feinstein-Heath Swiss cheese
“Classicalisation” theorem. This new proof also appeared in a paper by
J. W. Mason in 2010.
