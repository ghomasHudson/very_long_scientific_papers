The objective of this thesis is to present a viable extension of general
relativity free from cosmological singularities. A viable cosmology, in
this sense, is one that is free from ghosts, tachyons or exotic matter,
while staying true to the theoretical foundations of General Relativity
such as general covariance, as well as observed phenomenon such as the
accelerated expansion of the universe and inflationary behaviour at
later times. To this end, an infinite derivative extension of relativity
is introduced, with the gravitational action derived and the non-linear
field equations calculated, before being linearised around both
Minkowski space and de Sitter space. The theory is then constrained so
as to avoid ghosts and tachyons by appealing to the modified propagator,
which is also derived. Finally, the Raychaudhuri Equation is employed in
order to describe the ghost-free, defocusing behaviour around both
Minkowski and de Sitter spacetimes, in the linearised regime.
