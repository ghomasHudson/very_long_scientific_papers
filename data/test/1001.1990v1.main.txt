## Abstract

In this thesis we investigate quantum mechanical effects to various
aspects of gravitational collapse. These quantum mechanical effects are
implemented in the context of the Functional Schrödinger formalism. The
Functional Schrödinger formalism allows us to investigate the
time-dependent evolutions of the quantum mechanical effects, which is
beyond the scope of the usual methods used to investigate the quantum
mechanical corrections of gravitational collapse. Utilizing the
time-dependent nature of the Functional Schrödinger formalism, we study
the quantization of a spherically symmetric domain wall from the view
point of an asymptotic and infalling observer, in the absence of
radiation. To build a more realistic picture, we then study the
time-dependent nature of the induced radiation during the collapse using
a semi-classical approach. Using the domain wall and the induced
radiation, we then study the time-dependent evolution of the entropy of
the domain wall. Finally we make some remarks about the possible
inclusion of backreaction into the system.

## Chapter \thechapter Introduction

This thesis is based on work done in a series of nine papers, which have
been published in several different journals, see Refs. [ 30 , 31 , 32 ,
37 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 52 ] . The work here is varied and takes several
different aspects into account, however, for this thesis we concentrate
on only a subset of these papers. The subset of interest here are those
papers which include gravitational collapse of a massive shell only.
Even though this is only a subset of the possible parameters that a
black hole can have, this subset displays most of the interesting
features that illustrate the core of our work.

## Chapter \thechapter Formalism

The most important part of our research is the formalism used to study
the quantum mechanical effects of gravitational collapse. To study these
quantum effects of gravitational collapse we will institute the
Functional Schrödinger equation. In this part of the thesis we will
first derive the Functional Schrödinger equation, which will be the
primary equation used to study the quantum effects of gravitational
collapse.

The main purpose of the Functional Schödinger equation is to introduce
the “observer” time into the Wheeler-de Witt equation. It is well known
in General Relativity that for different foliations of space-time,
different physical observations occur. For example, one can consider the
equations of motion for a black hole. Let us consider an object which is
falling into a black hole from different points of view. If one chooses
the time as observed by an asymptotic observer as the desired foliation
of space-time, upon solving the equations of motion of the object, one
finds that it takes an infinite amount of time for the object to fall
into the black (even if the object is a photon). However, if one choses
the time as observed by a freely falling observer (one that is falling
into the black hole along a geodesic) as the desired foliation of
space-time, upon solving the equations of motion of the object in this
case, one finds that it takes a finite amount of time for the object to
fall into the black hole. Therefore, one can see that it is important
and instructive to consider different foliations of the space-time to
learn different aspects of the system of gravitational collapse. The
Functional Schrödinger equation allows for one to specify the particular
foliation of space-time that is of interest and study the system from
that view point.

A second purpose of the Functional Schrödinger equation is to allow one
to investigate the time evolution of the system. Typically this is not
done in the study of gravitational collapse. The preferred method of
study is to consider an initial static asymptotically flat space-time,
let the system evolve (with no knowledge of the evolution), then
consider a final different static asymptotically flat space-time. Then
by comparing these two different space-times, one can in principle have
some understanding of what the evolution was like between these two
events. The Functional Schrödinger equation will in principle allow us
to study the total time evolution of the system, not just the static
asymptotically flat regions of space-time.

### 1 Functional Schrödinger Equation

In this section we will derive the Functional Schrödinger equation.

The Wheeler-de Witt equation for a closed universe is given by, see Ref.
[ 1 ] ,

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (1)
  -- -------- -- -----

where @xmath is the total Hamiltonian and @xmath is the total
wavefunction for all the ingredients of the system, including the
observer’s degrees of freedom denoted by @xmath . Eq.( 1 ) is a
consequence of the idea that there is no “God” time, or no preferred
time, or no super-observer time. Therefore Eq.( 1 ) is written in a
gauge independent fashion, since there is no preferred observer to
observe the system.

In general we can write the wavefunction in Eq.( 1 ) as

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (2)
  -- -------- -- -----

Here @xmath describes the location of the wall as a function of the
internal wall world volume coordinates @xmath , @xmath is the metric,
and @xmath is a scalar field. The Roman indices go over the internal
domain wall world volume coordinates and the Greek indices go over
space-time coordinates. Note that the wavefunctional in Eq.( 2 ) is a
functional of the fields but not the space-time coordinates. In general,
the total Hamiltonian is a linear combination of the Hamiltonian of the
system itself and that of the Hamiltonian of the observer. Therefore we
will separate the Hamiltonian into two parts, one for the system and the
other for the observer, which can be written as

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (3)
  -- -------- -- -----

Any (weak) interaction terms between the observer and the
wall-metric-scalar system are included in @xmath . The observer is
assumed to not significantly affect the evolution of the system and vice
versa. In mathematical language this means that we are assuming that the
Hamiltonian for the system and the observer commute with each other

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (4)
  -- -------- -- -----

The total wavefunction Eq.( 2 ) can be written as a sum over eigenstates

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (5)
  -- -------- -- -----

where @xmath labels the eigenstates and @xmath are complex coefficients.

To solve the full Wheeler-de Witt equation is very difficult since it
involves all the degrees of freedom, both that of the system and the
observer. Here we shall utilize the frequently employed strategy of
truncating the field degrees of freedom to a finite subset, hence we
will be consider with the minsuperspace version of the Wheeler-de Witt
equation. As long as we keep all the relevant degrees of freedom that
are of interest, this is a useful truncation. Since we are only
considering a subset of the total degrees of freedom, this is now
considered an “open” system. In an “open” system, one can then define an
appropriate “observer” time in which one chooses to make measurements.
Therefore we can write the Schrödinger equation for the observation as

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (6)
  -- -------- -- -----

This is convenient, however, we wish to make observations on the system
not on the observer. To transform this to observation on the system we
will make use Eq.( 1 ).

To introduce the observer time on observations of the system, we use
Eq.( 1 ), Eq.( 5 ) and Eq.( 6 ), therefore we can write

  -- -------- -------- -- -----
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (7)
  -- -------- -------- -- -----

where we made use of Eq.( 3 ) and in the last line we used Eq.( 6 ).

Now consider the integral of the last term in Eq.( 7 ), we have

  -- -------- -------- -- -----
     @xmath               
              @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (8)
  -- -------- -------- -- -----

However, by virtue of the Wheeler-de Witt equation, the total
wavefunction @xmath is time-independent. Therefore the first term on the
right hand side in Eq.( 8 ) is zero. Shrinking the integral we then
have,

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (9)
  -- -------- -- -----

Substituting Eq.( 9 ) into Eq.( 7 ) we can then write,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (10)
  -- -------- -- ------

or interms of one @xmath value, we then arrive at the Functional
Schrödinger equation

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (11)
  -- -------- -- ------

For convenience, from now on we will denote the system wavefunction
simply by @xmath and drop the superscript @xmath and the subscript
“sys”. Similarly @xmath will now denote @xmath , and the Schrödinger
equation reads

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (12)
  -- -------- -- ------

### 2 Discussion

Here we have derived the Functional Schrödinger equation. As discussed
above, the purpose of the Functional Schrödinger equation is to
introduce the “observer” time into the Wheeler-de Witt equation, Eq.( 1
). This will allow us to be able to use the classical Hamiltonian of the
system of gravitational collapse, then study the evolution of the system
from the view point of any observer of our choosing. This has two
benefits: First the formalism allows us to choose the “observer” we wish
to study. As discussed earlier, different “observers” will observer
different phenomena which are of interest. Secondly, the formalism will
allow us to evolve the system quantum mechanically over time. One of the
benefits of this approach is that we can, in principle, observe
thermodynamic properties of the system in a time-dependent fashion,
which we will discuss in Chapters \thechapter and \thechapter . As we
will discuss, this is something which is beyond the scope of the usual
methods used to study the thermodynamic properties of the system.

## Chapter \thechapter Occupation Number

Throughout the text we will be interested in the number of particles
created during the gravitational collapse of our object, i.e. the
radiation. Therefore we will derive the occupation number of the
particles created during the time of collapse in this chapter for future
convenience. Throughout this text we will be interested in systems with
spherical symmetry, since this is the simplest case to consider. Here we
note that due to the spherical symmetry, gravitational radiation is
excluded from the system, thus the radiation which we will consider will
be from the excitation of particles due to the time-dependent nature of
the gravitational metric.

To consider the radiation we will consider a quantum scalar field @xmath
in the background of the gravitational collapsing object, which is given
by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (13)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the action of the scalar field. The reason we are
considering only a scalar field is that this is the simplest and easiest
case, which gives insight into most of the physically significant
phenomena. By considering more complicated fields, one arrives at the
so-called gray-body factors, see for example Ref. [ 23 ] , which are
dependent on the type of field used. Here we derive the number of
particles induced as a function of observer time “ @xmath ”. Here “
@xmath ” is used for any foliation of space-time used throughout this
body of work, whether the time is that of an asymptotic observer or that
of an infalling observer.

In most cases we arrive at the Hamiltonian of the system from Eq.( 13 ),
which is of the form of a sum of uncoupled simple harmonic oscillator.
To simplify the notation, we consider one eigenmode of the simple
harmonic oscillator given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (14)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the momentum conjugate to @xmath and @xmath is the
eigenmode. Using the standard quantization procedure, upon inserting
Eq.( 14 ) into Eq.( 12 ), we can then write

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (15)
  -- -------- -- ------

Here Eq.( 15 ) can be solved exactly by utilizing the invariant operator
method first developed by Lewis and Reisenfeld, see Ref. [ 2 ] and
Appendix \thechapter . Using this method, Dantas, Pedrosa and Baseia
showed, see Ref. [ 3 ] , that the exact solution to Eq.( 15 ) at late
times is given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (16)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath denotes the derivative of @xmath with respect to @xmath ,
and @xmath is given by the real solution of the non-linear auxilarly
equation

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (17)
  -- -------- -- ------

with intitial conditions

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (18)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the initial time. The time-dependent phase @xmath is
given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (19)
  -- -------- -- ------

To find the occupation number of the induced radiation, consider an
observer with detectors that are designed to register particles of
different frequencies for the free scalar field @xmath at earlier times.
Such an observer will interpret the wavefunction of a given mode @xmath
at late times in terms of simple harmonic oscillator states, @xmath , at
final frequency @xmath . Here @xmath , is the value of the frequency
evaluated at a time @xmath as seen by the observer. The number of quanta
in eigenmode @xmath can be evaluated by decomposing the wavefunction
Eq.( 16 ) in terms of the states @xmath , and by evaluating the
occupation number of that mode. To implement this, we start by writing
the wavefunction for a given mode at time @xmath in terms of the simple
harmonic oscillator basis at @xmath

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (20)
  -- -------- -- ------

where

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (21)
  -- -------- -- ------

is the overlap, i.e. inner product, between the initial and final state
of the wavefunction. The occupation number at eigenfrequency @xmath by
the time @xmath , is given by the expectation value

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (22)
  -- -------- -- ------

To evaluate the sum in Eq.( 22 ), we use the simple harmonic oscillator
basis states but at a frequency @xmath to keep track of the different
@xmath ’s in the calculation. To evaluate the occupation numbers at time
@xmath , we need only set @xmath . So the simple harmonic oscillator
basis states are written as (see for example Appendix A.4 of Ref. [ 22 ]
)

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (23)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath are the Hermite polynomials. Then Eq.( 21 ) and Eq.( 16 )
together gives

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (24)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

where

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (25)
  -- -------- -- ------

To find @xmath consider the corresponding integral over the generating
function for the Hermite polynomials

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (26)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

Since

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (27)
  -- -------- -- ------

we can then write

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (28)
  -- -------- -- ------

Therefore

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (29)
  -- -------- -- ------

Since

  -- -- -- ------
           (30)
  -- -- -- ------

and @xmath for @xmath , we find the coefficients @xmath for even values
of @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (31)
  -- -------- -- ------

For odd @xmath , @xmath .

We can now find the number of particles produced during the collapse.
Let

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (32)
  -- -------- -- ------

Then using Eq.( 22 ) we have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (33)
                       @xmath   @xmath

                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

Now inserting Eq.( 25 ) and Eq.( 32 ) leads to

### 3 Discussion

Here we derived the occupation number of the radiation induced during
the time of gravitational collapse. The occupation number is measured by
an observer with a detector at late times @xmath . As stated earlier,
this was done for convenience since we will use this quantity several
times during this text.

## Chapter \thechapter Model

To study a concrete realization of black hole formation we consider a
spherically symmetric Nambu-Goto domain wall (representing a shell of
matter) that is collapsing. To include the possibility of (spherically
symmetric) radiation, as discussed in the previous chapter (Chapter
\thechapter ), we consider a massless scalar field, @xmath , that is
coupled to the gravitational field but not directly to the domain wall.
The action for the system is then given as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (35)
  -- -------- -- ------

The first term is the Einstein-Hilbert action for the gravitational
field, the second is the scalar field action, the third is the domain
wall action in terms of the wall world volume coordinates, @xmath (
@xmath ), the wall tension @xmath , and the induced world volume metric

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (36)
  -- -------- -- ------

As stated in Chapter \thechapter , the coordinates @xmath describe the
location of the wall. The term @xmath in Eq.( 35 ) denotes the action
for the observer.

As discussed earlier, a general treatment of full Wheeler-de Witt
equation, Eq.( 1 ), is very difficult. So, we shall use the frequently
employed strategy of truncating the field degrees of freedom to a finite
set, typically including only the relevant degrees of freedom. In other
words, we will consider the minisuperspace version of the Wheeler-de
Witt equation. As long as we keep all the relevant degrees of freedom,
this is a useful truncation. Since we are considering spherically
symmetric domain walls, we will assume spherical symmetry for all the
fields. Thus, the wall is described by the radial degree of freedom
@xmath only.

The metric for the wall is then taken to be the solution to Einstein
equations for a spherical domain wall. In Ref. [ 4 ] the metric, as
follows from the spherical symmetry, outside the wall is given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (37)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the Schwarzschild radius in terms of the mass @xmath of
the wall, and

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (38)
  -- -------- -- ------

By Birkhoff’s theorem, in the interior of the spherical domain wall the
line element of the metric is flat, i.e. Minkowski, which is given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (39)
  -- -------- -- ------

Here @xmath is the interior time coordinate, not to be confused with
temperature. The interior time coordinate is related to the asymptotic
observer time coordinate @xmath via the proper time @xmath of the domain
wall. By matching the coordinates for the interior and exterior at the
wall, in analogy with the Isreal junction condition (see Ref. [ 5 ] ),
and assuming that the wall is infinitely thin, we have the relations

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (40)
  -- -------- -- ------

and

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (41)
  -- -------- -- ------

where

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (42)
  -- -------- -- ------

By taking the ratio of Eq.( 146 ) and Eq.( 41 ), the relationship
between the interior time @xmath and the asymptotic time @xmath is given
by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (43)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath and @xmath .

Since we are restricting the system to fields with spherical symmetry
only, we need not include other metric degrees of freedom. Thus, the
scalar field can also be truncated to be the spherically symmetric modes

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (44)
  -- -------- -- ------

In Ref. [ 4 ] , Ipser and Sikivie integrated the equations of motion for
the spherically symmetric domain wall. They found that the mass is
actually a constant of motion and is given by, see Appendix \thechapter
for a sketch of the method used,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (45)
  -- -------- -- ------

where it is assumed that max( @xmath ) @xmath . This assumption is just
used to ensure that one does not start off inside of the collapsing
spherical domain wall.

By virtue of Eq.( 42 ), Eq.( 45 ) is implicit since @xmath . Solving for
@xmath explicitly in terms of @xmath gives

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (46)
  -- -------- -- ------

However, making use of Eq.( 43 ) we can solve for @xmath in terms of
@xmath

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (47)
  -- -------- -- ------

Before we proceed we wish to discuss the physical relevance of Eq.( 46
). First consider the case where @xmath , i.e. for a static domain wall.
The first term in the square bracket is just the total rest mass of the
shell. When the shell is moving, i.e. @xmath , the first term in the
square bracket takes the kinetic energy of the domain wall into account.
The last term in the square bracket is the self-gravity, or the binding
energy of the domain wall. Therefore we can identify Eq.( 46 ) (Eq.( 47
)) as the total energy of the system, hence the Hamiltonian of the
system. Thus, we will refer to Eq.( 46 ) (Eq.( 47 )) as the Hamiltonian.

### 4 Discussion

Here we developed the classical Hamiltonian for a massive spherically
symmetric domain wall undergoing gravitational collapse. As stated in
the last paragraph, Eq.( 46 ) is the conserved mass of the system,
however, it can be interpreted as the Hamiltonian. For the remainder of
the text, we will use Eq.( 46 ) (Eq.( 47 )) as the Hamiltonian for the
system.

## Chapter \thechapter Classical Treatment

In this chapter we wish to study the classical equations of motion of
the collapsing spherically symmetric domain wall. To do so, we will
consider the cases for two different foliations of space-time. Here we
consider the collapse of the spherically symmetric domain wall from the
point of view of an asymptotic observer (one who is at rest with respect
to the collapse) and from the point of view of an infalling observer
(one who is riding along with the shell). This will be done by
considering Eq.( 47 ) and Eq.( 46 ).

A naive approach to obtaining the dynamics for the spherical domain wall
is to insert Eq.( 37 ) and Eq.( 39 ), as well as Eq.( 46 ) into the
original action Eq.( 35 ). Upon doing so it is known that this approach
does not give the correct dynamics for gravitating systems. Therefore we
will take an alternative approach for finding the action. We will find
the action that does in fact lead to the correct mass conservation law.
The form of the action can be deduced from Eq.( 47 ) (Eq.( 46 )).

### 5 Asymptotic Observer

First we will consider the equations of motion from the view point of
the asymptotic observer. The asymptotic observer is any observer
stationary with respect to the collapsing domain wall, typically taken
to be located at infinity. Here we summarize the work originally done in
Ref. [ 30 ] .

From Eq.( 47 ) we find the effective action for the spherically
symmetric domain wall to be

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (48)
  -- -------- -- ------

Using Eq.( 43 ) we can write Eq.( 48 ) in terms of the asymptotic
observer time @xmath as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (49)
  -- -------- -- ------

From Eq.( 49 ) the effective Lagrangian for the system is

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (50)
  -- -------- -- ------

The generalized momentum @xmath can be derived from Eq.( 50 ) in the
usual manner, this is given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (51)
  -- -------- -- ------

Therefore from the Lagrangian, Eq.( 50 ), and the generalized momentum,
Eq.( 51 ), the Hamiltonian can then be written as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (52)
  -- -------- -- ------

For later convenience, we wish to find the Hamiltonian as a function of
@xmath . To do so, we need to eliminate @xmath in favor of @xmath using
Eq.( 51 ). This can be done, in principle, but is very messy (the
solution will involve solutions of a quartic polynomial). However, we
will be interested in what is happening as the shell approaches the
horizon, i.e. when @xmath is close to @xmath and hence @xmath , since
this is the most interesting region of study. In this limit one can see
that the denominators of the two terms in Eq.( 51 ) are equal. So we can
rewrite Eq.( 51 ) as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (53)
  -- -------- -- ------

where

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (54)
  -- -------- -- ------

In the region @xmath the Hamiltonian, Eq.( 52 ), is then approximately
given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (55)
              @xmath   @xmath      (56)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

Here we note that the Hamiltonian, written in the form of Eq.( 56 ), has
the form of the energy of a relativistic particle with a position
dependent mass.

Since the mass is a constant of motion, the Hamiltonian is a conserved
quantity, so from Eq.( 55 ) we can write

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (57)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is a constant.

Solving Eq.( 57 ) for @xmath we obtain

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (58)
  -- -------- -- ------

In the region @xmath , this takes the form

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (59)
  -- -------- -- ------

Since in the region @xmath , @xmath , the dynamics for the collapsing
spherically symmetric domain wall in this region can be obtained by
solving the expression

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (60)
  -- -------- -- ------

To leading order in @xmath , the solution is

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (61)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the radius of the shell at @xmath . Since we are
interested in the collapsing shell, we take the negative sign in the
exponential term, Eq.( 61 ).

Here we wish to make some comments on Eq.( 61 ). By virtue of the
negative sign in the exponential, this then implies that, from the
classical point of view, the asymptotic observer never sees the
formation of the horizon of the black hole, since Eq.( 61 ) equals
@xmath only as @xmath . This is in agreement with the fact that it takes
an infinite amount of time for a photon to reach the horizon of a
pre-existing black hole, as seen by an asymptotic observer (see for
example Ref. [ 7 ] ). Therefore, Eq.( 61 ) makes sense from this point
of view.

In Figure 1 we plot the position of the domain wall for the asymptotic
observer. Here we see the asymptotic behavior of the time dependence of
the position of the domain wall. As shown in Eq.( 61 ), the domain wall
asymptotes to the Schwarzschild radius, taking an infinite amount of
time for the domain wall to reach the Schwarzschild radius.

Figure 2 shows the corresponding velocity of the domain wall as seen by
the asymptotic observer. Here we see that the velocity of the domain
wall asymptotes to zero as the domain wall collapses toward the
Schwarzschild radius, as given in Eq.( 60 ).

### 6 Infalling Observer

Now we turn our attention to the infalling observer case, where the
conserved mass is given by Eq.( 46 ). Here we point out the misnomer in
the name infalling. The infalling observe here is not to be confused
with the traditional view point of an infalling observer, one who is
traveling along a geodesic, or a freely falling observer. The observer
in this case is infalling from the fact that the observer is attached to
the domain wall and is infalling with the wall. Therefore, eventhough
the observer is in a locally Minkowski reference frame, the overall
reference frame is still Schwarzschild, since at any point in time the
observer is in a Schwarzschild reference frame. Here we summarize the
work originally done in Ref. [ 31 ] .

The effective action consistent with Eq.( 46 ) is

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (62)
  -- -------- -- ------

Therefore the effective Lagrangian expressed in terms of the infalling
observer’s time @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (63)
  -- -------- -- ------

From Eq.( 63 ) the generalized momentum @xmath is derived to be

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (64)
  -- -------- -- ------

From Eq.( 63 ) and Eq.( 64 ), the Hamiltonian in terms of @xmath is
given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (65)
  -- -------- -- ------

which is just Eq.( 46 ) as expected.

From Eq.( 65 ) we can calculate @xmath

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (66)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath . In general, Eq.( 66 ) cannot be solved analytically, at
least not in very nice way. However, we can take some special cases to
investigate the behavior of the solution to find the time dependence.

As a first case we consider the zeroth order behavior near the horizon,
i.e. @xmath . In this region we note that we can write Eq.( 66 ) as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (67)
  -- -------- -- ------

hence @xmath is constant. Integrating Eq.( 67 ) gives

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (68)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the radius of the shell at @xmath .

As a second case we consider the case that @xmath . Therefore we can
write Eq.( 66 ) as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (69)
  -- -------- -- ------

Integrating Eq.( 69 ) we then have the solution

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (70)
  -- -------- -- ------

Eq.( 70 ) then gives that the time for an infalling observer to reach
@xmath is

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (71)
  -- -------- -- ------

Here we make some comments on Eq.( 68 ) and Eq.( 70 ). These solutions
imply that the infalling observer will reach @xmath in a finite amount
of his/her proper time. This result is expected from classical general
relativity, since the observer is in a locally flat Minkowski reference
frame. Therefore, there is no difficulty for the observer once he/she
reaches the horizon, the horizon is just another locally flat point in
space according to this observer.

For consistency, in Figure 3 we plot the numerical solution of Eq.( 66 )
for the parameters @xmath and @xmath . Figure 3 shows that the observer
does in fact reach @xmath in a finite amount of his proper time. Figure
4 compares the special cases discussed above with that of the numerical
solution. Here the blue curve is the full solution of Eq.( 66 ), the
green curve is the solution to Eq.( 67 ) and the red curve is the
solution to Eq.( 69 ).

In Figure 5 we plot the numerical solution for the velocity of the
domain wall as seen by the infalling observer, from Eq.( 66 ). Since the
domain wall crosses its own Schwarzschild radius at a time of @xmath ,
Figure 5 shows that the velocity is infact approximately constant as
@xmath . After the domain wall crosses the Schwarzschild radius, the
velocity then increases and diverges as @xmath (the classical
singularity).

In Figure 6 we plot the numerical solution for the acceleration of the
domain wall as seen by the infalling observer, from Eq.( 66 ). Since the
domain wall crosses its own Schwarzschild radius at a time of @xmath ,
Figure 6 shows that the acceleration is increasing almost linearly as
@xmath . After the domain wall crosses the Schwarzschild radius, the
acceleration then increases and diverges as @xmath (the classical
singularity). Therefore, we can conclude that even though the observer
is attached to the domain wall, he/she is not a truly free-falling
observer (as stated at the beginning of this Section). The infalling
Schwarzschild observer is an accelerated observer during the entire
duration of the collapse.

### 7 Comparing Asymptotic versus Infalling

Here we wish to investigate the discrepancy of the observation between
the infalling and asymptotic observers.

To understand this discrepancy we turn to Eq.( 41 ). As discussed in the
previous section, in the limit @xmath , Eq.( 66 ) is approximately
constant. This means that we can then write

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (72)
  -- -------- -- ------

Now, since @xmath in this limit and the proper time taken to reach the
Schwarzschild radius is finite, we can then see that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (73)
  -- -------- -- ------

This is a fairly crude approximating, thus in Figure 7 we plot @xmath
versus @xmath . Figure 7 shows that as @xmath , @xmath does indeed
diverge as given in Eq.( 73 ). Therefore Eq.( 73 ) can be thought of as
the gravitational red-shift, which is the source of the discrepancy
between the observations between the two observers. In Figure 8 we show
the the position of the domain wall as a function of time for both the
asymptotic and infalling observers. Figure 8 shows that initially the
two observers are in agreement on where the domain wall is compared to
the Schwarzschild radius. However, as the time increases (both
asymptotic, @xmath , and infalling, @xmath ) the discrepancy becomes
more apparent. According to the asymptotic observer, the domain wall
asymptotes to the Schwarzschild radius, while according to the infalling
observer this happens in a finite amount of time (as stated earlier).

### 8 Discussion

In this section we investigated the classical equations of motion for
the collapsing spherically symmetric domain wall. As discussed in the
first section, the asymptotic observer sees the domain wall collapse to
the Schwarzschild radius @xmath only as @xmath . This is not an
unreasonable result since in classical General Relativity an asymptotic
observer never sees a photon cross the Schwarzschild radius since it
take an infinite amount of time @xmath to reach the horizon. Therefore
one can easily believe the result here, since the time taken is due to
the gravitational redshift of the photon. As the shell approaches @xmath
the redshift will increase until it becomes infinite by the time it
reaches the horizon.

In the second section, the infalling observer will see the shell
collapse to the horizon in a finite amount of time. As discussed
earlier, this is because the infalling observer is always in a locally
flat Minkowski frame. Thus, the horizon is not a significant point for
the observer, therefore there is no problem for him/her to pass right
through and not even know it. This result is again expected from
classical General Relativity.

## Chapter \thechapter Quantum Treatment

In this chapter we wish to study the quantum equations of motion using
the Functional Schrödinger equation Eq.( 12 ), again for the two
different foliations of space-time. The idea here is that the quantum
mechanical effects will change some of the difficulties that arise from
the classical solutions. The ultimate goal is that examining these
quantum mechanical effects will give us insight into the quantum
mechanical nature of gravitational collapse and will possibly help guide
us to be able to construct the appropriate theory of quantum gravity.

Some of the difficulties that arise from the classical solutions of
gravitation collapse are discussed below. This is not meant to be an
exhaustive list, but give the reader of an idea of the topics that we
wish to address in this text.

First we will discuss one difficulty faced by the asymptotic observer,
the presence of the horizon. Why is the event horizon a difficult place
for the asymptotic observer, while there is it is no problem for the
infalling observer, since the horizon is nothing more than a coordinate
singularity? Under the classical notion, as discussed in Chapter
\thechapter , the presence of the coordinate singular creates an
apparent gravitational time dilation, which makes the collapsing domain
wall appear to stop. This effect is due to the divergence of the
coordinate singularity when the observer sees the collapsing domain wall
reach the Schwarzschild radius. There has been much discussion in this
matter about how these quantum mechanical corrections can eliminate this
effect. One such idea that has gained much attention over the past few
years, we will discuss this process here. The basic idea here is that
the upon quantizing the shell, the shell will now have quantum
fluctuations in the position of the horizon. These fluctuations will
then imply that the position of the horizon is no longer fixed, but will
now be given by @xmath , where @xmath represents the small fluctuations
in the position of the horizon. These effects can then make the time as
measured by the asymptotic observer finite (see for example Sec. 10.1.5
of Ref. [ 8 ] )

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (74)
  -- -------- -- ------

If this were correct, we would be able to observe black hole formation
(due to the collapse) and other effects in finite time. Note however,
that the fluctuations can go either way. In the case of @xmath , the
result becomes infinite agin.

Now we will discuss difficulties facing the infalling observer. For this
observe there are really two important regimes: The regime in the region
@xmath and the region @xmath . For the region @xmath , the concern is
the exact opposite of that of the asymptotic observer. Will the
quantization of the shell contradict the classical observation that the
infalling observer sees the shell collapse to @xmath in a finite amount
of time? For the region @xmath , classically this represents the point
of the classical singularity. Penrose and Hawking showed in Ref. [ 9 ]
that singularities are endemic in classical General Relativity. The
question then arises whether these singularities are an intrinsic
property of space-time or simply reflect our lack of the ultimate
non-singular theory. The general belief is that quantization will rid
gravitation of singularities. This is analogous to another theory where
quantization got rid of the singularity, Electromagnetism. In atomic
physics the singularity of the Coulomb potential, which has an identical
@xmath behavior, was eliminated via quantization (see for example [ 10 ,
11 , 12 , 13 ] ).

In this chapter we investigate these ideas. In later chapters we will
investigate quantum mechanical corrects to addition aspects of
gravitational collapse, those being thermodynamic.

### 9 Asymptotic Observer

First we will consider quantization of the shell from the view point of
the asymptotic observer. This will be done by using Eq.( 12 ). For this
section we outline the work done in Ref. [ 30 ] .

To utilize Eq.( 12 ) we need to use the Hamiltonian in Eq.( 56 ).
However, we notice that Eq.( 56 ) has a squareroot in it. Therefore, we
will consider the Hamiltonian squared

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (75)
  -- -------- -- ------

Before we proceed, we discuss the choice of ordering in the first term
on the right hand side of Eq.( 75 ). Since we are considering quantum
mechanics, the distance @xmath and the conjugate momentum are now
promoted to operators, which obey the standard commutation relations.
Thus in general we would need to add terms to the squared Hamiltonian in
Eq.( 75 ) that depend on the commutator @xmath . However, in region of
interest we find that the commutator is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Estimating @xmath by the mass @xmath of the domain wall, as for the
discussion in Chapter \thechapter , the terms due to the operater order
ambiguity will be negligible provided

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the Planck mass. Therefore we can ignore the ordering
ambiguity and chose the ordering given in Eq.( 75 ), provided that this
limit is satisfied.

Now we apply the standard quantization procedure,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We substitute

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (76)
  -- -------- -- ------

into the squared Schrödinger equation

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (77)
  -- -------- -- ------

Inserting Eq.( 75 ) into Eq.( 16.1 ) we then obtain

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (78)
  -- -------- -- ------

To find the wavefunction for the collapsing domain wall we need to solve
Eq.( 78 ). To solve Eq.( 78 ) in terms of @xmath can be a formidable
exercise in mathematics. However, we can simplify the matter by defining
the tortoise coordinate

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (79)
  -- -------- -- ------

We can then see that Eq.( 79 ) then gives

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (80)
  -- -------- -- ------

where we used Eq.( 76 ). Using Eq.( 80 ) we can then rewrite Eq.( 78 )
as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (81)
  -- -------- -- ------

We can now identify Eq.( 81 ) as just the massive wave equation in a
Minkowski background with a mass term that depends on the position of
the domain wall. We need to now solve Eq.( 81 ) for @xmath . To do so,
we must first write the mass term in terms of @xmath , rather than its
present state of @xmath . However, some care is needed since at @xmath ,
@xmath is divergent, so we must take the appropriate branch. From Eq.(
79 ) we have that for the region @xmath maps onto @xmath and @xmath maps
onto @xmath .

We are interested in the situation of a collapsing shell, hence the
region @xmath . Thus we are interested in @xmath in the region @xmath .
We can solve Eq.( 81 ) for the entire region, however, we are mostly
concerned with the effect when @xmath . In the region @xmath , the
logarithm in Eq.( 79 ) dominates, so we can write

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (82)
  -- -------- -- ------

We look for wave-packet solutions propagating toward @xmath , or in
terms of @xmath , @xmath . Thus from Eq.( 82 ) we have

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (83)
  -- -------- -- ------

This means that the last term in Eq.( 81 ), the mass term, can be
ignored in this region.

In the region @xmath , the dynamics of the wave-packet is simply given
by the free wave equation, where any function of light-cone coordinates
@xmath is a solution. To make this explicit, we consider a Gaussian
wave-packet propagating toward the Schwarzschild radius

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (84)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is some chosen width of the wave packet in the @xmath
coordinate. The width of the wave-packet remains fixed in the @xmath
-coordinate while it shrinks in the @xmath coordinate via the relation
@xmath , as follows from Eq.( 79 ).

Let us consider some properties of Eq.( 84 ). First, we see that the
wave-packet travels at the speed of light in the @xmath coordinate. This
is expected since the Schrödinger equation takes the form of a massless
wave equation in Minkowski space. Further, in the @xmath coordinate, the
wave packet must travel out to @xmath to get to the horizon, @xmath .
Thus we can conclude that the quantum domain wall does not collapse to
@xmath in a finite amount of asymptotic time.

Therefore one can conclude that the quantum mechanical effect, i.e. the
quantization of the domain wall, does not smear out the presence of the
coordinate singularity at the Schwarzschild radius. The asymptotic will
not see the formation of the horizon in a finite amount of his/her time.
Hence, the quantum solution does not alter the classical result found in
Chapter \thechapter .

### 10 Infalling observer

Now we consider quantization of the domain wall from the view point of
the infalling observer. This will be done using Eq.( 46 ) as the
Hamiltonian of the system. As discussed earlier, here we wish to solve
the Functional Schrödinger equation in two different regions of
interest. The first region is that near the Schwarzschild radius, @xmath
. The second is the region near the classical singularity, in the region
@xmath . For this section we summarize the work originally done in Ref.
[ 31 ] .

#### 10.1 Near Horizon

The exact Hamiltonian in terms of @xmath is again given by Eq.( 46 ).
From Eq.( 46 ) we again see the presence of a square-root. However, in
this case it is not as easy to remedy this as it was in the case of the
asymptotic observer, since upon squaring the Hamiltonian will not get
rid of the square root. To simplify the analysis we will require that
@xmath is small. This is indeed a restriction to the special motion of
the wall, since in general @xmath can be large near @xmath if the shell
is falling from a very large distance. However, one may always choose
initial conditions in such a way that the initial position of the shell
@xmath is very close to @xmath .

In the limit of small @xmath , Eq.( 46 ) simplifies to

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (85)
  -- -------- -- ------

Then again in the same limit, the conjugate momentum Eq.( 64 )
simplifies to

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (86)
  -- -------- -- ------

Ignoring the constant terms from the Hamiltonian Eq.( 85 ) and using
Eq.( 86 ) we can write the Hamiltonian as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (87)
  -- -------- -- ------

Using the standard quantization procedure, we substitute

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (88)
  -- -------- -- ------

into the Schrödinger equation Eq.( 12 ), which yields

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (89)
  -- -------- -- ------

Investigating Eq.( 89 ), we see that Eq.( 89 ) is just the Schrödinger
equation for a freely propagating “particle” of mass @xmath , as one can
expect from this approximation. Since @xmath is only a finite distance
away for an infalling observer we conclude that the wavefunction will
collapse at @xmath in a finite amount of proper time.

For the question on if the quantization of the domain wall will cause
problems for the infalling observer, we can conclude that quantum
effects do not alter the classical result. Hence a collapsing shell
crosses its own Schwarzschild radius in a finite proper time.

#### 10.2 Near the Origin

Now we wish to investigate the quantization of the domain wall in the
region of the classical singularity @xmath .

The exact Hamiltonian in terms of @xmath is again given by Eq.( 46 ),
where @xmath is given by Eq.( 66 ). In the region near the classical
singularity, i.e. in the limit @xmath , the classical expression for
@xmath (keeping only the leading order term) becomes

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (90)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is defined in Chapter \thechapter . Eq.( 90 ) clearly shows
that in this region the classical expression for @xmath diverges. Up to
the leading term near the origin, Eq.( 90 ) implies that the Hamiltonian
is

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (91)
  -- -------- -- ------

Substituting the asymptotic behavior, Eq.( 90 ), in the expression for
the generalized momentum Eq.( 64 ) we have

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (92)
  -- -------- -- ------

From Eq.( 92 ) we see that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (93)
  -- -------- -- ------

This then gives

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (94)
  -- -------- -- ------

This implies that @xmath , which is defined as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (95)
  -- -------- -- ------

by virtue of Eq.( 64 ), near the horizon becomes

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (96)
  -- -------- -- ------

Therefore substituting Eq.( 96 ) into Eq.( 91 ) we have

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (97)
  -- -------- -- ------

Let us consider some properties of Eq.( 97 ). The differential operator
in the exponent gives some unusual properties to the equation. First we
note the presence of the @xmath term. This implies that if we expand the
exponent we can not stop the series after a finite number of terms, but
instead need to include all orders of the expansion, we will make this
explicit below. Thus, we need to include an infinite number of
derivatives of the wavefunction @xmath into the differential equation.
An infinite number of derivatives of a certain function uniquely
specifies the whole function. Thus, the value of (the derivative of) the
function on the right hand side of Eq.( 97 ) at one point depends on the
values of the function at different points on the left hand side of the
same equation. This is in strong contrast with ordinary local
differential equations where the value of the function and certain
finite number of its derivatives are related at the same point of space.
This indicates that Eq.( 97 ) describes physics which is not strictly
local.

Here we will make the non-locality of Eq.( 97 ) explicit. To illustrate
we will use the expression involving the @xmath term, this is not
necessary, however, it will make the explanation more clear. Note that
we can rewrite @xmath as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By making a change of variable we can make this more explicit. If we
introduce the new variable @xmath , Eq.( 97 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (98)
  -- -------- -- ------

We can then see that the the differential operator in the exponents in
Eq.( 98 ) are just a translation operator, which shifts the argument of
the wavefunction by a non-infinitesimal amount of @xmath . Since the
wavefunction is complex in general, a shift by a complex value is not a
problem. Therefore Eq.( 98 ) can be written as

  -- -- -- ------
           (99)
  -- -- -- ------

Here we make an additional change in variable and define @xmath . Then
we can rewrite Eq.( 99 ) as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (100)
  -- -------- -- -------

To interpret this we rely on usual differential calculus. From calculus
we have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (101)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here the last step assumes that @xmath is small so we are justified at
keeping only the first term in the expansion. Now, performing the same
procedure as in Eq.( 101 ) we can write

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (102)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (103)
  -- -------- -- -------

However, here we cannot truncate the series after a finite number of
derivatives since by virtue of Eq.( 103 ), @xmath is not a small shift,
provided that @xmath does not go to infinity. Therefore we must keep all
orders of the derivative, since as in Eq.( 101 ) each derivative has
higher powers of @xmath .

An interesting thing to note here is that as @xmath , the non-local
effect becomes stronger and more predominant. A possible understanding
of this is as follows. Outside of the domain wall, there exists a
certain Hilbert space, while on the inside there exists a second Hilbert
space. The transition from the first Hilbert space to the second is not
necessarily a smooth transition. When the domain wall collapses to the
singularity, the effect of each of these Hilbert spaces is now taken
into account. When dealing with a massive domain wall, the warping of
space-time is greater, however it exists over a larger distance. This
makes the transition more smooth from point to point. However, for a
small domain wall, the warping is less noticeable at larger distances.
Therefore, the transition is more violent the closer one gets to the
classical singularity in this case, since in both cases the warping
diverges.

What about the value of the wavefunction at the classical singularity?
Eq.( 99 ) shows that the wavefunction near the origin @xmath is in fact
related to the wavefunction at some distant point @xmath . This also
implies that the wavefunction describing the collapsing domain wall is
non-singular at the origin. Indeed, in the limit @xmath , this equation
becomes

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (104)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we used the fact that the wavefunction at some finite @xmath ,
i.e. @xmath , is finite. From Eq.( 104 ) it then follows that @xmath .
This gives strong indication that quantization of the domain wall may
indeed rid gravity of the classical singularity.

### 11 Discussion

In this chapter we quantized the collapsing domain wall and investigated
the quantum corrections. In the first section we did this with respect
to the asymptotic observe to see if these fluctuations changed the
classical observation that the domain wall takes an infinite amount of
time to reach @xmath . Upon quantizing the domain wall, we found that in
this view point the classical scenario was not changed by the quantum
fluctuations.

In the second section we investigated the quantization of the domain
wall from the view point of the infalling observer. Here we did this for
two different points of interest, near the horizon @xmath and near the
classical singularity @xmath , respectively. In the region @xmath , we
found that upon quantizing the domain wall, the classical view point was
again unchanged. The quantum fluctuations did not alter the fact that
according to the infalling observer, the domain wall will collapse to
@xmath in a finite amount of proper time. In the region @xmath , we
found some interesting properties of the wavefunction. First, we found
that the physics of the wavefunction in this region are strongly
non-local, meaning that the value of the wavefunction at @xmath depends
on the value of the wavefunction some distance away from the classical
singularity. This situation has been previously suggested in the context
of the information loss paradox (see for example [ 14 , 15 , 16 ] ). As
we pointed out in the section, what is interesting is that this
non-local behavior becomes increasingly manifest in the limit that
@xmath , i.e. that the mass of the domain wall becomes very small. This
may be a consequence of the non-separability of the Hilbert space
between the outside of the domain wall and the singularity. In the
massive domain wall scenario, the transition from the outside to the
inside Hilbert space is smoother than in the case of the light domain
wall. Secondly, we found that the wavefunction is in fact finite at the
classical singularity, which implies that quantum fluctuations may rid
gravity of the classical singularity.

## Chapter \thechapter Radiation

In this chapter we wish to investigate one of the thermodynamic
properties of gravitational collapse. Two of the most important
thermodynamic properties of a black hole are the temperature (discussed
in this chapter) and the entropy (discussed in Chapter \thechapter ). As
mentioned in Chapter \thechapter , the benefit of the Functional
Schrödinger equation is that this will allow us to evolve the system
over time. This is in contrast with the usual method used to evaluate
the thermodynamic properties of a black hole.

The most widely used method of determining thermodynamic properties of a
black hole is the so-called Bogolyubov method. The method here is as
follows. One considers an initial asymptotically flat space-time,
usually Minkowski, at the beginning of the gravitational collapse. The
system is then allowed to evolve to a final asymptotically flat
space-time, Schwarzschild in the context of a shell of matter only, with
no knowledge of what happens in between. Then by matching the
coefficients between these two space-times, the mismatch of these two
vacua gives the number of produced particles. As mentioned, what happens
in between the initial vacua and the final vacua is beyond the scope of
the Bogolyubov method.

Since the Functional Schrödinger equation allows one to find the time
dependent wavefunction for the system, one can, in principle, ask the
question of what happens during the evolution of the collapse. In this
chapter we will investigate the time evolution of the radiation, in the
form of the occupation developed in Chapter \thechapter , during the
time of gravitational collapse. The occupation number will then allow us
to fit the temperature of the radiation, and compare with that of the
pre-formed black hole.

As discussed in Chapter \thechapter , we can consider the radiation
given off during the collapse of the domain wall by considering a
massless scalar field @xmath that is coupled to the gravitational field.
The action of the scalar field can then be written as in Eq.( 35 )

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (105)
  -- -------- -- -------

We decompose the (spherically symmetric) scalar field into a complete
set of real basis functions denoted by @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (106)
  -- -------- -- -------

The exact form of the function @xmath will not be important for us. We
will, however, be interested in the wavefunction for the mode
coefficients @xmath . Note, again here we use “ @xmath ” to be anytime
coordinate of interest to us, not necessarily the asymptotic time.

From Eq.( 39 ) and Eq.( 37 ) we can see that the action for both the
different foliations of space-time will consist of two parts, one from
Eq.( 39 ) and the second from Eq.( 37 ). In both foliations, the
asymptotic observer and the infalling observer, we will be interested in
the region @xmath , therefore we will explicitly write out Eq.( 105 )
then take the limit to find the dominating contributions.

From this action we can then find the Hamiltonian of the system using
the usual methods. Substituting the Hamiltonian into Eq.( 12 ) we can
find the time-dependent wavefunction of the system. As discussed in
Chapter \thechapter , the time-dependent wavefunction allows us to find
the occupation number @xmath , which will allow us to fit the
temperature of the radiation (which we will describe below).

In 1975 Hawking showed that for a pre-existing static black hole, the
black hole will radiate its mass away, see Ref. [ 17 ] . The radiation
that is given off has a finite temperature, as viewed by an asymptotic
observer, which is known as the Hawking temperature. Therefore, it will
be instructive for us to compare our late time result with Hawking’s
original calculation.

For the infalling observer, the calculation is also instructive to give
us an idea of what the region is like for this observer. Some unanswered
questions are: since the temperature as measured by the asymptotic
observer is finite, what is the temperature at the horizon for the local
observer? If the temperature is infinite at the horizon, as one would
expect since the temperature for the asymptotic observer is finite, will
the infalling observer burn up before he reaches the horizon? To answer
this question, we will use two different foliations of space time, that
of Schwarzschild and Eddington-Finkelstein, respectively.

### 12 Asymptotic Observer

Here we consider the radiation as measured by the asymptotic observer.
For this section we summarize the work originally done in Ref. [ 30 ] .

As stated above, the action for the scalar field can be written in two
parts

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (107)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (108)
     @xmath   @xmath      (109)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is given in Eq.( 43 ), which with Eq.( 58 ), gives

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (110)
  -- -------- -- -------

As mentioned above, we are interested in the @xmath behavior of the
action. As @xmath , we see that @xmath . Therefore the kinetic term in
Eq.( 108 ) diverges as @xmath in this limit, while the kinetic term in
Eq.( 109 ) diverges logarithmically. Therefore the divergence of the
kinetic term in Eq.( 108 ) dominates over that of the divergence of the
kinetic term in Eq.( 109 ). The gradient term in Eq.( 108 ) vanishes in
this limit, while the gradient term in Eq.( 109 ) becomes finite. Thus
the gradient term in Eq.( 109 ) is dominant over that of the gradient
term in Eq.( 108 ) in this limit. Hence the action can be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (111)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we have changed the limits of integration to @xmath since this is
the region of interest. This approximation is valid provided the
contribution from @xmath to the integrals remains subdominant, and also
the time variation introduced by the true integration limit can be
ignored.

Now, using Eq.( 106 ) we write the action in Eq.( 111 ) as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (112)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath are matrices that are independent of @xmath and
are given by

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (113)
     @xmath   @xmath      (114)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Using the standard quantization procedure and Eq.( 12 ), the
wavefunction @xmath satisfies

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (115)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (116)
  -- -------- -- -------

is the momentum operator conjugate to @xmath .

The problem of radiation from the collapsing domain wall is equivalent
to the problem of an infinite set of uncoupled harmonic oscillators
whose masses go to infinity with time. We can see from Eq.( 113 ) and
Eq.( 114 ) that the matrices @xmath and @xmath are hermitian. Therefore,
it is possible to do a principal axis transformation to simultaneously
diagonalize @xmath and @xmath (see Sec. 6-2 of Ref. [ 18 ] ) for
example). Then for a single eigenmode, the Schrödinger equation takes
the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (117)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath denote eigenvalues of @xmath and @xmath , and
@xmath is the eigenmode.

Dividing Eq.( 117 ) through by @xmath , we can write in the standard
form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (118)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (119)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (120)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we have chosen to set @xmath .

From Eq.( 61 ) we can see that the classical late time behavior of the
shell is given by @xmath . For early times, the behavior depends on how
the spherical domain wall was created and we are free to choose a
behavior for @xmath that is convenient for calculations and
interpretation. The most convenient case to use is a static beginning.
This can be obtained if we artificially take the collapse to stop at
some time, @xmath . Eventually we can then take @xmath , as given by
Chapter \thechapter . We will then chose @xmath to be

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (121)
  -- -------- -- -------

With the choice of initial static space-time of the domain wall, the
initial vacuum state for the modes is the simple harmonic oscillator
ground state,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (122)
  -- -------- -- -------

The exact solution for late times is given by Eq.( 16 ) with initial
conditions given by Eq.( 18 ).

As discussed in Chapter \thechapter an observer with a detector will
interpret the wavefunction of a given mode @xmath at late times in terms
of simple harmonic oscillator states at the final frequency

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (123)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we have made use of Eq.( 121 ).

The number of quanta in eigenmode @xmath can be evaluated from Eq.( 33
). By calculating @xmath it can be checked that @xmath remains constant
for @xmath and also @xmath . Hence all the particle production occurs
for @xmath and is a consequence of the gravitational collapse.

Now we can take the limit @xmath . In this limit, @xmath remains finite
but @xmath as @xmath , provided @xmath (see Appendix \thechapter for
details). However, we are interested in the behavior of @xmath for fixed
frequency, @xmath . From Eq.( 123 ) in this limit implies @xmath . From
the discussion in Appendix \thechapter , we also know that @xmath as
@xmath . Hence we find

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (124)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore the occupation number at any frequency diverges in the
infinite time limit when backreaction is not taken into account. In
Figure 9 we have plotted the occupation number @xmath versus @xmath for
various values of @xmath . Figure 9 confirms the late time behavior of
the time dependence of the occupation number, Eq.( 124 ).

We have also numerically evaluated the spectrum of mode occupation
numbers at any finite time and show the results in Figure 10 for several
different values of @xmath . Figure 10 shows that as the asymptotic
observer’s time increases, the occupation number of larger values of
@xmath increases. This is consistent with Eq.( 120 ), since as @xmath ,
@xmath .

To find the temperature of the radiation, we compare the curve in Figure
10 with the occupation numbers for the Planck distribution

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (125)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the inverse temperature. We can see that the spectrum of
occupation numbers is non-thermal. As an example, there is no
singularity in @xmath at @xmath at finite time. However, as @xmath , the
peak at @xmath does diverge and the distribution becomes more and more
thermal for these times. There are also oscillations in @xmath .

We now wish to fit the temperature of the radiation. From Eq.( 125 ), we
can find the inverse temperature to be

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (126)
  -- -------- -- -------

In Figure 11 we plot @xmath versus @xmath for various values of @xmath .
Here we see that for smaller values of @xmath the spectrum for @xmath is
non-thermal. For example, Figure 11 shows a thermal-like distribution
for only small values of @xmath for @xmath , while the larger values or
@xmath are not yet thermally induced. If one fitted the slope of @xmath
for this particular time, the only relevant region is that between
@xmath . We can also see that the fluctuations of @xmath are large.
However, as @xmath increases more and more values of @xmath are
thermally induced, hence one can fit a larger region. The fluctuations
for larger values of @xmath become much smaller, until they become
almost completely non-existent. Another feature which occurs as @xmath
increases is that the slope of @xmath goes to zero, which would imply
that the temperature of the radiation in fact goes to infinity, not to a
finite number as predicted by Hawking.

However, from Eq.( 118 ) we see that the time derivative of the
wavefunction on the right-hand side is with respect to @xmath , not with
respect to @xmath , and @xmath is the mode frequency with respect to
@xmath as well. Eq.( 119 ) tells us that the frequency in @xmath is
@xmath times the frequency in @xmath , so at the final time @xmath ,
this implies

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (127)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the superscript @xmath on @xmath refers to the fact that this
frequency is with respect to time @xmath . However, since we are
interested in the temperature in time @xmath , we must also rescale the
temperature in the same manner as the frequency. So the temperature seen
by the asymptotic observer is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (128)
  -- -------- -- -------

Fitting a thermal spectrum to the collapsed spectrum of Figure 10 , as
shown in Figure 12 , we obtain

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (129)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the Hawking temperature. Since there is ambiguity in
fitting the non-thermal spectrum by a thermal distribution, we can only
say that the constant temperature, @xmath , and the Hawking temperature
are of comparable magnitude.

### 13 Infalling Observer

Here we consider the radiation as measured by the infalling observer. To
do so we will consider two different foliations of space time. As seen
in Chapter \thechapter , the acceleration of the Schwarzschild observer
becomes divergent as the observer crosses the horizon. Therefore it is
important to switch to another observer whose acceleration is no longer
divergent upon crossing the horizon. For this observer, we will work in
Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates. In this section we summarize the work
originally done in Ref. [ 32 ] .

First we will consider the Schwarzschild observer, after which we will
consider the Eddington-Finkelstein observer.

#### 13.1 Schwarzschild Coordinates

The action can again be written in two parts, see Eq.( 107 ), where

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (130)
     @xmath   @xmath      (131)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

The most interesting things happen when the shell approaches the
Schwarzschild radius. From Eq.( 66 ) we see that @xmath is constant in
the limit when @xmath . Therefore the kinetic term for @xmath is roughly
constant. The kinetic term in @xmath goes to zero as @xmath , so the
@xmath kinetic term is dominant. Similarly the potential term in @xmath
goes to a constant while the potential term in @xmath becomes very
large, so the potential term in @xmath dominates. Therefore in the
region @xmath we can write the action as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (132)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we have changed the limits of integration from @xmath to @xmath
since this is the region of interest.

Using the expansion in modes, Eq.( 106 ), we can write the action as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (133)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , and @xmath and @xmath are matrices that are independent
of @xmath and are given by

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (134)
     @xmath   @xmath      (135)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

From the action Eq.( 132 ) we can find the Hamiltonian, and according to
the standard quantization procedure, the wave function @xmath must
satisfy the Functional Schrödinger equation. We can write the
Schrödinger equation as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (136)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (137)
  -- -------- -- -------

is the momentum operator conjugate to @xmath .

Again, the problem of radiation from the collapsing domain wall for the
infalling observer is equivalent to the problem of an infinite set of
uncoupled harmonic oscillators with time dependent mass and frequency.
Following the principal axis transformation used in the section above,
the single eigenmode Schrödinger equation take the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (138)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath denote eigenvalues of @xmath and @xmath , and
@xmath is the eigenmode.

Re-writing Eq.( 138 ) in the standard form we obtain

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (139)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (140)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (141)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we defined @xmath .

To proceed further, we will use the classical background of the
collapsing domain wall Eq.( 68 ). The initial vacuum state for the modes
is the simple harmonic oscillator ground state,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (142)
  -- -------- -- -------

The exact solution for late times is given by Eq.( 16 ) with initial
conditions given by Eq.( 18 ).

As discussed in Chapter \thechapter an observer with a detector will
interpret the wavefunction of a given mode @xmath at late times in terms
of simple harmonic oscillator states at the final frequency @xmath .

The number of quanta in eigenmode @xmath can be evaluated from Eq.( 33
). By calculating @xmath it can be checked that @xmath remains constant
for @xmath and also @xmath . Hence all the particle production occurs
for @xmath and is a consequence of the gravitational collapse.

Now we can take the limit @xmath . In this limit, @xmath remains finite
but @xmath as @xmath , provided @xmath (see Appendix \thechapter for
details). However, we are interested in the behavior of @xmath for fixed
frequency, @xmath . From the discussion in Appendix \thechapter , we
also know that @xmath as @xmath . Therefore the occupation number at any
frequency diverges in the infinite time limit when backreaction is not
taken into account.

In Figure 13 we plot the occupation number of produced particles as a
function of time (for several fixed frequencies @xmath ). The amount of
proper time needed for the shell to reach @xmath can be obtained by
integrating Eq.( 66 ). For @xmath this critical proper time is @xmath .
Figure 13 shows that, as the infalling observer approaches @xmath , the
occupation number increases and diverges exactly at @xmath . The same
conclusion as found by analyzing the occupation number @xmath as a
function of @xmath and @xmath (see Appendix \thechapter ). This is in
agreement with what one would expect in the absence of backreaction.
Hawking showed, see Ref. [ 17 ] , that the flux of particles at late
times diverges for a fixed background, i.e. fixed mass of the object.
Here, from Eq.( 46 ), we are treating the mass of the domain wall as a
constant of motion. This means that we keep adding energy to the domain
wall during the time of collapse, despite the the loss of mass due to
the radiation. For the asymptotic observer it takes an infinite amount
of his time for the domain wall to collapse to @xmath , see Chapter
\thechapter for discussion of this. However, this infinite time interval
corresponds to a finite amount of time for the infalling observer’s
time. Thus, one may conclude that the infalling observer has to
encounter the infinite number of particles produced during this finite
amount of time before he reaches @xmath .

We have also numerically evaluated the spectrum of mode occupation
numbers at any finite time and show the results in Figure 14 for several
different values of @xmath . Figure 14 shows that as the infalling
observer time increases, the occupation number of larger values of
@xmath increases.

To find the temperature of the radiation, we again compare the curve in
Figure 14 with the occupation numbers for the Planck distribution, which
is given by Eq.( 125 ), where @xmath is again the inverse temperature.
We can see that the spectrum of occupation numbers is non-thermal. As an
example, there is no singularity in @xmath at @xmath at finite time.
However, as @xmath , the peak at @xmath does diverge and the
distribution becomes more and more thermal for these times. There are
also oscillations in @xmath , which are not present in the Planck
distribution.

We now wish to fit the temperature of the radiation, however, from Eq.(
139 ) we see that the time derivative of the wavefunction on the
right-hand side is with respect to @xmath , not with respect to @xmath ,
and @xmath is the mode frequency with respect to @xmath as well. Eq.(
141 ) tells us that the frequency in @xmath is @xmath times the
frequency in @xmath . However, recall from Chapter \thechapter Eq.( 66 )
tells us that as @xmath , @xmath is in fact a constant. Therefore,
@xmath and @xmath , for the case of the infalling observer, only differ
by a constant amount. Hence, without loss of generality, we can ignore
this shift by a constant amount, since the general features of the
temperature will be the same. From Eq.( 125 ), we can find the inverse
temperature to be

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (143)
  -- -------- -- -------

In Figure 15 we fit a thermal spectrum to the collapsed spectrum of
Figure 14 . Several important features of the Hawking-like radiation can
be taken from from this plot. First, the non-thermal features of the
radiation are apparent. However, the departure from thermality (the
fluctuations) are larger for earlier times, hence larger frequencies.
This observation was first argued in Ref. [ 30 ] . Second, as @xmath and
the infalling observer approaches @xmath , the radiation becomes more
and more thermal even at large frequencies. Third, at @xmath , i.e.
@xmath , the radiation becomes purely thermal. At this point, the black
hole is formed and the radiation becomes thermal, as known from various
studies of quantum radiation from a pre-existing black hole. Finally, it
is apparent that the slope of @xmath versus @xmath is decreasing as the
infalling observer approaches @xmath . Exactly at @xmath , the slope of
the curve is zero, indicating that the temperature of the radiation is
infinite. This is not surprising since, as it is well known, the
asymptotic observer in the nearly flat asymptotic region will register
Hawking radiation with a finite temperature (see previous section). When
the temperature is blue-shifted back to @xmath , it clearly diverges.

#### 13.2 Infalling Eddington-Finkelstein Coordinates

Now we consider the collapse from the point of view of an infalling
Eddington-Finkelstein observer. This is a different space-time foliation
than that in Schwarzschild coordinates, and we expect crucially
different results. In particular, since the metric is not divergent at
the horizon, we do not expect infinite temperature there.

For this purpose, we define the ingoing null coordinate @xmath as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (144)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the tortoise coordinate. We can then rewrite Eq.( 37 )
as

  -- -- -- -------
           (145)
  -- -- -- -------

where the trajectory of the collapsing wall is @xmath . The interior
metric is the same as in Eq.( 39 ). The interior time coordinate, @xmath
, is related to the ingoing null coordinate, @xmath , via the proper
time on the shell, @xmath . The relations are

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (146)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (147)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (148)
  -- -------- -- -------

Consider again a massless scalar field @xmath which propagates in the
background of the collapsing shell. The action for the scalar field is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (149)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the background metric given by Eqs.( 39 ) and ( 145 ).
Decomposing the (spherically symmetric) scalar field into a complete set
of real basis functions denoted by @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (150)
  -- -------- -- -------

we can find a complete set of independent eigenmodes @xmath for which
the Hamiltonian is a sum of terms.

Since the metric inside and outside of the shell have different forms,
we again split the action into two parts

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (151)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (152)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

We are again interested in the near horizon behavior of the radiation,
i.e. as @xmath . In this limit we can write Eq.( 147 ) as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (153)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath . Then with the help of Eq.( 146 ) we can write Eq.( 151 )
as

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (154)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath . Obviously, the action is not singular as @xmath , unlike
the Schwarzschild case. From Eqs.( 152 ) and ( 154 ) we can write the
total action as

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (155)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where we have changed the limits of integration from @xmath to @xmath
since this is the region of interest.

Now using the expansion in modes Eq.( 150 ), we can rewrite the action
as

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (156)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , and @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are matrices that are
independent of @xmath and are given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (157)
     @xmath      (158)
     @xmath      (159)
  -- -------- -- -------

However if we take that the matrices are symmetric and real, we can see
that @xmath , so we can write the action as

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (160)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

From the action Eq.( 160 ) we can find the Hamiltonian, and according to
the standard quantization procedure, the wave function @xmath must
satisfy

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (161)
  -- -------- -- -------

or

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (162)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (163)
  -- -------- -- -------

is the momentum operator conjugate to @xmath . Using the momentum
operator conjugate to @xmath , we can rewrite the Schrödinger equation
as

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (164)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the Kronecker delta function.

So the problem of radiation from the collapsing domain wall for the
infalling observer is equivalent to the problem of solving an infinite
set of decoupled damped harmonic oscillators with time-dependent
frequency. Since @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are symmetric and real, it
is possible to simultaneously diagonalize them using the principle axis
transformation. Then for a single eigenmode, the Schrödinger equation
takes the form

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (165)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath denote eigenvalues of @xmath , @xmath
and @xmath , and @xmath is the eigenmode.

Re-writing Eq.( 165 ) in the standard form we obtain

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (166)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (167)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (168)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we defined @xmath . To find solutions to equation Eq.( 166 ) we
use the ansatz

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (169)
  -- -------- -- -------

This leads to the equation for @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (170)
  -- -------- -- -------

The exact solution for late times is given by Eq.( 16 ) with initial
conditions given by Eq.( 18 ). Then Eq.( 169 ) gives

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (171)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath given in Eq.( 16 ).

As discussed in Chapter \thechapter an observer with a detector will
interpret the wavefunction of a given mode @xmath at late times in terms
of simple harmonic oscillator states at the final frequency @xmath .

In Fig. 16 we plot @xmath versus @xmath for various fixed values of
@xmath . We can see that the occupation number at any frequency
increases as @xmath decreases. Thus more particles are created as the
shell reaches and crosses the horizon. However, the number of created
particles does not diverge as @xmath .

We then numerically evaluate the spectrum of mode occupation numbers at
any finite time and show the results in Fig. 17 for several values of
@xmath . The first sign of non-thermality is the fact that the
occupation number is non-divergent at @xmath , as opposed to the thermal
Planck distribution in Eq.( 125 ).

In Fig. 18 we plot @xmath versus @xmath for various values of @xmath .
As @xmath decreases (as the shell is collapsing), the curves decrease. A
thermal spectrum should gives us a straight line, however, we see that
is not the case here. The best one can do is to fit the low frequency
part of the spectrum and get the temperature in that regime. In our case
we get @xmath . Unlike the case of Schwarzschild coordinates, where the
spectrum becomes thermal in the whole frequency range, in
Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates the spectrum never becomes thermal in
the high frequency range. Another feature is apparent in Fig. 18 . As
the collapse progresses, the fluctuations in the spectrum become more
violent. This is indicative of the shell approaching the actual
singularity at @xmath which is the region of strong gravitational
fields.

### 14 Discussion

In this chapter we investigated the Hawking-like radiation produced
during the time of gravitational collapse for both the asymptotic
observer and the infalling observer. The occupation number of the
radiation was then used to fit the temperature of the radiation as the
shell approaches @xmath . When considering Schwarzschild coordinates, in
both cases the resulting analysis lead to the same conclusions: First,
that the spectrum of the occupation display non-thermal characteristics
during the time of collapse. This non-thermality is seen by a
non-divergent occupation number when @xmath and in oscillations about
thermality. Second, the spectrum becomes more and more thermal as the
domain wall approaches @xmath , corresponding to large @xmath values.
Finally, the spectrum becomes purely thermal when the domain wall
reaches @xmath . When consider Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates for the
infalling observer, we find that the spectrum never becomes thermal in
the high frequency range.

In the case of the asymptotic observer, upon fitting the temperature, we
find that the temperature of the radiation is on the order of the
Hawking temperature. This value is not exactly the Hawking temperature
for two reasons. First, when fitting the temperature we use a best fit
approximation for the slope of @xmath . However, there is ambiguity for
choosing the best fit approximation, thus the true slope of @xmath may
be different from the one chosen. Second, we are fitting the temperature
numerically. There is always an inherent approximation used we using
numerical methods, therefore our calculation is inherently ambiguous.

In the case of the infalling observer, upon fitting the temperature in
Schwarzschild coordinates, we find that when the shell reaches @xmath
the temperature of the radiation becomes divergent. This would seem to
imply that the local temperature measured by the observer is then
infinite, meaning that the observer will burn up before he/she reaches
@xmath . However, this is not necessarily the case. It has been argued
in Ref. [ 19 ] , where a simple @xmath model was studied, that the local
vacuum polarization will cancel out the divergent temperature energy
density due to the radiation. Therefore, the true local value of the
stress-energy tensor is small in the region @xmath . A simple reason for
this divergent temperature is that the Schwarzschild observer is
actually an accelerated observer, so to truly investigate the local
temperature one must consider a truly freely falling observer, i.e. the
Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates. In this case, upon fitting the
temperature, we find that the local temperature is in fact finite.

## Chapter \thechapter Entropy

In 1972 Bekenstein argued that a black hole of mass @xmath has an
entropy proportional to its surface area, see Ref. [ 20 ] . Further
calculations by Gibbons and Hawking showed that the entropy of a black
hole is always a constant, despite the type of metric which is used, see
Ref. [ 21 ] . They showed that the expression for the entropy is given
by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (172)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the surface area of the event horizon and @xmath is the
Schwarzschild radius for a black hole which contains only mass.

The typical method for calculating the entropy of the black hole is to
first calculate the temperature of the black hole using the so-called
Bogolyubov method. Here, one considers that the system starts in an
asymptotically flat metric (typically Minkowski), then the system
evolves to a new asymptotically flat metric (in the case of just mass,
the typically final metric is that of Schwarzschild). One then matches
the coefficients between the two asymptotically flat spaces at the
beginning and end of the gravitational collapse. The mismatch of these
two vacua gives the number of particles produced during the collapse.
What happens in between is then beyond the scope of the Bogolyubov
method, since the method is generally independent of time. Therefore the
time-evolution of the thermodynamics properties of the collapse cannot
be investigated in the context of the Bogoyubov method.

Here we will investigate the time-evolution of a spherically symmetric
infinitely shell of collapsing matter in the context of the Functional
Schrödinger formalism. Since the Functional Schrödinger formalism
depends on the observer’s degrees of freedom, one can introduce the
“observer” time into the quantum mechanical processes, with the use of
the Wheeler-de Witt equation, in the form of the Schrödinger equation,
see Chapter \thechapter . To study the case of gravitational collapse,
one can then choose the classical Hamiltonian of the collapsing object,
then employ the standard quantization condition. The wavefunctional is
then dependent on the observer time chosen, hence one can view the
quantum mechanical processes of a given system under any foliation of
space-time that one chooses. The benefit of using the Functional
Schrödinger formalism is that, in principle, one can solve the
time-dependent wavefunctional equation exactly, as discussed in the
previous chapters. Therefore the Functional Schrödinger formalism goes
beyond the approximations of the Bogolyubov method, since the system is
allowed to evolve over time, which allows one to investigate the
intermediate regime during the collapse. Since the wavefunctional
contains all the information of the system, one can, in principle, study
the time evolution of the thermodynamical processes of the system. Of
current interest is the time-evolution of the entropy of a collapsing
gravitational object. We will do so from the view point of a stationary
asymptotic observer, since this is the more relevant question. In this
chapter we summarize the work originally done in Ref. [ 37 ] .

### 15 Partition Function

To study the entropy of the system, we will first develop the partition
function for the system. In order to study the time-evolution of the
entropy we shall employ the so-called Liouville-von Neumann approach,
which was developed to study equilibrium and non-equilibrium quantum
processes (see Ref. [ 26 ] ). The Liouville-von Neumann approach is a
canonical method which unifies the Liouville-von Neumann equation and
the Functional Schrödinger equation. This approach utilizes the
invariant operator approach developed by Lewis and Riesenfeld (see Ref.
[ 2 ] , Chapter \thechapter and Appendix \thechapter ), which allows one
to exactly solve time-indepedent and time-dependent quantum systems. The
Liouville-von Neumann approach has been employed for several different
situations ranging from Condensed matter physics to Cosmology, see for
example see Ref. [ 27 ] . The basic assumption of the Liouville-von
Neuman approach is that non-equilibrium processes are consequences of
underlying microscopic processes which are well described by quantum
theory. The details about the collapse will depend on the particular
foliation of space-time used to study the system. From the point of view
of an infalling observer, in order to calculate the backreaction and
local effect around the event horizon it is important to choose a state
that is non-singular at the horizon. In this region, the vacuum of
choice is the Unruh vacuum (see Refs. [ 28 , 29 ] ). However, discussed
above, we are interested in the view point of the asymptotic observer.

Using the Liouville-von Neumann approach, and following the procedure
used in Ref. [ 27 ] , we can write the partition function as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (173)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is any operator which satisfies the equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (174)
  -- -------- -- -------

and @xmath is a free parameter. Here we note that Eq.( 174 ) is just the
Heisenberg equation of motion for the operator @xmath , see Ref. [ 22 ]
, where the total time derivative of the operator is zero. In the case
that the total derivative is equal to zero in the Heisenberg, this case
is known as the Liouville-von Neumann equation, see Ref. [ 2 ] .

From Ref. [ 3 ] , we can write the invariant operator @xmath as

  -- -- -- -------
           (175)
  -- -- -- -------

Here we note that the invariant operator @xmath is time dependent since
@xmath is time dependent (see Eq.( 17 )). Using Eq.( 175 ) we can
therefore write the partition function, Eq.( 173 ), as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (176)
  -- -------- -- -------

In this form we can see that the partition function is time dependent
since the invariant operator @xmath is time dependent by virtue of Eq.(
175 ).

We note that we can rewrite the invariant operator in a more suggestive
manner by writing Eq.( 175 ) as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (177)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (178)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (179)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here @xmath is the time dependent number of states. Hence, the invariant
operator @xmath takes on the form of a time-dependent harmonic
oscillator Hamiltonian, where the number operator is time dependent.

For a physical meaning of the partition function, we need to act the
invariant operator on a quantum state. In the Heisenberg picture, the
quantum states span a particular Hilbert space. A convienient basis in
this Hilbert space is the so-called Fock space representation, see Ref.
[ 23 ] . This basis is an eigenstate of the Number operator, Eq.( 178 ).
Thus at a particular time @xmath , one has in the Fock space
representation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (180)
  -- -------- -- -------

Thus, in this space we can then write the partition function as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (181)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

At first glance, one would be tempted to say that the partition function
in Eq.( 181 ) is not time-dependent since the partition function now
only depends on the initial frequency of the induced scalar field.
However, recall that @xmath is free parameter which we can choose. Here
we discuss our choice in the free parameter @xmath .

In Refs. [ 30 , 32 ] one can define the occupation number for a
frequency @xmath , Eq.( 33 ). Then by fitting the number of particles
created as the usual Planck distribution Eq.( 125 ), one can then in
principle fit the temperature of the radiation. Here, we then choose to
define @xmath as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (182)
  -- -------- -- -------

This implies that all of the time dependence of the system is encoded
into the temperature of the system.

Therefore we can see that Eq.( 181 ) is just the standard entropy for a
time-independent harmonic oscillator, however, the temperature here is
time-dependent. Thus we recover the time-dependence of the partition
function. Since the partition function is time-dependent, therefore the
entropy is also time-dependent.

### 16 Entropy

In terms of the partition function, the thermodynamic definition of
entropy is given by, see for example Ref. [ 24 ] ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (183)
  -- -------- -- -------

Using Eq.( 181 ), we can then write the entropy of the system as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (184)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, this is again just the entropy of the usual time-independent
harmonic oscillator. From Eq.( 182 ) it follows that the temperature is
time-dependent.

To be able to calculate the entropy of the domain wall we will consider
the entropy of the entire system, i.e. the domain wall and radiation,
and the radiation alone. We will assume that the total entropy is a
linear equation in the entropy of the domain wall and the entropy of the
radiation. Thus we will write the total entropy as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (185)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the subscripts @xmath stands for domain wall and radiation, @xmath
for just domain wall and @xmath radiation only, respectively. Then by
subtracting these two quantities one can then determine the entropy of
the domain wall

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (186)
  -- -------- -- -------

In Chapter \thechapter we considered the wavefunction and occupation
number of the radiation only system. To proceed further, we must now
consider the wavefunction and occupation number for the entire system,
@xmath .

#### 16.1 Entire System

To find the wavefunction and occupation number for the entire system, we
first note that from Eq.( 52 ) we can approximate the Hamiltonian of the
domain wall as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (187)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then using Eq.( 187 ) and Eq.( 117 ) we can write the Hamiltonian of the
entire system as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (188)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is given in Chapter \thechapter and @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (189)
  -- -------- -- -------

The wavefunction for the entire system is then a function of @xmath ,
@xmath , and @xmath , which we can write as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (190)
  -- -------- -- -------

Substituting Eq.( 188 ) into Eq.( 12 ), we can then write the Functional
Schrödinger equation as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (191)
  -- -------- -- -------

To solve Eq.( 191 ) we will use the semiclassical case, i.e. we will use
the classical background for the collapsing shell. Since the distance of
the shell only depends on the time, see Eq.( 60 ), we can then write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Hence, we are eliminating the @xmath dependence from Eq.( 190 ), so
@xmath . Rewriting gives

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (192)
  -- -------- -- -------

Making use of Eq.( 60 ), i.e. @xmath , this becomes

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (193)
  -- -------- -- -------

We now rewrite Eq.( 193 ) in the standard form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (194)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (195)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (196)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here we have chosen to set @xmath .

The solution to Eq.( 194 ) is given by Eq.( 16 ), as discussed in
Chapter \thechapter . We can then find the occupation number @xmath for
the entire system, Eq.( 33 ).

Here we will make some quick comments regarding the occupation number.
We can see that from Eqs.( 194 ) and ( 118 ), the Schrödinger equations
for the entire system and radiation only are of the same form. Hence one
would expect that there is no difference between the occupation number
for the entire system and the radiation only. However, the time
parameters @xmath and @xmath , given in Eqs.( 195 ) and ( 119 ), are
different. Hence the occupation numbers of the two systems will evolve
differently, which leads to different temperatures in each of the two
systems. Therefore, the entropy of each system will be different.

### 17 Analysis

First we consider the entropy of the entire system. In Figure 19 we plot
the entropy of the entire system as a function of dimensionless time
@xmath . Figure 19 shows that the system starts with an initial entropy
of zero. This is expected since initially there is only one degree of
freedom, meaning that @xmath . Here we have normalized the initial
entropy of the shell to be zero. To justify this normalization, consider
a solar mass black hole. Under the usual Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, the
order of magnitude estimate of the entropy of a solar mass black hole is
@xmath . Now consider that the shell is actually made up of protons. The
initial entropy of the shell then is approximately @xmath . Comparing
the entropy of the final black hole versus the initial entropy of the
shell, the entropy of the final black hole is much much greater than
that of the initial entropy of the shell, thus the initial entropy of
the shell only contributes a negligible amount of entropy to the entropy
of the final black hole. Thus our normalization of the initial entropy
of the shell to zero is justified. As @xmath increases, initially the
entropy increases rapidly, then settles down to increase approximately
linearly. Due to the linear increase, we see that as @xmath goes to
infinity, the entropy will then diverge. This is again expected since as
the asymptotic time goes to infinity, the number of particles that are
produced diverges (see Ref. [ 30 ] ). This is a consequence of the fact
that we keep the background fixed (i.e. @xmath is a constant). In
reality, @xmath should decrease over time since the radiation is taking
away mass and energy from the system. Therefore as @xmath goes to
infinity, the entropy of the entire system as measured by the asymptotic
observer diverges as @xmath .

This is consistent with the results found in Refs. [ 33 ] . Here the
authors consider the time-dependent non-equilibrium evolution of a black
hole as well as the incorporation of the given off radiation. Here one
can see that the entropy of the system diverges as the time goes to
infinity.

The results of Figure 19 are consistent with the generalized second law
of black hole thermodynamics. The generalized second law states that,
see for example Ref. [ 38 ] and references there in

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (197)
  -- -------- -- -------

where here, @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , respectively. Eq.( 197 ) simply
states that the total entropy of the system must constantly be
increasing as in agreement with thermodynamics entropy Ref. [ 24 ] . As
stated above, a realistic model for gravitational collapse will have
that the Schwarzschild radius @xmath will decrease over time, since the
domain wall is losing mass. Eq.( 197 ) allows for this result as long as
the entropy increase of the radiation compensates for the loss in
entropy of the collapsing domain wall.

Now we consider the radiation only. Considering just the particles which
are created, i.e. the radiation, during the collapse, we can then plot
the entropy as a function or the rescaled asymptotic time @xmath , see
Figure 20 . Figure 20 shows initially the entropy of the system is zero.
Again, this is expected since initially the domain wall is in vacuum,
meaning that there are no particles produced. Therefore the only degree
of freedom is that of the domain wall, this then gives that the initial
entropy must be zero. As the asymptotic observer time increases,
initially there is rapid increase in the entropy, but again, the entropy
then increases linearly as the asymptotic observer time increases. As in
the case of the entire system, as the time measured by the asymptotic
observer goes to infinity, the entropy of the particles created during
the time of collapse diverges. This is expected since the number of
particles which are created during the time of collapse diverges as
@xmath , hence as the domain wall approaches the horizon the number of
particles created during the collapse diverges. This result again is in
agreement with the generalized second law of black hole thermodynamics,
Eq.( 197 ).

In Figure 21 we plot the entropy as a function of the rescaled
asymptotic observer time @xmath of both the entire system and the
particles created during the time of collapse. Figure 21 shows that
except for the initial increase in the entropy, for later asymptotic
observer time, the slopes of the entropy versus time are approximately
equal. Therefore, one can expect that the entropy of the domain wall is
approximately constant for late times.

As stated earlier, what is of interest is the entropy of the collapsing
domain wall, since this will collapse to form a black hole. To find the
entropy of the domain wall, we can take the entropy of the entire system
and subtract off the entropy of the particles produced (since these are
the only relevant objects which contribute to the entropy), see Eq.( 201
). The result is then given in Figure 22 . Figure 22 shows that
initially the entropy of the domain wall is zero. As stated above, this
is expected since initially there is only one degree of freedom. As
asymptotic time increases, the entropy of the domain wall rapidly
increases. However, for late times, the entropy of the domain wall goes
to a constant. As stated above, this is expected since the late time
entropies for entire system and for the particles created during
collapse are approximately parallel. However, as discussed earlier, one
would expect that in a realistic model the entropy of the domain wall
should in fact decrease over time since @xmath is decreasing because the
domain wall is losing mass. The entropy here, however, is constant since
we are assuming that the mass is approximately the Hamiltonian of the
system, which is a constant of motion, see Chapters \thechapter and
\thechapter . This means that since we are holding the mass of the
domain wall constant, we need to keep adding energy to the system to
counter act the loss of mass from the Hawking radiation. Therefore one
can expect that the entropy of the domain wall must be a constant for
late times.

In reality, radiation takes mass away from the system, so the entropy of
the domain wall will go to zero as @xmath goes to zero. This means that
after the black hole disappears, all the entropy will go into the
entropy of the radiation, which is in agreement with the generalized
second law of black hole thermodynamics.

From Figure 22 , we see that our numerical value for the late time
entropy of the domain wall is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Comparing with Eq.( 172 ), we can view this discrepancy as a shift in
the Schwarzschild radius @xmath . In order to get the theoretical value
for the entropy, Eq.( 172 ), we see that we would require @xmath . This
is an understandable numerical error, which implies that our numerical
solution is of the same order as the Hawking-Bekenstein entropy.

Another interesting thing to note is that Figure 22 tells us that change
in entropy occurs for early times, then gets frozen as time increases.
From the plot we see that the change in entropy occurs during the time
range @xmath . At first sight this seems to be an arbitrary value for
the entropy of the domain wall to stop increasing. However, from Eq.( 61
) one can see that this time is not an arbitrary value.

To see this, let us first consider Eq.( 61 ) and make the requirement
that @xmath , where @xmath is some integer. Then we can write Eq.( 61 )
as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For illustration purposes let’s restrict the value of @xmath to be
@xmath , which is a restriction that the domain wall starts off at a
position ten times it’s Schwarzschild radius. In Figure 23 we plot
@xmath versus @xmath for various values of @xmath . For each value of
@xmath chosen, we see that the value @xmath occurs for @xmath . In the
case of @xmath , we see that @xmath , while the value is less than that
for smaller values of @xmath . Hence, the time @xmath seems to be a
universal time when the domain wall is almost to the Schwarzschild
radius. From Eq.( 60 ) we see that by this time we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Hence in this time limit, the velocity of the domain wall is
approximately zero, meaning that as far as the asymptotic observer is
concerned the domain wall has stopped moving and there are no more
dynamics. This can be seen in Figure 24 , where we plot the
corresponding velocities for the same values of @xmath . Figure 24 also
shows that the time @xmath corresponds to a universal time of when the
different velocities go approximately to zero. Recall from Chapter
\thechapter that it takes an infinite amount of time for the domain wall
to reach the horizon, so from @xmath to infinity the entropy is constant
since all the dynamics are essentially done and the shell is
approximately stationary for the observer. Hence the volume of the
spherically symmetric domain wall becomes essentially constant by the
time @xmath .

Second, we can show that the entire system and the induced radiation
come into thermal equilibrium at this time. In Figure 182 we plot @xmath
versus @xmath for the entire system (continuous curve) and the induced
radiation (dashed curve). Figure 182 shows that for the time @xmath the
values of the two @xmath ’s become approximately equal, meaning that the
entire system and the induced radiation are now at the same temperature.
Therefore the system is now in thermal equilibrium, meaning that there
is no more change in entropy of the domain wall as @xmath increases.
Further more, the fluctuations (departure from thermality) in @xmath
become very small at this time, as discussed in Refs. [ 30 , 32 ] .

Finally we can evaluate the the chemical potential for both the entire
system and for the induced radiation. From definition we can write the
chemical potential as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (198)
  -- -------- -- -------

In Figure 25 we plot the chemical potential for both the entire system
and for the induced radiation. We can see that as @xmath increases the
chemical potential of the entire system and the induced radiation goes
to zero. This means that the dispersion of particles goes to zero and
the system goes into equilibrium.

During the dynamical process, the entropy increases almost linearly. If
one applies a best-fit line, we see that the entropy oscillates about
the best line. These oscillations may be attributed to several different
circumstances. First, the oscillations may be caused by the non-thermal
property of the radiation (see Ref. [ 30 ] ). Secondly, these
oscillations may be a manifestation of the error associated with the
numerical calculations. Lastly, the oscillations may be an artifact of
expanding the calculations beyond the region of validity, since we are
using the near horizon approximation. Hence for values large compared to
@xmath , we cannot completely trust our result.

### 18 Discussion

Here we have shown that the entropy of the collapsing domain wall and
the entropy of the radiation given off during the time of collapse are
in agreement with the generalized second law of black hole
thermodynamics. The results of Figure 19 are clearly in agreement with
Eq.( 197 ). The results of Figure 22 are in agreement with the results
of Hawking and Gibbons, Eq.( 172 ), that the entropy of the black hole
is in fact finite and proportional to the area of the event horizon.

Note, here we do not discuss or explain the origin of Eq.( 172 ), we
merely verify that our model gives the correct result. The origin of
Eq.( 172 ) is still not understood, however, many attempts have been
made to make sense of this result (see for example Refs. [ 34 , 35 , 36
] ). However, the answer to this question may lie in understanding the
entanglement nature between the particles inside and outside of the
event horizon, see for example Refs. [ 39 , 40 , 41 ] .

## Chapter \thechapter Back Reaction

In this section we make some general comments on how one can include the
effect of back reaction for an infalling observer during gravitational
collapse. In this section we do not completely solve the equations of
motion for the included back reaction, we merely set up the situation
and make some comments about it.

To incorporate back reaction into gravitational collapse, one must
consider the entire Hamiltonian, as in Chapter \thechapter , as well as
the interaction Hamiltonian between the domain wall and the induced
radiation.

Thus the total Hamiltonian is given by

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (199)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the interaction Hamiltonian and @xmath and @xmath are
the energy-momentum tensors for the radiation and the domain wall,
respectively, which are given by

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (200)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (201)
  -- -------- -- -------

From the expansion of the scalar field in Eq.( 20 ), we can see that the
stress-energy tensor for the scalar field takes on the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (202)
  -- -------- -- -------

While from Eq.( 201 ) we see that the stress-energy tensor for the
domain wall takes the form,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (203)
  -- -------- -- -------

Hence we see that the interaction Hamiltonian doesn’t contain any
off-diagonal terms.

### 19 Stress-Energy Tensor

Here we develop the stress-energy tensor for the radiation and the
domain wall, respectively. First we will discuss the stress-energy
tensor for the induced radiation. Second we will discuss the
stress-energy tensor for the domain wall.

#### 19.1 Radiation Stress-Energy Tensor

Here we examine the stress-energy tensor for the radiation. From the
discussion in Chapter \thechapter we can write the stress-energy tensor
as

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
                          (204)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Now using the metric we can write the individual terms, which are given
as

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (205)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (206)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (207)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (208)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (209)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (210)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Here note that from Eqs.( 209 ) and ( 210 ) show that @xmath .

For a full analysis of the stress-energy tensor we will look in the near
the horizon limit. Ideally we would like to extend this analysis to the
near singularity limit as well. However, we are working in Schwarzschild
coordinates, which we cannot extend to the near singularity limit due to
the fact that the observer is being constantly accelerated (see Chapter
\thechapter ). We will then exam the behavior of the stress-energy
tensor near the horizon, i.e. in the region @xmath .

Of interest is the behavior of the stress-energy tensor near the
horizon. To investigate the effect of the radiation we will change the
limit of integration from @xmath to @xmath , allowing us to find the
dominate terms in this regime. From Eq.( 205 ) we see that in this limit
and with the expansion in modes we have

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

from Eq.( 206 )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

from Eq.( 207 )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

from Eq.( 208 )

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

and from Eq.( 209 ) we have

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where the matrices are defined by

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (211)
     @xmath   @xmath      (212)
     @xmath   @xmath      (213)
     @xmath   @xmath      (214)
     @xmath   @xmath      (215)
     @xmath   @xmath      (216)
     @xmath   @xmath      (217)
     @xmath   @xmath      (218)
     @xmath   @xmath      (219)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

To further investigate the problem, for a moment let us assume that the
basis functions are planewaves. This is a valid approximation in the
asymptotic regime, however, this will give us some insight into the
problem here. For the basis functions as plane waves we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

however since we are requiring real basis functions then we will take
the real part of this. Therefore we can write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Performing the integral over @xmath we then have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which is finite. Hence the other terms in Eqs.( 205 ), ( 208 ), ( 209 )
and ( 210 ) are dominate due to the divergences of these terms.
Therefore we can ignore these extra terms, so we then have

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

which is of the same form as @xmath . We can see that the matrices in
Eq.( 219 ) are just multiples of the matrices in Eq.( 135 ). Therefore
we can see that the eigenvalues of Eq.( 219 ) are multiples of those of
Eq.( 135 ), hence we can simultaneously diagonalize the matrices as we
did in Chapter \thechapter . Finally we can write

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (220)
     @xmath   @xmath      (221)
     @xmath   @xmath      (222)
     @xmath   @xmath      (223)
     @xmath   @xmath      (224)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where as in Chapter \thechapter , @xmath and @xmath are eigenvalues,
@xmath are the eigenmodes and @xmath is a constant multiple. Here we
note that @xmath , @xmath and @xmath have the structure of a Harmonic
oscillator.

We now calculate the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor. To
do this we consider

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (225)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the vacuum state. Since the components of the
stress-energy tensor have the structure of a harmonic oscillator we take
that the vacuum state is the ground state of the harmonic oscillator
(see Chapter \thechapter ). The ground state of the harmonic oscillator
is given by Eq.( 122 ), thus the expectation value is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (226)
  -- -------- -- -------

From the structure of Eqs.( 220 )-( 224 ), we can see that there is a
kinetic term and a potential term which all have the same dependence on
the eigenmode @xmath . So, using Eq.( 122 ) we can write

  -- -- -------- -------- --
        @xmath   @xmath   
        @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -- -------- -------- --

and

  -- -- -------- -------- --
        @xmath   @xmath   
        @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -- -------- -------- --

where we used the fact that there are an infinite number of eigenmodes
@xmath (hence the integrals are from zero to infinity). The individual
components are then,

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (227)
     @xmath               (228)
     @xmath   @xmath      (229)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Investigating Eqs.( 227 )-( 229 ) we can see that as @xmath the
potential term diverges such as in the Hamiltonian of the induced
radiation. Therefore we can conclude that the components of the
stress-energy tensor are divergent, however, not due to the usual
reasons. Typically this divergence of the stress-energy tensor is
associated with the divergence in the frequency @xmath (see for example
Refs. [ 28 , 29 , 23 ] ). To get around this divergence, one usually
either applies a cut-off for the allowed frequency or applies a
renormalization technique that makes the stress-energy tensor finite.
Here we can see that this process is not needed since the divergence is
not due to the frequency (since we never specify the basis functions),
however the divergence is due to the metric itself.

The divergence in Eqs.( 227 )-( 229 ) in the regime @xmath is due to the
@xmath term in the potential term. As stated earlier, Chapters
\thechapter and \thechapter , this is due to the fact that we are using
Schwarzschild coordinates. The Schwarzschild observer is in an
accelerated reference frame, which causes the divergence. Therefore, as
we saw in Chapter \thechapter , to study the question of backreaction
the more appropriate observer to use would be a truly free-falling
observer such as an Eddington-Finkelstein observer. However, we will not
investigate such an observer here.

#### 19.2 Stress-Energy of the domain wall

From Eq.( 201 ) we can write the determinant of the induced metric as

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (230)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where we used Eq.( 41 ). The stress-energy tensor for the domain can
then be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (231)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is again the induced metric on the surface of the domain
wall. This is expected from Eq.( 282 ) in the case of the domain wall (
@xmath ).

### 20 Quantum Hamiltonian

Here we wish to find an appropriate way to take into account the fact
that the mass of the domain wall is changing, due to the fact that the
radiation is taking mass away from the system. To do this we will follow
a technique that was first introduced in Ref. [ 43 ] .

Eq.( 46 ) tells us that the mass of the domain wall is approximately the
Hamiltonian, therefore we can write the Schwarzschild radius as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (232)
  -- -------- -- -------

The factor @xmath in the Hamiltonian for the radiation contains the
energy of the wall via the Schwarzschild radius. So we then have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (233)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the near horizon limit Eq.( 46 ) can be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (234)
  -- -------- -- -------

Assuming that the velocity at the horizon is small and dropping the
constant terms we can write this as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (235)
  -- -------- -- -------

Using Eq.( 232 ) we can then rewrite this as

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (236)
              @xmath      (237)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where in the second line we used Eq.( 64 ).

The total Hamiltonian in terms of a single mode then becomes

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (238)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Here we note an unusual property of Eq.( 238 ), the appearance of the
fractional derivatives. In general, fractional derivatives are
non-local, that is, one cannot say that the fractional derivative at a
point @xmath of a function @xmath depends only on the graph of @xmath
very near @xmath , see for example Ref. [ 44 ] . Therefore it is
expected that the theory of fractional derivatives involves some sort of
boundary conditions, involving information further out. The most general
definition of the fractional derivative is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (239)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here the first case is defined as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (240)
  -- -------- -- -------

while the third case is defined as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (241)
  -- -------- -- -------

Hence Eq.( 238 ) is an differential-integral equation.

The study of the behavior backreaction is therefore very complicated.
However, the interesting thing to point out here is that, similarly to
the investigation of the quantum mechanical effects studied in Chapter
\thechapter , the presence of the non-locality again emerges. However,
in Chapter \thechapter the non-locality was only present when
investigating the near classical singularity regime. Here, the non-local
effect is even present in the near horizon regime.

### 21 Discussion

In this chapter we investigated the stress-energy tensor for the
radiation given off during collapse as well as investigated a way to
include the loss of mass during this collapse. We found some interesting
properties of these two quantities.

First for the stress-energy tensor for the radiation, we found that the
expectation value for the stress-energy tensor is in fact infinite.
However, this is not due to the usual difficulties. Generally when one
investigates the stress-energy tensor, the infinities arise from the
basis function. Traditionally one assumes a plane-wave basis function
for the radiation, and the divergence is therefore due to the frequency
of the basis function. To avoid these infinities, one usually institutes
a cut-off frequency. Here, we do not have this problem. This is due to
the fact that we never actually specify our basis functions, hence we do
not have the problem of infinities in the basis function. The divergence
in this case is due to the presence of the @xmath in the potential term.
As @xmath , @xmath which causes the divergence. As stated in Chapters
\thechapter and \thechapter this is due to the fact that we are using
Schwarzschild coordinates, where the observer is being accelerated.

To include the loss of mass into the Hamiltonian of the system, we used
the technique originally developed in Ref. [ 43 ] . Here one uses the
approximation that the Hamiltonian of the domain wall is approximately
the mass of the domain wall. Therefore one can replace the mass in the
Schwarzschild radius by the Hamiltonian of the wall. Using this, we can
then rewrite the total Hamiltonian as in Eq.( 238 ). The interesting
thing here is that the Hamiltonian is now in terms of fraction, not
whole or partial, derivatives. By definition, fractional derivatives are
not strictly local quantities and will either give a differential or
integral equation depending on the sign of the fractional derivative. As
in Chapter \thechapter , we recover the non-locality of the quantum
effects during gravitational collapse. Unlike in Chapter \thechapter ,
these effects are now manifest even near the horizon.

## Chapter \thechapter Conclusion

In this thesis we have investigated quantum mechanical effects of
gravitational collapse by utilizing the time-dependent nature of the
Functional Schrödinger formalism. As stressed throughout this thesis,
the Functional Schrödinger formalism allows us to investigate the
intermediate regimes that the standard methods cannot. Therefore we can
obtain a better understanding of what is happening during the evolution
of the collapse, at least in the context of the Functional Schrödinger
formalism. As we have seen in the previous chapters, the effects in this
intermediate regime are robust and give good insight into the process of
collapse.

This thesis is not meant to be an exhaustive list of the different types
of gravitational collapse. Here we solely concentrated on a massive
domain wall, while ignoring all other observable quantities (such as
charge and angular momentum). However, one can “easily” incorporate
these observable into the system as well. For example, one can repeat
the steps above for the case of a massive-charged domain wall (i.e.
Reissner-Nordström). This has been done for the classical and quantum
solutions in Ref. [ 45 ] and for the semi-classical radiation in Ref. [
46 ] . The analysis can also be repeated for different topologies, other
than spherically symmetric domain walls, as well as for different
asymptotic space-times (such as de Sitter or anti-de Sitter). In Ref. [
47 ] the classical and quantum solutions are studied for a @xmath
-dimensional BTZ black string in AdS space. It is well know that a
@xmath -dimensional BTZ black string has the topology of a cylinder and
is asymptotic to AdS space-time, due to the negative cosmological
constant.

It is also important to note here that the Functional Schrödinger
formalism is not restricted to gravitational collapse. One could also
apply the formalism to expanding systems as well, which are essentially
collapsing systems in reverse. In this case, one can investigate an
expanding de Sitter or anti-de Sitter universe and consider the
radiation and entropy during the evolution of expansion. For subsequent
work on the radiation given off during expansion, see “Time dependent
fluctuations and particle production in cosmological de Sitter and
anti-de Sitter spaces,” by E. Greenwood, D. Dai and D. Stojkovic
(submitted for publication in Phys. Rev. D ). In the case of de Sitter
expansion, which is represented by the Freedman-Robertson-Walker metric,
the horizon is the largest comoving distance which light emitted now can
reach the observer at any time in the future. It is expected that that
de Sitter space can produce thermal radiation as well (for some counter
arguments see Refs. [ 48 , 49 ] ). In the case of anti-de Sitter
expansion, unlike de Sitter expansion, the space-time does not contain
an event horizon. Therefore, one would not expect thermal radiation with
a constant temperature. However, due to the time-dependent metric,
particle production is still expected. Here it is expected that after a
short time of expansion, the universe starts recollapsing and ends up
forming a black hole, see for example Refs. [ 50 , 51 ] . The Functional
Schrödinger formalism can be applied to these situations as well to help
shed light on these questions.

## Chapter \thechapter Invariant Method and the Schrödinger Equation

In this section we breifly review the invariant operator method
developed by Lewis and Reisenfeld in Ref. [ 2 ] as a solution to the
time-dependent Schrödinger Equation.

Consider a system whose Hamiltonian operator @xmath is an explicit
function of time, and assume the existence of another explicitly
time-dependent non-trivial Hermitian operator @xmath , which is
invariant. To say that @xmath is invariant means that @xmath satisfies
the Liouville-von Neumann equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (242)
  -- -------- -- -------

and since @xmath is Hermitian we have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (243)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here we will consider the analysis for a state vector @xmath , however,
in general this also works for a wavefunction since @xmath . We can then
write the Schrödinger equation as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (244)
  -- -------- -- -------

By operating with the left-hand side of Eq.( 242 ) on the state vector
and using the Schrödinger equation, we obtain the relation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (245)
  -- -------- -- -------

which implies that the action of the invariant operator on a Schrödinger
state vector produces another solution of the Schrödinger equation. In
general, this result is valid for any invariant, even if the invariant
involves the operation of time differentiation. However, for our
purposes, we shall consider invariants which do not involve time
differentiation. This choice allows one to derive simple and explicit
rules for choosing the phases of the eigenstates of @xmath such that
these states themselves satisfy the Schrödginer equation.

Assume that the invariant is one of a complete set of commuting
observables, so that there is a complete set of eigenstates of @xmath .
Denote the eigenvalues of @xmath by @xmath , and the orthonormal
eigenstates associated with a given @xmath by @xmath , where @xmath
represents all of the quantum numbers other than @xmath that are
necessary for specifying the eigenstates:

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (246)
     @xmath   @xmath      (247)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Since the invariant is Hermitian, the eigenvalues @xmath are real. They
are also time-independent as we shall now see. By differentiating Eq.(
246 ) with respect to time, we obtain

  -- -- -- -------
           (248)
  -- -- -- -------

Using Eq.( 242 ) we can write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (249)
  -- -------- -- -------

The scalar product of Eq.( 249 ) with a state @xmath is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (250)
  -- -------- -- -------

which then implies

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (251)
  -- -------- -- -------

Taking the scalar product of Eq.( 248 ) with @xmath , we obtain

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (252)
  -- -------- -- -------

Since the eigenvalues are time-independent, it is clear that the
eigenstates must be time-dependent.

To investigate the connection between the eigenstates of @xmath and the
solutions so the Schrödinger equation, we first write the equation of
motion of @xmath starting from Eq.( 248 ) and using Eq.( 252 ):

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (253)
  -- -------- -- -------

By taking the scalar production with @xmath and using Eq.( 250 ) to
eliminate

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (254)
  -- -------- -- -------

From this, for @xmath , we infer

  -- -- -- -------
           (255)
  -- -- -- -------

Eq.( 254 ) does not imply

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

If Eq.( 255 ) held for @xmath as well as for @xmath , then we would
immediately deduce that @xmath satisfies the Schrödinger equation, that
is @xmath is a special case of @xmath .

Note that the phase of @xmath has not been fixed by our definitions. We
are still free to multiply @xmath by an arbitrary time-dependent phase
factor. Thus, we can define a new set of eigenvectors of @xmath related
to our initial set by a time-dependent gauge transformation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (256)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the @xmath are arbitrary real functions of time. Because @xmath is
assumed not to contain time-derivative operators, the @xmath are
orthonormal eigenstates of @xmath just as are the @xmath . For @xmath ,
Eq.( 254 ) also holds for matrix elements taken with respect to the new
eigenstates. Each of the new eigenstates will statisfy the Schrödinger
if we choose the phases @xmath such that Eq.( 254 ) holds for @xmath .
This requirement is equivalent to the following first-order differential
equation for the @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (257)
  -- -------- -- -------

Since each of the new set of eigenstates of @xmath , @xmath , satisfies
the Schrödinger equation, the general solution is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (258)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the @xmath are time-independent coefficients. All of the state
vectors with which we have dealt so far are time-dependent, while in
Eq.( 258 ) we modified the notation to indicate the dependence on time
explicitly. The Schroödinger state vector is now denoted by @xmath and
the eigenstates of the invariant by @xmath .

Assume that in the remote past the Hamiltonian @xmath is a constant
operator @xmath having a complete, orthonormal set of time-independent
eigenstates @xmath , @xmath being a label for all relevant quantum
numbers and @xmath standing for “initial state.” Similiarly, assume that
in the remote future, the Hamiltonian is a constant operator @xmath and
it possesses time-independent eigenstates @xmath , @xmath labeling the
quantum numbers and @xmath standing for “final state.” The explicit time
variation of @xmath for intermediate times is arbitrary except for
piecewise continuity; in particular, we do not exclude the possibility
of variations rapid enough to render an analysis in terms of
quasistationary states of @xmath impossible.

We want to calculate the transition amplitude @xmath connecting an
initial state @xmath to a final state @xmath . Thus we consider the case
in which the Schrödinger state vector @xmath corresponds to an
eigenstate @xmath . The superposition coefficients of Eq.( 258 ) for
this problem are given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (259)
  -- -------- -- -------

from which we obtain

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (260)
  -- -------- -- -------

The transition amplitude is therefore given by

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (261)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

The properties of @xmath apply equally well to any operator that is an
invariant corresponding to a given @xmath . In general, for a system of
@xmath degrees of freedom, there is an infinite family of such
invariants, the members of which are functions of a set of @xmath
independent invariants. Two such invariants will, in general, have
different eigenstates, different time derivatives, and different
commutators with the Hamiltonian. However, one must arrive at the same
physical results no matter what invariant we use and, therefore, the
choice of which particular invariant to use may be made on the basis of
mathematical convenience. Here we demonstrate that the physical result
is independent of the choice of invariant, we give a direct proof that a
transition amplitude, such as in Eq.( 261 ) is indeed independent of our
choice of invariant.

Suppose that we have two complete orthonormal sets of states, @xmath and
@xmath , all of which satisfy the time-dependent Schrödinger equation;
and suppose that the states @xmath are eigenstates of one set of
operators, whose eigenvalues are labeled by @xmath , and that the states
@xmath are eigenstates of a different set of operators, whose
eigenvalues are labeled by @xmath . The transition amplitude @xmath can
be expressed as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (262)
  -- -------- -- -------

or as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (263)
  -- -------- -- -------

We want to show directly that these two expressions are the same. The
completeness of the states @xmath requires

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (264)
  -- -------- -- -------

Operating on this equation with @xmath , and using the facts that all of
the states satisfy the Schrödinger equation and that the states @xmath
are orthogonal, we obtain

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (265)
  -- -------- -- -------

Thus the quantity @xmath is independent of time. We now use the
completeness of the state @xmath and @xmath , Eq.( 265 ), and the
orthonormality of the states @xmath to rewrite Eq.( 262 ) as

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (266)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Thus, Eqs.( 262 ) and ( 263 ) are the same, as asserted.

Suppose for simplicity that the eigenstates of @xmath are nondegenerate,
so that the eigenvalue of @xmath is the only quantum number required for
describing the system. When this is so, as it is in our discussion of
the time-dependent harmonic oscillator, then it is particularly
convenient to choose an invariant having the property that it becomes
time-independent as @xmath so that the commutator @xmath vanishes. Then
the normalized eigenvectors of @xmath and @xmath are identical to within
constant phase factors. Consequently, we may choose the initial state
@xmath simply to be a eigenstate of @xmath , say @xmath . Eq.( 261 )
then reduces to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (267)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the transition probability is given by

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (268)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

As @xmath , the invariant operator @xmath in general remains
time-dependent and does not commute with the Hamiltonian. Therefore, the
state @xmath in Eq.( 268 ) is a superposition of eigenstates of @xmath ;
this is another expression of the fact that energy is not conserved in
our system.

From the structure of Eq.( 261 ), it is apparent that we may express the
transition amplitude as a matrix element of an @xmath matrix by writing

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (269)
  -- -------- -- -------

It is easily verified that this operator is unitary:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (270)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the special case that the Hamiltonian operators in the remote past
and distant future are identical, @xmath , so that the initial and final
states are the same set, we may define an elastic scattering operator
@xmath in the standard fashion:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (271)
  -- -------- -- -------

The operator @xmath describes the nondiagonal transitions just as @xmath
does, but subtracts a noninteracting part from the diagonal amplitudes
so that @xmath represents a “forward reaction amplitude” from the state
@xmath to the same state. The unitarity of the @xmath matrix implies

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (272)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is a statement of the optical theorem: the total reaction
probability is proportional to the imaginary part of the forward
reaction amplitude.

## Chapter \thechapter Gauss Codazzi

## Appendix A The Gauss-Codazzi Formalism

Here we wish to solve Einstein’s equations in the presence of
stress-energy sources confined to three-dimensional time-like
hypersurfaces for a general metric. Following the methods used by Ipser
and Sikivie, Ref. [ 4 ] , we shall use the Gauss-Codazzi formalism.

The Gauss-Codazzi equations relate the four-dimensional geometry of the
overall global space-time to their projection onto a three-dimensional
hypersurface embedded within the original four-dimensional space-time.
This is done by investigating the intrinsic and extrinsic curvature of
the three-dimensional time-like hypersurface. The Gauss-Codazzi
formalism allows one to find the equations of motion for a collapsing
domain wall in a very systematic way. To find the equations of motion,
one needs to specify the metric (and associated energy-momentum tensor)
only.

In this chapter we wish to develop the Gauss-Codazzi formalism for a
general metric where the only initial requirement is that the
coefficients of the metric depend on position and time only. We will
then arrive a final equation which depends on the coefficient (and
derivatives of), as well as its associated energy-momentum tensor, which
will allow us to find the equations of motion for the collapsing domain
wall once the metric is completely specified. After we develop the
general equations, we will compare our result with that found in the
literature for two different specified metrics: the Schwarzschild and
Reissner-Nordström metrics, respectively. The Schwarzschild and
Reisner-Norström metric coefficients both depend on position only, hence
these are an example of a special case of the general method we are
working with here.

#### a.1 The Equations

Here we follow the technologies developed in Ref. [ 4 ] . Let @xmath
denote a three-dimensional time-like hypersurface containing
stress-energy and let @xmath be its unit spacelike normal ( @xmath ).
The three-metric intrinsic to the hypersurface @xmath is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (273)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the four-metric of the space-time. Here @xmath is known
as the projected tensor for the hypersurface @xmath , see Ref. [ 25 ] .
This is due to the fact that, when acting @xmath on a vector @xmath , it
will project it tangent to the hypersurface, hence orthogonal to @xmath
,

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

Let @xmath denote the covariant derivative associated with @xmath and
let

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (274)
  -- -------- -- -------

hence @xmath is the covariant derivative on the induced
three-dimensional hypersurface. The extrinsic curvature of @xmath ,
denoted by @xmath , is defind by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (275)
  -- -------- -- -------

The extrinsic curvature depends on how the hypersurface is embedded in
the full four-dimensional space-time. The extrinsic curvature is used to
differentiate different topologies. For example, intrinsic geometry of a
cylinder and a torus can be flat, however, we know the exterior geometry
of each is different. This different topology is given in the extrinsic
curvature, which will tell us that we are actually on a torus or a
cylinder.

The contracted forms of the first and second Gauss-Codazzi equations are
then given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (276)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (277)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Here @xmath is the Ricci scalar curvature of the three-geometry @xmath
of @xmath , @xmath is the trace of the extrinsic curvature, and @xmath
is the Einstein tensor in four-dimensional space-time.

Here we will be working with infinitely thin domain walls. The
stress-energy tensor @xmath of four-dimensional space-time then is
assumed to have a @xmath -function singularity on @xmath . This in turn
implies that the extrinsic curvature has a jump discontinuity across
@xmath , since the extrinsic curvature is analogous to the gradient of
the Newtonian gravitational potential. Therefore we can introduce

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (278)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is the difference between the exterior and interior extrinsic
curvatures, and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (279)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the proper distance through @xmath in the direction of
the normal @xmath , and where the subscripts @xmath refer to values just
off the surface on the side determined by the direction of @xmath .
Hence the direction for, say @xmath will be in the direction of the
exterior geometry of the domain wall, while @xmath will denote the
direction of the interior geometry of the domain wall. As we shall
discuss below, these geometries will be different for the case of the
spherically symmetric domain wall. Using Einstein’s and the
Gauss-Codazzi equations, one can show that (see Ref. [ 7 ] )

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (280)
  -- -------- -- -------

We can also introduce the “average” extrinsic curvature

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (281)
  -- -------- -- -------

which will be important later.

#### a.2 The Surface Stress-Energy Tensor

Here we restrict ourselves to sources for which the stress energy tensor
is given by, see Ref. [ 4 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (282)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is the material sources consisting of a perfect fluid. In Eq.( 282
) @xmath is the four-velocity of any observer whose world line lies
within @xmath and who sees no energy flux in his local frame, and where
@xmath is the energy per unit area and @xmath is the tension measured by
the observer. For a dust wall it is well known that @xmath , while for a
domain wall @xmath . For a domain wall Eq.( 282 ) reduces to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (283)
  -- -------- -- -------

We also note that the four-velocity @xmath is a time-like unit vector
orthogonal to the space-like unit normal @xmath , i.e.,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

#### a.3 Attractive Energy

Here we derive equations for an observer who is hovering just above the
surface @xmath on either side. Let the vector field @xmath be extended
off @xmath in a smooth fashion. The acceleration

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (284)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

has a jump discontinuity across @xmath since the extrinsic curvature has
such a discontinuity. The perpendicular components of the accelerations
of observers hovering just off @xmath on either side satisfy

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (285)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (286)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Here we comment on the precense of the second term on the right hand
side of Eq.( 285 ). This term takes into account the contributions to
the energy-tensor @xmath which are present in the vacuo on opposite
sides of @xmath . For example, if there is only mass present, then
@xmath vanishes off the shell, hence the second term is zero. In the
case of charge present, then @xmath does not vanish, then the
contribution to @xmath outside can be taken from the Maxwell tensor.

## Appendix B Spherical Walls

In this section we shall obtain the asymptotically flat solutions to
Einstein’s equations for spherically symmetric domain walls with an
arbitrary metric. Here we will consider two cases. First we will
consider the case where the metric coefficients only depend on the
radial position of the domain wall. Second, we will consider the case
where the metric coefficients depend on both the radial position of the
domain wall and the time.

#### b.1 Radial dependence only

For a spherical shell of stress-energy, let the unit normal @xmath point
in the outward radial direction. It is well known that asymptotic
flatness and spherical symmetry requires that the interior geometry is
flat (Birkhoff’s theorem). For the external geometry we will choose an
arbitrary metric. First we shall consider the case where the
coefficients only depend on position. Hence,

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (287)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (288)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (289)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here the equation of the wall is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (290)
  -- -------- -- -------

One finds for the components of @xmath and @xmath @xmath or @xmath , in
that order @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (291)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Here @xmath , where @xmath is the propertime of an observer moving with
four-velocity @xmath at the wall, and

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (292)
     @xmath   @xmath      (293)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

However, here we should comment that the condition that @xmath is of
unit normal, this then implies the condition that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (294)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore we can rewrite Eq.( 293 ) as

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (295)
     @xmath   @xmath      (296)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

These expressions and the definitions Eqs.( 274 ), ( 275 ) and ( 281 )
imply that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (297)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (298)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (299)
  -- -------- -- -------

Substituting into Eqs.( 285 ) and ( 286 ) then yields the equations of
motion

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (300)
     @xmath   @xmath      (301)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Taking the ratio of Eqs.( 300 ) and ( 301 ) allows us to eliminate
@xmath from the expression, so we then find

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (302)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here we make some general comments on Eqs.( 300 ) and ( 301 ). First, in
the absence of stress-energy outside the domain wall, @xmath is always
negative provided @xmath . Hence a spherical domain wall with, say only
mass, with @xmath will always collapse to a black hole, regardless of
its size. Second, in the presence of stress-energy outside the domain
wall, @xmath is always positive provided that the source term is small
compared to the other terms. However, if the source term is large
compared to the other terms, @xmath can become positive at some point.
This means that the collapsing object will turn around and begin to
expand.

Eq.( 302 ) allows us to find the equations of motion for a specific
geometry, provided that the coefficient @xmath , i.e. is only a function
of position. In the next section we demonstrate the findings in Eq.( 302
) for two specific cases found in the literature. This will allow us to
demonstrate ease of the general form of the equations of motion.

#### b.2 Radial and Time dependence

In this section we will write the exterior metric, Eq.( 287 ), as

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (303)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where we will maintain that the interior metric is still given by the
Minkowski line element. We will again take that the equation of the wall
is given by Eq.( 290 ), this then gives that the components of @xmath
and @xmath are unchanged in form from Eq.( 291 ). Note however that one
does have to make the change from @xmath and @xmath to @xmath and @xmath
, respectively. As in the case of radial dependence only, the condition
that @xmath is a normalized space-like vector, we again have the
condition that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (304)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore we define @xmath and @xmath in the same manner as in the case
with only radial dependence, using the suitable substitution.

We can then find that the acceleration outside and inside the domain
wall are given by

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (305)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is given in Eq.( 299 ) and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (306)
  -- -------- -- -------

Comparing the acceleration outside the domain wall for the radial and
time dependent metric coefficient, Eq.( 305 ), to that of the
acceleration outside the domain wall for the radially dependent metric
coefficient, Eq.( 298 ), we see that the acceleration outside the domain
in the new case is just the acceleration in the radial case modified by
an additional term which depends on @xmath -derivatives of the metric
coefficient. This is not an unexpected result.

Substituting Eq.( 305 ) into Eqs.( 285 ) and ( 286 ) then yields the
equations of motion

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (307)
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (308)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Taking the ratio of Eqs.( 307 ) and ( 308 ) allows us to eliminate
@xmath from the expression, so we then find

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (309)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Here we make some general comments on Eqs.( 307 ) and ( 308 ). First, we
again see that the first three terms in Eq.( 307 ) and the first two
terms in Eq.( 308 ) are identical to the radially dependent metric
coefficients only, where the last term comes from the time dependence of
the metric coefficients. Second, it is not as obvious in this case the
behavior of the domain wall. In the case of gravitational collapse,
@xmath , making the last term positive.

## Appendix C Examples

In this section we present some examples using the equation of motion in
Eq.( 302 ). First, we will investigate the case of a massive domain
wall. We will show that Eq.( 302 ) automatically leads to the equation
of motion arrived at by Ipser and Sikivie, see Ref. [ 4 ] . Second, we
will investigate the case of a massive-charged domain wall. We will show
that Eq.( 302 ) automatically leads to the equation of motion arrived at
by López, see Ref. [ 6 ] .

Here we note that the usual procedure for determining the metric
coefficients is to consider the asymptotic region of space-time (see for
example Ref. [ 42 ] ). Here one writes the Ricci tensor, which gives the
equations of motion for the the metric coefficients. Then using the
asymptotic requirements of the space-time, one integrates the equations
of motion for the metric coefficients and fixes the integration
constant. As stated above, we will just start with the metric
coefficients to find the conserved quantities for the collapsing domain
wall.

#### c.1 Massive Domain Wall

It is well known that asymptotic flatness and spherical symmetry require
the exterior geometry to be Schwarzschild. Therefore we can write Eq.(
287 ), the exterior metric, as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (310)
  -- -------- -- -------

Comparing the Schwarzschild metric with Eq.( 287 ), one can then
identify

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (311)
  -- -------- -- -------

Since the domain wall only contains mass, the stress-energy is only
present on the domain wall. Hence @xmath vanishes outside of the domain
wall. Therefore using Eq.( 302 ) we can immediately write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (312)
  -- -------- -- -------

or rearranging the terms we have

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (313)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where in the second line we use the definition of @xmath and @xmath ,
Eqs.( 295 ) and ( 296 ) respectively. This is identical to Eq.(3.8) in
Ref. [ 4 ] , for the case of the massive domain wall.

#### c.2 Massive-Charged Domain Wall

Since the domain wall is charged, and spherically symmetric, the
geometry outside the domain wall is given by the Reissner-Nordström
solution to Einstein equations. Therefore we can write Eq.( 287 ), the
exterior metric, as

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (314)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Comparing the Reissner-Nordström metric with Eq.( 287 ), one can then
identify

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (315)
  -- -------- -- -------

In this case the domain wall contains both mass and charge, thus the
stress-energy outside of the shell is taken from Maxwell’s tensor, since
the inside portion of the spherically symmetric domain wall will not
feel the influence of the charge. The only nonvanishing components
outside the domain wall are

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (316)
  -- -------- -- -------

By taking the difference of Eq.( 276 ) on opposite sides of @xmath , one
finds

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (317)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore using Eq.( 302 ) we can write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (318)
  -- -------- -- -------

Although this is an algebraic equation of second degree in @xmath , only
one of the two roots holds

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (319)
  -- -------- -- -------

which, using Eqs.( 295 ) and ( 296 ) can be put in the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (320)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, solving for the mass yields

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (321)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is identical to Eq.(61) in Ref. [ 6 ] , for the case of the
massive-charged domain wall.

## Chapter \thechapter @xmath Equation

This work was originally completed in Ref. [ 30 ] , here we will outline
the results.

In the range @xmath , @xmath is a constant and the solution to Eq.( 17 )
is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (322)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the range of interest, during the time of gravitational collapse, we
do not have an analytical solution to Eq.( 17 ). However, we can find
certain useful properties of @xmath . First note that in terms of @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (323)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then after rescaling, Eq.( 17 ) can be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (324)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , @xmath . The boundary conditions are then

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (325)
  -- -------- -- -------

The last term in Eq.( 324 ) becomes singular as @xmath . We can then
consider a more well behaved function for @xmath . For example

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (326)
  -- -------- -- -------

with boundary conditions

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (327)
  -- -------- -- -------

Eq.( 326 ) implies that @xmath is a monotonically decreasing function as
long as @xmath . Furthermore, it is decreasing faster than the solution
for @xmath as long as @xmath , since the @xmath in Eq.( 324 ) is a
larger “repulsive” force than the @xmath term in Eq.( 326 ). So

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (328)
  -- -------- -- -------

for all @xmath such that @xmath .

Eq.( 326 ) with initial conditions Eq.( 327 ) can be solved in terms of
degenerate hypergeometric functions. The important part for us is that
@xmath is positive for all @xmath and, in particular, @xmath for all the
values of @xmath that we have checked. Therefore @xmath is positive, at
least for a wide range of @xmath .

We can find some more properties of @xmath . Let @xmath . Then the
equation for @xmath can be expanded near @xmath .

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (329)
  -- -------- -- -------

This shows that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (330)
  -- -------- -- -------

as @xmath .

Hence @xmath is strictly positive and finite while @xmath for finite and
non-zero @xmath . Since @xmath and @xmath for @xmath , we also see that
@xmath and @xmath as @xmath .

In the range @xmath , @xmath is a constant. However, the solution for
@xmath is not constant, unlike in the range @xmath , since the constant
solution @xmath does not necessarily match up with @xmath to ensure a
continuous solution. Yet it is easy to check that in this range @xmath
and so there is no change in the occupation numbers. So we need only
find @xmath to determine @xmath .

## Chapter \thechapter @xmath Equation

To get an understanding of the number of particles created in the region
near the horizon we need to investigate the behavior of the function
@xmath near the Schwarzschild radius.

Near the horizon we can then write the velocity term as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (331)
  -- -------- -- -------

In this limit the position of the shell is then, from Eq.( 68 )

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (332)
  -- -------- -- -------

where, as stated in Chapter \thechapter , @xmath is the initial position
of the shell, we can write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (333)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore the frequency becomes

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (334)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore the auxiliary equation becomes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

or using Eq.( 141 ) we can write this as,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (335)
  -- -------- -- -------

After rescaling we can write this as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (336)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , and @xmath . The boundary conditions are then

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (337)
  -- -------- -- -------

The last term with the @xmath becomes singular as @xmath . Let us
consider another equation with this term replaced by another more well
behaved function. For example consider,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (338)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the boundary conditions in Eq.( 337 ) become

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (339)
  -- -------- -- -------

Eq.( 338 ) implies that @xmath is a monotonically decreasing function as
long as @xmath . It is decreasing faster than the solution for @xmath as
long as @xmath , since the @xmath term in Eq.( 336 ). Therefore we have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (340)
  -- -------- -- -------

for all @xmath such that @xmath .

The solution for @xmath is positive for all @xmath and, in particular,
@xmath for all the values @xmath that we have checked. Therefore @xmath
is positive, at least for a wide range.

Let @xmath . Then the Eq.( 336 ) can be expanded near @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (341)
  -- -------- -- -------

Integrating Eq.( 341 ) we can then write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (342)
  -- -------- -- -------

as @xmath . Hence @xmath is strictly positive and finite while @xmath
for finite and non-zero @xmath .

We are calculating the occupation number @xmath as a function of
frequency @xmath at some fixed time. From Eq.( 334 ) we see that, in
order to keep @xmath fixed in time, @xmath as @xmath . Thus, @xmath
varies with @xmath and not with time. Since @xmath , and @xmath for
@xmath , we see that @xmath and @xmath as @xmath . This implies taht the
occupation number in Eq.( 33 ) diverges as @xmath since @xmath as @xmath
.
