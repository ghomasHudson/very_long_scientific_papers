## Chapter 1 Introduction

Let @xmath be a closed or finite volume Riemannian manifold of dimension
@xmath . The volume entropy of @xmath is defined as:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is any point in the Riemannian universal cover @xmath of
@xmath , and where @xmath is the volume of the ball of radius @xmath
centered at @xmath . It is well known from the work of Manning (see [
Man79 ] ) that this quantity does not depend on @xmath , and in the
compact case is related to the topological entropy of the geodesic flow
of @xmath , denoted @xmath ; namely, @xmath , and the equality holds if
@xmath is non-positively curved. On the other hand, @xmath can even be
greater then @xmath for negatively curved, finite volume manifolds, see
[ DPPS09 ] .
It is readily seen that the volume entropy scales as the inverse of
@xmath , hence one obtains a scale invariant by setting:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The minimal entropy @xmath is thus defined as:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath varies among all Riemannian metrics on @xmath . It turns
out that this is a homotopy invariant, as shown in [ Bab92 ] .

Notice that if @xmath is not compact it makes sense to define the
Minimal Entropy in the same way as for closed manifolds, except that we
shall take the infimum over all the complete, Riemannian metrics of
volume @xmath on @xmath .

The computation of @xmath , when nonzero, is in general hard, and is
known only for very few classes of manifolds. In the middle seventies,
Katok computed the @xmath of every closed surface @xmath of genus @xmath
, namely, @xmath , see [ Kat82 ] (when @xmath trivially, the fundamental
group being of sub-exponential growth). Moreover, he proved that, in
this case, the infimum is indeed a minimum, and it is realized precisely
by the hyperbolic metrics. Katok’s main interest was computing the
topological entropy (see [ Man79 ] ) and the proof uses techniques of
dynamical systems. Moreover, its proof strongly relies on the
Uniformization Theorem for surfaces, so cannot be generalized to higher
dimensions.

The following major step was made by Besson, Courtois and Gallot, who in
the middle ’90s proved the following theorem, showing in particular that
locally symmetric metrics of strictly negative curvature are
characterized by being minima of the volume-entropy functional on any
closed manifold @xmath (provided that such a metric exists on @xmath ),
in any dimension, as conjectured by Katok and Gromov, see [ Gro83 ] .

###### Theorem 1.1 ([Bcg95]).

Let @xmath and @xmath be closed, connected, oriented manifolds of the
same dimension @xmath , and let @xmath be a continuous map of non-zero
degree. Suppose @xmath endowed with a locally symmetric metric @xmath
with negative curvature. Then for every Riemannian metric on @xmath the
following inequality holds:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

Furthermore, if @xmath the equality holds if and only if @xmath is
homothetic to a Riemannan covering @xmath .

The main tool behind the result of Besson, Courtois and Gallot is the so
called barycenter method , a technique that was broadly used in other
works by several authors, see [ BCG96 ] , [ BCG99 ] , [ BCS05 ] , [ CS ]
, [ Mer16 ] , [ PS17 ] , [ Sam99 ] , [ Sto06 ] . Recently, Merlin
computed the minimal entropy of the compact quotients of the polydisc
@xmath , using the original idea, already present in [ BCG95 ] , of
explicitly constructing a calibrating form (see [ Mer16 ] ).
In this thesis we will be concerned with the case where @xmath is a
closed, orientable @xmath -manifold. Every closed, orientable @xmath
-manifold admits a @xmath -step topological decomposition: namely, it
can be firstly decomposed as the connected sum of prime manifolds ( i.e.
, not decomposable as non trivial connected sum), and then each of these
summands can be further decomposed, along suitable embedded
incompressible ¹ ¹ 1 An embedded surface @xmath in a closed, orientable
@xmath -manifold is called incompressible if, for every disc @xmath such
that @xmath , then @xmath bounds a disc in @xmath . tori, in @xmath
pieces . Furthermore, each of the pieces (manifolds with boundary)
arising from this decomposition is either a Seifert manifold , or is
homotopically atoroidal (see Section 2.1 ) and its interior can be
endowed with a complete, hyperbolic metric of finite volume: this is the
content of Thurston’s Hyperbolization Theorem in the Haken case (see [
Thu82 ] , [ Thu86 ] , [ Thu98a ] , [ Thu98b ] , [ Ota96 ] , [ Ota98 ]
and [ Kap01 ] ), now fully proved in all generality by the work of
Perelman, see [ Per02 ] , [ Per03a ] , [ Per03b ] ; see also the book [
BBM @xmath 10 ] for a more detailed discussion of Perelman’s results. In
this @xmath -dimensional context, the work by Anderson and Paternain [
AP03 ] implies that @xmath vanishes for every Seifert manifold —and,
more generally, for every graph manifold , i.e. , a prime @xmath
-manifold admitting no hyperbolic pieces in its @xmath decomposition.
However, the general behaviour of @xmath with respect to the prime and
the @xmath decomposition was not known. In [ AP03 ] , Anderson and
Paternain —probably inspired by the behaviour of the topological
entropy— conjectured that, if @xmath is a closed, irreducible and
orientable @xmath -manifold, its @xmath equals the maximum of the
entropies of the complete, possibly non compact hyperbolic pieces. While
this turns out to be true in the case where there is only one @xmath
-component of hyperbolic type —as a consequence of our Theorem 1.2 — we
will show that the cube of @xmath is actually additive in the prime
summands and in the @xmath pieces.

###### Theorem 1.2.

Let @xmath be a closed, orientable, connected @xmath -manifold:

-    If @xmath is irreducible, let @xmath be its decomposition in @xmath
    components, where for @xmath the @xmath ’s are the hyperbolic @xmath
    components, whose interior can be endowed with the complete, finite
    volume, hyperbolic metric @xmath (unique up to isometry), while for
    @xmath the component @xmath is Seifert. Then:

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (1.2)
      -- -------- -- -------

-    If Y is reducible, namely @xmath then:

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (1.3)
      -- -------- -- -------

For open manifolds which admit complete Riemannian metrics of finite
volume it makes sense to define the Volume Entropy along the same line
of the closed case restricting to the metrics of finite volume. It is
worth noting that, with this definition, the Minimal Entropy is allowed
to be equal to @xmath . In [ Sto06 ] Storm proved that when @xmath is a
manifold which admits a complete, finite volume, locally symmetric
metric of rank @xmath , then such a metric realizes the Minimal Entropy
of @xmath . Furthermore, if an open manifold admits volume-collapsing
with bounded curvature (as it is the case of Seifert fibred manifolds
fibering over hyperbolic orbifolds) its Minimal Entropy vanishes.
Moreover, for those open manifolds admitting a finite volume metric and
whose fundamental group has polynomial growth it is readily seen that
the Minimal Entropy is equal to @xmath , a volume-collapsing sequence
being provided by rescaling the finite volume metric by smaller and
smaller constants (it is the case of @xmath ). Hence, in view of the
definition of Minimal Entropy for open manifolds and thanks to Storm’s
work we see that part a) of Theorem 1.2 can be read as an Additivity
Theorem.

Additivity Theorem. Let @xmath be an irreducible, closed, orientable
@xmath -manifold and let @xmath be the @xmath components of @xmath .
Then:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It is worth observing that our computation allow us to state that, for
every connected, orientable, closed @xmath -manifold @xmath , the
simplicial volume @xmath and @xmath are thus proportional invariants,
the constant of proportionality depending only on the dimension @xmath .
² ² 2 Recall that for every closed, orientable @xmath -manifold @xmath ,
the simplicial volume is defined as: @xmath where @xmath is the
fundamental class of @xmath and the infimum is taken over all real
cycles @xmath representing @xmath . Actually Gromov’s Additivity Theorem
(see [ Fri17 ] , Theorem 7.6 and references in there), and Gromov’s
computation of the simplicial volume of finite volume hyperbolic
manifolds ( [ Gro82 ] , §0.3), together with the vanishing of the
(relative) simplicial volume on Seifert fibred manifolds and the
additivity of the simplicial volume with respect to the connected sum
(see [ Gro82 ] , §3.5) yield the well known formula:

Gromov’s Formula For every closed, orientable, connected @xmath
-manifold @xmath , whose prime decomposition is @xmath , for every
@xmath denote the hyperbolic @xmath components of @xmath by @xmath ,
endowed with the complete, finite volume metric @xmath . Then:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the volume of an ideal regular geodesic simplex ³ ³ 3 A
geodesic simplex in @xmath is said to be ideal if all its vertices lie
in @xmath , and regular if every permutation of its vertices is induced
by an isometry of @xmath . in @xmath .

Hence, from Theorem 1.2 and Formula 1.2 we obtain the following:

###### Corollary 1.3.

For every closed, orientable @xmath -manifold @xmath we have:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Some of the ideas to prove part @xmath of Theorem 1.2 have been
developed in the PhD thesis of Souto (see [ Sou01 ] ), with whom we are
in debt for explaining us the overall strategy. However Souto’s work
relies on a result (presented as a consequence of Leeb’s argument [
Lee95 ] ), which is given without proof (see Proposition 8, [ Sou01 ] ).
As we shall explain later in Section LABEL:section_the_extension_problem
, Leeb’s construction of non-positively curved metrics on irreducible
@xmath -manifolds with non-trivial @xmath -decomposition and at least
one hyperbolic @xmath -component does not ensure, alone, a sufficiently
precise control on the geometric invariants which are needed for the
estimate of @xmath in the irreducible case; we shall give all the
necessary details for the construction of these metrics in Chapter
LABEL:section_a_conjectural_minimizing_sequence_irreducible , where a
precise estimate on the sectional curvatures and the volumes of each
@xmath component is given. To prove @xmath , we endow @xmath with a
sequence of @xmath , non-positively curved Riemannian metrics, which
look more and more like hyperbolic metrics with cusps on the @xmath
components of hyperbolic type, and shrink the volumes of the
non-hyperbolic @xmath -components. Then we adapt a slightly different
version of the barycentre method, using the square of the distance
function instead of the Busemann functions (as developed in [ Sam99 ] )
which avoids the analythical difficulty of considering measures on the
ideal boundary, and obtaining the sharp lower estimate of @xmath given
by Equations ( 1.2 ) and ( 1.3 ).

The case @xmath of reducible manifolds @xmath is achieved through a
direct computation applied to a suitable, geometrically well-chosen
sequence of metrics which expand the horospherical collars to long and
arbitrarily thin tubes: we can then decompose optimally the Poincaré
series of @xmath as a geometric series with common ratio given by the
Poincaré series of the summands @xmath .

The paper is organized as follows. In Chapter 2 we recall some basics on
the topology of Seifert manifolds and the construction of geometric
metrics on them. In particular, in Section 2.2 we focus on the @xmath
-decomposition Theorem for irreducible manifolds, and the geometries
carried by the @xmath components. Chapter
LABEL:section_a_conjectural_minimizing_sequence_irreducible is devoted
to obtain the upper estimate of @xmath in the case where @xmath is
irreducible, by explicitly exhibiting a (conjecturally) minimizing
sequence of metrics. In Chapter 3 we will get the (sharp) upper estimate
for reducible manifolds. In Chapters 4 and 5 we shall prove the lower
estimate of @xmath in the irreducible and reducible case, respectively.
In both cases, the cornerstone of the proof is the barycentre method
developed by Besson, Courtois and Gallot (see [ BCG95 ] , [ BCG96 ] , [
BCG99 ] ). In particular, in Chapter 5 we will prove that the barycentre
is also defined in the case where the target space is a @xmath metric
space —and not a non-positively curved manifold, as in the classical
setting— and apply it to a specific @xmath space constructed starting
from the manifold @xmath . Appendix A is devoted to some standard
notions about smooth and Riemannian orbifolds, which will be needed in
the construction of the minimizing sequence of metrics. Appendix B
contains the proof of some technical lemmata and propositions exploited
in Chapter LABEL:section_a_conjectural_minimizing_sequence_irreducible .

## Chapter 2 Basics of Geometry and Topology of @xmath-manifolds

### 2.1 Topology of Seifert fibred manifolds

This section is devoted to introduce some basic facts and definitions
about the topology of Seifert manifolds. A complete treatise of this
topic is far from the aim of this paper: for more details, we recommend
the book by Thurston [ Thu97 ] , the surveys by Scott [ Sco83 ] ,
Bonahon [ Bon02 ] , and the book by Martelli [ Mar16 ] .

#### 2.1.1 Fibered tori

In this section we shall introduce Seifert fibred manifolds; our
exposition is based on the work by Scott, see [ Sco83 ] for full
details. Informally, a Seifert fibred manifold is a @xmath -manifold
which can be described as the disjoint union of circles, called fibres,
satisfying some additional properties. In order to make this notion
precise, we need to give some preliminary definitions. A trivial fibred
solid torus is @xmath endowed with the standard foliation by circles,
i.e. , the foliation whose fibres are of type @xmath for @xmath . A
fibred solid torus is a solid torus with a foliation by circles which is
finitely covered (as a circle foliation) by a trivial fibred solid
torus. This object can be realized as follows: take a trivial fibred
solid torus, cut it along a meridian disk @xmath for some point @xmath ,
rotate through @xmath of a full turn, where @xmath and @xmath are
coprime integers, one of the two discs obtained via this procedure, and
glue these discs back together, see Figure 2.1 . The resulting fibred
solid torus @xmath has a @xmath -fold covering which is a trivial fibred
solid torus.

#### 2.1.2 Seifert fibered manifolds

Now we recall some basic facts about Seifert manifolds. We can define a
Seifert manifold as a @xmath -manifold @xmath with a decomposition into
disjoint circles, called fibers , such that every fibre has a
neighbourhood in @xmath which is a union of fibres, and is fiberwise
isomorphic to a fibred solid torus. Clearly any circle bundle over a
surface is a Seifert manifold. It follows by the definition that a
Seifert manifold is foliated by circles. Furthermore, Epstein (see [
Eps72 ] ) proved that the converse statement holds for compact,
orientable @xmath -manifolds; namely, any foliation by circles of a
compact, orientable @xmath -manifold is a Seifert fibration. ¹ ¹ 1
Epstein actually proved this result for compact @xmath -manifolds,
possibly not orientable. However, this requires to consider a more
general notion of Seifert fibrations, admitting that the neighbourhood
in @xmath of a fibre is a fibred Klein bottle . For our purposes we are
interested only in the orientable case. To start with, we want to
determine when two fibered solid tori @xmath and @xmath are isomorphic (
i.e. , they are homeomorphic through a homeomorphism which preserves the
fibration). It follows from the previous description that in a fibred
solid torus @xmath all the fibres but the central one represent @xmath
times the generator of @xmath , and wind @xmath times around the central
fibre. It is not hard to prove that if @xmath and @xmath are isomorphic,
then @xmath and @xmath . We observe that the operation of cutting @xmath
along a meridian disc and gluing it back with a full @xmath twist
affects @xmath adding an integer multiple of @xmath . Hence @xmath is an
invariant of the fibred solid torus @xmath , while @xmath can be made an
invariant of @xmath provided that we take @xmath . Furthermore, if we
orient the solid tori and care about other orientations, we need only to
normalise @xmath so that @xmath in order to obtain an invariant of
oriented fibred solid tori. The invariants @xmath normalised in this way
are called orbital invariants of the central fibre. We use the following
orientation convention. Given an oriented manifold @xmath , its boundary
@xmath is endowed with the orientation such that the orientation of the
boundary, together with the inward normal coincides with the orientation
of @xmath . Then, we assume that the oriented fibred solid torus @xmath
is constructed from the standard oriented trivial fibred solid torus
@xmath by performing a @xmath anticlockwise twist on the @xmath factor.
² ² 2 We remark that reversing the orientation of both factors @xmath
and @xmath provides an object which is orientation preservingly
isomorphic to @xmath . Now we call a fibre regular if it has a
neighbourhood isomorphic to a trivial fibred solid torus, critical
otherwise. Since a fibred solid torus has at most one critical fibre, it
turns out that the critical fibers are isolated.

#### 2.1.3 Topological construction of Seifert fibered manifolds

All Seifert manifolds can be constructed via the following procedure.
Let @xmath be the genus @xmath surface with @xmath boundary components
@xmath (with the convention that @xmath is positive if @xmath is
orientable and negative otherwise). Remove a collection of @xmath disks
@xmath from @xmath , thus obtaining a surface @xmath having @xmath
boundary components. Consider the (unique) orientable @xmath -bundle
over @xmath , which is isomorphic to @xmath or to @xmath , where the
product is twisted or not depending on @xmath being negative or not. In
this way we get a @xmath -manifold having @xmath toroidal boundary
components. Denote by @xmath the homotopy class of the fiber of this
@xmath -bundle — which we will refer to as the regular fiber — and call
@xmath the boundary loop of the disk @xmath for @xmath . Denote by
@xmath the boundary tori of @xmath fibering on the @xmath . We recall
that a slope on a torus @xmath is the isotopy class of an unoriented,
homotopically non trivial, simple closed curve. For every @xmath fix the
basis @xmath of @xmath ; then every slope can be written as @xmath for a
suitable pair of integer coefficients @xmath . Let @xmath be a @xmath
-manifold, and @xmath be a boundary torus. A Dehn filling of @xmath
along @xmath is the operation of gluing a solid torus @xmath to @xmath
via a diffeomorphism. We call @xmath the resulting manifold, which has a
boundary component less then @xmath .

###### Proposition 2.1 (10.1.2 , [Mar16]).

Let @xmath be a @xmath -manifold and @xmath be a boundary component.
Perform a Dehn filling along @xmath such that the meridian @xmath is
glued to some simple closed curve @xmath . Then the resulting manifold
@xmath only depends on the isotopy class of the unoriented curve @xmath
. We shall say that the Dehn filling kills the curve @xmath .

Proposition 2.1 implies that every pair of coprime integers @xmath
determines a Dehn filling killing the slope @xmath . Now for every
boundary torus @xmath , where @xmath we choose a pair of coprime
integers @xmath , and perform the Dehn filling along @xmath killing the
slope @xmath . Carrying out this construction, we obtain a Seiert
manifold having @xmath toroidal boundary components; we shall denote it
by @xmath . Calling @xmath the canonical generators of @xmath when
@xmath and @xmath the standard generators of @xmath when @xmath , with
in both cases @xmath being the loop representing the boundary
components, the computation of @xmath is straightforward by the Van
Kampen Theorem:

where we used the notation @xmath for the class of the regular fibre,
and @xmath in order to distinguish the classes @xmath in @xmath from the
corresponding projected classes in @xmath .

Given any Seifert fibration @xmath , its Euler number is @xmath , where
we take the sum @xmath when @xmath is not closed. Two Seifert manifolds
are isomorphic if there exists a fiber-preserving homeomorphism between
them. We recall two results on Seifert manifolds which classify them up
to isomorphism and homeomorphism.

###### Proposition 2.2 (Corollary 10.3.13 in [Mar16]).

Let @xmath and @xmath be two Seifert fibrations with @xmath . Then
@xmath and @xmath are isomorphic if and only if @xmath (up to
reordering), @xmath and @xmath , for all @xmath and, if the manifolds
are closed, @xmath .

Moreover, it turns out that every Seifert manifold admits a unique
Seifert fibration, but for few exceptional cases. Namely, the following
proposition holds (see [ Jac80 ] , Theorems VI.17 and VI.18 or
Propositions 10.4.16 and 10.4.17 in [ Mar16 ] ).

###### Proposition 2.3 (Classification of Seifert fibred manifolds up to
homeomorphism).

@xmath

1.   Every Seifert fibred manifold with non-empty boundary admits a
    unique Seifert fibration up to isomorphism, except in the following
    cases:

    -   @xmath , which admits the fibrations @xmath for any pair of
        coprime integers @xmath .

    -   @xmath , the twisted, orientable interval bundle over the Klein
        bottle, which admits two non-isomorphic Seifert fibrations:
        @xmath .

2.   Every closed Seifert fibred manifold @xmath which is not covered by
    @xmath or @xmath admits a single Seifert fibration up to
    isomorphism, except for @xmath , which admits the non-isomorphic
    fibrations: @xmath , @xmath .

#### 2.1.4 Seifert manifolds as @xmath-bundles over @xmath-orbifolds

We can think about a Seifert fibred manifold as a kind of surface
bundle, whose fibres are the circles of the foliation. In this view,
define @xmath as the quotient space of @xmath obtained by identifying
every circle of the foliation to a point, and call @xmath the projection
to the quotient. Let us focus on the local structure of this projection.
If @xmath is a trivial fibred solid torus, then @xmath is clearly a
@xmath -disc and the projection @xmath is a bundle projection. If @xmath
is a fibred solid torus @xmath , then @xmath is @xmath -covered by a
trivial fibred solid torus. The corresponding action of @xmath on @xmath
is generated by a homeomorphism which is the product of a rotation
through @xmath on the @xmath -factor with a rotation through @xmath on
the @xmath factor. This action of @xmath on @xmath induces an action of
@xmath on the base space @xmath , generated by a rotation through @xmath
. Hence in this particular case the space @xmath obtained by contracting
each fibre to a point can be identified with the quotient of the disc
@xmath by an action of @xmath by rotations, i.e. , an orbifold having
@xmath as underlying topological space and a conical singularity of
angle @xmath . We shall think about the projection map @xmath as a fibre
bundle whit orbifold base, in a generalized sense. Actually, this is a
bundle in the orbifold category, see [ Thu97 ] and [ BMP03 ] , §2.4. In
the general case, the quotient space @xmath of a Seifert fibred space
@xmath obtained identifying each fibre to a point is (topologically) a
surface, and is naturally equipped with an orbifold structure, in which
cone points correspond to the projections of the critical fibres.
Furthermore, if @xmath is a manifold with boundary then @xmath is an
orbifold with boundary, and @xmath is the preimage of @xmath under the
projection @xmath .

Thus, Seifert fibred manifolds can be viewed as true @xmath -bundles
over @xmath -dimensional orbifolds. In particular, orientable Seifert
manifolds can be viewed as @xmath -bundles over @xmath -orbifolds with
only conical singularities. We remark that in hte case where @xmath is a
surface then @xmath is a honest @xmath -bundle on @xmath , and the Euler
number of the Seifert fibration coincides with the Euler number of this
@xmath -bundle. Despite the fact that the definition via Dehn fillings
provides a deeper topological insight, this approach through orbifolds
is more informative about their geometry. Indeed, this perspective
originally due to Thurston has been used, for example, in [ Sco83 ] , [
Bon02 ] and [ Ohs87 ] to describe the complete, locally homogeneous
metrics admitted by Seifert manifolds. We shall explain how to switch
from the description by Dehn fillings to the description as fibration
over an orbifold, which will be useful for what follows. Let @xmath be a
Seifert fibered manifold. We can associate to @xmath its base orbifold
@xmath , which has @xmath as underlying topological surface, and has
@xmath conical points of order @xmath . In the case where the base
orbifold is compact, it is possible to define its orbifold Euler
characteristic , generalizing the idea of Euler characteristic for
surfaces.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath denotes the usual Euler characteristic of the surface
@xmath . The orbifold characteristic encodes many information, both
topological and geometric. First of all, since the Euler characteristic
is multiplicative with respect to finite coverings, it allows to
distinguish between orbifolds admitting a covering which is a manifold (
good orbifolds ) and those that do not admit any manifold covering which
is a manifold ( bad orbifolds ) ³ ³ 3 Here we are considering coverings
in the orbifold sense, see [ Thu97 ] . Bad orbifolds are completely
characterized: see [ Sco83 ] for a complete list. It turns out that
Seifert manifolds fibering on bad orbifolds are lens spaces , a
well-understood class of quotients of the @xmath -sphere. According to
Thurston [ Thu97 ] , Theorem 13.3.6, good orbifolds carry geometric
structures ( i.e. , they can be realized as quotients of @xmath or
@xmath by a discrete group of isometries acting possibly non freely),
and the type of the supported structure can be detected by computing the
orbifold characteristic. Namely, good orbifolds are distinguished in
hyperbolic, Euclidean and elliptic depending whether @xmath , @xmath or
@xmath (equivalently, if and only if they can be given a structure
modelled on @xmath , @xmath or @xmath respectively).

In this paper we will be mainly concerned with orbifolds appearing as
bases of orientable Seifert manifolds; moreover, we are mainly
interested in Seifert fibred manifolds with boundary, which obviously
fiber over @xmath -orbifolds with boundary. Two-dimensional orbifolds
with boundary are either disks with a unique singular point (and in this
case the Seifert fibration is a solid torus @xmath ), or are Euclidean
or hyperbolic orbifolds. Moreover, the only Euclidean orbifolds with
boundary are either the Möbius band @xmath without singular points, or
@xmath , the disk with two conical points of the same order @xmath , or
the cylinder. This can be summarized in the following:

###### Proposition 2.4.

The @xmath -dimensional orbifolds with boundary appearing as bases of
orientable Seifert manifolds are:

1.   The disk @xmath with a unique singular point of order @xmath ;

2.   The disk @xmath with two conical points of order @xmath , the
    Möbius band @xmath without singular points and the cylinder, of
    Euclidean type;

3.   All orbifolds @xmath of hyperbolic type.

Moreover, the only Seifert manifold which fibers over @xmath is the
solid torus, the only one fibering over @xmath and @xmath is @xmath and
over the cylinder is @xmath . Hence, all the Seifert manifolds with
boundary except @xmath , @xmath and @xmath fiber over hyperbolic
orbifolds.

#### 2.1.5 The short exact sequence

The structure of Seifert manifolds as @xmath -bundles over @xmath
-orbifolds gives the following exact sequence of groups (see [ Sco83 ] )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the subgroup generated by the regular fiber, the
injective morphism @xmath is induced by the immersion, @xmath is the
orbifold fundamental group , ( i.e. , the group of deck transformations
of the orbifold universal cover, see Appendix A ), and the surjective
morphism @xmath is induced on orbifolds groups by the projection @xmath
.

We recall the presentation of the orbifold fundamental group of a @xmath
-dimensional orbifold, where the loops @xmath are the standard
generators for the fundamental group of the underlying surface @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

if @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

if @xmath .

Let us consider @xmath , and let @xmath be the inclusion. Then the
elements @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath satisfy @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath . Hence, the short exact sequence gives us a more
significant information concerning the relation between @xmath and
@xmath . Indeed it provides a correspondence between the canonical
presentation of @xmath and the canonical presentation of @xmath .

### 2.2 The geometry of irreducible @xmath-manifolds

#### 2.2.1 The JSJ decomposition and the Hyperbolization Theorem

Every compact, orientable irreducible @xmath -manifold admits a
decomposition along suitable embedded tori. This decomposition is called
“ JSJ decomposition ” after the names of Jaco–Shalen and Johansson, who
obtained it independently in the late 1970s (see [ JS78 ] , [ Joh79 ] ).

Before stating the main results about this decomposition, we introduce
some notation; for full details, we refer the reader to [ Mar16 ] . Let
@xmath be a compact, orientable @xmath -manifold, and @xmath a properly
embedded orientable surface , i.e. an orientable, embedded surface such
that @xmath . A disk @xmath is called a compressing disc for @xmath if
@xmath and @xmath does not bound a disc in @xmath . A properly embedded,
connected, orientable surface @xmath with @xmath is compressible if it
has a compressing disc, incompressible otherwise, see Figure 2.2 .

A properly embedded surface @xmath is @xmath -parallel if the inclusion
@xmath is isotopic to a map into the boundary @xmath . A surface is
essential if it is incompressible and not @xmath -parallel.

In [ Thu82 ] Thurston introduced the following definition.

###### Definition 2.5.

An irreducible @xmath -manifold is homotopically atoroidal if every
@xmath -injective map from the torus to the irreducible manifold @xmath
is homotopic to a map into the boundary.

It turns out that homotopically atoroidal manifolds are, together with
Seifert manifolds, the “ building blocks ” of the closed, orientable,
irreducible @xmath -manifolds. This is made precise in the following
statement.

###### JSJ Decomposition Theorem.

Let @xmath be a closed, orientable, irreducible @xmath -manifold. There
exist a collection @xmath of disjoint, essential tori in the interior of
@xmath enjoing the following properties:

1.   [label=., ref=()]

2.   every connected component of @xmath is either a Seifert manifold,
    or homotopically atoroidal;

3.   the collection @xmath is minimal.

Furthermore, the collection @xmath is unique up to isotopy.

Notice that statement i. does not provide a dichotomy between Seifert
and homotopically atoroidal components of the decomposition. However, if
we focus on orientable Seifert fibred manifolds with boundary there are
only three manifolds which are both homotopically atoroidal and Seifert:
@xmath . Moreover, the only one that can possibly appear as a @xmath
component of a closed, orientable, irreducible @xmath -manifolds is
@xmath . ⁴ ⁴ 4 Notice that neither @xmath nor @xmath can appear as
@xmath component, (the first one by minimality of the collection, and
the second one because any torus abutting it would not be
incompressible).

In [ Thu82 ] , Thurston stated his celebrated Geometrization Conjecture
and announced some papers (see [ Thu86 ] , [ Thu98a ] , [ Thu98b ] )
proving his conjecture in restriction to Haken manifolds ⁵ ⁵ 5 A Haken
manifold is an irreducible @xmath -manifold containing a properly
embedded, incompressible, @xmath -sided surface. . One of the major
steps in the proof is the so called Hyperbolization Theorem, which
claims the existence of a complete Riemannian metric, locally isometric
to @xmath in the interior of non-Seifert fibered irreducible @xmath
-manifolds. We refer to [ Ota96 ] and [ Ota98 ] for a complete proof of
this theorem. Later on, thanks to the work of Perelman (see [ Per02 ] ,
[ Per03a ] and [ Per03b ] ), it was possible to replace the hypothesis
“Haken manifold” with “with infinite fundamental group” in the statement
of the Hyperbolization Theorem. We state here the more recent version of
the Thoerem:

###### Hyperbolization Theorem.

The interior of a compact, orientable, irreducible, @xmath -manifold
@xmath with infinite fundamental group admits a complete, hyperbolic
metric if and only if the manifold is homotopically atoroidal and not
homeomorphic to @xmath . Moreover, the hyperbolic metric has finite
volume if and only if @xmath is a union of tori and @xmath .

### 2.3 Non-positively curved @xmath metrics on Seifert manifolds

We observed in Chapter 2 that Seifert components of irreducible,
orientable, closed @xmath -manifolds having at leat a hyperbolic piece
in their @xmath decomposition are either of hyperbolic type or
homeomorphic to @xmath , as @xmath and @xmath cannot appear as @xmath
components of closed, irreducible @xmath -manifolds. In §
LABEL:section_Eberlein we explained how a non-positively curved metric
with totally geodesic boundary @xmath on a Seifert fibred manifold
@xmath with base orbifold @xmath provides us with a non-positively
curved metric with totally geodesic boundary @xmath on the base
orbifold. Moreover, the quotient map collapsing the fibres to points is
a Riemannian orbifold submersion @xmath . This section is devoted to the
proof of the following proposition:

###### Proposition 2.6.

For every orientable Seifert manifold with boundary and hyperbolic base
orbifold @xmath , given any compatible collection of metrics @xmath on
the boundary tori @xmath of @xmath , there exist @xmath with @xmath as
@xmath and a @xmath -parameter family of @xmath Riemannian metrics
@xmath , such that:

-   @xmath , where @xmath is the sectional curvature of the metric
    @xmath ;

-   @xmath ;

-    the metrics are flat in a collar of the boundary;

-   @xmath .

Any compatible metric @xmath on @xmath is the restriction to the
boundary of a flat metric @xmath . Then the collection @xmath for @xmath
is a continuous family of homothetic flat metrics verifying in
particular @xmath — @xmath .

###### Remark 2.7.

Few words about this result:

-   with these requirements we are not able to extend any compatible
    collection of flat metrics on @xmath , but any compatible collection
    has a rescaling which can be extended to a @xmath Riemannian metric
    as above;

-   in the case where @xmath is a Seifert fibred manifold with
    hyperbolic base orbifold the bounds on @xmath are “ @xmath -almost
    optimal" in the sense that the upper bound coincides with the upper
    bound of a geometric metric of finite volume on @xmath and the lower
    bound is smaller than the lower bound of such a metric by an amount
    of @xmath ;

-   the almost optimal lower bound on the sectional curvature, turns out
    to be a strong constraint: indeed, it is possible to put smooth,
    non-positively curved Riemannian metric satisfying conditions @xmath
    — @xmath up to relaxing the condition @xmath to @xmath for a
    suitable @xmath , but we are not able to find a smooth family of
    metrics satisfying the bounds in @xmath ;

-   if we ask a @xmath -almost optimal upper bound on the sectional
    curvature, instead of non-positivity, that is @xmath , we can
    improve @xmath to @xmath , using a density argument.

###### Proof.

First of all, we shall treat separately the case where @xmath is a
hyperbolic orbifold and the case of @xmath .

Case @xmath . Let @xmath be a collection of compatible metrics on @xmath
. By definition, there exists on @xmath a metric @xmath of non-positive
curvature such that @xmath is isometric to @xmath . As we have seen in
Section § LABEL:section_Eberlein this gives us a non-positively curved
metric @xmath on the base orbifold @xmath and a Riemannian orbifold
submersion @xmath . Equivalently, we have a pair of morphisms @xmath and
@xmath such that the pair @xmath is an injective morphism of @xmath into
@xmath , whose action on @xmath is free and discrete. We recall that, by
construction, we have :

— if @xmath , then @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath are orientation
preserving isometries of @xmath —thus translations of @xmath —, then
Leeb’s compatibility condition can be expressed in additive notation
(with a slight abuse of notation, since we are identifying the
translation thought as an isometry with the amount of the translation
itself):

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

— if @xmath we know that the generators @xmath of @xmath act on each of
the two factors of the Riemannian product @xmath as orientation
reversing isometries, this means that @xmath , @xmath are inversions of
@xmath . Consequently @xmath for any @xmath . As the @xmath ’s and the
@xmath ’s act as orientation preserving isometries on both factors we
conclude that, also in this case, we can use the additive notation to
express the compatibility conditions:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Observe that, if @xmath is an injective morphism whose image acts freely
and discretely on @xmath , the same holds for @xmath , where we denoted
@xmath the morphism which coincides with @xmath on the generators @xmath
’s, @xmath ’s if @xmath and @xmath ’s if @xmath and which is a rescaling
by a factor @xmath of the translations @xmath ’s, @xmath ’s and @xmath .
For any @xmath we shall denote by @xmath the translation length of
@xmath , that is, the length of the corresponding boundary component of
@xmath . Notice that the translation length of @xmath is equal to @xmath
and it is attained for all the points of one boundary component of
@xmath which is one of the lifts of the boundary torus @xmath .

Now we shall modify a geometric metric @xmath on @xmath locally
isometric to @xmath in order to obtain the desired collection of @xmath
metrics @xmath whose curvatures are bounded by @xmath , with @xmath ,
flat near the boundary, such that the restriction @xmath , where @xmath
with @xmath for @xmath , and whose volumes collapse as @xmath . Once
chosen @xmath a complete geometric metric of finite volume on @xmath ,
locally isometric to @xmath , call @xmath the corresponding complete
hyperbolic metric on @xmath , and @xmath the injective morphism such
that @xmath is isometric to @xmath .
Let us denote by @xmath the connected components of a horoball
neighbourhood of the cusps in @xmath ; observe that by definition it
does not contain any conical point (see Appendix A ). Fix the
parametrization in horospherical coordinates; then @xmath . Let @xmath
be the length of the section @xmath with respect to the hyperbolic
metric. Then the hyperbolic metric on each cusp @xmath can be locally
written as a warped product:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is an Euclidean metric on the horosphere.

Now, let @xmath . We shall modify the hyperbolic metric on the cusps
starting from time @xmath , thus producing the required sequence. Before
that, let us state the following proposition whose proof is given in
Appendix B .

###### Proposition 2.8.

For every fixed @xmath there exist @xmath arbitrarily small and @xmath
such that:

1.  @xmath is not increasing and convex, such that

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    where

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

2.  @xmath for every @xmath ;

3.  @xmath for every @xmath .

where @xmath .

Now, let @xmath be the @xmath function on @xmath which coincides with
@xmath for @xmath and with @xmath given by Proposition 2.8 for @xmath
for @xmath . Then, substitute the warping function @xmath on @xmath with
the new function @xmath , thus obtaining the metric

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For any fixed @xmath this gives us a @xmath Riemannian metric @xmath
satisfying the required bounds on the sectional curvature, which is
hyperbolic on the complement of the horoball neighbourhoods @xmath and
flat near the boundary. Nevertheless, condition @xmath is not verified,
hence, we shall adjust the metric @xmath along the cusps, and we shall
give an explicit value of @xmath of point @xmath . Let us remark that
@xmath of Proposition 2.8 continuously depends on @xmath , and goes to
@xmath as @xmath . In particular, for every

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

we can find a suitable @xmath -tuple @xmath so that for every cusp we
have @xmath . Let us call @xmath the previous metric and let us denote
by @xmath the corresponding injective homomorphism. It is worth to
notice that, integrating along the cusps, we get

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

when @xmath .
To conclude, consider @xmath and observe that the induced Riemannian
metric @xmath clearly verifies conditions @xmath — @xmath , while
condition @xmath follows from:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Case @xmath . Now suppose that @xmath . Then the Seifert manifold @xmath
is @xmath , and can be viewed as @xmath , having the Möbius band as base
orbifold (surface) and no singular points. We write down presentations
for the (orbifold) fundamental groups:

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Observe that a flat metric on the boundary torus of @xmath is compatible
if and only if is the restriction to the boundary of a flat metric
@xmath on @xmath . Indeed, a non-flat, non positively curved metric
@xmath on @xmath flat on a collar of the boundary would give a
non-positively curved metric on @xmath , the Riemannian manifold
obtained by doubling @xmath along the boundary torus. But @xmath is
finitely covered by a @xmath -dimensional torus @xmath , and this would
give a contradiction since @xmath , the lift of the metric @xmath would
be a non-positively curved, non-flat metric on @xmath . The flat metric
@xmath on @xmath is obtained as the quotient of @xmath (for a suitable
choice of @xmath ) by the isometry subgroup given by the image of the
following injective homomorphism:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the glide-reflection @xmath , for @xmath and @xmath is a
the symmetry with respect to a point in @xmath . As usual @xmath acts as
the identity on the first component @xmath and as a translation @xmath
on @xmath . Observe that the isometries @xmath and @xmath act fixing
both boundary components of @xmath and that @xmath with @xmath . In
other words, given the previous presentation of @xmath the elements
@xmath and @xmath act as translations along orthogonal directions on the
universal covering: hence a compatible metric @xmath on @xmath is
necessarily a flat metric generated by an orthogonal lattice (given by
restricting @xmath to an isometry of @xmath ). Rescalings of @xmath
provides @xmath with the required family of Riemannian metrics. ∎

### 2.4 Metrics of non-positive curvature on atoroidal @xmath-manifolds

The main result of this section is the following:

###### Theorem 2.9.

Let @xmath be a hyperbolic component and let @xmath be a flat metric on
the boundary of @xmath . There exists a sequence of metrics @xmath on
@xmath such that:

1.   For every @xmath the sectional curvature @xmath is pinched:

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

2.  @xmath , where @xmath it the unique —up to isometry— complete,
    finite volume hyperbolic metric on @xmath .

3.   There exists a family @xmath of nested horoball neighbourhoods of
    the cusps of @xmath , whose complements for @xmath progressively
    exhaust @xmath , such that @xmath is isometric to an open set @xmath
    in @xmath and such that @xmath .

4.   The metric @xmath is flat in a collar of the boundary and there
    exists @xmath such that @xmath is isometric to @xmath .

In order to achieve this result we will prove a the following lemma,
which is a refinement of part of the argument given by Leeb to prove [
Lee95 ] , Proposition 2.3.

###### Lemma 2.10.

Let @xmath be an open @xmath -manifold endowed with a complete
Riemannian metric of finite volume, locally isometric to @xmath . Let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

be a horoball neighbourhood of the cusps of @xmath . Let @xmath be a
collection of flat metrics on @xmath . There exists a @xmath -parameter
family of complete Riemannian metrics @xmath with the following
properties:

1.  @xmath ;

2.  @xmath on @xmath , where @xmath , for @xmath and where the constant
    @xmath is determined by @xmath , @xmath and @xmath ;

3.  @xmath in @xmath where @xmath ;

4.   for @xmath the Riemannian manifold @xmath is isometric to @xmath
    where @xmath is determined by @xmath , by the collection @xmath and
    the choice of @xmath ;

5.  @xmath .

###### Proof.

Let us start with a complete hyperbolic metric of finite volume @xmath
on @xmath . Let @xmath be the horoball neighbourhood of the cusps of
@xmath defined in the statement. We know that @xmath is given in
horospherical coordinates on @xmath by:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is determined up to rescaling solely by the metric @xmath
on @xmath , which by Mostow’s rigidity theorem is unique, and is thus
independent of the choice of the horoball neighbourhood of the cusps
@xmath .
Now we shall change the warping function describing the hyperbolic
metric on @xmath following Leeb’s argument. Let us consider the flat
metrics @xmath , @xmath on @xmath ; by the Spectral Theorem it is
possible to find a coordinate system @xmath for @xmath such that @xmath
and @xmath where @xmath are two positive real constants. Up to rescaling
the metrics @xmath by the constant @xmath we have @xmath for every
@xmath .

Let @xmath be the following function

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now we define the following functions, which will be the new warping
functions for the metric along the cusps:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath will be suitably chosen later on. Then consider the
following metrics on the @xmath ’s:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Notice that the metrics @xmath coincide with @xmath on @xmath and are
equal to @xmath on @xmath . Now we shall compute the sectional curvature
of the metric @xmath obtained by gluing in the obvious way the metrics
@xmath along the cusps. By construction the sectional curvature is
constantly equal to @xmath except on the portions @xmath of the cusps.
Hence we will need to compute the sectional curvature of the metrics
@xmath only in restriction to @xmath . An explicit computation of the
Christoffel’s symbols for @xmath gives:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

and zero for all the remaining Christoffel symbols. Thus the sectional
curvatures of @xmath are given by the following formulas:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Let us compute the derivatives of @xmath up to the second order (those
of @xmath are analogous):

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

Notice that @xmath , @xmath . We shall now give conditions on @xmath
which ensure that @xmath are between @xmath and @xmath .

Let us start with the curvature @xmath . We want to give conditions on
@xmath so that:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The second inequality is equivalent to:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath , @xmath are evaluated at @xmath . We notice that, since
@xmath is non-increasing, the previous ratio is always greater then or
equal to @xmath , independently on the choice of @xmath . Thus
inequality @xmath actually holds. Now we shall deal with the first
inequality @xmath . Remark that:

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

Moreover, an easy calculation shows that condition

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

ensures that @xmath for every @xmath .

Now we shall prescribe the bounds on @xmath , to derive the conditions
on @xmath . We ask:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The first inequality is equivalent to:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath are computed in @xmath . Denote by @xmath ; then a
straightforward computation shows that inequality @xmath holds provided
that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For the second inequality, notice that, since @xmath on @xmath and
@xmath we only need to look at the ratio defining @xmath on @xmath . Let
us denote by @xmath then, it is sufficient to choose @xmath such that:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, the sectional curvature @xmath is pinched as required provided
that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Analogously, the condition

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

ensures that inequalities @xmath hold.

It follows by the discussion about curvatures that, for @xmath ,
choosing

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the constant @xmath only depends on @xmath , @xmath and on the
choice of the original horoball neighbourhood @xmath , the sectional
curvatures are pinched as required in the statement. From now on we
shall consider @xmath . With this proviso, the metric @xmath verifies
properties @xmath — @xmath .

Finally, we have to check Property @xmath , concerning the convergence
of the volumes. Let us denote by @xmath the volume of @xmath , by @xmath
the sum of the volumes respect of the warped toroidal cylinders @xmath
and by @xmath the sum of the volumes of @xmath . With this notation:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By construction @xmath . For any @xmath and any @xmath we denote by
@xmath the area of @xmath with respect to the restriction of the metric
@xmath . Then:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now observe that for @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We define:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Finally, we give an estimate for @xmath . Let @xmath , then:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since for @xmath we have @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , we conclude:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

∎

###### Proof of Theorem 2.9.

Let @xmath be a compact, irreducible, orientable, @xmath -manifold with
non-empty toroidal boundary @xmath , whose interior @xmath admits a
complete hyperbolic metric @xmath of finite volume. Fix a horoball
neighbourhood @xmath of the cusps of @xmath (as in the statement of
Lemma 2.10 ). Hence, Lemma 2.10 provides us with a continuous @xmath
-parameter family of complete Riemannian metrics @xmath , satisfying
@xmath — @xmath . Let the horoball neighbourhood @xmath be parametrized
as:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then, the metrics @xmath in restriction to @xmath can be written as
@xmath . We shall now apply Proposition 2.8 for @xmath and @xmath :
there exists a @xmath function @xmath (where @xmath are sufficiently
small positive constants) such that

1.  @xmath is not increasing and convex;

2.  @xmath verifies

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    where: @xmath .

3.  @xmath for every @xmath ;

4.  @xmath for every @xmath .

where @xmath . Now, let @xmath for @xmath and @xmath for @xmath . Then
glue the Riemannian metric @xmath in restriction to @xmath to the
Riemannian @xmath metric given by @xmath on @xmath ; remark that both
metrics on @xmath have the form @xmath by construction. The result of
these gluings for any @xmath produces a @xmath Riemmanian metric @xmath
on @xmath satisfying properties @xmath — @xmath . Properties @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath are straightforward from the construction; to check
property @xmath one needs to adapt the argument for the volume
convergence from Proposition 2.6 and use it in combination with Lemma
2.10 , @xmath . ∎

### 2.5 An upper bound to MinEnt

In this last section of Chapter 3 we shall give a proof of Theorem
LABEL:thm_construction_sequence_on_irreducible_Y , thus exhibiting a
sequence of @xmath Riemannian metrics of non-positive sectional
curvatures converging to the conjectural value of the Minimal Entropy of
@xmath .

###### Proof of Theorem
LABEL:thm_construction_sequence_on_irreducible_Y.

Since @xmath is a closed irreducible, orientable @xmath -manifold, with
non-trivial @xmath decomposition and at least one hyperbolic @xmath
-component, we know that there exists a @xmath compatible collection of
flat metrics @xmath on the boundary components @xmath ’s of the @xmath
components of @xmath . By Proposition 2.6 and Theorem 2.9 we know that
for any choice of @xmath there exists a suitable @xmath depending on
@xmath and the @xmath compatible collection @xmath such that:

-   on every hyperbolic @xmath component @xmath , @xmath of @xmath there
    exists a metric @xmath verifying @xmath – @xmath and @xmath for the
    constant @xmath ;

-   on every Seifert fibred @xmath component @xmath , @xmath of @xmath
    there exists a metric @xmath satisfying properties @xmath — @xmath ;

By construction and @xmath compatibility of the @xmath collection these
metrics on the @xmath components fit together to produce a
non-positively curved @xmath Riemannian metric @xmath on @xmath with the
following properties:

1.  @xmath ;

2.  @xmath so that, by what has been proved in Proposition 2.6 and
    Theorem LABEL:thm_leeb_ator we have:

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

Using Bishop-Gunther Theorem we get from (1) that @xmath , hence for any
@xmath we can find a sufficiently small @xmath such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This implies the estimate:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

. ∎

## Chapter 3 Bounding MinEnt from above: reducible @xmath-manifolds

In this Chapter, we shall provide the ( a posteriori ) optimal estimate
from above for the Minimal Entropy in the case where @xmath is a closed,
orientable, reducible @xmath -manifold. Namely, we shall prove the
following statement.

###### Theorem 3.1.

Let @xmath be a closed, orientable, reducible @xmath -manifold, and
suppose that @xmath is the decomposition of @xmath in prime summands.
For every @xmath , denote by @xmath the hyperbolic @xmath components of
@xmath , and by @xmath the corresponding complete, finite volume metric
on @xmath . Then:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The proof of such an estimate relies on the existence of sequences of
metrics converging to the Minimal Entropy on the single prime summands.
Indeed, also in this case we shall construct explicitly a family of
metrics whose volume-entropies are smaller than any constant strictly
greater than the previous upper bound.

###### Remark 3.2.

It is worth to stress that Theorem 3.1 will be presented as a
consequence of a more general statement concerning the Minimal Entropy
of connected sums of closed, orientable, @xmath -dimensional manifolds
(for @xmath ), see Theorem 3.3 .

Let us briefly introduce the Poincaré series which will be the key tool
to achieve this result.

### 3.1 Entropy and the Poincaré series

It is well known that, given any Riemannian manifold @xmath with
Riemannian distance @xmath , its entropy can be characterized as:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the usual pull-back metric on the universal cover.

Let us fix any base point @xmath for the fundamental group of @xmath .
The Poincaré series of @xmath computed at @xmath is :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It is straightforward that the abscisse of convergence of @xmath
coincides with the abscisse of convergence of @xmath , also known as
critical exponent of @xmath . Indeed, let @xmath denote a fixed
fundamental domain for the action of @xmath on @xmath . Then,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and if we denote by @xmath , the following inequalities hold:

  -- -------- -------- --
              @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

This shows that the integral converges at @xmath if and only if @xmath .

### 3.2 A Riemannian metric on the connected sum

Let @xmath , @xmath be two closed, oriented, connected Riemannian @xmath
-manifolds for @xmath . We shall now construct a family of metrics on
@xmath . Let us assume to have fixed @xmath , @xmath and two positive
real numbers @xmath with @xmath . Excide the geodesic balls of radius
@xmath around @xmath , @xmath and glue the Riemannian tube @xmath to
@xmath where @xmath is defined as follows. Let @xmath be a smooth
function which is identically equal to @xmath on an @xmath
-neighbourhood of @xmath , identically equal to zero on @xmath , which
is non-increasing on @xmath and non-decreasing on @xmath . Then, let us
denote by @xmath and @xmath the restrictions of @xmath and @xmath
respectively to @xmath and @xmath (the spheres of radius @xmath centered
at @xmath , @xmath respectively). We shall define @xmath as follows: <
where we denoted by @xmath the characteristic function of the interval
@xmath (see Figure 3.1 ). In the sequel we shall assume to have chosen
@xmath such that @xmath or equivalently that @xmath . We shall denote by
@xmath the Riemannian manifold which is the result of the gluing, see
Figure 3.2 .

The main result of the next two sections is the following theorem:

###### Theorem 3.3.

Let @xmath and @xmath be two Riemannian manifolds. Let @xmath be two
positive real constants and @xmath be the Riemannian manifold
constructed as above. There exists a constant @xmath depending on @xmath
, @xmath such that for any @xmath the following holds:

-    the critical exponent of the series @xmath is smaller than or equal
    to @xmath .

Moreover, chosen @xmath , for every @xmath there exists an @xmath such
that for every @xmath :

-   @xmath .

As a consequence, we have the following estimate which is valid for any
dimension @xmath :

###### Corollary 3.4.

Let @xmath , @xmath be two closed, orientable, differentiable @xmath
-manifolds for @xmath . Then:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath denotes the connected sum of @xmath , @xmath .

###### Proof.

Let @xmath and @xmath two sequences of metrics converging to the Minimal
Entropy of @xmath and @xmath respectively. Up to normalization, we can
assume that @xmath ; this does not affect the minimality of the
sequence. The proof is a straightforward application of Theorem 3.3 to
these two sequences of metrics on @xmath , @xmath minimizing the
invariant @xmath . ∎

### 3.3 The proof of Theorem 3.3

Before proving Theorem 3.3 , we shall fix some notation. Denote by
@xmath the Riemannian distance associated to @xmath . Recall that for
any @xmath the value @xmath does not depend on the lift chosen for
@xmath . From now on we shall denote by @xmath the length, with respect
to the metric @xmath of the shortest geodesic loop representing @xmath .
Namely, @xmath , where @xmath is any lift of @xmath . Similarly, for any
choice of @xmath , @xmath we define @xmath and @xmath the function
mapping any class in @xmath , @xmath into the length of the shortest
geodesic representative with respect to @xmath , @xmath .

Let @xmath be a point contained in the set @xmath and @xmath be the
centers of the balls removed from @xmath respectively when constructing
the metric @xmath . We shall denote by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

the isomorphism obtained in two steps:

1.  Let @xmath be the metric space obtained as the junction of @xmath
    and @xmath via an interval @xmath (with the standard metric) joining
    @xmath to @xmath . Let @xmath be the map obtained by collapsing the
    tube @xmath to the interval @xmath , sending @xmath onto @xmath ,
    via the map @xmath and @xmath onto @xmath via a similar map. Finally
    @xmath is sent identically onto itself (and similarly @xmath ).

2.  Call @xmath the point @xmath . By construction we know that @xmath
    is an isomorphism. On the other hand it is obviously true that
    @xmath is isomorphic to @xmath , where the isomorphism is given by
    the following map: fix @xmath and @xmath the unique unit speed
    geodesics in @xmath joining @xmath to @xmath and @xmath
    respectively. Then, the isomorphism is given by:

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    for any @xmath .

Hence we define @xmath , and @xmath and @xmath the monomorphisms
obtained restricting @xmath , which embed @xmath and @xmath into @xmath
. Moreover, we denote by @xmath and @xmath .
By definition of @xmath every @xmath can be (uniquely) written as:
@xmath , where @xmath and @xmath are possibly equal to the identity,
@xmath for @xmath and @xmath for @xmath . Notice that we are making a
little abuse of notation since we are omitting the identification of the
elements of @xmath and @xmath with the elements of @xmath which
correspond via the isomorphisms @xmath , @xmath .

###### Lemma 3.5.

With the above notation, assume @xmath . For any element @xmath let
@xmath be a reduced syllabic form for @xmath . Then:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

First of all we observe that by construction of the metric the sets
@xmath where @xmath are totally geodesic hypersurfaces (because the
metric is a Riemannian product). Moreover the set @xmath for @xmath is
such that every minimizing geodesic @xmath joining pair of points @xmath
, @xmath is entirely contained in @xmath . Indeed, any curve @xmath
joining the two points and contained in the tube @xmath has length
greater than or equal to the length of its projection on @xmath with
equality holding only for those curves contained into @xmath , because
the metric in the tube is a Riemannian product. Furthermore, since
@xmath , every curve joining @xmath and @xmath and escaping the tube
@xmath has length greater than @xmath , which is equal to the diameter
of @xmath . Let @xmath be a shortest representative in the homotopy
class of @xmath . Denote by @xmath the connected subsegments of @xmath
entirely contained in one of the two sides separated by @xmath . Observe
that:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

Indeed, for any @xmath and any @xmath consider two minimizing geodesics
@xmath , @xmath contained in @xmath and connecting @xmath respectively
to @xmath and to @xmath and call @xmath ( @xmath respectively) the path
obtained by joining @xmath to the @xmath -geodesic connecting @xmath to
@xmath . By construction the loop @xmath is homotopic to the join of the
loops @xmath ’s and @xmath ’s following the order in which the @xmath
’s, @xmath ’s appear along @xmath . Notice that by construction the
@xmath ’s and the @xmath ’s appear alternately. Let @xmath be the map
defined before and let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

be the inverse of the isomorphism constructed before the Lemma. Then,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Otherwise, if @xmath were not trivial, we could replace @xmath with a
minimizing geodesic @xmath (contained in @xmath ) connecting the two
endpoints of @xmath , thus obtaining a shortest representative of @xmath
, thus contradicting the minimality of @xmath .
As a consequence @xmath and @xmath . Moreover, by the previous
discussion:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By the unicity of the reduced form of an element in a free product we
deduce that: @xmath , @xmath for every @xmath .
Recall that our goal is to provide a sufficiently accurate estimate from
below to the length of the shortest representative @xmath of @xmath with
respect to the Riemannian metric @xmath in terms of @xmath and of the
lengths of the shortest representatives (with respect to the metrics
@xmath , @xmath ) of the elements @xmath ’s, @xmath ’s of @xmath and
@xmath for every @xmath .

Claim (0). Any @xmath (respectively @xmath ) is such that @xmath for any
@xmath (respectively, @xmath for any @xmath ).

Proof of Claim (0). Straightforward from the definition of the metric. ∎

Claim (1). Any @xmath (respectively @xmath ) is such that @xmath for any
@xmath (respectively, @xmath for any @xmath ).

Proof of Claim (1). Let us observe first that @xmath for every @xmath .
Otherwise the loop @xmath would be trivial, which is not. On the other
hand assume that @xmath crosses a sphere @xmath , with @xmath , for at
least three times. Then, we would have that @xmath . Now, let @xmath and
@xmath be respectively the first time in which @xmath crosses @xmath in
direction @xmath and the last time in which @xmath crosses @xmath in
direction @xmath . Connect @xmath with @xmath with a geodesic segment in
@xmath , call it @xmath . Then the path @xmath is homotopic with fixed
ends to @xmath , and is shorter. This is a contradiction because
substituting @xmath with this new path would produce a shorter
representative for @xmath .∎

We shall now look at the path @xmath outside the tube @xmath
(respectively, @xmath ). Let @xmath ,…, @xmath be the subpaths of @xmath
contained in @xmath . Now, look at @xmath in restriction to @xmath and
observe that it is a loop based at @xmath . Moreover, its homotopy class
@xmath . Now, let @xmath . The following hold:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where we denoted by @xmath the quotient metric of @xmath where @xmath if
and only if @xmath ; and where we introduced the notation @xmath for the
@xmath -geodesic segment joining @xmath to the other endpoint @xmath
(see Figure 3.3 ).

Since we are in balls of radius shorter than the injectivity radius of
@xmath , @xmath is homotopic with fixed endpoints to @xmath . On the
other hand, observe that @xmath in restriction to @xmath is an isometry
on its image. Hence, the path obtained from @xmath replacing the @xmath
with the @xmath is a representative of the same homotopy class and its
length is less than the length of @xmath . We deduce the following
inequality:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which is the desired estimate. ∎

Now we can prove Theorem 3.3

###### Proof of Theorem 3.3.

Let @xmath , where @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , with possibly
@xmath , @xmath . Then, by Lemma 3.5 we have:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus we get:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

So the Poincaré series of @xmath with respect to the metric @xmath can
be estimated as follows:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the second inequality is consequence of a rearrangement of the
summands, the third follows from Lemma 3.5 and the last follows from the
definition of the Poincaré series, with @xmath denoting the Poincaré
series without the summand corresponding to the identity.
Now for any arbitrarily chosen

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

the series @xmath and @xmath converge to @xmath , @xmath . Thus the
problem of the convergence of @xmath is reduced to the convergence of
the geometric series:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This series converges if the length @xmath of the interpolation cylinder
is large enough:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

As @xmath this shows that the critical exponent of @xmath is less or
equal to @xmath for @xmath sufficiently large. This concludes the proof
of Theorem 3.3 (1).

Let us now focus on assertion (2), i.e. the convergence of the volume.
By construction of the metric @xmath we have:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

but also:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now observe that in restriction to @xmath the metric @xmath is equal to
the metric @xmath described in Chapter 4, § 3.2 . Moreover, denoting:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we observe that these are finite quantities. Call @xmath ; then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath . Hence, for every fixed @xmath and every @xmath there
exists @xmath such that for every @xmath we have:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which proves part (2). ∎

### 3.4 Proof of Theorem 3.1

Before going into the proof of Theorem 3.1 we recall some facts:

1.  Let @xmath be a closed, orientable Seifert fibred manifold or a
    graph-manifold, then we have @xmath by [ AP03 ] .

2.  Let @xmath be a closed, orientable manifold which admits a
    hyperbolic metric. Then by [ BCG95 ] we know that the hyperbolic
    metric realizes the Minimal Entropy, that is @xmath .

3.  Finally from Theorem
    LABEL:thm_construction_sequence_on_irreducible_Y we know that on
    every irreducible, closed, orientable @xmath -manifold with
    non-trivial @xmath decomposition and at least one hyperbolic @xmath
    component we have

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    i.e. , @xmath is additive with respect to the connected sum.

###### Proof of Theorem 3.1.

The theorem follows by iteratively applying Corollary 3.4 to the prime
summands of the manifold @xmath , keeping into account the estimates
(1)—(3) existing for the Minimal Entropy of the prime summands. ∎

## Chapter 4 The lower bound via the barycentre method: irreducible
@xmath-manifolds

In this Chapter we shall find the optimal lower bound for the Minimal
Entropy of a closed, orientable, irreducible @xmath -manifold @xmath .
We shall handle the reducible case in Chapter 6.

Let @xmath be a closed, orientable, irreducible @xmath -manifold,
consider its @xmath decomposition and denote by @xmath the hyperbolic
@xmath components. For every @xmath the manifold @xmath can be endowed
with a complete hyperbolic, finite volume metric, unique up to
isometries by Mostow Rigidity Theorem; we shall denote it by @xmath .

The main result of this section is the following.

###### Theorem 4.1.

Let @xmath be a closed, orientable, irreducible @xmath -manifold, and
let @xmath be its hyperbolic @xmath components. Then, the following
inequality holds:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The last statement, together with Theorem
LABEL:thm_construction_sequence_on_irreducible_Y gives the exact
computation of the minimal entropy in the irreducible case. In order to
prove this inequality, we shall use the barycenter method applied to a
@xmath -parameter family of @xmath Riemannian metrics @xmath on @xmath ,
which are non-positively curved and locally isometric to @xmath on
larger and larger open subsets (as @xmath ), constructed in Chapter
LABEL:section_a_conjectural_minimizing_sequence_irreducible .

### 4.1 The barycentre method

In this section we shall give a brief introduction to the barycenter
method . Roughly speaking, given a map @xmath which lifts to a @xmath
-equivariant map @xmath between the universal covers —here @xmath is the
homomorphism induced by @xmath between the first homotopy groups—, the
method consists in:

-   Immersing @xmath in @xmath —the space of positive and finite Borel
    measures on @xmath — via a family of @xmath -equivariant maps @xmath
    .

-   Taking @xmath , the push-forward measure with respect to @xmath .

-   Projecting from @xmath on @xmath by composing with the map which
    associates to any measure in @xmath its barycenter, that we are
    going to describe in detail in few lines.

This way, we shall obtain, via the composition of the three maps
described above, a family of maps @xmath —namely, @xmath :

[]

By construction, the maps @xmath have the following properties:

-   @xmath is @xmath -equivariant, i.e. @xmath ; hence, every @xmath
    induces a quotient map @xmath such that @xmath ;

-   the induced maps @xmath are homotopic to the map @xmath for every
    @xmath ;

In our context, we shall consider the following family of immersions in
the space @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the Riemannian measure of the metric @xmath on @xmath
and @xmath . All these measures are finite by the integral
characterization of the entropy in the compact case, see Section 3.1 .

Now we shall give the formal definition of the barycentre of a measure
@xmath on a complete, simply connected Riemannian manifold having
non-positive curvature. For the proof of the good definition of the
barycenter, and of the useful properties provided in Lemmata 4.4 , 4.6 ,
4.7 we refer to [ Sam99 ] .

###### Definition 4.2.

Let @xmath be a complete simply connected Riemannian manifold with
non-positive curvature, and @xmath a positive, finite Borel measure on
it. If there exists at least a point @xmath such that the integral
@xmath converges, then the so-called Leibniz function :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is well defined for any @xmath —namely, the integral converges for any
@xmath —, is positive and is @xmath .

As a consequence of the strict convexity of the Riemannian distance
function @xmath on @xmath , it follows that the Leibniz function
associated to any @xmath is a strictly convex function. Moreover, for
any fixed @xmath we have that @xmath as @xmath . We refer to [ Sam99 ]
for these facts. As a consequence, it follows that @xmath admits a
unique critical point. It makes thus sense to give the following
definition.

###### Definition 4.3.

Let @xmath and @xmath as above. We define the barycentre of @xmath as
the unique critical point of the associated Leibniz function. In
particular, in this setting the critical point is a minimum. It will be
denoted @xmath . The barycenter is equivariant , i.e. , for every @xmath
we have @xmath .

We shall now list some properties verified by the maps @xmath , @xmath .
These properties are classical (see for example [ Sam99 ] ),
nevertheless we shall provide proofs for the sake of completeness.

###### Lemma 4.4 (Equivariance of @xmath).

Using the notation introduced above, the maps @xmath are @xmath
-equivariant, and thus induce maps between the quotients @xmath .

###### Proof.

We recall that @xmath is the homomorphism induced by @xmath . We need to
prove that the @xmath are @xmath -equivariant, i.e. , @xmath for any
@xmath . This will follow from:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Indeed, the following equalities hold:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Hence, the minimum of @xmath is equal to the image via @xmath of the
minimum of @xmath . ∎

###### Lemma 4.5.

The maps @xmath are homotopic to @xmath .

###### Proof.

Since @xmath is non-positively curved we know that @xmath is an
aspherical space. Hence, the set of homotopy classes of maps @xmath from
@xmath to @xmath is in bijection with @xmath . As a consequence of this
bijection, and of the fact that @xmath we deduce that @xmath is
homotopic to @xmath . ∎

By taking derivatives of the Leibniz function it is easily seen that for
every complete, simply connected, non-positively curved @xmath and every
positive, finite Borel measure @xmath on @xmath the barycenter @xmath is
uniquely determined by the implicit equation: @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath . As a consequence, we have the following implicit
equations for the maps @xmath (see [ Sam99 ] or [ Sam98 ] for a detailed
proof of the following Lemmata 4.6 , 4.7 and 4.8 ):

###### Lemma 4.6 (Implicit equations for @xmath).

The functions @xmath are univocally determined by the vectorial implicit
equations @xmath , where @xmath is defined as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is a @xmath -orthonormal basis for the tangent space @xmath
, and @xmath .

###### Proof.

Since @xmath is non-positively curved, the Riemannian universal cover
@xmath is diffeomorphic to @xmath ; in particular, it has trivial
tangent bundle. By the definition of the barycentre, @xmath is the
unique point of @xmath satisfying, for every @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where we were allowed to pass the derivative through the integral sign
thanks to Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem. Indeed, if @xmath ,
then the following estimates hold:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the last function is integrable. ∎

A straightforward computation gives us the following:

###### Lemma 4.7 (Derivatives of the implicit function @xmath).

Using the notation above, the map @xmath is @xmath and for @xmath , the
differential @xmath is non-singular. Hence, for @xmath the map @xmath is
@xmath and satisfies:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Furthermore, if @xmath and @xmath we have:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

###### Proof.

We compute the derivative of the function @xmath with respect to the
variable @xmath . Fix @xmath and @xmath , and take @xmath such that
@xmath . Let @xmath be the geodesic such that @xmath and @xmath . Then:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since @xmath is compact, the curvature of @xmath is bounded from below
by a constant @xmath , and Rauch Comparison Theorem implies that the
Hessian of the function @xmath on @xmath is bounded; namely:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

it follows:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Furthermore, we observe that:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

Observe that Lagrange Theorem implies that, for @xmath sufficiently
small:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since the function @xmath is in @xmath , then by Lebesgue Dominated
Convergence Theorem we can pass the limit through the integral sign.
Moreover, since at @xmath Equality 4.1 implies:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This implies that the integral of the second summand in 4.5 vanishes.
Therefore Equation 4.4 holds, and @xmath is continuous.

Now we compute the derivative of @xmath with respect to the variable
@xmath . Let @xmath , @xmath and @xmath whit @xmath , and let @xmath be
the geodesic such that @xmath and @xmath . Then, the following estimate
holds:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Therefore, for @xmath sufficiently small:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which for for @xmath is a function in @xmath . Hence, Lebesgue Dominated
Convergence Theorem implies:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since @xmath is non-positively curved, the function @xmath is strictly
convex. Therefore, @xmath for every @xmath , and @xmath is non-singular.
Thus, the Implicit Function Theorem implies that @xmath is @xmath , and
Equation 4.2 holds. ∎

###### Lemma 4.8 (Computation of the Jacobian of @xmath ).

Let us fix @xmath , put @xmath and denote by @xmath . Furthermore, let
us introduce the positive quadratic forms @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
defined on @xmath , @xmath and @xmath respectively.

@xmath

@xmath

@xmath
and let us denote by @xmath , @xmath and @xmath the corresponding
endomorphisms of the tangent spaces @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
respectively, and associated to the scalar products @xmath on @xmath and
@xmath on @xmath . Then,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the eigenvalues of @xmath and @xmath are pinched between @xmath and
@xmath .
Moreover, for any @xmath and for any @xmath the following inequality
between the quadratic forms holds:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

###### Proof.

Since @xmath , we have @xmath , hence @xmath . Analogously, we obtain
that @xmath . Since the two quadratic forms @xmath and @xmath are
positive, it follows that all the eigenvalues of @xmath and @xmath are
pinched between @xmath and @xmath . Then, by Lemma 4.7 we have that, for
every @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Therefore, from Equations 4.2 and 4.3 we obtain:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for every @xmath , @xmath . Then, by the Cauchy-Schwartz Formula we get
Inequality 4.7 . In order to prove Inequality 4.8 , we start observing
that it is trivially verified if @xmath , and that @xmath is invertible.
Hence, without loss of generality, we can assume that @xmath is such
that @xmath is invertible. Now we shall derive Inequality 4.8 from
Inequality 4.7 , as follows. Let @xmath be a linear isomorphism between
Euclidean spaces of the same dimension @xmath , and consider positive
bilinear forms @xmath on @xmath and @xmath on @xmath , represented by
the endomorphisms @xmath , @xmath , @xmath with respect to @xmath and
@xmath , respectively, and such that:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since @xmath is an isomorphism, once chosen a @xmath -orthonormal basis
@xmath of @xmath diagonalizing @xmath , we can consider the basis @xmath
obtained by orthonormalizing with respect to @xmath the basis @xmath .
Hence, @xmath can be written as a linear combination of kind @xmath .
Therefore, the matrix representing @xmath with respect to the bases
@xmath and @xmath is upper triangular. Thus:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

∎

### 4.2 Barycenter method and large hyperbolic balls

In the classical application of the barycenter method, when the target
space @xmath is a hyperbolic manifold or satisfy @xmath , a sharp
estimate of the Jacobian is obtained by ( 4.8 ) applying Rauch’s Theorem
in order to estimate the quadratic form @xmath in terms of @xmath , and
then using the following algebraic lemma (see [ BCG95 ] , Appendix D for
a detailed proof).

###### Lemma 4.9 (Algebraic).

Let @xmath with @xmath , and denote by @xmath the set of all the
symmetric endomorphisms @xmath of @xmath whose eigenvalues @xmath
satisfy @xmath , and @xmath . Then, for any @xmath the following
inequality holds:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Furthermore, the value @xmath is realized at the unique point of
absolute maximum @xmath for @xmath .

However, unlike the standard setting where the Hessian of the distance
function of the target space can be explicitly computed (the curvature
being constantly equal to @xmath ), when @xmath the classical estimate
of the Hessian provided by Rauch’s Theorem does not provide a useful
upper bound for @xmath . Nevertheless, in our case the @xmath Riemannian
metrics @xmath are hyperbolic on large portions of our Riemannian
manifolds, so we shall recover an almost optimal estimate for the
Hessian of the distance function,which in combination with ( 4.8 ) will
be sufficient for our purposes.

#### 4.2.1 Jacobi fields along hyperbolic directions

In this paragraph and in the next one we shall explain how to obtain
almost optimal estimates from below for the Hessian of the distance
function on a non-positively curved Riemannian manifold at points which
possess sufficiently large hyperbolic neighbourhoods. In particular,
this sufficiently large radius will be made explicit in terms of the
closeness to the optimal estimate. We shall first prove the following
general:

###### Proposition 4.10.

Let @xmath be a Riemannian manifold, and assume that @xmath is the
unique minimizing geodesic from @xmath to @xmath , and that the
sectional curvatures @xmath of @xmath along @xmath satisfies:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then, for every @xmath and every @xmath such that @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

The unicity of @xmath and the assumption on the sectional curvatures
along @xmath tell us that @xmath does not cross the cut-locus of @xmath
. Let us denote by @xmath . For every @xmath orthogonal to @xmath define
@xmath as the Jacobi field along @xmath satisfying the initial
conditions @xmath , @xmath . For every @xmath let @xmath and @xmath be
the parallel transports of @xmath , @xmath respectively from the point
@xmath to the point @xmath . Since @xmath along @xmath for any @xmath we
see that for @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Let @xmath denote the second fundamental form at @xmath of the geodesic
sphere of radius @xmath centered at @xmath . Recall that:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now we shall prove that the last term is greater or equal to @xmath
where @xmath . Indeed, using the abbreviations:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we get:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which proves the desired estimate. ∎

###### Remark 4.11 (Euristhic interpretation of Proposition 4.10).

The euristhic idea behind the Proposition is the following: let @xmath
be a geodesic ray and let @xmath be the Jacobi field along @xmath with
initial conditions @xmath , @xmath . Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where we denoted by @xmath the parallel transport along the geodesic
@xmath from @xmath to @xmath . Taking the difference between @xmath and
@xmath it is easily seen that:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Hence, travelling in the hyperbolic space straighten up the Jacobi
fields, no matter which initial condition you put. In other words, the
Jacobi field @xmath tends to become closer and closer to its first
covariant derivative @xmath , thus providing a lower bound for @xmath
which becomes asymptotically optimal. Hence, Proposition 4.10 is saying
that given a geodesic which travels in a non-positive direction, we do
not care about whatever the Jacobi field @xmath does before entering in
a hyperbolic direction, but, as far as you travel inside a hyperbolic
direction for a sufficiently large amount of time, the Jacobi field
@xmath will become closer and closer to its first covariant derivative.

#### 4.2.2 Large hyperbolic balls and estimate of @xmath

Using Proposition 4.10 it is easy to show the following result:

###### Lemma 4.12.

Let @xmath be a complete, non-positively curved, simply connected
Riemannian manifold. Let us fix @xmath and @xmath . Assume that the
geodesic ball centred at @xmath of radius @xmath is isometric to @xmath
. Then for every @xmath and for every @xmath we have that:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

###### Proof.

Since, @xmath is outside @xmath the (unique) geodesic from @xmath to
@xmath satisfies the hypotheses of Proposition 4.10 . Estimate ( 4.9 )
then follows from the choice made for @xmath . ∎

From Lemma 4.12 we get an inequality relating @xmath and @xmath , which
will give the required estimate for the jacobian: the following,
immediate corollary says that the (almost optimal) inequality between
these quadratic forms holds, at least at the points having a
sufficiently large hyperbolic neighbourhood:

###### Corollary 4.13 (Estimate of @xmath).

Let @xmath and @xmath . For every @xmath there exists @xmath such that
if @xmath is hyperbolic when restricted to the ball @xmath , then for
every @xmath and @xmath , the following inequality holds:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof of Corollary 4.13.

Recall that the probability measure @xmath involved in the integral
equation defining @xmath is obtained from @xmath by multiplying for
@xmath and normalizing. Furthermore, the following relations hold:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We distinguish two cases. If @xmath , then the statement follows by
multiplying relation @xmath by @xmath , and integrating with respect to
the measure @xmath . Otherwise, if @xmath the computation of the Hessian
of the distance function gives:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

∎

#### 4.2.3 The estimate of the jacobian

We are now ready to prove the next proposition. Even if we will be
interested only in the setting of @xmath -manifolds, we shall keep
writing the dependence on the dimension @xmath , to avoid cumbersome
numerical constants:

###### Proposition 4.14.

With the notation introduced in this chapter, for every @xmath there
exists @xmath such that, if the ball centred at @xmath of radius @xmath
in @xmath is hyperbolic, the following estimate for the jacobian holds:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

We have already proved in Lemma 4.8 that:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Furthermore, it follows from Proposition 4.10 that, if @xmath admits an
hyperbolic ball @xmath then, for any @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Recalling the definition of the quadratic forms @xmath and @xmath , the
last inequality is equivalent to:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus we get:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the last inequality follows applying Lemma 4.9 , once we recall
that the endomorphism @xmath is symmetric, has trace equal to @xmath and
eigenvalues pinched between @xmath and @xmath (see Lemma 4.8 ). ∎

### 4.3 Proof of Theorem 4.1

Let @xmath be an orientable, closed, irreducible @xmath -manifold with
non-trivial @xmath decomposition and at least one hyperbolic @xmath
component. For the application we have in mind, we shall fix the
Riemannian manifold @xmath and we shall consider for every sufficiently
small @xmath as target space @xmath the Riemannian manifold @xmath ,
endowed with the @xmath Riemannian metrics which we found in Chapter
LABEL:section_a_conjectural_minimizing_sequence_irreducible . The
starting map @xmath will be the identity map. Notation will be modified
coherently with these choices. Any possible confusion arising from the
fact that we are considering Riemannian metrics on the same manifold
should be avoided by keeping in mind the general discussion of the
previous section.
Recall that we denoted by @xmath the hyperbolic @xmath components of
@xmath . By the argument used to prove Theorem
LABEL:thm_construction_sequence_on_irreducible_Y and the statement of
Theorem 2.9 we know that for every @xmath and any @xmath there exists an
open subset @xmath of @xmath such that:

1.  @xmath is isometric to the complement of a horoball neighbourhood
    @xmath of the cusps of @xmath ;

2.  @xmath for every @xmath ;

3.  @xmath as @xmath .

For every @xmath , @xmath and @xmath denote by @xmath the subsets of
those points @xmath such that the restriction of @xmath to @xmath is a
smooth Riemannian metric of constant curvature @xmath . By construction
@xmath where we denoted by @xmath the tubular neighbourhood of radius
@xmath . It is straightforward to check that properties (1)—(3) of the
@xmath ’s are satisfied by the @xmath ’s with @xmath . Moreover, the
@xmath satisfy the following additional property:

-   @xmath has curvature constantly equal to @xmath ;

Now, applying Corollary 4.13 to the universal cover, and from the
equivariance of the @xmath ’s we know that:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for every @xmath such that @xmath . Now observe that, using the coaerea
formula:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now use the estimate for @xmath for @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Taking the sum over @xmath and observing that @xmath has zero measure
for @xmath we get that:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now for @xmath , @xmath and @xmath we get:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since @xmath is any Riemannian metric on @xmath we conclude that:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

∎

## Chapter 5 The lower bound via the barycentre method: reducible
@xmath-manifolds

In this Chapter, we shall prove the optimal lower estimate of the
minimal entropy in the case of a reducible @xmath -manifold @xmath . To
this purpose, we shall generalize the notion of barycentre to a @xmath
space. A fundamental role in the estimate of the Volume Entropy will be
played by the metrics that we have defined in Chapter 3 on each
irreducible piece, and the characteristics of the particular family of
(singular) metric spaces we are going to use as target spaces for the
barycenter method.

###### Theorem 5.1.

Let @xmath be a closed, orientable, reducible @xmath -manifold, and
denote by @xmath a minimal decomposition in prime summands. For every
@xmath denote by @xmath the @xmath hyperbolic components of @xmath . Let
@xmath be any Riemannian metric on @xmath . Then:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

As a consequence,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

### 5.1 The family of the target spaces @xmath

Up to reordering the prime decomposition @xmath , we may assume that for
@xmath each @xmath has at least a hyperbolic piece in its @xmath
decomposition, while @xmath is purely graph (or Seifert fibred) for
@xmath . We can assume that the connected sum is realized by performing
the connected sum of every @xmath to the same copy @xmath of @xmath .
This can be done by “sliding" the gluing spheres along @xmath via an
ambient isotopy. Let @xmath , for @xmath be the complement of the ball
@xmath removed from @xmath to realize the connected sum. Now consider
the following space: for any @xmath fix a point @xmath and let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

be the space obtained by shrinking @xmath to a single point @xmath . We
shall denote by @xmath the quotient map, see Figure 5.1 .

By construction, @xmath can be presented as @xmath where @xmath if and
only if @xmath and @xmath for some choice of @xmath . Then @xmath (for
any choice of @xmath ). Let @xmath be the quotient map. Let @xmath be
the unique length metric such that @xmath is an isometry. Since the
metric space @xmath is semi-locally simply connected, it has a universal
covering @xmath , which has a Riemannian structure except at those
points in @xmath where @xmath is a chosen preimage of @xmath .

#### 5.1.1 The universal cover @xmath

@xmath

We now introduce some notation in order to efficiently describe the
universal cover of the singular space @xmath , and the action by
automorphisms of its fundamental group. We remark that, by construction,
the fundamental group of @xmath splits as a free product: @xmath . Let
us denote by @xmath and by @xmath where @xmath is the natural inclusion.
Let @xmath be a lift of @xmath . Roughly speaking, @xmath consists of
@xmath copies of the universal cover @xmath of each manifold @xmath ,
glued along the points of the orbit @xmath . Let us summarize the
structure of @xmath in the next proposition:

###### Proposition 5.2 (On the structure of @xmath).

The universal covering @xmath of @xmath is obtained as follows:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where each @xmath is homeomorphic to @xmath .
Moreover, @xmath if @xmath and @xmath if and only if either @xmath or
@xmath and their intersection is either @xmath for some @xmath or @xmath
for some @xmath . Finally, notice that for every @xmath the point @xmath
belongs to @xmath .

###### Remark 5.3.

Let us observe that using the notation introduced above:

-   @xmath ;

-   for every @xmath we have @xmath ;

#### 5.1.2 The distance function @xmath

First of all remark that, by construction, the distance function @xmath
on the singular space @xmath restricts at any leaf @xmath to the
distance @xmath corresponding to the Riemannian metric on @xmath .
Moreover,

###### Lemma 5.4.

@xmath is a @xmath space.

The Lemma is a classical result about @xmath spaces: indeed, the gluing
of two locally @xmath spaces along convex subsets is still a locally
@xmath space (see [ BH99 ] , Chapter II.11, Theorem 11.1).

#### 5.1.3 Geodesic balls in @xmath

Let @xmath be any point in the universal cover of @xmath , and fix
@xmath . It is worth for the sequel to have a good intuition of what the
geodesic ball @xmath looks like. Roughly speaking, the ball of radius
@xmath centred at any point @xmath is the union of some metric balls
with respect to the metrics @xmath defined on each leaf @xmath . More
precisely, pick a point @xmath and fix @xmath . By construction, @xmath
is a copy of @xmath , and the restriction of the singular metric @xmath
coincides with @xmath .
If @xmath , then @xmath . Otherwise, the Riemannian ball @xmath ramifies
at points @xmath where @xmath is an element of @xmath for every @xmath ,
and for every @xmath the intersection @xmath coincides with the
Riemannian ball @xmath . The balls keep ramifying until there are no
singular points in its restriction to the leaves. In the end we obtain
the following description (see Figure 5.4 for an evoking image):

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

### 5.2 Barycenter in a CAT(0) space

In this section we shall adapt the notion of barycenter of a measure in
the wider context of @xmath spaces. The resulting notion will generalize
the one in [ BCG95 ] and [ Sam99 ] . To start with, we shall derive an
elementary result of Euclidean geometry, which turns out to be
fundamental in defining the generalized version of the barycenter. First
of all, we introduce some notation. We shall denote with capitol letters
points in the Euclidean space @xmath and with tiny letters points in
other metric spaces. Moreover, given three points @xmath we will denote
by @xmath the triangle in @xmath having them as vertices, while given
@xmath we will denote by @xmath the geodesic triangle having them as
vertices. Moreover, in the Euclidean space we will denote by @xmath the
segment with endpoints @xmath and @xmath , and with @xmath the oriented
segment with endpoints @xmath and @xmath , parameterized so that @xmath
is its source and @xmath is its target. Moreover, we will denote by
@xmath the geodesic segment joining @xmath and @xmath . Finally, we
denote by @xmath the square length of the segment @xmath .

###### Lemma 5.5.

Let @xmath be a triangle in the @xmath , and take a point @xmath on the
side @xmath . Then, the following relation between the lengths of the
sides holds:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

Let us parameterize the side @xmath as the interval @xmath , and choose
@xmath such that @xmath and @xmath . Let us denote by @xmath . Then we
have:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

Similarly,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Putting together Equations 5.1 and 5.2 , we finally get:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Hence,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the required equality holds plugging @xmath and @xmath in the last
one. ∎

###### Lemma 5.6.

Let @xmath be a @xmath space, let @xmath be any geodesic triangle. Then,
for any @xmath the following inequality holds:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

Let us construct the comparison triangle @xmath for @xmath in the
Euclidean space. Let @xmath be the point dividing the segment @xmath in
the same proportion as @xmath divides @xmath . By the definition of
comparison triangle we have: @xmath @xmath and by construction @xmath
and @xmath . Furthermore, the @xmath assumption implies @xmath , and we
get:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

∎

Now we shall exploit the previous lemma to prove the existence and
uniqueness of the barycenter.

###### Proposition 5.7.

Let @xmath be a positive measure on a @xmath space @xmath such that
there exists a point @xmath satisfying:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

and consider the associated Leibniz function

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This function is continuous on @xmath and @xmath when @xmath . Moreover,
the following conditions hold:

-    the function @xmath has a unique minimum point @xmath , called the
    barycenter of @xmath ;

-    for any @xmath , we have

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

###### Remark 5.8.

We remark that the hypothesis provided by Inequality 5.3 simultaneously
ensures that @xmath is a finite measure on @xmath , and the functions
@xmath and @xmath are in @xmath .

###### Proof of Propositon 5.7.

Let us show first that the function @xmath is continuous on X. Let us
fix @xmath . For @xmath the following chain of estimates holds:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The function @xmath does not depend on @xmath , and is @xmath
-integrable by assumption. Hence for @xmath such that @xmath the @xmath
-integrable functions @xmath are converging pointwise to the @xmath
-integrable function @xmath and are smaller than or equal to @xmath .
Thus Lebesgue’s Dominated Convergence Theorem implies the continuity of
@xmath .

Now, remark that @xmath as @xmath . Indeed, recalling the elementary
inequality @xmath , we get

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

We conclude observing that @xmath , and by assumption @xmath .

Existence. The last two properties imply that there exist points @xmath
such that @xmath ; namely there exists at least a minimum for the
function @xmath . Now we shall prove that this minimum value is attained
at a unique point.

Uniqueness. Let @xmath be a point as above, i.e. , a point realizing the
minimum for the function @xmath . Then Lemma 5.6 implies that, for any
@xmath and for any @xmath (where by @xmath we intend the —unique—
geodesic segment joining the two points) we have:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Integrating the last inequality with respect to the measure @xmath , we
get:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the first inequality holds as @xmath is a minimum for @xmath .
Thus we have:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Multiplying the last relation by @xmath and letting the distance @xmath
go to zero, we obtain:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which is clearly equivalent to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

We stress here that Inequality ( 5.4 ) is precisely the point @xmath of
the statement. Now assume that @xmath and @xmath are two points where
the function @xmath achieves its minimum. Then Inequality ( 5.4 )
implies:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

whence @xmath and @xmath . This completes the proof of the uniqueness
statement. ∎

### 5.3 The natural maps

Let @xmath be any Riemannian metric on @xmath ; we shall denote by
@xmath the Riemannian distance on @xmath and by @xmath the Riemannian
metric and distance on @xmath respectively. Moreover, for every @xmath
we shall denote @xmath the sequence of Riemannian metrics on the
irreducible manifold @xmath constructed as in Chapter
LABEL:section_a_conjectural_minimizing_sequence_irreducible .
Furthermore, we denote by @xmath , the distance function from a fixed
point @xmath . Let us consider the following immersion of @xmath into
the space @xmath of finite, positive Borel measures on @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for @xmath and let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

be the lift of the quotient map @xmath . Then we compose the latter map
with the push-forward via @xmath , thus obtaining the (finite, positive,
Borel) measures @xmath in @xmath . Let @xmath denote the Leibniz
function associated with the measure @xmath , that is:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since @xmath is a @xmath space (Lemma 5.4 ) it follows from Proposition
5.7 that @xmath admits a unique minimum point for every @xmath . Hence,
for every @xmath we define the map

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and we shall refer to the maps @xmath as to the natural maps on @xmath .

### 5.4 Properties of the natural maps

We shall now list the properties of the natural maps @xmath .

#### 5.4.1 Equivariance, homotopy type, surjectivity

To begin with, we shall observe that the natural maps @xmath are @xmath
-equivariant, where @xmath is the homomorphism induced by @xmath —where
@xmath .

###### Lemma 5.9 (Equivariance).

Choose a point @xmath . The natural maps @xmath are @xmath -equivariant
with respect to the surjective homomorphism @xmath

###### Proof.

As in the irreducible case we have that @xmath , and thus we obtain the
@xmath -equivariance of the natural maps. ∎

Since the maps @xmath are @xmath -equivariant, they induce maps @xmath
between the quotients. Now observe that:

###### Lemma 5.10 (Homotopy type).

For every @xmath and every @xmath the natural map @xmath is homotopic to
@xmath .

###### Proof.

The proof goes as in the irreducible case, once observed that @xmath is
an aspherical @xmath -complex. ∎

Finally, we observe that:

###### Lemma 5.11 (Surjectivity).

For every @xmath the natural map @xmath is surjective.

###### Proof.

Observe that @xmath where @xmath is the natural inclusion. For every
@xmath let us denote by @xmath the map sending @xmath identically into
@xmath and @xmath into @xmath (the point on @xmath identified to @xmath
). Let us consider @xmath , then @xmath . Moreover, we have that @xmath
. On the other hand, for every @xmath the map @xmath is homotopic to the
map @xmath , hence @xmath — i.e. @xmath has degree @xmath , which
implies the surjectivity of the map @xmath . Since this holds for every
@xmath and the space @xmath is obtained by identifying for @xmath the
points @xmath to @xmath we conclude that @xmath is surjective. ∎

#### 5.4.2 Regularity

In this paragraph we shall be concerned with derivatives of the @xmath
’s wherever this makes sense. Notice that @xmath has a Riemannian
manifold structure outside the set @xmath . Hence, it makes sense to
consider derivatives outside this set. Notice that, since we are dealing
with a singular space, we have to face some difficulties concerning the
regularity of the distance function. In this section we shall explain
how this issue can be circumvented. We start proving the following
lemma.

###### Lemma 5.12 (Regularity).

The function @xmath is @xmath on @xmath .

Since @xmath is obtained by integrating @xmath , Lemma 5.12 is a
consequence of the next Lemma, concerning the regularity of the function
@xmath , and of Lebesgue’s Dominated Convergence Theorem.

###### Lemma 5.13.

Let @xmath be any point. The function @xmath is @xmath on @xmath

###### Proof.

Let @xmath . Assume that @xmath and @xmath . Since @xmath , @xmath are
convex subsets of @xmath we can define @xmath , @xmath as the
projections on these subsets. By construction it is readily seen that
@xmath and @xmath , for suitably chosen @xmath , @xmath (depending only
on @xmath , @xmath ). Then,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Notice that, once @xmath has been fixed, the first summand @xmath and
the second summand @xmath are constant as long as @xmath varies in
@xmath . Moreover, by construction, the restriction of @xmath to @xmath
is equal to the Riemannian distance function on @xmath (and similarly
the restriction of @xmath to @xmath ). Hence, there exists a constant
@xmath such that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

for every point @xmath . By this remark, it is clear that we can take
derivatives up to the second order (recall that the Riemannian metrics
@xmath ’s are @xmath ) of @xmath at every point @xmath , using the
Levi-Civita connection with respect to the metric @xmath of the
appropriate leaf @xmath to which @xmath belongs. ∎

Since we arleady know that for every @xmath the minimum of @xmath is
attained at unique point, i.e. the barycentre @xmath of the measure
@xmath , Lemma 5.12 allows us to give the following characterization of
@xmath when @xmath . The proofs of the following Lemmata 5.14 , 5.15 and
5.16 follow exactly the same line as those of Lemmata 4.6 , 4.7 and 4.8
in Chapter 4 .

###### Lemma 5.14 (The implicit equation at manifold points).

For every @xmath , @xmath and every @xmath such that @xmath , the point
@xmath is characterized by the equation:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

In other words, the map @xmath is univocally determined on the
complement of the preimage of the singular set @xmath by the vectorial
implicit equation @xmath , where @xmath is defined as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is a global @xmath -orthonormal basis for the tangent space
@xmath where @xmath for some @xmath , and @xmath .

Since @xmath we are allowed to take derivatives (up to the first order)
of the function @xmath . Hence, for those @xmath such that @xmath we
have:

###### Lemma 5.15 (Derivatives of the implicit function @xmath).

Using the notation introduced above, the map @xmath is @xmath and for
@xmath , the differential @xmath is non-singular. Hence, for @xmath the
map @xmath is @xmath and satisfies:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Furthermore, if @xmath and @xmath we have:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Finally, we have the following estimate of the Jacobian of the map
@xmath at those points @xmath such that @xmath :

###### Lemma 5.16 (Computation of the Jacobian of @xmath ).

Let us fix @xmath such that @xmath and define

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Furthermore, let us introduce the positive quadratic forms @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath defined on @xmath , @xmath and @xmath respectively.

@xmath

@xmath

@xmath
and let us denote by @xmath , @xmath and @xmath the corresponding
endomorphisms of the tangent spaces @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
respectively, and associated to the scalar products @xmath on @xmath
(where we are assuming @xmath ) and @xmath on @xmath . Then,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the eigenvalues of @xmath and @xmath are pinched between @xmath and
@xmath . Notice that we denoted for simplicity @xmath the trace with
respect to the Riemannian metric on @xmath given by the restriction of
@xmath .
Moreover, for any @xmath and for any @xmath the following inequality
between the quadratic forms holds:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the next paragraph we shall obtain an estimate for the Hessian of
@xmath outside the singular set, which together with Lemma 5.16 will
give the lower bound of the Minimal Entropy in the reducible case.

### 5.5 The Hessian of @xmath on @xmath

By Lemma 5.16 , in order to estimate @xmath we need to provide a good
upper bound for the quadratic form @xmath . To this purpose we shall
need an estimate of the Hessian of @xmath where @xmath . This will be
done by looking at @xmath as the second fundamental form @xmath of the
distance sphere @xmath with center @xmath and radius @xmath , computed
at @xmath .

###### Lemma 5.17 (Hessian of @xmath).

Let us fix a point @xmath and a point @xmath . Then @xmath .

###### Proof.

Since @xmath we know that there exists a unique @xmath and a unique
@xmath such that @xmath . By construction of @xmath the intersection of
the geodesic sphere @xmath passing through @xmath with the leaf @xmath
is equal to @xmath where @xmath . But @xmath is isometric to a suitable
@xmath –geodesic sphere of the same radius in @xmath . Thus:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where in the second equality we denoted by @xmath the Riemannian
distance function @xmath from the point @xmath ; the third equality
comes from Equation 5.5 . ∎

### 5.6 An approximated version of Rauch’s Comparison Theorem

From now on, we proceed following the same lines of the proof of the
irreducible case, paying some extra care due to the presence of the
singular points. Recall that we denoted @xmath for @xmath the points
identified to the singular point @xmath .

###### Proposition 5.18.

For every @xmath define @xmath . Assume that @xmath is such that, for
any @xmath and @xmath , the intersection @xmath is either empty or is a
hyperbolic ball; then for every @xmath and @xmath the following
inequality holds:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Proof.

We may assume that @xmath . Recall that we denoted by @xmath the
projection onto the convex subspace @xmath . In order to prove
Proposition 5.18 we need to distinguish two cases: the case where @xmath
and the case where @xmath . In the first case, observe that the second
fundamental form @xmath of the ball of radius @xmath —where we denote
with @xmath the Riemannian distance function on @xmath — coincides with
the second fundamental form in the hyperbolic case. Hence, for @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where we used the notation @xmath for the Riemannian distance function
from @xmath in @xmath . Otherwise, the distance between @xmath and
@xmath is greater than @xmath , and we can apply Lemma 4.12 in
restriction to @xmath , thus obtaining:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

∎

### 5.7 The Jacobian estimate

We are now ready to apply the inequalities found in Lemma 5.16 and
Proposition 5.18 , to derive an almost optimal inequality for the
Jacobian of the maps @xmath valid on an appropriately chosen subset of
@xmath .

###### Proposition 5.19 (Jacobian Estimate, reducible case).

For every @xmath there exists @xmath such that, if the ball centred at
the non-singular point @xmath of radius @xmath is such that @xmath is
hyperbolic for every @xmath , and every @xmath , the following estimate
for the Jacobian holds:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Proof.

Let @xmath and assume that @xmath satisfies the assumptions. Then by
Proposition 5.18 we know that, at the point @xmath the following
inequality holds:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for every @xmath . Integrating in @xmath and normalizing by @xmath we
get the following inequality between quadratic forms

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and hence we obtain the inequality between the symmetric endomorphisms:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now, using this inequality, Lemma 5.16 and Lemma 4.9 we obtain:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which is the desired inequality. ∎

### 5.8 Proof of Theorem 5.1

The proof of Theorem 5.1 partly relies on the proof of Theorem 4.1 . For
every @xmath and every @xmath we shall denote by @xmath the collection
of open subsets of @xmath constructed in the proof of Theorem 5.1 , when
@xmath does not admit a complete hyperbolic metric. Otherwise we shall
choose @xmath . By construction of the metrics @xmath (where @xmath is
the —unique— hyperbolic metric for every @xmath which is of hyperbolic
type) and by Proposition 5.19 we have that:

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

for every @xmath . On the other hand we have that for every fixed @xmath
the volume @xmath converges as @xmath to @xmath . Now observe that:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the first equality comes from the coarea formula and the second
from the fact that the @xmath ’s are disjoint. Plugging the inequality
for the Jacobian into the formula, we see that:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now for every fixed @xmath the left-hand side of the latter inequality
converges to @xmath as @xmath . Since this holds for every choice of
@xmath it is easily seen that:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

As Inequality ( 5.12 ) holds for every Riemannian metric @xmath on
@xmath we have the following estimate from below for @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

## Appendix A Smooth and Riemannian orbifolds

This appendix is devoted to the introduction of smooth and Riemannian
orbifolds. For further details, we recommend [ BMP03 ] and [ KL14 ] .

#### a.0.1 Definition and basic notions

###### Definition A.1.

A smooth @xmath -orbifold is a metrizable topological space @xmath
endowed with a collection @xmath , called an atlas , where for every
@xmath @xmath is an open subset of @xmath , @xmath is an open subset of
@xmath , @xmath is a continuous map (called a chart ) and @xmath is a
finite group of diffeomorphisms of @xmath satisfying the following
conditions:

1.  The @xmath ’s cover @xmath .

2.  Each @xmath factors through a homeomorphism between @xmath and
    @xmath .

3.  The charts are compatible in the following sense: for every @xmath
    and @xmath with @xmath , there is a diffeomorphism @xmath between a
    neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath and a neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath
    such that @xmath for all @xmath .

For convenience, we shall assume that the atlas is maximal.

We remark that an orbifold @xmath is a manifold if all the groups @xmath
are trivial. Given an orbifold @xmath , we denote by @xmath its
underlying space, i.e. the topological space obtained by neglecting the
orbifold structure.

Let @xmath be any point; then the local group of @xmath at @xmath is the
group @xmath defined as follows: pick any chart @xmath , where @xmath .
Then @xmath is the stabilizer of any point of @xmath under the action of
@xmath . It turns out that the group @xmath is well defined up to
isomorphism. We say that the point @xmath is regular if @xmath is
trivial, otherwise @xmath is singular . Notice that the set of singular
points is empty if and only if @xmath is a manifold.

There are several notions that can be defined in the orbifold context,
extending in a straightforward manner the analogous notion given for
manifolds.

The boundary of @xmath , denoted @xmath , is the set of points @xmath
such that there exists a chart at @xmath , @xmath such that @xmath . The
orbifold @xmath is called the interior of @xmath . We call @xmath
orientable if it has an atlas such that each @xmath and every element of
each @xmath are orientation preserving.

###### Observation.

Let @xmath be an orbifold with boundary, and assume that all the
singular points are conical points, i.e. the group @xmath acts by
rotation. Let @xmath be a boundary point. Then, there exists a chart
@xmath at @xmath such that @xmath , and the group @xmath is trivial.
Thus, there is a neighbourhood of the boundary such that the local
groups are trivial.

#### a.0.2 Maps between orbifolds

A map between two orbifolds @xmath and @xmath is a continuous map @xmath
such that for every @xmath there are charts @xmath and @xmath such that
@xmath and the restriction @xmath can be lifted to a smooth map @xmath
which is equivariant with respect to some homomorphism @xmath . A map
@xmath is an immersion (resp. a submersion ) if the lifts @xmath are
immersions (resp. submersions). An embedding is an immersion whose
underlying map is a homeomorphism with the image. A diffeomorphism is a
surjective embedding.

#### a.0.3 Orbifold covering

A covering of an orbifold @xmath is an orbifold @xmath with a continuous
map @xmath , called a covering map , such that every point @xmath has a
neighbourhood @xmath with the following property: for each component
@xmath of @xmath there is a chart @xmath such that @xmath is a chart.

We say that an orbifold is good if it is covered by a manifold, bad
otherwise. If an orbifold is finitely covered by a manifold we say that
it is very good .

The notions of deck transformation group and universal covering extend
to the context of orbifolds, see [ Thu97 ] and [ BMP03 ] .
The fundamental group of @xmath , denoted by @xmath , is the deck
transformation group of its universal covering.

There is an interpretation of the fundamental group in terms of loops,
keeping track of the passage through the singular locus. Furthermore, a
continuous map between two orbifolds gives rise to a map between the
corresponding orbifold fundamental groups.

#### a.0.4 Riemannian orbifolds

A Riemannin metric on an orbifold @xmath is given by an atlas for @xmath
along with a collection of Riemannian metric on the @xmath ’s so that:

1.  @xmath acts isometrically on @xmath for every @xmath ;

2.  The diffeomorphism @xmath is an isometry.

We say that a map @xmath between Riemannian orbifolds is a Riemannian
submersion (resp. a Riemannian immersion) if the lift @xmath is a
Riemannian submersion (resp. a Riemannian immersion ) equivariant with
respect to the isometric actions of the local groups.

###### Remark A.2.

Let @xmath and @xmath be two orbifolds that are global quotients of two
Riemannian manifolds @xmath and @xmath with respect to groups of
isometries @xmath and @xmath acting properly. Then, a Riemannian
submersion between @xmath and @xmath is equivalent to a Riemannian
submersion between @xmath and @xmath which is equivariant with respect
to the action of @xmath and @xmath .

## Appendix B Proof of Proposition 2.8

###### Lemma B.1.

Let @xmath such that:

1.   [label=., ref=()]

2.  @xmath for every @xmath ;

3.  @xmath

4.  @xmath

Then there exists @xmath , @xmath arbitrarily small, such that there
exists a function @xmath satisfying the following properties:

1.  @xmath for @xmath and @xmath for @xmath

2.  @xmath for every @xmath

3.  @xmath

###### Proof.

Property @xmath implies that there exists @xmath such that, for @xmath ,
inequality @xmath holds. Let us choose @xmath ; then it si possible to
construct a function @xmath such that @xmath , @xmath and @xmath .
Furthermore, we can choose @xmath such that @xmath . Moreover, since
@xmath there exists @xmath such that for @xmath inequality @xmath holds
for @xmath . Thus, provided @xmath :

Then there exists @xmath arbitrarily small and @xmath such that:

1.  @xmath for every @xmath ;

2.  @xmath for @xmath ;

3.  @xmath

###### Proof.

Denote by @xmath . Then, @xmath satisfies the hypotheses of Lemma B.1
and applying it we get a function @xmath such that properties a,b,c of
Lemma B.1 hold. Let us define:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We show that @xmath satisfies property @xmath .
For @xmath ,

Thus @xmath for @xmath .
For @xmath

Furthermore,

  -- -- --

where Inequality @xmath follows by Lemma B.1 .

For @xmath , the same computation just held gives:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Finally, we observe that property a of Lemma B.1 implies the thesis A ,
and part B of the thesis follows from property b .

∎

###### Proposition B.3.

For every fixed @xmath there exists @xmath arbitrarily small and @xmath
such that:

1.  @xmath is not increasing and convex, such that

###### Proof.

The function @xmath satisfies the differential equation @xmath , with
initial conditions

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Let us denote by @xmath the solution of the differential equation @xmath
with the same initial conditions. Namely,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Straightforward computations show that, for @xmath , the function @xmath
is more convex than @xmath , and @xmath has a unique stationary point,
which turns to be a minimum, at @xmath . We denote by @xmath the
corresponding minimal value.

We define the following function:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We observe that @xmath , but is not @xmath . Furthermore, @xmath is not
increasing, convex and satisfies condition @xmath . Moreover, we observe
that, for every @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

Indeed, on the interval @xmath the following inequality holds:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and @xmath , @xmath . Then, by Sturm-Liouville Theorem, @xmath and
@xmath and

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

The latter Inequality implies Equation B.1 . In order to obtain a @xmath
function satisfying the required properties we will apply (twice) Lemma
B.2 , as follows.

Firstly, we observe that @xmath satisfies the hypotheses of Lemma B.2 ;
hence, there exists a function @xmath , enjoying properties @xmath . In
particular, @xmath is convex, not increasing, and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We claim that @xmath satisfies properties @xmath and @xmath . Indeed,
Lemma B.2 implies:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for @xmath . Thus:

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

Now choose @xmath so that, in particular, @xmath ; then we have

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

Thus,

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

where the latter inequality holds provided that @xmath . Thus, @xmath
satisfies Property @xmath .
We claim that @xmath also satisfies Property @xmath . Lemma B.2 implies:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Hence we have:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We choose @xmath , so that @xmath . With this choice,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and so

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the latter inequality holds provided that @xmath .

Let us define @xmath . We observe that @xmath , @xmath and @xmath .
Furthermore, @xmath satisfies the hypothesis of Lemma B.2 . Then there
exists @xmath sufficiently small, and a convex function @xmath such
that:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Furthermore, @xmath satisfies:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

In order to prove that @xmath satisfies Property @xmath , we perform the
following estimates, exploiting Equation B.2 :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the latter inequality holds provided that we have chosen @xmath
sufficiently small so that @xmath .

We remark that @xmath . We choose @xmath sufficiently small so that
@xmath ; thus we have:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Hence, recalling Inequality B.2

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the second inequality holds if we choose @xmath small enough so
that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Finally, we check that @xmath satisfies Property @xmath . Exploiting
Equation B.3 we obtain:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We choose @xmath sufficiently small so that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the latter inequality holds provided that @xmath is sufficiently
small so that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Finally, we call

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

so that @xmath for @xmath , and we define

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By construction, this function satisfies the required properties.
