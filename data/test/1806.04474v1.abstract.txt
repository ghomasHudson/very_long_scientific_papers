This thesis makes several significant contributions to the theory of both Regenerating (RG) and Locally Recoverable (LR) codes. The two principal contributions are characterizing the optimal rate of an LR code designed to recover from t erased symbols sequentially, for any t and the development of a tight bound on the sub-packetization level (length of a vector code symbol) of a sub-class of RG codes called optimal-access RG codes. There are however, several other notable contributions as well such as deriving the tightest-known bounds on the performance metrics such as minimum distance and rate of a sub-class of LR codes known as availability codes. The thesis also presents some low field size constructions of Maximal Recoverable codes.
