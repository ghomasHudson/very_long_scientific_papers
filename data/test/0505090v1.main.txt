## Chapter 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Proposition

String Theory is a tribute to human imagination. A line of research in
which a few scientists embarked thirty years ago, which appeared to be a
promising candidate to solve the intriguing enigma of Quantum Gravity.
As of today, this goal still seems far away, but the fascination String
Theory exerts on scientists is so great that they just keep going as if
the years elapsed did not matter the slightest. Science is after all
proliferous in cases where seemingly impossible breakthroughs were the
outcome of enduring work on ideas that looked strange at first. As
examples of this we can cite General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics or,
in a more distant past, the invention of Calculus.

Flashing back to the early 1900s’, we realize the phenomena scientists
observed at the time must have looked to them very, very strange.
Indeed, the results of many experiments blatantly escaped common sense
and seemed to have no relation to anything known thus far. What logic
could there be in equally prepared experiments giving different results
every time? Or, how could someone be convinced that if his brother were
to fly in a spaceship, he would return to Earth twenty years younger?
Yet these questions have been answered. The key for finding the answers
was imagination. Imagination freed the scientists’ minds from the
clutches of the prejudice of determinism and made possible a rational
interpretation to the chaos of contradicting experiments.

The flamboyant examples of Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity are
perhaps misleading, for imagination and preserverance more often than
not take their time to sort matters out. For instance, it took well over
three centuries to prove Fermat’s last theorem. We can also cite
Apollonius of Perga, who had to wait more than 2000 years before his
study of conical sections was used by Kepler to explain the orbits of
planets. It is therefore not to say when should the quest of unifying
the fundamental forces of Nature be accomplished, for it has barely
started.

String Theory is one of the candidates for realizing unification.
Despite its eerie formulation and some disheartening technicalities, it
still seems the best one. The good perturbative behavior of String
Theory and natural appearance of gravitons are nice indicators that we
are on the right track. String Theory also stimulated progress in
various branches of Mathematics and provided possible explanations for
several cosmological observations. Coincidence or not, it is, for
instance, possible to derive formulas for black-hole entropy from String
Theory. The path it treads is however so widespread that the number of
possible scenarios for the Universe is immense. This book tells the
story of one of them.

### 1.2 Past, present and future

#### 1.2.1 Strings from hadronic models

The upsurge of particle accelerators in the early 1960’s brought forth
many surprises. One of the intriguing facts observed was the
mass-squared behavior of hadronic resonances, which seemed to be linear
with spin

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

This behavior seemed to go on indefinitely, so it was not plausible that
all these resonances were fundamental and even if one took them as so,
the high spins meant bad high-energy behavior of tree-level amplitudes
and certain renormalization trouble. Trying to find a way around these
problems, in 1968 Veneziano proposed the hadron scattering amplitude [ 1
]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

This amplitude is exponentially soft at high energies in all kinematic
regimes, even though it includes contributions from particles of all
spins ¹ ¹ 1 This can be seen, for example, from the pole structure. .
However, while exponential decay at high energies matched experimental
results in some kinematic regimes, it did not match the observed
power-law decay in others. The power-law decay is nowadays interpreted
as a signal of partonic structure, and Veneziano’s amplitude failure to
reproduce this was the chief reason for its demise.

Later in the 1970’s a much better description of the strong interactions
appeared in the form of QCD, the mass spectrum being interpreted as
spin-orbit excitations of the constituent quarks. With this the
Veneziano model was finally abandoned as theory of hadronic
interactions. It was however noticed that the amplitude @xmath wasn’t
irrelevant. It actually described scattering of quantum strings.

#### 1.2.2 Strings as quantum gravity?

The subject remained dormant for a while until later on some physicists
noticed that the pole @xmath of the corresponding Veneziano formula for
closed strings signaled a massless spin-2 particle. The only known
consistent field theory of massless spin-2 particles is gravity. Could
this pole be the graviton?

The Veneziano amplitude is an amplitude for string scattering, so, in
this way String Theory became a proposal for a theory of Quantum
Gravity. Quantum Gravity arises when radiative corrections to General
Relativity due to one-graviton exchange become important. This happens
at the so-called Planck scale

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

This length scale is unfortunately too small for accelerator reach.
However, recent developments show us that there may be ways around this
problem.

The first attempt at a String Theory produced, as we shall see below,
more than was desired. For example, the graviton didn’t come out of the
mass spectrum alone - it came together with tachyons, particles of
negative mass-squared, whose phenomenological interpretation was
problematic, to say the least. Also, the absence of space-time fermions
wasn’t that good an omen either, as wasn’t the existence of critical
dimensions for the quantized theory. Nevertheless, these problems have
been successfully dealt with and at the end of the day, five Superstring
Theories were obtained, that are believed to be completely consistent in
@xmath space-time dimensions. But ten space-time dimensions is more than
the four we see around us and therefore something had to be done with
the six extra dimensions.

#### 1.2.3 Compactification and extended objects

The first proposal to deal with the critical dimension problem was to
compactify the extra dimensions via the Kaluza-Klein mechanism. Since
one has to curl-up six dimensions, the possibilities for the
compactification manifold are more than many. In the middle the plethora
of choices, a phenomenologically interesting model arose. This was the
compactification of the heterotic @xmath superstring on a Calabi-Yau
manifold [ 2 ] . The compactification process breaks one of the @xmath
gauge symmetries in such a way that in the four-dimensional world, one
gets the Standard Model group @xmath , with four generations of
fermions. The model had however some problems, like gauge coupling
hierarchy [ 3 ] , but it marked nevertheless the beginning of string
phenomenology.

In 1995 D-branes, extended objects of String Theory, were discovered [ 4
] and with it a new piece of the puzzle fit in. The D-branes are
non-perturbative objects, hyper-surfaces where open strings can end.
Their discovery allowed briefly afterwards the establishment of a net of
dualities relating the various Superstring Theories, which culminated
with the postulation of the existence of an eleven-dimensional unified
theory, M-theory, which would in different asymptotic regimes reduce to
the five known String Theories. From the net of dualities came also the
AdS/CFT correspondence [ 5 ] , a interesting duality which relates gauge
theories to gravity ones.

The D-branes can accommodate gauge theories in their world-volume. This
opened the possibility of the so-called Brane World Scenario [ 6 ] . In
such a scenario, one assumes that our four-dimensional world is confined
to live on the world-volume of a D-brane. This allows the extra
dimensions to grow very large. Large extra dimensions lower the string
scale, which can eventually drop as low as the TeV scale, giving string
phenomenology a whole new perspective, perhaps even an experimental one.
Other scenarios featuring D-branes and their close relatives, the
orientifold O-planes, can be setup to try and understand cosmological
puzzles such as black-hole entropy or Hawking radiation.

#### 1.2.4 Prospects

The recent developments opened many new windows to String Theory, and
the topics mentioned above are but a small fraction of what experts are
dealing with currently. Today, the subject and its branches undergoes a
growing researching frenzy as the start of the running of the Large
Hadron Collider at CERN approaches. This accelerator will, amongst many
things, probe the energy scales where Supersymmetry, a key feature of
String Theory, is belied to be restored. If the existence of
Supersymmetry is indeed confirmed, it will forever stand as one of the
great achievements of Theoretical Physics, for it was postulated relying
solely on theoretical symmetry arguments.

With so many subjects being frantically researched at the same time, the
next years promise to be a rich period in intellectual endeavor. For
String Theory is indeed a fascinating subject whose details interest
mathematicians and physicists alike.

### 1.3 This work

This thesis focuses on one of the basic ingredients of String Theory:
Conformal Field Theory. As the string evolves in space-time, it sweeps
out a two-dimensional world-sheet, in which a two-dimensional conformal
field theory lives. To first approximation, the field theory living in
space-time is a mapping from the world-sheet theory to space-time. Thus,
studying the world-sheet theory enables us to understand the structure
of space-time.

The conformal symmetry that the world-sheet enjoys at classical level
does not get through to the quantum level. In general, it acquires
quantum corrections due to the presence of an anomaly. Quantum anomalies
are complicated to deal with and normally bar a theory from being
consistent. In String Theory, if one interprets matters in the right
way, the accursed quantum conformal anomaly can be dispelled and turned
into a blessing instead. The point is that in a path-integral
quantization procedure, the classical gauge symmetries of the string
world-sheet generate Faddeev-Popov ghosts, which contribute to conformal
anomaly. Their contribution can however be canceled by adding the
contribution of the world-sheet bosonic and fermionic fields. Since one
needs to add a precise number of world-sheet fields, this procedure
normally leads to the appearing of a very definite critical dimension.
The blessing appears now because we are not obliged to add exclusively
world-sheet bosons and fermions. We can add whatever conformal fields we
please, as long as we do it in a consistent manner. In this way, what we
get in the end of the day is an algebraic alternative to
compactification.

Of particular interest for this work are string theories that have open
strings. The presence of open strings introduces surfaces with
boundaries - the world-sheet boundaries drawn by the end points of the
open strings. This makes it necessary to formulate conformal field
theory on such surfaces. Two open strings can join to create one closed
string, which means one must consider open and closed surfaces alike.
Because the end points of open strings can end on D-branes, one has to
consider these extended objects as well. Not only that, one must also
consider their relatives, the orientifold O-planes. One way to see that
they should be included is to note that D-branes carry so-called
Ramond-Ramond charges, whose flux lines must end somewhere. If the
D-brane fills out the whole of space-time, the flux lines cannot escape
and must therefore end on a surface of negative Ramond-Ramond charge.
The O-planes carry this sort of charge in String Theory, and therefore
they should be present. The O-planes act as mirrors in a sense: they
truncate the string spectrum to states invariant under world-sheet
orientation reversal. In the presence of O-planes, the string theory
becomes unoriented. At the level of the world-sheet, this means
crosscaps are added to the array of surfaces drawn out by strings. In
the end, an open string theory means one has to consider conformal field
theory on four types of surfaces: closed or open, oriented or
unoriented. Because of this, throughout this thesis, by the words ‘open
string theory’ it will be meant a theory of both open and closed
unoriented strings.

In this work we search for open string conformal field theories with
conformal anomaly @xmath which can be consistently added to the
world-sheet theory and take the first steps towards proving consistency
of the resulting model to all orders in string perturbation theory. The
Feynman diagrams of point-particle quantum field theory have analogs in
String Theory. Put simply, in String Theory one replaces the propagator
lines of point-particles for tubes or strips representing propagation of
closed and open strings respectively. The surfaces obtained can, as in
quantum field theory, include loop-like configurations. In open string
theory they can also and have boundaries and crosscaps, which allow the
open and closed strings to draw surfaces like the annulus, the Klein
bottle or the Moebius strip in space-time. Constructing the partition
functions for the open string theory at one-loop order, one can write
down very simple constraint equations that enable us to write down the
spectrum of the theory and do some basic consistency checks. Going
further into the details of the conformal field theory we can find its
chiral four-point functions, which can be used to extract fusing and
braiding matrices, which can in turn be used to test the consistency of
the theory to all orders in perturbation theory via the induction
mechanism of the so-called sewing constraints [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] .

This thesis is organized as follows. In chapter 2 a review of the
bosonic string is presented as motivation for String Theory and to
clarify and motivate the algebraic approach. In chapter 3 conformal
field theory is reviewed. In chapter 4 the construction of open strings
is presented and an interesting result is found. In chapter 5 the open
string construction is used to derive results for @xmath orbifold
theories. In chapter 6 consistency of string perturbation theory is
discussed and in chapter 7 correlators of the orbifold theory are used
to derive some of the chiral quantities needed to test perturbative
consistency. Finally, in chapter 8 conclusions and prospects for future
work are discussed.

## Chapter 2 The Bosonic String

### 2.1 Classical String Theory

The idea of String Theory is the quite simple assumption that elementary
particles are not point-like objects but tiny little strings instead.
The string can be defined as a series of maps @xmath from the
world-sheet to space-time, with dynamics governed by an action which is
proportional to the area swept out by the world-sheet as it moves
through space-time. This can be seen more clearly from figure 2.1 .

From the picture, looking first to the point-particle case on the left,
we see the world-line it draws at it goes through space-time is
parametrized by the proper time @xmath . Moving on to the string, we see
that the world-sheet parameters @xmath can be interpreted as the
world-sheet space and time respectively. The classical dynamics of the
string action is governed by the Nambu-Goto action

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath the string tension. The integrand is the infinitesimal
world-sheet area element, therefore its integral is the total area swept
out by the world-sheet. We define also @xmath , the @xmath -dimensional
Minkowskian signature being @xmath and @xmath . Minkowski metric can, of
course, be replaced by a more general @xmath , which would mean the
string is propagating in a curved background. Making the space-time
metric dynamical would however move us to the realm of String Field
Theory, which is beyond the scope of this work. For simplicity we
consider only the flat space case, which is in any case the first term
in a weak field expansion.

The Nambu-Goto action is the simplest and most intuitive string action
one can write, but it is not the best starting point for quantization.
Therefore we replace it by a classically equivalent, more symmetrical
action, the Polyakov action. On a flat @xmath -dimensional Minkowskian
background, the Polyakov action takes the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here @xmath is the metric on the world-sheet and @xmath . (Note that
@xmath is again the area of the world-sheet swept.) Polyakov’s action
has two dynamical variables: the coordinate fields @xmath and the metric
@xmath (which was absent in the Nambu-Goto action). Vanishing of
variations of the action with respect to these variables defines the
equations of motion

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

with @xmath the system’s energy-momentum tensor. Classical equivalence
of Polyakov’s action to the Nambu-Goto one is easily seen by splitting
@xmath into two members, taking determinants on both sides and plugging
the result back into @xmath .

The string dynamics of ( 2.2 ) can be simplified by using the symmetries
available to remove some of the gauge freedom. The symmetries of the
Polyakov action are

-   Poincaré invariance:

      -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.4)
      -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

    with @xmath a Lorentz transformation and @xmath a translation.

-   Reparametrization invariance:

      -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.5)
      -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

-   Conformal invariance:

      -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.6)
      -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

    with @xmath arbitrary.

Poincaré invariance is a global space-time symmetry, reflecting the fact
that it doesn’t matter which space-time reference frame we take.
Reparametrization invariance is the statement of general coordinate
invariance at the world-sheet level. Conformal invariance is a local
scaling symmetry of the world-sheet metric. The world-sheet theory is
thus a conformal field theory (see also chapter 3 ). Conformal symmetry
was not explicitly present in the Nambu-Goto action.

The world-sheet symmetries can now be used to eliminate the degrees of
freedom of @xmath . Heuristically speaking, a general @xmath
-dimensional object is described by a metric which is a @xmath matrix.
The metric is symmetric, so it has @xmath independent components. Each
reparametrization transformation can then be used to eliminate one
further degree of freedom of the metric and conformal scaling can
eliminate one final degree of freedom. In the end we have @xmath
dynamical components left in the world-volume metric of a @xmath
-dimensional object. For @xmath (strings) this is zero and therefore any
world-sheet metric @xmath is essentially equivalent to any other metric
we choose ¹ ¹ 1 This is at genus zero. For higher genera finitely many
moduli will remain. . For our purposes, a convenient choice is @xmath
everywhere, a metric which has indeed zero dynamical components. Note
that for higher dimensional objects like membranes, the world-volume
metric cannot be gauged away to a constant. If the world-volume metric
remains dynamical, the problem becomes much more complicated, already at
the classical level. This is one of the reasons why we only consider
strings, rather than going further into theories of higher-dimensional
fundamental objects like membranes.

Setting the world-sheet metric to @xmath simplifies the Polyakov action
to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

In this gauge the equations of motion become very simple. Setting @xmath
for the open string and @xmath for the closed string, the variation of
the action with respect to @xmath yields

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the surface term is absent for closed strings. For open strings
this surface term can be set to zero if either @xmath or @xmath are zero
(at @xmath ). The motion is then @xmath , subject to the boundary
conditions

  -- -- -------- -- --
        @xmath      
        @xmath      
        @xmath      
  -- -- -------- -- --

The Neumann boundary condition can be interpreted as momentum
conservation at the freely-moving end points of an open string, while
the Dirichlet boundary condition means the open string end points are
kept fixed, attached to something.

The general solution for the wave equations, subject to the boundary
conditions ( 2.1 ) is, (define left- and right-movers @xmath )

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Here we replaced the string tension by the Regge slope parameter, @xmath
. The @xmath are respectively the position and momentum of the string
center-of-mass. The @xmath are Fourier modes, which in the classical
theory are numbers subject to @xmath (because we want @xmath to be
real). In the quantum theory all these quantities get be promoted to
operators. For quantization purposes we write the canonical Poisson
brackets in terms of @xmath and the Fourier modes

  -- -------- -------- -- -- --------
     @xmath                  
     @xmath   @xmath         (2.10)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- --------

with all other Poisson brackets zero.

One must not forget to enforce the equations of motion for the metric,
which are @xmath . This is simply

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is however more convenient to write these constraints in terms of
Fourier modes. For this purpose we define Virasoro operators ² ² 2 These
are conserved charges associated with world-sheet energy-momentum
conservation: @xmath , with @xmath two components of the energy-momentum
tensor written in terms of left- and right-modes.

     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.12)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

These have Poisson brackets

  -- -------- -------- -- -- --------
     @xmath                  
     @xmath   @xmath         (2.13)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- --------

This algebra is the classical Virasoro algebra. The constraint equations
@xmath are then equivalent to vanishing of the components: @xmath . For
the closed string @xmath generates rigid @xmath -translations and must
therefore be identically zero. The case @xmath can be used to express
the string mass in terms of the Fourier modes by means of the mass-shell
condition @xmath ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.14)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

As a curiosity we note that the end points of the Neumann open string
move at the speed of light. The centrifugal force of this motion
compensates the inward-pulling tension and prevents the collapse of the
string to a point. In its turn, the Dirichlet open string solution can
be applied to as many of the space-like directions @xmath as we want.
For each direction with such boundary conditions, @xmath are constants
labeling the precise position of the string end points. These are kept
fixed and the bulk of the string vibrates, much like a guitar string
when fingered.

### 2.2 Light-cone quantization

In this section we review a few basic properties of quantized strings,
which were the original motivation for studying the subject. These
properties are derived via light-cone quantization, a quantization
method does not have manifest space-time Lorentz invariance but will
provide the energy spectrum and an Hilbert space free of negative-norm
states. Lorentz invariance will be imposed ‘by hand’ at the end, and
this requirement will restrict the number of space-time dimensions. In
the next section we present an alternative quantization method based on
path-integrals, which will introduce a few more elements necessary for
the ensuing discussion.

In light-cone quantization we first define light-cone and transverse
coordinates

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

Note that we are treating @xmath in a non-covariant way. In light-cone
coordinates the space-time Minkowskian metric becomes @xmath , so inner
products become @xmath . Now we make a parametrization choice for @xmath
. With this choice everything is fixed and the theory has no more gauge
freedom. We parametrize @xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

This corresponds classically to setting the Fourier modes @xmath for
@xmath . The Virasoro constraints @xmath become

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.17)
  -- -- -- --------

from which we see that by solving the constraints, the @xmath can be
written explicitly in terms of @xmath . With @xmath imposed and @xmath
eliminated, the transverse oscillators @xmath are the only dynamical
variables left.

To quantize, we promote classical quantities to operators and impose
canonical equal- @xmath commutation relations according to the
Heisenberg rule: @xmath . In terms of Fourier components this is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (2.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

with similar commutation relations for the @xmath in the closed string
case. The commutation relations of the Fourier oscillators are similar
to the harmonic oscillator creation/annihilation commutation relation
@xmath , which suggests interpreting the quantized string theory as set
of harmonic oscillators. Therefore @xmath become annihilation operators,
while @xmath are creation operators. The ground state of the quantum
theory is labeled by @xmath , with ‘0’ the excitation level and @xmath
the momentum over the @xmath and transverse directions. A general state
@xmath has then excitation level @xmath and momentum @xmath . The ground
state is defined to be annihilated by the lowering operators @xmath and
to be an eigenstate of the momentum operators

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (2.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

A general state can be built upon the ground state by acting with linear
combinations of creation operators of products of @xmath . From this
point of view, the quantized string resembles a series of overlapping
harmonic oscillators, as we can see from figure 2.2 . For the closed
string we would have the tensor product of two modules: one for the
@xmath and another for the @xmath .

The light-cone Virasoro constraints ( 2.17 ) solve the classical open
string @xmath in terms of bilinear combinations of the @xmath . In the
quantum theory, bilinear operator combinations are replaced
normally-ordered operators. So we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

with a similar expression for the @xmath in the closed string case. The
dots @xmath stand for the usual normal ordering of the
creation/annihilation operators and the factor @xmath accounts for
possible contributions coming from this normal-ordering. (Cf. also (
2.22 )) The light-cone mass-shell condition is @xmath , which yields

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

The operators @xmath are the level number operators, whose eigenvalues
tell us the highest excitation level of a state. For closed strings the
condition @xmath , coming from @xmath , must also be satisfied. Since
the oscillators are integer-moded, each excitation raises the mass by
@xmath ( @xmath for the closed case) and the quantized string spectrum
is thus discrete.

Open string excitations are generated by the transverse @xmath
oscillators. At excitation level zero we have a scalar @xmath of mass
@xmath . At the first excited level we have a vector @xmath . A vector
with @xmath components in a @xmath -dimensional space-time must be
massless, otherwise it would gain a longitudinal component under Lorentz
transformations. The first excited string state has @xmath , so, if
Lorentz invariance is to be preserved, that state must have @xmath ,
which means @xmath . Knowing @xmath , we can calculate @xmath explicitly
from the @xmath normal-ordering formula

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

The infinite sum @xmath is divergent but can be evaluated using Riemann
@xmath -function regularization, yielding

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here is a remarkable result. It seems that quantized string is
Lorentz-invariant only in 26 space-time dimensions. While the
regularization argument may not be totally convincing, the result @xmath
also comes out of other quantization methods, as we will see in the next
section, where we will relate the critical dimension @xmath not to a
space-time symmetry but to a world-sheet one.

The mass of the ground state space-time scalar is now known,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

The negative mass-squared signals a tachyon, an object that moves faster
than light and causes consistency problems at various levels. Later we
will see how tachyons can be removed from the theory. At the first
excited level we have states

  -- -------- -------- -- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath         
     @xmath   @xmath         (2.25)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- --------

The open string state is the aforementioned space-time massless spin-1
vector particle, which can be identified with a photon. The closed
string state can be decomposed in a space-time symmetric traceless
tensor, which can be identified with a graviton; an anti-symmetric
tensor and a scalar trace, called the dilaton

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

The presence of a graviton, a massless spin-2 particle, on the spectrum
of a quantized theory was the original motivation for studying strings.
At higher excitation levels we find all sorts of massive particles,
filling various multiplets of @xmath . All of them turn out to be
bosons, though, so space-time fermions are missing in this simple model.

Naturally, the string model exposed above is still quite far from
reality. Solving the tachyon problem and obtaining space-time fermions
on the spectrum can done by means of introducing world-sheet
supersymmetry. The @xmath problem can be dealt with in two ways, as we
will see below.

#### 2.2.1 Remarks on covariant quantization

Here we review very briefly some aspects of covariant quantization. The
aim is to introduce the quantum Virasoro algebra.

Had we not solved the constraints @xmath at the classical level, and
kept explicit space-time covariance, we would have had to impose extra
conditions on states created by action of a full set of independent
@xmath . If the constraints @xmath are not solved at the classical
level, they would have to be so at the quantum level. In the quantized
theory, these identities are promoted to operator identities acting on
physical states. Solving these identities is crucial to avoid possible
negative-norm states, such as for instance @xmath , which has norm
@xmath . This state was not present in the light-cone formalism because
there only the transverse @xmath oscillators existed.

The quantum Virasoro @xmath operators are defined by normally-ordered
classical expressions

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the normal-ordering constant is again present to account for
ambiguities in defining @xmath . From the commutator @xmath we get the
Virasoro algebra

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath an anomaly term emerging from an eventual normal-ordering
ambiguity. From the Jacobi identity we see that the general form of the
anomaly is @xmath . Acting with the commutator @xmath on the string
ground state with momentum @xmath we can determine @xmath and @xmath ,
obtaining

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is the quantum version of the Virasoro algebra for @xmath
world-sheet scalars @xmath . Note that the anomaly term only appears
because of the normal-ordering ambiguities, which are absent in the
classical case. The presence of an anomaly term signals breakdown of a
classical symmetry at the quantum level; in this case conformal
symmetry. In quantum conformal field theory, the ‘central charge’ number
@xmath appearing in @xmath is one of the parameters characterizing the
theory.

It is precisely because of the anomaly central term in the commutator
@xmath that we see that @xmath , with @xmath a physical state, is only
possible for a subset of the @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is however enough to ensure decoupling of unphysical states,
because, since @xmath and @xmath , then @xmath . Enforcing ( 2.30 )
protects the spectrum from physical negative-norm states if @xmath .
This is the ‘no-ghost theorem’ [ 10 ] . It can be shown that the
spectrum of light-cone quantization is equivalent to the covariant one
by means of this theorem.

#### 2.2.2 Unoriented strings and Chan-Paton factors

The formulation developed for closed and open strings has the discrete
symmetry of world-sheet parity, @xmath . This symmetry interchanges the
left- and right-moving sector of the string and in a geometric
description may also have a non-trivial action in space-time. The
world-sheet effect of @xmath on open strings is @xmath , which acts on
the oscillators as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

and swaps the open strings’ end-points, which can eventually introduce
an extra minus sign. On the closed string, the effect of @xmath is to
change @xmath , which on the oscillators yields

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath is an interchange of sectors, it squares to 1, so its
eigenvalues are @xmath . Now we can construct a new theory, the
unoriented theory, by projecting out of the spectrum states which are
not invariant under the action of @xmath . From the table below, we see
this removes the open string photon and the closed string anti-symmetric
tensor, leaving the tachyons and the graviton and dilaton.

Projecting out the gauge bosons is however not what one wishes to do
from a phenomenological point of view. The gauge theory can however be
restored using the trick of attaching a label, usually called Chan-Paton
factor, to the open string end-points [ 11 ] . Adding these ad hoc
degrees of freedom is compatible with all the symmetries of the string
action and enhances the open string spectrum. The open string states are
then characterized by two extra labels @xmath . The action of @xmath
when Chan-Paton factors are present is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

with the prime on the matrix @xmath reflecting the above mentioned
non-trivial action on the end-points. (It can, for instance, change the
sign of the Moebius strip projection.) Acting with @xmath twice we see
that @xmath can be symmetric or anti-symmetric, leading to @xmath
respectively [ 12 ] . If the number of Chan-Paton factors is @xmath ,
before introducing @xmath there were @xmath photonic states, which
correspond to the degeneracy of states for a gauge group @xmath . For
symmetric/anti-symmetric @xmath only @xmath states survive the @xmath
-projection and the gauge group becomes @xmath or @xmath respectively.

Chan-Paton factors can in this way be used bring back the gauge theory,
giving the unoriented theory a structure similar to the oriented one,
but with different gauge groups and without the anti-symmetric tensor
field from the closed string sector. Unoriented strings introduce
crosscaps on the world-sheet, which can now include surfaces like Klein
bottles and Moebius strips.

### 2.3 Path-integral quantization

The presence of the graviton on the quantized spectrum was original
motivation for studying strings. The motivation for this thesis is in
turn to solve one of the problems that arise in the quantized theory:
@xmath . There is an interesting and elegant way out of the space-time
dimension problem. This solution is not obvious from the previous
quantization methods, but becomes clear when we introduce an alternative
method to quantize strings, path-integral quantization.

The path-integral method is a versatile quantization method,
particularly fit to quantize systems with gauge symmetry, which often
gives insight that is difficult to get otherwise. When applied to
strings, it will introduce the ghost system and with it an idea to deal
with the space-time dimension problem. The derivation of the string
path-integral presented here is simplified. For a more technical
derivation see [ 13 ] .

The idea of a path-integral is to represent transition amplitudes
between states by an integration over all possible classical paths, each
of them exponentially weighted by the corresponding classical Euclidean
action @xmath . This Euclidean path-integral takes the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now, we know that many of the world-sheet metrics @xmath over which we
are integrating are actually physically equivalent because they are
related via reparametrizations and/or conformal transformations.
Therefore the path-integral ( 2.34 ) contains a huge over counting which
must be eliminated if the integral is to make sense.

The modern way to deal with the gauge freedom in path-integrals is via
the Faddeev-Popov procedure. The first step in this procedure is to
choose a reference metric on the world-sheet, say, @xmath . We have seen
that classically all metrics are essentially equivalent to this one. It
is pertinent to ask ourselves whether the same is true in the quantum
case. This is an important point and we will come back to it later. For
the moment let us assume it is always possible to go from any metric
into the reference metric via a combined reparametrization and conformal
transformation. Such a general coordinate transformation @xmath is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

The second step in the Faddeev-Popov method is to write ‘1’ as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the Faddeev-Popov determinant and @xmath is a
gauge-invariant measure, whose specific form will not be needed. The
argument of the delta-function means we used @xmath to bring @xmath into
the reference metric @xmath . The next step is to insert ‘1’ into the
path-integral

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now we can do the @xmath integration. The delta-function requires that
@xmath everywhere, so we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Faddeev-Popov determinant is invariant under gauge transformations
and so is the action @xmath and @xmath , so ( 2.38 ) is actually
independent of @xmath . Being so, we can perform the @xmath integration,
which contributes with an infinite gauge volume factor and drops out as
an overall normalization factor. We are then left with

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

The final step is to rewrite the Faddeev-Popov determinant as a
path-integral over anti-commuting ghost fields @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

Polyakov’s action then becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

The construction of the ghost action @xmath requires careful
differential geometry calculations. In the end it turns out that the
@xmath ghost is an anti-commuting vector field (thus it has one index)
of conformal weight @xmath , whereas the anti-ghost @xmath is a
symmetric traceless tensor (has two indices) of conformal weight @xmath
. Now we pick our reference metric to be the conformal metric @xmath ,
under which the ghost action is, in terms of the world-sheet left- and
right-movers,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

Looking at ( 2.41 ) one sees that path-integral quantization gives a
very interesting insight: getting rid of the gauge freedom in the metric
of the string action is equivalent to choosing a particular gauge and
adding ghost fields to the world-sheet theory. In conformal field theory
language, one says that the world-sheet gauge-fixed theory is the tensor
product of @xmath world-sheet bosons @xmath with the ghost conformal
field theory. It can be shown that ghost system acts in such a way that
the spectrum of the world-sheet theory of ‘bosons plus ghosts’ exactly
matches the spectrum of light-cone and covariant quantization. The
Faddeev-Popov path-integral is therefore an alternative and equivalent
description of the quantized string.

The world-sheet conformal field theory of bosons plus ghosts is worth
exploring. The ghost energy-momentum tensor can be derived as the
variation of the ghost action with respect to the metric (before going
to reference metric, of course). In terms of @xmath it simplifies to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.43)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

with other components vanishing. The equations of motion for the ghosts
are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

The ghosts, being anti-commuting, are canonically quantized by equal-
@xmath anti-commutation relations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (2.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

supplemented by periodicity conditions (closed string) or boundary
conditions (open string). The explicit open string solution is

  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      (2.46)
  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------

which, when inserted in ( 2.45 ) yields

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

For closed strings @xmath and @xmath have independent mode expansions,
which leads to a second set of modes @xmath . The ghost Virasoro
operators for the open string are defined by @xmath at @xmath . Defining
the quantum @xmath ’s by the normal-ordered expressions we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we inserted @xmath as the ghost normal-ordering constant. The
algebra of the @xmath is similar to the one for the bosons, but the
anomaly derived from the Jacobi identity is different and leads to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

We can define a complete world-sheet energy momentum tensor by simply
adding the energy-momentum tensors coming from the @xmath bosons and the
ghost system. This leads to complete quantum Virasoro generators

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

with total conformal anomaly

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

Again, this vanishes for the magical values @xmath . If we incorporate
the normal-ordering factor @xmath into the ghost part, we see that the
ghost system has a central charge @xmath .

We turn now to the remark made in the beginning of this section. As we
see, existence of a conformal anomaly for @xmath signals breakdown of
conformal symmetry at the quantum level. Since reparametrizations can
only bring an arbitrary metric into the form @xmath , conformal
transformations are always necessary to eliminate the exponential
factor. If conformal symmetry is not exact at the quantum level, the
@xmath integration will not decouple. It is only if the total central
charge of the system vanishes that the decoupling of @xmath is valid and
path-integral calculation holds.

#### 2.3.1 Internal theories

The elegance of the Faddeev-Popov method is that it re-expresses the
gauge freedom of the string in terms of a ghost system which contributes
@xmath to the conformal anomaly. This ghost contribution is an
expression of the classical string symmetries and does not change with
the space-time dimension. To cancel the conformal anomaly, one must add
bosons @xmath to the world-sheet theory. Each of them contributes with
@xmath to the total anomaly, and therefore when we add 26 of them the
anomaly vanishes and we are done. But adding a boson @xmath also means
adding a space-time dimension, so when we put in 26 of them, we go to
@xmath .

This leads to the following idea. We are adding free bosons @xmath only.
Couldn’t we add something else instead? The answer is yes. We can, in
fact, tensor the world-sheet bosons and ghosts with whatever conformal
field theory we want, as long as it is unitary, i.e. that it doesn’t
introduce negative-norm states into the theory. The central charge of
each theory adds up and, as long as it adds up to zero, the outcome is
in principle perfectly consistent. The dimensional problem @xmath has
therefore a very simple solution. Find so-called ‘internal’ conformal
field theories @xmath , tensor them with the world-sheet bosons and
ghosts in such a way that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

For instance, we can arrive at our favorite number of space-time
dimensions @xmath by adding four bosons and finding an internal
conformal field theory @xmath such that @xmath . Adding an internal
conformal field theory to the world-sheet produces changes at various
levels, such as the spectrum, transition amplitudes, partition functions
and much more.

#### 2.3.2 Superstrings and compactification

The extra fields added to the world-sheet theory can have non-trivial
space-time interpretation. For instance, we can add fermions with
space-time indexes @xmath to the world-sheet. Historically this was
motivated by the desire to have space-time fermions in the spectrum,
something that could not be achieved with world-sheet bosons @xmath
alone. By inserting world-sheet fermions and requiring a supersymmetric
space-time spectrum [ 14 ] it was also possible to project out the
bothersome tachyonic states. In conformal gauge, the supersymmetric
world-sheet action for @xmath bosons and fermions is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are the usual world-sheet bosons, @xmath a world-sheet
two-component spinor which transforms in the vector representation of
the Lorentz group @xmath and @xmath the two-dimensional gamma matrices.
This action can be quantized by the path-integral method. The
world-sheet supersymmetry also produces changes in the Faddeev-Popov
determinant. As one could expect since the world-sheet theory is
supersymmetric, the @xmath ghosts gain super partners, the @xmath
ghosts, which turn out to contribute +11 to the central charge. Each
fermion contributes @xmath , so in the end we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

from which we get the critical dimension @xmath . This is better than
the purely bosonic @xmath , but still means we need an internal
conformal field theory.

Path-integral quantization is of course but one way to look at the
problem of quantizing strings. After all, in covariant or light-cone
quantization the ghost formalism is not used and therefore sense must be
made of the extra dimensions. The usual way to deal with them is via the
Kaluza-Klein mechanism, or compactification. This amounts to assuming
that the extra dimensions are compact and small enough to be out of
accelerator reach. We then have strings living in the critical
dimension, but with some directions highly curled up.

Compactification is a geometric and intuitive approach to the
dimensional problem, which is why it has become much more popular than
the abstract approach of adding ad hoc degrees of freedom. The two ways
of looking at the problem should in the end be equivalent, although that
remains a conjecture. A formal proof would take a titanic effort, but
some steps towards that end have been taken in simple cases [ 15 ] .
Each method has its advantages and drawbacks. Compactification, while
intuitive, easier to deal with and having all the machinery of
differential geometry to help characterizing the compactification
manifolds, has problems in going beyond simple calculations. It also
feels unnatural to impose a specific geometry on which to quantize
strings, when the strings themselves create geometry. The algebraic
method on the other hand, while being quite abstract and shedding little
light as to what is going on, makes however explicit stringy
calculations feasible.

It is the purpose of this book to deepen the understanding of the
internal conformal field theory by studying examples and checking the
strict consistency requirements they must obey.

## Chapter 3 Conformal Field Theory

We have seen that building a string theory outside the critical
dimension can be done by means of adding an internal conformal field
theory to the world-sheet theory. In order to understand the internal
theory better, we review the key concepts of classical and quantum
conformal field theory.

### 3.1 Classical conformal field theory

Consider classical field theory in @xmath -dimensions, with action

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

This action can have a series of symmetries, each of which gives rise to
a conserved quantity via the Noether theorem. For instance, invariance
under general coordinate transformations @xmath is equivalent to @xmath
, with @xmath a covariant derivative.

Another symmetry the action can have is Weyl invariance, which is
invariance under local re-scalings of the metric; that is,
transformations of the metric of type @xmath . Such symmetry implies a
traceless energy-momentum tensor: @xmath . A conformal transformation is
a coordinate transformation which acts on the metric as a Weyl
transformation. If the action is Weyl-invariant, the action of the
conformal transformation on the metric can be compensated by a Weyl
transformation. The theory is then invariant under conformal
transformations and is said to be a conformal field theory.

Since the string world-sheet is two-dimensional, we concentrate on
two-dimensional conformal field theories from now on. This is most
fortunate since it is precisely in two dimensions that conformal
symmetry is especially powerful. As we have seen from the string,
two-dimensional metrics are essentially trivial, so we take as reference
metric the Euclidean metric ¹ ¹ 1 Going from world-sheet Minkowskian
metric to Euclidean is done to make use of the machinery of complex
analysis. However, one has to make sure the relevant quantities can be
analytically continued to the complex plane. @xmath . In this case, an
infinitesimal coordinate transformation @xmath is conformal if

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

or, going to complex coordinates @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

The global form of such a transformation would be @xmath . The
generators for infinitesimal transformations of a function of @xmath are

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

which satisfy the classical Virasoro algebra

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

In complex coordinates, energy-momentum conservation is simply @xmath .
We see that the energy-momentum tensor has a purely holomorphic and a
purely anti-holomorphic component, respectively @xmath . The
corresponding conserved charges are

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

There is an infinity of conserved charges, since we have one for every
function @xmath that is holomorphic. Conformal symmetry in two
dimensions has then an infinite-dimensional symmetry group.

### 3.2 Quantum conformal field theory

To quantize the conformal field theory we go first to the complex plane
via the conformal transformation @xmath . The closed string Euclidean
theory lives on a cylinder of periodic spatial boundary conditions, so
the world-sheet fields obey @xmath . Upon mapping the cylinder to the
plane, time on the plane flows in circles from the center to the
exterior and spatial integrals become contour integrals around the
origin @xmath . Time-ordering of fields in correlators on the cylinder
becomes radial ordering on the plane. From now on we work on the plane
unless otherwise stated and use @xmath as coordinates on the plane (i.e.
we renamed @xmath back into @xmath ). Conformal field theory on the
plane describes closed strings. To describe open strings we need
conformal field theory on the half-plane, which we review later in
chapter 6 .

Going to the Heisenberg picture we see that the commutator @xmath
generates quantum conformal transformations. In order for the
infinitesimal quantum conformal transformations to be in agreement with
the commutator, the radially-ordered product of the energy-momentum
tensor with @xmath must be

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.7)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

where the dots stand for an analytic power series in @xmath or @xmath .
The numbers @xmath are the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic conformal
weights of @xmath . A conformal field, or primary field is a field which
has an operator product with the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic
components of the energy-momentum tensor of the form ( 3.7 ).

To fully describe a conformal field one has to attach to it a chiral (or
holomorphic) and an anti-chiral (or anti-holomorphic) label, which tells
us in which what representation of the chiral algebra it transforms (see
below). Formulas where two nearby fields are expressed in terms of a sum
of single fields, are called operator products. Attaching the chiral and
anti-chiral labels, operator products take the general form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

The coefficient @xmath is called an operator product coefficient and its
value depends on the details of the theory. The energy-momentum has an
operator product with itself of the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

(and similar for @xmath ). We see the central charge arising in this
operator product. If @xmath , the energy-momentum tensor is a conformal
field of weight 2. The classical @xmath generators become in the quantum
theory modes of the energy-momentum tensor

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

(Remember that the integral over space @xmath becomes in the complex
plane a contour integral around the origin.) Doing the integrals, we see
that the modes @xmath obey the Virasoro algebra

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

Being an algebra, its representations can be studied. Of particular
importance are the irreducible highest-weight representations, which are
annihilated by @xmath . If the number of these representations is
finite, the conformal field theory is said to be rational . An
highest-weight representation can be related to a conformal field @xmath
of weight @xmath ² ² 2 The anti-holomorphic weight can also be
designated by @xmath . via the isomorphism

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the vacuum of the theory, the state with the most
symmetries and therefore the state which is annihilated by the most
@xmath ’s, in this case @xmath . Highest-weight states have eigenvalue
@xmath and upon them a whole representation module (the Verma module)
can be build by acting with @xmath . One can also relate
non-highest-weight states with a field. Such field is called a
descendant field.

The Hilbert space of a conformal field theory is the tensor product of a
holomorphic and an anti-holomorphic chiral algebra

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

For a general state in @xmath , the holomorphic representation need not
coincide with the anti-holomorphic one, which is why the corresponding
primary fields, which are sometimes also called bulk fields, have two
labels instead of just one. This will be made clearer when we study the
partition function of a conformal field theory. The Virasoro algebra is
the simplest example of a chiral algebra.

#### 3.2.1 Extended chiral algebras

It can happen that a conformal field theory has more symmetry than just
the Virasoro algebra. The chiral algebra algebra spanned by the @xmath
modes of the energy-momentum tensor can be enlarged by modes of
holomorphic currents @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

There is, of course, also a commutator @xmath to close the algebra ³ ³ 3
The index @xmath on the current modes need not be integer. , but its
form depends on the explicit form of @xmath . The algebra ( 3.14 ) is an
extended chiral algebra. Extended chiral algebras have in general bigger
Verma modules than unextended ones because to generate a whole
representation we can act not only with the @xmath modes but also with
@xmath . Unextended representations are uniquely determined by the
values of @xmath , but this is not true for extended ones because @xmath
-eigenvalues states may behave differently under @xmath .

In the presence of extended symmetry, the definition of the out-going
state in ( 3.12 ) changes due to non-trivial charge conjugation. It
becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath , where the label @xmath is said to be the charge conjugate
label of @xmath . Labels for which @xmath are called real and those with
@xmath complex. Chiral labels can be lowered and raised with the charge
conjugation matrix @xmath .

#### 3.2.2 Correlation functions on the plane

Correlation or Green’s functions are what one wants to compute in a
quantum field theory. They are transition amplitudes, with which we can
study any scattering process. If the conformal field theory is
formulated on the plane, correlators take the form of an expectation
value

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

Requiring invariance of correlators under infinitesimal transformations
generated by @xmath imposes constraints on their form. Assuming for
simplicity @xmath for primary fields, the two-, three- and four-point
functions take the form ⁴ ⁴ 4 One-point functions vanish due to
translation invariance and zero-point functions are trivial.

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.17)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

with @xmath and @xmath . The two-point function need not be normalized
to unity; a redefinition @xmath may change it ⁵ ⁵ 5 With @xmath real,
otherwise the Hilbert space becomes complex. . By the same token, the
operator product coefficient in the three-point function can be
redefined. Note that both the form of the two- and the three-point
function is completely determined by conformal invariance. The
four-point function is partially determined by it, but a general
dependence on @xmath remains, whose form depends specifically on the
theory at hand.

Correlators involving descendant fields can be derived from correlators
with primary fields by applying differential operators [ 16 ] .

### 3.3 String perturbation theory

Conformal field theory on the complex plane represents but the first
order in string perturbation theory. In field theories like quantum
electrodynamics (or chromodynamics in the high-energy regime), one
calculates a full transition amplitude from an initial state @xmath to a
final state @xmath by summing up over all possible intermediate
processes, each of them represented by a Feynman diagram. In String
Theory we can adopt the same principle, this time replacing the
point-particles’ lines by stringy tubes or strips. The pictorial
representation of these two is shown on figure 3.1 .

The tree-level closed string diagram is topologically equivalent to a
sphere with two insertion points (the initial and final states). This we
can map to the complex plane with two field insertions. The sphere is
the first order diagram in string perturbation theory, so to study the
perturbation series to higher orders one must then study conformal field
theory on more complicated surfaces. The general form of the transition
amplitude for an @xmath -point scattering process would be

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This amplitude for the scattering process reads as follows: it is the
sum over all possible world-sheet topologies @xmath of the path-integral
with @xmath vertex operator insertions integrated over. A vertex
operator @xmath is some combination of primary fields with a physically
meaningful space-time interpretation, which generate the in-going (or
outgoing) strings states. For a closed string scattering process, the
@xmath -point amplitude is the sum over the sphere, the torus, the
two-handled torus, etc. with @xmath vertex operator insertions. If the
sum is to converge, the contributions from the various topologies must
of course decrease as the number of handles increases. If this is the
case, we say we are in the string perturbative regime.

Naturally, this crude form of the transition amplitude again over-counts
configurations and must be made sensible via the Faddeev-Popov
procedure. Each particular topology has its own peculiarities and must
be dealt with separately. For example, we have seen that at the
tree-level every closed string surface regardless of its metric @xmath
could be conformally brought to a sphere and subsequently to a complex
plane. For the torus what happens is that we can conformally bring every
possible closed, oriented genus one surface to a torus with one complex
parameter. Thus, using conformal invariance we avoid having to consider
all the infinity of configurations for @xmath , which is what actually
makes computations possible. This is one of the reasons why quantum
conformal invariance is so crucial in String Theory.

#### 3.3.1 Open and closed surfaces at one-loop

Since we will be interested in open string theories, we will have
unoriented open and closed strings, which requires us to consider
world-sheet surfaces with boundaries and crosscaps. Since this increases
our array of possibile surfaces, we need to keep track of the order in
perturbation theory, and for that we use the Euler number @xmath , whose
exponential is the inverse string coupling [ 17 ] . The Euler number
counts the number of handles, boundaries and crosscaps of the
two-dimensional string world-sheet

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

The first topologies are listed below

The sphere and disk are the surfaces for tree-level scattering of closed
and open strings respectively. Sphere amplitudes are correlation
functions on the plane, which are bilinear combinations of conformal
blocks. Disk amplitudes are correlators on the disk, which are linear
combinations of conformal blocks (see chapter 7 ). The projective plane
is like a sphere with a crosscap and can scatter closed strings, the
amplitudes being also conformal blocks [ 18 ] . At Euler number @xmath
come the first loop diagrams of String Theory, to which we now turn to.

#### 3.3.2 Torus

The torus looks like a cylinder whose ends have been sewn together.
Having no boundaries, this topology arises from closed string loops
only. Any two-dimensional surface with Euler number parameters @xmath
can be deformed to a torus by means of reparametrizations and conformal
transformations.

A torus can be defined as the complex plane modulo a lattice, as shown
in fig. 3.2 .

The complex parameter @xmath is the modulus of the torus. In the same
way one brings the infinity of tree-level closed surfaces to a sphere,
one can also bring the infinity of one-loop closed surfaces to a torus.
The difference is however that while all spheres are conformally
equivalent, the various tori are not - they are distinguished by the
modular parameter @xmath .

The zero-point function on the torus is calculable and has an important
physical interpretation. In quantum mechanics, the Euclidean
path-integral

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath standing for periodic boundary conditions, is the
thermodynamic partition function. For two-dimensional quantum field
theory (like String Theory is) this integral can be generalized.
Imposing periodic boundary conditions not only on the spatial direction
but also on the time direction is equivalent to saying that the fields
of the theory live on the torus, which is precisely the zero-point
function we want. Rescaling @xmath we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath and @xmath the Hamiltonian and total momentum operators on
the cylinder , and the second exponential reflecting the fact that we
can twist the torus in the @xmath -direction before gluing the edges
back together. The operators @xmath and @xmath are [ 19 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

With this we finally get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

The trace is over all states in the Hilbert space, null vectors
excluded. Note also the path-integral is evaluated for a particular
value of the modular parameter @xmath . To get the complete zero-point
function one must in principle integrate over @xmath . For the bosonic
string, which is the space-time part of a more general theory, one has
also to do the integral over the space-time momentum @xmath (which comes
from the contribution of @xmath to @xmath ). With all this, the bosonic
string torus partition function is, for @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

This reads as follows. For each free boson field @xmath , the @xmath
-integration yields a factor @xmath while the oscillators give a
Dedekind @xmath -function. The ghost contribution kills off two
oscillators, @xmath and @xmath , to leave us with the physical
transverse oscillations only and furthermore introduces a factor @xmath
in the integration measure. Then the integration @xmath enforces the
condition @xmath . In the end, the torus degeneracy of states at level
@xmath is @xmath . The total torus is obtained by integrating ( 3.23 )
over @xmath , i.e. @xmath . This leads naively to infinity, but as we
shall see below, this integration has a natural cut-off due to modular
invariance.

When the theory at hand has an internal part, the torus partition
function for the internal sector can be written in terms of primaries
and descendants as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath the character of representation @xmath . Its trace is over
the representation @xmath , modulo null states (zero-norm states), and
can be expanded in terms of @xmath with the expansion coefficient @xmath
counting the internal number of states at each excitation level

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

The matrix @xmath is called the invariant matrix . It tells us how the
holomorphic and anti-holomorphic parts of the chiral algebra combine
into the full conformal field theory.

##### Modular invariance

An interesting feature of the torus is modular invariance. One can check
the transformations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

define the same lattice and thus the same torus. Actually, any
combination of @xmath and @xmath does this, as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

describes the same torus. These transformations generate the group
@xmath and are called modular transformations. The torus partition
function should then reflect this symmetry. The characters @xmath
transform under modular transformations like

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

If the modular matrices @xmath commute with the modular matrix @xmath ,
the theory is invariant under modular transformations and is said to be
modular invariant . It is because of modular invariance that we can
leave out of the integration over @xmath regions that are related to
other via the modular group. Performing the full integration over @xmath
to get the partition function would lead to over-counting and to a
divergent result. This is the above-mentioned natural cut-off of String
Theory that controls the ultraviolet divergences that plague quantum
field theories. For more details see for instance [ 19 ] and references
therein.

##### Fusion rules

The matrix @xmath is symmetric and further satisfies @xmath , @xmath .
It can be also used to define fusion rules via the Verlinde formula [ 20
] . Fusion rules are integer numbers @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

The fusion rules compute couplings. If the chiral algebras @xmath and
@xmath are fully extended, the operator product coefficient @xmath
vanishes if and only if either @xmath or @xmath vanish. This is the
Naturality theorem of [ 21 ] .

There may exist chiral labels @xmath for which the fusion rules contain
only one field on the right-hand-side. E.g. @xmath plus nothing else.
The label @xmath is called a simple current [ 22 ] [ 23 ] . A field
@xmath is called a fixed point of @xmath if @xmath .

#### 3.3.3 Klein bottle

The Klein bottle is a cylinder whose ends have been sewn together but
with opposite orientation. This surface can be drawn by unoriented
closed strings running in a loop in the world-sheet time-like direction.
Surfaces with @xmath can be obtained from the torus by means of
anti-conformal involutions. The Klein bottle for instance be obtained
from the a torus of purely imaginary modulus @xmath via the
identification @xmath , as we can see from fig. 3.3 .

Taking the imaginary direction @xmath as world-sheet time, from the
picture we see that a closed string is propagating in a loop and
returning to itself with opposite orientation.

The Klein bottle partition function can be derived from the torus one by
requiring that is projects out states that are not left invariant under
the world-sheet parity @xmath . At the level of the character this means
that instead of @xmath , we should evaluate @xmath . To achieve the
symmetrization of states at level @xmath we add @xmath and average out
the result:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

For the bosonic string, the Klein bottle partition function that
achieves this is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Klein bottle, like the torus, has one free parameter, but it is
real, not complex. Note that if we do a modular transformation on @xmath
we get the same torus, but this is not true for the Klein bottle. The
@xmath -transformation, for instance, shifts the argument of the @xmath
-function. This means there is no analog of modular transformations for
the Klein bottle.

However, modular transformations still play a role. The @xmath
-transformation, when applied to the Klein bottle interchanges space and
time, but does not change its Teichmueller parameter. This
transformation has a nice interpretation when we look at the picture 3.4
.

In the picture on the right-hand-side space is periodic and time is
cross-identified. The geometric interpretation is then that of a closed
string propagating between two crosscaps.

This transformation of the Klein bottle is called channel transformation
and plays a key role in the construction of unoriented string theories.
In general when one has a @xmath surface defined via an identification
on the torus, a channel transformation is a modular transformation that
does not alter the Teichmueller parameters of the identification. The
channel where world-sheet space is real is the direct channel and the
channel where it can be imaginary is the transverse channel .

#### 3.3.4 Annulus

The annulus is the equivalent of the torus for open strings, in the
sense that it is the oriented one-loop diagram. The anti-conformal
involution defining it is @xmath , which, for a purely imaginary @xmath
leads to the picture 3.5 .

The annulus partition function is similar to the torus, but now using
the open string Hamiltonian on the cylinder, which is just equal to
@xmath . The result is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

For the bosonic string this gives

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

The different argument for the @xmath -function is due to the difference
between the open and closed string excitations (cf. mass-shell condition
[ 17 ] ). Again, in the full partition function, @xmath has to be
integrated over.

The channel transformation of the annulus is again @xmath . Scaling the
annulus picture by @xmath , the transformation leads to the picture 3.6
.

In the direct channel we see an open string running in a loop, whereas
in the transverse channel there is a closed string propagating between
two states, which we call boundary states. Here the reason why there
cannot be an open string theory without closed strings: the channel
transformation entangles the two types of strings.

#### 3.3.5 Moebius strip

Like the Klein bottle, the Moebius strip should symmetrize (or
anti-symmetrize) the open string partition function. The anti-involution
is the same as the annulus but this time @xmath is shifted to @xmath ,
which leads to fig. 3.7 .

For the bosonic string the partition function that accomplishes the
@xmath -projection on the annulus partition function is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

When an internal theory is added, the overall sign of the Moebius strip
is a priori undetermined. It can usually be fixed solving the tadpole
cancellation equations (see section 4.3.9 ). Such equations give a minus
sign for the pure bosonic string and this is what ( 3.34 ) shows, but
can lead to plus signs in other cases.

The channel transformation for the Moebius is slightly different. It is
now @xmath , which leads to picture 3.8 .

In the direct channel we have an open string running in a loop and
coming back to itself with opposite orientation. In the transverse
channel a closed string propagates between a boundary and a crosscap
state, or vice-versa. In the end the open string partition function is
the average @xmath . The full partition functions @xmath have the @xmath
-dependence integrated with measure the same measure as the torus:
@xmath .

Having set the stage to the study of open string theories, we now apply
the machinery to go beyond the bosonic string.

## Chapter 4 Open descendants

If a string theory is built upon an internal conformal field theory, the
internal theory will manifest itself in the string perturbative series.
At the tree level, for instance, vertex operators for transition
amplitudes will decompose into a space-time and an internal part. A
correlator will then split up into the product of a space-time
contribution and an internal part. At the level of one loop and higher,
the principle is the same, but the loop diagrams will put strict
integrality conditions on the internal theory.

In this chapter we construct open descendants, which are open string
theories built out of closed string ones. We will work in a general
setting, the world-sheet theory being a tensor product of free bosons
and an internal sector. We will see the restrictions imposed upon the
internal theory appearing explicitly and interpret them. This would seem
to leave out strings theories with world-sheet supersymmetry, but, by
means of a procedure called ‘bosonic string map’ [ 24 ] , one can map
the partition function of a superstring theory into that of a bosonic
one. In this way, all the superstring partition function calculations
can be carried out more easily by studying its faithful bosonic map. The
results of this chapter can therefore be straightforwardly extended to
the superstring case.

### 4.1 Construction of the unoriented theory

In a string model, one of the first things one would like to know is its
spectrum and the simplest transition amplitudes. After that, one can ask
whether the theory is consistent at higher amplitudes. (In this thesis
we take a top-to-bottom approach. The spectrum is derived by looking at
the one-loop partition functions and the simple transition amplitudes
are studied when checking for consistency at higher orders.) Our
construction of open string theories will revolve around the one-loop
vacuum diagrams, which will introduce a series of concepts and a few
very simple consistency requirements which are nevertheless restrictive
enough to help classifying the internal theories themselves.

#### 4.1.1 General torus

The torus for a general string theory, involving a space-time part and
internal sectors, can be evaluated straight away, using considerations
from the previous chapter. We get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

The @xmath -integration is done here over the real and imaginary parts
of @xmath , restricted to a fundamental region @xmath to take modular
invariance into account. The contribution from the internal sector is
summarized in @xmath . The torus ( 4.1 ) has the explicit form of the
tensor product of a bosonic partition function times an internal theory
partition function

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

One can check that ( 4.1 ) is explicitly modular invariant if the
invariant matrix from the internal sector satisfies @xmath .

The internal partition function @xmath can be evaluated once we know the
world-sheet spectrum of the internal theory (which is not the space-time
one). The space-time contribution for the Klein bottle, Annulus and
Moebius strip is then simply the one evaluated in the previous chapter.
The internal contribution is however not directly calculable. Indeed,
for instance, finding a Klein bottle projection that leaves out
unoriented states of @xmath and the associated annulus and Moebius strip
is the problem to be solved.

#### 4.1.2 Transverse channels for Klein bottle, Annulus and Moebius
strip

Deriving general expressions for the internal sectors’ Klein bottle,
annulus and Moebius strip is more easily solved in the transverse
channel description. In this channel, the @xmath surfaces are seen as
closed string transition amplitudes between boundary and crosscap states

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with @xmath and @xmath a boundary and crosscap state respectively. So,
in terms of pictures, a closed string state emerges from a boundary or
crosscap state, propagates for a time @xmath and disappears into a
boundary or crosscap again. This is a tree-level amplitude, so it is a
correlator between two special states. The first thing to do is then to
find out what are these states.

##### Gluing conditions

If one looks at the transverse channel annulus picture, where a closed
string is propagating between two boundaries, and changes the
world-sheet space and time direction, one gets an open string running in
a loop with end points attached to a hyper-surface - a D-brane. From the
point of view of the open string, in the Neumann directions momentum
should not flow from the open string to the hyper-surface. Now, in the
same way a closed string can be mapped to the complex plane, the open
string with boundary conditions @xmath and @xmath can be mapped via
@xmath to a complex half-plane, with the boundary condition @xmath
imposed along the real line @xmath and @xmath along @xmath (see chapter
6 ). When this mapping is done, the no-flow condition implies [ 25 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

at the end points of the open string. The change in boundary conditions
is mediated by a boundary field at @xmath . It is only the Virasoro
algebra which must be preserved at the boundary. If the chiral algebra
is extended, the extra symmetries need not be preserved there. It can,
of course, still happen that they are preserved, but it can also happen
that they are preserved only up to an automorphism, or that they are not
be preserved at all. The two latter cases are often referred to as
‘symmetry-breaking boundaries’. In the case that the extra symmetries
are preserved up to an automorphism we have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

at the end points of the open string, with @xmath an automorphism of the
chiral algebra. This was the case in [ 26 ] [ 27 ] . Some cases where
the extended symmetries are not preserved at all were studied in [ 28 ]
and [ 29 ] .

Considering ( 4.3 ) and ( 4.4 ), imposing the no-flow conditions on the
plane and interchanging the interpretation of world-sheet time and space
again brings us back to the closed string picture. This can be done in a
series of moves. Define the cylinder in the half-plane by @xmath . Now
swap @xmath , rescale by @xmath and finally use the conformal map @xmath
. This is summarized in fig. 4.1 .

The cylinder is thus brought to an annulus on the full complex @xmath
-plane. Time in the full plane runs radially, so we see a closed string
emerging from a boundary state at radius @xmath , propagating and
disappearing into another boundary or crosscap at @xmath . In the case
of a crosscap, the calculation involves the crosscap identification
@xmath , and is in the rest similar. The quantized no-flow conditions in
the complex plane become operator equations on the boundary and crosscap
states

  -- -------- -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      (4.5)
  -- -------- -- -------- -- -------

In the following, we write the conditions for @xmath ’s only, since the
@xmath ’s are just a subset thereof. The space-time free bosons @xmath
have a symmetry current @xmath , with real modes @xmath (see chapter 5
), and the automorphism @xmath has two solutions: @xmath , corresponding
to Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions respectively [ 30 ] . In
this thesis we will consider only the trivial automorphism for the
internal conformal field theory.

##### Ishibashi states

The closed strings states that solve the gluing conditions are the
so-called Ishibashi states [ 31 ] . For trivial automorphism, the
boundary and crosscap Ishibashi states are

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

The sums are over the whole chiral algebra representation @xmath . The
operator @xmath is an anti-unitary operator satisfying the commutation
relation @xmath . Using this commutator, the hermiticity condition
@xmath and the fact that the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic matrix
elements @xmath are equal, we can show that ( 4.6 ) is indeed a solution
to the gluing conditions ( 4.5 ). From the definition, we see that there
exists an Ishibashi state whenever a representation is allowed to couple
to its charge conjugate in the anti-holomorphic sector. Whether or not
this happens can be seen from the torus modular matrix @xmath , so have
thus @xmath Ishibashi states = @xmath .

Ishibashi states actually do not belong to the physical Hilbert space
because the sum over the whole representation gives them an infinite
norm. (For the bosonic string they are coherent states.) But this is not
a problem since their explicit form is not needed. What will be needed
instead are the inner products

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (4.7)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- -------

where we recall @xmath . For each Ishibashi state a transverse field
propagates in the closed string channel. From now on we label transverse
fields by @xmath and chiral fields by @xmath . Later on, boundary
conditions will be labeled @xmath .

#### 4.1.3 Boundary and crosscap states

The general solution for the gluing conditions ( 4.5 ) is a linear
combination of Ishibashi states. A boundary and crosscap state would
then be

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath are the boundary coefficients and @xmath the crosscap
coefficients. These coefficients measure the strength of the interaction
of the conformal field @xmath with the boundary or crosscap state
respectively. The dual boundary and crosscap states are defined by the
bras @xmath . The boundary conditions @xmath can be interpreted
geometrically as D-brane positions in the compact space.

With the boundary and crosscap states defined, we can finally evaluate
the internal transverse channel amplitudes for the Klein bottle, annulus
and Moebius strip. Before we do that, we introduce Chan-Paton factors
@xmath that count the number of times a D-brane of type @xmath appears
in the theory. A boundary state @xmath then contributes @xmath times to
the annulus or Moebius strip. One could in principle define a similar
multiplicity for the crosscap, but in practice it seems only one type of
crosscap is allowed in a string theory. Such a crosscap multiplicity
would also spoil closed string integrality and for these two reasons we
will only consider one type of crosscap state. With Chan-Paton factors
the transverse channel amplitudes are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.9)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

We have put tildes in @xmath to denote they were computed in the
transverse channel.

#### 4.1.4 General Klein bottle, annulus and Moebius strip

We can now apply the channel transformations to get the final form of
the Klein bottle, annulus and Moebius strip amplitudes. We have seen in
chapter 3 that the channel transformation is @xmath for the Klein bottle
and annulus and @xmath for the Moebius strip. Let us take the Klein
bottle first. We rescale the integration variable as @xmath and do an
@xmath -transformation on @xmath . This gives

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now we do another change of variables @xmath , so that we get the same
character argument as the space-time @xmath -function. We get, in the
new variable,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

And this is the form of the Klein bottle in the direct channel. A
similar calculation for the annulus gives

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

This time we used @xmath to get the same internal character argument as
the space-time part. For the Moebius strip one has first to extract the
phase from the hatted character, then perform the channel transformation
@xmath , and finally reinsert the phase into the hatted character. In
the end we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath . Note that the direct channel internal quantities have the
same integration measure as the space-time part. This is required for
the integrations over the modular parameters to have a sensible
interpretation.

### 4.2 The spectrum

Having transformed the internal sector transverse channel amplitudes to
the direct channel, we can now check the spectrum of the full theory.
The correct space-time contribution [ 32 ] must be tensored with the
internal sector. When all this is done and normalizations are fixed, the
direct channels of the full theory are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.14)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where we defined the Klein bottle, annulus and Moebius strip
coefficients

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

These quantities can, as we will now see, be interpreted as spectrum
degeneracies and should therefore obey certain positivity and
integrality conditions.

Recall the quantities. The space-time dimension, or number of free
bosons @xmath , is @xmath with @xmath the number of light-cone
dimensions. The torus integration is over a fundamental region @xmath to
account for modular invariance. The symmetric matrix @xmath has integer
entries, with @xmath running through the set of irreducible
representations of the chiral algebra of the internal theory. The
coefficients @xmath are the Klein bottle, annulus and Moebius strip
coefficients of the internal sector.

#### 4.2.1 Closed spectrum

The projection @xmath gives us the spectrum of the closed sector. For
this purpose it will be useful to merge the space-time and internal
characters’ trace expansions, so we define ‘full’ characters as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath meaning the degeneracy of the full character at excitation
level @xmath . Already here we find something interesting. The exponent
of @xmath is the mass-squared of a particular state. We thus see that
for internal conformal weights between 0 and 1, extra tachyonic states
appear. Since these have no space-time excitations, they are scalars. If
the internal weights are above one, we have massive space-time scalars.
In space-time supersymmetric theories, the array of extra tachyonic
states is projected out because they are not space-time supersymmetric
states.

Having written ( 4.16 ), the expressions for the torus and direct
channel Klein bottle can now be added. We get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (4.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now we perform the integration over @xmath . Take the diagonal part
@xmath first. When @xmath the @xmath -integration forces @xmath and we
get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since the result is an unoriented partition function, the quantity
between brackets represents the total unoriented degeneracy at level
@xmath , so it must be an integer number. This can be achieved if the
torus and Klein bottle coefficients obey

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is our first integrality constraint. It may not the only way to
obtain an integral spectrum; a given internal theory may well have
@xmath ’s such that integrality is respected even if ( 4.19 ) does not
hold. However, ( 4.19 ) is the only way to get integers at all
excitation levels, that also leads to a sensible interpretation of the
multiplicities in terms of chiral algebra representations.

Note that we have used all the Klein bottle coefficients to define (
4.18 ), so for the case @xmath there will be only contributions from the
torus. For the special case of the identity character, @xmath , at
excitation level @xmath we have the degeneracies for the graviton and
dilaton. In this case @xmath , otherwise we would have multiple
gravitons and dilatons. This means @xmath . From the purely conformal
field theory point of view, @xmath is the condition for a unique vacuum,
which we naturally want. Then @xmath otherwise we have no vacuum.

In the case @xmath the @xmath -integration enforces @xmath and we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath . Again the quantity between brackets should be an integer,
and it is so when @xmath is symmetric. Non-symmetric @xmath appear in
heterotic theories, where the left and right chiral algebras are
different, but we do not consider these theories. Also, since the
world-sheet parity operator @xmath interchanges the left and right
Hilbert spaces, the assumption that a conformal field theory should
allow for crosscaps only makes sense if the modular invariant is
symmetric.

##### Open spectrum

The annulus and Moebius strip add up to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (4.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

This requires that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

The correct interpretation of this result requires however further
discussion.

### 4.3 Orientation matters

In this section we construct and analyze the unoriented annulus. This
will enable us to write down the unoriented open string partition
function and to present a set of requirements that supplement positivity
and integrality of the partition functions as a guideline for
constructing unoriented theories.

#### 4.3.1 Oriented versus unoriented annuli

The annulus amplitude @xmath is an oriented amplitude, since it is a
scattering from brane @xmath to brane @xmath . In the unoriented theory
the @xmath -projection swaps end-points, so the unoriented set of
annulus coefficients should be symmetric in @xmath .

From the conformal field theory point of view, the different boundary
labels @xmath mean different conformally invariant boundary conditions.
From the geometrical point of view, the different labels correspond to
D-branes at different locations inside the compactification manifold. In
an unoriented theory, orientifold O-planes are added to the picture.
These planes introduce mirror (image) branes, with labels @xmath , as
can be seen from fig. 4.2 .

Depending on the specific model at hand, the mirror branes may or may
not coincide with the branes themselves (see for instance the O0 and O2
orientifolds of [ 33 ] ). When the mirror image is the brane itself we
have @xmath , and when the image is a different brane we have @xmath .
Without O-planes, a stack of @xmath D-branes gives rise to a @xmath
Chan-Paton gauge group [ 12 ] . When an O-plane is added to the picture,
branes that are mapped into themselves give rise to @xmath and @xmath
gauge groups, whereas strings that stretch between a brane @xmath and
its mirror image @xmath give rise to @xmath groups.

This suggests that the partition function @xmath should describe the
scattering of strings from a brane to the orientifold reflection of
another brane. That requires us to write down an annulus for this case,
symmetric in the boundary indices, which we designate by @xmath . This
annulus coefficient is the natural coefficient for the unoriented
string.

We can construct @xmath in the following way. The world-sheet parity
operator @xmath interchanges the left and right Hilbert spaces and may
further have some involutive action on the representations themselves,
hence the superscript on @xmath , referring to the possible different
actions of @xmath on these representations. The action of @xmath on
boundary Ishibashi states is ¹ ¹ 1 In general, the Ishibashi states can
be degenerate, in which case the @xmath become matrices [ 29 ] . Here
that does not happen because we will be considering automorphism
invariants only.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is an eigenvalue and the hermiticity condition comes from
the fact that @xmath is a unitary involution. The transverse channel
computation of @xmath and transformation to the direct channel yields
simply

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

One can easily check that this expression is symmetric in @xmath and
@xmath , although not explicitly. To reach explicit symmetry we need a
relation like

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath , which relates the emission of a closed string state to the
absorption of its charge conjugate state. Such relation should hold due
to CPT invariance (invariance under combined conjugation, parity and
time-reversal). This leads to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

an annulus coefficient which is now manifestly symmetric in the boundary
indices @xmath and can, as we will see, be related to the oriented one.
Before we relate the two annuli, let us explore some of the properties
of @xmath

#### 4.3.2 NIMreps and completeness conditions

Positivity and integrality of the one-loop partition functions and
modular invariance are simple consistency checks of a conformal field
theory. It was argued in [ 34 ] that completeness of boundaries could be
taken as an additional consistency requirement. Completeness means there
should exist a boundary projection operator such that @xmath . Following
[ 35 ] this requirement can be put into the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

This equation defines a non-negative integer matrix representation of
the fusion algebra or ‘NIMrep’. If one knows the internal theory’s
@xmath -matrix, one also knows the fusion rules and consequently the
oriented annulus coefficients can be determined by solving ( 4.27 ),
which can be done either analytically or numerically. From the oriented
annulus one can then determine the boundary coefficients up to a phase.
Solving ( 4.27 ) is therefore a possible starting point for the open
descendants construction.

Let us now define ‘reflection coefficient’ as @xmath . In order for the
oriented annulus to give rise to @xmath Chan-Paton gauge groups we need
@xmath . With this and ( 4.27 ) we can derive [ 36 ] [ 37 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

Equation ( 4.28 ) is actually equivalent to ( 4.27 ), as was proved in [
38 ] . The point here is that completeness implies that @xmath is
invertible, which means that the number of different conformally
invariant boundary conditions is equal to the number of Ishibashi
states. This claim has been proven in [ 39 ] .

When searching for NIMreps, we can find zero, one or more than one
solutions. If no solution exists, the conformal field theory at hand
cannot be formulated in surfaces with boundaries, which is deemed as a
sign of inconsistency. Modular invariants of automorphism type (see
section 4.4 ) are expected to yield only one NIMrep, and this will be
indeed the case in the example of chapter 5 . Multiple NIMreps are
typically present in cases with @xmath . In the following we assume the
NIMrep to be unique. After having found a NIMrep, we can construct
@xmath as follows.

#### 4.3.3 S-NIMreps and boundary conjugation

The unoriented annulus coefficient @xmath can be related to the oriented
one @xmath by means of @xmath . This particular unoriented annulus
coefficient can be used to raise and lower boundary indices

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is simple to see that the right-hand-side does indeed satisfy ( 4.27
) if completeness holds. Remember that the set of coefficients @xmath is
in principle not unique - there may exist various sets of @xmath that
lead to the same @xmath . Each set of different @xmath is a therefore a
different symmetrization of @xmath and we refer to it as an S-NIMrep.
Using ( 4.15 ) and ( 4.29 ) one can also show [ 29 ] that a set of
@xmath can always be cast into the form ( 4.26 ).

To get sensible gauge groups like @xmath , @xmath or @xmath , the
coefficient @xmath must be an involution, i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

The matrix @xmath acts then as a boundary conjugation matrix. We now
have two ways to arrive at an S-NIMrep. We can either:

-   Compute @xmath and transform to the open string channel, or

-   Compute @xmath and symmetrize the result using @xmath .

Comparing both results we see that the effect of @xmath on a boundary
state is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

As expected, it maps a boundary state into its conjugate, in accordance
with the geometrical picture of fig. 4.2 .

#### 4.3.4 Crosscaps

The argument above requires us to evaluate Klein bottle and Moebius
strip amplitudes with an insertion of @xmath too: @xmath , @xmath .
Since the crosscap corresponds to an orientifold plane, we expect the
crosscap state to be an eigenstate of @xmath and a fixed point, i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

To determine which sign is the correct one, we note that @xmath always
acts on the boundary states with a plus sign, so we expect the same to
happen for the crosscap state. Furthermore, the minus sign would imply
@xmath , which would violate spectrum integrality for @xmath if the
boundary is self-conjugate (see below). For these reasons we take the
plus sign to be the correct one.

If @xmath , we can derive @xmath . This, together with the assumption
that the crosscap Ishibashi state also satisfies the CPT relation ( 4.25
), when applied to the transverse channel expressions with @xmath ,
leads to ² ² 2 The Klein bottle and Moebius coefficients should also
have an @xmath label attached: @xmath , @xmath , but we drop it to
simplify the notation.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

An additional condition that can be used to determine whether or not a
given symmetrization matrix @xmath has an underlying orientifold
symmetry is the following. Using the crosscap CPT formula and some
algebra we can derive @xmath , which is interpreted as follows. An
arbitrary symmetrization matrix @xmath always lead to an annulus of the
form @xmath . If we now write @xmath we come to the correct expression
for the unoriented annulus, but nothing guarantees us that the @xmath
obtained this way is a symmetry of the theory. In order to be a
symmetry, the condition @xmath must be satisfied. If it’s not satisfied,
then @xmath cannot be a symmetry. This issue has been studied in detail
in [ 40 ] .

One final consistency check is to verify that the channel
transformations give vanishing boundary and crosscap coefficients on
non-Ishibashi states. Remember that Ishibashi states only exist for
chiral fields that couple to their charge conjugate in the torus, so if
@xmath , we should have @xmath . For boundary coefficients the
completeness hypothesis that @xmath is invertible implies vanishing of
@xmath for @xmath not Ishibashi. For the crosscap coefficients, this can
be done writing @xmath . Then, using ( 4.41 ) we can derive @xmath ,
with @xmath still undetermined. Substituting this into ( 4.42 ) shows
that the Klein bottle must be of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

Defining now @xmath gives us back @xmath and @xmath . Now note that due
to @xmath vanishing on non-Ishibashi labels, @xmath can be chosen to
vanish on those labels too without any loss of generality. This proves
the sum over @xmath on ( 4.34 ) can be carried out through Ishibashi
labels only.

#### 4.3.5 Open spectrum

We can now analyze the open string spectrum. Assuming @xmath (which is
reasonable if we look at picture 4.2 ), equation ( 4.22 ) should then be
integer whatever the set of Chan-Paton factors @xmath is. Then we can
replace the summation in @xmath for a summation in @xmath and use @xmath
to write ( 4.22 ) as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

For self-conjugate boundaries @xmath we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

The number inside brackets times @xmath can be interpreted as the total
open string state degeneracy at excitation level @xmath and should
therefore be an integer. That will be so if we require the integrality
condition

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

From the identity character @xmath we get the gauge group. At the first
excitation level @xmath , the state is massless and the degeneracy
coming from the space-time transverse excitations endows it with a
space-time index @xmath , making it a vector boson. Then the internal
sector generates @xmath copies of this boson. Since @xmath , the total
number of vector bosons coming from self-conjugate boundaries is @xmath
, hinting at a gauge group @xmath or @xmath , depending on the overall
sign of the Moebius strip. For @xmath , in the simple case where the
annulus and Moebius coefficients are @xmath , we get scalars in the
adjoint of @xmath . For more general annulus and Moebius coefficients
there can be ambiguities in interpreting the counting of states, but we
expect in general only one interpretation to give sensible
representations. From the above it is also explicitly clear that the
minus sign in ( 4.32 ) would lead to non-integer multiplicities.

For non-self-conjugate boundaries @xmath we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.38)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- --------

We get again positive integer degeneracies if

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

For @xmath we get, since @xmath , @xmath vector bosons, which hints at
@xmath gauge group. For @xmath and annuli and Moebius coefficients equal
to 1, the degeneracy at level zero is @xmath , which are space-time
scalars respectively in the symmetric tensor, in the conjugate symmetric
tensor and in the adjoint representations of @xmath . Again, for more
general annulus and Moebius coefficients, we expect only one sensible
interpretation to the degeneracy.

For the non-diagonal annulus case we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

Positivity and integrality is guaranteed from ( 4.27 ) and from the
symmetry of @xmath in the boundary indices.

#### 4.3.6 U-NIMreps

We have seen that the condition @xmath is the correct integrality
condition for the unoriented open string. With this we can define a
U-NIMrep as an S-NIMrep which further has Klein bottle and Moebius
strips coefficients satisfying @xmath and @xmath and the polynomial
equations of [ 37 ] [ 40 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.41)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.42)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

with @xmath an integer, defined by [ 41 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

These polynomial equations can be derived from ( 4.28 ) and can be used
to determine the Klein bottle and Moebius coefficients numerically.
U-NIMreps can only be defined if the invariant matrix @xmath is
symmetric.

#### 4.3.7 Summary of consistency conditions

We can now enumerate the set of consistency conditions the open
descendant construction should have. The unoriented string theory
descending from a closed oriented string theory based on an internal
conformal field theory that has a symmetric modular invariant torus
partition function should also be consistent on surfaces with boundaries
and crosscaps. For that we require:

1.  Existence of a NIMrep, i.e. a set of non-negative integers @xmath
    satisfying ( 4.27 );

2.  Existence of an S-NIMrep, i.e. at least one boundary conjugation
    matrix @xmath such that @xmath is symmetric in the boundary indices;

3.  Existence of a U-NIMrep, i.e. a set of Klein bottle and Moebius
    strip coefficients @xmath , such that @xmath and @xmath are
    non-negative integers with @xmath and @xmath , and that ( 4.41 -
    4.42 ) hold.

This is a set of world-sheet consistency requirements based on
positivity and integrality requirements of the one-loop partition
functions. In section 6 we discuss more general conditions that can be
used to prove consistency to all orders in perturbation theory, not only
at the one-loop level.

Note that if one cannot find an S- or U-NIMrep for a given NIMrep, this
would mean that even though the conformal field theory can in principle
³ ³ 3 A NIMrep is a necessary but not sufficient condition for
consistency on surfaces with boundaries. be consistently defined on all
oriented surfaces, it is inconsistent in the presence of crosscaps. In
the same way one argues that a conformal field theory is inconsistent if
it cannot be defined on surfaces with boundaries, one can conjecture
that a conformal field theory is again inconsistent if cannot be defined
on surfaces with crosscaps. Again, the conjecture that existence of a
U-NIMrep is necessary for a conformal field theory to be consistent only
makes sense if @xmath is symmetric.

#### 4.3.8 Boundaries and crosscaps from integral data

Solving ( 4.27 ) yields the oriented annulus coefficients. This gives us
the boundary coefficients @xmath up to a phase. Next, by finding a
symmetrization matrix @xmath one reaches the unoriented annulus
coefficients, which determine @xmath up to a sign, provided we know
@xmath . These eigenvalues are in general difficult to find, but if we
look at the unoriented annulus coefficients

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

we see that we can absorb a factor @xmath into @xmath and with that
define a new boundary coefficient @xmath , which can now be determined
from ( 4.44 ) up to an overall @xmath -dependent sign. Getting this new
boundary coefficient @xmath is much easier than trying to find explicit
solutions to @xmath that are consistent. (In [ 27 ] , [ 42 ] and [ 43 ]
this was implicitly done.) At the level of the one-loop partition
functions, determining one boundary coefficient or the other is, of
course, the same.

The crosscap coefficient can also be recast into the form @xmath , so
that we remove @xmath from the problem at the level of partition
functions. From ( 4.33 ) we can get @xmath , again up to an overall
sign. If we consider @xmath and @xmath , the positivity and integrality
problem is invariant under @xmath .

##### Classifying algebra

Telling what @xmath is exactly can in principle be done because the
boundary coefficients are expected to form a representation of the
‘classifying algebra’ [ 44 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is sensitive to the phase/sign changes and should thus determine
@xmath exactly. Knowing the structure constants @xmath would enable us
to find also @xmath and @xmath , but unfortunately these constants are
expressed in terms of model-dependent data like operator product
coefficients and fusing matrices.

So, at this point we cannot do better than considering the boundary and
crosscap coefficients @xmath and @xmath when trying to find solutions
for the positivity and integrality constraints. Accordingly, in the
explicit solutions presented below, the boundary and crosscap
coefficients are @xmath and @xmath . However, in order to keep the
notation simple, we will drop the primes from @xmath and @xmath .

##### Methods for constructing open descendants

Starting from a modular invariant torus one can construct its open
descendants by finding its S- and U-NIMreps. This can be done either
from first principles or by letting a computer program solve the
positivity and integrality constraints numerically. One approach is, for
instance, to postulate boundary and crosscap coefficients and verify
they lead to Klein bottle, annulus and Moebius coefficients satisfying
the positivity and integrality requirements of section 4.3.7 . This is a
good approach if the case at hand has some underlying symmetry which
allows an educated guess at the boundary and crosscap coefficients.

An alternative way is to search for solutions to the NIMrep equation
(either analytically or numerically), finding a boundary conjugation
matrix and then solve the polynomial equations to find a Klein bottle
and Moebius strip consistent with the positivity and integrality
requirements. This method can be used in cases where there are no clues
as to what the boundary and crosscap coefficients look like.

#### 4.3.9 Other consistency requirements

The set of consistency requirements of the previous section are
essential to have a sensible unoriented string theory. In this section
we discuss other conjectured consistency conditions (also at the
one-loop level) that are at the moment on less solid grounds than the
ones above.

Amongst these are reality of the crosscap coefficients @xmath [ 45 ] and
the (yet unproved) trace formula of [ 37 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

There is not much to say here, except that all consistent models known
so far obey these two conditions, whereas many models that are
inconsistent at other levels also fail to fulfill these two conditions.

We turn now to a condition not yet well understood, but which seems to
play an important role nonetheless.

##### Klein bottle constraint

Since @xmath is a symmetry of the theory, it must respect the bulk
interactions and operator products [ 12 ] . Therefore its eigenvalues
should be conserved in fusion: @xmath if @xmath . In the spectrum of
closed strings the projection is implemented by the Klein bottle, so
this suggests that [ 42 ] [ 46 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Klein bottle projection should thus be preserved in fusion. But this
is known to be violated in some otherwise consistent cases [ 43 ] .
However, violations only occur in cases where @xmath and even. Since two
(or any even number of) anti-symmetrized representations can combine
into a symmetrized one, it is not clear if these violations should be
regarded as an inconsistency. What seems to be clear is that violations
when @xmath is an odd number do lead to inconsistencies at various
levels, so we will take that as a clear sign of trouble. It has been
argued in [ 47 ] that cases involving simple currents like those of [ 43
] the fusion rules which lead to violations of the Klein bottle
constraint are always even.

In [ 29 ] further examples were explored that violated the Klein bottle
constraint. Some of these, like for instance automorphism invariants of
@xmath , also violated other requirements and could be discarded, but in
the case of extension invariants of Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models [ 48
] , the extended theory fulfilled the Klein bottle constraint, whereas
one of the U-NIMreps of the unextended theory violated it.

It is thus clear that Klein bottle constraint is still not well
understood and a more rigorous formulation of it is necessary.

##### Tadpole cancellation

This consistency condition is well understood, but it is more of a
space-time requirement. In particular, it allows us to determine the
Chan-Paton factors @xmath .

The tadpole cancellation conditions see that the whole theory is
divergence-free at one-loop. Recall that the integrations over the
modular parameters for the Klein bottle, annulus and Moebius strip go
all the way to infinity, thus potentially leading to divergences. The
sum @xmath leads, in the transverse channel, to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the factor @xmath comes from the space-time contribution to the
transverse channel and @xmath a relative sign between @xmath and @xmath
, which fixes the Moebius projection. The tachyonic terms @xmath are
highly divergent, but can be regularized by analytic continuation using
@xmath and are anyway expected to disappear in supersymmetric theories.
The divergences coming from the mode excitations @xmath and internal
fields @xmath cannot be regularized since the analytic continuation
gives @xmath , therefore one must require that for field with @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

which can be solved for integer Chan-Paton factors.

The boundary and crosscap coefficients are in general irrational
numbers, so one would normally expect no solutions to the Diophantine
equation ( 4.49 ). However, in practice solutions seem to be
embarrassingly abundant. A thorough study remains to be done to answer
why this is so. Some steps in that direction have been taken in [ 49 ] .

It should be noticed that some of the massless tadpole divergences are
not necessarily fatal [ 50 ] . Tadpoles of physical fields can be dealt
with by shifting the vacuum into a stable background. Tadpoles of
unphysical fields cannot couple to a background and therefore must be
eliminated. Unphysical fields are those that have been projected out by
the Klein bottle or Moebius strip. In space-time supersymmetric theories
there are tadpoles coming from the NS-NS sector (Neveu-Schwarz) and
tadpoles coming from R-R sector (Ramond). Depending on the Klein bottle
projection, one of them is physical and the other unphysical. However,
in these theories, both tadpoles come from the same supersymmetry
multiplet, so, if we cancel one of the tadpoles, the other is
automatically canceled as well.

Tadpole cancellation is, in a way, the analog of modular invariance for
open string theory. It is an important tool that not only determines the
final space-time spectrum but also guarantees it will be free of gauge
and gravitational anomalies in the low-energy effective action [ 50 ] [
51 ] , just like modular invariance does for closed strings [ 52 ] .

When a string theory has D-branes that are space-time filling (i.e. that
fill out all the non-compact dimensions), there will be tadpoles, whose
cancellation requires introduction of O-planes. If the theory has
D-branes that are not space-time filling, like the type IIA superstring,
it can be tadpole free because the solitonic D-brane solutions are
localized solutions to the equations of motion and these do not generate
tadpoles. One can think of this in terms of R-R flux cancellation: the
flux coming from non space-time filling branes can escape to infinity
via the non-compact directions orthogonal to the D-brane. But if the
brane is space-time filling, all these directions are taken. Then the
flux has no where to go and must therefore annihilate on a source of
negative R-R charge, the O-plane.

### 4.4 Solutions to the integrality constraints

The first step in the construction of open descendants is a left-right
symmetric torus modular invariant partition function. The torus provides
the operator spectrum, which tells us how the representations of the
chiral algebra combine into a full conformal field theory. Furthermore,
it is the object where the unoriented Klein bottle projection acts. A
short list of modular invariants types is therefore in order.

#### 4.4.1 Modular invariant types

##### Automorphism invariants

These invariants are characterized by a torus of the form @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

To satisfy @xmath -invariance, the permutation of the chiral labels must
be such that @xmath . Any conformal field theory with a maximally
extended symmetry algebra will necessarily be of automorphism kind [ 21
] .

An important kind of automorphism invariant is the C-diagonal, or Cardy
invariant, which has @xmath . This was the first invariant for which a
general solution for the boundary coefficients was found [ 25 ] , that
was later generalized to unoriented surfaces in [ 53 ] . Diagonal
invariants have @xmath but their apparent simplicity can be misleading
as they are sometimes inconsistent due to lack of NIMreps [ 29 ] .
Another way to obtain automorphism invariants is by means of simple
currents [ 22 ] . Simple current invariants form a very large and
important subset of modular invariants.

##### Extension invariants

In this case the chiral algebra has unused extended symmetry. There are
various types of extensions, but the most common ones are simple current
based extensions, for which case the torus modular invariant is
typically of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath labeling the simple current’s fixed-points and @xmath an
integer. This form shows explicitly the characters of the unextended
algebra combining into a larger character. Extension invariants have
links to symmetry-breaking boundary conditions [ 26 ] [ 27 ] , but we
will not pursue that subject here.

There exist also modular invariants that are combinations of
automorphisms and extensions. A torus of type

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

would be the general form of such an invariant.

##### Exceptional invariants

If the modular invariant is neither C-diagonal nor based in some simple
current, the invariant is said to be exceptional . Solutions for the
exceptional cases are hard to find since there are no symmetry
principles underlying them. One however can still try a case-specific
analysis of exceptional invariants.

An exceptional invariant can take many forms when written in terms of
characters, so there is no typical example thereof. The list of known
exceptional is somewhat scattered. For some of the results check [ 54 ]
and section 4.5.3 .

#### 4.4.2 The Cardy-Rome example

In this section we introduce a solution originally proposed by Cardy and
later extended by Sagnotti et al. We also introduce a slight
modification of it, which will show up in the solutions of the orbifold
exceptional invariants of next chapter.

The Cardy-Rome solution takes the C-diagonal torus partition function.
For the C-diagonal invariant all chiral labels are Ishibashi labels and
every chiral field is a transverse field. There is thus a one-to-one
correspondence between chiral labels and boundary conditions. The
boundary and crosscap coefficients found by Cardy and Sagnotti et al.
are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

These lead to the following Klein bottle, annulus and Moebius
coefficients

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

The @xmath is also known as Frobenius-Schur indicator [ 55 ] . This is
an index for a chiral label @xmath , such that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

By means of the following property of @xmath found by Bantay [ 55 ] ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

we can prove that the Klein bottle and Moebius integrality conditions
are satisfied. The Klein bottle constraint is trivially satisfied
because the Frobenius-Schur indicator is conserved in fusion. All other
consistency requirements are also met.

##### Non-trivial Klein bottles

We can do a little twist of the above by using any simple current the
conformal field theory may eventually have. Take again the C-diagonal
invariant and a simple current @xmath . Postulate new boundary and
crosscap coefficients [ 42 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

The new Klein bottle, annulus and Moebius coefficients are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

Again, one can check that these coefficients satisfy the integrality
conditions. The modified Klein bottle coefficient can be interpreted as
different choices for the symmetrization of the @xmath projection. Klein
bottle coefficients of the form ( 4.58 ) go by the nickname ‘non-trivial
Klein bottle’. Proving integrality can be done using [ 56 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

together with some properties of the @xmath - and @xmath -matrices and a
bit of algebra. The Klein bottle constraint can be proved using some
properties of @xmath and conservation of a quantity called ‘simple
current charge’ in fusion. See [ 42 ] for details. Again, all other
consistency requirements are met.

### 4.5 U-NIMreps for other invariants

In this section we review some of the current results regarding
U-NIMreps for invariants other than the Cardy one.

#### 4.5.1 Simple current invariants

As we have seen in section 4.4.1 , simple currents can be used to
construct modular invariant partition functions. The question is then
what are the open descendants that go with these tori.

The first steps in this direction were taken in [ 57 ] , which wrote
down NIMreps for @xmath and some @xmath WZW models. In [ 18 ] U-NIMreps
for @xmath WZW models were written. Then in [ 44 ] boundary coefficients
for automorphism invariants induced by @xmath simple currents were
given.

Later on, in [ 26 ] a generalization of the boundary and annulus
coefficients to extension invariants was presented. There it was also
noticed that from the point of view of the unextended theory some of the
boundary conditions would break part the symmetry of the extended
theory. This corresponded to having @xmath ’s in ( 4.5 ) other than the
identity.

In [ 43 ] , boundary and crosscap coefficients for automorphism
invariants that preserve all of the extended symmetries were given. This
concluded the construction of open descendants for @xmath simple current
extensions and also included non-trivial Klein bottles. Crosscaps for
@xmath extension invariants were written in [ 58 ] .

The subject was finally wrapped up in [ 27 ] and [ 59 ] , where
universal formulas for a general simple current invariant were written
down that summarize today’s knowledge of the open descendants
construction on these models. It is important to stress that these
formulas work for any simple current invariant, be it automorphism,
extension or a combination thereof and can be shown to lead to Klein
bottle, annulus and Moebius coefficients that satisfy positivity and
integrality. The universal formulas provide furthermore a lot of
physical insight. For instance, the issues of symmetry-breaking
boundaries and their relation to unextended and extended chiral algebras
is now well understood.

#### 4.5.2 Diagonal invariants

Pure diagonal invariants @xmath were tackled in [ 60 ] for the case of
WZW models. The procedure there was to look at an extended chiral
algebra @xmath and consider an orbifold sub-group thereof, with chiral
algebra @xmath , that preserved only part of the bulk symmetry. The
symmetry-breaking boundaries of the orbifold theory were related to a
charge conjugation automorphism @xmath on ( 4.4 ) and these corresponded
to the symmetry-preserving boundary conditions of the diagonal invariant
of the @xmath -theory.

However, in spite of the simplicity of their torus, diagonal invariants
do not necessarily correspond to sensible conformal field theories. The
point is that some models do not admit NIMreps for the diagonal
invariant. In [ 29 ] some examples were presented where this happens.
Presumably the orbifold theory does not exist for those examples.

That the diagonal invariant might be unphysical is the surprising result
mentioned in the introduction. It is certainly an interesting and
important problem to be addressed in future research.

#### 4.5.3 Exceptional invariants

Exceptional invariants, as the name suggests, typically have no
universal mechanism that can be used to derive S- and U-NIMreps from
first principles. Their analysis is thus usually done case by case.

The first results for these type of invariants were the NIMreps of the
@xmath -type invariants of @xmath WZW models [ 57 ] , whose ‘ @xmath ’
invariant was later supplemented with U-NIMreps by [ 18 ] . In [ 28 ] ,
boundary coefficients for the @xmath WZW exceptional extension invariant
were written. Chapter 5 presents S- and U-NIMreps for yet another case,
the exceptional invariants of extended free boson orbifolds [ 61 ] . The
free boson orbifolds are an explicit example of how one can use the
integral data from the formalism developed in the present chapter to
induce U-NIMreps for a class of exceptional modular invariants.

New results for exceptional invariants were presented in [ 29 ] . These
are the exceptional automorphisms and extensions of WZW models (see [ 48
] for notation). WZW automorphisms were classified in [ 62 ] . WZW
extensions can be related to conformal embeddings ( @xmath , in the
table below and classified in [ 63 ] ), higher spin extensions (HSE,
some of which were classified in [ 64 ] ) or simple current extensions
(SC) admitting exceptional U-NIMreps in addition to those covered by [
27 ] . In table 4.1 we present the outcome. These results are based on a
complete computer search and are presented from the point of view of the
unextended theory. Note also that, since all conformal embeddings are at
level 1, the level index in the embedding CFT was dropped.

The data presentation is best explained with an example. Take for
instance @xmath . This model is first extended by a simple current and
then embedded in @xmath . It has 2 NIMreps, the first of which gives
rise to 2 S-NIMreps and the other to 3 S-NIMreps. Then each of these
S-NIMreps gives rise respectively to (0+1) and (0+1+1) U-NIMreps.

When the conformal field theory is complex, one can extend either the
C-diagonal or the diagonal invariant. The latter is marked with an
asterisk in HSE @xmath . In the extension invariants, following the
discussion of section 4.3.9 , we have allowed for violations of the
Klein bottle constraint (but no other condition). These are marked with
an asterisk in the U-NIMrep column. For more details the reader is
referred to [ 29 ] .

It is possible to get boundary and crosscap coefficients the
automorphism invariant models. As an example we take @xmath . The
boundaries are @xmath . For the extension models it is not possible to
extract boundaries and crosscaps from the integral data because of the
degeneracy labels of Ishibashi states (cf. [ 29 ] ).

## Chapter 5 Free bosons

In this chapter we study internal conformal field theories with central
charge @xmath . From the geometrical point of view, these theories
correspond to compactifying one dimension of a String Theory. For the
bosonic case this means going to @xmath , and for superstring theories
to @xmath . If one takes tensor products of various of these theories,
one goes further down in dimension, so, restricting oneself to the
@xmath case is only limiting as far as it means selecting one of the
possible branches in the huge tree of compactification possibilities.

We concentrate on @xmath conformal field theories that are not tensor
product theories nor the limit @xmath of Virasoro minimal models [ 65 ]
. This restricts us to a few cases only. For these cases the chiral
algebra can have extended symmetries, which we will take into account in
order to lower the number of primary fields so that a rational conformal
field theory is reached. With the models identified, the integrality
conditions will be used to write down boundary and crosscap
coefficients.

### 5.1 Classification of @xmath theories

The space of @xmath theories is summarized by the following picture

We see there are three types of @xmath theories: free bosons (horizontal
line), orbifolds thereof (vertical line) and three special theories,
nicknamed TOI (three dots). The lines are the moduli space of a
continuous parameter. For the free boson we call it @xmath and for the
orbifold @xmath . There is no formal proof that this picture is
complete, and there are indeed indications that it is not [ 66 ] .

##### Free bosons

These are simply conformal field theories of a compact field @xmath ,
with the same classical action of the bosonic string @xmath , subject to
periodic boundary conditions

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath the winding number. This relaxed periodicity condition, as
compared to the usual closed string @xmath , reflects the fact that the
space-time coordinate @xmath is periodic, with @xmath the number of
times the string winds around the compact dimension. The geometrical
interpretation corresponding to this conformal field theory is that of a
coordinate compactified in a circle of radius @xmath . At special values
of the radius @xmath the chiral algebra extends, as we will see below.

The free boson theory at radius @xmath is actually equivalent to the
same theory at @xmath . This is @xmath -duality (see below). Because of
it, it is enough to consider only @xmath to get all inequivalent free
boson theories. We could have chosen @xmath instead (the dashed line in
fig. 5.1 ), but the choice above is more convenient for our purposes.

##### Free boson orbifolds

This is the same compact field @xmath , but this time with the
identifications

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Geometrically, the orbifold theory can be interpreted as
compactification in a line segment. Of all the @xmath theories,
orbifolds have the richest structure.

The line that represents the moduli space of the orbifold theory
actually touches that of the free boson: the free boson theory at @xmath
is the same theory as the orbifold of the free boson at self-dual radius
@xmath .

##### TOI theories

These were discovered by Ginsparg in [ 67 ] by taking special orbifolds
of the @xmath circle theory. Boundary and crosscap states were
investigated in [ 68 ] , using the simple current methods of [ 27 ]
together with the formalism of [ 26 ] . Higher-loop consistency
conditions of TOI models will not be checked, so these will be skipped
from now on.

### 5.2 Extended free bosons and orbifolds

Here we present some details regarding the free boson and orbifold
conformal field theories with which we will work throughout the rest of
this book.

#### 5.2.1 Free bosons

The compactified free boson conformal field theory is defined by the
action

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

with the free boson field subject to the periodicity @xmath . We use the
conventions of [ 69 ] , except for the closed string periodicity, on
which we use a conformal dilation @xmath to arrive at the same
periodicity conventions of ( 2.1 ).

After canonical quantization, the general solution for the compact free
boson quantum field is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath the usual position, momentum and creation/annihilation
operators. The operator @xmath is the winding operator. Winding modes
are a typical stringy phenomena; they cannot exist for point-particle
field theories because particles cannot wrap. Single-valuedness of the
string wave-function around the compact dimension requires

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

which restricts the eigenvalues of the string linear momentum to the
Kaluza-Klein values @xmath . We now split @xmath into left- and
right-components @xmath . Defining left- and right-momenta we get

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.6)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

with @xmath the left and right momentum operators, which have
eigenvalues respectively

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

The integers @xmath are usually referred to as momentum and winding
numbers. (The winding number is the eigenvalue of the winding operator
@xmath .) In the following, we take the convention of fig. 5.1 and set
@xmath . Note that interchanging simultaneously @xmath and @xmath leaves
the spectrum invariant - this is the statement of @xmath -duality.

We now go from the cylinder coordinates @xmath to the usual coordinates
on the complex plane @xmath via the conformal transformation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

In terms of the coordinates on the plane, the free boson quantum field
becomes

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.9)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

The free boson chiral algebra contains the Virasoro algebra, generated
by @xmath and @xmath , and the operator @xmath ¹ ¹ 1 We abbreviate
@xmath by @xmath and @xmath by @xmath . . Note that due to the
logarithmic branch cut when @xmath , the field @xmath itself is not a
conformal field. The conformal fields are instead combinations of
highest-weight states of the free boson algebra that are created by
acting on the vacuum state with the so-called vertex operators

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are left and right momentum eigenvalues and the dots @xmath
denote the usual normal ordering of the oscillator modes @xmath . In
order to keep the notation uncluttered, we drop the dots from now on,
with the understanding that all vertex operators are normally ordered.

If one considers the Virasoro algebra only, all the @xmath are primary
fields, but we can use extra symmetries to extend the chiral algebra
further. Consider integer spin currents of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

These are simple currents and can be used to extend the chiral algebra [
19 ] . As in any extension, the representations of the chiral algebra
enlarge and fields that were primary before the extension can become
descendants afterwards. For the free boson what happens is that the
infinity of states created from @xmath can be reorganized into a finite
set of primary fields @xmath and the extended conformal field theory
becomes rational. By considering the operator product expansion of the
vertex operators with the chiral extension currents

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

we see that if operator locality (no branch cuts) is to be preserved,
the extension is only possible when @xmath , with @xmath positive
integer. For more details of this construction see for instance [ 19 ]
or [ 69 ] .

The extended free boson conformal field theory contains the following
set of chiral fields

We added a column with the form of the vertex operator for the diagonal
theory @xmath , with whom we can calculate the correlators which will be
needed to test perturbative consistency at higher loops. We use the term
‘chiral field’ or ‘chiral label’ to designate chiral halves of full
conformal fields. The labels @xmath lead then to @xmath . Again, full
conformal fields are objects in @xmath , whose precise form is
determined by the modular invariant. Of the charged chiral fields,
@xmath is real ( @xmath ), the others complex ( @xmath ).

The operator product expansion of the full conformal field in the
diagonal theory can be evaluated explicitly by manually redoing the
normal ordering. The result is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since in the diagonal theory the left-right coupling is @xmath , we
abbreviate @xmath to @xmath (and likewise for the primary fields @xmath
). So we see the operator product coefficients in this field
normalization are simply @xmath . Note also that a primary field @xmath
will not exist if @xmath . In this case the operator product is into
@xmath , at a descendant level. This is because from the unextended
point of view @xmath for @xmath was a primary field, but in the extended
theory it becomes a descendant. Another important operator product is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

from which we get the orbifold theory operator product @xmath (see
below).

The extended free boson chiral algebra is generated by @xmath . This is
the @xmath affine algebra at level @xmath , or in short @xmath , which
is why the compactification radius of the free boson is sometimes
referred in the literature as @xmath .

##### Free bosons open descendants

The construction of open descendants for the case of free bosons is very
simple because all possible modular invariants are just simple current
automorphism and extension invariants. For these, the boundary and
crosscap coefficients can be calculated using the formalism of [ 27 ] .

#### 5.2.2 Free bosons orbifolds

We can take an orbifold of the extended free boson theory by dividing
out the @xmath symmetry @xmath and keeping the states invariant under
this symmetry. This projects out part of the spectrum, so the chiral
algebra will not contain contain the operators @xmath and @xmath , but
we can still form invariant combinations such as @xmath . From now on we
will be working with the orbifold theory exclusively, so we drop the
subscript from @xmath .

Since the unprojected field content was complete, removing some of the
fields renders the theory non-local, e.g. branch cuts will appear in
some operator products. To restore consistency one has to add new
fields, the twisted sector fields. The chiral field content of the
extended orbifold and diagonal vertexes turns out to be

(See [ 70 ] for more information on the @xmath diagonal vertex
operators.) We have inserted some overall normalizations to ensure that
the two-point functions are proportional to unity. We did not include
the explicit form of the twisted sector vertex operators, since these
will not play a role ² ² 2 The explicit form can be found for example on
[ 71 ] . . The simple current @xmath can be used to extend the orbifold
theory back into the parent free boson theory at @xmath . The diagonal
vertex operators coming from @xmath form the conformal field @xmath and
likewise the diagonal vertex @xmath gives rise to @xmath . The form of
the vertex operators for the diagonal conformal fields @xmath and @xmath
is slightly different, even though they come from similar free boson
fields, but this but a straightforward generalization of the vertex
operators one gets by studying the equivalence between orbifold @xmath
and the tensor product of two Ising models (see for instance the
textbook [ 72 ] or [ 73 ] ).

##### Field complexification for @xmath odd

The conformal fields @xmath behave differently depending on whether
@xmath is odd or even. They are real fields for @xmath even and complex
fields for @xmath odd. The twist fields also show this behavior. Since
the orbifold vertex operators ( 5.2 ) will always give rise to real
fields, for the @xmath odd case one must complexify the @xmath fields by
means of the following complex linear combinations

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.15)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

These are the true conformal fields for @xmath odd.

##### Orbifold fusion rules

The fusion rules of the orbifold theory are needed to find the NIMreps.
Since the orbifold @xmath -matrix depends on the compactification
parameter @xmath [ 74 ] , the orbifold fusion rules change accordingly.
In the following we define

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is to make sure the labels of @xmath fall into the allowed range
@xmath . For @xmath even we have fusion rules (with @xmath standing for
any field and taking @xmath ),

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.17)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- --

Cases not covered by this table can be derived from it using the
totally-symmetric nature of @xmath (all indices lowered). For @xmath odd
the fusion rules are mostly the same, but there are a few changes

### 5.3 Open descendants for orbifolds

Most of the modular invariant partition functions of free boson
orbifolds are just simple current and extension invariants. The boundary
and crosscap coefficients for these cases are straightforward to
evaluate by means of [ 27 ] . However, the orbifold possesses a class of
modular invariants that is exceptional. In some cases, it is possible to
find some underlying symmetry principle and from it derive boundary
coefficients [ 28 ] , but in general this is not possible and the only
way to solve the problem is empirically. This is the case for the
orbifold: its exceptional invariants are related to automorphisms of the
fusion rules that are not related to any simple current. From the
geometrical point of view, exceptional invariants correspond to
compactifications on a circle of fractional radius. The results of this
section appeared in [ 61 ] .

##### The exceptional torus

The exceptional invariant of the orbifold theory can be built using an
automorphism @xmath whose simultaneous action on all labels of a fusion
coefficient leaves the coefficient invariant: @xmath . This automorphism
acts non-trivially on the chiral labels @xmath only, as described in
appendix A . The torus modular invariant partition function is then

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

This torus will be modular invariant for @xmath odd and such that its
prime number decomposition contains at least two different prime factors
[ 54 ] [ 62 ] . The first @xmath that comply to these requirements are
15, 21, 33, 35, 45, etc. In this thesis we will focus on the case @xmath
, with @xmath and both prime. The automorphism acts in such a way that
the fields ³ ³ 3 We denote by @xmath multiples of @xmath , with zero
included, when possible. @xmath couple with themselves on the torus
(self-couple), whereas the remaining @xmath couple amongst themselves
crosswise. Since the @xmath are real, the transverse fields (or
Ishibashi labels) are @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , in total @xmath of
them.

We can construct another exceptional invariant replacing @xmath with the
charge conjugation matrix @xmath in ( 5.19 ). We will call the two
invariants as “diagonal + automorphism” (D+A) and “Cardy + automorphism”
(C+A) respectively. In C+A @xmath become transverse fields, raising the
total number of these to @xmath .

Geometrically, these two tori correspond to free boson compactification
on the fractional circle of radius @xmath and its @xmath -dual.

##### Klein bottle projections

Having the torus, we can look for the Klein bottle projection. As usual,
the Klein bottle has to be such that non-transverse fields do not
propagate in the transverse channel; in other words, that their crosscap
coefficient @xmath vanishes. The simplest way to get @xmath is to invert
( 4.15 ), from which we conclude that the signs @xmath of the direct
channel Klein bottle have to be such that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the D+A case this condition is satisfied for the “trivial” Klein
bottle projection, @xmath for all the fields coupling diagonally on the
torus. By the mechanism explained in chapter 4 , the simple current
@xmath generates a second Klein bottle, this one with @xmath on the four
twist fields @xmath and @xmath and @xmath for the other diagonal fields.
There are several other Klein bottle choices that satisfy the sum rule (
5.20 ), but if in addition we impose the Klein bottle constraint these
are the only two that are allowed.

In the C+A case we observe first of all that surprisingly the trivial
choice @xmath for all the fields coupling diagonally on the torus
violates the sum rule ( 5.20 ). There are however several Klein bottle
choices satisfying the sum rule, and two of them also satisfy the Klein
bottle constraint. One has @xmath when @xmath is an odd multiple of
@xmath and @xmath for the remaining fields coupling diagonally on the
torus, and the other has @xmath when @xmath is an odd multiple of @xmath
and @xmath for the remaining fields coupling diagonally on the torus.
These two Klein bottle choices are again related by the action of a
simple current, this time @xmath .

##### Annulus and Moebius strip

For the two aforementioned Klein bottles of D+A and C+A it is possible
to numerically solve and symmetrize the NIMrep equation ( 4.27 ) and
derive unoriented annulus coefficients for low @xmath . By inspection a
general formula for an annulus for arbitrary @xmath can then be
postulated. Finally, using ( 4.15 ) we can solve for boundary and
crosscap coefficients to get a complete set of boundary and crosscap
coefficients.

Working backwards, starting from the boundary and crosscap coefficients
discovered, one can check positivity and integrality of the postulated
Klein bottle, annulus and Moebius strip. The proof, albeit
straightforward, is rather lengthy and will therefore not be written
here. One needs simple algebra plus the Gauss summation formula [ 75 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

to simplify the expressions arising.

#### 5.3.1 D+A invariant

The boundary and crosscap coefficients of the D+A torus are as follows.
We define U-crosscap coefficient as @xmath . This is the analog of the
reflection coefficient @xmath . Recall also that the reflection
coefficient includes the orientifold factor @xmath .

The D+A invariant has one NIMrep, which can be symmetrized in four ways.
Of these four S-NIMreps, three do not admit U-NIMreps and are thus
viewed as unphysical. The fourth S-NIMrep leads to two U-NIMreps.

##### D+A crosscaps

For the D+A case and trivial Klein bottle, the U-crosscap coefficients
are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

The dots stand for zero entries and the under-brackets show exactly for
which @xmath is the @xmath U-crosscap coefficient non-vanishing. We used
the sign freedom @xmath to define the coefficients such that for this
Klein bottle they are all positive.

The second Klein bottle, with @xmath for the twist fields, has @xmath
and @xmath interchanged and also a minus sign for @xmath . Note that for
both cases all non-transverse fields have vanishing U-crosscap
coefficient, as expected.

##### D+A boundaries

Before displaying the reflection coefficients, we first classify the
possible boundary conditions that are found from inverting the annulus.
It turns out that three types of boundary conditions are possible:

-   Type @xmath . This type contains two boundary conditions, @xmath and
    @xmath , regardless of @xmath .

-   Type @xmath . These split further into two subsets, @xmath and
    @xmath , with @xmath an odd integer ranging from @xmath to @xmath .
    Each of these subsets contains thus @xmath boundary conditions,
    amounting to @xmath boundary conditions coming from this type of
    boundary.

-   Type @xmath . Similar to type @xmath . It splits into subsets @xmath
    and @xmath (with odd @xmath ranging from @xmath to @xmath this
    time). It contains @xmath boundary conditions.

There are @xmath boundary conditions in total, as many as the transverse
fields.

The reflection coefficients are the same for both Klein bottle
projections, as there is only one physical S-NIMrep. These are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

As expected, the non-transverse fields have vanishing reflection
coefficients. Suppressing the zero columns in ( 5.23 ), we come to an
orthogonal, invertible square matrix, as required by the completeness
conditions. Note that for the limiting case @xmath the boundaries @xmath
and @xmath are both equal to @xmath . It is however convenient to treat
the @xmath -boundaries separately.

The boundary conjugation matrix is trivial. All boundaries are
self-conjugate. With the knowledge of the U-crosscap and reflection
coefficients we can now calculate direct channel annulus and Moebius
strip coefficients.

##### D+A annulus

For briefness we present only the diagonal annulus @xmath , which
contains the most important information concerning integrality. The
remaining off-diagonal annuli @xmath can easily be derived too. Using (
4.15 ) we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

We dropped the superscript @xmath because there is only one S-NIMrep.

##### D+A Moebius strip

Evaluating ( 4.15 ) for the trivial Klein bottle projection gives us the
Moebius strip of the first U-NIMrep

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

For the second U-NIMrep the Klein bottle has @xmath on the twist fields
and the Moebius is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is straightforward to show that ( 5.24 - 5.26 ) respect the
positivity and integrality conditions for the open sector and that (
5.23 ) leads to a positive integer off-diagonal annulus @xmath .

Note also that both Klein bottle projections come from the same
S-NIMrep. The difference lies in the signs of the Moebius, so for the
two cases some branes are identified with different signs.

#### 5.3.2 C+A invariant

Most quantities are similar to the D+A case, but there are some
differences nevertheless. There is again one NIMrep which leads to two
S-NIMreps, each of which in turn produces one U-NIMrep.

We present the results for the Klein bottle with @xmath when @xmath is
an odd multiple of @xmath and @xmath for remaining the fields that
couple diagonally on the torus. Since in the C+A case no quantity is
proportional to the difference @xmath , the results for the second Klein
bottle are obtained by simply interchanging @xmath on the formulas
below.

##### C+A crosscaps

The U-crosscap coefficients are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

##### C+A boundaries

Next we classify the possible boundaries conditions. As in the (D+A)
case we get a certain number fixed boundaries along with an expanding
part which depends on the odd parameter @xmath .

-   Type @xmath . There are two subtypes of @xmath -type boundaries,
    @xmath and @xmath which are real (as in self-conjugate). The
    boundaries @xmath and @xmath are unique but complex, thus admitting
    conjugate boundaries @xmath and @xmath respectively. In total these
    four types generate eight boundary conditions.

-   Type @xmath . This type of boundary is real and splits into subtypes
    @xmath and @xmath , with odd @xmath ranging from 1 to @xmath , and
    contributes with a total of @xmath boundary conditions.

-   Type @xmath . This type is complex and thus splits into @xmath and
    its conjugate @xmath , with off @xmath ranging from 1 to @xmath ,
    and contributes with @xmath boundary conditions.

The total number of boundaries is thus @xmath , as many as the
transverse fields, as expected.

The reflection coefficients are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Again, both the U-crosscap and reflection coefficients vanish on the
non-transverse fields.

The reflection coefficients for boundary conditions @xmath and @xmath
are simply the complex conjugates of their unprimed counterparts. The
boundary conjugation matrix is off-diagonal for @xmath and @xmath , with
the primed boundaries as conjugates.

Since we have two S-NIMreps we must use the label @xmath in the annulus
coefficients. Define @xmath and @xmath , with the latter standing for
the data with @xmath and @xmath interchanged. The diagonal annulus and
Moebius strip that go with the U-crosscap and reflection coefficients of
( LABEL:Uc+a - 5.28 ) are

##### C+A annulus

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

##### C+A Moebius strip

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

Positivity and integrality of the diagonal annulus and Moebius strip is
explicit. Again it can be shown that ( 5.28 ) leads to positive integer
off-diagonal annulus.

Since in @xmath only @xmath depends on the orientifold projection, we
can determine the ratio @xmath by expanding and analyzing the annulus
coefficients for both U-NIMreps. We find that the orientifold ratio is
@xmath for @xmath a twist field and @xmath on the other fields. The
@xmath turn out to be phases, which is not a problem provided @xmath .

We see that the exceptional invariants of the orbifold theory are
conformal field theories with a very rich structure that displays many
theoretical properties. A possibility for future work would be to
generalize the results of this section to arbitrary @xmath . It would
also be nice to determine more of the quantities involved, like for
instance @xmath . As mentioned before, this requires knowledge of fusing
matrices. These matrices are also needed to examine consistency at
higher loops. This is the path we now turn to.

## Chapter 6 Consistency of the perturbative expansion

In the last chapters we presented positivity and integrality
requirements that can be used to build a consistent String Theory. When
met, these one-loop requirements ensure a sensible spectrum. One might
then wonder how can perturbative consistency be checked to higher orders
in string perturbation theory, particularly since as the Euler number
grows, direct evaluation of the possible diagrams gets nigh impossible.
The solution is to use some sort of induction mechanism, from which
consistency at order @xmath would imply consistency at order @xmath .

Such an induction mechanism exists and it is called “sewing
constraints”. It works as follows. When one sews together two
world-sheet surfaces that individually lead to consistent transition
amplitudes, in the sense that the latter are unambiguous and factorize
correctly, the resulting surface will have consistent transition
amplitudes as well, if the sewing constraints are satisfied. These
constraints have been developed step by step, starting with the closed
string constraints of [ 7 ] [ 76 ] . Later on, in [ 8 ] constraints
involving oriented open strings were formulated. Finally, in [ 9 ]
constraints for unoriented strings appeared. The sewing constraints are
definitely necessary for consistency, although it is not yet clear they
are sufficient, because a complete analysis for surfaces with crosscaps
has not yet been done.

The explicit form of the various sewing constraints equations all have
one point in common: they need specific data from the conformal field
theory at hand. This was not the case with positivity and integrality of
the closed and open sectors; there the results were general and needed
only very basic data like conformal weights, the @xmath -matrix and the
modular invariant. For checking the sewing constraints, in addition to
the basic data we will need also information from the theory’s
correlators. To prove perturbative consistency of a String Theory one
would in principle have to find or postulate this information and verify
that it indeed is a solution to the sewing constraints.

The sewing constraints actually relate some of the model-specific
quantities, so not all of them need to be independent. Following this
line of reasoning, in [ 39 ] it is shown that the knowledge of chiral
data and a special symmetric Frobenius algebra is sufficient to generate
correlators of a full conformal field theory and to prove that they will
automatically satisfy the sewing constraints on oriented surfaces. In
particular, knowledge of only one conformally invariant boundary
condition is enough to build the remaining ones and to derive the form
of the torus and annulus partition function. The method of [ 39 ]
provides a lot of data, but it uses properties of the case-specific
fusing and braiding matrices, which would have to be computed for each
case, should one be interested in precise figures of the chiral data.
The fusing and braiding matrices are therefore a very crucial piece of
data upon which much of the conformal field theory revolves. It is
therefore the aim of the final chapters of this thesis to go as far as
possible into the explicit evaluation of these quantities for @xmath
theories.

Before doing this, we briefly review sewing constraints explicitly to
show where they come from. For this purpose we review also boundary
conformal field theory.

### 6.1 Boundary conformal field theory

In the same way closed strings can be mapped to a complex plane, open
strings can be mapped into a complex half-plane with @xmath . Time flows
again in circles from @xmath to infinite and the real line @xmath
corresponds to the the open string end point at @xmath and @xmath to the
end point at @xmath . In chapter 3 the closed conformal field theory was
studied, so now it is time to have a look at the open string conformal
field theory, which is conformal field theory on the half-plane (instead
of the full plane, which is the sphere).

In chapter 4 , the boundaries of the annulus were analyzed in the
transverse channel, where they were defined in terms of Ishibashi
states, which are again closed string states. Because of closed-open
string world-sheet duality, we would then like to know what happens at a
true boundary of a surface where a conformal field theory lives. If the
two ends of an open string have different boundary conditions, say
@xmath and @xmath , there must be some disturbance along the real
boundary line @xmath such that the boundary condition changes from
@xmath to @xmath . That disturbance is called a boundary field . This
can be seen from the picture

The boundary field @xmath is then an insertion at point @xmath in the
real line mediating the change from boundary conditions @xmath to @xmath
, which has a chiral label attached. An heuristic way to see why the
chiral label appears is to notice that if we sew two half-planes through
the real line, we get a full complex plane, where fields have the two
holomorphic and anti-holomorphic labels. It is natural then for the
boundary fields to have only one chiral label.

The number of boundary fields @xmath depends on the torus modular
invariant. The invariant determines how many Ishibashi states there are,
which is equal to the number of independent conformally invariant
boundary conditions. Then the number of irreducible representations of
the extended chiral algebra gives the number of chiral labels. Acting on
the boundary field with the creation operators of the chiral algebra
generates boundary descendant fields.

#### 6.1.1 Boundary operator products

Naturally, one can have more than one boundary field present at the real
line of the complex half-plane. This corresponds to an array of open
strings scattering off a disk diagram. Then two questions arise: what
happens when two boundary fields come close to each other and what
happens when a bulk field approaches a boundary? In these cases, one can
define a short-distance operator product expansion, just like he does
for bulk fields. These expansions take the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.1)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

The dots represent, as usual, descendants contributions. So, when two
boundary fields come close, the change of boundary conditions can be
expressed as if a linear combination of boundary fields was present,
with strength given by the boundary-boundary operator product
coefficients . Likewise, when a bulk field approaches a boundary of type
@xmath , it dissipates into a sum of boundary fields, with strength
given by the bulk-boundary operator product coefficients . This last
coefficient can be related to the boundary coefficients @xmath (see for
instance [ 77 ] ).

#### 6.1.2 Conformal blocks

We have seen in chapter 3 that correlation functions of bulk conformal
fields @xmath on the sphere are heavily constrained by conformal
invariance. The four-point function is the first correlator whose form
isn’t totally constrained. This correlator can be written in a canonical
form, like for instance ( 3.17 ), but can also be expanded as a bilinear
sum of functions called ‘conformal blocks’ or ‘chiral blocks’ [ 16 ] .
This can be done in three ways

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (6.2)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- -------

The functions @xmath and @xmath are the chiral (or holomorphic) and
anti-chiral (or anti-holomorphic) conformal blocks for correlator @xmath
. The expansions ( 6.2 ) have the following meaning. One can take
operator products of the fields, effectively reducing the four-point
function to an infinite combination of two-point functions. There are
three ways of contracting the four fields to form a two-point function,
respectively @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , which correspond to the three
expressions above and are called the @xmath -, @xmath - and @xmath
-channel expansions.

Conformal invariance allows us to fix three of the four insertion
points. The usual choice is @xmath and will be henceforth referred to as
‘canonical insertion points’. In terms of this choice, equation ( 6.2 )
becomes ¹ ¹ 1 In other conventions, like for instance [ 78 ] , the
canonical insertions are different, which leads to some swapping of the
chiral labels.

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (6.3)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- -------

The factor @xmath is put in to absorb the divergence coming from pulling
@xmath to infinity.

The conformal block functions @xmath are in general multi-valued
functions on the @xmath -plane with branch points at @xmath . To get an
unambiguous definition for them, we take a branch cut running from
@xmath to 1 along the real line. While correlators are only defined when
there is radial ordering of the insertion points, the conformal blocks
are defined throughout the whole @xmath -plane (except on the branch
cut) by analytic continuation. Also, they obey certain differential
equations and conformal Ward identities that can be used to determine
their explicit form [ 16 ] .

We can assign a conformal block a picture:

This is not the most natural convention for the arrows, like the one
used in [ 76 ] [ 39 ] , but it is the most convenient one for our
purposes since the known expressions for correlators of free boson and
orbifold theories have all ingoing lines. From the channel expansions,
we see that the operator product coefficients and the conformal blocks
can be normalized together. We take as normalization

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

As we will see in next section, in the presence of extended chiral
algebras this definition deserves some comments.

The three channels for expanding the bulk four-point function lead to
three different sets of conformal blocks, with pictures as in fig. 6.3 .

Since the three expansions represent the same thing, the three different
basis of conformal blocks must be related by some linear, invertible
relation. Therefore there must exist two sets of matrices that
interpolate between these pictures. These are the duality matrices, or
braiding and fusing matrices. We will define these matrices in the next
chapter. They will enable us to execute moves and changes in the
conformal blocks pictures, so that one can use graphical calculus with
pictures to derive identities instead of having do deal with the
explicit infinite sums.

The requirement that the three channels produce equal four-point
functions will force a relation between operator product coefficients
and fusing matrices. This will be our first sewing constraint.

#### 6.1.3 Boundary correlation functions

In the same way bulk correlators can be decomposed into bilinear
combinations of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic conformal blocks, it
turns out that boundary correlators can be decomposed into linear
combinations of the same blocks.

Conformal invariance fixes the form of the boundary one-, two- and
three-point functions. By suitably normalizing the bulk and boundary
fields, these three amplitudes on the disk with boundary condition
@xmath are ² ² 2 When a disk with boundary condition @xmath is mapped
into the complex half-plane, the boundary condition at @xmath is the
same as the one at @xmath . Therefore the cyclicity in the boundary
indices on ( 6.5 ).

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.5)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

It is possible to write the sewing constraints in such a way that the
normalization factor @xmath drops out from all expressions. The formulas
of next section are written in this form.

A general correlation function on a surface with boundaries will contain
various insertions of boundary fields and bulk fields. The usual way to
deal with the bulk fields is to use a bulk-boundary operator product
expansion to rewrite them as combinations of boundary fields and then
evaluate the resulting correlator, which will consist solely of boundary
fields and must therefore be a conformal block. This is sometimes
referred to as the ‘doubling trick’, and corresponds pictorially to fig.
6.4 [ 38 ] .

A general correlator on a surface with one boundary, having @xmath
boundary field insertions and @xmath bulk field insertions would then be

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

which after the doubling trick becomes a chiral @xmath -point conformal
block. For a surface with two or more boundaries there will be traces
over boundary field insertions for each boundary.

### 6.2 Sewing constraints

The sewing constraints are a set of equations derived from the various
ways one has to write correlators in the bulk, boundary and in the
presence of crosscaps, as sums of conformal blocks. We discuss them now
for a maximally extended chiral algebra and arbitrary automorphism
invariant. The requirement of maximallity constrains the fusion rules to
@xmath and therefore the degeneracy labels @xmath of [ 76 ] drop out.
For this case, the model-specific pieces of data needed are

-   @xmath : bulk-bulk operator product coefficients;

-   @xmath : boundary-boundary operator product coefficients;

-   @xmath : bulk-boundary operator product coefficients;

-   @xmath : a sign, determining the symmetry of a conformal field as it
    approaches a crosscap;

-   @xmath : fusing matrix. A square matrix relating different basis of
    conformal blocks;

-   @xmath : a sign coming from interchanges of vector spaces in
    conformal blocks.

The last two are purely chiral data. They only depend on the holomorphic
chiral algebra at hand and not on how it couples to its anti-holomorphic
partner. The sign @xmath should be related to the orientifold projector
@xmath , although the relation is not yet clear. If we multiply @xmath
with a factor @xmath we get a quantity that is referred to by [ 39 ] as
@xmath . Now we can define the braiding matrix as @xmath . (This
relation can also be derived from pictures.)

#### 6.2.1 Bulk constraints

The sewing constraints involving bulk fields only were originally
written by [ 7 ] [ 16 ] as a duality equation for four-point functions
on the sphere. In [ 76 ] they were reinterpreted as consistency
constraints linking the various ways of sewing together three-point
conformal blocks. In addition, the authors of [ 76 ] derived a
constraint for the one-point function on the torus. The constraints for
the four-point function on the sphere and the one-point function on the
torus are schematically depicted in fig. 6.5 .

As stated before, duality of the four-point function on the sphere is
just the statement that the three channels should yield the same result.
Using the graphical representation for conformal blocks we can derive

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.7)
                                @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.8)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

The first equation is the statement of @xmath duality and the second
@xmath duality. Duality of the one-point function on the torus leads, in
the simple case @xmath , to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.9)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Actually, equation ( 6.9 ) is a subset of the more general equation
@xmath , which relates the two ways to sew a torus one-point function
(via the @xmath -cycle or the @xmath -cycle). This subset contains all
the non-redundant information though [ 76 ] . Later on this equation
will be checked on the orbifold theory for the simple case of @xmath .

The completeness theorem of [ 76 ] together with the analysis of [ 7 ] ,
claims that if a conformal field theory satisfies this set of equations,
then that theory will be consistent on any surface constructed by sewing
together closed, oriented sufaces. Actually, this claim has been
questioned and repaired in [ 79 ] .

#### 6.2.2 Boundary constraints

The set of sewing constraints was enlarged to conformal field theories
on surfaces with boundaries by [ 8 ] . Three new constraint equations
are found: crossing symmetry of the four-point function of boundary
fields, duality of the bulk-boundary-boundary four-point function and
duality of the bulk-bulk-boundary five-point function. The pictures that
go with this are represented in fig. 6.6 .

Looking at the picture, we see that the boundary four-point function
@xmath can be expressed in two ways, depending on whether we take
contractions @xmath or @xmath . Note that the contraction @xmath is
impossible because the boundary fields are constrained to the real line.

The bulk-boundary-boundary @xmath correlator can be expanded in two
ways, depending on which particular boundary the field faces ( @xmath or
@xmath ).

For the bulk-bulk-boundary @xmath we can either contract the bulk fields
before pulling them to the boundary or not. The equations that go with
these three constraints involve, as the ones above, fusing matrices.
These matrices depend, as we will see later, on a few so-called ‘gauge’
choices. The gauge that we will take later simplifies some fusing
matrices elements (check chapter 7 ). In this gauge the boundary sewing
constraints coming from the picture above have the form respectively

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.10)
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (6.11)
     @xmath      
                 (6.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

The quantity @xmath is defined as the Frobenius-Schur indicator for
self-conjugate @xmath and @xmath for complex @xmath . Then @xmath .
These constraints must be satisfied for the conformal field theory to be
consistent on surfaces with boundaries of any order in string
perturbation theory.

#### 6.2.3 Crosscap constraints

Finally, we check the constraints on unoriented surfaces. Not much is
known about these. The only constraint of this kind was originally
derived in [ 9 ] and later applied to @xmath WZW models [ 18 ] , where
it was used to derive crosscap coefficients. From the picture below, we
see it relates two ways of doing the short-distance expansion of a bulk
two-point function in the presence of a crosscap. The crosscap
identification makes it impossible to distinguish the field @xmath from
@xmath , thus there are two ways of writing the two-point correlator:
either contracting @xmath with @xmath or with @xmath , as fig. 6.7
shows.

Upon lifting the two expressions to a chiral correlator, an equality
arises. In the same gauge for the fusing matrices as the boundary sewing
constraints, it reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

Note that one cannot contract @xmath with @xmath because the
anti-involution defined by crosscap keeps the two labels diametrically
apart. The factor @xmath is a sign that determines the symmetry of an
Ishibashi primary field in the presence of a crosscap.

As opposed to the bulk and boundary sewing constraints, the crosscap
sewing constraint probably incomplete in the sense that there may be
more constraints on unoriented surfaces that one needs to verify. As it
is known from topology, a torus with one crosscap is topologically
equivalent to a sphere with three crosscaps. This is expected to give an
equation of type @xmath , which would fix the normalization of the
crosscap coefficients [ 80 ] . However, the precise form of constraint
has not yet been investigated.

#### 6.2.4 The role of duality matrices

As we have seen above, the sewing constraints involve the fusing and
braiding matrices. With their knowledge one can solve some of the sewing
constraints for non-trivial quantities like operator product
coefficients. One can also work the other way around and derive them by
looking for operator product coefficients and with this solving the
sewing constraints for the fusing matrices. So we see the duality
matrices are a vital tool which is decisive to solve a conformal field
theory. Even more because these matrices can, as stated in the beginning
of this chapter, lead to direct building of most conformal field theory
quantities via the method of [ 39 ] . This motivation enough to search
for these quantities, whose importance recently leaped to a major role.

In the case of the free boson and orbifolds thereof, we are in a good
position to solve the sewing constraints because some of the chiral and
non-chiral quantities are easy to get from direct evaluation of the
correlators. The bulk operator products, for instance, can be calculated
because the free boson field mode expansion is known and tractable. Once
we know the operator product coefficients and the @xmath -point
correlators [ 81 ] , we can, for instance, extract the conformal blocks
and evaluate duality matrices, which can in turn be used in the various
sewing constraints equations. In most cases however, operator product
coefficients are not so easy to get, which makes the explicit
determination of duality matrices an important thing to do, since
finding these may be the simplest way to solve the theory.

The free boson and its orbifold is one of the simplest non-trivial
examples for which there is independent knowledge of model-dependent
quantities like operator products, and this can make the whole process
solvable (at least to a certain extent). Finding the free boson and
orbifold duality matrices complements the information from operator
products and can therefore be a way to verify some of the sewing
constraints and with this the validity of the procedure of [ 39 ] .

## Chapter 7 Orbifold fusing matrices

In this chapter we explicitly evaluate orbifold duality matrices. We
will take the modular invariant to be the diagonal invariant @xmath .
Since the duality matrices are chiral data, they are independent of the
modular invariant we start from, so we might as well choose the
invariant that is easier to deal with and has the simplest form for the
vertex operators of primary fields. By inserting the vertex operators of
table 5.2 into correlators and using some known results, we will be able
to derive explicit expressions for four-point functions containing
untwisted sector fields only. We can then decompose the correlators into
bilinear sums of conformal blocks and extract the latter, with which we
can look for the duality matrices that interpolate between the various
conformal blocks. For the case of four-point correlators involving
twisted fields, the results of [ 82 ] [ 83 ] can be used to get the
conformal blocks needed to derive duality matrices.

Duality matrices obey the so-called polynomial equations of [ 76 ] .
These are three basic identities, one called the pentagon and two the
hexagons, derived from graphical calculus that are fundamental at
tree-level. Not only that, they can actually reach much further. As was
noted in [ 77 ] [ 84 ] , for a C-diagonal modular invariant there is a
one-to-one correspondence between chiral labels and boundary labels and
as such boundary operator product coefficients turn out simply to
coincide with the fusing matrices. Then the sewing constraint involving
@xmath reduces to the pentagon equation. Thus, checking the pentagon
equation for orbifold fusing matrices is already equivalent to solving
one of the orbifold sewing constraints.

It will not be possible in this work to solve all sewing constraints for
the various operator product coefficients, as the fusing matrices do not
always over-determine the problem, but it will be possible to get and
discuss many of the fusing matrices and verify they obey the key
equations.

### 7.1 Defining duality matrices

First of all we need to define the duality matrices and setup
conventions. When we take canonical insertion points, there is some
index reshuffling and the braiding and fusing matrices that relate the
bulk four-point function @xmath - and @xmath -channels to the @xmath
-channel become, for the simple case where the fusion rules are 0 or 1,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.1)
     @xmath      (7.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

The corresponding picture is 7.1 .

The operation of braiding/debraiding and fusing/defusing can be used at
the level of the pictures. Equations ( 7.2 ) will be our means to
determine free boson orbifold fusing matrices. Note that the conformal
block @xmath has its cut at @xmath running to @xmath parallel to the
real axis, while the cut for @xmath also starts at @xmath but runs to
@xmath , so that the whole real line splits the complex @xmath -plane
into two halves. Since there are two regions, there are also two
braiding matrices: @xmath . For the fusing matrix, the block on the
left-hand-side has again the cut at @xmath running to @xmath parallel to
the real axis, but now the cut for @xmath runs from @xmath to @xmath ,
leaving the region between @xmath and 2 free of cuts. Since the operator
product that defines the @xmath -channel is valid precisely in this
region, the region where @xmath is defined is free of cuts and there is
thus only one fusing matrix.

#### 7.1.1 Chiral vertex operators and gauge choices

An alternative way to understand what a conformal block is, is to refer
to the concept of chiral vertex operators [ 85 ] . A chiral vertex
operator @xmath is an intertwiner from representations @xmath into
representation @xmath at position @xmath . In the rest of the discussion
we assume the fusion rules to be 0 or 1 (see also the comments on
section 7.2 ). A conformal block is nothing but the chiral correlator of
four chiral vertex operators. The link is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

with the ingoing and outgoing states defined by @xmath and @xmath . The
normalization of chiral vertex operators can be set by looking at the
chiral three-point function

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

The normalization factor @xmath can in principle be any complex number
we want. We will call a change in the normalization factor of chiral
vertex operators a “gauge transformation”. Such action makes @xmath ,
which changes the normalization of the conformal block. The fusing
matrices change accordingly as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

A fusing matrix is therefore defined only up to gauge transformation. In
other words, two sets of fusing matrices represent different physical
conformal field theories only if they cannot be related via a gauge
transformation of type ( 7.5 ). Fixing conformal block normalization as
( 6.4 ) still allows for @xmath that are signs (or phases).

#### 7.1.2 Conformal block normalization

The asymptotic normalization of a conformal block ( 6.4 ) is only valid
when one considers the Virasoro algebra alone. In an extended chiral
algebra, the concept of primary and descendant is redefined and
conformal blocks must be renormalized accordingly. Later in this chapter
we will see that a conformal block @xmath can only be consistently
normalized to unit when @xmath are primaries. For the extended orbifold,
we take the normalization

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

If one of the labels propagates at a descendant level, the conformal
block cannot be asymptotically normalized to unity without the duality
matrices starting to depend on the descendant level; a fact that is not
consistent with their definition [ 76 ] . In this case we have to define
its normalization by referring to the unextended algebra. We will come
back to this point later.

#### 7.1.3 Duality matrices from the three-point function

Some fusing and braiding matrices can be readily evaluated by looking at
the three-point function. For the braiding matrix we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

The factor @xmath is the eigenvalue of the mapping of the vector space
of couplings @xmath to @xmath . Since doing the interchange twice brings
us back to @xmath , the eigenvalue is at most a sign and is symmetric in
the lower indexes.

The three-point fusing matrix is naively 1, but in fact depends on the
normalization of chiral vertex operators. In [ 39 ] it is argued that it
is always possible to find a normalization such that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

(See below ( 6.12 ) for a definition of @xmath .) This natural choice is
particularly simple for the orbifold theory, where all the
Frobenius-Schur indicators are +1. This choice is taken below throughout
orbifold computations.

#### 7.1.4 Pentagon and hexagon identities

Playing around with the pictorial representation of conformal blocks one
can derive several identities [ 76 ] . In fig. 7.2

have one such basic identity. Writing the whole picture above in terms
of only fusing matrices we arrive to the pentagon identity

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

The signs @xmath all cancel precisely. Setting @xmath on fig. 7.2 we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

from which we conclude that fusing and braiding matrices are related by
phases, so there is really only one duality matrix. Nevertheless, it is
often convenient to consider the two matrices separately.

Another important identity comes from picture 7.3 .

It leads to the hexagon identity

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

So we see the hexagon gives us more information on the fusing matrices
plus something about the @xmath eigenvalues. There is another hexagon
equation, which is derived from the picture 7.4

and leads to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath depending on the sense of the braidings, so there are
actually three hexagons. Actually, one can also show the hexagons are
not all independent. We can for instance use ( 7.12 ) with the plus sign
on the the same equation with the minus sign and checked that this
yields the first hexagon ( 7.11 ).

The pentagon and the two hexagons are the fundamental polynomial
equations at tree-level. Any other equation relating fusing and braiding
matrices can be shown to be a combination of the pentagon and/or hexagon
by the completeness theorem of [ 76 ] .

#### 7.1.5 Free boson fusing matrices

For completeness, we present the fusing matrices for the free boson. In
the unextended free boson case, the fusing matrices are just @xmath for
all valid indices. In the extended case it is not so simple. Some
general results for this case were presented in [ 76 ] . In [ 39 ]
results for the gauge ( 7.8 ) were presented. They are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.13)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

with @xmath with @xmath the unique integer such that @xmath , and @xmath
the @xmath for which @xmath . So we see clearly the non-trivial sign
structure of @xmath arising.

The extended free boson theory is perhaps the simplest example of
non-trivial fusing matrices. There is a for a small number of cases
where fusing matrices have been studied. These include the Virasoro
minimal models [ 86 ] and @xmath WZW models [ 87 ] . See also [ 88 ] for
some results on coset models.

### 7.2 Fusing matrices for the untwisted sector

To determine the orbifold fusing matrices we need the explicit form of
orbifold four-point correlators, and we start off by examining the
correlators involving four fields from the untwisted sector.

Since the untwisted vertex operators of the orbifold theory are
combinations of vertex operators of the free boson theory, the untwisted
orbifold correlators are simply combinations free boson correlators. The
later are given by the Koba-Nielsen formula [ 81 ] , which is a formula
for the correlator of an arbitrary number of exponentials of free boson
fields on the sphere

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

(Remember the exponentials are implicitly normally ordered.) The delta
functions ensure space-time momentum conservation; in other words, they
impose the fusion rules. In the extended free boson theory with diagonal
invariant, primary fields have @xmath and we have a simplification

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the orbifold theory, along with primary fields built out of
exponentials of @xmath , we also have the primary field @xmath . In the
free boson theory this was a descendant of the identity, but becomes a
primary in the orbifold. Orbifold correlators with @xmath present can
also be derived from ( 7.15 ) by means of appropriate partial
differentiations. We will use ( 7.15 ) and derivatives thereof as
needed.

As a reminder for the notation, we distinguish once again chiral labels
(or chiral fields) and conformal fields

-   Chiral labels: @xmath . Highest-weight states of the chiral algebra
    upon which a representation module of the algebra can be built. A
    general chiral label is designated by italic indices @xmath .
    Duality matrices are chiral objects and depend thus on the chiral
    labels.

-   Conformal fields: @xmath these are functions of @xmath and form
    combinations of chiral labels. Since we take the torus diagonal
    invariant @xmath , so we abbreviate the conformal fields by @xmath
    (and likewise for operator product coefficients). Their vertex
    operators are given by table 5.2 . The canonical correlators of four
    conformal fields are single-valued in the @xmath -plane and divide
    into conformal blocks.

In the @xmath odd case remember that the conformal fields @xmath go to
the complex combinations @xmath . For the twisted fields we use the same
notation for chiral fields and conformal fields for simplicity, but the
difference should be clear from the context.

##### Examination of the fusion rules

Before we start evaluating orbifold correlators, we look at the orbifold
fusion rules, which are always a helpful tool to probe the problem. A
nice feature of the orbifold theory is that the fusion rules are always
zero or one: @xmath . Not only does this removes the fusing matrix
degeneracy labels @xmath of [ 76 ] , which would appear in ( 7.1 ) and (
7.2 ), it also allows us to draw the following conclusion. The fusing
matrix relates bases on the space of conformal blocks of dimensions. In
our conventions, this dimensional relation is @xmath , and for the
untwisted sector we see that three things can happen

  -- -- -- --------
           (7.16)
  -- -- -- --------

Note that any fusing matrix where one of the entries is a simple current
will automatically be 1x1. The only case of the untwisted sector with
2x2 or bigger matrices is then when all the four entries are fields of
type @xmath (fixed points of @xmath ).

There are many matrices to be evaluated. We start off with 1x1 matrices
and then proceed to the bigger ones. In the end an appendix is made with
the results for easy reading.

#### 7.2.1 Using the polynomial equations to solve for unknowns

Computing the fusing matrices by extracting conformal blocks from the
untwisted four-point functions and relating them via ( 7.2 ) will not
provide us with exact results. The calculations will show ambiguities
related to the chiral algebra extension and these will have to be dealt
with.

To solve the ambiguities we resort to comparison with fusing matrices of
some known models to which the orbifold theory is equivalent, at certain
radii. From this comparison we postulate a general form for the fusing
matrices. After sorting out the ambiguities, and assuming the [ 39 ]
gauge for @xmath , we get a naive result, which will satisfy the
polynomial equations up to signs.

To get a concrete result we allow some sign freedom in the fusing
matrices elements naively calculated and @xmath to vary, with the help
of a computer, force the outcome to satisfy the pentagon and hexagon
equations. In the end it turns out that it is possible to find sign
changes in the naive result and a set of @xmath such that all the
pentagon and hexagon equations are satisfied. The result happens not to
be unique because the gauge choice is not completely fixed by @xmath .
Then, again by means of a computer, we search for gauge transformations
@xmath in ( 7.5 ), that can interpolate between the various solutions.
The result is that all solutions fall into the same gauge class, and
therefore what we have is essentially a unique result for the fusing and
braiding matrices. All these results have been checked up to @xmath .
Every pentagon and hexagon equation was tested up to this @xmath . Given
the mod 4 periodicity of the orbifold structures involved, there is thus
reason to believe these behavior will go on indefinitely so that our
solution is valid for all @xmath .

As said above, it will be necessary to introduce corrections to the
results derived solely by relating conformal blocks via ( 7.2 ). It
turns out that these corrections show up only when there are fields
propagating at descendant level in the correlators. This hints at the
chiral algebra extension being responsible for the changes, since the
extension transforms some primaries into descendants.

#### 7.2.2 Explicit calculation for the untwisted sector

The result for untwisted orbifold fusing matrices will depend on whether
@xmath is even or odd. Given the various types of chiral fields, we
split the the calculations below into several cases. In each case we
deal with @xmath even first and @xmath odd afterwards. Generally the
@xmath odd case is very similar to @xmath even, but there are occasional
complications. If a fusing matrix @xmath does not show up in the list
below for certain values of the chiral labels, then it is not allowed by
the fusion rules. We will also take canonical insertion points for the
correlators, so that we don’t need to write down the @xmath dependence
explicitly. Also, all free boson correlators that are used to determine
the orbifold ones have been checked for the conformal Ward identities of
[ 16 ] .

##### Case @xmath

To define these fusing matrices we take the gauge of [ 39 ] , which is
the one for which ( 7.8 ) holds. Such gauge is a convenient choice for
our case because the Frobenius-Schur indicator is always +1 in free
boson orbifolds. The result for @xmath is thus simply

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

This holds regardless of where the identity field is, e.g. @xmath , and
for both @xmath odd and even. This result can also be derived from the
three-point functions.

##### Case @xmath

For this case we need the correlator @xmath . It can be derived from (
7.15 ) by taking the following series of actions. Take @xmath , split
the correlator into chiral and anti-chiral parts, write the chiral
result in the form @xmath , take derivatives with respect to @xmath ,
set @xmath , take derivatives with respect to @xmath and finally take
canonical insertions points. After doing the above, we come to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

There is then only one conformal block. It is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

This block goes like @xmath , which from ( 7.6 ) confirms propagation of
the identity in the @xmath -channel. Having the block, we use the fusing
equation (repeated for convenience)

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

to derive the fusing matrix, which is simply

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

Again valid for all @xmath .

##### Case @xmath

Next we have matrices of type @xmath and permutations thereof. The
correlators relevant for this case involve free boson correlators of
type @xmath . These can be evaluated by the same method we used to
determine @xmath : differentiate the Koba-Nielsen chiral formula with
respect to @xmath , set @xmath to zero, differentiate with respect to
@xmath , push the insertions to the canonical points and finally impose
momentum conservation (this last step forces @xmath ). There are six
relevant correlators. Written as @xmath -channel expansions at canonical
insertion points they are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.22)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Outside the absolute square brackets we have the operator product
coefficients. (We have also abbreviated the chiral components of the
free boson field to @xmath ) The conformal blocks behave asymptotically
as expected, since every line in the @xmath -channel propagates at the
primary level. This result is used whenever there are correlators with
two @xmath fields.

The vertex operators for the orbifold @xmath conformal fields can, as
usual, be expanded into combinations of free boson vertex operators. We
will need orbifold correlators of type @xmath and permutations, so we do
the splitting and get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

(Note that labels @xmath and is the imaginary unit.) Here @xmath stands
for complex conjugate, e.g. a symmetric anti-holomorphic part for the
correlator. In principle we should also multiply this correlator by an
overall factor coming from the normalizations of the four fields, but
since we just want to compare the conformal blocks for this correlator
with the blocks for the correlator @xmath , this overall factor drops
out and can be ignored. We will neglect such overall factors
systematically in order to keep the notation as clean as possible. As we
see from expanding ( 7.23 ), the orbifold correlator @xmath indeed
reduces to a sum of free boson correlators (in this case, four of them).

##### Cocycle factors

The product of the two chiral halves in ( 7.23 ) looks to be nothing but
a simple factorization. However there is a slight complication. The
unextended free boson vertex operators @xmath are bosonic and should
thus commute. However, if we evaluate the operator product of @xmath and
compare it with the operator product of @xmath , we see they differ by
an overall factor @xmath . This factor can be removed by inserting
cocycle factors into the definition of the vertex operators [ 89 ] [ 90
] . Such cocycle factors are operators acting on a space of their own
and produce the minus signs needed to restore commutation of bosonic
vertex operators. There are many ways to represent them, but to cut a
long story short, here we simply take a Pauli @xmath -matrix
representation for them [ 91 ] . So we redefine our free boson vertex
operators as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

The numbers @xmath are the integers coming from @xmath and @xmath are
the usual Pauli matrices (not to be confused with the twisted sector
@xmath fields). Note that in the extended free boson theory we
reorganized the momenta such that the momenta of the primary fields is
@xmath , which makes @xmath , the winding number, zero. Thus in the
orbifold we only need to worry about cocycles when we deal with fields
@xmath , since these are the only ones with different left and right
momenta. (Eventually chiral descendants with @xmath would also need
cocycle factors, but we will not need those fields.) So, whenever we
encounter non-symmetrical chiral halves in correlators, we should insert
the above phases and Pauli matrices. Then we need to anti-commute the
@xmath matrices to the right at both sides of ( 7.2 ), so as to ensure
we are comparing equal things in the cocycle space. The net effect is to
change sums of factors into differences in some correlators. We will not
write down the cocycle factors explicitly in our formulas, but will
refer to them when needed.

On the first case at hand, @xmath , there is no chiral asymmetry and,
after applying momentum conservation to ( 7.23 ), we get the @xmath even
result

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.25)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

We notice that @xmath , otherwise the result vanishes. This is
consistent with the fusion rules for @xmath even. In the second line,
the winding number is @xmath for the second and third terms of the sum
and the cocycle factors for all the four terms are respectively @xmath .
All these products of Pauli matrices square to one, so even though in
principle we could have had cocycle factors, they turn out to be +1
here. This goes through for all other correlators with two @xmath and
two @xmath . Since all cocycle factors are +1, the four terms of ( 7.25
) are equal and the conformal block is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

This goes like @xmath , signaling propagation of the identity in the
@xmath -channel, as expected from the fusion rules for @xmath even. To
extract a fusing matrix we need the block for @xmath . With a
calculation similar to ( 7.25 ), it turns out to be

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

Asymptotics go like @xmath , signaling propagation of @xmath in the
@xmath -channel, again as expected from @xmath even fusion rules. From (
7.20 ) we can now determine the fusing matrix @xmath . The remaining
conformal blocks needed for the case @xmath and permutations are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using ( 7.20 ) we come to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

Remember this result is for @xmath even. For deriving the @xmath odd
result one must replace @xmath . There are no further subtleties and
after reevaluating the correlators and extracting the new conformal
blocks the result for @xmath odd is ( @xmath )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
                 (7.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is consistent with the fusion rules of @xmath odd.

##### Case @xmath

Next up we have type @xmath . Again we split the orbifold vertex
operators for @xmath into free bosons ones and using ( 7.22 ) we see
that the combinations are such that we get same conformal blocks as for
the @xmath case, but with @xmath replaced by @xmath . The final result
is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
                 (7.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since there are no @xmath fields here, this result is also valid for the
@xmath odd case.

##### Case @xmath

In this case several interesting features arise. We require @xmath ,
since @xmath leads to a different case. First we need the free boson
correlators @xmath , which again we can get by taking derivatives of the
Koba-Nielsen formula

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.32)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Let us look at the correlators we want to use. The orbifold correlator
@xmath can be expanded in the @xmath -channel. Now the following can
happen. The fusion rules are @xmath , so whenever @xmath , then @xmath
instead of @xmath . However, from ( 7.32 ) we see the conformal block
doesn’t care about this. Its asymptotics are always that of propagation
of a chiral field @xmath , whether or not it in fact exists. If it
doesn’t, the field that is truly propagating is @xmath , but at a
descendant level such that the asymptotics of the block it generates
match the result of the Koba-Nielsen formula. In general, the
asymptotics behavior of a conformal block allows for an integer @xmath
as follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

When dealing with pure Virasoro algebra @xmath is always zero, but in
extensions or whenever @xmath , it can happen that the integer @xmath is
larger than zero. Actually, since in an extended theory some fields that
were primaries prior to the extension eventually become descendants
afterwards, this is bound to happen.

Which gives rise to the following question. What happens to the
normalization of the conformal blocks if the intermediate state
propagates at the descendant level? If propagation is at the primary
level then the blocks can be normalized to 1, but if it is at descendant
level that may not be so. That is because we can only normalize
conformal blocks once. After that normalization is fixed, the
normalizations for the contributions of descendants are fixed uniquely
and cannot be set back to 1 ad libitum . In the case of descendants
propagation one needs pull the operator product coefficients of the
primary fields outside the conformal block. What remains is then the
true conformal block of the descendant. Explicitly, what we mean is that
if @xmath is a descendant of @xmath at level @xmath , the normalization
of a descendant block is [ 78 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

The @xmath coefficients can be determined from conformal invariance in
the general case [ 16 ] , but in the simple case of free bosons and
orbifolds thereof, they can be obtained explicitly from the operator
products. This remark is the key to the accurate derivation of the
fusing matrices when @xmath . If we naively normalize the descendants
blocks to 1, the fusing matrix starts depending on the descendant we
take. This is wrong since the fusing matrix is the same for all
descendants [ 76 ] .

Having settled block normalization, we can now use the information to
compute the @xmath fusing matrices. First we expand the orbifold
correlator @xmath into free boson factors

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.35)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Again there will be overall factors, but they won’t matter for
evaluating the fusing matrix. Momentum conservation demands that the sum
of the momenta of the various terms of ( 7.35 ) vanishes. The first term
does not contribute due to this. As for the other three, if one of them
conserves momentum, the remaining two will not. This allows us to split
the calculation into four sub-cases. First suppose @xmath . We have
three possibilities: @xmath . For @xmath only the last term of ( 7.35 )
contributes and using ( 7.32 ) the result is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

The conformal block is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

and has the correct asymptotics. To derive the fusing matrix we must
compare this with the block coming from the correlator @xmath . After
doing this we come to @xmath . There are also no subtleties with @xmath
, but when @xmath the matter is however different, due to propagations
at descendant level. In this case the relevant operator product
coefficient is @xmath . However, ( 7.32 ) still gives the same result as
( 7.36 ). Therefore, as stated above, we must pull this factor outside
the conformal block. So far so good, but now we see when @xmath there is
no way to achieve momentum conservation in ( 7.35 ) at the primary
level, so we must take a descendant field in one of the external legs of
the correlator in order to be able to extract a fusing matrix. The
easiest thing to do is to take a descendant of the extension current.
The first descendant with respect to the free boson extension currents (
5.11 ) has vertex operator @xmath . The free boson decomposition for
this descendant simply yields factors @xmath . Inserting these vertex
operators and their anti-holomorphic partners into ( 7.32 ) and pulling
out the primary operator product coefficient we come to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.38)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Inside the absolute square brackets we have the conformal block, which
as expected does not normalize to one:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

Extracting the fusing matrix is now simple. We get @xmath . Following
this method we can derive all the @xmath matrices

  -- -------- -------- -- --
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- --

This result valid for all @xmath . Note however that the above
expressions have an extra minus sign in the case where @xmath as
compared to what one would get from the naive calculation. These signs
do not follow from anything we said so far; they are appear because the
pentagon and hexagon identities cannot be solved without them.

##### Case @xmath

Again we expand the orbifold correlators into free boson ones and use (
7.32 ). Let us take the ordering @xmath . The expansion into free boson
factors is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

Notice that in going from the first to the second line all other
possible combinations vanish due to momentum conservation. This includes
the terms with different left and right chiral halves, which may have
led to cocycle factors. The conformal block is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

The other relevant blocks can be determined similarly. Then using ( 7.20
) we come to

  -- -- -- --------
           (7.43)
  -- -- -- --------

The result for @xmath odd actually turns out to be the same. After doing
the substitutions @xmath , expanding the correlators and suppressing the
vanishing terms we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

The factor @xmath is the operator product coefficient for @xmath , as
one can check by decomposing the orbifold fields into free boson
factors. Therefore the conformal block normalization is the same of
@xmath even and so is the result for the fusing matrices. The pentagon
and hexagon do not require any sign changes here.

##### Case @xmath

Here cocycles do play a role. To see this consider our first sub-case,
the @xmath correlator

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

In going from the first to the second line we applied momentum
conservation. Since the expression in the second line has terms which
are not left-right symmetric, one has to check for cocycles. The second
and fourth terms of the sum on the second line have both factors @xmath
. When we push @xmath through @xmath we get an extra sign @xmath , and
that the reason this factor appears in the last line. The conformal
block @xmath is just the quantity inside the absolute square and has the
correct asymptotics. Comparing it with the @xmath -channel blocks we get
a fusing matrix @xmath .

We can compare the result ( 7.45 ) with the tensor product of two Ising
models, to which extended orbifold theory is known to be equivalent at
@xmath . The double Ising correlator corresponding to ( 7.45 ) can be
evaluated straightforwardly using standard methods and blocks extracted.
For the same gauge choice, the fusing matrix is @xmath , so the cocycle
factor @xmath gives precisely the minus sign which necessary to make the
results of the two conformal field theories match.

The permutations of the @xmath correlator can also be calculated
similarly. For instance

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

The cocycles matrices are @xmath , so there are no sign changes in this
case. The conformal block is the quantity inside the absolute square
(divided by 2 when @xmath or by @xmath otherwise) and is to be compared
to the @xmath -channel result

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

This yields @xmath . Repeating the process for all cases we get for
@xmath even

  -- -- -- --------
           (7.48)
  -- -- -- --------

In the last two lines, @xmath . The @xmath odd result differs. Upon
substitution @xmath we get

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.49)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Since the factors @xmath turn out to be odd @xmath operator product
coefficients, the fusing matrices’ normalizations remain intact.
Ultimately, in the @xmath odd case the net effect of the substitution
@xmath is to interchange fusing matrices with @xmath for those with
@xmath and vice-versa. We could have also guessed this just by looking
at the @xmath odd fusion rules. The fusing matrices are then

  -- -- -- --------
           (7.50)
  -- -- -- --------

Again, in the second and third line @xmath . Solving the pentagon and
hexagon does not bring any sign flips.

##### Case @xmath

Here we can have again propagations at descendant levels. Cocycle
factors are trivial here because when we have only one field @xmath in a
correlator, the left and right chiral halves of left-right asymmetric
terms can never conserve momentum simultaneously. Expanding the
correlator @xmath we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

Suppose for instance that @xmath . Then @xmath and nothing more
contributes. Comparing with the @xmath -channel gives @xmath . This is
same every other case and the naive fusing matrix is simply 1 whenever
fusion is possible. But in this case the pentagon and hexagon equations
require some sign flips when there is propagation at descendant levels,
which in this case happens whenever @xmath or @xmath . The correct
result will depend on whether @xmath is even or odd. For @xmath even we
get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

And for @xmath odd

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

The permutations @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are similar, the field
taking the role of @xmath now being the one opposite @xmath .

##### Case @xmath

After expanding the vertex operators we get

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

All other terms vanish due to momentum conservation. Note also that
@xmath otherwise the correlator vanishes (which we can also see from the
fusion rules). There are no cocycles here because the left-right
symmetric terms contribute with cocycle matrix @xmath and, since @xmath
is even, the @xmath ’s coming from left-right anti-symmetric terms
commute. For @xmath odd there will be some cocycles though. The @xmath
even conformal blocks are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

leading to @xmath even fusing matrices

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

For @xmath odd we substitute @xmath . This leads to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.57)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

So we must see now how the cocycles change ( 7.2.2 ) for @xmath odd. In
this case we must pay attention when chirally asymmetric terms appear,
e.g. terms of type @xmath . Such terms can produce extra signs. We get

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.58)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Indeed we see minus signs appearing for @xmath and @xmath due to the
cocycle factors. Doing the sums to obtain the hatted fields of ( 7.57 )
we get

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.59)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The blocks coming from these correlators give rise to @xmath odd
matrices

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

And this is again left untouched by the polynomial equations.

##### Cases @xmath

So far the fusing matrices were 1x1. For the @xmath case they can and
will in general be larger than 1x1. The naive results will be valid for
odd and even @xmath , but there will be special cases involving chiral
fields @xmath , which obviously only exist in the @xmath even case.
Furthermore there are no cocycle factors, since we are dealing with
left-right symmetric vertex operators. Still, new features arise.

Expanding the orbifold correlator @xmath into free boson factors we get

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

So we have eight terms that may contribute. As we shall see, some
correlators have to be evaluated at descendant level and for this reason
the first term can sometimes contribute when one of the external legs is
a descendant field. In the following, we abbreviate @xmath by the charge
indices @xmath in order to keep the notation clean.

##### Case @xmath

In this case we have to distinguish two possibilities: @xmath and @xmath
. First take @xmath . After setting @xmath in ( 7.2.2 ) we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.62)
  -- -------- -- --------

For @xmath the fusion rule @xmath tells us what to expect in the @xmath
-channel. Getting the correct conformal block asymptotics requires a
rewriting of the correlator, so we use

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.63)
  -- -------- -- --------

With this we can reorganize the correlator and extract the conformal
blocks, which turn out to be

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.64)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

When @xmath the fusion is @xmath , so we would expect a conformal block
behaving as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.65)
  -- -------- -- --------

but the block extracted from the correlator always behaves as @xmath
regardless. This is again what we encountered before. If @xmath the
fusion, which should be into (the non-existent) @xmath , is actually
into a descendant of @xmath , at level @xmath . So, while the fusion
rule @xmath , the respective operator product coefficients only start to
be non-vanishing at descendant level @xmath . As we said above, in
principle one would need to absorb a descendant @xmath coefficient into
the descendant block, but in this case from the explicit operator
product expansion we see that @xmath . When writing the fusing matrix,
we take care of both @xmath and @xmath by writing @xmath , as in ( 5.16
). The fusing equation gives us a fusing matrix

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is valid for @xmath and all @xmath . (Rows and columns correspond
to the labels @xmath of @xmath .)

When @xmath is even, there is the extra case @xmath , for which the
fusion rules change. They are @xmath , so there there should be an extra
conformal block. The @xmath and @xmath blocks remain the same but the
block for @xmath is expected to split into two. However from the
explicit expression ( 7.62 ) the correlator remains the same, so we
conclude that the block

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

is in fact degenerate. Thus both @xmath and @xmath share the same
conformal block function. Due to this degeneracy, the fusing equation
cannot give us the exact form of the fusing matrix. For instance, we
cannot get more than @xmath and @xmath from it. We see no reason to
treat matrix elements involving @xmath and @xmath in a different,
non-symmetric way, like for instance @xmath , so we choose @xmath . At
present we don’t know of any way to lift this degeneracy, which appears
due to the chiral algebra extension. A comparison with fusing matrices
of the double Ising model also hints at a symmetric splitting, and this
also is why we choose this way to split the result. The pentagon and
hexagon will in the end tell us whether this way of splitting is
adequate or not. Also, at this stage we do not know anything about
matrix elements @xmath except that some of them must add up to zero. By
looking at the descendant correlator @xmath , we can improve on this and
get @xmath , although again with the assumption of symmetric splitting.
(Again, this matches the Ising squared result.) Putting together all
this information, we get to a candidate fusing matrix of

  -- -- -- --------
           (7.68)
  -- -- -- --------

And in the end this result does turn out to be the one that satisfies
the pentagon and hexagon identities. Also, these identities could not be
solved without the symmetric splitting assumption.

##### Case @xmath and permutations

We require @xmath . Starting with @xmath , we set the indices in ( 7.2.2
) and see we get something non-vanishing if @xmath . This signals
propagation of field @xmath in the @xmath -channel. The correlator is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.69)
  -- -------- -- --------

The propagating field @xmath has conformal block

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.70)
  -- -------- -- --------

To get fusing matrices we compare with

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.71)
  -- -------- -- --------

Blocks for the propagating field @xmath are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.72)
  -- -------- -- --------

The fusing matrix is then simply 1. This is however not the whole story;
there are three ways more to get a non-vanishing fusing matrix. First,
if @xmath there can be @xmath -channel propagation of @xmath at the
descendant level. Second and third, if @xmath there can be @xmath
-channel propagation at descendant level of either @xmath (when @xmath )
or @xmath (when @xmath ). For all these three cases we can take the
first extension descendant for @xmath , evaluate blocks for @xmath and
compare with blocks @xmath . We get the same @xmath in the end.
Precisely whenever descendants are propagating, the pentagon and hexagon
equations impose some sign changes here. In the end we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.73)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is also valid for any permutations of @xmath and for any @xmath .
Except for some special cases, in the matrix @xmath is in general 1x1.
Later on we will see that the result above is a part of the more general
result ( 7.95 ).

##### Case @xmath and permutations

Here the possibility @xmath leads again to different fusion and is
treated separately. Start with @xmath . Fusion is @xmath . We expect
thus three blocks, but in fact we have only two since propagation of
@xmath requires @xmath (already done) or @xmath (treated separately).
Setting indices in ( 7.2.2 ) we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.74)
  -- -------- -- --------

With reorganization of the absolute values we come to conformal blocks

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.75)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The fusion equation requires now @xmath for comparison. That turns out
to be

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.76)
  -- -------- -- --------

From the fusion rules we see that the fields propagating are @xmath ,
with blocks

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.77)
  -- -------- -- --------

The result stands for both @xmath and @xmath since the descendant
operator product coefficients are 1. The remaining case is @xmath ,
which gives

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.78)
  -- -------- -- --------

with conformal blocks

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.79)
  -- -------- -- --------

Extracting the fusing matrices for these three cases is straightforward.
We get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.80)
  -- -------- -- --------

with sign @xmath coming from imposing the pentagon and hexagons
identities.

For @xmath we have degeneracy of conformal blocks due to propagation of
both @xmath fields. In this case another interesting fact appears. Take

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.81)
  -- -------- -- --------

From the asymptotics we see that the blocks for @xmath and @xmath are
present but the block for @xmath turns out to be zero. This is
unexpected, but can perhaps be a consequence of level mismatches in the
towers of descendants that propagate coming from the left and right
vertices of the @xmath -channel. The existent blocks are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.82)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

For comparison with the @xmath -channel we need @xmath , which is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.83)
  -- -------- -- --------

The last term here is a degenerate conformal block for both @xmath .
Fusion is @xmath and blocks

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.84)
  -- -------- -- --------

For the last case @xmath we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.85)
  -- -------- -- --------

and blocks

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.86)
  -- -------- -- --------

By considering descendants correlators and assuming again a symmetric
splitting for @xmath we can set the overall normalization of the fusing
matrix elements and let the pentagon and hexagon fix eventual signs.
After doing all this we get for @xmath even

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.87)
     @xmath   @xmath               
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The @xmath odd result is similar, but has a few changes. Matrix @xmath
remains the same, whereas the other two change to (again @xmath )

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.88)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The sign @xmath comes again from solving the polynomial equations.

##### Case @xmath and permutations.

Most of the time only one field propagates in the @xmath -channel and
the fusing matrix is 1x1. For @xmath even we can have the special case
of @xmath , which gives a 2x2 matrix. If the matrix is 1x1, the result
is part of the more general result ( 7.95 ) for 1x1 matrices @xmath .
For the @xmath even special case @xmath the matrix is 2x2 and we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.89)
  -- -------- -- --------

The conformal blocks are again degenerate

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.90)
  -- -------- -- --------

For comparing with the @xmath -channel blocks we need @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.91)
  -- -------- -- --------

From which the conformal block is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.92)
  -- -------- -- --------

so from the asymptotics we see that the field @xmath propagates at the
descendant level. Using ( 7.20 ) and once again considering descendants
correlators and symmetric @xmath splitting, we get

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.93)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Following the same procedure for all permutations we get

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.94)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Where again some of these signs are set by the pentagon and hexagon.

##### Case @xmath

In most cases where @xmath is allowed by the fusion rules, only one term
survives in ( 7.2.2 ) and the corresponding fusing matrix is naively 1.
Imposing the pentagon and hexagon leads to sign flips. To express these
the following is needed. In the @xmath -channel conformal blocks the
couplings @xmath and @xmath are at stake. For the @xmath -channel we
have at stake @xmath and @xmath . Let us define an order for the
couplings; call @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath the first, second,
third and fourth coupling respectively. Now, if the fusion rules allow a
1x1 fusing matrix @xmath , then the labels @xmath of the fields @xmath
propagating in the @xmath - and @xmath -channels are defined uniquely by
@xmath . We call a coupling @xmath ‘primary’ (type P) if @xmath or
@xmath , and ‘descendant’ if @xmath (type D). With couplings ordered as
above, for a 1x1 matrix @xmath the extra signs then behave as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.95)
  -- -------- -- --------

(We could have also written @xmath for DDPP and @xmath for PPDD, which
is an equivalent statement.) Given any six labels @xmath leading to a
1x1 matrix @xmath , the four couplings will always fall into one and
only one of the cases above. The result ( 7.95 ) is valid for any @xmath
and for any labels @xmath that generate a 1x1 matrix. (So for instance
the cases @xmath and @xmath and permutations thereof are automatically
included in ( 7.95 ).)

When @xmath take special values, the fusing matrices enlarge. This
happens for @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . The correlator for the first
case, @xmath and @xmath , is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.96)
  -- -------- -- --------

Only the @xmath are propagating because @xmath forbids @xmath from
propagating. The degenerate blocks are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.97)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is to be compared the @xmath -channel blocks coming from

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.98)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here the propagating fields should be @xmath , but like in the @xmath
case, one of them does not propagate when all the external legs are at
the primary level. The for the propagating block is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.99)
  -- -------- -- --------

By considering descendants correlators, we would come to the impossible
fusing matrix of

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.100)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This clearly cannot be the correct answer since it is not invertible.
The solution is to insert a minus sign in one of the matrix elements.
The same happens for @xmath , which would appear to have all elements
equal to @xmath . As usual, we let the pentagon and hexagon set the
signs that are necessary. This time the extra signs will not only solve
the pentagon and hexagon equations, they will also make the fusing
matrices invertible. Solving for @xmath even we get

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.101)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

For @xmath odd we have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath               
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.102)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

again with @xmath the fields of type @xmath propagating in the @xmath
and @xmath channels.

The calculation of the fusing matrices for the untwisted sector is
complete. The set of fusing matrices ( 7.17 - 7.102 ) is the solution.

##### Braiding eigenvalues

The set of signs @xmath are the remaining piece of data necessary for
determining the braiding matrices. Define ‘free boson charge’ @xmath as
@xmath . For the fusing matrices above, the pentagon and hexagon
equations are solved for

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.103)
  -- -------- -- ---------

With this, all fusing and braiding matrices for the untwisted sector are
determined.

#### 7.2.3 Discussion of results

As we have seen, it is not possible to arrive at the correct form of the
duality matrices solely by extracting orbifold conformal blocks from its
correlators and comparing them in the various expansion channels. To get
the complete result we resorted to solving the pentagon and hexagon
equations, with the gauge freedom of @xmath fixed. As can be seen from
the fusing matrices and associated fusion rules, the sign flips that
turned out to be necessary are all related to descendant propagation.
This hints at the extension being responsible for the subtleties that
force these sign changes, which cannot be sorted out at the level of
conformal blocks. When all indices of @xmath come from primary fields of
the extended theory, the naive results require no changes on the fusing
matrix and can therefore be trusted. In looking for more solutions to
the polynomial equations, we did not allow for changes in these signs in
the numerical calculations.

An analysis of the problem of how exactly the extension works at the
chiral algebra level and at conformal block level might give answers to
questions like where do the descendant signs come from and how can one
calculate them, or how can one resolve the problem of conformal block
degeneracy when two conjugate fields propagate in the correlator channel
expansions. Some steps towards this end have been taken in [ 39 ] ,
although it is yet too soon to advance solutions. The complete result
for @xmath and @xmath is essentially unique, since all the possible sign
changes coming from the pentagon and hexagon are gauge-related. The fact
that every one of the equations was verified up @xmath is strong
evidence for the correctness of our results. We have also verified the
one-loop constraint ( 6.9 ) held for @xmath .

While the results for the duality matrices are not enough to verify all
the sewing constraints, a subset can immediately be checked for the
Cardy modular invariant of the orbifold. In the Cardy case @xmath , it
was noticed by [ 38 ] and [ 77 ] that if one writes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.104)
  -- -------- -- ---------

then, using the symmetries of the boundary operator product
coefficients, he can check that duality of the boundary four-point
function becomes the pentagon identity [ 84 ] . Having found a set of
untwisted fusing matrices that satisfies the pentagon identity is then
also a proof that the orbifold untwisted sector satisfies the boundary
four-point sewing constraint for the Cardy case.

### 7.3 Fusing matrices for the mixed sector

We now calculate fusing matrices involving chiral fields from the
twisted sector. These divide into two cases: mixed and (pure) twisted.
In the mixed sector we have correlators with two untwisted fields and
two twisted ones (correlators with an odd number of twist fields vanish
due to the fusion rules) and in the twisted sector we have correlators
with four twisted fields. In this section we study mixed correlators and
in the next section we present results for the twisted sector. Results
will not be complete because the correlators involving twisted @xmath
fields are not readily available. Nevertheless it is useful to cover
some ground by calculating a few correlators involving @xmath fields and
see what problems and subtleties arise. Mixed correlators were studied
in [ 82 ] [ 90 ] and twisted correlators in [ 74 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] .

To derive mixed fusing and braiding matrices one needs the explicit
conformal blocks for the mixed sector. The canonical mixed correlator
reads [ 82 ] [ 90 ]

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.105)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This correlator has an extra factor @xmath as compared to [ 82 ] . That
factor is necessary to give the correct conformal weights to the
intermediate states propagating and the correct asymptotics to the
conformal blocks [ 90 ] . Also, the difference in the exponents of (
7.105 ) with respect to [ 82 ] is related to the choice of @xmath ,
which affects the normalization of the twisted sector mode expansions.
In [ 82 ] @xmath whereas here @xmath .

The fusion rules determine for which @xmath and @xmath the correlators
are zero/non-zero. With some algebra we can also derive correlators for
the remaining mixed cases with the twisted fields in other positions
other than the first and fourth and for the other types of untwisted
fields. For briefness we concentrate on the case @xmath only.

If we decompose ( 7.105 ) into conformal blocks in the @xmath -channel
we get, since @xmath (with @xmath or 2 depending on the fusion rules),
two blocks

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.106)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The blocks @xmath and @xmath must have @xmath asymptotics @xmath and
@xmath respectively. In ( 7.105 ) we have two terms, but if we try to
identify each of them with a conformal block, we get the wrong
asymptotics. Some reshuffling is thus needed. Using

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.107)
  -- -------- -- ---------

we can rewrite ( 7.105 ) as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.108)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which have the correct @xmath asymptotics. The operator product
coefficients are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.109)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The natural choice for the @xmath coefficient is then @xmath .

#### 7.3.1 Braiding matrices

We are now ready to pick ( 7.108 ) and insert them in ( 7.2 ). We can
derive braiding matrices. The equations to solve are (assuming @xmath )

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
                       @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.110)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

Inserting ( 7.108 ) in the above equalities and taking principle values
for the square roots we see that the powers of @xmath nicely cancel out,
leaving us with

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Pushing the factor @xmath to the left-hand-side and abbreviating @xmath
@xmath we get for @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.111)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Squaring the above equalities, we see that they are satisfied by a
braiding matrix

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.112)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This solution reduces for @xmath to the result one would get from the
tensor product of two Ising models [ 76 ] . For @xmath odd one must
replace the twist fields with the appropriate complex combinations and
re-calculate the braiding.

The simplest hexagon equations are inversion relations. Since the
braiding above matrices above satisfy the first hexagon equation for
eigenvalues @xmath and @xmath , and since there are no extension
problems in the twist-twist-untwist couplings, it is likely that all
@xmath and @xmath are +1.

### 7.4 Fusing matrices for the twisted sector

Calculation of the orbifold four twist fields correlators was originally
done in [ 82 ] and [ 83 ] . The technique used there was lifting the
four-point function on the sphere with four insertions to its double
cover, a torus with four insertions, so that the multi-valuedness
behaviour of the free boson field around twist fields vertex operators
insertions disappeared and the result became single-valued. The details
of the calculation are however intricate and therefore we willl write
down the results only. With some reshuffling to get to our conventions,
the result of [ 82 ] and [ 83 ] is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.113)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath denote @xmath twist fields. Careful with the notation now:
@xmath is defined mod 2, and @xmath corresponds to @xmath and @xmath to
@xmath . So for instance @xmath means @xmath .

The parameter @xmath is redefined as @xmath , with @xmath the modulus of
the double cover torus. This modulus can be rewritten as @xmath , with
the complete elliptic functions [ 92 ] and @xmath the generalized theta
functions

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.114)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with the classical Jacobi @xmath functions @xmath defined as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and @xmath the @xmath function with zero-mode removed [ 92 ] .

Other combinations of twist fields yield vanishing correlators due to
the fusion rules. Correlators with @xmath as the first field are
obtained by replacing @xmath . (This dihedral symmetry was noticed in [
83 ] .) Being essentially a computation on the torus, it is not
surprising to see a sum over lattice momenta arising. The theta function
argument @xmath will play no role in the following, so we will skip it
from now on.

The result ( 7.113 ) follows our conventions with @xmath and world-sheet
spatial parameter running from 0 to @xmath . It was obtained from [ 82 ]
by redefining the Hamidi-Vafa compactification radius such that @xmath .
The world-sheet dilation then brings @xmath . The correlator turns out
not to be invariant under the @xmath duality transformation @xmath . The
reason for this was explained in [ 73 ] . Because of it, one has to
specify which range of @xmath he takes and here we pick again the
non-equivalent radii @xmath . When we do this, we must take a final step
of substituting @xmath in the expression of [ 82 ] for the four-twist
correlator. After all this is done we come to ( 7.113 ).

Note also that this four-twist correlator holds for an unextended
orbifold theory. To get a result for the extended orbifold requires some
manipulations so that the lattice momenta in the summations come to a
finite sum.

##### Equivalence to the Ising squared model

An interesting cross-check is to see whether in the case of @xmath ,
where the orbifold is equivalent to the tensor product of two Ising
models, these complicated-looking expressions for four-twist correlators
yield the same result as the straightforward Ising squared calculation.
The Ising squared field @xmath (in the usual Ising notation) corresponds
to the orbifold @xmath twist field. At canonical insertions its
four-point correlator is simply

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.115)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

This should be the same result as the orbifold correlator with @xmath in
( 7.113 ). We get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.116)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Now we use the identity @xmath and rewrite the sums over @xmath and
@xmath to come to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.117)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Note that in this form the exponents of @xmath are those of an
extension, so we are in fact dealing with an extended orbifold theory.
The sums are now the theta functions @xmath , which we can relate to
combinations of other theta functions. When we do this, we get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.118)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This looks very different from ( 7.115 ), but when we make use of the
so-called ‘Inversion Problem’ relations [ 92 ] @xmath on ( 7.115 ), we
see that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.119)
  -- -------- -- ---------

thus confirming that the two theories are indeed the same.

#### 7.4.1 Twisted conformal blocks

The next step is now to express the correlator in terms of conformal
blocks

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.120)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Being a rational conformal field theory, the orbifold four-twist
conformal blocks must have a finite sum over @xmath , so we need to
reshuffle the theta-functions. The manipulations that lead to fusing
matrices are different for even and odd @xmath .

#### 7.4.2 Case @xmath even

We start with the @xmath even case. Do the following steps in ( 7.120 ):
pull out a @xmath factor from the brackets on the exponential, redefine
@xmath , split the @xmath sum @xmath , redefine @xmath . After doing
this we come to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.121)
  -- -------- -- ---------

With this the sums have been decoupled and can now be written as
absolute values squared. Now we write @xmath , @xmath . From the general
definition of theta-functions we get

  -- -- -- ---------
           (7.122)
  -- -- -- ---------

We now split the various cases @xmath .

##### Case @xmath

Take @xmath . Here we simplify ( 7.120 ) further as follows. Note that
@xmath . With this we can write

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.123)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The three sets of theta-functions signal emergence of three types of
conformal blocks. Let us check the asymptotics to see which fields are
propagating in the @xmath -channel. If @xmath , @xmath , so we can
expand ( 7.123 ) in @xmath . We get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.124)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This is consistent with propagation of the fields @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath ( @xmath for @xmath even, @xmath for @xmath odd), the
normalization factors being the inverse of the OPE coefficients. The
fusion rules are @xmath , so asymptotics are consistent with what we
expected to be propagating. Finally we can write an explicit expression
for the conformal blocks of @xmath even, @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
                 (7.125)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The operator product coefficients follow from our choice of
normalization of the conformal blocks. Since we chose to normalize
conformal blocks to one, these turn out to be

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.126)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

We see that the operator product coefficients are powers of 16, as was
also noted in [ 83 ] .

The next step is to compare the blocks at @xmath and @xmath to extract
the fusing matrices via @xmath . Going from @xmath to @xmath means going
from @xmath to @xmath . This leads to three sets of equations, each one
for @xmath , @xmath and @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

At first sight it seems rather difficult to find matrices @xmath
relating theta-functions at @xmath and @xmath , but this can be done as
follows. Note the following equality defining the @xmath -matrix of a
free boson theory

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.128)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which can be proven taking a Fourier tranformation of the
left-hand-side. With some reshuffling we can rewrite ( 7.128 ) as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.129)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Since in ( LABEL:Nevenr0s0fusing ) @xmath is even, we can use ( 7.129 )
on it. The factors @xmath drop out and using also @xmath , we simplify (
LABEL:Nevenr0s0fusing ) to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
                 
                 
                 
     @xmath      (7.130)
                 
                 
     @xmath      
                 
  -- -------- -- ---------

Due to ( 7.129 ) these equalities hold for a fusing matrix

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.131)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We can check the first hexagon equation here. If we assume @xmath the
first hexagon reduces to @xmath for matrices of type @xmath . Since we
conjecture @xmath , we have to check this matrix squares to one, which
is indeed so.

##### Case @xmath

Now let us look at the @xmath case. From the fusion rules, the same
@xmath should be propagating in the @xmath -channel. However from (
7.120 ), the block for @xmath is @xmath . The vanishiment of this block
is needed, as we shall see. Using @xmath , the @xmath correlator can
then be rewritten as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.132)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Studying the asymptotics we come to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.133)
                 
  -- -------- -- ---------

The operator product coefficients are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.134)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

(The coefficient @xmath cannot be derived from @xmath , but we already
know it from @xmath .) The equation defining the fusing matrix for this
case is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.135)
  -- -------- -- ---------

so we need to study the @xmath case to proceed.

##### Case @xmath

From the fusion rules, the fields propagating in @xmath ¹ ¹ 1 We
occasionally abbreviate @xmath by 1,2, which should be clear from the
context. are @xmath . Noting that @xmath we can rewrite ( 7.120 ) as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.136)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This has exactly the same number of fields propagating as @xmath ,
namely @xmath of them. That is why the block @xmath vanishes: if it were
not so, then the dimension of the space of conformal blocks of @xmath
would be bigger than that of @xmath . The asymptotics yield

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with operator coefficients

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.138)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The fusing matrix equation is now known. It is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
                 
                 
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.139)
  -- -------- -- ---------

To solve this, we can use the following identity, derived again from
Fourier transformations

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Comparing this with ( 7.139 ) we conclude that the fusing matrix is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.141)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The fusing matrix @xmath is just the inverse of this matrix (due to the
hexagon). We will however derive @xmath explicitly from the conformal
blocks. This will serve as a check that we have the correct matrix.

The equation defining the fusing matrix for this case is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.142)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This leads to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.143)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- ---------

We now use the (by now familiar) Fourier equality

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Comparing the above with ( 7.4.2 ) we come to the fusing matrix

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Because of the hexagon relation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

( LABEL:F2211 ) should be the inverse of ( 7.150 ), which can checked to
be so.

##### Case @xmath

The final case is @xmath , which will give us @xmath . Here we expect
the fields @xmath to propagate in the @xmath -channel. Using @xmath we
get from ( 7.120 )

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.146)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The asymptotics as @xmath behave as expected. We get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.147)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The fusing matrix equation @xmath leads to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.148)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The Fourier equality to use is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Comparing this with ( 7.148 ) gives us the fusing matrix

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.150)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The hexagon here is again @xmath , which can be checked to be so.

#### 7.4.3 Case @xmath odd

This case has subtlety that the true twist conformal field is not @xmath
but a complex combination of the two. One way to see this is to note
that the correlator @xmath for arbitrary @xmath is like a partition
function, a real number. It is also an unextended theory object, which
doesn’t discriminate between @xmath ’s. Thus it is insensitive to the
fact that the twist fields are complex for @xmath , @xmath odd.
Therefore the @xmath that enter the four-twist correlator are not the
true conformal fields. As it was noted before in ( 5.15 ), the true
twist conformal field is the combination @xmath .

Since we are after @xmath , we have to evaluate the appropriate linear
combinations. Using the dihedral group symmetries to get correlators
with @xmath we get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.151)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- ---------

We now specify ( 7.120 ) to the @xmath odd case. To simplify this
expression we do the following steps. Pull a factor @xmath out of the
square, split @xmath into odd and even contributions, resum over @xmath
, split again @xmath into odd and even contributions and finally resum
over @xmath . The result is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.152)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- ---------

Note that this isn’t even an object of type @xmath , but that is because
it is not a true correlator. Some manipulations are needed to rewrite
this expression as a sum of squares of conformal blocks. Taking specific
@xmath and ignoring the conformal prefactor for the moment, we come to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.153)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- ---------

with

  -- -------- -------- -- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath         
     @xmath   @xmath         (7.154)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- ---------

It doesn’t look like ( 7.152 ) leads to this result for @xmath and
@xmath , but one can prove it using the following equalities

  -- -------- --
              
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Taking the appropriate linear combinations ( 7.151 ), the true
correlators are

  -- -------- -------- -- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath         
     @xmath   @xmath         (7.155)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- ---------

The sums and differences of theta-functions look strange but can be
simplified using the equalities

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.156)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

(The phase factors above disappear in the absolute squares.) Restoring
the conformal factors, the true correlators then simplify to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.157)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- ---------

And in this form we explicitly see the expected behaviour @xmath . Now
the asymptotics can be checked. Let us first do @xmath . The
Theta-functions behave as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.158)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The fusion rules are @xmath , but the field @xmath cannot propagate due
to fusion at the right-hand vertex of the correlator, so only the @xmath
fields propagate. The asymptotics are consistent with propagation of
fields @xmath , of which there are @xmath of, exactly as many terms as
the corresponding expression ( 7.157 ) consists of. Evaluating the
normalizations we get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.159)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The blocks for @xmath are similar, but in addition we have a block for
@xmath , which can now propagate. The asymptotics and normalizations
lead to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.160)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- ---------

Now we look for the blocks of @xmath . The theta-functions behave as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.161)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The fusion rules are @xmath . The @xmath term is the identity block and
other @xmath -terms have the asymptotics for propagation of @xmath .
Checking the normalizations we get

  -- -------- -- ---------
                 
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.162)
                 
  -- -------- -- ---------

The blocks for @xmath are similar, namely

  -- -------- -- ---------
                 
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.163)
                 
  -- -------- -- ---------

With all blocks under control, we can determine the fusing matrices for
@xmath odd.

##### Equivalence to the free boson

We can check the conformal block formulas by comparing the orbifold
result for @xmath with its equivalent theory, the extended free boson
with @xmath theory. Fields in the circle theory are characterized by
their momentum @xmath , @xmath with conformal weights @xmath . The field
correspondence is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The free boson four-point correlators on the diagonal invariant are
given by the Koba-Nielsen formula

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.164)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Taking canonical insertions this leads to

  -- -- -------- -------- -------- ---------
        @xmath   @xmath            (7.165)
                 @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -- -------- -------- -------- ---------

The orbifold result should reproduce this. The @xmath -terms in ( 7.157
) all vanish and we are left with the classical theta-functions only. We
have then

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.166)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The results match, as expected. Had we not taken the complex
combinations @xmath there would be no way to make the equivalence work.

The final simplification one can do is to substitute @xmath in the
conformal blocks. Doing this leads to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
                 
     @xmath      (7.167)
                 
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- ---------

These are precisely the same blocks of the @xmath even case, but with
some labels swapped.

Having the conformal blocks, the next step is to extract the fusing
matrices. Since the blocks are the same as @xmath even, the fusing
matrices are also the same. The only subtlety is the zero-block of
@xmath of @xmath even, which is moved into a different correlator in
@xmath odd.

##### Case @xmath

The fusion rules here are @xmath , but, as we saw before, the @xmath
field cannot propagate. The fusing equation is @xmath , and leads to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.168)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Using the Fourier equality

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.169)
  -- -------- -- ---------

we come to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The hexagon is @xmath which holds, since it is the same as the @xmath
even case.

##### Case @xmath

The fusion rules are now @xmath . The equation for the fusing matrix is
@xmath . This leads to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.171)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- ---------

The Fourier equality to use is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.172)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which gives a fusing matrix

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.173)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The hexagon is again @xmath , which holds.

##### Case @xmath

The fusing equation is @xmath , leading to

  -- -- -------- -------- --
        @xmath   @xmath   
                 @xmath   
        @xmath   @xmath   
                 @xmath   
  -- -- -------- -------- --

Using the Fourier equality

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

(pick @xmath for the first line of ( 7.4.3 )) we get

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

##### Case @xmath

The last fusing equation is @xmath , which leads to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.177)
                                @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath                     
                       @xmath            
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

The Fourier equality is here

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.178)
  -- -------- -- ---------

from which we get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.179)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- ---------

The hexagon is @xmath and it holds. If one had the mixed correlators
with @xmath fields, the hexagons could be used to determine fusing
matrices @xmath with two or four @xmath ’s.

## Chapter 8 Outlook

The quest of describing the macroscopic world and the microscopic world
in a unified framework is perhaps the greatest theoretical puzzle since
the events that preceded the discovery of Quantum Mechanics and
Relativity. The challenge and renown of discovering a grand unified
theory attracted many scientists to the field but the task turned out to
be formidable indeed. There is not yet a convincing theory of quantum
gravity, although many proposals have been advanced. String Theory is
the most promising candidate for such a realization. A spectrum with
gravitons and good ultraviolet behavior indicates it may very well be a
step in the right direction.

String Theory is a fascinating subject. It is so comprehensive and
widespread that it stimulates a lot of active research in many branches
of Physics and Mathematics. Finding the path from the critical ten
dimensions down to four is one of the main goals of string phenomenology
and it should at least hint strongly towards correctness or not of
String Theory itself. In this thesis we explored how one can start the
reduction of dimensions in a consistent way by studying algebraic
theories that are equivalent to compactification of one dimension. This
was done in the context of open string theories, following the algebraic
approach.

Open string theories have a much richer structure as compared to closed
ones. The appearance of extra features on the world-sheet, such as
boundaries and crosscaps, makes it an interesting challenge to try and
understand the mechanics of the conformal field theory living on it.
Geometrically, the boundaries introduce D-branes and crosscaps introduce
orientifold O-planes. The presence of such objects in an open string
theory allows for quite some flexibility in devising phenomenological
scenarios. The brane world scenarios, for instance, are a very
interesting idea based on D-branes whose test may even be within
experimental reach. Black-hole geometries are another idea based on
D-branes that is currently undergoing a lot of research. Open string
theories are in any case part of the web of string dualities and
therefore an essential piece fitting in the M-theory puzzle. They are by
themselves a worthy object of pure research, and their relevance in
various models is added motivation for their study.

Open strings come hand-to-hand with orientifold planes. The O-planes are
necessary to restore consistency of the total theory, both at space-time
and world-sheet level. Orientifolds project some states out of the
theory and therefore gives rise to unoriented string theories. From the
phenomenological side, O-planes have been used to construct novel
cosmological scenarios [ 93 ] .

The open descendants construction allows one to build an open string
theory starting from a closed string one. This requires us to first
search for a parent closed string theory, from which the open strings
will descend. In the algebraic approach, this amounts to finding a
conformal field theory model with modular invariant torus partition
function. Then we must define the states that describe a boundary or
crosscap, which is done via linear combinations of closed string
Ishibashi states. Closed string scattering between boundary and crosscap
states can then be calculated and that provides us the Klein bottle,
annulus and Moebius strip. After taking due care with orientation
matters, transforming the result to the open string channel provides us
with the unoriented closed and open string partition functions.
Partition functions count states, so requiring positive and integer
state degeneracies becomes the first consistency conditions on the open
string theory.

Positivity and integrality are very restrictive requirements with which
a lot can be done. They were applied in this thesis to extended free
boson orbifold theories, which correspond to compactifications on line
segments. The orbifold torus partition function changes according to the
free boson compactification radius. When the radius is integer, the
modular invariant is a simple current invariant, for which the boundary
and crosscap coefficients were derived in [ 27 ] . If the radius is
rational the invariant is exceptional, which was the case in this
thesis. Nevertheless the positivity and integrality requirements turned
out to be enough to postulate a consistent set of boundary and crosscap
coefficients.

The positivity and integrality constraints on one-loop partition
functions are a necessary consistency requirement for open string
theories. Necessary, but not sufficient. Consistency of the string
perturbative expansion requires a check at all orders, not just at
one-loop. The sewing constraints’ inductive mechanism gives us a set of
equations which, when satisfied, guarantee that sewing two world-sheet
topologies together will yield a consistent theory in the sewn surface,
in the sense that it will be unambiguous and that it will have the
correct factorization properties.

Checking the sewing constraints requires specific data from the
conformal field theory on the world-sheet. This data includes
model-dependent quantities like operator product coefficients, conformal
block functions and duality matrices, which are often hard to get since
they require solving complicated differential equations for correlation
functions. In the free boson orbifold case the task of obtaining the
correlation functions is tractable because it is a simple model. The
untwisted sector of the orbifold has vertex operators that are
combination of free boson ones and therefore the untwisted orbifold
correlators are combinations of free boson correlators, which are known.
Part of the twisted sector correlators are also known, and with all this
one can derive some of the quantities needed to check the sewing
constraints.

On this thesis, we concentrated on deriving the orbifold fusing and
braiding matrices. These matrices have a pivotal importance in the
sewing constraints, since all of the constraint equations depend on them
explicitly. They are exchange matrices that interpolate between the
various channel expansions of closed string correlation functions. The
duality matrices are themselves also constrained by the pentagon and
hexagon identities, two identities derived from alternative but
equivalent ways of writing the conformal blocks the matrices relate. For
conformal field theories with charge-conjugation modular invariant, the
fusing matrices turn out to be equivalent to the boundary operator
product coefficients, a simplification that leads to equivalence of the
boundary four-point function sewing constraint to the pentagon identity.
Finding a set of fusing matrices is then equivalent to solving one of
the sewing constraints for a class of conformal field theories.

From the correlation functions for the orbifold untwisted sector one
could extract the conformal blocks and from there the fusing and
braiding matrices could be obtained. This procedure brought however some
unexpected surprises. The orbifold theory has extended symmetries in its
chiral algebra and this brings up a few features that are usually not
present if one considers the Virasoro algebra alone. Existence of chiral
fields of equal conformal weights is one of the possible complications
at the level of conformal blocks and this does indeed happen for the
orbifold. Because of it ambiguities arise in comparing conformal blocks
to obtain the duality matrices. Understanding how can one relate the
conformal blocks by means of duality matrices in the presence of
extended chiral algebras is an interesting problem to be investigated.

In practice what happened in the orbifold case was that the naive
calculations produced the correct result for duality matrices up to
signs. It was then possible to resort to the pentagon and hexagon
identities to find a solution for the fusing and braiding matrices with
correct signs and to check it was correct up to @xmath and that it was
essentially unique. For the mixed and twisted sector, fusing matrices
were derived from the correlators involving twisted @xmath fields, with
which some of the hexagon identities could be solved. A full check of
the whole orbifold pentagon and hexagon identities can be done once the
correlators involving twisted @xmath fields are available. The set of
untwisted fusing matrices is however already a good start for proving
consistency of free boson orbifold theories since it is automatically
the solution of one of the sewing constraints.

The stage is then set for the first thorough study of open string
consistency to all orders in perturbation theory. When done, it will
reassure us that compactifications are indeed consistent and that String
Theory rests on solid grounds.
