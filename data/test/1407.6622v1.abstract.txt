Moreover, three appendices are included at the end of the thesis. App. A
reports the Feynman rules for diagrams. App. B provides the
demonstration of the effective operators defined in Chap. 3 . App. C
gives complete details on the construction of the density-dependent
potential from the 3NFs contributions at N2LO.
