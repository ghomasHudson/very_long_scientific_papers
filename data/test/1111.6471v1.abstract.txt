During the Sixties of the last century the search for a mathematically
rigorous formulation of quantum field theory has begun. One of the first
and most prominent successes in this area is due to the algebraic and
axiomatic approach proposed by Haag and Kastler (refer to [ HK64 ] ).
This formalism allows the definition of quantum field theory over
Minkowski spacetime in a precisely specified mathematical context,
namely the algebraic one, and the natural implementation of the notions
of causality and Lorentz covariance in such theory.

We specify that this approach does not produce a new theory with respect
to the original formulation of quantum field theory on Minkowski
spacetime. On the contrary it gives rise to equivalent results, yet
presenting two significant advantages: in first place the theory is
formulated in a precise mathematical context, that allows to motivate
rigorously the results one obtains, and in second place the approach
proves suitable to remarkable extensions. As a matter of fact over the
years the original ideas of Haag and Kastler were significantly
developed and went through an enlargement of their range of
applicability, while largely preserving their original identity, until
the formulation of quantum field theory on curved spacetimes.

Almost 40 years after the work made by Haag and Kastler, Brunetti,
Fredenhagen and Verch ( [ BFV03 ] ) proposed a new approach to quantum
field theories on curved spacetimes named generally covariant locality
principle . On one hand this approach is to be considered as
complementary to the original one since it does not add new axioms to
the theory and allows the natural recovering of the algebraic and
axiomatic approach by Haag and Kastler. On the other hand it has the
merit of highlighting the common aspects of quantization procedures on
different spacetimes (namely the underlying functorial structure) and
the distinguishing features (namely state spaces). Furthermore the
functorial structure of this approach naturally implements covariance in
quantum field theories, as it is expected by each physical theory
according to general relativity.

In this thesis the generally covariant locality principle is presented
in a general setting. It postulates that each quantum field theory be
formulated as a locally covariant quantum field theory (sometimes
denoted by the acronym LCQFT ). Without pretending to be exhaustive, we
may say that a LCQFT consists of a covariant functor mapping each
globally hyperbolic spacetime to an algebra and each isometric embedding
between two globally hyperbolic spacetimes to an injective homomorphism
between the algebras associated to such spacetimes. Other two properties
can be required to a LCQFT : causality , which, simplifying, means that
elements coming from two algebras associated to spacetimes isometrically
embedded in causally separated subregions of a common spacetime commute,
and the time slice axiom , which requires that each homomorphism
associated to an isometric embedding whose image includes a Cauchy
surface of its codomain be surjective.

We repeat that general covariance is implemented in the theory as a
consequence of the covariance property of the functor giving rise to a
locally covariant quantum field theory . Following what was shown by
Brunetti, Fredenhagen and Verch, we present the proof of the fact that,
starting from a LCQFT fulfilling both causality and the time slice axiom
, it is possible to recover the Haag-Kastler scheme, involving nets of
local algebras and covariant automorphisms associated to isometries of
the underlying spacetime. This fact makes it possible to interpret a
proper subalgebra of the algebra provided by a LCQFT on a given
spacetime as the algebra of physical observables associated to that
spacetime.

The approach to quantum field theory suggested by the generally
covariant locality principle is completely independent of the specific
physical model considered from time to time, yet we must check the
possibility of realizing a locally covariant quantum field theory
fulfilling both causality and the time slice axiom in each situation of
physical interest in order to have a physically relevant principle. In
this thesis the results obtained in [ BFV03 ] for the Klein-Gordon field
are recovered and the cases of the Proca and the electromagnetic fields
are discussed. We take the chance to remind that the case of the Dirac
field was handled in [ San10b ] .

As we will see, the construction of a locally quantum field theory for a
bosonic field actually relies only on the possibility of building a
symplectic space of solutions for the classical field equations for each
globally hyperbolic spacetime and on the specification of a symplectic
map for each isometric embedding between two globally hyperbolic
spacetimes, the domain and codomain of the symplectic map being the
symplectic spaces associated to the domain and codomain of the given
embedding. As for the causality property and the time slice axiom of a
LCQFT built in this way, again the problem is reduced at a classical
level to a matter of support for solutions of Cauchy problems for the
field equations and to the surjectivity of the symplectic maps.

The main purpose of this thesis is to study a particular type of
dynamics proposed by [ BFV03 ] named relative Cauchy evolution (briefly
RCE ). The distinctive feature of the RCE relies in its ability of
highlighting the sensitivity of a locally covariant quantum field theory
to fluctuations of the metric of the underlying spacetime. In particular
our aim is to study a relation between the RCE and the stress-energy
tensor for the LCQFTs built for the Klein-Gordon field, the Proca field
and the electromagnetic field. The interest in such relation arises from
the intention of including the expectation value of the stress-energy
tensor of a given quantum field in the right hand side of the Einstein’s
equation (for further details on the semiclassical Einstein’s equation
we refer to [ Wal94 ] ).

Following the definition recently proposed by Fewster and Verch in [
FV11 ] , only for those locally covariant quantum field theories
fulfilling the time slice axiom , we define the relative Cauchy
evolution as an automorphism on the algebra associated to a given
globally hyperbolic spacetime induced by a local perturbation of the
spacetime metric. The definition of the RCE suggests its interpretation
as a dynamical reaction of the quantum field theory to a fluctuation of
the metric of the underlying spacetime. We will re-examine some
properties of the RCE with particular attention to its insensitivity to
perturbations of the metric induced by diffeomorphisms and to the fact
that, consequently, the functional derivative of the RCE with respect to
the spacetime metric has null divergence.

In [ BFV03 ] the relative Cauchy evolution for the Klein-Gordon field is
thoroughly analyzed. In particular Brunetti, Fredenhagen and Verch were
successful in showing that in this case a particular relation between
the RCE and the stress-energy tensor holds. Here we re-examine this case
as an example and we have as our goal to extend to the cases of the
Proca and the electromagnetic fields the relation between the RCE and
the stress-energy tensor proved in [ BFV03 ] for the Klein-Gordon field
(for the similar problem in the case of the Dirac field we refer again
to [ San10b ] ). In this way the meaning of the RCE in relation to the
stress-energy tensor is extended from the case of the Klein-Gordon field
to the Proca and the electromagnetic fields. In particular this fact
motivates the insertion of the expectation value of the stress-energy
tensor on the right hand side of the Einstein equation for the Proca and
the electromagnetic fields too.
