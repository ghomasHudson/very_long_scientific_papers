In this thesis, we consider domino tilings of three-dimensional regions,
especially those of the form @xmath . In particular, we investigate the
connected components of the space of tilings of such regions by flips,
the local move performed by removing two adjacent dominoes and placing
them back in the only other possible position. For regions of the form
@xmath , we define a polynomial invariant @xmath that characterizes
tilings that are “almost in the same connected component”, in a sense
discussed in the thesis. We also prove that the space of domino tilings
of such a region is connected by flips and trits, a local move performed
by removing three adjacent dominoes, no two of them parallel, and
placing them back in the only other possible position. For the general
case, the invariant is an integer, the twist, to which we give a simple
combinatorial formula and an interpretation via knot theory; we also
prove that the twist has additive properties for suitable decompositions
of a region. Finally, we investigate the range of possible values for
the twist of tilings of an @xmath box.
