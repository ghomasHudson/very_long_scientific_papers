It is straightforward to check that this is in fact a representation,
using @xmath .

Finally, we use the abstract index presentation of the representations
to show that contraction commutes with the group action. A simple case
suffices, so we avoid a profusion of indices. Suppose @xmath . Then
@xmath acts on @xmath to give @xmath . Contracting on the indices @xmath
and @xmath , we obtain

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

This is exactly the result we would obtain contracting first and then
acting by @xmath . The general case, with arbitrarily many indices, is
much the same.
