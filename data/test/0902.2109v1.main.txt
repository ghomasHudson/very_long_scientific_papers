## Introduction

String theory was born to describe strong interactions. The intuitive
idea is still valid today. In the IR the hadrons in the nucleus get
extremely coupled and if we try to separate two quarks a tube of color
form between them. It has the tension proportional to its length and
indeed it behaves essentially as a string. Because the elementary quarks
are not observable at low energies, these stringy degrees of freedom
would give the correct effective description of the strong interactions
in the far IR. This approach reproduce some nice features of the
hadronic spectrum, but was definitively surpassed by the advent of the
QCD, that seems to describe, in a coherent picture, the strong
interaction as a quantum field theory.

After that first stop string theory left its original purpose and
re-propose itself as the theory of everything. Namely as the only theory
that could in principle unify all the interactions we know in a coherent
picture, and explain every kind of phenomena as the result of some
simple elegant postulates. Indeed at the base of string theory there is
just the idea of giving a quantum mechanical description of the general
covariant dynamics of extended objects. Starting with this logic, and
some simple assumptions, it is possible to show that string theory is
rich enough to contain the Standard Model and to unify it with an in
principle consistent theory of quantum gravity. Even more string theory
seems to have not any free parameters and to be unitary and finite at
least at the perturbative level. All these properties seem miraculous
and gave the starting point to a full fledged investigation.

After a lot of years of very intensive research string theory reveals as
a very hard beast. We do not even had a real definition of the theory
and its celebrated uniqueness is basically lost in the very hard problem
of finding the right vacuum describing our world. But we don’t need to
lose our enthusiasm, this theory is full of surprises and it is able to
regenerate it self from its dust. Indeed, thanks to the discovery of new
non perturbative degrees of freedom, first of all D branes [ 1 ] , there
were many new progresses. These news ingredients changed forever our
point of view about string theory: it is no more a theory of one
dimensional objects but contains in itself the spectra of all possible
dimensional extended objects, like branes. A D brane in first
approximation is a minkowski hyperplane embedded in the ten dimensional
stringy space time. The interesting properties of D branes is that they
are charged under the RR form fields of the perturbative strings and a
supersymmetric gauge theory lives on its world volume. Using D branes it
is possible to reproduce very interesting phenomenological models, study
the microscopic origin of the black hole entropy, giving in this way a
window over quantum gravity, study non perturbative corrections to
string theory compactifications, or to gauge theory dynamics, and
formulate the AdS/CFT correspondence [ 2 , 3 , 4 ] . Indeed regarding to
this last topic we can claim that sometime the history seems circular
and looking into the future you can see your past. Today we believe that
string theory is still able to teach us many things related to the
strongly coupled regime of field theory that in many cases is not
accessible in any other way!

More than ten years ago the AdS/CFT conjecture was formulated in the
context of the modern string theory [ 2 , 3 , 4 ] , and definitively
realized the idea that the geometry, and in particular the string
theory, could be the correct description for the strongly coupled regime
of quantum field theories. The AdS/CFT correspondence tells that, in
some way, the degrees of freedom of a flat non gravitational gauge
theory, in the strong coupling IR regime, reorganize themselves into the
degrees of freedom of a ten dimensional string theory on some specific
background. This conjecture is formidable and very powerful. One can
make prediction on the far IR quantum regime of a gauge theory doing
essentially classical geometric computations. The actual formulation of
the AdS/CFT makes use of D3 branes in flat space time, and in its
generalizations, of D3 branes placed on some particular singularities [
5 , 6 , 7 ] .

Along this thesis we will mainly focalize on the study of D3 branes in
the kind of setup nearer to the AdS/CFT correspondence. Namely we will
consider N D3 branes at the CY conical singularity @xmath . The low
energy dynamics of D3 branes at @xmath is a quiver gauge theory [ 8 ] :
a UV free field theory that flows in the IR to a superconformal fixed
point; it has gauge group @xmath , chiral bifoundamental matter fields,
and a particular form for the superpotential. As we will see this setup
is very rich and it has at least two main applications: local
construction for model building, and study of strongly coupled field
theories using the AdS/CFT correspondence. The first application is
mainly due to the fact that the structure of the field theory on D3
branes at singularities is rich enough to give a big variety of
interesting gauge theory dynamics and naturally contains chiral fields
fundamental for any phenomenological applications, moreover it is
flexible enough to skip some global consistency conditions required by
effective compactifications. The second application is based on the fact
that the AdS/CFT tells that the field theory living on @xmath D3 branes
at the @xmath singularity is dual ( in a strong/weak coupling duality
sense ) to type IIB string theory propagating on the @xmath background
with @xmath .

In both cases the central topic is the study of gauge theory phenomena.
In this thesis we will be humble and we will concentrate on the super
conformal case, but it is possible to analyze also the non conformal and
non supersymmetric case using a similar setup. As usual to go far we
need first to learn how to move some easy steps, and we will see that
there are many things to say and to learn even in this rather simpler
SCFT case.

In the recent years there were a lot of efforts to construct the
dictionary between the geometrical singularity and the gauge theory.
This dictionary is very well understood in the toric case [ 9 , 10 , 11
, 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 ] , namely when the singularity
@xmath admits at least a @xmath isometry. We will not spend too much
time to illustrate the very interesting problem of constructing gauge
theories at singularities. What is important for us is that, at the end
of the day, we obtain a superconformal field theory that is described in
the UV as a quiver gauge theory with some specific form of the
superpotential: every bifundamental field appears in the superpotential
just two times: one time with the positive sign, the other time with the
negative sign. Our main interest will be to study some supersymmetric
properties of these theories.

Once we have a supersymmetric field theory the first information we
would like to obtain is the structure of its vacua. Supersymmetric field
theories indeed usually have a manifold of vacua called the moduli space
@xmath and the study of these varieties is of fundamental importance to
understand the dynamics of the theory. Another very important subject is
the study of the degrees of freedom of a theory, and in particular of
its BPS operators, namely operators that preserve half of the
supersymmetries of the theory. In this thesis we will be interested to
study the moduli space, and the spectrum of BPS operators of gauge
theories living of stacks of N D3 branes at singularity @xmath . We will
learn a lot of properties about these two subjects and in particular
their relations, namely how to get informations about one of the two
once we have enough informations related to the other [ 20 , 21 , 22 ,
23 , 24 , 25 , 63 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 ] . To study these topics we
will introduce the concepts of Master Space, Hilbert Series and
Plethystic Exponential. We will learn soon to appreciate their
properties, but let us now start with some basic facts.

There are a set of nice properties of this kind of setup that will make
easier our analysis. A first crucial observation is that at least a part
of the moduli space of the gauge theory is explicitly realized in the
geometry. Indeed some of the scalar degrees of freedom parameterizing
the moduli space @xmath must also parameterize the space transverse to
the branes. In the abelian case we just have one D3 brane and it is just
a free point in the transverse geometry, hence the moduli space of the
theory must contain at least the six dimensional singularity @xmath . In
the generic non abelian case we have N D3 branes that, being mutually
supersymmetric, will behave as a set on N non interacting particle on
@xmath . Because the ground state of the D3 branes is bosonic we have a
system of N bosons and the non abelian moduli space must contain the N
times symmetric product of the transverse singularity: Sym @xmath ,
where @xmath is the group of permutations of N objects acting on the N
factors @xmath . Another nice property is that the gauge theories on D
branes at singularities have in principle a natural gravity dual that
describe the strong coupling regime of the field theory, and this could
help to interpolate from strong to weak coupling.

These nice properties are a good starting point to begin our study about
the complete moduli space @xmath and the complete chiral ring of these
theories.

The moduli space @xmath of a supersymmetric gauge theory is given by the
vanishing of the scalar potential as a function of the scalar components
of the superfields of the field theory. This, in turn, is the set of
zeros of so-called D-terms and F-terms , constituting a parameter, or
moduli, space of solutions describing the vacuum. It is a standard fact
now that @xmath can be represented as the symplectic quotient of the
space of F-flatness, by the gauge symmetries provided by the D-flatness.
We will denote the space of F-flatness by @xmath and symmetries
prescribed by D-flatness as @xmath , then we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (0.0.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

@xmath is called the master space and, as we will see all along this
thesis, it is a parent space from which we can obtain a lot of
informations regarding the moduli space @xmath .

We will start to fully characterize the moduli space of gauge theories
for branes at singularities in the abelian case. With just one brane we
are left with a set of @xmath groups, hence the gauge dynamics of the
theory is trivial and @xmath . The master space @xmath describe the
complete moduli space of the theory and contains as a sub set ( the
locus where all the baryonic operators have zero vacuum expectation
value ) the geometrical six dimensional transverse singularity @xmath .

The complete moduli space is some sort of @xmath fibration over @xmath
with the action induced by the baryonic symmetries:

-   @xmath is generically a @xmath dimensional toric variety, and can be
    completely characterized in term of algebraic geometry. Indeed we
    will see that @xmath is generically reducible in

    -   a @xmath dimensional component @xmath that is a toric Calabi Yau
        cone,

    -   and a set of lower dimensional generically linear components
        @xmath .

We will illustrate the properties of @xmath with examples and with the
use of some mathematical theorems.

The natural and subsequent step is to analyze the non abelian case. In
the non abelian case the equations describing the master space @xmath
get very quickly extremely involved, and on top of this fact, the gauge
dynamics is highly non trivial. For these reasons we miss a clear direct
description in term of algebraic equations and we need to look for other
tools to get informations. It is easy to see that the moduli space for
@xmath is in general no more toric and Calabi Yau. This two facts
complicate enormously the direct analysis, and hence the idea will be to
follow the algebraic geometric paradigm: the set of holomorphic
functions over an algebraic variety completely characterize the variety
itself. This means that if we are not able to analyze the variety
directly we can extract all the informations we need studying the
spectrum of holomorphic functions over it.

The set of holomorphic functions over the moduli space is exactly the
set of all 1/2 BPS operators of the gauge theory. We want to construct a
function that encode all the informations of the chiral ring of the
theory. We proceed in the following way. The gauge theory has
generically @xmath global abelian symmetries: @xmath coming from the
isometries of @xmath , they are the flavor and R symmetries of the field
theory, and they are generically called mesonic symmetries; @xmath
baryonic symmetries: anomalous and non anomalous, coming from the @xmath
factors inside the @xmath of the UV description of the quiver gauge
theory (the total diagonal @xmath is always completely decoupled), whose
gauge dynamics decouple in the IR superconformal fixed points. We want
to realize a function that counts the BPS operators according to their
charges under these various @xmath . Let us introduce a set of @xmath
chemical potentials @xmath with @xmath . We would like to have a
function that once expanded for small values of the chemical potentials

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (0.0.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

gives the numbers @xmath of BPS operators with charges @xmath under the
corresponding global abelian symmetries. This function is called the
Hilbert series of @xmath .

The holomorphic functions on the moduli space are the BPS operators of
the gauge theory and we could try to construct these functions directly
in field theory. We will give some examples of this construction, but it
is worthwhile to say immediately that this way to proceed has two
important drawbacks: the actual computational power is highly restricted
by the increasing of the complexity of the operations with the increase
of the number of colors N; and it gives back the classical, weak
coupling spectra of BPS operators of the theory, while we know that the
gauge theory is generically in strongly coupled fixed points.

To solve the computational problem and to try to obtain informations in
the strongly coupled regime of the field theory we will analyze the dual
stringy description following the AdS/CFT correspondence. The AdS/CFT
proposes a one to one map between the operators in the gauge theory and
the stringy states in the @xmath background. To get ( 0.0.2 ) in the
strong regime we need to find all the states dual to the complete
spectrum of BPS operators in gauge theory. It come out that to every BPS
operators one can associate a quantum state of a D3 brane wrapped over a
three cycle in H. If the three cycle is trivial the corresponding
operator will be a mesonic operator, namely it will have charge zero
under all the @xmath baryonic symmetries; if the three cycle is non
trivial the associated operator is a baryonic operator. There exist an
infinite number of states of D3 branes wrapped in H. Indeed every
section of every possible line bundle over @xmath individuates a
suspersymmetric embedding of a D3 brane, while, through the geometric
quantization of the system, the N times symmetric product of these
sections, modulo the specification of a flat connection over the three
cycle, is a state of D3 brane dual to a BPS operator. We will show how
to explicitly construct all these states and how to obtain from them the
partition function counting all the BPS operators of the gauge theory in
the strongly coupled regime.

The basic idea is the following. It is possible to show that the
knowledge of the abelian @xmath case is enough to obtain the Hilbert
function for the generic non abelian @xmath case. In the @xmath case we
need to count sections over the transverse space @xmath . These are
infinite in number, because the manifold is non compact, and are
topologically distinguished by the baryonic numbers @xmath in the field
theory. Hence the @xmath partition function admits a decomposition in
sectors having a different set of baryonic charges:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (0.0.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

@xmath are the number of BPS operators associated to the same
geometrical cycle: multiplicities. They are related to the possible set
of flat connections that one can turn on the cycle. @xmath count the set
of sections of the line bundle with topology given by @xmath and
weighted by their charges under the isometries of @xmath . We compute
the multiplicities @xmath with the use of some combinatorial techniques
in the field theory, while @xmath is obtained applying some index
theorems to the bundles on @xmath .

We will learn that these partition functions contain a lot of
informations related to the CY singularity @xmath :

-   @xmath , the mesonic partition function, contains the structure of
    the algebraic equations defining the variety @xmath ;

-   from @xmath , for generic @xmath , we can obtain the volume of H,
    and for @xmath the volumes of all the possible non trivial three
    cycles @xmath in H.

They contain even important informations related to the gauge theory:

-   @xmath , and in general @xmath , contain the structure of the
    generators and the relations in the chiral ring for different
    numbers of colors;

-   @xmath contain the value of the central charge and of the various R
    charges of the field theory at strong coupling. These are related by
    AdS/CFT to the volume of H and to the volumes of the three cycles
    in H.

The problem of counting chiral operators is influenced by the
multiplicities problem: namely by the fact that to every geometrical D3
brane state in string theory correspond more than one operator in the
gauge theory. We will need to put a lot of effort to solve this
multiplicity problem. Along this way we will find a rather surprising
relation between the baryonic numbers and the kahler moduli of the
geometry. Pushing on this relation we will be able to give a precise
prescription to compute complete BPS partition functions for a generic
toric conical CY singularity.

Afterward we want to pass to the generic @xmath non abelian case. This
is in principle a non trivial step, because it introduces in the game
non abelian dynamics, and non trivial algebraic relations among the
operators. The fundamental observation is that looking at the gravity
side, or at the explicit construction of the BPS operators, it is
possible to see that to pass to the generic N case we just need to
construct the partition function counting all the possible N times
symmetric products of the functions counted by @xmath . This is
essentially due to the fact that the operators for finite @xmath are
symmetric functions of the operators for @xmath . There exist a
function, called the plethystic exponential PE, that exactly play this
role: it takes a generating function for a set of operators and it gives
back a function that counts all the possible symmetric products of the
operators counted by the input function.

The Hilbert series counting the BPS operators for arbitrary number
@xmath of branes is obtained from ( 0.0.3 ) applying the PE to every
fixed @xmath sector:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (0.0.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the Hilbert series counting the BPS operators for N D3
branes. We have in this way developed a procedure to construct partition
functions counting BPS operators for arbitrary number @xmath of branes.
This ability gives us new tools and a new point of view towards the
study of the moduli space for generic N.

The non abelian moduli space is indeed very complicated and a direct
attack to the problem seems quite hard. All along the history of physics
the search for symmetries was a guide line. Indeed the search for
symmetries will be our guide line in the study of the moduli space
@xmath . It turn out that the Master Space @xmath for just one D3 brane
has some symmetries not manifest in the UV Lagrangian describing the
field theory; we call them Hidden Symmetries. These symmetries are
typically non abelian extensions of some anomalous or non anomalous
baryonic @xmath symmetries. The symmetries of the moduli space @xmath
can be naturally study with the help of the Hilbert series that we have
just described. Indeed we will show that It is possible to reorganize
the spectrum of BPS operators in multiplets of the Hidden Symmetries in
such a way that the Hilbert series for the @xmath moduli space will be
explicitly written in term of characters @xmath of these symmetries.
This fact imply that all the BPS operators comes in representation of
the symmetries. Now we know how to pass from the one brane case to the
generic number of branes N. If we are able to reorganize the generating
functions @xmath for the non abelian case in representations of the
global symmetries guessed form the abelian case, we can show that the
complete moduli space @xmath for generic @xmath has the Hidden
Symmetries of the @xmath Master Space @xmath . Indeed in a case by case
analysis it is possible to show that if we introduce a set of chemical
potentials @xmath , @xmath parameterizing the Cartan sub algebra of the
Hidden Symmetries group, it is sometimes possible to rewrite the
generating function @xmath in such a way that it will have a nice
expansion in character of the Hidden Symmetries:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (0.0.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

When this happens, it means that the non abelian moduli space is
invariant under the Hidden Symmetries group.

Let us try to summarize where we are. We tried an alternative algebraic
geometrical approach to four dimensional @xmath supersymmetric field
theories. We make strong use of the concept of Master Space, Hilbert
Series and Plethystic Exponential. For the specific setup of D3 branes
at CY singularities we got as a result the complete control over the
spectrum of BPS operators and its symmetry properties for generic N; the
complete description for the moduli space for one brane, and interesting
properties for generic N.

Due to the success of this approach it is natural to wonder about
possible generalizations. We will describe only some generalizations
while many other are present in literature, and we will comment about
them in the conclusions.

Till now we focalized our attention to the scalar sector of the BPS
operators. One possible extension is to try to construct partition
functions counting all the supersymmetric degrees of freedom of the
theory including the non bosonic ones. One of the reasons for this
extension could be the recently proposed black holes solutions in @xmath
space time [ 32 , 33 ] . If we believe that string theory can give a
microscopical explanation of the entropy of such black holes, It is
natural to look for the counting of degrees of freedom of some kind of
dual gauge theory. To take into account the entropy of such black holes
we presumably need to count also non 1/2 BPS operators, but for the
moment we will just try to count at least all the chiral operators. To
get the partition function counting all the BPS operators we need to add
the fermionic degrees of freedom to our previous counting, namely we
need to make use of the superfield strength @xmath associated to the
gauge fields. We will see that this can be done in a rather systematic
way, generalizing the formalism just proposed to some kind of superfield
formalism, and taking into account the mixed bosonic/fermionic statistic
to go from @xmath to generic @xmath .

Another possible extension is to try to understand what happen to the
moduli space of a gauge theory and to its chiral ring when the gauge
theory is marginally deformed. Indeed all the theories living on branes
at singularities have generically a manifold of fixed points. This means
that the superconformality conditions imposes some constrains on the
coupling constants that can be solved locally in term of a subset of all
the coupling constants. The SCFT just described correspond to the more
symmetric point in the conformal manifold. One can move along this
manifold of conformal fixed points turning on some marginal operators in
the superpotential. The marginal operators preserve the
superconformality of the gauge theory, the values of the central charge
and of all the R charges of the theory, but they generically break part
or all the global symmetries, and turn on non trivial field
configurations in the gravity dual. The result is the modification of
both the moduli space and the chiral ring. A marginal deformation common
to all these toric gauge theories is the so called @xmath -deformation.
In this case the insertion of marginal operators in the gauge theory
always preserve a @xmath isometry and it is seen in the dual gravity
setup as the presence of non trivial fluxes. These fluxes act as a
potential on the system of D3 branes and they drastically change the
moduli space and the structure of the chiral ring of the gauge theory.
Let us summarize what happen to the mesonic moduli space. In the
undeformed case the @xmath mesonic moduli space is the transverse CY
singularity @xmath , while in the case in which @xmath is an irrational
number the mesonic moduli space is just a set of complex lines. For
rational values of @xmath the @xmath mesonic moduli space becomes the
@xmath quotient of the original @xmath singularity. The set of BPS
mesonic operators will be the set of holomorphic functions defined on
these varieties, and it change discontinuously with @xmath .

Along the thesis we will also make some comments about the use of the
Master Space and the Hilbert Series to study seiberg or toric dualities.

There are of course a lot of other possible extensions to the concepts
and techniques we introduce in this thesis and we will comment about
some of them in the conclusions.

### Structure of the Thesis

The thesis is structured as follows.

In the chapter 1 we give a short pedagogical introduction to the topic
of branes at singularities. We will use as examples the easy case of
@xmath and the conifold. We will introduce some concepts of toric
geometry, brane tiling, AdS/CFT, and we will give a quick overview of
the mesonic moduli space and the related counting problem of mesonic
operators. We will finally define the PE function and explain some of
its basic properties.

In chapter 2 we study the moduli space @xmath for @xmath brane. In
particular we will study its reducibility properties, its CY conditions
and the structures of its Hilbert series. We will give different types
of description of @xmath : explicit, toric, using dimer techniques, and
linear sigma models. We will give some orbifold and non orbiford
examples and we will analyze some properties of their IR flows.

In chapter 3 we study the problem of counting BPS operators looking to
the dual stringy states. We realize a one to one map between the
baryonic operators and the D3 brane states in the geometry. We learn how
to construct the partition functions with fixed baryonic charges and how
to obtain from them the volume of the horizon manifold H and of all the
non trivial three cycles @xmath inside H, and hence the value of the
central charge and of all the R charges in field theory.

In chapter 4 using the field theory intuition we will construct the
first complete partition functions counting operators according to all
their charges, baryonic and mesonic. Using the example of the conifold
we will study some properties of the moduli spaces and the chiral rings
for different values of N.

In chapter 5 we will put together the abilities developed in the last
two chapters and we will formulate a general recipe to obtain complete
partition functions for every toric quiver gauge theory. This general
proposal strongly relies on a correspondence between the Kahler moduli
of the geometry and the baryonic numbers of the field theory. We give
some explicit examples and we match the results between the gravity and
the gauge theory computations.

In chapter 6 we go back to the problem of studying the moduli space
@xmath for generic number of branes N. In particular, using the Hilbert
series associated to @xmath , we will be able to show that the fully non
abelian moduli spaces have some non abelian hidden symmetries for
generic N.

In chapter 7 we explain how to add the fermionic BPS operators to the
previously obtained Hilbert series, and we will give a recipe to
construct the Hilbert series counting all the possible BPS operators of
the field theory.

Finally in chapter 8 we study how the mesonic moduli space and the
mesonic chiral ring are modified if we marginally deform the gauge
theory.

## Chapter 1 Branes at Singularities

The discovery of D branes revolutionized our understanding of String
Theory. D branes are promising tools for model building, holographic
correspondences, geometry, gauge theories, and many other topics.

Local analysis, namely D branes in non compact space, is a good
laboratory to study all these topics, ant it is also very well motivated
by the AdS/CFT correspondence. Indeed the local setup can be seen as the
first step to construct a global consistent model. Even more in the
local setup, thanks to the AdS/CFT correspondence, we have some control
on the strong dynamics of the system.

We are interested in the dynamics of the low energy degrees of freedom
of N D3 branes in non-compact setup: namely extending in four flat
minkowski space time directions and transverse to a non compact six
dimensional variety @xmath . Their low energy degrees of freedom is a
special class of gauge theories called quiver gauge theories.

### 1.1 Generalities: @xmath and the Conifold

The easiest example of this kind of setup is a stack of N D3 branes in
the flat space time i.e.: @xmath . It is well known that their low
energy dynamics is described by the @xmath supersymmetric @xmath gauge
theory. In the language of @xmath supersymmetry this theory contains one
@xmath vector superfield and three chiral superfields @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath in the adjoint representation of the gauge group, interacting
through the superpotential:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The D3 brane behaves like a point in the transverse space @xmath . Being
point like implies that the low energy space time dynamics of the brane
is sensible only to the local geometry of the six dimensional space
@xmath . Indeed the low energy dynamics of a stack of N D3 branes in
@xmath , when @xmath is a smooth manifold, is still @xmath
supersymmetric @xmath gauge theory. To obtain more interesting dynamics
in this setup, we are forced to consider singular varieties. We are
indeed interested in studying the properties of a stack of N D3 branes
at conical Calabi Yau ( CY from now on) singularities @xmath . CY
because we want to have at least @xmath supesymmetry, and conical
because we want a conformal field theory. A D3 brane at singularity
fractionates in a system of @xmath fractional branes whose low energy
dynamics is described by a @xmath gauge theory with chiral
bifoundamental fields that are the zero mass modes of the strings
stretching between the various fractional branes. These gauge theories
are called quiver gauge theories and they have an easy graphical
representation [ 8 ] . For every gauge group factor draw a node while
for every bifoundamental field draw an arrow with the tail on the node
under which the field transform in the fundamental representation, and
the tip on the node under which the field transform in the
anti-fundamental representation, see Figure 1.1 .

These theories are UV free and flow in the IR to a superconformal fixed
manifold. The diagonal @xmath gauge factor is completely decoupled and
there are no chiral fields charge under its action. Along this flow the
other @xmath @xmath factors of the gauge group decouple and remain as
global baryonic symmetries, anomalous and non anomalous, in the IR,
where the Super Conformal Field Theory ( SCFT from now on ) have gauge
group @xmath .

One easy and very well known example is the conifold singularity @xmath
[ 34 , 7 ] . This is a six dimensional singularity described by the
quadric @xmath in @xmath . This space is singular and has an isolated
singularity at the origin of @xmath . A D3 brane at the conifold
singularity fractionates into two fractional branes that forms the
physical D3 bound state. Indeed the low energy dynamics of a stack of N
D3 branes at @xmath is given by an @xmath supersymmetric gauge theory
with gauge group @xmath , bifoundamental fields @xmath , @xmath with
@xmath transforming as shown in the quiver (Figure 1.1 ), and
superpotential:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The conifold is a real cone over the the coset space @xmath , where the
@xmath is the diagonal @xmath contained into the two @xmath : @xmath .
The field theory has the global symmetry @xmath , under which the fields
@xmath transform as @xmath and have charges @xmath , @xmath ; while the
fields @xmath transform as @xmath and have charges @xmath , @xmath ; and
the superpotential ( 1.1.2 ) is invariant.

We refer to the literature the reader interested in the dictionary
between the low energy dynamics of N D3 brane and the conical CY
singularity @xmath [ 5 , 7 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 ,
12 , 18 , 35 ] . It is enough to say that in the case in which the
singularity @xmath is toric, meaning that it has at least @xmath as
isometry group, the dictionary to pass from the singularity to the gauge
theory is well under control [ 13 , 11 ] . The gauge theory is a quiver
gauge theory of the type previously explained, and it has a specific
form for the superpotential: all the bifundamental fields appear exactly
two times, one time with the plus sign and one time with the minus sign.
In what follows we will give more details about these types of gauge
theories.

To give a feeling that the gauge theories proposed are reasonable, and
to get familiar with these theories, there exist an intuitive test. As
already explained a D3 brane is a point in @xmath and being a physical
brane it can move all along @xmath . Namely due to supersymmetry the D3
branes do not feel any forces along its transverse directions. On the
other end the transverse degrees of freedom of a D3 brane are the scalar
fields living on the brane constrained by their four dimensional
interactions encoded into the action of the SCFT. The scalar fields are
the lowest components of the chiral superfields in the theory, and their
constraints are given by the superpotential and the gauge interactions,
namely the F terms and the D terms flat conditions of the SCFT. Hence
the vacua of the theory (moduli space), or at least a subset, must
reproduce the transverse space @xmath . The transverse space is a
physical quantity and to describe it we need to fix the gauge redundancy
i.e. we need to form gauge invariant combinations of the elementary
chiral fields and then impose the superpotential constrains.

Let us see how it works in the two easy example just explained. Let us
consider the case with a single @xmath D3 brane: the gauge theory is
abelian and its gauge group is the product of @xmath factors. We want to
show that the D3-brane probes the Calabi-Yau singularity @xmath . For
@xmath SYM in the case @xmath the superpotential is trivial and the
three fields @xmath , @xmath , @xmath are c-numbers and they are
unconstrained by the supersymmetric conditions, giving a copy of @xmath
. Also for the conifold the superpotential is trivial in the case @xmath
and hence the four fields @xmath , @xmath are four unconstrained
c-numbers: the coordinates of @xmath . We can now construct the four
gauge invariant mesonic operators @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath . In
the case @xmath the trace is trivial and the four operators are not
independent but subject to the obvious relation @xmath . This is indeed
the equation of the conifold singularity where the D3 brane lives.

For the generic number of colors N what happens is still intuitive. A
single D3 brane is a free point probing the singularity @xmath , N
parallel D3 branes are mutually supersymmetric and do not feel any
interactions among themselves, hence they behaves as @xmath free
particles on @xmath describing @xmath copies of @xmath . Because the
ground state of the D3 is bosonic it implies that the system of @xmath
free particles on @xmath is a bosonic system and its ground state is the
N time symmetric product of @xmath : Sym @xmath , where @xmath is the
group of permutation of N objects acting on the N copies of @xmath .

It is easy to see in the gauge theory that this is indeed the case. For
@xmath SYM the F-term equations read

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

These are the equations for three @xmath matrices, meaning that we can
simultaneously diagonalize the fields @xmath , @xmath , @xmath . Their
eigenvalues are unconstrained and, taking the quotient by the remaining
Weyl group, not fixed by the diagonalization, we obtain that the moduli
space is Sym @xmath .

For the conifold the F-term equations are:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (1.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

we can define four composite mesonic fields which transform in the
adjoint representation of one of the two gauge groups

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and consider the four mesons @xmath as @xmath matrices. We could use the
second gauge group without changing the results. With a simple
computation using the F-term conditions ( 1.1 ) we derive the matrix
commutation equations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (1.1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and the matrix equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.1.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which is just the conifold equation. All the mesons commute ( 1.1 ) and
the @xmath matrices @xmath can be simultaneous diagonalized. The
eigenvalues are required to satisfy the conifold equation ( 1.1.7 ) and
therefore the moduli space is given by the symmetrized product of @xmath
copies of the conifold Sym @xmath , as expected.

In the remaining sections of this chapter we will use the two examples
we have just introduced: @xmath , and the conifold @xmath , to
illustrate some generic features of gauge theories on D3 branes at
singularities. In section 1.2 we explain the link between D3 branes at
singularities and the @xmath correspondence. In section 1.3 we give some
basic notions of toric geometry, and in section 1.4 we summarize the
generic features of the gauge theories living on D3 branes at toric CY
singularities. In section 1.5 we illustrate some aspects of the mesonic
moduli space and of the mesonic chiral ring. We introduce the Hilbert
series, as interesting tools to study the chiral ring and the moduli
space, and we define and give the basic properties of the plethystic
exponential PE.

### 1.2 Branes at Singularities and the AdS@xmathCFT Correspondence

The setup of branes at singularity is very useful for many theoretical
and phenomenological applications: going from model building to the
study of strongly coupled gauge theories. In particular with the AdS/CFT
tools we can rewrite the gauge theory on the N D3 branes as a string
theory in certain ten dimensional space time background. In principle it
is possible to rewrite the non perturbative dynamics of the gauge theory
as the dynamics of classical supergravity, and the non perturbative
quantum dynamics of string theory as the weak coupling perturbative
dynamics of the gauge theory. As we have already explained we are
interested in singularities @xmath that are conical singularities, this
means that the variety @xmath can be written as a real cone over a five
dimensional base @xmath i.e. @xmath . If the cone is a CY the base
@xmath is called a Sasaki-Einstein space. The low energy field theory is
a quiver gauge theory superconformal invariant. In this setup the
AdS/CFT correspondence makes an incredible prediction: this flat gauge
theory is “dual” to type @xmath string theory propagating in the
background @xmath with N units of five form flux turned on: @xmath . In
the @xmath , and @xmath case the horizon manifolds are respectively
@xmath and @xmath .

Recently, there has been renewed interest in generalizing the @xmath
correspondence to generic Sasaki-Einstein manifolds @xmath . This
interest has been initially motivated by the discovery of new infinite
classes of non compact @xmath metrics [ 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 ]
and the construction of their dual @xmath supersymmetric @xmath [ 15 ,
16 , 17 , 12 ] .

The @xmath geometry is obtained by taking the near horizon limit of the
stack of @xmath @xmath at the tip of the cone. We call this
correspondence a duality because it relates the strong coupling regime
of the gauge theory to the weak classical regime of the string and vice
versa. The duality of the correspondence is easily illustrated in the
example of @xmath gauge theory. In the field theory side there exist two
parameters: the gauge coupling @xmath and the number of colors @xmath .
In the string theory side the two parameters are the string coupling
@xmath and the string length @xmath parameterizing respectively the
quantum corrections to the classical string and the stringy corrections
to the supergravity. If we define the ’t Hooft coupling @xmath , the
matching between the parameters of the two sides of the correspondence
is the following:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.2.8)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

The large @xmath limit in the field theory side: @xmath with @xmath
fixed, correspond to the classical limit @xmath in the string theory
side. The strong coupling limit @xmath in the field theory correspond to
the @xmath limit of the string theory. Namely, according to the AdS/CFT
correspondence, the strong coupling limit of the gauge theory is mapped
to classical gravity. This kind of correspondence among the parameters
is going to repeat, in a more difficult setup, in all the gauge gravity
duality examples. We can rephrase the correspondence saying that in the
strong coupling limit the correct degrees of freedom of a superconformal
field theory are the classical strings of the type IIB string theory on
some specific vacuum. The correspondence predicts the match between the
spectrum of operators of the SCFT and the states of the string theory.
Namely to every gauge invariant operator in the field theory corresponds
a state in the string theory side. This fact will be very important for
us because we will be able to check properties of the BPS spectrum in
the weak coupling regime, using the field theory, and in the strong
coupling regime using the string theory.

Our main interest will be to study some supersymmetric properties of
these gauge theories, obtained as low energy limit of N D3 brane at
conical CY singularities, and their string dual realization: namely
their moduli space and their BPS spectrum.

### 1.3 Toric CY Singularities

The number of non compact conical CY singularities is infinite, and the
complete understanding of the relations between singularities and gauge
theories is far from being achieved. There exist a particular sub class
of singularities that is very well understood: namely the toric
singularities. Roughly speaking a six dimensional manifold is toric if
it has at least @xmath isometry. This is for sure the case of @xmath ,
and the conifold we have just analyzed. The family of six dimensional
toric CY conical singularities is infinite and contains as easy examples
all the abelian orbifolds of @xmath .

¿From the algebraic-geometric point of view the data of a conical toric
Calabi-Yau are encoded in a rational polyhedral cone @xmath in @xmath
defined by a set of vectors @xmath , @xmath . For a CY cone, using an
@xmath transformation, it is always possible to carry these vectors in
the form @xmath . In this way the toric diagram can be drawn in the
@xmath plane (see for example Figure 1.2 ).

In the flat @xmath case and in the conifold case @xmath the defining
vectors are respectively:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.3.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.3.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The CY equations can be reconstructed from this set of combinatorial
data using the dual cone @xmath . This is defined by:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.3.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath are the inward pointing vectors orthogonal to the facets of
the polyhedral cone @xmath . The two cones are related as follow. The
geometric generators for the cone @xmath , which are vectors aligned
along the edges of @xmath , are the perpendicular vectors to the facets
of @xmath .

To give an algebraic-geometric description of the CY, we need to
consider the cone @xmath as a semi-group and find its generators over
the integer numbers. The primitive vectors pointing along the edges
generate the cone over the real numbers but we generically need to add
other vectors to obtain a basis over the integers. We denote by @xmath
with @xmath a set of generators of @xmath over the integers.

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.3.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The vectors generating the dual cone in the flat @xmath case and in the
conifold case @xmath are respectively ( see Figure 1.2 ):

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.3.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.3.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The @xmath vectors @xmath generating the dual cone in @xmath are clearly
linearly dependent for @xmath , and they satisfy the additive relations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.3.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The three vectors in ( 1.3.13 ) are linearly independent, while the four
vectors in ( 1.3.14 ) satisfy the linear relation:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.3.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

To every vector @xmath it is possible to associate a coordinate @xmath
in some ambient space @xmath . The linear relations ( 1.3.15 ) translate
into a set of multiplicative relations among the coordinates @xmath .

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.3.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

These are the algebraic equations defining the six-dimensional CY cone.

In the @xmath case the three coordinates do not satisfy any constrains
and they describe a copy of @xmath , while in the conifold they
reproduce the conifold’s defining equation: @xmath .

The class of toric singularities is interesting for two main reasons: It
is large enough to make general predictions and it is easy enough to
make complete computations. Indeed the correspondence between quiver
gauge theories (considering equivalent two theories that flow to the
same IR fixed point) and singularities is well understood in the toric
case [ 9 , 10 , 13 , 11 ] . Namely give the geometric singularity it is
known how to obtain the gauge theory (modulo Seiberg dualities ) and
vice versa, from the gauge theory is is possible to reproduce the
geometric singularity.

### 1.4 Toric Quiver Gauge Theories

As we have already explained a gauge theory obtained as low energy
dynamics of N D3 branes at a singularity is of quiver type. It means
that the possible gauge groups and chiral matter is highly restricted
and can be easily described by a graph called the quiver diagram, see
Figure 1.1 . Roughly speaking these graphs give the structure of
fractional branes and open strings at the singularity. To complete the
description of the gauge theory we must add to the graph the
informations regarding the superpotential. This is an extra information
and it is not included in the quiver graph.

In the particular case of toric CY singularities the relation between
the geometry and the gauge theory is well under control [ 16 , 12 , 42 ,
9 , 10 , 43 , 18 , 44 , 35 , 19 , 13 , 11 ] . The non toric case is
still less understood: there exist studies on generalized conifolds [ 45
, 46 ] , del Pezzo series [ 47 , 48 , 49 ] , and more recently there was
a proposal to construct new non toric examples [ 50 ] .

In the toric case what make the things easier is that it is possible to
include the informations regarding the superpotential in an graph called
the periodic quiver or in its dual version called the brane tiling. See
[ 51 , 52 ] for good reviews. Indeed in the toric case the gauge theory
is completely identified by the periodic quiver , a diagram drawn on
@xmath (it is the “lift” of the usual quiver to the torus): nodes
represent @xmath gauge groups, oriented links represent chiral
bifundamental multiplets and faces represent the superpotential: the
trace of the product of chiral fields of a face gives a superpotential
term ( see Figure 1.3 ).

Equivalently the gauge theory is described by the dimer configuration ,
or brane tiling , the dual graph of the periodic quiver, drawn also on a
torus @xmath . In the dimer the role of faces and vertices is exchanged:
faces are gauge groups and vertices are superpotential terms. The dimer
is a bipartite graph: it has an equal number of white and black vertices
(superpotential terms with sign + or - respectively) and links connect
only vertices of different colors ( see Figure 1.3 ). The Lagrangian of
the quiver gauge theories describe the UV degrees of freedom. These
theories generically flow in the IR to superconformal field theories. It
is well known that different gauge theories in the UV can flow to the
same fixed point: a famous example are the electric and magnetic SQCD.
These theories are very different in the UV but in the IR they are
exactly the same, or better they are dual to each other: when one theory
is weakly coupled the other is strongly coupled and vice versa. The
field theory transformation that map one theory to its dual is called
Seiberg duality. In the @xmath SQCD with @xmath colors and @xmath
flavors @xmath without superpotential and @xmath the Seiberg duality
maps this theory to a dual SQCD with @xmath gauge group, @xmath dual
quarks @xmath , with reverse chirality with respect to the @xmath , and
a new elementary mesonic field @xmath , that in the original theory is
the composite field @xmath , and a superpotential @xmath . The two
theory are exactly equivalent in the IR and they are dual to each other.
It turns out that some generalization of this Seiberg dual map acts in
the quiver gauge theory as well. It is exactly the Seiberg dual map just
described for the SQCD applied to a single @xmath factor in the @xmath
gauge group of the quiver theory. Indeed by applying Seiberg dualities
to a quiver gauge theory we can obtain different quivers that flow in
the IR to the same CFT: to a toric diagram we can associate different
quivers/dimers describing the same IR physics. It turns out that in the
toric case one can always find phases where all the gauge groups have
the same number of colors: @xmath ; these are called toric phases .
Seiberg dualities keep constant the number of gauge groups @xmath , but
may change the number of fields @xmath , and therefore the number of
superpotential terms @xmath (since the dimer is on a torus we have:
@xmath .). Applying Seiberg dualities it is possible to obtain a toric
phase with the smallest possible number of chiral fields: these are
called minimal toric phases and all along this thesis we will mainly use
these phases to describe the quivers gauge theories.
The pattern of global symmetries of the gauge theories and their
relation to the geometric properties of the singularities will be very
important for us. In particular non anomalous @xmath symmetries play a
very important role in the gauge theory. For smooth horizons @xmath we
expect @xmath global non anomalous symmetries (we include the R symmetry
in the counting of the global symmetries), where @xmath is the number of
sides of the toric diagram in the dual theory. We can count these
symmetries from the number of massless vectors in the @xmath dual
gravity background. Indeed the AdS/CFT maps the global current operators
in the SCFT to the gauge fields in @xmath . Since the manifold H is
toric, the metric has three @xmath isometries and reducing the metric
over H gives three gauge vector fields in @xmath . One of these
(generated by the Reeb vector: the vector fields under which the killing
spinor of the @xmath supersymmetric geometry is not invariant )
corresponds to the R-symmetry while the other two give two global flavor
symmetries in the gauge theory. There are other @xmath global baryonic
symmetries in the gauge theory. As already explained these come from the
@xmath gauge factors that decouple in the IR. Of these @xmath global
symmetries just @xmath have geometric origin and are non anomalous in
the field theory. Indeed other gauge fields in @xmath come from the
reduction of the RR four form on the non-trivial three-cycles in the
horizon manifold @xmath , and there are @xmath three-cycles in homology
[ 12 ] when @xmath is smooth. On the field theory side, these gauge
fields correspond to baryonic symmetries. Summarizing, the global non
anomalous symmetries are:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.4.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

If the horizon @xmath is not smooth (that is the toric diagram has
integer points lying on the edges), equation ( 1.4.18 ) is still true
with @xmath equal to the perimeter of the toric diagram in the sense of
toric geometry (d = number of vertices of toric diagram + number of
integer points along edges).

The @xmath gauge theory has an @xmath global symmetry coming from the
isometry of the @xmath sphere in @xmath . The non anomalous abelian
symmetries are the @xmath abelian torus contained in @xmath . The three
homology of @xmath is trivial (no three cycle over which reduce the RR
four form), implying that the theory do not have baryonic symmetry.

In the conifold case the global symmetry of the gauge theory is easily
readable from the quotient structure of @xmath , indeed @xmath . The
field theory has a global symmetry group containing the factor @xmath
coming from the isometry of @xmath . The conifold theory has also a
baryonic symmetry coming from the non trivial topological three cycles
structure of @xmath . Indeed topologically @xmath and the RR four form
reduced on @xmath gives another vector field in @xmath corresponding to
the baryonic symmetry in the conformal field theory. The abelian
symmetries of the conifold correspond to the abelian @xmath torus
contained in the isometry group of the @xmath times the @xmath baryonic
symmetry.

This way of proceeding is generic: the reduction of the metric feels the
@xmath isometry of the toric variety, while the reduction of the four
form RR field feels the topological structure of @xmath that can be
shown to be topologically a connected sum of @xmath @xmath spaces,
namely: @xmath .

In the following we will use the fact that these @xmath global non
anomalous charges ( including the R charge) can be parametrized by
@xmath parameters @xmath [ 35 , 19 ] , each ones associated with a
vertex of the toric diagram. There exist a simple algorithm to compute
the charge of a generic link in the dimer in function of the parameters
@xmath in a way in which this parametrization automatically solve the
conditions of vanishing of gauge and superpotential beta functions [ 35
, 19 ] , and the @xmath independent free quantities @xmath parametrize
the @xmath global abelian non R symmetries of the gauge theory that can
mix with the R-symmetry. The value of @xmath at the fixed point can be
found by using a-maximization [ 53 ] .

### 1.5 The Mesonic Chiral Ring

There are two main lessons we can learn from what we said till now:

-   the gauge theories on D3 branes at singularities have two
    geometrically different abelian symmetries: the global ones plus the
    R symmetry, that we can summarize as mesonic symmetries, and the
    baryonic symmetries;

-   a sub set of the moduli space of one D3 brane at the singularity
    @xmath must reproduce the geometric singularity itself, and the
    moduli space of a gauge theory can be expressed as set equations
    among gauge invariant operators.

Putting together these informations and the example of @xmath and of the
conifold already discussed, we can guess that the geometric singularity
@xmath is reproduced in the field theory language as the constrains
among the gauge invariant mesonics operators for @xmath D3 brane, and
the N times symmetric product of the singularity Sym @xmath is the
mesonic moduli space for generic N number of D3 branes.

We know that the gauge theory has other symmetries than the mesonic
ones, and other gauge invariant operators charged under these
symmetries. For example in the case of the conifold the operators @xmath
, @xmath do not take vev over the N times symmetric product of the
conifold. For these reasons we can guess that the mesonic moduli space
can be obtained as some kind of quotient of the complete moduli space:
it is the subset of the complete moduli space where all the operators
charged under the baryonic symmetries get zero vacuum expectation
values. We will explore the complete moduli space and the structure of
the baryonic chiral ring all along this thesis. For the moment it is
worthwhile to make some comments regarding the mesonic moduli space and
its chiral ring. We will find again this structure as a very particular
case of the general discussion about the complete moduli space of the
gauge theory and the complete chiral ring.

There exist a very straightforward correspondence between the chiral
ring of mesonic operators in the SCFT and the semigroup of integer
points in @xmath , the dual cone of the fan @xmath [ 54 , 44 , 55 ] .
The idea of the correspondence is simple: part of the moduli space of a
superconformal quiver gauge theory in the abelian case @xmath , with a
single regular brane, is the toric CY cone @xmath where the D3-brane can
move in the string theory set up. This toric cone is described by a
convex rational polyhedral cone in @xmath , the fan @xmath . Mesonic
operators are closed oriented loops in field theory and can be
considered as well defined functions on the toric cone: the value of the
function in every point of the moduli space is the vev of the mesonic
operator in that vacuum and such functions are the same for F-term
equivalent operators. In toric geometry the ring of algebraic functions
on the toric cone is in one to one correspondence with the semigroup of
integer points in the dual cone @xmath . We may then expect a one to one
correspondence between the chiral ring of mesonic operators, equivalent
up to F-terms, and the integer points in @xmath . This is indeed the
case, as it will come out from the general discussion in the following
chapters. We will see that the three integer numbers that are associated
to the points in @xmath are (related to) the charges of the mesons under
the three mesonic field theory @xmath (flavors and R symmetry ), coming
from isometries of the geometry. As a consequence of this guessed
correspondence to every mesons in the chiral ring modulo F-term
equations it is associated an integer points in the dual cone @xmath .
These integer points are nothing else that the holomorphic functions
over the algebraic variety @xmath . They satisfy the constrains induced
by the algebraic relations defining the variety. Hence all the relations
between points in the dual cone become relations among mesons in the
field theory. In fact, using toric geometry and dimer technology, it is
possible to show that there exists a one to one correspondence between
the integer points inside @xmath and the mesonic operators in the dual
field theory, modulo F-term constraints [ 22 , 44 ] . To every integer
point @xmath in @xmath we indeed associate a meson @xmath in the gauge
theory with @xmath charge @xmath . In particular, the mesons are
uniquely determined by their charge under @xmath . The first two
coordinates @xmath of the vector @xmath are the charges of the meson
under the two flavor @xmath symmetries. Since the cone @xmath is
generated as a semi-group by the vectors @xmath the generic meson will
be obtained as a product of basic mesons @xmath , and we can restrict to
these generators for all our purposes. The multiplicative relations
satisfied by the coordinates @xmath become a set of multiplicative
relations among the mesonic operators @xmath inside the chiral ring of
the gauge theory. It is possible to prove that these relations are a
consequence of the F-term constraints of the gauge theory. The abelian
version of this set of relations is just the set of algebraic equations
defining the CY variety as embedded in @xmath .

The examples of @xmath gauge theory and the conifold are shown in Figure
1.2 and were already discussed at the beginning of this Section. In the
case of @xmath , the three basic mesons @xmath , @xmath , @xmath
correspond to independent charge vectors in @xmath and to the three
independent coordinates @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , in @xmath . In the
conifold case, the four mesons @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath
correspond to the four vectors with one linear relation generating the
dual cone @xmath for the conifold, and to the four embedding coordinates
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath of the conifold in @xmath . The four
basic mesonic operators satisfy the relations induced by vector
generating @xmath and we obtain the description of the conifold as a
quadric @xmath in @xmath from the constrains on the mesonic chiral ring.

Mesons correspond to closed loops in the quiver and, as shown in [ 54 ,
55 ] , for any meson there is an F-term equivalent meson that passes for
a given gauge group. We can therefore assume that all meson loops have a
base point at a specific gauge group and consider them as @xmath
matrices @xmath . The F-term equations imply that all mesons commute and
can be simultaneously diagonalized. The additional F-term constraints
require that the mesons, and therefore all their eigenvalues, satisfy
the algebraic equations defining the Calabi-Yau. This gives a moduli
space which is the @xmath -fold symmetrized product of the Calabi-Yau.
This has been explicitly verified in [ 56 ] for the case of the quiver
theories [ 15 , 16 , 17 , 12 ] corresponding to the @xmath manifolds.

#### 1.5.1 The Coordinate Ring

Behind the previous discussion there is a more algebraic approach to the
equations describing the geometric singularity. The modern geometry has
the tendency to describe the geometric objects using the set of
functions well defined over them. For example continuous functions for
topological spaces, differentiable functions for differential geometry,
holomorphic functions for complex manifolds. In the case of algebraic
geometry ( namely the branch of the geometry studying the zero locus of
polynomial equations ) the well defined functions are the algebraic
functions: complex polynomials. Indeed there exist a one to one
correspondence between the ring of the algebraic functions over an
algebraic variety and the algebraic variety itself. For this reason many
of the geometrical problems can be translated into a purely algebraic
language. If we are able to get all the informations about the ring of
functions of a given variety ( the coordinate ring ) we are able to
obtain all the properties of the variety itself. Indeed the algebraic
descriptions of a variety defined as zero locus of polynomials goes in
the following way: take an ambient space @xmath over which the
polynomials defining the variety take values, giving an embedding of the
variety in @xmath . Over @xmath there exist a well define ring @xmath
given by all the possible complex combinations of monomials in the
@xmath complex coordinates of @xmath . The zero locus defining the
variety is given as a set of equations over this ring of function:
@xmath , where @xmath are polynomials in @xmath , and the expression
@xmath means the zero locus of the polynomials into the parenthesis.
There exists a one to one correspondence between the variety @xmath and
the ideal of functions @xmath vanishing on @xmath . The ring of
functions vanishing over the variety @xmath is finite generated by the
set of polynomials defining the the variety as a zero set in @xmath :
@xmath . The set of functions well defined over @xmath is given by the
restrictions to the variety @xmath of the ring of all the polynomial
functions @xmath over @xmath . This is the coordinate ring of the
variety @xmath and it is given by:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.5.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Now to make short a long story, once we have defined the ring of
functions, the algebraic geometry tells us that the “correct” way to
define algebraically a variety is to define it as the set of particular
ideals, called the prime ideals, of the coordinate ring @xmath . This
set is called the Spec of a ring, and the algebraic definition of an
affine variety @xmath is:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.5.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Intuitively we can translate the equation ( 1.5.20 ) as: the variety
@xmath is the minimal set of points over which the ring of functions
@xmath is well defined.

In the field theory language we are interested in the moduli space of
the theory, that is by definition an algebraic variety @xmath , and in
the chiral ring of the theory ( all the @xmath BPS operators), that are
the set of functions @xmath well defined over the moduli space.

In the case of @xmath and of the conifold, the equation ( 1.5.20 )
become:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.5.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

For the toric case all the properties of the ring of functions over
@xmath can be obtained from the lattice defining the toric diagram;
namely a basis of holomorphic functions over @xmath is given by the
integer points of the dual cone @xmath . In algebraic geometry this fact
translate into the equation:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.5.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

meaning that the toric variety @xmath is the minimal set of points over
which the ring of functions corresponding to the integer points in
@xmath is well defined.

#### 1.5.2 The Hilbert Series and the PE Function

We claimed that the mesonic moduli space of the gauge theory for a
single D3 brane is exactly the transverse space @xmath . A Natural
question is: what is the spectrum of all the mesonic @xmath BPS
operators ? In the @xmath case the answer is pretty simple: it is the
spectrum of all the holomorphic functions over @xmath .

To collect this information in a useful way we would like to have a
function @xmath such that, once expanded in series for small values of
@xmath , gives the number of holomorphic functions @xmath over @xmath
with the set of @xmath charges @xmath , @xmath , @xmath under the
symmetry of @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.5.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

These functions are pretty famous in mathematical literature and they
are called Hilbert functions. Hilbert functions are rational functions
with integer coefficients, and we will learn to appreciate their
properties along this thesis.

We can give examples of these functions for the flat space @xmath and
the conifold. The set of @xmath BPS mesonic operators can be expressed
as the set of all single and multi trace operators subject to symmetry
relations and F-terms equations. It is possible to show that the Hilbert
function for the set of @xmath BPS mesonic operators, single and multi
trace, in the case @xmath is the same of the Hilbert fiction for the
@xmath BPS mesonic single trace operators in the limit @xmath [ 23 ] .
Hence counting the single trace operators for @xmath and the multi trace
operators for @xmath gives exactly the same result.

In the case @xmath the three chiral fields of the @xmath gauge theory
parametrize a copy of @xmath . We can assign them the three @xmath
charges according their directions along the complex space. We now
introduce three chemical potentials: @xmath , @xmath , @xmath counting
the three @xmath charges of the mesonic gauge invariant operators i.e
counting the number of @xmath , @xmath , @xmath fields contained in the
composite operators. The generic function of @xmath is @xmath
representing the @xmath BPS operator @xmath . Hence the function
counting the number of @xmath BPS operators is:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.5.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

For simplicity we want to count @xmath BPS operators according to their
dimensions. We impose @xmath and we expand the resulting function for
small values of @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.5.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Let us read this expansion: there are 1 field of zero dimension: the
identity operator @xmath ; 3 fields of dimension 1: @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath ; 6 fields of dimension 2: @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath ; 10 fields of dimension 3: @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ; and so
on…

For the conifold theory the situation is a bit more complicated because
the ring of holomorphic functions is not freely generated ( 1.5.21 ).
But there is another intuitive way for counting chiral operators: the
gauge theory dual to the conifold singularity contains the global
symmetry @xmath , and all the chiral mesonic operators are in
representation of this symmetry. The elementary fields @xmath and @xmath
transform respectively under the (2,1) and (1,2) representation. Because
we consider the abelian case @xmath the elementary fields @xmath and
@xmath are c-numbers and commute among themselves. Hence the chiral
operators will be in the symmetric representations of @xmath . These
representations have dimension @xmath . Because we are considering only
mesonic operators we want the numbers of @xmath fields to be equal to
the number of @xmath fields: the chiral mesonic operators transform
under the symmetric representations of @xmath of dimension @xmath .
Defining the chemical potential @xmath counting the number of elementary
mesonic fields @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath in the chiral mesonic
ring we obtain:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.5.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As we will see there exist a systematic way to construct such functions.
The Hilbert series contains a lot of informations regarding the
structure of the chiral ring at weak and strong coupling, the geometric
properties of the singularity, informations regarding important matches
between observables in the gravity and the gauge theory setup in the
context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and many other informations that
we will learn to appreciate in the following.

As we have just seen in explicit examples the Hilbert series has the
form of a rational function:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.5.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the dimension of the embedding space, while @xmath is a
polynomial of integer coefficients. According to the form of @xmath the
moduli space of the gauge theory ( in this context the mesonic moduli
space ) divide in three different classes:

-   1. if @xmath the moduli space is freely generated: the generators
    don’t have any relations among themselves, for example @xmath (
    1.5.25 );

-   2. if @xmath is a finite product of monomials of the form @xmath :
    @xmath , the moduli space is a complete intersection: the generators
    satisfy a set of algebraic relations such that the number of
    relations plus the dimension of the moduli space is equal to the
    number of generators; for example the conifold ( 1.5.26 );

-   3.If @xmath cannot be written as a finite product of monomials of
    the form @xmath , the moduli space is not a complete intersection,
    namely the number of relations among the generators is bigger than
    the codimension of the moduli space inside the embedding space
    @xmath .

The last class of models is by far the largest class. Most moduli spaces
of vacua do not admit a simple algebraic description which truncates at
some level. It is important, however, to single out and specify the
moduli spaces which fall into the first two classes as they are
substantially simpler to describe and to analyze. Along this thesis we
will meet a lot of moduli spaces that are not complete intersections.

In the context of the counting procedure there exist a very important
mathematical function called the Plethystic Exponential: @xmath . We
will see how naturally it appears in the context of counting BPS
operators and what is its physical meaning. Its definition is the
following: take a function @xmath that vanishes at the origin, @xmath
its Plethystic Exponential is given by ¹ ¹ 1 Note that in order to avoid
an infinity the PE is defined with respect to a function that vanishes
when all chemical potentials are set to zero. :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.5.28)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The plethystic exponential has the role of taking a generating function
for a set of operators and of counting all possible symmetric functions
of them. It has two main roles in the counting procedure. First of all
it allows to pass from the counting for one brane to the counting for
generic number of branes N. Indeed in the case of the mesonic chiral
ring the reason is easy to explain: the mesonic moduli space for N brane
is the N times symmetric product of the mesonic moduli space for a
single brane. Hence the chiral spectrum will be the symmetric product of
the chiral spectrum for just one brane. Given the generating function
for the mesonic chiral ring for one brane @xmath , let us define the
chemical potential @xmath counting the number of D3 branes; we obtain
the generating function @xmath for generic @xmath applying the @xmath
-inserted ² ² 2 Note that the @xmath insertion satisfies the condition
that the argument of PE vanishes when all chemical potentials are set to
zero. plethystic exponential @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.5.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The second role is given by its inverse function called the plethystic
logarithm (PL @xmath PE @xmath ). It is defined as:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.5.30)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the Möbius function

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.5.31)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The important fact about this operator is that acting with PE @xmath on
a generating function we obtain the generating series for the generators
and the relations in the chiral ring. The result is generically ³ ³ 3 In
the @xmath correspondence the moduli space of the gauge theory is
typically not a complete intersection variety. an infinite series in
which the first terms with the plus sign give the basic generators while
the first terms with the minus sign give the relations between these
basic generators. Then there is an infinite series of terms with plus
and minus signs due to the fact that the moduli space of vacua is not a
complete intersection and the relations in the chiral ring is not
trivially generated by the relations between the basic invariants, but
receives stepwise corrections at higher degrees. For the particular case
of complete intersections the series has a finite extension, with the
first terms with the plus sign corresponding to the generators of the
chiral ring, while the other terms with the minus sign corresponding to
the relations among the generators. Indeed the form of this function
greatly simplify in the case of the freely generated moduli space and in
the case of complete intersection moduli spaces.

Let us apply this function to the two easy cases we have already
studied. @xmath is freely generated:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.5.32)
  -- -------- -- ----------

meaning that coordinate ring of @xmath is generated by 3 generators:
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath without relations.

For the conifold we have:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.5.33)
  -- -------- -- ----------

meaning that the coordinate ring of the conifold is generated by 4
generators of degree one: @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , that
satisfy a quadratic relation: @xmath .

As we have just seen in the case of freely generated or complete
intersection moduli space the expansion of @xmath has a finite
extension, in all the other case the expansion of the @xmath will be
infinite with plus and minus sign. In the following we will see some
examples of this phenomenon.

### 1.6 Summary and Discussions

In this chapter we introduced the subject of D3 branes at singularity
@xmath . Using the easy examples of @xmath and the conifold we
illustrated various properties of the IR gauge theory living on the D
branes. We explained the general structure of toric geometry, quiver
gauge theories, their moduli space and their chiral ring, and we put
this brane setup in relation with the AdS/CFT correspondence. In
particular we focalized on the mesonic branch of the gauge theory and on
the structure of the mesonic chiral ring. We tried to proceed in an
intuitive way without paying too much attention to the mathematical
rigor. In the rest of the thesis we will do a more formal and careful
analysis of the holomorphic properties of D3 branes at singularities. In
particular we will study the complete moduli space and the complete
chiral ring, and the result of this chapter will be seen as a special
case of this general and more rigorous analysis.

In the last part of this chapter we introduced the plethystic function
PE trying to explain its importance in the counting procedure. Indeed
the PE function acting on a Hilbert series for one brane is the
generating function for the Hilbert series for the generic N cases,
counting all the N times symmetric products of the function counted by
@xmath generating function. The inverse function of the plethystic
exponential PL is the generating function for the generators and the
relations of the chiral ring. We have seen these properties in the
context of the mesonic moduli space and the mesonic chiral ring, using
the intuitive picture that the mesonic moduli space for N D3 branes is
the N times symmetric product of @xmath . We will be finally interested
in writing partition functions for the complete spectra of BPS
operators, including all the operators charged under the baryonic
symmetries. We will learn that even in this much more complicated case
there will be a symmetric structure inside the chiral counting and the
PE function will be very useful for passing from the case of @xmath
brane to the generic number @xmath of branes. Applying the PL function
to the complete partition function will tell us important informations
regarding the spectrum of generators of the chiral ring and its
relations.

We will solve the problem of counting the complete spectrum of BPS
operators in the following chapters. This study will take us busy for
long. Before entering in this very interesting problem we will analyze
the complete moduli space @xmath of SCFT at singularity @xmath . This
space is composed by a mesonic branch, that we have just analyzed, and a
baryonic branch, that we will analyze in the following chapter. The two
branches are strictly merged and we would like to have a complete
characterization of the total moduli space. Indeed, as we will show in
the next chapter, it is possible to almost completely characterize the
moduli space of @xmath brane. The moduli space for generic @xmath is a
much harder beast. But thanks to the ability we will develop for
counting chiral BPS operators, we will be able to extract very
interesting informations about the moduli space for generic @xmath . Let
us start this long strip with a general analysis of the moduli spaces
@xmath of SCFT at singularities @xmath .

## Chapter 2 The Master Space of @xmath Gauge Theories

The vacuum moduli space @xmath , of supersymmetric gauge theories is one
of the most fundamental quantities in modern physics. In this chapter we
want to study the full moduli space @xmath of the class of @xmath
supersymmetric gauge theories obtained as the low energy limit of N D3
branes at toric conical CY singularity @xmath . @xmath is a combination
of the mesonic and baryonic branches, the former being the symmetric
product of @xmath , as already discussed in the previous chapter.

In consonance with the mathematical literature, the single brane moduli
space is called the master space @xmath . Illustrating with a host of
explicit examples, we exhibit many algebro-geometric properties of the
master space such as when @xmath is toric Calabi-Yau, behavior of its
Hilbert series, its irreducible components and its symmetries.

Once we understand the full moduli space of a class of gauge theories
the next step is to study its spectra of @xmath BPS operators. This
study will bring us in a long trip in the algebraic geometric properties
of the singularity @xmath and in the AdS/CFT correspondence. We will
study the chiral ring of these theories in the following chapters. This
study will give us a lot of informations regarding the SCFT and, in the
context of the moduli space @xmath , will allow us to extract very
interesting informations regarding the symmetries of the moduli space
for the generic non abelian case with N D3 branes. We will investigate
this point in chapter 6 .

### 2.1 Generalities

The moduli space @xmath is given by the vanishing of the scalar
potential as a function of the scalar components of the superfields of
the field theory. This, in turn, is the set of zeros, dubbed flatness,
of so-called D-terms and F-terms , constituting a parameter, or moduli,
space of solutions describing the vacuum. The structure of this space is
usually complicated, and should be best cast in the language of
algebraic varieties. Typically, @xmath consists of a union of various
branches, such as the mesonic branch or the baryonic branch, the Coulomb
branch or the Higgs branch; the names are chosen according to some
characteristic property of the specific branch.

It is a standard fact now that @xmath can be phrased in a succinct
mathematical language: it is the symplectic quotient of the space of
F-flatness, by the gauge symmetries provided by the D-flatness. We will
denote the space of F-flatness by @xmath and symmetries prescribed by
D-flatness as @xmath , then we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Using this language, we see that @xmath is a parent space whose quotient
is a moduli space. In the mathematical literature, this parent is
referred to as the master space [ 57 ] and to this cognomen we shall
adhere.

In the context of certain string theory backgrounds, @xmath has an
elegant geometrical realization. When D-branes are transverse to an
affine (non-compact) Calabi-Yau space @xmath , a supersymmetric gauge
theory exists on the world-volume of the branes. Of particular interest
is, of course, when the gauge theory, prescribed by D3-branes, is in
four-dimensions. Our main interest is the IR physics of this system,
where all Abelian symmetry decouples and the gauge symmetry is fully
non-Abelian, typically given by products of @xmath groups. The Abelian
factors are not gauged but rather appear as global baryonic symmetries
of the gauge theory.

Under these circumstances, the moduli space @xmath is a combined mesonic
branch and baryonic branch. These branches are not necessarily separate
(irreducible) components of @xmath but are instead in most cases
intrinsically merged into one or more components in @xmath . Even when
mesonic and baryonic directions are mixed, it still makes sense to talk
about the more familiar mesonic moduli space @xmath , as the sub-variety
of @xmath parameterized by mesonic operators only. Since mesonic
operators have zero baryonic charge, and thus invariant under the @xmath
Abelian factors, the mesonic moduli space can be obtained as a further
quotient of @xmath by the Abelian symmetries:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This is the subset of the full moduli space already discussed in the
previous chapter in the case of @xmath and of the conifold.

We are interested in the theory of physical @xmath branes probing the
singularity; the gauge theory on the world-volume is then
superconformal.

It is of particular interest to consider the case of a single D3-brane
transverse to the Calabi-Yau three-fold @xmath , which will enlighten
the geometrical interpretation of the moduli space. Since the motion of
the D-brane is parameterized by this transverse space, part of the
vacuum moduli space @xmath is, per constructionem , precisely the space
which the brane probes. The question of which part of the moduli space
is going to be clarified in detail in this chapter. For now it is enough
to specify that for a single D-brane it is the mesonic branch:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In this chapter we are interested in studying the full moduli space
@xmath . In general, @xmath will be an algebraic variety of dimension
greater than three. In the case of a single D3-brane, @xmath , the IR
theory has no gauge group and the full moduli space @xmath is given by
the space of F-flatness @xmath . Geometrically, @xmath is a @xmath
fibration over the mesonic moduli space @xmath given by relaxing the
@xmath D-term constraints in ( 2.1.2 ). Physically, @xmath is obtained
by adding baryonic directions to the mesonic moduli space. Of course, we
can not talk about baryons for @xmath but we can alternatively interpret
these directions as Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) parameters in the stringy
realization of the @xmath gauge theory. Indeed on the world-volume of a
single D-brane there is a collection of @xmath gauge groups, each giving
rise to a FI parameter, which relax the D-term constraint in ( 2.1.2 ).
When these FI parameters acquire vacuum expectation values they induce
non-zero values for the collection of fields in the problem and this is
going to be taken to be the full moduli space @xmath . If one further
restricts the moduli space to zero baryonic number we get the mesonic
branch which is @xmath , the Calabi-Yau itself.

For @xmath number of physical branes, the situation is more subtle. The
mesonic moduli space, probed by a collection of @xmath physical branes,
is given by the symmetrized product of @xmath copies of @xmath ¹ ¹ 1 Cf.
[ 58 ] for a consistency analysis of this identification. . The full
moduli space @xmath is a bigger algebraic variety of more difficult
characterization. One of the purposes of this chapter is to elucidate
this situation and to show how the properties of @xmath for arbitrary
number of branes are encoded in the master space @xmath for a single
brane. In view of the importance of the master space @xmath for one
brane even for larger @xmath , we will adopt the important convention
that, in the rest of the chapter, the word master space and the symbol
@xmath will refer to the @xmath case, unless explicitly stated.

The case of @xmath being a toric Calabi-Yau space has been studied
extensively over the last decade. The translation between the physics
data of the D-brane world volume gauge theory and the mathematical data
of the geometry of the toric @xmath was initiated in [ 59 , 60 , 61 ] .
In the computational language of [ 61 , 62 ] , the process of arriving
at the toric diagram from the quiver diagram plus superpotential was
called the forward algorithm, whereas the geometrical computation of the
gauge theory data given the toric diagram was called the inverse
algorithm. The computational intensity of these algorithms,
bottle-necked by finding dual integer cones, has been a technical
hurdle. Only lately it is realized that the correct way to think about
toric geometry in the context of gauge theories is through the language
of dimer models and brane tilings [ 9 , 10 , 13 , 11 ] that we have
already introduced in the previous chapter. Though the efficiency of
this new perspective has far superseded the traditional approach of the
partial resolutions of the inverse algorithm, the canonical toric
language of the latter is still conducive to us, particularly in
studying objects beyond @xmath , and in particular, @xmath . We will
thus make extensive use of this language as well as the modern one of
dimers.

Recently, a so-called plethystic programme [ 23 , 63 , 24 , 27 , 28 , 29
] has been advocated in counting the gauge invariant operators of
supersymmetric gauge theories, especially in the above-mentioned D-brane
quiver theories. For mesonic BPS operators, the fundamental generating
function turns out to be the Hilbert series of @xmath [ 23 , 63 ] , as
already illustrated in the previous chapter in the case of @xmath and of
the conifold. The beautiful fact is that the full counting [ 27 ] ,
including baryons as well, is achieved with the Hilbert series of @xmath
for one brane! Indeed, mesons have gauge-index contractions
corresponding to closed paths in the quiver diagram and the quotienting
by @xmath achieves this. Baryons, on the other hand, have more general
index-contractions and correspond to all paths in the quiver; whence
their counting should not involve the quotienting and the master space
should determine their counting. We will come back on this points in the
following chapters.

In light of the discussions thus far presented, it is clear that the
master space @xmath of gauge theories, especially those arising from
toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, is of unquestionable importance. It is
therefore the purpose of this chapter to investigate their properties in
detail. We exhibit many algebro-geometric properties of the master space
@xmath for one brane, including its decomposition into irreducible
components, its symmetry and the remarkable property of the biggest
component of being always toric Calabi-Yau if @xmath is.

We point out that even though we mainly concentrate on the master space
@xmath for one brane, we are able, using the operator counting
technique, to extract important information about the complete moduli
space @xmath , informations such as its symmetries for arbitrary number
of branes, as will be shown in chapter 6 .

The organization of the chapter is as follows. In 2.2 we introduce the
concept of the master space @xmath starting with various computational
approaches for some orbifold singularities @xmath , emphasizing on the
Hilbert series. In section 2.3 we put the accent on the toric
presentation of @xmath , and we will explain how to refine the Hilbert
series. We will then explain other two very useful and more physical
descriptions of @xmath : the symplectic quotient, known in the physics
literature as the linear sigma model, and the dimers/perfect matchings
realization, that represent the singularities as a system of fractional
branes. In section 2.4 we give some non orbifold examples, namely: the
conifold, the Suspended Pinched Point SPP, and the complex cone over the
@xmath surface. In particular we give a very preliminary discussion on
the effect of Seiberg duality on @xmath . In section 2.5 we give a
possible interpretation of the linear branches of @xmath as
parameterizing the IR flows of the gauge theories. In section 2.6 we
give a proof of the CY condition for the biggest irreducible component
of @xmath and we illustrate some general mathematical properties. We
conclude in section 2.7 giving a summary of the properties of @xmath and
an illustrative table for some selected examples.

### 2.2 The Master Space: the Basis and Orbifold Singularities

It was realized in [ 60 ] that for a single D3-brane probing a toric
Calabi-Yau threefold @xmath , the space of solutions to the F-terms is
also a toric variety, albeit of higher dimension. In particular, for a
quiver theory with @xmath nodes, it is of dimension @xmath . Thus we
have the first important property for the master space @xmath for a
toric @xmath quiver theory:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This can be seen as follows. The F-term equations are invariant under a
@xmath action, given by the three mesonic symmetries of the toric
quiver, one R and two flavor symmetries, as well as the @xmath baryonic
symmetries, including the anomalous ones. This induces an action of
@xmath on the master space. Moreover, the dimension of @xmath is exactly
@xmath as the following field theory argument shows. We know that the
mesonic moduli space has dimension three, being isomorphic to the
transverse Calabi-Yau manifold @xmath . As described in the
introduction, the mesonic moduli space is obtained as the solution of
both F-term and D-term constraints for the @xmath quiver theory. The
full master space is obtained by relaxing the @xmath D-term constraints.
Since an overall @xmath factor is decoupled, we have @xmath independent
baryonic parameters corresponding to the values of the @xmath D-terms,
which, by abuse of language, we can refer to as FI terms. As a result,
the dimension of the master space is @xmath , given by three mesonic
parameters plus @xmath FI terms.

A second property of the Master Space is its reducibility. We will see
in several examples below that it decomposes into several irreducible
components, the largest of which turns out to be of the same dimension
as the master space, and more importantly the largest component is a
toric Calabi-Yau manifold in @xmath complex dimensions which is
furthermore a cone over a Sasaki Einstein manifold of real dimension
@xmath . Examples follow below, as well as a proof that it is Calabi-Yau
in section 2.6 .

Having learned the dimension of the master space, let us now see a few
warm-up examples of what the space looks like. Let us begin with an
illustrative example of perhaps the most common affine toric variety,
viz., the Abelian orbifolds.

#### 2.2.1 Warm-up: an Etude in @xmath

The orbifold @xmath is well-studied. It is an affine toric singularity
whose toric diagrams are lattice points enclosed in a right-triangle of
lengths @xmath (cf. e.g., [ 64 ] ). The matter content and
superpotential for these theories can be readily obtained from brane-box
constructions [ 65 , 66 ] . We summarize as follows:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We point out here the important fact that in the notation above, when
either of the factors @xmath is equal to 1, the resulting theory is
really an @xmath gauge theory since the action of @xmath on the @xmath
is chosen so that it degenerates to have a line of singularities when
either @xmath or @xmath equals 1. In other words, if @xmath in ( 2.2.2
), we would have a @xmath orbifold rather than a proper @xmath one We
shall henceforth be careful to distinguish these two types of orbifolds
with this notation.

##### Direct Computation

Given the matter content and superpotential of an @xmath gauge theory, a
convenient and algorithmic method of computation, emphasizing ( 2.1.1 ),
is that of [ 67 ] . We can immediately compute @xmath as an affine
algebraic variety: it is an ideal in @xmath given by the @xmath
equations prescribed by @xmath . The defining equation is also readily
obtained: it is simply the image of the ring map @xmath from @xmath ,
i.e., the syzygies of the @xmath polynomials given by @xmath . To
specify @xmath explicitly as an affine algebraic variety, let us use the
notation that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Subsequently, we present what @xmath actually is as an algebraic variety
for some low values of @xmath in Table 2.1 . We remind the reader that,
of course, quotienting these above spaces by @xmath , which in the
algorithm of [ 67 ] is also achieved by a ring map, should all give our
starting point of @xmath .

As pointed out above, the limit of either @xmath or @xmath going to 1 in
the theory prescribed in ( 2.2.2 ) is really just @xmath with the @xmath
-fields, say, acting as adjoints. The first row and column of Table (
2.1 ) should thus be interpreted carefully since they are secretly
@xmath theories with adjoints. We shall study proper @xmath theories
later.

##### Hilbert Series

One of the most important quantities which characterize an algebraic
variety is the Hilbert series ² ² 2 Note, however, that the Hilbert
series is not a topological invariant and does depend on embedding. . In
[ 23 , 63 ] , it was pointed out that it is also key to the problem of
counting gauge invariant operators in the quiver gauge theory. We have
already seen its form and its application in the simple case of @xmath
and the conifold in ( 1.5.24 , 1.5.25 ) and ( 1.5.26 ) respectively. Let
us thus calculate this quantity for @xmath .

We recall that for a variety @xmath in @xmath , the Hilbert series is
the generating function for the dimension of the graded pieces:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath , the @xmath -th graded piece of @xmath can be thought of
as the number of independent degree @xmath (Laurent) polynomials on the
variety @xmath . The most useful property of @xmath is that it is a
rational function in @xmath and can be written in 2 ways:

  -- -- -- ---------
           (2.2.5)
  -- -- -- ---------

Importantly, both @xmath and @xmath are polynomials with integer
coefficients. The powers of the denominators are such that the leading
pole captures the dimension of the manifold and the embedding space,
respectively. In particular, @xmath always equals the degree of the
variety. For example in the equation ( 1.5.26 ) the first Hilbert series
is of the First Kind: the conifold is embedded in @xmath ; while the
second Hilbert series is of the Second Kind: the conifold has complex
dimension three.

We can also relate the Hilbert series to the Reeb vector, as is nicely
explained in [ 22 ] , and we will utilize this relation in the next
chapter.

For now, let us present in Table 2.2 the Hilbert series, in Second form,
of some of the examples above in Table 2.1 .

We see that indeed the leading pole is the dimension of @xmath and that
the numerator evaluated at 1 (i.e., the coefficient of the leading pole)
is equal to the degree of @xmath . Furthermore, we point out that the
Hilbert series thus far defined depends on a single variable @xmath , we
shall shortly discuss in § 2.3.1 how to refine this to multi-variate and
how these variables should be thought of as chemical potentials.

##### Irreducible Components and Primary Decomposition

The variety @xmath may not be a single irreducible piece, but rather, be
composed of various components. This is a well recognized feature in
supersymmetric gauge theories. The different components are typically
called branches of the moduli space, such as Coulomb or Higgs branches,
mesonic or baryonic branches.

It is thus an interesting question to identify the different components
since sometimes the massless spectrum on each component has its own
unique features. We are naturally lead to a process to extract the
various components which in the math literature is called primary
decomposition of the ideal corresponding to @xmath . This is an
extensively studied algorithm in computational algebraic geometry
(cf. e.g. [ 68 ] ) and a convenient program which calls these routines
externally but based on the more familiar Mathematica interface is [ 69
] .

###### Example of @xmath:

Let us first exemplify with the case of @xmath (i.e., @xmath ). This
case, having @xmath supersymmetry, is known to have a Coulomb branch and
a Higgs branch which is a combined mesonic and baryonic branch. The
superpotential is

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

composed of a total of 9 fields, where the @xmath fields are adjoint
fields in the @xmath vector multiplet of the corresponding gauge group.
Here, since we are dealing with a single D-brane, these fields have
charge 0. Hence, @xmath is defined, as an ideal in @xmath , by 9
quadrics:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Immediately one can see that on one branch, the so-called Higgs branch,
which we shall denote as @xmath , the adjoint fields @xmath do not
participate. Thus it is defined by the first 3 equations in ( 2.2.7 ): 3
quadrics in 6 variables. Furthermore, one can see that one of the
quadrics is not independent. Therefore @xmath is a complete intersection
of 2 quadratics in @xmath , of dimension 4. To this we must form a
direct product with the Coulomb branch which is parametrized by the
@xmath -directions, which turns out to be one dimensional @xmath (in
order to satisfy the remaining 6 equations from ( 2.2.7 ) such that the
@xmath ’s and @xmath ’s are non-zero). Hence, @xmath is 5-dimensional
(as we expect from ( 2.2.1 ) since there are @xmath nodes), of degree 4,
and composed of 2 quadrics in @xmath crossed with @xmath .

Now, this example may essentially be observed with ease, more involved
examples requires an algorithmic approach, as we shall see in many cases
which ensue. The decoupling of the @xmath ’s is indicative of the fact
that this is indeed just an orbifold of @xmath .

###### Example of @xmath:

Let us next study a proper orbifold @xmath with a non-trivial action,
say @xmath , on the @xmath . This is also referred to in the literature
as @xmath , the cone over the zeroth del Pezzo surface. In other words,
this is the total space of the line bundle @xmath over @xmath , once the
@xmath is blown down. Here, there are 9 fields and the theory is
summarized in Figure 2.1 .

Now, the F-terms are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and a direct primary decomposition shows that @xmath is itself
irreducible and it is given, using the notation in ( 2.2.3 ), as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

a non-complete-intersection of 9 quadrics as given in ( 2.2.8 ),
embedded in @xmath . We see that the dimension is 5 since there are 3
nodes. The Hilbert series (cf. [ 28 ] and a re-derivation below) is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

###### Example of @xmath:

Finally, take the case of @xmath , or the Abelian orbifold @xmath ,
studied in detail by [ 60 , 61 ] . The reader is referred to Figure 2.4
. Here, there are @xmath nodes and we expect the dimension of the master
space to be 6. Again, we can obtain @xmath from ( 2.2.2 ) and perform
primary decomposition on it. We see, using [ 68 ] , that there are 4
irreducible components, three of which are merely coordinate planes and
trivial. Along these directions the gauge theory admits an accidental
supersymmetry enhancement to @xmath and each direction can be viewed as
a Coulomb branch of the corresponding @xmath supersymmetric theory.

The non-trivial piece of @xmath is a Higgs branch and is an irreducible
variety which we shall call @xmath ; it is also of dimension 6.
Moreover, it is of degree 14, and is prescribed by the intersection of
15 quadrics in 12 variables. The Hilbert series for @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

###### Summary:

q We have therefore learned, from our few warm-up exercises, that one
can compute @xmath directly, its Hilbert series, dimension, degree,
etc., using the methods of computational algebraic geometry, using, in
particular, computer packages such as [ 68 ] . In general, the master
space @xmath need not be irreducible. We will see this in detail in the
ensuing sections. The smaller components are typically referred to as
Coulomb Branches of the moduli space.

The largest irreducible component of the master space @xmath will play a
special rôle in our analysis and deserves a special notation. We will
denote it @xmath . In the toric case, it is also known as the coherent
component of the master space. In all our examples, this component
actually has the same dimension as the full master space and, as we will
see in detail example by example and in general in section 2.6 , is in
fact Calabi-Yau. Let us redo Table 2.2 , now for the coherent component;
we present the result in Table 2.3 .

We note that the degree and dimension of @xmath is the same as that of
@xmath , again suggesting that the smaller dimensional components are
merely linear pieces. Nevertheless the linear pieces play a crucial rôle
in the analysis of the physics of these theories since there is a rich
structure of mixed Higgs and Coulomb branches; we will see this in § 2.5
. Moreover, we observe that the numerator now becomes symmetric
(palindromic), a remarkable fact that will persist throughout our
remaining examples; we will show why in section 2.6 .

### 2.3 Toric Presentation

We have so far seen the application of computational algebraic geometry
in studying the master space as an explicit algebraic variety. This
analysis has not fully exploited the fact that @xmath is in fact a toric
variety; that is, we have been simplifying and primary decomposing the
ideal corresponding to @xmath without utilizing its inherent
combinatorial, toric nature. Now, given an ideal @xmath of a polynomial
ring, when each generator of @xmath , i.e., each polynomial equation, is
written in the form “monomial = monomial,” then @xmath is known as a
toric ideal and the variety thus defined will be toric [ 70 ] . The
F-terms arising from the partials of the superpotential in ( 2.2.2 )
clearly obey this condition and this is true for all toric Calabi-Yau
spaces @xmath .

A single matrix can in fact encode all the information about the ideal
of @xmath , called the @xmath -matrix in [ 60 , 61 ] . For orbifolds of
the form @xmath with action @xmath the @xmath -matrix were constructed
in Eqs 4.1-3 of [ 59 ] and that of @xmath , in [ 60 , 61 ] (see also [
71 , 72 ] ). In general, the procedure is straight-forward: solve the
F-terms explicitly so that each field can be written as a fraction of
monomials in terms of a smaller independent set. Then, translate these
monomials as a matrix of exponents; this is the @xmath -matrix.

We have seen from above that the master space @xmath and its coherent
component @xmath of a toric @xmath quiver gauge theory is a variety of
dimension @xmath . The F-terms provide @xmath equations for the @xmath
fields in the quiver. Not all of them are algebraically independent,
since the F-terms are invariant under the @xmath toric action. It
follows that the @xmath fields can be parameterized in terms of @xmath
independent fields. @xmath is therefore a matrix of dimensions @xmath by
@xmath .

###### @xmath Revisited:

For the @xmath example above let us illustrate the procedure. Solving (
2.2.8 ), we have that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We see that there are 5 fields @xmath which parameterize all 9 fields,
signifying that @xmath is 5-dimensional, as stated above. Whence we can
plot the 9 fields in terms of the 5 independent ones as:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where we read each column as the exponent of the 5 solution fields. This
is the @xmath -matrix, and captures the toric information entirely. In
particular, the number of rows @xmath of the @xmath -matrix is the
dimension of @xmath and the columns of @xmath are the charge vectors of
the toric action of @xmath on @xmath .

The @xmath -matrix gives a nice toric presentation for the coherent
component @xmath of the master space. It defines an integer cone @xmath
in @xmath prescribed by the non-negative integer span of the columns of
@xmath . Then, in the language of [ 64 ] , @xmath as an algebraic
(toric) variety of dimension @xmath , is given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This is the generalization to @xmath dimensions of the construction of
toric varieties we have already explained in the previous chapter. The
cone generated by the @xmath matrix is just the dual cone @xmath in the
three dimensional language, and the columns of @xmath are the
multidimensional vectors corresponding to the generators of @xmath .

Now, the toric diagram of the variety is not, customarily, given by
@xmath , but, rather, by the dual cone @xmath ( this is the @xmath
dimensional generalization of the three dimensional fan described in the
previous chapter ). Let us denote the generators of @xmath as the matrix
@xmath , then, using the algorithm in [ 64 ] , we can readily find that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

@xmath is a matrix of dimensions @xmath by @xmath , where the number of
its columns, @xmath , is a special combinatorial number which is
specific to the particular toric phase [ 61 , 62 ] . We recall that the
dual cone consists of all lattice points which have non-negative inner
product with all lattice points in the original cone. In terms of our
dual matrices,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The columns of @xmath , plotted in @xmath , is then the toric diagram,
and the number of vectors needed to characterize the toric diagram in
@xmath is @xmath which for our particular case is equal to 6. The @xmath
matrix takes the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In fact, one can say much more about the product matrix @xmath , of
dimensions @xmath by @xmath : it consists of only zeros and ones. In [ 9
, 10 , 11 , 73 ] , it was shown that this matrix, which translates
between the linear sigma model fields and space-times fields, also
encodes perfect matchings of the dimer model description of the toric
gauge theory. This provides a more efficient construction of the master
space. We will return to a description of this in § 2.3.3 .

###### @xmath Revisited:

Next, let us construct the @xmath -matrix for our @xmath example. We
recall that the master space and its coherent component are of dimension
6. Using the superpotential ( 2.2.2 ) to obtain the 12 F-terms, we can
again readily solve the system and obtain

  -- -- -- ----------
           (2.3.18)
  -- -- -- ----------

giving us the toric diagram with 9 vectors in 6-dimensions as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

#### 2.3.1 Computing the Refined Hilbert Series

Let us now study the Hilbert series in the language of the @xmath
-matrix. We mentioned in section 2.2.1 that the Hilbert series should be
refined and we have already seen the @xmath example in ( 1.5.24 ). This
is easily done and is central to the counting of gauge invariants in the
plethystic programme. Recall that the master space @xmath and its
coherent component @xmath are given by a set of algebraic equations in
@xmath , where @xmath is the number of fields in the quiver. Since we
are dealing with a toric variety of dimension @xmath we have an action
of @xmath on @xmath and @xmath and we can give @xmath different weights
to the variables @xmath .

What should these weights be ? Now, all information about the toric
action is encoded in the matrix @xmath . Therefore, a natural weight is
to simply use the columns of @xmath ! There are @xmath columns, each
being a vector of charges of length @xmath , as needed, and we can
assign the @xmath -th column to the variable @xmath for @xmath . Since
each weight is a vector of length @xmath , we need a @xmath -tuple for
the counting which we can denote by @xmath . Because the dummy variable
@xmath keeps track of the charge, we can think of the components as
chemical potentials [ 23 , 28 ] . With this multi-index variable
(chemical potential) we can define the Refined Hilbert Series of @xmath
as the generating function for the dimension of the graded pieces:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath , the @xmath -th multi-graded piece of @xmath , can be
thought of as the number of independent multi-degree @xmath Laurent
monomials on the variety @xmath . A similar expression applies to @xmath
.

The refined Hilbert series for @xmath and @xmath can be computed from
the defining equations of the variety, using computer algebra program
and primary decomposition, as emphasized in [ 67 ] . In addition, for
the coherent component @xmath , there exists an efficient algorithm [ 74
] for extracting the refined Hilbert series from the matrix @xmath that
can be implemented in Macaulay2 [ 68 ] . The reader interested in the
actual code could look at [ 20 ] .

A crucial step in the above analysis seems to rely upon our ability to
explicitly solve the F-terms in terms of a smaller independent set of
variables. This may be computationally intense. For Abelian orbifolds
the solutions may be written directly using the symmetries of the group,
as was done in [ 59 , 60 ] ; in general, however, the @xmath -matrix may
not be immediately obtained. We need, therefore, to resort to a more
efficient method.

#### 2.3.2 The Symplectic Quotient Description

There is an alternative and useful description of the toric variety
@xmath as a symplectic quotient [ 64 ] . In the math language this is
also known as the Cox representation of a toric variety [ 75 ] and in
physics language, as a linear sigma model . We will review more
carefully this “alternative” construction of toric varieties in chapter
3 where it will be useful to understand the structure of line bundles
and divisors of a toric variety. In this chapter we will show that
thanks to this representation there exist a nice way of computing the
refined Hilbert series using the Molien invariant.

Now, the @xmath generators of the dual cone @xmath are not independent
in @xmath . The kernel of the matrix @xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

or, equivalently, the kernel of the matrix @xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

defines a set of charges for the symplectic action. The @xmath rows of
@xmath define vectors of charges for the @xmath fields in the linear
sigma model description of @xmath [ 59 , 60 , 64 ] :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

A crucial observation is that if the rows of @xmath sum to zero, then
@xmath is Calabi-Yau. In the following we will see that this is the case
for all the examples we will encounter. Indeed, it is possible to show
this is general; for clarity and emphasis we will leave the proof of the
fact to the section 2.6 and first marvel at this fact for the detailed
examples.

The refined Hilbert series for @xmath can be computed using the Molien
formula [ 28 , 76 ] , by projecting the trivial Hilbert series of @xmath
onto @xmath invariants. We will need in the following the refined
Hilbert series depending on some or all of the @xmath chemical
potentials @xmath and, therefore, we keep our discussion as general as
possible. The dependence on the full set of parameters @xmath is given
by using the Cox homogeneous coordinates for the toric variety [ 75 ] .
We introduce @xmath homogeneous variables @xmath with chemical
potentials @xmath acted on by @xmath with charges given by the rows of
@xmath . The Hilbert series for @xmath is freely generated and is
simply:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where we have written @xmath as a vector, in the notation of ( 2.3.20 ),
to indicate refinement, i.e., @xmath depends on all the @xmath ’s.

Next, the vector of charges of @xmath under the @xmath action is given
by @xmath . By introducing @xmath @xmath chemical potentials @xmath we
can write the Molien formula, which is a localization formula of the
Hilbert series from the ambient space to the embedded variety of
interest, as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.3.25)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

The effect of the integration on the @xmath chemical potentials @xmath
is to project onto invariants of the @xmath ’s. In this formula we
integrate over the unit circles in @xmath and we should take @xmath .

Due to the integration on the @xmath variables @xmath , the final result
for the Hilbert series depends only on @xmath independent combinations
of the parameters @xmath , which can be set in correspondence with the
@xmath parameters @xmath . We can convert the @xmath variables to the
set of independent @xmath chemical potential @xmath for the toric action
using the matrix @xmath as [ 75 ]

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Recall that the @xmath variables @xmath are the chemical potentials of
the @xmath elementary fields that have been chosen to parametrize @xmath
. The weight of the @xmath -th elementary field @xmath for @xmath under
this parameterization is given by the @xmath -th column of the matrix
@xmath . Denoting with @xmath the chemical potential for the @xmath -th
field we thus have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where we used @xmath .

Formula ( 2.3.26 ), or equivalently ( 2.3.27 ), allows us to determine
the parameters @xmath entering the Molien formula in terms of the
chemical potentials for the elementary fields of the quiver gauge
theory. This identification can be only done modulo an intrinsic @xmath
dimensional ambiguity parameterized by the matrix @xmath : @xmath are
determined by ( 2.3.26 ) up to vectors in the kernel of @xmath . We will
see in the next section that there is an efficient way of assigning
charges under the non-anomalous symmetries to the variables @xmath using
perfect matchings. In particular, if we are interested in the Hilbert
series depending on a single parameter @xmath , we can always assign
charge @xmath to the variables corresponding to external perfect
matchings and charge one to all the other variables. Let us now
re-compute the refined Hilbert series for the two examples studied
above, using ( 2.3.25 ). For simplicity, we compute the Hilbert series
depending on one parameter @xmath , referring to [ 20 ] for an example
of computation of the refined Hilbert series depending on all
parameters.

###### Symplectic Quotient for @xmath:

The kernel of the matrix @xmath , from ( 2.3.15 ), can be easily
computed to be the vector @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.28)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which forms the vector of charges for the linear sigma model description
of the master space for @xmath . In this description, therefore, we find
that the master space, which we recall to be irreducible, is given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We can compute the Hilbert series using the Molien formula ( 2.3.25 ).
For simplicity, we consider the Hilbert series depending on a single
chemical potential @xmath . This is obtained by assigning chemical
potential @xmath to all fields of the linear sigma model with negative
charge. This assignment of charges is consistent with formula ( 2.3.26 )
and, as we will see in the next section, is equivalent to assigning
@xmath to the three external perfect matchings and @xmath to the three
internal ones. We introduce a new chemical potential @xmath for the
@xmath charge and integrate on a contour slightly smaller than the unit
circle. Using the residue technique outlined in Section 3.2 of [ 27 ] ,
we find that the contribution to the integral comes from the pole at
@xmath , whence

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.30)
  -- -------- -- ----------

agreeing precisely with ( 2.2.10 ).

###### Symplectic Quotient for @xmath:

In this case the kernel for the matrix @xmath , from ( 2.3.19 ), is
three dimensional and it is encoded by the matrix:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.31)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The rows of @xmath induce a @xmath action on @xmath which allows us to
represent the coherent component of @xmath as a symplectic quotient:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.32)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We compute here the Hilbert series depending on a single parameter
@xmath . Formula ( 2.3.26 ) is consistent with assigning chemical
potential @xmath to the fields of the sigma model with negative charges
and chemical potential @xmath to all the others. As we will see in the
next section, this corresponds to the natural choice which assigns
@xmath to the external perfect matchings and @xmath to the internal
ones. The Molien formula reads

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.3.33)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

which agrees with ( 2.2.11 ) exactly. The computation of the refined
Hilbert series depending on all six parameters is deferred to [ 20 ] .

#### 2.3.3 Dimer Models and Perfect Matchings

As we have already explained It was recently realized that the most
convenient way of describing toric quiver gauge theories is that of
dimers and brane-tilings. In this section we will see a nice application
of this technology. Let us re-examine our above analysis using the
language of dimers and perfect matchings. As we have illustrated in the
previous chapter, a dimer or brane tiling associated to a gauge theory
living on a D3 brane at singularity is a bipartite graph, where to every
face is associated a gauge factor, to every edge a bifundamental fields,
and to every vertex a term in the superpotential with plus or minus sign
according to the color of the vertex, see for example Figure 2.2 . A
perfect matching is a subgraph of the dimer that contains all the nodes
in such a way that the set of edges don’t touch among themselves (see
Figure 2.2 ). The reader is referred to [ 9 , 10 , 11 , 73 ] and for a
comprehensive introduction, especially to [ 51 ] . We will focus on
perfect matchings and the matrix @xmath defined in ( 2.3.16 ). Now,
@xmath is of size @xmath with @xmath the number of fields, and @xmath
the number of gauge group factors. The matrix @xmath is of size @xmath ,
where @xmath is the number of generators of the dual cone. Thus, @xmath
is a matrix of size @xmath . The number @xmath is, equivalently, the
number of perfect matchings for the corresponding tiling (dimer model).
In fact, the matrix @xmath contains entries which are either @xmath or
@xmath , encoding whether a field @xmath in the quiver is in the perfect
matching @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.34)
  -- -------- -- ----------

###### Dimer Model for @xmath:

Let us first discuss in detail the example of @xmath . Using the @xmath
matrix in Equation ( 2.3.17 ) we can draw the 6 different perfect
matchings. They are shown in Figure 2.2 . The first three perfect
matchings are identified as the external perfect matchings @xmath while
the last three are the internal perfect matchings @xmath associated with
the internal point in the toric diagram of @xmath . For reference we
have also drawn the toric diagram, together with the multiplicity of the
gauged linear sigma model fields associated with the nodes, which we
recall from [ 61 , 62 ] . In fact, it is this multiplicity that led to
the formulation of dimers and brane tilings as originally discussed in
the first reference of [ 9 , 10 , 11 , 73 ] . Here we find another
important application of this multiplicity.

Now, from Figure 2.2 we notice that the collection of all external
perfect matchings cover all edges in the tiling. Similarly, the
collection of all internal perfect matchings cover all edges in the
tiling, giving rise to a linear relation which formally states @xmath ,
or as a homogeneous relation, @xmath . Since the @xmath matrix encodes
whether an edge is in a perfect matching, the linear combination of
matchings encodes whether an edge is in that linear combination. Using
the homogeneous form of the relation we in fact find that the vector
@xmath is in the kernel of @xmath and thus forms a row of the kernel
matrix @xmath . Since the rank of the matrix @xmath is equal to the
dimension of the master space, @xmath , we conclude that this is the
only element in the matrix @xmath . We have thus re-obtained the result
( 2.3.28 ).

###### Dimer Model for @xmath:

Next, let us look at the example of @xmath . The toric diagram, with
multiplicity 1, 2, 1, and the corresponding perfect matchings are shown
in Figure 2.3 , denoting the two external perfect matchings by @xmath
and those of the internal point by @xmath . A quick inspection of the
perfect matchings shows a linear relation @xmath , leading to a charge
matrix @xmath for the linear sigma model description of the master space
for the orbifold @xmath . As is computed in [ 27 , 28 ] and as we shall
later encounter in detail in 2.5.1 we find that the master space is
nothing but the conifold.

###### Dimer Model for @xmath:

The above arguments can also be used to compute the linear sigma model
description of the orbifold @xmath . The toric diagram, shown in Figure
2.4 , consists of 6 points, 3 external with perfect matchings @xmath ,
and 3 internal.

The 3 internal points form a local @xmath singularity and have
multiplicity 2. We find 6 internal perfect matchings @xmath . There are
3 sets of 3 points each, sitting on a line. Each such line is a @xmath
singularity and can therefore be used to write down a relation between
the 4 perfect matchings, giving rise to 3 conifold like relations,
@xmath . Thus the master space of the orbifold @xmath is an intersection
of 3 conifold-like (quadric) relations in @xmath , with a charge matrix

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.35)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which precisely agrees with Equation ( 2.3.31 ).

We see that we can find a diagrammatic way, using dimers and perfect
matchings, to find the charges of the matrix @xmath and thereby the
charges of the linear sigma model which describes the master space. This
description is good for a relatively small number of perfect matchings
and small number of fields in the quiver. When this number is large we
will need to refer to the computation using the kernel of the @xmath
matrix. We thus reach an important conclusion:

###### Observation 1

The coherent component of the master space of a toric quiver theory is
generated by perfect matchings of the associated dimer model.

We can easily make contact between the perfect matching description and
the more mathematical description of the master space outlined in the
previous section. As shown in [ 9 , 10 , 11 , 73 ] , the perfect
matchings @xmath parameterize the solutions of the F-terms condition
through the formula

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.36)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This equation determines the charges of the perfect matchings (modulo an
ambiguity given by @xmath ) in terms of the @xmath field theory charges.
In the previous section we introduced a homogeneous variable @xmath for
each perfect matching @xmath . We see that formula ( 2.3.26 ) for the
chemical potential of the field @xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.37)
  -- -------- -- ----------

following from the Cox description of the toric variety, nicely matches
with ( 2.3.36 ) obtained from the dimer description.

Finally, there is a very simple way of determining the non-anomalous
charges of the perfect matchings, which is useful in computations based
on the Molien formula. The number of non-anomalous @xmath symmetries of
a toric quiver gauge theory is precisely the number of external perfect
matchings, or equivalently, the number @xmath of external points in the
toric diagram. This leads to a very simple parameterization for the
non-anomalous charges [ 19 , 35 ] : assign a different chemical
potential @xmath for @xmath to each external perfect matching and assign
@xmath to the internal ones. It follows from ( 2.3.36 ) that this
prescription is equivalent to the one discussed in [ 19 , 35 ] . In
particular, in the computation of the Hilbert series depending on just
one parameter @xmath , we can assign chemical potential @xmath to all
the external matchings and @xmath to the internal ones, as we did in
section 2.3.2 .

### 2.4 Some non Orbifold Examples

Enriched by a conceptual grasp and armed with the computational
techniques for describing the master space, we would like to explore
some examples of non orbifold toric singularities. We will leave a more
extensive analysis of other singularities to the original literature [
20 ] . The following set of non orbifold examples will confirm the fact
that @xmath , for the @xmath quiver theory, is of dimension @xmath and
generically decomposes into several components: the top dimensional one
of which is also a Calabi-Yau variety of dimension @xmath , as well as
some trivial lower-dimensional linear pieces defined by the vanishing of
combinations of the coordinates.

#### 2.4.1 The Conifold

The conifold is the easiest example of non orbifold singularity. In the
case of just one brane @xmath it is extremely easy. Indeed the
superpotential of the gauge theory is trivial in the abelian case and
the four field @xmath , @xmath are just c-numbers and parametrize a copy
of @xmath . Hence @xmath is irreducible and trivially CY. Its Hilbert
series is simply:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.38)
  -- -------- -- ----------

#### 2.4.2 The Suspended Pinched Point

The next easier example of non-orbifold type of singularity is the
so-called suspended pinched point (SPP), first studied in [ 5 ] . The
toric and the quiver diagrams are presented in Figure 2.5 and the
superpotential is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.39)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The SPP singularity is the easiest example of a family of singularities
called the generalized conifolds. It is a near parent to the conifold
singularity, but, as we will see in a moment, it has a very rich
structure of moduli space.

The matrices @xmath , @xmath and @xmath can readily found to be

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.40)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In this example, we need to weight the variables appropriately by giving
weight @xmath to all external points in the toric diagram, as discussed
above:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.41)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In the actual algebro-geometric computation this means that we weigh the
variables of the polynomials with the above degrees and work in a
weighted space. Now, we find that the moduli space is a reducible
variety @xmath with Hilbert series:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.42)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.4.43)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

where, as in the previous chapter, we have used the standard algebraic
geometry notation that, given a set @xmath of polynomials, @xmath is the
variety corresponding to the vanishing locus of @xmath . The top
component @xmath is a toric variety of complex dimension 5 which is the
product of a conifold and a plane @xmath ; it has Hilbert series:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.44)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with a palindromic numerator, as was with the études studied above. The
other component @xmath is a plane isomorphic @xmath with Hilbert series:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.45)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The two irreducible components intersect in a @xmath plane with Hilbert
series:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.46)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We observe that the Hilbert series of the various components satisfy the
additive relation:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.47)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This is, of course, the phenomenon of “surgery” discussed in [ 25 ] .
This “surgery” property is generic for all the reducible moduli space.
We refer the reader to the original literature [ 20 ] for many other
examples of this property.

In the symplectic quotient description, we find that the kernel of the
@xmath -matrix is @xmath and hence @xmath . The symmetry group of the
coherent component is easily found to be @xmath , a rank 5 group as
expected from the toric property of this space. The non-Abelian part is
realized as the repetition of the charges, @xmath and @xmath ,
respectively.

#### 2.4.3 Cone over Zeroth Hirzebruch Surface

We continue with a simple toric threefold: the affine complex cone over
the zeroth Hirzebruch surface @xmath , which is simply @xmath . The
complex cone @xmath is a regular @xmath orbifold of the conifold, but it
presents a much more rich structure. The toric diagram is drawn in
Figure ( 2.6 ).

As already explained in chapter 1 to a given CY singularity @xmath
generically correspond more than just one field theory. These set of
field theory are different UV descriptions of the same IR superconformal
fixed manifold [ 61 , 77 ] . Indeed all the SCFT associated to a given
singularity are related by a chain of Seiberg dualities. The @xmath
theory is an example of this phenomena and has two toric/Seiberg (see
for example [ 78 , 79 ] ) dual phases, @xmath and @xmath , of the gauge
theory [ 61 , 62 ] , and the quivers and superpotentials are:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.48)
  -- -------- -- ----------

###### Toric Phase I:

We can readily find the F-terms from @xmath in ( 2.4.48 ) and using the
techniques outlined above, we can find the @xmath -matrix to be

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.49)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Whence, primary decomposition gives that there are three irreducible
pieces:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.50)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.51)
  -- -------- -- ----------

With weight @xmath to all 8 basic fields in the quiver the Hilbert
series of the total space is given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.52)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The top-dimensional component of @xmath is toric Calabi-Yau, and here of
dimension 6; this is consistent with the fact that the number of nodes
in the quiver is 4. Specifically, @xmath is the product of two conifolds
and it has Hilbert series (again with palindromic numerator):

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.53)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The two lower-dimensional components are simply @xmath , with Hilbert
series

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.54)
  -- -------- -- ----------

These two hyperplanes are, as mentioned above, Coulomb branches of the
moduli space, they intersect the @xmath along one of the two three
dimensional conifolds which have Hilbert series

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.55)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The Hilbert series of various components again satisfy the additive
surgical relation of [ 25 ] :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.4.56)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

For reference, the dual cone @xmath -matrix and the perfect matching
matrix @xmath are:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.57)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Subsequently, their kernel is @xmath , giving us

  -- -- -- ----------
           (2.4.58)
  -- -- -- ----------

The fact that the rows of @xmath sum to 0 means that the toric variety
is indeed Calabi-Yau. The symmetry of the coherent component is @xmath ,
suitable for a product of two conifolds. We note that the charge matrix
@xmath has 8 columns which are formed out of 4 pairs, each with two
identical columns. This repetition of columns in the charge matrix is
another way of determining the non-Abelian part of the symmetry group of
the coherent component.

###### Toric Phase II:

We can perform a similar analysis for the second toric phase which is a
Seiberg dual of the first. Note from ( 2.4.48 ) that the gauge-invariant
terms in @xmath now have a different number of fields; correspondingly,
we must thus assign different weights to the variables. The ones that
are composed of Seiberg dual mesons of the fields of the first toric
phase should be assigned twice the weight:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.59)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In the actual algebro-geometric computation this means that we weight
the variables of the polynomials with the above degrees and work in a
weighted space. Subsequently, we find that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.60)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The master space affords the primary decomposition @xmath with

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.61)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The Hilbert series is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.62)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We see that @xmath is composed of four irreducible components: a six
dimensional @xmath with the same Hilbert series of the product of two
conifolds:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.63)
  -- -------- -- ----------

@xmath is the biggest irreducible component and it has the same Hilbert
series ( 2.4.53 ) of @xmath : the biggest irreducible component of the
first toric phase.

The other three irreducible components are three four dimensional
complex planes each defined by the vanishing of 8 coordinates out of the
12 total. These planes intersect only at the origin of the coordinate
system and have the Hilbert series

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.64)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We see that @xmath has @xmath in the denominator instead of @xmath
because it is parameterized precisely by the coordinates of twice the
weight.

The three @xmath components and the @xmath component intersect in a
three dimensional conifold variety but with different grading of the
coordinates:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (2.4.65)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Once again, we have a surgery relation:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The dual cone @xmath -matrix and the perfect matching matrix @xmath are:

  -- -- -- ----------
           (2.4.67)
  -- -- -- ----------

Hence, the kernel is @xmath and we have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.4.68)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Again, the rows of @xmath sum to 0 and the toric variety is Calabi-Yau.
The second and third rows are conifold like relations and the first row
is a relation which is found for the master space of @xmath and is not
in the first phase of @xmath .

There are some important comments to do. We have seen that the master
space for two Seiberg equivalent gauge theories is not the same. In
particular the structure of the irreducible components and their
intersections change under Seiberg duality. A nice observation is that
the Hilbert series of the coherent components of the master space is
exactly the same.

We see here that a manifestation of Seiberg duality is in the fact that
the coherent component of each of the phases have the same Hilbert
series. In this section we used just the chemical potential @xmath , but
It is possible to check that the Hilbert series for @xmath for the
various Seiberg dual phases remain equal even if we refine them with all
the non anomalous global symmetries, while if we add also the anomalous
symmetries the Hilbert series are generically different [ 80 ] . We will
see the explicit example of @xmath in section 5.4.3 . Indeed it is
possible to verify in other examples that different toric phases of a
given Calabi-Yau singularity @xmath exhibit the same Hilbert series for
the coherent component @xmath of the master space [ 80 ] . This is going
to be our conjectured relation:

###### Conjecture 1

Quivers which are toric (Seiberg) duals have coherent component of the
master space with the same Hilbert series written in term of the non
anomalous charges of the gauge theories.

It would be interesting to understand the fate of the linear components
under Seiberg duality, and the explicit relation between the coherent
components of Seiberg dual gauge theories. For some progress along this
line we refere the reader to [ 80 ] .

##### Comments on Seiberg Dual Phases

It is important to note that our analysis of the moduli space is just
the classical analysis of the abelian moduli space of gauge theory:
namely we are considering the theory with just “ @xmath ” gauge factors
and imposing the classical F-flat conditions. There are a couple of
things that could go in the wrong direction: the Seiberg duality is a
non abelian duality, and its application to the abelian case is not
clear in principle; the classical F-term conditions can have some
quantum corrections that lift at least part of the classical moduli
space.

About the first problem we can say that in the examples studied in
literature there is a geometric extension of the Seiberg duality to the
case @xmath . Indeed in abelian case the Seiberg duality could be
interpreted as a geometric operation called toric duality. We observe
that all the previous claims done in literature about toric duality were
related just to the mesonic branch of the complete moduli space. For
such cases we have 2 different theories which have the same mesonic
moduli space, for any N, including @xmath . We now face a new situation
in which the full moduli space is discussed - both mesonic and baryonic,
on all of its components. Indeed in the previous section we analyzed the
@xmath gauge theory and we discovered that: @xmath and @xmath have the
same mesonic moduli space, coherent component with the same Hilbert
series for non anomalous @xmath charges, but the linear components of
the first phase are contained in the linear component of the second
phase. Does this qualify as Seiberg duality for @xmath ? Is it possible
to extend the geometric operations on the full moduli space? Observe
that for @xmath there are no quantum effect and no lifting. This is
correct since @xmath and @xmath are not Seiberg equivalent in Field
Theory sense. If toric duality applies, it is possible that it implies
some equivalence of the coherent components only. The @xmath case would
be the right laboratory: here the theory is non abelian and Seiberg
duality implies the equivalence of the full moduli space, including
linear components. But here come some computational problems. If we try
to compute the classical Hilbert series with the help of the package
Macaulay2 it get stacked and we are not able to obtain a result. As we
will see in the following chapters there exist another way for computing
Hilbert series: namely passing to the gravity dual of the @xmath
correspondence. This procedure give the Hilbert series for the complete
moduli space for all the values of @xmath . We will discover that it is
possible to apply this procedure only to the coherent component of the
moduli space.

A computation done in the gravity side in principle takes into account
all the strong coupling corrections. The fact that the gravity
computation is sensible only to the coherent component and that, in the
case just analyzed, the coherent components of two Seiberg dual theories
have the same Hilbert series, give us arguments to guess that the
conjecture 1 could be correct even at quantum level.

We hope to come back in the future on the problem of studying Seiberg
dualities in these classes of theories, but we can try to make an
heuristic analysis of the particular case of the @xmath gauge theory.
For more systematic, but still incomplete analysis, we refer the reader
to [ 80 ] . The linear components @xmath and @xmath of the second phase
of @xmath match well with the two linear components @xmath , @xmath of
the first phase of @xmath : they have the same dimension, the same
Hilbert series, the same intersection with the coherent component of the
master space. In the Hilbert series language these facts can be
summarized by the relation:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.4.69)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

The question is: what is the third linear branch of @xmath and why it
does not exist in @xmath . Maybe It could be possible to see that that
this kind of branch is lifted in the quantum theory for @xmath . The
branch @xmath for @xmath is parametrized only by the vevs of the dual
mesons generated by Seiberg duality. One could argue that, if for @xmath
there is a similar branch, it is lifted. First, generically in this
branch, all or part of the other fields get masses, leading to no other
obvious fixed point and to a theory which is still strongly coupled
where we could expect non trivial dynamics. Second, the situation is
remarkably similar to SQCD: we know that in the electric theory the
moduli space of SQCD is exact at classical level, while in the magnetic
theory the moduli space receives quantum corrections; in particular the
flat direction in the magnetic theory with zero vev for the dual quarks
and non zero vev for the dual mesons M (situation similar to @xmath ) is
partially lifted. A simple way to see it is: in the dual branch the F
terms @xmath allow flat directions with @xmath and with @xmath a generic
matrix @xmath by @xmath . However @xmath is dual to the electric meson
@xmath which is a @xmath by @xmath with maximum rank equal to @xmath ;
for this reason some components of @xmath should be lifted. As discussed
by Seiberg [ 81 ] these are lifted because @xmath gives mass to the dual
quarks reducing the effective number of flavor to @xmath and thus
generating non-perturbative corrections to the moduli space. Following
this line of reasoning one could expect that something similar happens
in @xmath . To reach this conclusion we need to make many assumptions:
we extrapolate Seiberg duality to @xmath and we focus on the gauge group
which undergoes duality ignoring all the others. The 2 by 2 matrix
@xmath with the four mesons @xmath along the branch @xmath should have
rank one: thus @xmath which is the equation of the conifold; this is
just the intersection of the linear branch with the coherent component,
as discussed in the previous section. So @xmath is partially lifted:
what remains is already contained in the big branch and it is not a new
branch of the theory. The above argument should be taken as an
indication of what we may expect for @xmath . It is a question whether
the other linear branches are partially lifted.

We would like to summarize the various possibilities for the “quantum”
master space: one possible expectation is that the branches of the
minimal phase of a CY are genuine branches also in the IR, but every
time we perform a Seiberg duality we introduce spurious flat directions.
This possibility has some motivations due to the above discussion in
field theory.

Another possible expectation is that just the coherent component of the
moduli space is invariant under Seiberg duality, while all the other
components are lifted by “quantum” correction. This possibility has some
justifications in the dual gravity picture, where, as we will see in the
following, the counting of D3 brane states dual to BPS operators seems
to see just the coherent component of the master space.

A third possibility, the one we will support, is that even the coherent
component of the master space is not invariant under Seiberg duality,
but only its Hilbert series written just in term of the non abelian
@xmath symmetries is and invariant of the duality transformation.

Clearly a much more careful investigation must be done. In section 5.4.3
we will make some other comments, and in [ 80 ] we analyse some related
topics.

### 2.5 Linear Branches of Moduli Spaces

¿From the previous sections we learn that the master space @xmath of an
@xmath quiver gauge theory on a toric singularity @xmath generically
presents a reducible moduli space. This fact could appear surprising.
Indeed the @xmath supersymmetric gauge theories are the classical
examples of theories with reducible moduli spaces. These theories
present two well separated branches: the Higgs branch and the Coulomb
branch. Moving along these different branches has a well defined
characterization both in terms of the geometry of the moduli space and
in terms of the VEV structure of the gauge theory. It would be
interesting to have a similar interpretation in this more generic setup.

In the case of just @xmath brane on the tip of the conical singularity
@xmath , the reducibility of @xmath follows easily from the toric
condition. Indeed, the equations defining @xmath are of the form
“monomial @xmath monomial”, whereby giving us toric ideals as discussed
in section 2.3 . Let us embed this variety into @xmath with coordinates
@xmath , then its algebraic equations have the form:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.5.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath runs over the number of polynomials defining the variety
and the polynomials @xmath are irreducible. If some @xmath is different
from zero the variety is reducible and is given by the union of the zero
locus of @xmath together with a set of planes (linear components) @xmath
given by the zero locus of the factorized part in ( 2.5.1 ).

Hence, the master space @xmath could be the union of a generically
complicated @xmath dimensional variety with a set of smaller dimensional
varieties that are generically linear varieties @xmath parameterized by
combinations of the coordinates ³ ³ 3 The reducibility of the moduli
space could persist for @xmath (see section 5.5 and [ 28 ] for some
examples) and it would be interesting to have a clearer geometric
picture even in these more complicated cases. In this section we will
concentrate on the @xmath case. ; this is certainly true for the cases
studied in the above section 2.4 , and for the other examples presented
in [ 20 ] . It would be nice to give a gauge theory interpretation to
these smaller dimensional linear branches.

We will try to give a nice picture for these planes, looking at the
first phase of @xmath . The reader is referred to [ 20 ] for more
examples. The lesson we will learn is that these planes of the master
space could parametrize flows in the gauge theory . Specifically, there
may be chains of flows from one irreducible component of the master
space of a theory to another. The archetypal example which will be the
terminus of these flows will be the gauge theory on a D3-brane probing
the Calabi-Yau singularity @xmath , to which we alluded in section 2.3.3
. Let us first briefly review this theory, continuing along the same
vein as our discussions in section 2.2.1 .

#### 2.5.1 The @xmath Singularity

The quiver gauge theory for @xmath has @xmath supersymmetry with two
vector multiplets and two bi-fundamental hyper-multiplets. In @xmath
notation we have six chiral multiplets denoted as @xmath , with a
superpotential

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.5.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and the quiver and toric diagrams are given in Figure 2.7 .

The master space @xmath of the theory can be easily found to be

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.5.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Now, @xmath is clearly reducible and decomposes into the following two
irreducible components as @xmath with

  -- -- -- ---------
           (2.5.4)
  -- -- -- ---------

Specifically, @xmath is @xmath , where the @xmath is defined by @xmath
and the conifold singularity @xmath is described by the chiral fields
@xmath with the constraint @xmath . The component @xmath is parametrized
by the fields @xmath . These two branches meet on the complex line
parametrized by @xmath .

The field theory interpretation of these two branches is standard:
moving in @xmath we are giving VEV to the scalars in the vector
multiplet and hence we call @xmath the Coulomb branch; while moving in
@xmath we are giving VEV to the scalars in the hyper-multiplets and
hence we call @xmath the Higgs branch.

Let us take @xmath as our main example and let us revisit the
reducibility its master space trying to give it a gauge theory
interpretation.

#### 2.5.2 The Linear Branches of @xmath and its IR Flows

Let us start by re-examining @xmath , encountered in section 2.4.3 . We
recall from ( 2.4.50 ) that the master space @xmath is the union of
three branches: the biggest one is six dimensional and is the set
product of two conifold singularities, i.e., @xmath , and the two
smallest ones are two copies of @xmath , parametrized respectively by
the VEV of @xmath and @xmath .

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.5.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Looking at the toric diagram one can understand the possible flows of
the gauge theory. Indeed we remind the reader that the prescription is
as follows [ 60 , 61 , 82 ] . If one toric diagram is derived by
deleting external vertices of the other, then the associated gauge
theories can flow one into the other. Geometrically this is blowing up
the singularity, while in the gauge theory a FI term is turned on and as
a consequence gives VEV to some chiral fields, for a product of @xmath
gauge groups; or a baryonic VEV is turned on in the case of product of
@xmath gauge groups. It is indeed possible to associate fields of the
gauge theory to each vertex in the toric diagram, as shown in Figure 2.8
. The deleted vertex can be associated with the fields that are getting
a VEV.

Using this prescription one can easily understand that the gauge theory
can flow to the one associated to the @xmath singularity in four
different ways by giving VEV to one out of the four possible sets of
fields: @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath . In this way the linear
components of the master space will flow among themselves according to
the scheme:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (2.5.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Once arrived at the fixed point one can move along the Coulomb branch of
the IR theory giving VEV respectively to the set of fields: @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath that parametrize the linear component @xmath of
the master space of the SCFT at @xmath singularity. Hence, along the two
smaller branches of the moduli space the theory admits an accidental
@xmath supersymmetry and the theory moves along the Coulomb branch of
the resulting gauge theory. Giving vev to the field belonging to tha
linear components, the hyperplanes of the UV theory flow into the
hyperplanes of the IR theory. This is a situation that is going to
repeat in many other examples, and we refer the reader to [ 20 ] for a
more comprehensive explanation.

### 2.6 The Master Space: Hilbert Series and CY Geometry

We have studied, with examples for toric theories and just one physical
D3-branes (look [ 20 ] for more examples), the algebraic variety formed
by the F-flatness equations. We have seen that in general this is a
reducible variety, with a top Calabi-Yau component of dimension @xmath .
In this section we recapitulate and deepen the properties of the
coherent component @xmath of the master space @xmath . We study some
properties of its Hilbert series and we give a demonstration that @xmath
is always a @xmath dimensional CY.

###### As a Higher-Dimensional Calabi-Yau:

The most suggestive property is that @xmath is always a @xmath
dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold . This has been explicitly checked in
all the examples we have discussed. It is simple to check the Calabi-Yau
condition in the linear sigma model description, since it corresponds
there to the fact that the vectors of charges in @xmath are traceless,
or equivalently, the toric diagram has all the vectors ending on the
same hyper-plane.

There is a remarkably simple proof that @xmath is Calabi-Yau which
emphasizes the rôle of perfect matchings. Recall from [ 9 , 10 , 11 , 73
] and section 2.3.3 that the quiver gauge theory has a description in
terms of a dimer model, this is a bi-partite tiling of the two torus,
with @xmath white vertices and @xmath black vertices, where @xmath is
the number of superpotential terms. The elementary fields of the quiver
correspond to the edges in the tiling, each of which connects a black
vertex to a white one. Now, by definition, a perfect matching is a
choice of fields/dimers that cover each vertex precisely once. In
particular, a perfect matching contains exactly @xmath dimers,
connecting the @xmath black vertices to the @xmath white ones. Since the
columns of the matrix @xmath , of size @xmath , tell us which
fields/dimers occur in a given perfect matching we have the nice
identity

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.6.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which basically counts the number of edges in each perfect matching.

By multiplying this equation on the right by the matrix kernel @xmath of
@xmath , @xmath , we obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.6.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and we conclude that the vector of charges of the linear sigma model,
which are the rows of the matrix @xmath , are traceless. This proves
that @xmath is Calabi-Yau.

We again see that the prefect matchings description is crucial in our
understanding of the properties of the master space. As explained in
section 2.3.3 , the perfect matchings generates the coherent component
of the master space.

###### Palindromic Hilbert Series:

An intriguing property of the Hilbert series for @xmath is its symmetry.
As manifest from all our examples, the numerator of the Hilbert series
(in second form) for @xmath is a polynomial in @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.6.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with symmetric coefficients @xmath . This means that there is a
remarkable symmetry of the Hilbert series for @xmath under @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.6.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the modular weight @xmath depends on @xmath .

A polynomial with such a symmetry between its consecutively highest and
lowest coefficients @xmath is known as a palindromic polynomial . A
beautiful theorem due to Stanley [ 83 ] states the following

###### Theorem 2.6.1

The numerator to the Hilbert series of a graded Cohen-Macaulay domain
@xmath is palindromic iff @xmath is Gorenstein.

What this means, for us, is that the coordinate ring of the affine
variety @xmath must be Gorenstein. However, an affine toric variety is
Gorenstein precisely if its toric diagram is co-planar, i.e., it is
Calabi-Yau (cf. e.g. § 4.2 of [ 5 ] ). Thus we have killed two birds
with one stone: proving that @xmath is affine toric Calabi-Yau above
from perfect matchings also shows that the numerator of its Hilbert
series has the palindromic symmetry.

As we will see in chapter 6 , this symmetry extends to the refined
Hilbert series written in terms of the R-charge parameter @xmath and
chemical potentials for a global symmetry @xmath . Although @xmath has
been up to now Abelian, we will see that in some special cases of
theories with hidden symmetries @xmath becomes non Abelian. Introducing
chemical potentials @xmath for Cartan sub-algebra of @xmath , we will
write the refined Hilbert series as a sum over @xmath -characters in the
general form,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.6.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where PE is the plethystic exponential function already introduced in
section 1.5.2 , computing symmetric products on a set of generators of
the coherent component. The refined Hilbert series is now invariant
under the the combined action of @xmath and charge conjugation, @xmath .
We will see examples in chapter 6 .

### 2.7 Summary and Discussions

We have enjoyed a long theme and variations in @xmath , touching upon
diverse motifs. Let us now part with a recapitulatory cadence. We have
seen that for a single brane, the master space is the algebraic variety
formed by the space of F-terms and it coincide with the moduli space of
the gauge theory @xmath . In the case of the singularity @xmath which
the D3-brane probes being a toric Calabi-Yau threefold, we have a wealth
of techniques to study @xmath : direct computation, toric cones via the
@xmath and @xmath matrices, symplectic quotients in the Cox coordinates
as well as dimer models and perfect matchings. Using these methods we
have learned that

-   @xmath is the mesonic branch of the full moduli space @xmath of a
    single D3-brane gauge theory and is the symplectic quotient of
    @xmath by the Abelian D-terms;

-   For a @xmath toric quiver theory, @xmath is a variety of dimension
    @xmath ;

-   The master space @xmath is generically reducible, its top
    dimensional component, called the coherent component @xmath , is a
    Calabi-Yau variety, of the same dimension and degree as @xmath . The
    lower-dimensional components are generically linear pieces @xmath ,
    composed of coordinate hyperplanes;

-   The coherent component @xmath can be quite explicitly characterized.
    Denoting, as usual, with @xmath the number of fields in the quiver,
    @xmath the number of nodes in the quiver and with @xmath the number
    of perfect matchings in the dimer realization of the gauge theory,
    we have defined three matrices:

    -   A @xmath matrix @xmath obtained by solving the F-terms in terms
        of a set of independent fields. The columns give the charges of
        the elementary fields under the @xmath action; in a more
        mathematical language, they give the semi-group generators of
        the dual cone @xmath in the toric presentation for @xmath :

          -- -------- -- ---------
             @xmath      (2.7.1)
          -- -------- -- ---------

    -   A @xmath matrix @xmath , defined by @xmath , and representing
        the cone @xmath dual to @xmath . The columns are the @xmath
        toric vectors of the @xmath dimensional variety @xmath . We see
        that the number of perfect matchings in the dimer realization of
        the quiver theory is the number of external points in the toric
        diagram for @xmath . This generalizes the fact that the external
        perfect matchings are related to the external points of the
        toric diagram for the three dimensional transverse Calabi-Yau
        space @xmath .

    -   A @xmath matrix @xmath which defines the perfect matchings as
        collections of elementary fields.

-   The variety @xmath also has a linear sigma model, or symplectic
    quotient, description as

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (2.7.2)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    where @xmath is the kernel of the matrices @xmath and @xmath .

-   @xmath is generated by the perfect matchings in the dimer model
    (brane tiling) corresponding to the quiver theory;

-   In the field theory, @xmath often realizes as the Higgs branch, and
    the hyper-planes @xmath , the Coulomb branch of the moduli space
    @xmath . The acquisition of VEVs by the fields parameterizing @xmath
    can cause one theory to flow to another via the Higgs mechanism; we
    have illustrated the flows of the @xmath theory, but another
    archetypal example is the chain of @xmath theories [ 20 ] ;

-   Under Seiberg/toric duality, we conjecture that the Hilbert series
    for @xmath , refined with all the non anomalous symmetries of the
    field theory, remains invariant;

-   According to the plethystic program, the Hilbert series of @xmath is
    the generating function for the BPS mesonic operators. In order to
    count the full chiral BPS operators, including mesons and baryons,
    we need to find the refined (graded by various chemical potentials)
    Hilbert series of @xmath ;

-   The Hilbert series of the various irreducible pieces of @xmath ,
    obtained by primary decomposition, obey surgery relations;

-   The numerator of the Hilbert series of @xmath , in second form, is
    palindromic;

-   The gauge theory possesses hidden global symmetries corresponding to
    the symmetry of @xmath which, though not manifest in the Lagrangian,
    is surprisingly encoded in the algebraic geometry of @xmath .

In Table 2.4 , we illustrate some of the above points with a select
class of examples. We present the single-brane master space, its
coherent component (by name if familiar), the associated Hilbert series
as well as the global symmetry, standard as well as hidden. Some of the
examples in the table were not computed in this thesis and we refer to
the original literature [ 20 ] .

For a general number @xmath of D3-branes, the situation is more subtle.
The moduli space is now the variety of F-flatness quotiented by the
special unitary factors of the gauge group, so that when quotiented by
the @xmath factors as a symplectic quotient we once more arrive at the
mesonic branch, which here is the @xmath -th symmeterized product of the
Calabi-Yau space @xmath . A direct attack to the problem of generic
@xmath seems very difficult, however, in the following chapter we will
learn to construct the Hilbert series of the moduli space @xmath for
generic @xmath number of branes, and to extract from these generating
functions very important informations. In particular we will learn how
to encode the representation of the hidden symmetries, observed in the
@xmath case for the coherent component @xmath of the master space, in
the plethystic exponential. Indeed, we will learn to re-write the terms
of the single brane generating function, i.e., the refined Hilbert
series, of @xmath in the weights of the representations of the Lie
algebra of the hidden symmetry in a selected set of examples. Via the
plethystic exponential, this extends to an arbitrary number @xmath of
branes. This fact will give us the possibility to extend the analysis of
symmetries of the moduli space to the generic non abelian case.

Before coming back to study properties of the moduli space for generic
@xmath we need to learn how to count the complete spectrum of BPS
operators. This counting problem will take us busy for the next three
chapters, after them we will be able to come back to the problem of
studying the moduli space @xmath for generic @xmath number of branes.

## Chapter 3 Counting BPS D3 Branes and BPS Baryonic Operators

In the previous chapter we developed a good understanding of the moduli
space @xmath of a D3 brane sitting at the singularity @xmath . If we
really want to understand the supersymmetric properties of these SCFT we
need to do two other major steps: study the spectra of @xmath BPS
operators and study the non abelian case: namely generic number of
branes @xmath . It will turn out that the properties of the moduli space
@xmath for generic @xmath are very well described by the counting of
@xmath BPS operators.

The set of @xmath BPS operators are nothing else that the coordinate
ring of the algebraic variety @xmath . The algebraic geometry tells that
there exist a one to one correspondence between an algebraic variety and
its coordinate ring. This means that if we will be able to get
informations regarding the @xmath BPS operators for generic @xmath ,
then we will be able to get informations regarding the moduli space
@xmath for generic @xmath . The study of the counting procedure will
take us busy for long, but in the meanwhile we will learn how the
geometric informations of the singularity @xmath are encoded in the
spectrum of the SCFT and how to map strong coupling counting to weak
coupling counting using the AdS/CFT correspondence.

Our analysis of the counting procedure will be spread over the following
three chapters. The first and the present one have a more geometric
approach, the second one will have a more field theory approach, while
in the last one we will try to give a synthesis of the two approaches to
formulate a general recipe for counting @xmath BPS gauge invariant
operators for generic number of branes @xmath and for generic toric
conical CY singularity @xmath .

In this chapter we start this long trip studying supersymmetric D3 brane
configurations wrapping internal cycles of type IIB backgrounds @xmath
for a generic Sasaki-Einstein manifold H. We will show that these
configurations correspond to BPS baryonic operators in the dual quiver
gauge theory using the AdS/CFT conjecture. In each sector with given
baryonic charge, we write explicit partition functions counting all the
BPS operators according to their flavor and R-charge. This result will
be completely general and will reduce to the mesonic counting in the
particular case of zero baryonic charges, showing that the results we
have intuitively explained in the first chapter are consistent.

We also show how to extract geometrical information about H from the
partition functions; in particular, we give general formulae for
computing the volume of H and of all non trivial three cycles in H.
¿From these volumes one can obtain the strong coupling value of the
central charge and of all the R charges of the SCFT.

### 3.1 Generalities

The study of @xmath states in quantum field theory and in string theory
is clearly a very important topic. These states are generically
protected against quantum corrections and contain information regarding
the strong coupling behavior of supersymmetric field theories and
superstring theories. In the past years they were especially important
in the study of strong weak dualities, like the AdS/CFT conjecture [ 2 ]
which gives a connection between the @xmath operators in conformal field
theories and @xmath states in string theory.

In this chapter we discuss the set of one half @xmath states in string
theory realized as @xmath branes wrapped on (generically non trivial)
three cycles in the supergravity background @xmath , where @xmath is a
Sasaki-Einstein manifold [ 6 , 5 , 7 ] . These states are
holographically dual to baryonic @xmath operators in @xmath four
dimensional @xmath s [ 84 ] , which are quiver gauge theories.

Recently there has been some interest in counting @xmath states in the
@xmath s dual to CY singularities [ 85 , 86 , 87 , 88 , 23 , 89 ] . As
we have already anticipated in chapter 1 , and we will better appreciate
in the present chapter, the partition function counting mesonic @xmath
gauge invariant operators according to their flavor quantum numbers
contains a lot of information regarding the geometry of the @xmath [ 23
, 22 ] , including the algebraic equations of the singularity. Quite
interestingly, it also provides a formula for the volume of @xmath [ 22
] . This geometrical information has a direct counterpart in field
theory, since, according to the @xmath correspondence, the volume of the
total space and of the three cycles are duals to the central charge and
the @xmath charges of the baryonic operators respectively [ 84 , 90 ] .

The countings in the mesonic gauge invariant sector of the @xmath is not
too difficult and basically correspond of counting the spectra of
holomorphic function over the cone @xmath . Geometrically these
corresponds to consider giant graviton configurations [ 91 ]
corresponding to @xmath @xmath branes wrapped on trivial three cycles in
@xmath . In this chapter we analyze the generic baryonic @xmath
operators, corresponding to @xmath branes wrapped on generically non
trivial three cycles inside @xmath . We succeed in counting @xmath
states charged under the baryonic charges of the field theory and we
write explicit partition functions at fixed baryonic charges. This is
the first step to write down the complete partition functions and it
reduce to the mesonic case once we fix all the baryonic charges equal to
zero. We investigate in details their geometrical properties. In
particular we will show how to extract from the baryonic partition
functions a formula for the volume of the three cycles inside @xmath and
for the volume of @xmath itself. We will mostly concentrate on the toric
case but our procedure seems adaptable to the non toric case as well.
The results of this chapter will be fundamental for the following ones
in which we will manage to construct the complete partition functions.

The chapter is organized as follows. In Section 3.2 we review some basic
elements of toric geometry related to line bundles and divisors that
will be very useful in the following discussion. In Section 3.3 we
formulate the general problem of describing and quantizing the @xmath
@xmath brane configurations. We will use homomorphic surfaces to
parameterize the supersymmetric @xmath configurations of @xmath brane
wrapped in @xmath , following results in [ 92 , 93 ] . In the case where
@xmath is a toric variety we have globally defined homogeneous
coordinates @xmath which are charged under the baryonic charges of the
theory and which we can use to parametrize these surfaces. We will
quantize configurations of D3 branes wrapped on these surfaces and we
will find the Hilbert space of @xmath states using a prescription found
by Beasley [ 93 ] . The complete @xmath Hilbert space factorizes in
sectors with definite baryonic charges. Using toric geometry tools, we
can assign to each sector a convex polyhedron @xmath . The BPS operators
in a given sector are in one-to-one correspondence with symmetrized
products of N (number of colors) integer points in @xmath . In Section
3.4 we discuss the assignment of charges and we set the general counting
problem. In Section 3.5 we make some comparison with the field theory
side. In Section 3.6 , we will write a partition function @xmath
counting the integer points in @xmath and a partition function @xmath
counting the integer points in the symmetric product of @xmath . Here we
will see how the plethystic function @xmath appears as a fundamental
step in the counting problems. We will take the conifold as an easy
explanatory example and we will give for it a geometric prescription to
compute the partition function for all the scalar BPS operators.

¿From @xmath , taking a suitable limit, we will be able to compute the
volume of @xmath and of all the three cycles in @xmath , and we will put
in relation these results with the central charge and the R charges of
the field theory, as described in Section 3.7 . Although we mainly focus
on the toric case the general prescriptions can be applied to every
conical CY singularity, and the formula for the computation of the
volume of the three cycles, and of @xmath are valid in general. The
extension to the non toric case is more a technical problem than a
conceptual one.

¿From the knowledge of @xmath we can reconstruct the complete partition
function for the chiral ring of quiver gauge theories. This is a quite
hard problem in field theory, since we need to count gauge invariant
operators modulo F-term relations and to take into account the finite
number of colors @xmath which induces relations among traces and
determinants. The geometrical computation of @xmath allow to by-pass
these problems as we will explicitly see in the next chapters.

In this chapter we will mainly focus on the geometrical properties of
the partition functions @xmath , although some preliminary comparison
with the dual gauge theory is made in Section 3.5 . In forthcoming
chapters, we will show how to compute the complete partition function
for selected examples and how to compare with field theory expectations
[ 27 , 28 ] .

### 3.2 Divisors and Line Bundles in Toric Geometry

Before starting our discussion about D3 brane embedding we need to
review some basic topics of toric geometry. As often happens for a
single phenomena there exist different descriptions, and some
descriptions are more comfortable for the understanding of certain
properties of the phenomena. Toric geometry admits different
descriptions, we will not interested in exploring all the possible
descriptions, and we refer to the literature for extensive explanations
[ 64 , 75 ] . Two description of toric geometry are very useful for us:
the first one presents a toric variety as an intersection in some
ambient space and find it physical realizations for example in the study
of the moduli space of CFT @xmath , @xmath . We have already explained
its general structure and its applications in chapters 1 ; the second
one describe a toric variety as a symplectic quotient. We have already
seen this description in the study of the coherent component of the
moduli space @xmath and its refined Hilbert series in section 2.3.2 .

In this section we plan to study a bit deeply its properties and in
particular how to describe divisors and line bundles on toric varieties.
As we will see this second description is very well suited for the
counting problem.

As we have already explained in the first chapter a toric variety @xmath
is defined by a fan @xmath : a collection of strongly convex rational
polyhedral cones in the real vector space @xmath ( @xmath is an @xmath
dimensional lattice @xmath ). Some examples are presented in Figure 3.1
.

Starting from these data we can construct a toric variety as a complex
intersection following the procedure we have already explained in
previous chapters, or as a symplectic quotient, as presented in 2.3.2
and explained in the following. The two procedures are equivalent, but
the symplectic quotient construction is more useful for what we are
going to discuss in this chapter. We define the variety @xmath as a
symplectic quotient [ 64 , 75 ] . Consider the one dimensional cones of
@xmath and a minimal integer generator @xmath of each of them. Call the
set of one dimensional cones @xmath . Assign a “homogeneous coordinate”
@xmath to each @xmath . If @xmath dim @xmath , @xmath span @xmath .
Consider the group

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which acts on @xmath as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

@xmath is isomorphic, in general, to @xmath times a discrete group. The
continuous part @xmath can be described as follows. Since @xmath the
@xmath are not linearly independent. They determine @xmath linear
relations:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath and @xmath generate a @xmath action on @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath .

For each maximal cone @xmath define the function @xmath and the locus
@xmath as the intersection of all the hypersurfaces @xmath . Then the
toric variety is defined as:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

There is a residual @xmath complex torus action acting on @xmath , from
which the name toric variety . In the following, we will denote with
@xmath the real torus contained in @xmath .

In all the examples we will consider in this chapter @xmath and the
previous quotient is interpreted as a symplectic reduction. The case
where @xmath contains a discrete part includes further orbifold
quotients. These cases can be handled similarly to the ones discussed in
this chapter as we will see some examples in the following chapters.

Using these rules to construct the toric variety, it is easy to recover
the usual representation for @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the the minimal integer generators of @xmath are @xmath , @xmath
and @xmath (see Figure 3.1 for the case @xmath ).

We will be interested in affine toric varieties, where the fan is a
single cone @xmath = @xmath . In this case @xmath is always the null
set. It is easy, for example, to find the symplectic quotient
representation of the conifold:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and we have
written @xmath for the action of @xmath with charges @xmath .

This type of description of a toric variety is the easiest one to study
divisors and line bundles. Each @xmath determines a @xmath -invariant
divisor @xmath corresponding to the zero locus @xmath in @xmath . @xmath
-invariant means that @xmath is mapped to itself by the torus action
@xmath (for simplicity we will call them simply divisors from now on).
The @xmath divisors @xmath are not independent but satisfy the @xmath
basic equivalence relations:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath with @xmath is the orthonormal basis of the dual lattice
@xmath with the natural paring: for @xmath , @xmath @xmath @xmath .
Given the basic divisors @xmath the generic divisor @xmath is given by
the formal sum @xmath with @xmath . Every divisor @xmath determines a
line bundle @xmath ¹ ¹ 1 The generic divisor @xmath on an affine cone is
a Weyl divisor and not a Cartier divisor [ 64 ] ; for this reason the
map between divisors and line bundles is more subtle, but it can be
easily generalized using the homogeneous coordinate ring of the toric
variety @xmath [ 75 ] in a way that we will explain. With an abuse of
language, we will continue to call the sheaf @xmath the line bundle
associated with the divisor @xmath . .

There exists a simple recipe to find the holomorphic sections of the
line bundle @xmath . Given the @xmath , the global sections of @xmath
can be determined by looking at the polytope (a convex rational
polyhedron in @xmath ):

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath . Using the homogeneous coordinate @xmath it is easy to
associate a section @xmath to every point @xmath in @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Notice that the exponent is equal or bigger than zero. Hence the global
sections of the line bundle @xmath over @xmath are:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

At this point it is important to make the following observation: all
monomials @xmath have the same charges under the @xmath described at the
beginning of this Section (in the following these charges will be
identified with the baryonic charges of the dual gauge theory). Indeed,
under the @xmath action we have:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where we have used equation ( 3.2.3 ). Similarly, all the sections have
the same charge under the discrete part of the group @xmath . This fact
has an important consequence. The generic polynomial

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is not a function on @xmath , since it is not invariant under the @xmath
action (and under possible discrete orbifold actions). However, it makes
perfectly sense to consider the zero locus of @xmath . Since all
monomials in @xmath have the same charge under @xmath , the equation
@xmath is well defined on @xmath and defines a divisor ² ² 2 In this
way, we can set a map between linearly equivalent divisors and sections
of the sheaf @xmath generalizing the usual map in the case of standard
line bundles. .

#### 3.2.1 A Simple Example

After this general discussion, let us discuss an example to clarify the
previous definitions.

Consider the toric variety @xmath . The fan @xmath for @xmath is
generated by:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The three basic divisors @xmath correspond to @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
and they satisfy the following relations (see equation ( 3.2.5 )):

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and hence @xmath . All line bundles on @xmath are then of the form
@xmath with an integer @xmath , and are usually denoted as @xmath . It
is well known that the space of global holomorphic sections of @xmath is
given by the homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath for @xmath , while
it is empty for negative @xmath . We can verify this statement using the
general construction with polytopes.

Consider the line bundle @xmath associated with the divisor @xmath . In
order to construct its global sections we must first determine the
polytope @xmath ( @xmath ):

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Then, using ( 3.2.7 ), it easy to find the corresponding sections:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

These are the homogeneous monomials of order one over @xmath . Indeed we
have just constructed the line bundle @xmath (see Figure 3.2 ).

Consider as a second example the line bundle @xmath . In this case the
associated polytope is:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Using ( 3.2.7 ) it is easy to find the corresponding sections:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

These are all the homogeneous monomials of degree @xmath over @xmath ;
we have indeed constructed the line bundle @xmath (see Figure 3.2 ).

The examples of polytopes and line bundles presented in this Section are
analogous to the ones that we will use in the following to characterize
the @xmath baryonic operators. The only difference (due to the fact that
we are going to consider affine toric varieties) is that the polytope
@xmath will be a non-compact rational convex polyhedron, and the space
of sections will be infinite dimensional.

### 3.3 BPS D3 Brane Configurations

We could in principle attack the problem of counting the BPS operators
for generic @xmath directly in field theory, following the line of the
previous chapter. The mathematical branch that take care of this problem
is the invariant theory and essentially it consist in finding the set of
invariant under the action of some group acting on the elements of a
ring of polynomials subject to a set of constrains on its generators.
The constraints are given by the F-flat equations of the gauge theory
while the group action is just the gauge group action of the field
theory. In sections 4.7.1 , 5.5 we will see some applications of
invariant theory. This way to construct Hilbert series meets some
difficult computational problems already at small rank of the gauge
group. It is essentially very difficult to go over @xmath . We will like
to have a generic structure for the Hilbert series for arbitrary @xmath
. In section 1.5.2 we learnt that to compute Hilbert series of the
mesonic moduli space for generic @xmath it is enough to count the
holomorphic functions over the @xmath times symmetric product of the
transverse space @xmath to the system of D3 brane. As we will see in the
following [ 92 ] the set of all the holomorphic function of the variety
@xmath parametrize the set of all possible trivial D3 brane embedding in
@xmath . These objects are in one to one correspondence to all the
possible supersymmetric D3 branes wrapping a trivial three cycle in
@xmath and spinning like a relativistic particle in the @xmath space.
These are all the set of giant gravitons in @xmath and according to the
AdS/CFT correspondence they are dual to the set of all mesonic operators
in the field theory.

¿From this specific example and from the computational difficulties of
the field theoretic approach we will look to the dual geometry, and to
the set of states dual to all the @xmath BPS operators of the gauge
theory. Looking at the gravity dual of the gauge theory we will reach
two main results: a generic formulation of the Hilbert series counting
the BPS spectra for generic @xmath ; and the structure of the chiral
ring of the gauge theory at strong coupling.

In this Section we discuss the prescription [ 93 ] for determining the
BPS Hilbert space corresponding to supersymmetric D3 brane
configurations. We generalize the example of the conifold presented in [
93 ] to the case of a generic toric Calabi-Yau cone.

#### 3.3.1 Motivations

Consider the supersymmetric background of type @xmath supergravity
@xmath with @xmath a Sasaki-Einstein manifold. This geometry is obtained
by taking the near horizon geometry of a stack of @xmath @xmath on the
isolated Goreinstein singularity of a local Calabi-Yau three-fold given
by the real cone @xmath over the base @xmath . The D3 branes fill the
four dimensional Minkowski space-time @xmath in @xmath .

The dual superconformal field theory is a quiver gauge theory with gauge
group @xmath . Due to the presence of @xmath type groups these theories
have generically baryonic like operators inside their spectrum and these
are the objects we are interested in.

Let us take the field theory dual to the conifold singularity as a basic
example. We are already familiar with this theory from the previous
chapters. The theory has gauge group @xmath and chiral superfields
@xmath , @xmath that transform under the fundamental of the first gauge
group and under the anti-fundamental of the second one, and @xmath ,
@xmath that transform under the conjugate representation. There exists
also a non-abelian global symmetry @xmath under which the @xmath fields
transform as @xmath and the @xmath as @xmath . The superpotential is
@xmath . It is known that this theory has one baryonic charge and that
the @xmath fields have charge one under this symmetry and the @xmath
fields have charge minus one. Hence one can build the two basic baryonic
operators:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (3.3.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

These operators are clearly symmetric in the exchange of the @xmath and
@xmath respectively, and transform under @xmath and @xmath
representation of @xmath . The important observation is that these are
the baryonic operators with the smallest possible dimension: @xmath .
One can clearly construct operator charged under the baryonic symmetry
with bigger dimension in the following way. Defining the operators [ 94
, 93 ] ³ ³ 3 which are totally symmetric in the @xmath indices due to
the F-term relations @xmath , @xmath .

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

the generic type @xmath baryonic operator is:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

One can clearly do the same with the type @xmath operators.

Using the tensor relation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

depending on the symmetry of ( 3.3.17 ), one can sometimes factorize the
operator in a basic baryon times operators that are neutral under the
baryonic charge [ 94 , 93 ] .

It is a notorious fact that the @xmath correspondence maps the basic
baryonic operators ( 3.3.1 ) to static @xmath branes wrapping specific
three cycles of @xmath and minimizing their volumes. The volumes of the
@xmath branes are proportional to the dimension of the dual operators in
@xmath . Intuitively, the geometric dual of an operator ( 3.3.17 ) is a
fat brane wrapping a three cycle, not necessarily of minimal volume, and
moving in the @xmath geometry (we will give more rigorous arguments
below). If we accept this picture the factorisable operators in field
theory can be interpreted in the geometric side as the product of
gravitons/giant gravitons states with a static @xmath brane wrapped on
some cycle, and the non-factorisable ones are interpreted as excitation
states of the basic @xmath branes or non-trivial brane configurations.

We would like to generalize this picture to a generic conical @xmath
singularity @xmath . Using a nice parametrization of the possible @xmath
brane @xmath configurations in the geometry found in [ 92 , 93 ] , we
will explain how it is possible to characterize all the baryonic
operators in the dual @xmath , count them according to their charges and
extract geometric information regarding the cycles.

#### 3.3.2 Supersymmetric D3 Branes

Consider supersymmetric @xmath branes wrapping three-cycles in @xmath .
There exists a general characterization of these types of configurations
[ 92 , 93 ] that relates the @xmath -branes wrapped on @xmath to
holomorphic four cycles in @xmath . The argument goes as follows.
Consider the euclidean theory on @xmath . It is well known that one
@xmath -brane wrapping a holomorphic surface @xmath in @xmath preserves
supersymmetry. If we put @xmath @xmath -branes on the tip of the cone
@xmath and take the near horizon limit the supergravity background
becomes @xmath where @xmath is the euclidean version of @xmath . We
assume that @xmath intersects @xmath in some three-dimensional cycle
@xmath . The @xmath @xmath brane wrapped on @xmath looks like a point in
@xmath and like a line in @xmath : it becomes a brane wrapped on a
four-dimensional manifold in @xmath where @xmath is the geodesic in
@xmath obtained from the radial direction in @xmath . Using the @xmath
global symmetry of @xmath we can rotate @xmath into any other geodesic
in @xmath . For this reason when we make the Wick rotation to return to
Minkowski signature (this procedure preserves supersymmetry) we may
assume that @xmath becomes a time-like geodesic in @xmath spacetime. In
this way we have produced a supersymmetric @xmath brane wrapped on a
three cycle in @xmath which moves along @xmath in @xmath . Using the
same argument in the opposite direction, we realize also that any
supersymmetric @xmath brane wrapped on @xmath can be lifted to a
holomorphic surface @xmath in @xmath .

Due to this characterization, we can easily parametrize the classical
phase space @xmath of supersymmetric @xmath brane using the space of
holomorphic surfaces in @xmath without knowing the explicit metric on
the Sasaki-Einstein space @xmath (which is generically unknown!).

The previous construction characterizes all kind of supersymmetric
configurations of wrapped D3 branes. These include branes wrapping
trivial cycles and stabilized by the combined action of the rotation and
the RR flux, which are called giant gravitons in the literature [ 91 ] .
Except for a brief comment on the relation between giant gravitons and
dual giant gravitons, we will be mostly interested in D3 branes wrapping
non trivial cycles. These correspond to states with non zero baryonic
charges in the dual field theory. The corresponding surface @xmath in
@xmath is then a non trivial divisor, which, modulo subtleties in the
definition of the sheaf @xmath , can be written as the zero locus of a
section of @xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

##### The Toric Case

The previous discussion was general for arbitrary Calabi-Yau cones
@xmath . ¿From now on we will mostly restrict to the case of an affine
toric Calabi-Yau cone @xmath . For this type of toric manifolds the fan
@xmath described in Section 3.2 is just a single cone @xmath , due to
the fact that we are considering a singular affine variety. Moreover,
the Calabi-Yau nature of the singularity requires that all the
generators of the one dimensional cone in @xmath lie on a plane; this is
the case, for example, of the conifold pictured in Figure 3.1 . We can
then characterize the variety with the convex hull of a fixed number of
integer points in the plane: the toric diagram (Figure 3.3 ). For toric
varieties, the equation for the D3 brane configuration can be written
quite explicitly using homogeneous coordinates. As explained in Section
3.2 , we can associate to every vertex of the toric diagram a global
homogeneous coordinate @xmath . Consider a divisor @xmath . All the
supersymmetric configurations of D3 branes corresponding to surfaces
linearly equivalent to @xmath can be written as the zero locus of the
generic section of @xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As discussed in Section 2, the sections take the form of the monomials (
3.2.7 )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and there is one such monomial for each integer point @xmath in the
polytope @xmath associated with @xmath as in equation ( 3.2.6 )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

As already noticed, the @xmath are only defined up to the rescaling (
3.2.4 ) but the equation @xmath makes sense since all monomials have the
same charge under @xmath (and under possible discrete orbifold actions).
Equation ( 3.3.20 ) generalizes the familiar description of
hypersurfaces in projective spaces @xmath as zero locus of homogeneous
polynomials. In our case, since we are considering affine varieties, the
polytope @xmath is non-compact and the space of holomorphic global
sections is infinite dimensional.

We are interested in characterizing the generic supersymmetric @xmath
brane configuration with a fixed baryonic charge. We must therefore
understand the relation between divisors and baryonic charges: it turns
out that there is a one-to one correspondence between baryonic charges
and classes of divisors modulo the equivalence relation ( 3.2.5 ) ⁴ ⁴ 4
In a fancy mathematical way, we could say that the baryonic charges of a
D3 brane configuration are given by an element of the Chow group @xmath
. . We will understand this point by analyzing in more detail the @xmath
action defined in Section 3.2 .

##### The Assignment of Charges

To understand the relation between divisors and baryonic charges, we
must make a digression and recall how one can assign @xmath global
charges to the homogeneous coordinates associated to a given toric
diagram [ 16 , 12 , 35 , 19 ] .

Non-anomalous @xmath symmetries play a very important role in the dual
gauge theory and it turns out that we can easily parametrize these
global symmetries directly from the toric diagram. In a sense, we can
associate field theory charges directly to the homogeneous coordinates.

As explained in chapter 1 for a background with horizon @xmath , we
expect @xmath global non-anomalous symmetries, where @xmath is number of
vertices of the toric diagram ⁵ ⁵ 5 More precisely, @xmath is the number
of integer points along the perimeter of the toric diagram. Smooth
horizons have no integer points along the sides of the toric diagram
except the vertices, and @xmath coincides with the number of vertices.
Non smooth horizons have sides passing through integer points and these
must be counted in the number @xmath . . We can count these symmetries
by looking at the number of massless vectors in the @xmath dual. And in
chapter 1 we obtained that the global abelian non anomalous symmtries
are @xmath , where the first three @xmath s come from the reduction of
the metric along the isometries of @xmath , while the other factors come
from the the reduction of the RR four form fields over the non trivial
three cycles in H.

In this paper we use the fact that the @xmath non-R symmetry global
non-anomalous charges can be parametrized by @xmath parameters @xmath ,
each associated with a vertex of the toric diagram (or a point along an
edge), satisfying the constraint:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The @xmath baryonic charges are those satisfying the further constraint
[ 12 ] :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the vectors of the fan @xmath have the form @xmath with @xmath the
coordinates of integer points along the perimeter of the toric diagram.

The R-symmetries are parametrized with the @xmath in a similar way of
the other non-baryonic global symmetry, but they satisfy the different
constraint

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

due to the fact that the terms in the superpotential must have @xmath
-charges equal to two.

Now that we have assigned trial charges to the vertices of a toric
diagram and hence to the homogeneous coordinates @xmath , we can return
to the main problem of identifying supersymmetric D3 branes with fixed
baryonic charge. Comparing equation ( 3.2.3 ) with equation ( 3.3.22 ),
we realize that the baryonic charges @xmath in the dual field theory are
the charges @xmath of the action of @xmath on the homogeneous
coordinates @xmath . We can now assign a baryonic charge to each
monomials made with the homogeneous coordinates @xmath . All terms in
the equation ( 3.3.20 ) corresponding to a D3 brane wrapped on @xmath
are global sections @xmath of the line bundle @xmath and they have all
the same @xmath baryonic charges @xmath ; these are determined only in
terms of the @xmath defining the corresponding line bundle (see equation
( 3.2.9 )).

Using this fact we can associate a divisor in @xmath to every set of
@xmath baryonic charges. The procedure is as follows. Once we have
chosen a specific set of baryonic charges @xmath we determine the
corresponding @xmath using the relation @xmath . These coefficients
define a divisor @xmath . It is important to observe that, due to
equation ( 3.2.3 ), the @xmath are defined only modulo the equivalence
relation @xmath corresponding to the fact that the line bundle @xmath is
identified only modulo the equivalence relations ( 3.2.5 ) @xmath . We
conclude that baryonic charges are in one-to-one relation with divisors
modulo linear equivalence.

For simplicity, we only considered continuous baryonic charges. In the
case of varieties which are orbifolds, the group @xmath in equation (
3.2.1 ) contains a discrete part. In the orbifold case, the quantum
field theory contains baryonic operators with discrete charges. This
case can be easily incorporated in our formalism as we will see in
chapter 5 .

##### The Quantization Procedure

Now we want to quantize the classical phase space @xmath using geometric
quantization [ 95 ] following [ 93 ] .

Considering that @xmath and @xmath with @xmath vanish on the same locus
in @xmath , it easy to understand that the various distinct surfaces in
@xmath correspond to a specific set of @xmath with @xmath modulo the
equivalence relation @xmath : this is a point in the infinite
dimensional space @xmath in which the @xmath are the homogeneous
coordinates. Thus we identify the classical configurations space @xmath
of supersymmetric @xmath brane associated to a specific line bundle
@xmath as @xmath with homogeneous coordinates @xmath . A heuristic way
to understand the geometric quantization is the following. We can think
of the @xmath brane as a particle moving in @xmath and we can associate
to it a wave function @xmath taking values in some holomorphic line
bundle @xmath over @xmath . The reader should not confuse the line
bundle @xmath , over the classical phase space @xmath of wrapped D3
branes, with the lines bundles @xmath , which are defined on @xmath .
Since all the line bundles @xmath over a projective space are determined
by their degree (i.e. they are of the form @xmath ) we have only to find
the value of @xmath . This corresponds to the phase picked up by the
wave function @xmath when the @xmath brane goes around a closed path in
@xmath . Moving in the phase space @xmath corresponds to moving the
@xmath brane in @xmath . Remembering that a @xmath brane couples to the
four form field @xmath of the supergravity and that the backgrounds we
are considering are such that @xmath , it was argued in [ 93 ] that the
wave function @xmath picks up the phase @xmath and @xmath . For this
reason @xmath and the global holomorphic sections of this line bundle
over @xmath are the degree @xmath polynomials in the homogeneous
coordinates @xmath .

Since the @xmath wave functions are the global holomorphic sections of
@xmath , we have that the @xmath Hilbert space @xmath is spanned by the
states:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This is Beasley’s prescription.

We will make a correspondence in the following between @xmath and
certain operators in the field theory with one (or more) couple of free
gauge indices

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the @xmath are operators with fixed baryonic charge. The generic
state in this sector @xmath will be identify with a gauge invariant
operator obtained by contracting the @xmath with one (or more) epsilon
symbols. The explicit example of the conifold is discussed in details in
[ 93 ] : the homogeneous coordinates with charges @xmath can be put in
one-to-one correspondence with the elementary fields @xmath which have
indeed baryonic charge @xmath . The use of the divisor @xmath (modulo
linear equivalence) allows to study the BPS states with baryonic charge
@xmath . It is easy to recognize that the operators @xmath in equation (
4.5.29 ) have baryonic charge @xmath and are in one-to-one
correspondence with the sections of @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The BPS states @xmath are then realized as all the possible
determinants, as in equation ( 3.3.17 ).

#### 3.3.3 Giant Gravitons and Dual Giant Gravitons

Among the @xmath line bundles there is a special one: the bundle of
holomorphic functions @xmath ⁶ ⁶ 6 Clearly there are other line bundles
equivalent to @xmath . For example, since we are considering Calabi-Yau
spaces, the canonical divisor @xmath is always trivial and @xmath . . It
corresponds to the supersymmetric @xmath brane configurations wrapped on
homologically trivial three cycles @xmath in @xmath (also called giant
gravitons [ 91 ] ). Indeed we now understand that the counting procedure
for the mesonic spectra of the field theory, intuitively explained in
chapter 1 , is indeed the counting of all the possible giant gravitons
in the dual string theory background @xmath .

When discussing trivial cycles, we can parameterize holomorphic surfaces
just by using the embedding coordinates ⁷ ⁷ 7 These can be also
expressed as specific polynomials in the homogeneous coordinates such as
that their total baryonic charges are zero. . Our discussion here can be
completely general and not restricted to the toric case. Consider the
general Calabi-Yau algebraic affine varieties @xmath that are cone over
some compact base @xmath (they admit at least a @xmath action @xmath ).
These varieties are the zero locus of a collection of polynomials in
some @xmath space. We will call the coordinates of the @xmath the
embedding coordinates @xmath , with @xmath . The coordinate rings @xmath
of the varieties @xmath are the restriction of the polynomials in @xmath
of arbitrary degree on the variety @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the @xmath -algebra of polynomials in @xmath variables
and @xmath are the defining equations of the variety @xmath . We are
going to consider the completion of the coordinate ring (potentially
infinity polynomials) whose generic element can be written as the
(infinite) polynomial in @xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

restricted by the algebraic relations @xmath ⁸ ⁸ 8 There exist a
difference between the generic baryonic surface and the mesonic one: the
constant @xmath . The presence of this constant term is necessary to
represent the giant gravitons, but if we take for example the constant
polynomial @xmath this of course does not intersect the base @xmath and
does not represent a supersymmetric @xmath brane. However it seems that
this is not a difficulty for the quantization procedure [ 93 , 87 ] .

At this point Beasley’s prescription says that the @xmath Hilbert space
of the giant gravitons @xmath is spanned by the states

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.28)
  -- -------- -- ----------

These states are holomorphic polynomials of degree @xmath over @xmath
and are obviously symmetric in the @xmath . For this reason we may
represent ( 3.3.28 ) as the symmetric product:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Every element @xmath of the symmetric product is a state that represents
a holomorphic function over the variety @xmath . This is easy to
understand if one takes the polynomial @xmath and consider the relations
among the @xmath induced by the radical ideal @xmath (in a sense one has
to quotient by the relations generated by @xmath ). For this reason the
Hilbert space of giant gravitons is:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.30)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Obviously, we could have obtained the same result in the toric case by
applying the techniques discussed in this Section. Indeed if we put all
the @xmath equal to zero the polytope @xmath reduces to the dual cone
@xmath of the toric diagram, whose integer points corresponds to
holomorphic functions on @xmath [ 22 ] . Indeed in the toric case we
reproduce the structure of the mesonic chiral ring we claimed in the
chapter 1 . Namely the mesonic chiral ring is the set of all @xmath
times symmetric holomorphic function over @xmath . Given the expression
3.3.30 we can claim that the mesonic moduli space of the field theory is
@xmath times the symmetric product of the geometric singularity @xmath .
We have obtained this result in the dual gravity description of the
gauge theory and indeed this result is a strong coupling result. To make
this statement completely rigorous we need to have a clearer matching
between the giant gravitons in string theory and the mesonic operators
in the gauge theory. This match will be done in section 3.5 .

There exist another set of D3 brane configurations in @xmath that can be
considered dual to the mesonic operators in the field theory. These
configurations are called dual giant gravitons and consist of D3 branes
wrapped on a three-sphere in @xmath and spinning along the Reeb
direction. In [ 89 ] it was shown that the Hilbert space of a dual giant
graviton @xmath in the background space @xmath , where @xmath is a
generic Sasaki-Einstein manifold, is the space of holomorphic functions
@xmath over the cone @xmath . A single dual giant graviton reproduce
just the abelian structure of the field theory, and to have informations
regarding the non abelian case we need to construct the gran canonical
ensemble of N dual giant gravitons. At the end of the day what come out
is that the Hilbert space of N dual giant gravitons @xmath is the N
times symmetric product of holomorphic functions over @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.31)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In the discussion in literature there is the observations that giant
gravitons and dual giant gravitons are in some sense dual to each other.
At this point it is easy to understand in complete generality this
duality:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.32)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and indeed this is the reason why the counting of @xmath @xmath giant
graviton states and dual giant graviton states give the same result [ 87
, 88 ] : the counting of @xmath @xmath mesonic state in field theory.

This section was a bit technical, it is therefore worthwhile to make the
point

###### Summary:

we have learned that every line bundle over @xmath individuate a
topological embedding for a supersymmetric D3 brane in H. Every section
of the given line bundle distinguishes the actual BPS embedding inside
the given topological class. A quantum state of a D3 brane is given by
the N time symmetric product of sections of the particular line bundle.
These states are the ones to be matched with the BPS operators. If the
line bundle is non trivial the three cycle wrapped in H by the D3 brane
is non trivial and the operator dual to the D3 brane states will be a
baryonic operator, otherwise the three cycle will be trivial and the
dual operator will be a mesonic operator.

### 3.4 Flavor Charges of the BPS Baryons

In the previous Section, we discussed supersymmetric @xmath brane
configurations with specific baryonic charge. Now we would like to
count, in a sector with given baryonic charge, the states with a given
set of flavor charges @xmath and @xmath -charge @xmath . The generic
state of the @xmath Hilbert space ( 3.3.24 ) is, by construction, a
symmetric product of the single states @xmath . These are in a one to
one correspondence with the integer points in the polytope @xmath ,
which correspond to sections @xmath . As familiar in toric geometry [ 64
, 75 ] , a integer point @xmath contains information about the charges
of the @xmath torus action, or, in quantum field theory language, about
the flavor and @xmath charges.

Now it is important to realize that, as already explained in Section 3.3
, the charges @xmath that we can assign to the homogeneous coordinates
@xmath contain information about the baryonic charges (we have already
taken care of them) but also about the flavor and @xmath charges in the
dual field theory. If we call @xmath with @xmath the two flavor charges
and @xmath the @xmath -charge, the section @xmath has flavor charges
(compare equation ( 3.2.7 )):

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.4.33)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and @xmath -charge:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.4.34)
  -- -------- -- ----------

All the singularity @xmath have a special vector @xmath called the Reeb
vector. It is constant in norm over all @xmath and parametrizes the
isometry of @xmath dual to the R symmetry in the field theory. It is the
vector field that move the killing spinor @xmath of the CY @xmath :
@xmath , and it can be expanded over a basis @xmath of the @xmath toric
fibration: @xmath .

Making use of the Reeb vector it is possible to refine the last formula
( 3.4.34 ). Indeed the @xmath , which are the R-charges of a set of
elementary fields of the gauge theory [ 12 , 35 ] ⁹ ⁹ 9 The generic
elementary field in the gauge theory has an R-charge which is a linear
combination of the @xmath [ 35 , 19 ] . , are completely determined by
the Reeb vector of @xmath and the vectors @xmath defining the toric
diagram [ 18 ] . Moreover, it is possible to show that @xmath [ 35 , 19
] , where @xmath specifies how the Reeb vector lies inside the @xmath
toric fibration @xmath . Hence:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.4.35)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This formula generalizes an analogous one for mesonic operators [ 50 ] .
Indeed if we put all the @xmath equal to zero the polytope @xmath
reduces to the dual cone @xmath of the toric diagram [ 22 ] . We know
that the elements of the mesonic chiral ring of the @xmath correspond to
integer points in this cone and they have @xmath -charge equal to @xmath
. In the case of generic @xmath , the right most factor of ( 3.4.35 ) is
in a sense the background @xmath charge: the @xmath charge associated to
the fields carrying the non-trivial baryonic charges. In the simple
example of the conifold discussed in subsection 3.3.1 , formula ( 3.4.35
) applies to the operators ( 3.3.16 ) where the presence of an extra
factor of @xmath takes into account the background charge. In general
the R charge ( 3.4.35 ) is really what we expect from an operator in
field theory that is given by elementary fields with some baryonic
charges dressed by “mesonic insertions”.

The generic baryonic configuration is constructed by specifying @xmath
integer points @xmath in the polytope @xmath . Its @xmath charge @xmath
is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.4.36)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This baryon has @xmath times the baryonic charges of the associated
polytope. Recalling that at the superconformal fixed point dimension
@xmath and @xmath -charge of a chiral superfield are related by @xmath ,
it is easy to realize that the equation ( 3.4.36 ) is really what is
expected for a baryonic object in the dual superconformal field theory.
Indeed if we put all the @xmath equal to zero we have (this means that
we are putting to zero all the mesonic insertions)

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.4.37)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This formula can be interpreted as follows. The elementary divisor
@xmath can be associated with (typically more than one) elementary field
in the gauge theory, with R charge @xmath . By taking just one of the
@xmath different from zero in formula ( 3.4.37 ), we obtain the
dimension of a baryonic operator in the dual field theory: take a fixed
field, compute its determinant and the dimension of the operator is
@xmath times the dimension of the individual fields. These field
operators correspond to @xmath branes wrapped on the basic divisors
@xmath and are static branes in the @xmath background ¹⁰ ¹⁰ 10 The
generic configuration of a @xmath brane wrapped on a three cycle @xmath
in @xmath is given by a holomorphic section of @xmath that is a
non-homogeneous polynomial under the @xmath -charge action. For this
reason, and holomorphicity, it moves around the orbits of the Reeb
vector [ 92 , 93 ] . Instead the configuration corresponding to the
basic baryons is given by the zero locus of a homogeneous monomial
(therefore, as surface, invariant under the @xmath -charge action), and
for this reason it is static. . They wrap the three cycles @xmath
obtained by restricting the elementary divisors @xmath at @xmath . One
can also write the @xmath in terms of the volume of the Sasaki-Einstein
space @xmath and of the volume of @xmath [ 84 ] :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.4.38)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Configurations with more than one non-zero @xmath in equation ( 3.4.37 )
correspond to basic baryons made with elementary fields whose R-charge
is a linear combination of the @xmath (see [ 35 , 19 ] ) or just the
product of basic baryons.

The generic baryonic configuration has @xmath times the @xmath -charge
and the global charges of the basic baryons (static branes which
minimize the volume in a given homology class) plus the charges given by
the fattening and the motion of the three cycle inside the geometry (the
mesonic fluctuations on the @xmath brane or ‘‘mesonic insertions’’ in
the basic baryonic operators in field theory). It is important to notice
that the BPS operators do not necessarily factorize in a product of
basic baryons times mesons ¹¹ ¹¹ 11 In the simple case of the conifold
this is due to the presence of two fields @xmath with the same gauge
indices; only baryons symmetrized in the indices @xmath factorize [ 94 ,
93 ] . In more general toric quiver gauge theories it is possible to
find different strings of elementary fields with the same baryonic
charge connecting a given pair of gauge groups; their existence prevents
the generic baryons from being factorisable. .

#### 3.4.1 Setting the Counting Problem

In Section 3.6 we will count the baryonic states of the theory with
given baryonic charges (polytope @xmath ) according to their @xmath and
flavor charges. Right now we understand the space of classical
supersymmetric @xmath brane configurations @xmath as a direct sum of
holomorphic line bundles over the variety @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.4.39)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the @xmath specify the baryonic charges. We have just decomposed
the space @xmath into sectors according to the grading given by the
baryonic symmetry. Geometrically, this is just the decomposition of the
homogeneous coordinate ring of the toric variety under the grading given
by the action of @xmath . Now, we want to introduce a further grading.
Inside every line bundle there are configurations with different flavor
and @xmath charges corresponding to different sections of the same line
bundle.

Once specified the baryonic charges, the Hilbert space of BPS operators
is the @xmath order symmetric product of the corresponding line bundle.
Hence the @xmath @xmath Hilbert space is also decomposed as:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.4.40)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We would like to count the baryonic operators of the dual @xmath with a
given set of flavor and @xmath charges. We can divide this procedure
into three steps:

-   find a way to count the global sections of a given holomorphic line
    bundle (a baryonic partition function @xmath );

-   write the total partition function for the @xmath -times symmetric
    product of the polytope @xmath (the partition function @xmath ).
    This corresponds to find how many combinations there are with the
    same global charges @xmath (with @xmath for the flavor charges and
    @xmath for the @xmath charge ) for a given baryonic state: the
    possible set of @xmath such that:

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (3.4.41)
      -- -------- -- ----------

-   write the complete @xmath partition function of the field theory by
    summing over all sectors with different baryonic charges. Eventually
    we would also like to write the complete @xmath partition function
    of the field theory including all the @xmath charges at a time:
    @xmath baryonic, @xmath flavor and @xmath @xmath charges [ 27 , 28 ]
    .

In the following Sections, we will solve completely the first two steps.
The third step is complicated by various facts. First of all the
correspondence between the homogeneous coordinates and fields carrying
the same @xmath charges is not one to one. From the gravity side of the
@xmath correspondence one can explain this fact as follow [ 12 ] . The
open strings attached to a @xmath brane wrapped on the non-trivial three
cycles corresponding to the basic baryons in the dual field theory have
in general many supersymmetric vacuum states. This multiplicity of vacua
corresponds to the fact that generically the first homotopy group of the
three cycles @xmath is non-trivial and one can turn on a locally flat
connection with non-trivial Wilson lines. The different Wilson lines
give the different open string vacua and these are associated with
different elementary fields @xmath (giving rise to basic baryons @xmath
with the same global charges). One has then to include non trivial
multiplicities for the @xmath when computing the complete BPS partition
function. Moreover one should pay particular attention to the sectors
with higher baryonic charge. All these issues and the determination of
the partition function depending on all the @xmath charges are discussed
in [ 27 , 28 ] , and will be review them in the following two chapters.

### 3.5 A First Comparison with the Field Theory Side

At this point it is probably worthwhile to make a more straight contact
with the field theory. This is possible at least for all toric CY
because the dual quiver gauge theory is known [ 9 , 10 , 13 , 11 ] . In
this chapter we will mainly focus on the partition function @xmath for
supersymmetric D3 brane configurations. In forthcoming chapters we will
show how to compute the partition function for the chiral ring and how
to compare with the full set of BPS gauge invariant operators. In this
Section we show that, for a selected class of polytopes @xmath , there
is a simple correspondence between sections of the line bundle @xmath
and operators in the gauge theory.

As previously explained the gauge theory dual to a given toric
singularity is completely identified by the dimer configuration , or
brane tiling [ 9 , 10 , 13 , 11 ] . There is a general recipe for
assigning baryonic, flavors and R charges to the elementary fields for a
minimal toric phase of the @xmath [ 16 , 12 , 35 , 19 ] . As described
in Section ( 3.3.2 ), we can parameterize all charges with @xmath
numbers @xmath , @xmath associated with the vertices of the toric
diagram subject to the constraint ( 3.3.21 ) in case of global
symmetries and ( 3.3.23 ) in case of R symmetries. Every elementary
field can be associated with a brane wrapping a particular divisor

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.5.42)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and has charge @xmath ¹² ¹² 12 Call @xmath the set of all the unordered
pairs of vectors in the @xmath web (the @xmath web is the set of vectors
@xmath perpendicular to the edges of the toric diagram and with the same
length as the corresponding edge); label an element of @xmath with the
ordered indexes @xmath , with the convention that the vector @xmath can
be rotated to @xmath in the counter-clockwise direction with an angle
@xmath . With our conventions @xmath , where with @xmath we mean the
determinant of the @xmath matrix. One can associate with any element of
@xmath the divisor @xmath and a type of chiral field in the field theory
with multiplicity @xmath and global charge equal to @xmath [ 35 , 19 ] .
The indexes @xmath , @xmath are always understood to be defined modulo
@xmath . . Various fields have the same charge; as mentioned in the last
part of the Section 3.4 , this multiplicity is due to the non-trivial
homotopy of the corresponding cycles. Explicit methods for computing the
charge of each link in the dimer are given in [ 12 , 35 ] and the reader
is refer to these papers for an exhaustive list of examples. In Figure
3.4 we report the easiest example of the conifold.

With this machinery in our hands we can analyze the the field theory
operators corresponding to the @xmath brane states analyzed in the
previous Sections. The first thing to understand is the map between the
section @xmath of the line bundle we are considering and the field
theory operators. The case of the trivial line bundle is well known: the
corresponding polytope is the cone of holomorphic functions which are in
one-to-one correspondence with mesonic operators. The latter are just
closed loops in the quiver. It is possible to construct a map between
closed loops in the quiver and points in the cone of holomorphic
functions; it can be shown that closed loops mapped to the same point in
the cone correspond to mesons that are @xmath -term equivalent [ 54 , 55
] . This map give us an in principle one to one relation between the
points in the dual cone, and hence the giant gravitons states, and the
mesonic operators. It is an example of states/operators map in AdS/CFT,
and justifies our discussion about the mesonic BPS operators in chapter
1 .

In this section we construct the same map with generically open paths in
the dimer, and it will reduce to the before mentioned map in the special
case of closed paths. In particular we would like to associate to every
point in the polytope @xmath a sequence of contractions of elementary
fields modulo @xmath -term equivalence. This is indeed possible for a
particular class of polytopes which we now describe. This general map of
course will reduce to the mesonic map in the case of trivial divisors.

Let us start by studying open paths in the dimer. Take two gauge group
@xmath , @xmath in the dimer and draw an oriented path @xmath connecting
them (an oriented path in the dimer is a sequence of chiral fields
oriented in the same way and with the gauge indices contracted along the
path). The global charges of @xmath is the sum of the charges of the
fields contained in @xmath and can be schematically written as:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.5.43)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with some integers @xmath . Draw another oriented path @xmath connecting
the same gauge groups. Consider now the closed non-oriented path @xmath
; as explained in [ 55 ] the charges for a generic non-oriented closed
path can be written as ¹³ ¹³ 13 For non-oriented paths one has to sum
the charges of the fields with the same orientation and subtract the
charges of the fields with the opposite orientation. :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.5.44)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with @xmath a three dimensional integer vector. Hence the charges for a
generic path @xmath connecting two gauge groups are:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.5.45)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Because the path @xmath is oriented we have just added the charges along
it and the coefficients of the @xmath are all positive:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.5.46)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We have the freedom to change @xmath ; this means that the @xmath are
only defined up to the equivalence relation @xmath . Observe that (
3.5.46 ) is the same condition on the exponents for the homogeneous
coordinates @xmath in the global sections @xmath ( 3.2.6 ), and the
equivalence relation @xmath corresponds to the equivalence relation on
the divisors @xmath . Hence we realize that to every path connecting a
pair of gauge groups we can assign a point in a polytope associated with
the divisor @xmath modulo linear equivalence. In particular, all
operators associated with open paths between two gauge groups @xmath
have the same baryonic charge, as it can be independently checked.

Now that we have a concrete map between the paths in the dimer and the
integer points in the polytope we have to show that this map is well
defined. Namely we have to show that we map @xmath -term equivalent
operators to the same point in the polytope and that to a point in the
polytope corresponds only one operator in field theory modulo @xmath
terms relations (the injectivity of the map). The first step is easy to
demonstrate: paths that are @xmath -term equivalents have the same set
of @xmath charges and are mapped to the same point @xmath in the
polytope @xmath . Conversely if paths connecting two gauge groups are
mapped to the same point @xmath it means that they have the same global
charges. The path @xmath is then a closed unoriented path with charge 0.
As shown in [ 54 , 55 ] @xmath and @xmath are then homotopically
equivalent ¹⁴ ¹⁴ 14 Indeed it is possible to show that @xmath and @xmath
of a closed path are its homotopy numbers around the dimer. . Now we can
use the Lemma @xmath in [ 54 ] that says: “in a consistent tiling, paths
with the same @xmath -charge are @xmath -term equivalent if and only if
they are homotopic” to conclude that paths mapped to the same point
@xmath in @xmath are @xmath -term equivalent. Surjectivity of the map is
more difficult to prove, exactly as in the case of closed loops [ 54 ,
55 ] , but it is expected to hold in all relevant cases.

In particular we will apply the previous discussion to the case of
neighbouring gauge groups @xmath connected by one elementary field. If
the charge of the field is @xmath we are dealing with the sections of
the line bundle @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The section @xmath will correspond to the elementary field itself while
all other sections @xmath will correspond to operators with two free
gauge indices @xmath under @xmath and @xmath which correspond to open
paths from @xmath to @xmath . The proposal for finding the gauge
invariant operator dual to the @xmath state @xmath is then the following
¹⁵ ¹⁵ 15 This is just a simple generalization of the one in [ 93 ] . .
We associate to every @xmath , with section @xmath , an operator in
field theory with two free gauge indices in the way we have just
described (from now on we will call these paths the building blocks of
the baryons). Then we construct a gauge invariant operator by
contracting all the @xmath free indices of one gauge group with its
epsilon tensor and all the @xmath free indices of the other gauge group
with its own epsilon. The field theory operator we have just constructed
has clearly the same global charges of the corresponding state in the
string theory side and due to the epsilon contractions is symmetric in
the permutation of the field theory building blocks like the string
theory state. This generalizes Equation ( 3.3.17 ) to the case of a
generic field in a toric quiver. By abuse of language, we can say that
we have considered all the single determinants that we can make with
indices in @xmath .

As already mentioned, D3 branes wrapped on three cycles in @xmath come
with a multiplicity which is given by the non trivial homotopy of the
three cycle. On the field theory side, this corresponds to the fact
there is a multiplicity of elementary fields with the same charge.
Therefore a polytope @xmath is generically associated to various
different pairs of gauge groups @xmath , @xmath . For this reason we say
that the polytope @xmath has a multiplicity @xmath . This implies that
there is an isomorphism between the set of open paths (modulo @xmath
-terms) connecting the different pairs @xmath . Similarly, the single
determinant baryonic operators constructed as above from different pairs
@xmath come isomorphically from the point of view of the counting
problem.

Obviously, the baryonic operators we have constructed are just a subset
of the chiral ring of the toric quiver gauge theory. They correspond to
possible single determinants that we can construct. In the case of
greater baryonic charge (products of determinants) the relation between
points in the polytope @xmath and operators is less manifest and a
preliminary discussion is given in the following section.

For an explicit example of this construction the reader is referred to [
24 ] where the baryonic building blocks associated with a line bundle
over the Calabi-Yau cone @xmath are discussed.

#### 3.5.1 Comments on the General Correspondence

In the case of a generic polytope @xmath , not associated with
elementary fields, the correspondence between sections of the line
bundle @xmath and operators is less manifest. The reason is that we are
dealing with higher baryonic charges and the corresponding gauge
invariant operators are generically products of determinants.

Let us consider as an example the case of the conifold. Suppose we want
to study the polytope @xmath which corresponds to classify the @xmath
operators with baryonic charges equal to @xmath . In field theory we
certainly have baryonic operators with charge @xmath , for example
@xmath . Clearly all the products of two baryonic operators with baryon
number @xmath give a baryonic operator with baryon number @xmath . In a
sense in the conifold all the operators in sectors with baryonic charge
with absolute value bigger than one are factorized [ 94 , 93 ] . However
we cannot find a simple prescription for relating sections of @xmath to
paths in the dimer. Certainly we can not find a single path in the dimer
(Figure 3.4 ) connecting the two gauge groups with charge @xmath .

One could speculate that the prescription valid for basic polytopes has
to be generalized by allowing the use of paths and multipaths. For
example, to the section @xmath in the polytope @xmath for the conifold
we could assign two paths connecting the two gauge groups with charges
@xmath and @xmath with @xmath and therefore a building block consisting
of two operators @xmath , @xmath . We should now construct the related
gauge invariant operators. Out of these building blocks we cannot
construct a single determinant because we don’t have an epsilon symbol
with @xmath indices, but we can easily construct a product operator
using four epsilons. We expect, based on Beasley’s prescription, a one
to one correspondence between the points in the @xmath times symmetric
product of the polytope @xmath and the baryonic operators with baryonic
charge @xmath in field theory. Naively, it would seem that, with the
procedure described above, we have found many more operators. Indeed the
procedure was plagued by two ambiguities: in the construction of the
building blocks, it is possible to find more than a pair of paths
corresponding to the same @xmath (and thus the same @xmath charges) that
are not @xmath -term equivalent; in the construction of the gauge
invariants we have the ambiguity on how to distribute the operators
between the two determinants. The interesting fact is that these
ambiguities seem to disappear when we consider the final results for
gauge invariant operators, due to the @xmath -term relations and the
properties of the epsilon symbol. One can indeed verify, at least in the
case of @xmath and for various values of @xmath , there is exactly a one
to one correspondence between the points in the @xmath times symmetric
product of the polytope and the baryonic operators in field theory. In
the following chapters we would try to make this kind of prescription
more rigorous.

The ambiguity in making a correspondence between sections of the
polytope and operators is expected and it is not particularly
problematic. The correct correspondence is between the states @xmath and
baryonic gauge invariant operators. The sections in the geometry are not
states of the string theory and the paths/operators are not gauge
invariant operators. What the @xmath correspondence tells us is that
there exists a one to one relation between states in string theory and
gauge invariant operators in field theory, and this is a one to one
relation between the points in the @xmath -fold symmetric product of a
given polytope and the full set of gauge invariant operators with given
baryonic charge.

The comparison with field theory should be then done as follows. One
computes the partition functions @xmath of the @xmath -fold symmetrized
product of the polytope @xmath and compares it with all the gauge
invariant operators in the sector of the Hilbert space with given
baryonic charge. We have explicitly done it for the conifold for the
first few values of @xmath and the operators with lower dimension. In
forthcoming chapters we will actually re-sum the partition functions
@xmath and we will write the complete partition function for the chiral
ring of the conifold and other selected examples; we will compare the
result with the dual field theory finding perfect agreement.

The issues of multiplicities that we already found in the case of
polytopes associated with elementary fields persists for generic
polytopes. Its complete understanding is of utmost importance for
writing a full partition function for the chiral ring [ 27 , 28 ] .

### 3.6 Counting BPS Baryonic D3 Branes

In this Section, as promised, we count the number of BPS baryonic
operators corresponding to the BPS D3 branes in the sector of the
Hilbert space @xmath , associated with a divisor @xmath . All operators
in @xmath have fixed baryonic charges. Their number is obviously
infinite, but, as we will show, the number of operators with given
charge @xmath under the torus action is finite. It thus makes sense to
write a partition function @xmath for the BPS baryonic operators
weighted by a @xmath charge @xmath . @xmath will be a polynomial in the
@xmath such that to every monomial @xmath we associate @xmath @xmath D3
brane states with the R-charge and the two flavor charges parametrized
by @xmath .

The computation of the weighted partition function is done in two steps.
We first compute a weighted partition function @xmath , or character,
counting the sections of @xmath ; these correspond to the @xmath which
are the elementary constituents of the baryons. In a second time, we
determine the total partition function @xmath for the states @xmath in
@xmath .

#### 3.6.1 The Character @xmath

We want to re-sum the character, or weighted partition function,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.47)
  -- -------- -- ----------

counting the integer points in the polytope @xmath weighted with their
charge under the @xmath torus action.

In the trivial case @xmath , @xmath is just the partition function for
holomorphic functions discussed in [ 22 , 23 ] , which can be computed
using the Atyah-Singer index theorem [ 22 ] . Here we show how to extend
this method to the computation of @xmath for a generic divisor @xmath .
The results of this section of course reduce to the ones of [ 22 , 23 ]
once we consider the trivial line bundle.

Suppose that we have a smooth variety and a line bundle @xmath with a
holomorphic action of @xmath (with @xmath and @xmath is the toric case).
Suppose also that the higher dimensional cohomology of the line bundle
vanishes, @xmath , for @xmath . The character ( 3.6.47 ) then coincides
with the Leftschetz number

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.48)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which can be computed using the index theorem: we can indeed write
@xmath as a sum of integrals of characteristic classes over the fixed
locus of the @xmath action. In this thesis, we will only consider cases
where @xmath has isolated fixed points @xmath . The general case can be
handled in a similar way. In the case of isolated fixed points, the
general cohomological formula ¹⁶ ¹⁶ 16 Equivariant Riemann-Roch, or the
Lefschetz fixed point formula, reads

@xmath (3.6.49)

where @xmath are the set of points, lines and surfaces which are fixed
by the action of @xmath , @xmath is the Todd class @xmath and, on a
fixed locus, @xmath where @xmath is the weight of the @xmath action. The
normal bundle @xmath of each fixed submanifold @xmath has been splitted
in line bundles; @xmath are the basic characters and @xmath the weights
of the @xmath action on the line bundles. considerably simplifies and
can be computed by linearizing the @xmath action near the fixed points.
The linearized action can be analyzed as follows. Since @xmath is a
fixed point, the group @xmath acts linearly on the normal (=tangent)
space at @xmath , @xmath . The tangent space will split into three one
dimensional representations @xmath of the abelian group @xmath . We
denote the corresponding weights for the @xmath action with @xmath .
Denote also with @xmath the weight of the action of @xmath on the @xmath
fiber of the line bundle @xmath over @xmath . The equivariant
Riemann-Roch formula expresses the Leftschetz number as a sum over the
fixed points

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.50)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We would like to apply the index theorem to our CY cone @xmath .
Unfortunately, @xmath is not smooth and a generic element of @xmath has
a fixed point at the apex of the cone, which is exactly the singular
point. To use Riemann-Roch we need to resolve the cone @xmath to a
smooth variety @xmath and to find a line bundle @xmath on it with the
following two properties: i) it has the same space of sections, @xmath ,
ii) it has vanishing higher cohomology @xmath .

Notice that the previous discussion was general and apply to all
Sasaki-Einstein manifolds @xmath . It gives a possible prescription for
computing @xmath even in the non toric case. In the following we will
consider the case of toric cones where the resolution @xmath and the
divisor @xmath can be explicitly found.

Toric Calabi-Yau cones have a pretty standard resolution by
triangulation of the toric diagram, see Figure 3.5 . In chapter 5 we
will see more involved examples in which the complete resolution of the
singularity imply the introductions of new divisors.

The fan of the original variety @xmath consists of a single maximal
cone, with a set of edges, or one-dimensional cones, @xmath whose
generators @xmath are not linearly independent in @xmath . The
resolutions of @xmath consist of all the possible subdivisions of the
fan in smaller three dimensional cones @xmath . The new variety @xmath
is still a Calabi-Yau if all the minimal generators @xmath of the
one-dimensional cones lie on a plane. This process looks like a
triangulation of the toric diagram. If each three-dimensional cone is
generated by linearly independent primitive vectors, the variety is
smooth. The smooth Calabi-Yau resolutions of @xmath thus consist of all
the triangulation of the toric diagram which cannot be further
subdivided. Each three dimensional cone @xmath is now a copy of @xmath
and the smooth variety @xmath is obtained by gluing all these @xmath
according to the rules of the fan. @xmath acts on each @xmath in a
simple way: the three weights of the @xmath action on a copy of @xmath
are just given by the primitive inward normal vectors @xmath to the
three faces of @xmath . Notice that each @xmath contains exactly one
fixed point of @xmath (the origin in the copy of @xmath ) with weights
given by the vectors @xmath .

The line bundles on @xmath are given by @xmath where the index @xmath
runs on the set of one-dimensional cones @xmath , which is typically
bigger than the original @xmath . Indeed, each integer internal point of
the toric diagram gives rise in the resolution @xmath to a new divisor.
The space of sections of @xmath are still determined by the integral
points of the polytope

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.51)
  -- -------- -- ----------

It is important for our purposes that each maximal cone @xmath
determines a integral point @xmath as the solution of this set of three
equations:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.52)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In a smooth resolution @xmath this equation has always integer solution
since the three generators @xmath of @xmath are a basis for @xmath . As
shown in [ 64 ] , @xmath is the charge of the local equation for the
divisor @xmath in the local patch @xmath and it is equal to zero in the
case of trivial divisor. It is therefore the weight of the @xmath action
on the fiber of @xmath over the fixed point contained in @xmath .

The strategy for computing @xmath is therefore the following. We
smoothly resolve @xmath and find a divisor @xmath by assigning values
@xmath to the new one-dimensional cones in @xmath that satisfies the two
conditions

-   It has the same space of sections, @xmath . Equivalently, the
    polytope @xmath has the same integer points of @xmath .

-   It has vanishing higher cohomology @xmath . As shown in [ 64 ] this
    is the case if there exist integer points @xmath that satisfy the
    convexity condition ¹⁷ ¹⁷ 17 The @xmath s determine a continuous
    piecewise linear function @xmath on the fan as follows: in each
    maximal cone @xmath the function @xmath is given by @xmath , @xmath
    . As shown in [ 64 ] , the higher dimensional cohomology vanishes,
    @xmath , whenever the function @xmath is upper convex.

      -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.6.53)
      -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

    These equations are of course trivially satisfied in the case of
    trivial divisors: namely @xmath and @xmath .

There are many different smooth resolution of @xmath , corresponding to
the possible complete triangulation of the toric diagram. It is possible
to show [ 24 ] that we can always find a compatible resolution @xmath
and a minimal choice of @xmath that satisfy the two given conditions.

The function @xmath is then given as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.54)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where in the toric case for every fixed point @xmath there is a maximal
cone @xmath , @xmath are the three inward primitive normal vectors of
@xmath and @xmath are determined by equation ( 3.6.53 ). This formula
can be conveniently generalized to the case where the fixed points are
not isolated but there are curves or surfaces fixed by the torus action,
and reduce to:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.55)
  -- -------- -- ----------

in the case of trivial divisors.

We finish this Section with two comments. The first is a word of
caution. Note that if we change representative for a divisor in its
equivalence class ( @xmath ) the partition function @xmath is not
invariant, however it is just rescaled by a factor @xmath .

The second comment concerns toric cones. For toric CY cones there is an
alternative way of computing the partition functions @xmath by expanding
the homogeneous coordinate ring of the variety according to the
decomposition ( 3.4.39 ). Since the homogeneous coordinate ring is
freely generated by the @xmath , its generating function is simply given
by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By expanding this function according to the grading given by the @xmath
torus action we can extract all the @xmath . This approach will be
discussed in detail in the following chapters and in section 3.6.3 .

#### 3.6.2 A Simple Example: the Conifold

We now want to use the right now familiar example of the conifold to
give explicit computations and results of the general theory just
explained. The reader is referred to [ 24 ] for a more extensive list of
examples.

The four primitive generators for the one dimensional cones of the
conifold are @xmath and we call the associated divisors @xmath and
@xmath respectively. They satisfy the equivalence relations @xmath .
There is only one baryonic symmetry under which the four homogeneous
coordinates transform as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.56)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath . The conifold case is extremely simple in that the chiral
fields of the dual gauge theory are in one-to-one correspondence with
the homogeneous coordinates: @xmath . Recall that the gauge theory is
@xmath with chiral fields @xmath and @xmath transforming as @xmath and
@xmath and as @xmath and @xmath under the enhanced @xmath global flavor
symmetry.

The two possible resolutions for the conifold are presented in Figure
8.2.3 . We would like first to compute the partition function for the
trivial @xmath divisor. For the trivial line bundle @xmath all @xmath
and @xmath and the localization formula ( 3.6.55 ) is independent of the
particular resolution chosen. In the conifold case there are two
possible complete resolutions ( see Figure 3.5 ). Regions @xmath and
@xmath correspond to the two maximal cones in the resolution and,
therefore, to the two fixed points of the @xmath action. Denote also
@xmath . Using the prescriptions given above, we compute the three
primitive inward normals to each cone.

For the first resolution we have the vectors:

  -- -------- -------- -- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath         
     @xmath   @xmath         (3.6.57)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- ----------

and the generating function is:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.6.58)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

For the second resolution we have the vectors:

  -- -------- -------- -- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath         
     @xmath   @xmath         (3.6.59)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- ----------

and the generating function is:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.6.60)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

And indeed we have @xmath . Hence we conclude that the localization
formula for the conifold for the trivial line bundle @xmath is invariant
under flop transitions. For a complex three dimensional toric variety
@xmath any complete resolutions can be reach from any other by a
sequence of flop transitions. In toric geometry the toric flop
transitions are local operations and are essentially the flop transition
for the conifold that we just discussed. Because we have shown that the
conifold partition function is invariant under flop transitions, we
conclude that the partition function @xmath for any toric three
dimensional variety @xmath is independent of the particular resolution.

We can consider the partition function just along the Reeb vector @xmath
by putting @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.61)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This is exactly the equation 1.5.26 of chapter 1 with @xmath . Hence in
the particular case of trivial line bundle our general procedure
provides a systematic way to reproduce all the results we claimed in
chapter 1 . We can now expand ( 3.6.61 ) in powers of @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.62)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This counting match the mesonic counting of operators in field theory.
Indeed it counts operators in the field theory according to their R
charges in the @xmath symmetric representation of the @xmath global
symmetry group. The expansion ( 3.6.62 ) reproduce the @xmath multitrace
counting:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.63)
  -- -------- -- ----------

or equivalently the @xmath single trace counting:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.64)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We can now pass to compute partition functions for non trivial divisor
@xmath . We first compute the partition function for the divisor @xmath
using the resolution on the left hand side of the figure. Using the
prescriptions given above, we compute the three primitive inward normals
to each cone and the weight of the @xmath action on the fiber. It is
manifest that the conditions required in equation ( 3.6.53 ) are
satisfied.

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.65)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Once again, for simplicity, let us expand @xmath along the direction of
the Reeb vector @xmath by putting @xmath . This corresponds to count
mesonic excitations according to their R-charge, forgetting about the
two @xmath flavor indices.

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.66)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This counting perfectly matches the list of operators in the gauge
theory. In the sector of Hilbert space with baryonic charge @xmath we
find the operators ( 4.5.29 )

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.67)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The F-term equations @xmath , @xmath guarantee that the @xmath indices
are totally symmetric. The generic operator is then of the form @xmath
transforming in the @xmath representation of @xmath thus exactly
matching the @xmath term in @xmath . The R-charge of the operators in
@xmath is accounted by the exponent of @xmath by adding the factor
@xmath which is common to all the operators in this sector (cfr.
equation ( 3.4.34 )). The result perfectly matches with the operators
@xmath since the exact R-charge of @xmath and @xmath is @xmath . We
could easily include the @xmath charges in this counting.

Analogously, we obtain for @xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.68)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Since @xmath the polytope @xmath is obtained by @xmath by a translation
and the the two partition functions @xmath and @xmath are proportional.
Finally, the partition functions for @xmath and @xmath are obtained by
choosing the resolution in the right hand side of figure 8.2.3 , for
which is possible to satisfy the convexity condition ( 3.6.53 )

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.6.69)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

#### 3.6.3 The @xmath Generating Function

Our major objective is to obtain partition functions counting all the
operators in the SCFT according to their set of charges under the
complete global abelian symmetry group. This means that we need to learn
how to sum up the partition functions for fixed baryonic number. We do
not have enough elements yet to give a general recipe, and the reader is
referred to chapter 5 for the general procedure. But it is worthwhile to
give right now the general geometric procedure for the conifold in the
case of @xmath . Indeed we have all the elements we need for this
particular case and we will get a result from a purely geometric
procedure that can be compared with the one obtained from the field
theory point of view in the next chapter, with perfect agreement.

Using the homogeneous coordinates the conifold can be described as the
algebraic quotient of @xmath by the @xmath action as in equation (
3.6.56 ). In this description all the four abelian symmetries of the
gauge theory are manifest as the four isometries of @xmath , which
descend to the R symmetry, the two flavor symmetries and one baryonic
symmetry of the theory on the conifold. In @xmath the symmetries act
directly on the homogeneous coordinates. We will use notations where
@xmath denotes both the homogeneous coordinates and the chemical
potentials for the standard basis of the four @xmath symmetries of
@xmath . Because in the case of the conifold there is just a one-to-one
correspondence between the four homogeneous coordinates @xmath and the
four elementary fields @xmath , looking at the transformation rules of
the fields corresponding to the various homogeneous coordinates we can
set the correspondence:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.70)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the field theory baryonic charge, @xmath the R charge,
and x, y are the weights under the two @xmath global symmetries. Note in
particular that the rescaling symmetry of the @xmath , by which we mod
out to obtain the conifold, can be identified with the baryonic
symmetry.

As we will see in the following chapter the generating function of
homogeneous monomials @xmath on the conifold:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.71)
  -- -------- -- ----------

is just the @xmath generating function @xmath for the SCFT counting the
strings of fields according to their charges. Indeed in the case @xmath
the superpotential of the conifold is trivial and the moduli space is
just @xmath with coordinates the four elementary fields of the conifold,
with the same @xmath charges of the homogeneous coordinates @xmath . We
can indeed assign a degree @xmath to a monomial by looking at the
scaling behavior under the @xmath action in equation ( 3.6.70 ): @xmath
. Let us define the functions @xmath counting the subset of monomials of
degree @xmath . Homogeneous polynomials are not functions on the
conifold in a strict sense, as they transform non trivially under a
rescaling of the @xmath , but are rather sections of a line bundle. Line
bundles on the conifold are labeled by an integer B. For simplicity, we
denote them as @xmath . The holomorphic sections of @xmath are just the
polynomials of degree @xmath . The construction exactly parallels the
familiar case of @xmath where the homogeneous polynomials of degree
@xmath are the sections of the line bundle @xmath .

It is a general result of toric geometry that the homogeneous coordinate
ring of a toric variety decomposes as a sum over non-trivial line
bundles [ 75 ] , which is equivalent to the statement that polynomials
can be graded by their degree. In the case of the conifold we have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.72)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The equation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.73)
  -- -------- -- ----------

translates the previous mathematical identity at the level of generating
functions. In this context @xmath is interpreted as a character under
the action of the three abelian isometries of the conifold with chemical
potential @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.74)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and it is the kind of partition functions we learnt to compute in this
chapter. Indeed for generic @xmath we can expresses the result as a sum
over the fixed points @xmath of the torus @xmath action in a smooth
resolution of the conifold

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.75)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the index @xmath denotes the set of isolated fixed points and the
four vectors @xmath , @xmath in @xmath are the weights of the linearized
action of @xmath on @xmath and the fiber of the line bundle,
respectively.

We notice that to perform a computation using the index theorem we need
to choose a correctly normalized basis @xmath for the @xmath torus
action on the manifold, the same used in the previous section for the
elementary line bundle @xmath , @xmath , @xmath . This implies taking
square roots of the variables @xmath (that have been chosen for
notational simplicity). The relation between variables is easy computed
by using

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.76)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath are the basis vectors of @xmath and @xmath the vertices of
the toric diagram (notice that all dependence on baryonic charges drops
from the right hand side by equation ( 3.3.22 )). We thus have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.6.77)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

For computing the character @xmath of holomorphic functions on the
conifold we use formula ( 3.6.75 ) with @xmath [ 22 ] ; both resolutions
can be used and give the same result. For computing the character @xmath
for sections of a line bundle of degree @xmath we need to choose a
convenient resolution and compute the vectors @xmath and @xmath . This
can be done as already explained in the previous sections. The prefactor
@xmath in formula ( 3.6.75 ) is just given by the @xmath charge of the
monomial @xmath to correctly sum up all the generating functions for
fixed @xmath .

In the case at hand, the partition functions @xmath can be computed
using the divisor @xmath and the resolution on the left in Figure ( 3.6
) for @xmath and the divisor @xmath and the resolution on the right for
@xmath . It is interesting to note that in passing from positive to
negative baryonic charges we need to perform a flop on the resolved
conifold. The weights are reported in Figure 3.6 . Formula ( 3.6.75 )
gives

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

This formula, when expressed in terms of @xmath , using Equation (
3.6.70 ), becomes

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

In the next chapter we will see how it is possible to extract the
complete generating function for @xmath directly from the field theory.
There we will learn that the most efficient way of computing the @xmath
, once you know @xmath , is to expand the generating function of the
coordinate ring @xmath in a generalized Laurent series. Indeed we will
see that the formulae ( 3.6.3 ), computed here just using the geometric
properties of @xmath , can be equivalently obtained from a completely
field theory computation. Indeed this is just a particular example of a
general fact: there exist two different geometric ways of computing the
characters @xmath for general CY manifold @xmath : by Laurent expansion
of the generating function for homogeneous coordinates or by using the
index theorem.

#### 3.6.4 The Partition Function for BPS Baryonic Operators

Let us now pass to shortly analyze the non abelian generic @xmath case.
The BPS baryonic states in a sector of the Hilbert space associated with
the divisor @xmath are obtained from the @xmath by considering the
N-fold symmetrized combinations @xmath . The partition function @xmath
for BPS baryon is obtained from @xmath by solving a combinatorial
problem [ 86 , 23 ] .

Given @xmath as sum of integer points in the polytope @xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.79)
  -- -------- -- ----------

the generating function @xmath for symmetrized products of elements in
@xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.80)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This formula is easy to understand: if we expand @xmath in geometric
series, the coefficient of the term @xmath is given by all possible
products of @xmath elements in @xmath , and this is clearly a @xmath
-symmetric product.

It is easy to derive the following relation between @xmath and @xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.81)
  -- -------- -- ----------

@xmath is exactly the Plethystic function @xmath applied to the function
@xmath . Indeed we have already introduced this function in chapter 1
and we remind the reader that @xmath . We will use the properties of
this function in the following chapters. Here we see as the @xmath
function naturally appears even in the counting problem of baryonic
operators. It will reveal a fundamental tool for studying the counting
problem for the complete chiral ring.

In the case we have computed @xmath in terms of the fixed point data of
a compatible resolution as in equation ( 3.6.54 )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

formula ( 3.6.81 ) allows, with few algebraic manipulation, to write the
generating function as follows

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.82)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We are eventually interested in the case of BPS baryonic operators
associated with the symmetrized elements @xmath , and thus to the @xmath
-fold symmetric partition function:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.6.83)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Thanks to @xmath (see eq. ( 3.6.81 )) we can easily write @xmath in
function of @xmath . For example we have:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Once we know @xmath for a particular baryonic sector of the @xmath
Hilbert space it is easy to write down the complete partition function
@xmath .

### 3.7 Volumes and Field Theory Charges

One of the predictions of the AdS/CFT correspondence for the background
@xmath is that the volume of @xmath is related to the central charge
@xmath of the CFT, and the volumes of the three cycles wrapped by the
D3-branes are related to the R-charges of the corresponding baryonic
operators [ 84 , 90 ] :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.7.84)
  -- -------- -- ----------

To many purposes, it is useful to consider the volumes as functions of
the Reeb Vector @xmath . Recall that each Kähler metric on the cone, or
equivalently a Sasakian structure on the base @xmath , determines a Reeb
vector @xmath and that the knowledge of @xmath is sufficient to compute
all volumes in @xmath [ 18 ] . Denote with @xmath the volume of the base
of a Kähler cone with Reeb vector @xmath . The Calabi-Yau condition
@xmath requires @xmath [ 18 ] . As shown in [ 18 , 22 ] , the Reeb
vector @xmath associated with the Calabi-Yau metric can be obtained by
minimizing the function @xmath with respect to @xmath . This volume
minimization is the geometrical counterpart of a-maximization in field
theory [ 53 ] ; the equivalence of a-maximization and volume
minimization has been explicitly proven for all toric cones in [ 35 , 19
] and for a class a non toric cones in [ 50 ] . For each Reeb vector
@xmath we can also define the volume of the three cycle obtained by
restricting a divisor @xmath to the base, @xmath . We can related the
value @xmath at the minimum to the exact R-charge of the lowest
dimension baryonic operator associated with the divisor @xmath [ 84 , 90
] as in formula ( 3.4.38 ).

All the geometrical informations about volumes can be extracted from the
partition functions. The relation between the character @xmath for
holomorphic functions on @xmath and the volume of @xmath was suggested
in [ 96 ] and proved for all Kähler cones in [ 22 ] . If we define
@xmath , we have [ 96 , 22 ]

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.7.85)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This formula can be interpreted as follows: the partition function
@xmath has a pole for @xmath , and the order of the pole - three -
reflects the complex dimension of @xmath while the coefficient is
related to the volume of @xmath . We can write a general formula for the
volume of @xmath in term of the fixed point data:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.7.86)
  -- -------- -- ----------

For the conifold example we have:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.7.87)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and this correctly reproduce the result of [ 18 ] for the volume.

In a similar way the partition functions @xmath contain the information
about the three-cycle volumes @xmath . Indeed we suggest that, for small
@xmath ¹⁸ ¹⁸ 18 And a convenient choice of @xmath in its equivalence
class. ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.7.88)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Notice that the leading behavior for all partition functions @xmath is
the same and proportional to the volume of @xmath ; for @xmath the main
contribution comes from states with arbitrarily large dimension and it
seems that states factorized in a minimal determinant times gravitons
dominate the partition function. The proportionality to @xmath is then
expected by the analogy with giant gravitons probing the volume of
@xmath . The subleading term of order @xmath in @xmath then contains
information about the dimension two complex divisors. Physically it is
easy to understand that @xmath contains the information about the
volumes of the divisors. We can think at @xmath as a semiclassical
parametrization of the holomorphic non-trivial surfaces in @xmath , with
a particular set of charges related to @xmath ; while @xmath
parametrizes the set of trivial surfaces in @xmath . Thinking in this
way it is clear that both know about the volume of the compact space,
but only @xmath has information on the volumes of the non-trivial three
cycles.

For divisors @xmath associated with elementary fields we can rewrite
equation ( 3.7.88 ) in a simple and suggestive way in terms of the
R-charge, or dimension, of the elementary field (see equation ( 3.4.38
))

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.7.89)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As a check of formula ( 3.7.88 ), we can expand the partition functions
for the conifold computed in the previous Section

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and compare it with the formulae in [ 18 ]

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.7.90)
  -- -------- -- ----------

One can perform similar checks for some @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
singularities, with perfect agreement. A sketch of a general proof for
formula ( 3.7.88 ) is given in [ 24 ] .

We would like to notice that, by expanding equation ( 3.6.54 ) for
@xmath and comparing with formula ( 3.7.88 ), we are able to write a
simple formula for the volumes of divisors in terms of the fixed point
data of a compatible resolution

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.7.91)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This formula can be conveniently generalized to the case where the fixed
points are not isolated but there are curves or surfaces fixed by the
torus action.

The previous formula is not specific to toric varieties. It can be used
whenever we are able to resolve the cone @xmath and to reduce the
computation of @xmath to a sum over isolated fixed points (and it can be
generalized to the case where there are fixed submanifolds). As such, it
applies also to non toric cones. The relation between volumes and
characters may give a way for computing volumes of divisors in the
general non toric case, where explicit formulae like ( 3.7.90 ) are not
known.

In this section we start to appreciate how the geometric informations of
@xmath are encoded in partition functions like @xmath . This is just the
starting point. In the following chapters we will see that a huge
quantity of informations regarding the chiral ring of the gauge theory
is contained in the partition function we are going to compute.

### 3.8 Summary and Discussions

In this chapter we analyzed a general procedure to construct partition
functions counting both baryonic and non baryonic @xmath operators of a
field theory dual to a toric geometry @xmath . These partition functions
contains the structure of the BPS chiral ring of the gauge theory and,
because we computed them counting D3 brane states in the dual gravity
background, in principle they are valid at strong coupling. The
partition functions contain a lot of informations regarding the geometry
of @xmath . Indeed we explained how one can extract the volume of the
horizon manifold H and the volumes of all the elementary three cycles
from the partition functions. These geometrical volumes encode the
values of the central charge and of all the R charges of the gauge
theory at the IR fixed point.

Some observations are mandatory.

As we said our computation is done on the supergravity side, and it is
therefore valid at strong coupling and large N. In the following chapter
we will see that, similarly to the partition function for BPS mesonic
operators [ 86 , 87 , 23 ] , we will be able to extrapolate the result
to finite value for the coupling and for small N. This fact suggest some
non renormalization properties of the spectra, meaning that the number
of BPS operators with a given set of global charges is invariant under
the RG flow.

It would be interesting to understand better the counting of
multiplicity, and to find a way to write down a complete partition
function for the @xmath gauge invariant scalar operators. We will
analyze this issue in the following chapters.

It would be also interesting to understand better the non toric case.
Most of the discussions in this chapter apply to this case as well. The
classical configurations of BPS D3 branes wrapping a divisor @xmath are
still parameterized by the generic section of @xmath and Beasley’s
prescription for constructing the BPS Hilbert space is unchanged. The
partition function @xmath can be still defined, with the only difference
that @xmath with @xmath strictly less than three. @xmath can be still
computed by using the index theorem as explained in Section 3.6 and the
relation between @xmath and the three cycles volumes should be still
valid. In particular, when @xmath has a completely smooth resolution
with only isolated fixed points for the action of @xmath , formulae (
3.6.54 ) and ( 3.7.91 ) should allow to compute the partition functions
and the volumes. What is missing in the non-toric case is an analogous
of the homogeneous coordinates, the polytopes and the existence of a
canonical smooth resolution of the cone. But this seems to be just a
technical problem.

## Chapter 4 Baryonic Generating Functions

In this chapter we will develop some techniques to write down complete
partition functions for quiver gauge theories. We will show how it is
possible to use the plethystic function @xmath , in order to compute
baryonic generating functions that count BPS operators in the chiral
ring of quiver gauge theories living on the world volume of D branes
probing the non compact CY manifold @xmath . These baryonic generating
functions count the mesonic and baryonic chiral spectrum of operators
according to their baryonic charges and for generic number of colours
@xmath . Compare to the previous chapter, we will follow a more field
theory approach, but we will be able to reproduce all the result already
obtained form the more geometric approach just explained, and we will go
far beyond. We will give special attention to the conifold theory, where
exact expressions for generating functions are given in detail, and we
will leave a complete discussion for generic @xmath toric singularity in
the next chapter. In this chapter we do the first step towards the
solution of the long standing problem for the combinatorics of quiver
gauge theories with baryonic moduli spaces. Quite surprisingly, looking
to the conifold example, the baryonic charge turns out to be the
quantized Kähler modulus of the geometry. In the next chapter we will
see that the relation between the baryonic charges and the Kähler moduli
of the geometry @xmath is the key point for solving the multiplicity
problem and construct complete partition functions for all the SCFT dual
to toric singularity @xmath .

### 4.1 Generalities

Enriched by our experience in the previous chapters we understand that
counting problems in supersymmetric gauge theories reveals a rich field
theory and geometrical structure: the generators and the relations in
the chiral ring, as we have already seen in the easy examples of the
@xmath mesonic moduli space for @xmath and the conifold; and the volume
of H and of all its non trivial three cycles, has we have just seen in
the previous sections. Using the generating functions for counting BPS
operators in the chiral ring, one can get further information about the
dimension of the moduli space of vacua and the effective number of
degrees of freedom in the system. The computation of such generating
functions is generically a very hard problem. There are, however,
special cases in which the problem simplifies considerably and one can
get an exact answer for the generating function.

As we have already seen there is an amazing simplification of the
problem of counting BPS operators in the chiral ring when the gauge
theory is living on @xmath D brane in Type II superstring theory [ 23 ,
24 , 63 ] . For such a case one is applying the plethystic program which
is introduced in [ 23 ] and discussed in further d etail in [ 63 ] . The
main point in this program is the use of the plethystic exponential and
its inverse, the plethystic logarithm, in a way which allows the
computation of finite @xmath generating functions in terms of only one
quantity – the generating function for a single D brane. The generating
function for one D brane is calculated in turn by using geometric
properties of the moduli space of vacua for this gauge theory, typically
the moduli space being a CY manifold. In many cases the generating
function for one D brane is computed even without the detailed knowledge
of the quiver gauge theory and bypasses this data by just using the
geometric properties of the moduli space. The PE essentially generate
the functions counting symmetric product of functions counted by the
Hilbert series over which the PE operates. Hence the importance of the
PE is very easy understandable for the mesonic spectra where the moduli
space for N brane is the N times symmetric product of the geometric
singularity @xmath . The importance of the PE function for the counting
of operators with non trivial baryonic number is may be less intuitive;
but it is a fact, coming from the geometric quantization procedure, as
reviewed in the previous chapter, that the PE naturally appears even in
the baryonic counting. We will be more explicit in the following.

The plethystic program brings about an important distinction between
different types of moduli spaces – we have three such types: 1. There
are moduli spaces which are freely generated – that is the set of
generators obey no relations. 2. There are moduli spaces which are
complete intersections – that is there are generators that satisfy
relations such that the number of relations plus the dimension of the
moduli space is equal to the number of generators. 3. The rest are
moduli spaces which are not complete intersections. The last class of
models is by far the largest class. Most moduli spaces of vacua do not
admit a simple algebraic description which truncates at some level. It
is important, however, to single out and specify the moduli spaces which
fall into the first two classes as they are substantially simpler to
describe and to analyze. In this chapter we will analyze the moduli
space of the conifold for different values of @xmath and we will see how
the PE function and its inverse function are very useful for studying
these kind of properties.

Counting problems in supersymmetric gauge theories have been a subject
of recent and not so recent interest. The first paper possibly dates
back to 1998, [ 76 ] and is independently reproduced in [ 85 ] . Other
works include [ 86 , 87 , 88 , 89 , 97 ] , this subject is of increased
interest in recent times. Mesonic generating functions were given in [
23 ] , mixed branches were covered using “surgery” methods [ 25 ] . In
all these works miss a general and powerful enough procedure for
counting the complete spectrum including the operators charged under the
various baryonic symmetries, that are by far the most generic operators.
In the previous chapter we explain how to construct baryonic generating
functions for divisors in toric geometry. This procedure is at the basis
of other counting procedure and reduce to them in particular limits. The
combination of these problems brings about the next interesting problem
– that of counting baryonic operators on the moduli space.

In this chapter we compute generating functions for baryonic BPS
operators. The crucial methods which are used are the successful
combination of the plethystic program [ 23 , 63 ] , introduced in the
chapter 1 , together with the baryonic generating functions for divisors
in the geometry [ 24 ] , explained in the previous chapter. Together
they form an exact result that computes BPS operators on baryonic
branches.

The chapter is organized as follows. In Section 4.2 we introduce the
plethystic program for baryonic generating functions for theories with
one baryonic charge. In Section 4.3 we look in detail on baryonic
generating functions for the conifold theory for @xmath branes. We
discuss in detail the generating function for unfixed and for fixed
baryonic charges. The relation to the geometry is elaborated and
diagrammatic rules are composed for computing generating functions for
@xmath D brane and fixed baryonic charge. The relation to tilings of the
two dimensional plane is discussed and the lattice of BPS charges
reveals itself beautifully as the (p,q) web of the toric diagram. In
section 4.4 we then proceed to discuss the general @xmath case and write
the relations between the different generating functions, f or fixed and
unfixed D brane charge and for fixed and unfixed baryonic charges. The
case of @xmath and small number of branes is computed and discussed in
detail. Aspects of the plethystic exponential and the plethystic
logarithm are then discussed in detail in section 4.5 and in section 4.6
and lead to the understanding of the generators and relations for the
chiral ring of the conifolds for different values of @xmath in 4.6 . In
section 4.7 we turn to some toy models, termed “half the conifold” and
the “ @xmath the conifold”. For the first example we demonstrate how the
plethystic program for baryons computes the generating function exactly,
leading to a freely generated moduli space for fixed number of branes,
@xmath . A comparison with the Molien invariant is then pursued. The
other example is discussed in detail and some explicit formulae are
given.

### 4.2 Generating Functions for CY Manifolds with One Baryonic Charge

In this section we will give general prescriptions on the computation of
generating functions for BPS operators in the chiral ring of a
supersymmetric gauge theory that lives on a D brane which probes a
generic non-compact CY manifold @xmath which has a single baryonic
charge. A class of such manifolds includes the @xmath theories [ 36 , 37
, 38 ] , or more generally it includes the @xmath theories [ 39 , 40 ,
16 , 17 ] . A challenge problem is to compute the generating functions
for baryonic operators. This chapter will be devoted to the study of
this problem, with success for a selected set of theories. The problem
of computing generating functions for a general CY manifold is still
very difficult to solve but with the methods of this section we will be
able to reduce the problem of computing the generating function for a
generic number of D branes, @xmath and generic baryonic number @xmath ,
to a much simpler problem. This reduction is done using the plethystic
program [ 23 ] (See further details in [ 63 ] ).

Recall that, as explained in chapter 1 and derived in the previous
chapter, in the case of baryon number @xmath , namely for mesonic
generating functions [ 23 ] , the knowledge of the generating function
for @xmath is enough to compute the generating function for any @xmath .
This is essentially due to the fact that the operators for finite @xmath
are symmetric functions of the operators for @xmath and this is
precisely the role which is played by the plethystic exponential – to
take a generating function for a set of operators and count all possible
symmetric functions of it.

For the present case, in which the baryon number is non-zero, it turns
out that the procedure is not too different than the mesonic case.
Indeed as shown for some particular cases in the previous chapter, one
needs to have the knowledge of a single generating function, @xmath ,
for one D brane, @xmath and for a fixed baryon number @xmath , and this
information is enough to generate all generating functions for any
number of D branes and for a fixed baryonic number [ 24 ] .

Given a @xmath supersymmetric gauge theory with a collection of @xmath
global symmetries, @xmath , we will have a set of @xmath chemical
potentials @xmath . The generating function for a gauge theory living on
a D brane probing a generic non-compact CY manifold is going to depend
on the set of parameters, @xmath . There is always at least one such
@xmath global symmetry and one such chemical potential @xmath ,
corresponding to the @xmath symmetry, and in the case in which @xmath is
a toric variety @xmath , where @xmath is the number of gauge factors and
we are including the anomalous @xmath symmetries. For a given CY
manifold @xmath we will denote the generating function for a fixed
number of D branes, @xmath and a fixed baryonic charge @xmath by @xmath

Let us introduce a chemical potential @xmath for the number of D branes.
Then the generating function for any number of D branes and for a fixed
baryonic charge @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath                     (4.2.1)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

This formula can be inverted to give the generating function for fixed
baryonic charge and fixed number of branes, in case the generating
function for fixed baryonic charge is known,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We can further introduce a chemical potential @xmath for the baryon
number and sum over all possible baryon numbers go get the generating
function for an unfixed baryonic number,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This formula is very schematic, however sufficient to the purposes of
this chapter. The correct general formula would accommodate multiple
baryonic charges, not necessarily running over all integers, and
multiplicities for the components @xmath . From the previous formula we
can extract the generating function for a fixed number of D branes
@xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This set of equations form the basis of this chapter and allow for the
computation of @xmath for any @xmath and @xmath , once @xmath is known.
As a result, the problem of computing generating functions for baryonic
operators greatly simplifies and amounts to figuring out the much
simpler case of one D brane, @xmath .

From the previous chapter we learnt that the generating function @xmath
can be given a geometric interpretation. @xmath is the character for
holomorphic functions on the CY manifold [ 22 ] , @xmath , for generic
@xmath , is the character for holomorphic sections of suitable line
bundles [ 24 ] . Indeed formula ( 4.2.1 ) can be alternatively
interpreted as giving the BPS Hilbert space of states with baryonic
charge @xmath and number of branes @xmath as the geometric quantization
of the classical configuration space of supersymmetric D3 branes wrapped
on cycles of homology @xmath , as already explained in the previous
chapter.

To demonstrate this method of computation we will now turn to few simple
examples in which one can compute the generating functions and perform
some consistency checks of this proposal.

### 4.3 Baryonic Generating Functions for the Conifold @xmath

In this chapter the conifold will be our main example. Let us start
analyzing how we can encode the global symmetries of the conifold theory
in a generating function. The gauge theory on the conifold has a global
symmetry @xmath . It has 4 basic fields @xmath and @xmath that transform
under these symmetries according to the following table:

The last column represents the corresponding monomial in the generating
function for BPS operators in the chiral ring. @xmath is the chemical
potential for the number of @xmath fields, @xmath is the chemical
potential for the number of @xmath fields, @xmath is the chemical
potential for the Cartan generator of @xmath and @xmath is the chemical
potential for the Cartan generator of @xmath . A generic operator that
carries a spin @xmath with weight @xmath under @xmath , spin @xmath with
weight @xmath under @xmath has @xmath @xmath ’s, @xmath @xmath ’s and
therefore will be represented by the monomial

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We can also keep track of the R-charge and the baryonic charge @xmath by
introducing chemical potentials @xmath and @xmath , respectively. With
this notation we have @xmath and @xmath , and a generic operator
represented by the monomial ( 4.3.1 ) is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and carries @xmath and @xmath . With this notation we can proceed and
write generating functions which count BPS operators in the chiral ring
of the conifold theory.

Since the superpotential for the @xmath theory is @xmath , it is natural
to expect that the generating function is freely generated by the 4
basic fields of the conifold gauge theory and it takes the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This generating function has a simple interpretation in the dimer
representation [ 9 ] for the conifold (see Figure 4.1 ). Recall that the
tiling for the conifold gets the form of a chessboard array [ 10 ] with
two tiles in the fundamental domain and with horizontal arrows @xmath
going right and left respectively, and vertical arrows @xmath going up
and down respectively. A generic BPS operator in the chiral ring for
@xmath will be represented by an open path or possibly by many open
paths in the tiling and the function ( 4.3.3 ) represents all such open
paths.

The dimension of the moduli space for the @xmath theory is 4, as can be
seen from the behavior near @xmath , where one finds the generating
function for @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.3.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This is natural to expect, as this theory has 4 fundamental fields, a
global symmetry of rank 4, and a vanishing superpotential, leading to a
freely generated chiral ring. We will see other examples in which these
conditions are not met and, as a result, the behavior is different.

It is useful to rewrite equation ( 4.3.3 ) in terms of the baryonic and
R-charge chemical potentials.

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.3.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and to expand @xmath in a “generalized” Laurent expansion

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.3.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the generating function for BPS operators at fixed
number of branes with @xmath and fixed baryonic charge @xmath . The
expression ( 4.3.5 ) is exactly the generating function ( 3.6.71 ) we
wrote in the previous chapter, using the homogeneous coordinates of the
conifold. @xmath can be computed using the inversion formula

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.3.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with a careful evaluation of the contour integral for positive and
negative values of the baryonic charge @xmath . We have denoted for
simplicity the integrand to be @xmath . For @xmath the contribution of
the contour integral comes from the positive powers of the poles for
@xmath and we end up evaluating the two residues

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For @xmath the contribution of the contour integral comes from the
negative powers of the poles for @xmath and we end up evaluating the two
residues

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.3.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Collecting these expressions together we get the generating functions
for fixed baryonic number

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Observe that these are exactly the formulae ( 3.6.3 ) we already
obtained in section 3.6.3 just applying the index theorems to the
generic line bundle associated to the baryonic charge @xmath .

Each of these equations reflects the Weyl symmetry of each @xmath global
symmetry, acting as @xmath , @xmath , respectively. Furthermore, under
the map of @xmath and @xmath these equations are invariant, reflecting
the fact that the two @xmath global symmetries are exchanged when the
baryon number reverses sign.

The equations for @xmath take the general form of equation ( 3.6.54 ) in
the previous chapter. It is therefore suggestive that the formulas for
@xmath will always be of this form and will come from localization,
giving rise to contributions from the vertices of the @xmath web which
are the fixed points of the torus action. Figure 4.2 shows the
contribution of each leg and each vertex in the @xmath web of the
conifold theory. The left (right) vertex gives rise to the first
(second) contribution for @xmath , respectively, while the bottom (top)
vertex gives rise to the first (second) contribution for @xmath ,
respectively.

We can ignore the @xmath quantum numbers in Equations ( LABEL:resconF )
by setting @xmath and get

  -- -------- -- ----------

which indeed for the mesonic generating function, @xmath , coincides
with Equation ( 1.5.26 ):

when @xmath , and generalizes it to any baryonic number.

#### 4.3.1 Relation to Dimers and Integer Lattices

It is instructive to draw the lattice of charges that the generating
functions for fixed baryon numbers represent. Taking a power expansion
of the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.3.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

we find that the coefficients @xmath are either @xmath or @xmath . As
such they form some kind of a fermionic condition on an occupation of
the lattice point given by the three integer coordinates @xmath (recall
that @xmath admit half integral values and therefore twice their value
is an integer). This phenomenon of fermionic exclusion was already
observed for mesonic BPS gauge invariant operators in [ 23 ] and
persists for the case of baryonic BPS operators [ 24 ] . It is expected
to persist for any singular toric non-compact CY manifold @xmath . In
contrast, for the non-toric case, although there exist a lattice
structure related to the generating function, the fermionic conditions
seems to be lost [ 50 ] .

Furthermore this lattice of points forms an “integral conical pyramid”
which is given by the intersection of two objects: A) a conical pyramid
with a rectangular base, and B) the three dimensional integral lattice.
Let us see this in some detail for several cases. Let us set @xmath .
With this definition the power of @xmath gives the @xmath charge of the
corresponding operator. We first look at @xmath and expand equation (
LABEL:resconF ) up to order @xmath . We then write down a matrix which
represents the two dimensional lattice in the @xmath coordinates.

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.3.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The point in the middle contains @xmath and represents the identity
operator. The 4 points around it contain a single power of @xmath and
represent the 4 operators, @xmath , corresponding to the spin @xmath
representation of @xmath . These points form an integral square of size
1. Next there are 9 points with @xmath that form a bigger integral
square of size 2. These 9 points represent operators of the form @xmath
where we omit the indices but due to F term constraints we have 9
instead of 16 and transform now in the spin @xmath representation. Next
16 points in @xmath represent the operators @xmath forming an integral
square of size 3, etc. The generic case of @xmath will have @xmath
points, representing the operators @xmath which transform in the spin
@xmath representation, forming an integral square of size @xmath . In
fact this lattice is the weight lattice of the @xmath irreducible
representations of equal spin. We thus see that the lattice points are
in correspondence with chiral operators in the @xmath theory and form a
three dimensional lattice in the @xmath plane. Note that there are 4
diagonal lines which form the boundaries of this three dimensional
lattice. These diagonals coincide with the @xmath web of the conifold
theory, at the point where the size of the two cycle shrinks to zero, as
in the middle of Figure 4.3 . We will soon identify the size of the
two-cycle with the baryon number, or more precisely its absolute value.
It is curious to note that this size is quantized, consistent with
observations in [ 98 , 99 ] .

Let us turn to the case of baryonic charge @xmath . We expand equation (
LABEL:resconF ) to order @xmath and write the matrix for the two
dimensional lattice in @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.3.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Note the factor of @xmath in front of this expression, indicating that
there is one more @xmath field, carrying an @xmath charge @xmath . For
this case there are two lowest order lattice points with @xmath ,
corresponding to the operators @xmath . These two points transform in
the spin @xmath representation and form an integral rectangle of sizes
@xmath . At order @xmath we find 6 lattice points transforming in the
spin @xmath representation and forming an integral rectangle of sizes
@xmath , etc. At order @xmath we find @xmath lattice points transforming
in the spin @xmath and forming an integral rectangle of sizes @xmath .
In summary the lattice we get is the weight lattice of all @xmath
representations with a difference of spin @xmath . The 4 diagonal lines
which form the boundaries of this three dimensional lattice now coincide
with the @xmath web of the conifold theory, at a point where the size of
the two cycle is non-zero, as in the right of Figure 4.3 .

As a last example let us turn to the case of baryonic charge @xmath . We
expand equation ( LABEL:resconF ) to order @xmath and write the matrix
for the two dimensional lattice in @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.3.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In this case there are two more @xmath fields than @xmath fields and
hence there are three lowest order lattice points with @xmath ,
corresponding to the operators @xmath . These three points transform in
the spin @xmath representation and form an integral rectangle of sizes
@xmath . At order @xmath we find 8 lattice points transforming in the
spin @xmath representation and forming an integral rectangle of sizes
@xmath , etc. At order @xmath we find @xmath lattice points transforming
in the spin @xmath and forming an integral rectangle of sizes @xmath .
In summary the lattice we get is the weight lattice of all @xmath
representations with a negative difference of spin @xmath . The 4
diagonal lines which form the boundaries of this three dimensional
lattice now coincide with the @xmath web of the conifold theory after a
flop transition, at a point where the size of the two cy! cle is
non-zero, as in the left of Figure 4.3 .

We summarize this discussion by the observation that the boundaries of
the conical pyramid are identified with the @xmath web of the conifold.
This @xmath web can be resolved in two phases, separated by a flop
transition. Each of these phases is characterized by the sign of the
baryonic charge @xmath and the flop transition appears at @xmath . In
this sense one can identify the baryonic charge with the Kähler modulus
for the conifold.

The relation to dimers then becomes natural. Let us fix a baryonic
charge @xmath . Take the tiling of the conifold, fix a reference tile
and consider all open paths that begin with this tile, consists of
@xmath arrows of type @xmath (horizontal) and @xmath arrows of type
@xmath (vertical) such that the numbers @xmath and @xmath satisfy the
condition @xmath . For a given endpoint there may be more than one path
which connects it to the reference tile. All such paths are equal by
imposing the F-term conditions. See [ 54 ] for a detailed explanation
and [ 55 , 24 ] for the applications to the mesonic and baryonic BPS
operators. The collection of endpoints then forms the two dimensional
projection of the three dimensional “conical pyramid” lattice discussed
above. What we have just seen in this section can be seen as the dimer
realization of the geometric localization techniques used in the
previous chapter.

### 4.4 General Number of Branes, @xmath, for the Conifold

In the previous section we saw the generating function for the case of
@xmath for the conifold. In this section we will develop the general
@xmath case. This is done using the Plethystic Exponential. Recall that
in the case of baryon number @xmath , namely for mesonic generating
functions, [ 23 ] the knowledge of the generating function for @xmath is
enough to compute the generating function for any @xmath . This is
essentially due to the fact that the operators for finite @xmath are
symmetric functions of the operators for @xmath and this is precisely
the role which is played by the plethystic exponential – to take a
generating function for a set of operators and count all possible
symmetric functions of it.

For the present case, in which the baryon number is non-zero, it turns
out that the procedure is not too different than the mesonic case. One
needs to have the knowledge of a single generating function, @xmath ,
for one D brane, @xmath and for a fixed baryon number @xmath , and this
information is enough to compute all generating functions for any number
of D branes and for a fixed baryonic number [ 24 ] (see section 3.6.4 ).
Indeed the field theory operators with fixed baryonic numbers, when the
rank of the gauge group factor is N, are obtained contracting N strings
of elementary fields of the @xmath case with two epsilons, and hence
they are symmetric in the @xmath operators.

We can summarize this information by writing an expression for the
generating function of any number of branes and any baryonic number,

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where the first equality indicates that this is a generating function
for fixed number of branes, the second equality indicates that we are
summing over all contributions of fixed baryonic numbers and that each
contribution is the plethystic exponential of the generating function
for one D brane and for fixed baryonic charge. The third equality
expresses the generating function in terms of a multi-contour integral
of the generating function for one D brane. For completeness, using
Equation ( 4.3.5 ) and Equation ( LABEL:resconF ) we write down the
generating function as explicit as possible,

  -- -- -------- -------- --
                 @xmath   
        @xmath   @xmath   
        @xmath   @xmath   
        @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -- -------- -------- --

If we further ignore the @xmath quantum numbers and set @xmath we get

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The exponential terms have an equivalent representation as infinite
products and take the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

#### 4.4.1 @xmath for the Conifold

Taking the expansion of Equation ( 4.4 ) to second order in the chemical
potential @xmath for the number of D branes, we find

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath            
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

and we divided the contribution into two terms, @xmath and @xmath . We
next use the identity

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.4.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and evaluate @xmath to be

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.4.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

@xmath is slightly more involved since it contains two contour integrals
but still is relatively easy to evaluate,

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
                                
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

We can now collect all the terms and get an expression for @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.4.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We can recall the chemical potentials for counting the @xmath and @xmath
fields and rewrite

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.4.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Let us evaluate the second term and write it explicitly using equation (
4.3.3 ).

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.4.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The residue integral now gets contributions from 4 different points at

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.4.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The computations are a bit lengthy but after some work we get an
expression for the generating function for BPS operators on N=2 D branes
probing the conifold. If we ignore the @xmath weights by setting @xmath
, we obtain:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.4.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Similar expressions can be obtained for @xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.4.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.4.28)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

and greater values of @xmath .

The properties of these generating functions for different values of
@xmath are discussed in Section 4.6 .

### 4.5 The PE, the Baryonic Chiral Ring and the Geometric Quantization

It should be clear from the previous sections that the knowledge of the
generating function @xmath for @xmath and fixed baryonic number @xmath
is enough to compute the generating function for any @xmath and @xmath .
Intuitively this is essentially due to the fact that the chiral BPS
operators for finite @xmath are symmetric functions of the operators for
@xmath . The plethystic exponential has the role of taking a generating
function for a set of operators and of counting all possible symmetric
functions of them, therefore it allows to pass from @xmath to @xmath .
In this section we want to explain in detail how this procedure works
for the simple case of the conifold for baryonic charge @xmath , and the
geometric realization of this procedure.

In section 3.3.1 we have seen that the generic baryonic operators with
baryonic charge N is obtained taking N strings of the elementary fields
@xmath , each one having baryonic charge one:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.5.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and contract them with two epsilon symbols:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.5.30)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Thanks to the @xmath symbols these operators are completely symmetric in
the exchange of the @xmath ’s. Now we want to understand the role of the
plethystic exponential in the problem of counting all the operators of
the form ( 4.5.30 ). It is clear that the generating function counting
all the possible BPS operators with baryonic charge N is the one that
counts all the possible symmetric products of N elements of the form (
4.5.29 ). The BPS operators ( 4.5.29 ) are in correspondence with points
inside an integral conical pyramid (see Section 4.3.1 ), that we denote
@xmath . Therefore counting the operators ( 4.5.29 ) is the same as
counting the integer points @xmath inside @xmath , and the counting
procedure for generic @xmath is simply achieved by:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.5.31)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where we have introduced the chemical potential @xmath for the number of
branes, and @xmath are the chemical potentials for the @xmath toric
action. ¿From this expansion it is clear that the LHS of Equation (
4.5.31 ) is the generating function for all the possible symmetric
products of @xmath elements inside @xmath . The RHS of Equation ( 4.5.31
) is what we write as @xmath , and it is easy to show that:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.5.32)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The RHS of Equation ( 4.5.32 ) is the definition of the plethystic
exponential, hence we have the relation:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.5.33)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This is the physical justification of the use of the plethystic
exponential in the baryonic counting problem: the generic BPS operator
of the gauge theory in the presence of N D3 branes, Equation ( 4.5.30 ),
is a symmetric function of the chiral operators in the case of @xmath ,
Equation ( 4.5.29 ). Hence once we know @xmath we obtain @xmath by
counting all possible symmetric functions of the operators in @xmath ,
and this is exactly the role of the plethystic exponential.

It is also possible to relate the plethystic exponential to the result
of the geometric quantization procedure of a system of D3 branes wrapped
on three cycles inside @xmath . It is known that the gauge theory we
have discussed so far is dual to Type IIB string theory on the @xmath
supergravity background. In the geometric side the baryonic operators
correspond to D3 branes wrapped over non trivial three cycles in @xmath
. The supersymmetric D3 brane wrapping three-cycles in @xmath are in one
to one correspondence with the holomorphic surfaces @xmath in the real
cone @xmath over @xmath [ 92 , 93 ] . As explained in section 3.6.3 , we
can associate to every vertex of the toric diagram a global homogeneous
coordinate @xmath . In the conifold case the homogeneous coordinates
@xmath with charges @xmath can be put in one-to-one correspondence with
the elementary fields @xmath which have indeed the same charges. Hence
all the supersymmetric configurations of D3 branes wrapped in @xmath
with @xmath are zero loci of homogeneous polynomials of degree one:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.5.34)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

where @xmath ’s are complex numbers and parametrize the supersymmetric
D3 brane embeddings. This is a particular case of the general procedure
explained in the previous chapter, and we know that the phase space
@xmath of this classical system of D3 branes is @xmath and the @xmath ’s
are its homogeneous coordinate [ 93 ] ; and the BPS Hilbert space,
obtained using geometric quantization procedures [ 95 , 93 ] over @xmath
, is spanned by the degree @xmath polynomials in the homogeneous
coordinates @xmath , where @xmath is the value of the integral of the
five form @xmath over @xmath , and it correspond to the number of colors
in the dual gauge theory. These polynomials are clearly completely
symmetric in the exchange of the @xmath ’s and one can write them as the
symmetric states:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.5.35)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In this geometric language every @xmath correspond to a section of the
line bundle @xmath and the problem of counting all these sections is
explained in detail in section 3.6 . Let us denote the generating
function for this counting problem @xmath , meaning that we are counting
the sections of the line bundle @xmath over the conifold: we use the
notation explained in the previous chapter. The geometric quantization
procedure prescribes that ( 4.5.35 ) are a basis of the Hilbert space
for the BPS wrapped D3 branes, and hence of all the possible symmetric
products of @xmath of the sections of @xmath . As explained above, it is
by now clear that the role of the plethystic exponential is to pass from
the generating function of the global sections of @xmath to the
generating function of their @xmath -times symmetric products:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.5.36)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Hence in the geometric picture the appearance of the plethystic
exponential is the realization of the geometric quantization procedure
over the phase space of a system of wrapped D3 branes in the internal
geometry.

Clearly, there exists a precise relation between the two counting
problems [ 93 ] . From the identification of the elementary fields of
the conifold with the homogeneous coordinates @xmath , one has the
obvious association between the homogeneous coordinates @xmath over the
phase space and the chiral operators with @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.5.37)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and hence the correspondence between the BPS states in @xmath and the
baryonic operators in the dual field theory [ 93 ] :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.5.38)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Therefore the interpretation of the plethystic exponential in these
counting problems is two-fold: in the gauge theory side it is the
realization that the generic BPS baryonic operator is a symmetric
product of some basic building blocks; in the geometric side it is the
direct outcome of the geometric quantization procedure of a system of D3
branes. The two approaches are related by the @xmath correspondence ¹ ¹
1 In the generic toric case there exist a relation between the two
counting problem, but it is more subtle, mainly due to the fact that the
correspondence between the homogeneous coordinates @xmath and the
elementary fields of the dual gauge theory is not one to one. :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.5.39)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Now we understand a bit better the correspondence between the geometric
and the field theory counting. The correspondence for general toric
variety @xmath and general line bundle is much more complicated and we
will explain it in the following chapter. But, for notation simplicity,
we will leave from on the symbol @xmath for the generating function and
we will use just the symbol @xmath both for the field theory and the
geometric computations.

### 4.6 The Structure of the Chiral Ring for the Conifold

Now that we have under control the generating functions for the conifold
for generic baryonic number @xmath and number of branes @xmath , it is
interesting to understand the structure of the chiral ring for different
values of @xmath .

For simplicity we consider the generating functions for the conifold
@xmath with @xmath , @xmath . In this way it counts only the number of
fields @xmath ( @xmath ) and @xmath ( @xmath ) in the gauge invariant
operators without taking into account their weights under the global
@xmath symmetries. Our procedure will be to take the plethystic
logarithm (PE @xmath , or equivalently PL) of the generating function
@xmath . This operation is the inverse function of the plethystic
exponential and it was defined in section 1.5.2 :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.40)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the Möbius function We remind the reader that acting
with PE @xmath on a generating function gives back the generating series
for the generators and the relations in the chiral ring. We are going to
see that the result is generically an infinite series in which the first
terms with the plus sign give the basic generators while the first terms
with the minus sign give the relations between these basic generators.
Then there is an infinite series of terms with plus and minus signs due
to the fact that the moduli space of vacua is not a complete
intersection. In the introductory section 1.5.2 we have just seen
examples of PE @xmath that has a finite extension: namely free generated
rings and complete intersections. In this section we will see examples
of the generic infinite extension of the PE @xmath for non complete
intersections.

Let us start with the simplest case @xmath . In this case the generating
function for the conifold is simply:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.41)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Taking the plethystic logarithm we obtain:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.42)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This means that in the case @xmath the chiral ring is freely generated
by @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , @xmath without any relations. Indeed in
this case the gauge theory is Abelian and we have no matrix relations,
the superpotential is zero and we have no @xmath -term relations.

We can now pass to the more interesting case of @xmath . The generating
function is given in Equation ( 4.4.26 ):

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.43)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The first terms of its plethystic logarithm are:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.44)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As explained above the interpretation of equation ( 4.6.44 ) is: the
first three monomials are the basic generators of the chiral ring and we
can recognize them in the following gauge invariant operators in the
quiver theory :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.6.45)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

where the indices contraction between fields and epsilon symbols is
implicit. These operators transform under spin (1,0), (0,1), and @xmath
of @xmath , respectively.

The second three monomials give the quantum number of the relations
between the basic generators of the chiral ring. The presence of these
relations means that the chiral ring in the case @xmath is not freely
generated. It is possible to understand this fact looking at the higher
degree gauge invariant fields in the chiral ring. At order @xmath using
the ten basic generators we can write the operators:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.46)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Using the tensor relation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.47)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and some tensor algebra we can rewrite the gauge invariants in equation
( 4.6.46 ) in terms of the operators:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.48)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Hence it is possible to write the @xmath operators in equation ( 4.6.46
) in terms of the @xmath operators in equation ( 4.6.48 ). This means
that there exist at least @xmath relations with quantum numbers @xmath
between the ten basic generators in Equation ( 4.6 ). One can check that
the relations are exactly three and these are precisely the ones
predicted by the term @xmath in Equation ( 4.6.44 ). To justify the term
@xmath in ( 4.6.44 ) one works in the same way as before exchanging the
@xmath fields with the @xmath fields. In a similar way we can justify
the term @xmath in ( 4.6.44 ). Using the ten basic generators we can
write the following @xmath operators at level @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.49)
  -- -------- -- ----------

these can be written in terms of the @xmath operators:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.50)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the identity operator.

Hence we see that in field theory there exist @xmath relations with the
quantum numbers @xmath , and these are the ones predicted by the
plethystic logarithm in equation ( 4.6.44 ).

The higher monomials in equation ( 4.6.44 ) mean that the moduli space
of the conifold at @xmath is not a complete intersection.

At @xmath one may expect the presence of the mesonic operators @xmath
among the basic generators of the chiral ring, but it is easy to show
that:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.51)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and hence we conclude that @xmath do not appear independently, but are
generated by the ten basic gauge invariant operators in ( 4.6 ) as
predicted by the plethystic logarithm in Equation ( 4.6.44 ).

To check the consistency of the discussion about the basic generators
and their relations one can expand the generating function @xmath at the
first few orders:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

and try to construct the gauge invariant operators associated with each
monomial. It is convenient to form this expansion into a two dimensional
lattice in the @xmath coordinates,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.53)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The @xmath is the identity operator, the quadratic monomials are the
basic generators already discussed, at the quartic order we begin to
have composite operators made out of the 10 generators. Let us count
them taking into account their symmetry properties:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.6.54)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

Thus, the counting as encoded in the generating function and the
explicit counting in the gauge theory nicely agree. It is interesting to
do the same analysis at dimension six, because at this level the
relations among the basic generators enter into the game (see equation (
4.6.44 )):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.6.55)
                                   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

Also at this level the computation with the generating function and with
the conformal field theory techniques, taking into account the relations
between the basic generators previously explained, nicely agree.

It is now interesting to give a look at the case of @xmath . This is the
first level where non factorisable baryons appear [ 94 , 93 ] . These
types of baryons are the ones that cannot be written as a product of
mesonic operators (traces of fields) and the basic baryons (for example
@xmath at the level @xmath is a basic baryon). The generating function
for @xmath has the form:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.56)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is a polynomial in @xmath , @xmath give in equation (
4.4.28 ). The first few terms in the @xmath lattice look like

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.57)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We now take the plethystic logarithm to understand the structure of
basic generators at level @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.58)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with the dots meaning the presence of relations among the basic
generators at higher orders in @xmath , @xmath . On the @xmath lattice
this expression looks like this

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.59)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Now we would like to match the predictions of equation ( 4.6.58 ) with
the gauge invariant operators in quiver theory

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

As at the level @xmath the operators of the type @xmath do not appear
independently but are generated by the basic operators in ( 4.6 ). This
can be understood in the same way as the case @xmath using the tensor
relation ( 4.6.47 ).

The most interesting basic generators are the ones related to the
monomials @xmath , @xmath : these are the first cases of non
factorizable baryons. Let us analyze the monomial @xmath (the discussion
for the other monomial is the same if one exchanges the @xmath fields
with the @xmath fields and @xmath with @xmath ). At this level, if all
the baryonic operators were factorizable, the only gauge invariant
operators we could construct with the right quantum numbers would be of
the type @xmath and there are just @xmath of them. If instead we follow
the general proposal [ 93 , 24 ] to relate monomials in the homogeneous
coordinates to baryonic gauge invariant operators, at the level @xmath
we would write the operators

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.6.61)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the epsilon terms are contracted once with each index in the
brackets. If we count how many operators exist of this form we discover
that they are @xmath . This suggests that among the operators in (
4.6.61 ) there are @xmath that are not factorizable and must be included
as generators of the ring. An explicit computation shows that there are
indeed two non factorizable determinants. These two “special” baryons in
the spectra of the field theory are the ones that make the generating
function @xmath non trivial, and they are precisely the ones required by
the plethystic logarithm ( 4.6.58 ) as basic generators at the level
@xmath . The existence of non factorizable baryons is related to the
flavor indices of the @xmath [ 94 ] ; only those baryons where the
@xmath are suitably symmetrized can be factorized using the relation (
4.6.47 ).

Next, one can go up with the values of @xmath and try to extract the
general pattern of basic generators for the chiral ring of the gauge
theory dual to the conifold singularity.

We use a notation where @xmath denotes the weights of the gauge
invariant operators under @xmath , @xmath . The basic generators for the
first few values of @xmath are:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
                       @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
                       @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.6.62)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

From ( 4.6 ) it seems that the pattern of the basic generators for
generic @xmath is the following (we assume reflection symmetry under the
exchange of @xmath and @xmath ):

-   The mesonic generators of the chiral ring are all the mesons (single
    traces) starting from weight (1,1) up to weight @xmath . There are
    @xmath generators with weight @xmath , transforming in the spin
    @xmath representation, leading to a total of @xmath generators;

-   The baryonic generators of the chiral ring have a jump of 2 in the
    level:

    -   @xmath generators of weight @xmath ;

    -   @xmath generators of weight @xmath starting at level @xmath ,
        which are exactly the non factorizable baryons we have already
        discussed;

    -   generators of weight @xmath starting at level @xmath , which are
        new non factorizable baryons;

    -   etc.

The non factorizable baryons appear for the first time at level @xmath ,
and going up with the number of branes the number and type of non
trivial baryons increase.

### 4.7 Some Toy Models

In this section we are going to look at some toy models to give more
explicit formulae and a more complete comparison with the field theory
BPS spectrum.

#### 4.7.1 Half the Conifold

A nice toy model consists of half the matter content of the conifold.
This model is particularly simple as it has no F term relations and all
baryons are factorized. The gauge theory data can be encoded in the
quiver in Figure 4.4 with @xmath .

The chiral multiplets are assigned charges according to Table 4.2 which
is a reduction of Table 4.1 .

With this toy model we are counting the subset of BPS operators of the
conifold with no occurrences of @xmath and @xmath .

As for the conifold case, the generating function for one D brane and
any baryon number is freely generated by the two chiral multiplets
@xmath and @xmath and takes the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.7.63)
  -- -------- -- ----------

¿From which it is easy to extract the generating function for fixed
baryonic charge @xmath and one D brane, @xmath ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

which indeed reflects the symmetry of taking @xmath , @xmath
simultaneously. Setting @xmath to be the chemical potential for the
number of D branes, @xmath , and taking the @xmath -inserted plethystic
exponential of these expressions we can easily extract the the
generating function for fixed number of baryons

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

We can compare this generating function to the generating function of
the complex line, taken from [ 23 ] ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.7.64)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which upon substitution @xmath and @xmath for positive baryonic charge
and similar expressions for negative baryonic charge, leads to the
generating function for fixed number of D branes @xmath and fixed
baryonic charge @xmath ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Note the relation @xmath (and a similar expression for @xmath ) which
implies that the partition function at baryonic number @xmath is
proportional to the mesonic partition function. This can be understood
by observing that, since there are no flavor indices, using equation (
4.6.47 ), we can factorize all baryons into a product of the basic
baryons @xmath and @xmath times mesons.

Summing over all baryonic charges we can get the generating function for
fixed number of D3-branes, @xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.7.65)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Which turns out to be freely generated. The corresponding chiral ring of
BPS operators is generated by the @xmath operators, @xmath , @xmath ,
and Tr @xmath .

##### Comparing with the Molien Invariant

The generating functions for cases in which the superpotential is zero
can be computed using a different method – that of the Molien Invariant
[ 76 , 85 ] . In the next chapter we will see a generalization of this
techniques to include the case in which the superpotential is non
trivial.

In the zero super potential case the method of the Molien Invariant uses
a multi-contour integral formula and goes as follows. Given a
supersymmetric @xmath gauge theory with a gauge group @xmath of rank
@xmath and Weyl group of order @xmath , and a set of chiral multiplets
transforming in representations, @xmath , we set a chemical potential
@xmath for each representation and compute the generating function for
BPS operators in the chiral ring

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.7.66)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath are weights of the adjoint representation of @xmath , while
@xmath are weights of the representation @xmath .

This function is also used in the Commutative Algebra literature (see
for example [ 100 ] ) and is called there the Molien–Weyl invariant.

For the case of a gauge group @xmath and @xmath chiral multiplets in the
fundamental representation we introduce @xmath chemical potentials,
@xmath and this multi-contour integral can be extended to an @xmath
-dimensional contour integral of the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.7.67)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This expression counts all gauge invariant operators which contain
fields in the fundamental representation but not fields in the
anti-fundamental representation. If we would like to count BPS operators
which are constructed out of @xmath chiral multiplets in the fundamental
representation and @xmath chiral multiplets in the anti-fundamental
representation we introduce chemical potentials @xmath and @xmath and
write the integral

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.7.68)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- ----------

We are now ready to present the formula for the case of discussion in
this section, half the conifold. We have two gauge groups, @xmath for
which we introduce 2 sets of @xmath variables each, @xmath , and @xmath
. There is one chiral multiplet @xmath with a chemical potential @xmath
and one chiral multiplet @xmath with

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.7.69)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- ----------

The case @xmath was computed explicitly and the result coincides with
Equation ( 4.7.65 ), while other cases were not checked due the heavy
computations they involve but definitely can be checked for higher
values of @xmath .

#### 4.7.2 @xmath Conifold

Here we are considering another example of counting BPS operators which
are a subset of the states in the conifold theory. We are going to
restrict to all the operators that include the fields @xmath in Table
4.1 but not @xmath . Since these are 3 out of 4 of the fundamental
fields of the conifold theory we use the suggestive name “ @xmath
Conifold”. It is amusing to see that some of the expressions can be
derived exactly and for any number of branes @xmath and for any baryonic
number @xmath , even though the full answer can be represented
implicitly but no explicit expression is known. The first point to note
is that the field @xmath has no flavor index and therefore all baryons
with negative baryonic charge factorize. This allows us to sum exactly
all the generating functions with negative baryonic charge and fixed
@xmath . The F term relations are indeed relevant for this problem but
they turn out to affect the mesons only ( @xmath ). For simplicity of
computations we are going to set @xmath while the chemical potential
@xmath for the second @xmath is not needed.

The @xmath generating function is again freely generated and is given by
equation ( 4.3.3 ) with the factor corresponding to @xmath removed. It
takes the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.7.70)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Using techniques which by now are standard (see equations ( 4.3.7 , 4.3
, 4.3.8 )) we have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.7.71)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

and applying the plethystic exponential we find the generating function
for fixed @xmath .

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

We notice that, as in the half-conifold case,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.7.72)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This implies an equality satisfied by generating functions with fixed
number of branes and fixed negative baryonic charge by taking the power
expansion in @xmath on both sides,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.7.73)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Next we sum over all negative baryonic charges and get

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.7.74)
  -- -------- -- ----------

so that just one free generator ( @xmath ) is added to the mesonic ones.
In agreement with the fact that baryons are factorized and relations
only apply to mesons.

Notice that the partition function for mesons, @xmath with @xmath is the
mesonic partition function for @xmath , namely

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This follows from the fact that the two matrices @xmath and @xmath are
adjoint valued and commute due to F-term relations. As a result their
moduli space is a copy of @xmath .

The other half of the spectrum with @xmath is more difficult to analyze:
there are non factorizable baryons and non trivial relations. To get
some expressions for the positive case we write

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The baryon number dependence is indeed isolated but does not seem to
simplify to be summed over.

##### @xmath for @xmath the Conifold

Getting a general expression for any @xmath seems to be too hard. We can
nevertheless use the techniques described in Section 4.4.1 in order to
get an explicit expression for @xmath . Using equations ( 4.4.22 ) and (
4.7.70 ), we find

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.7.75)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

implying that the moduli space of vacua for this theory is a complete
intersection and is generated by the 6 operators, the spin 1 baryons,
@xmath , the spin @xmath mesons @xmath , and the spin 0 baryon @xmath .
The moduli space is five dimensional, and is given by a degree (4,2) (4
@xmath ’s, 2 @xmath ’s) relation in these 6 generators.

### 4.8 Summary and Discussions

The results of this chapter were presented in an almost purely field
theory language. Looking at the previous chapter we can review the
success of the present one as the nice marriage of two basic principles
to construct the exact generating function which counts baryonic and
mesonic BPS operators in the chiral ring of quiver gauge theories. We
gave explicit formulas for the conifold theory and some subsets of the
fields in it (these are termed “half the conifold” and “ @xmath the
conifold”, respectively). The first principle relies on the plethystic
program [ 23 , 63 ] that consist of a set techniques to generate
partition functions for generic number of branes once the @xmath case is
known. The second principle [ 24 ] uses some index theorems to handle
baryonic generating functions with specific divisors in the geometry.
This is translated into generating functions for fixed baryonic numbers
and hence leads to the full generating function for any number of D
branes, N, and any baryonic charge, @xmath , as well as the other
charges in the system such as @xmath charges and flavor charges.

It is interesting to remark that the results in this chapter can be also
interpreted as based on the semiclassical quantization of wrapped
supersymmetric branes in an @xmath background dual to a strongly coupled
gauged theory at large @xmath [ 24 ] . We compared this strong coupling
computations with the spectrum of operators obtained directly in field
theory, for some specific values of @xmath and some set of operators.
The match seems one to one at least for the specific case described in
the chapter. This fact induce us to guess that such countings are valid
also for weak coupling constant and small values of @xmath , as
similarly observed in the case of @xmath [ 87 ] . We will see some other
examples of this kind of interpolation between strong coupling large N
and weak coupling small N in the following chapter.

An important outcome, that will be fundamental in the following chapter,
is the identification of the baryon number @xmath with the Kähler
modulus. This identification is very explicit in the conifold theory and
it is expected to be true for any CY manifold @xmath . In the next
chapter we will see in great detail how the Kähler modulus of the
geometry @xmath and the baryonic charges of the gauge theory are
related.

We can make some short speculation: the fact that computation of
generating functions reveals an important connection between gauge
theories and their CY moduli spaces, may suggest that the baryon number
in field theory may be interpreted as the discrete area of two cycles in
@xmath . Pushing on this correspondence we can guess that the discrete
values of the baryonic charges are the quantum volume of the two and
four cycles in a regime in which the string theory is strongly coupled
and the gauge theory description reveals an underlying discrete
structure. We expect this correspondence could produce a new line of
research for strongly coupled string theories, and we will present more
data in favor of this correspondence in the next chapter.

## Chapter 5 Partition Functions for General Quiver Gauge Theories

In the previous two chapters we accumulated enough informations to
attack the problem of counting BPS gauge invariant operators in the
chiral ring of quiver gauge theories living on D-branes probing generic
toric @xmath singularities @xmath . This is in principle an extremely
difficult task. In this chapter we will try to give a synthesis of what
we learnt both from the geometry and the field theory to develope
powerful techniques to solve the general problem.

In the previous chapter, in some short comments, we claimed some kind of
relations between baryonic charges and Kähler structure of @xmath . In
this chapter we will discover that the computation of generating
functions that include counting of baryonic operators is strongly
related to a possibly deep connection between the baryonic charges in
field theory and the Kähler moduli of @xmath .

A study of the interplay between gauge theory and geometry shows that
given geometrical sectors appear more than once in the field theory,
leading to a notion of “multiplicities”. We explain in detail how to
decompose the generating function for one D-brane into different sectors
and how to compute their relevant multiplicities by introducing
geometric and anomalous baryonic charges. The Plethystic Exponential
remains a major tool for passing from one D-brane to arbitrary number
@xmath of D-branes. We will illustrate a general procedure valid for all
the toric CY variety @xmath .

To make the discussion more easy to follow we will revisit the analysis
the conifold and we will study in detail the explicit examples of @xmath
and @xmath .

### 5.1 Generalities

This chapter is devoted to the study of the (baryonic and mesonic)
generating function for the chiral ring in quiver gauge theories.
Extending the results of the previous chapter, we compute the generating
functions including baryonic degrees of freedom for various theories. We
first study in detail the generating function for one D-brane and we
decompose it into sectors with definite baryonic charges. This
decomposition is closely related to the geometry and to the generating
functions for holomorphic curves obtained by localization in the CY
manifold @xmath . We conjecture that the generating function for a
number @xmath of D-branes is completely determined by the generating
function for a single D-brane and it is obtained by applying the
plethystic exponential to each sector [ 23 , 24 , 25 , 63 , 27 ] . This
conjecture, which can be proved in the case of mesonic operators, is
inspired by the geometrical quantization of the classical D3-brane
configurations in the gravitational dual. We explicitly compute the
generating functions for a selected set of singularities, including
@xmath , @xmath and we make various checks in the dual field theory. We
refer the reader to [ 28 ] for other examples.

In chapter 4 we studied the simple and elegant case of the conifold. A
new feature, which arises for more involved singularities, like for
example @xmath and @xmath , is the existence of multiplicities, namely
the fact that geometrical sectors appear more than once in field theory.
As we go over these examples in detail, we find that multiplicities have
a geometrical interpretation and can be resolved, with a construction
that ties together in a fascinating way the algebraic geometry of the CY
and the combinatorics of quiver data.

The chapter is organized as follows. In section 5.2 , we discuss the
basics of generating functions and plethystics. In section 5.3 , we
apply these tools and we explain in detail the nice interplay between
the geometric properties of the singularity @xmath and the graph
properties of the field theory, that conspire to give the general recipe
to obtain the complete generating function for every toric CY
singularities. We give a detailed discussion of the partition functions
from both the field theory and the geometry perspectives. The GKZ
decomposition is introduced and the auxiliary GKZ partition function is
defined. Section 5.4 contains detailed examples: we revise the conifold
and we study in detail the @xmath and the @xmath . For these examples we
explicitly compute generating functions both for @xmath and for small
@xmath . Section 5.5 deals with @xmath D-branes and gives a systematic
approach to the field theory computation by means of the Molien formula.
In this chapter we will mainly interested in regular horizon, the reader
interested in the singular horizon case, is referred to [ 54 ] , where
he can find some preliminary discussions and observations.

### 5.2 General Structure of Generating Functions for BPS Operators

In this section we will give general prescriptions on the computation of
generating functions for BPS operators in the chiral ring of a
supersymmetric gauge theory that lives on a D-brane which probes a
generic non-compact CY manifold @xmath . These will be of course
compatible with the simpler cases of the conifold that we have already
discussed in detail in the previous chapter.

Given an @xmath supersymmetric gauge theory with a collection of @xmath
global symmetries, @xmath , we have a set of @xmath chemical potentials
@xmath . The generating function for a gauge theory living on a D-brane
probing a generic non-compact CY manifold @xmath depends on the set of
parameters, @xmath . There is always at least one such @xmath global
symmetry and one such chemical potential @xmath , corresponding to the
@xmath symmetry.

The global charges are divided into classes: baryonic charges , and
flavor charges (by abuse of language, we will include the @xmath
-symmetry in this latter class). The number of non-anomalous flavor
symmetries, related to the isometries of @xmath , is less than three
while the number of non-anomalous baryonic symmetries, related to the
group of divisors in @xmath , can be quite large. In certain cases, we
can also have baryonic discrete symmetries. As is demonstrated below, in
addition to the non-anomalous baryonic charges we need to consider the
anomalous baryonic charges . We will only consider the case of toric CY
where the number of flavor symmetries is three. When it will be
necessary to make distinctions, we will denote with @xmath or @xmath the
flavor chemical potentials and with @xmath the non-anomalous baryonic
chemical potentials. Chemical potentials for anomalous charges are
denoted by @xmath .

For a given CY manifold @xmath , we denote the generating function for
@xmath D-branes by @xmath . The generating function for @xmath is simple
to compute by using field theory arguments. Indeed the quiver gauge
theory living on the world-volume of the D3-branes consists of a gauge
group @xmath , adjoint or bi-fundamental chiral fields @xmath , which
can be considered as @xmath matrices, and a superpotential @xmath .

For @xmath the matrices @xmath reduce to numbers and the F-term
conditions become polynomial equations in the commuting numbers @xmath .
We can consider the polynomial ring @xmath to be graded by the weights
@xmath . Since the gauge group is acting trivially for @xmath , the ring
of gauge invariants is just the quotient ring

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the set of F-term constraints @xmath . The generating
function for polynomials is the right now familiar Hilbert series which
we got used in chapter 2 to study the master space @xmath ; indeed
@xmath . It can be computed using the methods explained in chapter 2 and
it coincide with the Hilbert series of the master space @xmath . In
particular there is an algorithmic way to compute it using computer
algebra programs like Macaulay2 [ 74 ] . We can therefore assume that
the generating function @xmath for @xmath is known.

We proceed to the determination of @xmath with a general conjecture:

-    For the class of theories considered here (D-branes probing
    non-compact CY which are any of toric, orbifolds or complete
    intersections), the knowledge of the generating function for @xmath
    is enough to compute the generating function for any @xmath .

¿From the last two chapters this fact must be the right now familiar
statement that the mesonic and the baryonic operators for finite @xmath
are symmetric functions of the mesonic and baryonic operators for @xmath
.

The general construction is as follows. There exists a decomposition of
the @xmath ring of invariants @xmath , and consequently of its
generating function, into sectors @xmath of definite baryonic charges

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the generating function for the subsector @xmath . All
elements in @xmath have the same baryonic charges, and, except for a
multiplicative factor, @xmath only depends on the flavor charges @xmath
. In simple cases, like the conifold, @xmath is just a label running
over all the possible values of the non-anomalous baryonic charge. The
understanding of the precise decomposition of @xmath into subsectors in
the general case is a nontrivial task and is one of the subjects of this
chapter.

The generating function for @xmath branes is then obtained by taking
@xmath -fold symmetric products of elements in each given sector @xmath
. This is precisely the role which is played by the Plethystic
Exponential (PE) – to take a generating function for a set of operators
and count all possible symmetric functions of it. If we introduce a
chemical potential @xmath for the number of D-branes, the generating
function for any number of D-branes is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.2.2)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

This the generalization of the prescription we gave in section 4.2 to a
generic toric CY @xmath . The detailed description of the decomposition
into sectors @xmath is given in the rest of this chapter, but it is
important to notice from the very beginning that such a decomposition is
not unique. As already mentioned above, gauge invariants in the same
sector have the same baryonic charges. One can take these baryonic
charges to be non-anomalous. This however, turns out to be not enough
and we seem to need a finer decomposition of the ring of invariants
which is obtained by enlarging the set of non-anomalous baryonic charges
to a larger set. There are two basic extensions, one related to an
expansion in a full set of baryonic charges, anomalous and
non-anomalous, and the other extension is related to a full set of
discretized Kähler moduli on the CY resolutions. We thus have two
complementary points of view:

-    Quantum field theory perspective : the most general decomposition
    of the generating function @xmath is into the full set of baryonic
    charges. Let us extend the set of chemical potentials @xmath to all
    the baryonic charges, including the anomalous ones, denoted by
    @xmath . There are @xmath independent baryonic charges, where @xmath
    is the number of gauge groups. We can thus decompose @xmath into
    sectors with definite charges under @xmath . @xmath will decompose
    into a formal Laurent series in the baryonic chemical potentials
    @xmath and @xmath . The @xmath rings of invariants for number of
    colors @xmath will similarly decompose into sectors of definite
    baryonic charge. We can formally extend the gauge group @xmath to
    @xmath by gauging the baryonic symmetries. ¹ ¹ 1 The theory will of
    course be anomalous. The overall @xmath is discarded since it acts
    trivially. From this perspective, the decomposition of the ring of
    @xmath invariants into Abelian representations of the extended group
    @xmath is sometimes called an expansion in covariants and is
    extremely natural from the point of view of invariant theory. All
    sectors @xmath appear with multiplicity one in the decomposition of
    Equation ( 5.2.2 ).

-    The dual geometrical perspective : the full set of BPS states of
    the dual gauge theory can be obtained by quantizing the classical
    configuration space of supersymmetric D3-branes wrapped on the
    horizon. This problem can be equivalently rephrased in terms of
    holomorphic surfaces in the CY with @xmath as generating function [
    92 , 93 ] . Quite remarkably, @xmath has a decomposition

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (5.2.3)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    where the parameters @xmath can be identified with a complete set of
    discretized Kähler moduli and the integers @xmath are
    multiplicities. We will call it the GKZ decomposition , from the
    known description of the Kähler cone in terms of a secondary fan
    given by the GKZ construction. The functions @xmath can be
    explicitly determined with the computation of a character using the
    equivariant index theorem. This geometrical decomposition has
    multiplicities @xmath which will be interpreted in the following
    sections. The result for finite @xmath is generated by the following
    function

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (5.2.4)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    and can be interpreted as the result of quantizing the classical BPS
    D3-brane configuration in each sector @xmath .

The two decompositions of the @xmath generating function are different
and complementary. For a toric CY manifold that has a toric diagram with
@xmath external vertices and @xmath internal integral points, the number
of non-anomalous baryonic symmetries is @xmath , the number of anomalous
baryonic symmetries is @xmath and the dimension of the Kähler moduli
space is @xmath . The field theory expansion is thus based on a lattice
@xmath of dimension @xmath consisting of all baryonic charges, anomalous
or not, while the geometrical expansion is based on a lattice @xmath of
dimension @xmath . The two sets have a nontrivial intersection @xmath ,
consisting of non-anomalous baryonic charges.

At the end, we will be interested in the generating function for BPS
operators with chemical potential with respect to the non-anomalous
charges. To this purpose, we must project any of the two lattices on
their intersection, which is the @xmath lattice of non-anomalous
baryonic symmetries @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and multiplicities will generically appear.

On the other hand, we could even imagine to enlarge our lattices. Adding
the anomalous baryonic charges to the GKZ fan we obtain a lattice of
dimension @xmath . The points give hollow polygons over the GKZ fan. All
these issues will be discussed in detail in the rest of the chapter.

### 5.3 Expanding the @xmath Generating Function

As we have seen in the previous chapters our decomposition of the ring
of invariants of the gauge theory is a decomposition into different
types of determinants . Let us review its structure and fix the
notations. For simplicity, we will use the following notation: given a
pair of gauge groups @xmath , we call determinant of type @xmath a gauge
invariant of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath denotes a string of elementary fields with all gauge
indices contracted except two indices, @xmath and @xmath , corresponding
to the gauge groups @xmath . The index @xmath runs over all possible
strings of elementary fields with these properties. The full set of
invariants is obtained by arbitrary products of these determinants.
Using the tensor relation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

some of these products of determinants are equivalent and some of these
are actually equivalent to mesonic operators made only with traces. In
particular, mesons are included in the above description as determinants
of type @xmath .

We can decompose the ring of invariants according to the baryonic
charges, which indeed distinguish between different types of
determinants, or baryons. This decomposition is natural in field theory
and it also has a simple interpretation in the dual gravity theory.

In fact, in theories obtained from D3-branes at CY singularities,
baryons can be identified with branes wrapped on nontrivial cycles on
the base @xmath of the CY as explained in detail in chapter 3 . The
non-anomalous symmetries can be clearly identified in the dual theory.
In particular, states with the same non-anomalous baryonic charges can
be continuously deformed into each other: indeed we can relate the set
of non-anomalous baryonic charges to the group of three-cycles in @xmath
. The homology @xmath determines @xmath continuous baryonic charges (
@xmath is the number of vertices of the toric diagram) and possibly a
set of discrete baryonic charges from the torsion part @xmath .

Let us remind what happens in the particular case of the conifold,
previously analyzed. In the conifold there is one non-anomalous baryonic
charge (since @xmath ) which is related to the single three-cycle in the
base @xmath . There are only two gauge groups and two types of
determinants: @xmath and @xmath . The invariants decompose according to
the baryonic charge:

1.  @xmath corresponds to the mesons (D3-branes wrapping trivial cycles,
    giant gravitons [ 91 ] ),

2.  @xmath corresponds to the sector containing the determinants @xmath
    and all possible mesonic excitations (D3-branes wrapping @xmath
    times the 3-cycle),

3.  finally, @xmath corresponds to the sector containing the
    determinants @xmath and all possible mesonic excitations (D3-branes
    wrapping @xmath times the 3-cycle with opposite orientation).

The conifold picture is nice and in many ways elegant. However, a simple
look at any other quiver gauge theory reveals that this simple picture
is too naive. Consider, for example, the case of the orbifold @xmath
(see chapter 2 and Figure 5.2 ), that already reveals all types of
oddities:

-   Since @xmath , there is no continuous non-anomalous baryonic
    symmetry. However, @xmath and there is a discrete baryonic symmetry.
    We can indeed construct determinants for example, using the fields
    @xmath and @xmath with @xmath charge @xmath . These do not carry any
    continuous conserved charge since the product @xmath can be
    rewritten as a meson in terms of traces; for example, using @xmath
    we can write,

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    On the other hand, @xmath cannot be reduced to traces simply because
    there are no gauge invariant traces we can make with @xmath alone:
    we have actually an infinite number of products of determinants (
    @xmath for @xmath for example) that cannot be rewritten in terms of
    mesons. All these operators correspond in the ring of invariants to
    sectors that cannot be distinguished by the discrete baryonic
    charge.

-   The BPS D3-brane configurations wrap divisors in the CY: for @xmath
    we have just a single divisor @xmath satisfying @xmath and this
    agrees with the homology of the base @xmath . However, we also have
    a vanishing compact four-cycle which is represented in toric
    geometry by the integer internal point of the toric diagram. The
    size of this cycle becomes finite when we blow up the orbifold. It
    is conceivable that the inclusion of compact four-cycles such as
    this one will affect the description of the classical configuration
    space of D3-branes. This will add a new parameter, related to the
    group of divisors on the CY resolution, which has dimension one.

-   We could distinguish among elementary fields and types of
    determinants by using all the possible baryonic charges, including
    the anomalous ones. For @xmath this would lead to the inclusion of
    the two existing anomalous baryonic charges. As we will explain,
    this set of charges is different and complementary with respect to
    that related to the group of divisors on the resolution.

Having this example in mind, we now discuss the two possible expansions
of the ring of invariants. Explicit examples of the decompositions will
be presented in Section 5.4 . We encourage the reader to jump forth and
back with Section 5.4 for a better understanding of the material.

#### 5.3.1 Expanding in a Complete Set of Baryonic Charges

The most general decomposition of the @xmath generating function is
according to the full set of baryonic charges, including the anomalous
ones, denoted by @xmath . The sectors @xmath in this case correspond to
sectors with definite anomalous and non-anomalous baryonic charges.

There are @xmath independent baryonic charges, where @xmath is the
number of gauge groups. By gauging the baryonic symmetries, we would
obtain a quiver theory with the same fields and superpotential, and a
gauge group

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where we factor out the overall decoupled @xmath . Some of the @xmath
factors will be anomalous, of course. The baryonic charges have a very
natural description: they correspond to the @xmath factors in @xmath .
In this way, different elementary fields have the same baryonic charges
if and only if they are charged under the same gauge groups. This allows
to efficiently distinguish between invariants belonging to different
sectors. Notice that non-anomalous baryonic symmetries alone would not
distinguish all inequivalent possibilities. For example, in @xmath , the
mesonic operator @xmath and the determinant @xmath have the same charge
under @xmath , but different charges under the two anomalous baryonic
symmetries.

Let us thus extend the set of chemical potentials @xmath to all the
baryonic charges, including the anomalous ones. We can therefore
decompose @xmath into sectors with definite charges under @xmath .

The @xmath generating function @xmath will decompose into a formal
Laurent series in the baryonic chemical potentials @xmath and @xmath .
The explicit decomposition of @xmath into a formal Laurent series can be
done by repeatedly applying the residue theorem, in a similar way to
what we explained in the previous chapter; the computation however
quickly becomes involved, since the order of integration becomes crucial
and divides the result into many different cases.

The ring of invariants @xmath , will similarly decompose into sectors of
definite baryonic charges. The generating function @xmath can then be
computed according to Equation ( 5.2.2 ).

We can understand this decomposition in terms of representation theory.
¿From this perspective, we have decomposed the ring of @xmath invariants
into Abelian representations of the extended group @xmath . This is
sometimes called an expansion in covariants and is extremely natural
from the point of view of invariant theory. From our point of view,
covariants are just the possible set of independent determinants . Each
sector @xmath in @xmath will be specified by a certain number of gauge
group pairs @xmath and is associated to the subsector of the ring of
gauge invariants made with products of the determinants of type @xmath .

To make connection with the toric quiver gauge theories we notice that
we have the relation [ 101 ] :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath in the number of vertices of the toric diagram and @xmath
the number of integer internal points. Only @xmath of these baryonic
symmetries are not anomalous.

We expect all sectors @xmath to appear with multiplicity one in the
decomposition of Equation ( 5.2.2 ). In the following we will show some
examples of this decomposition.

#### 5.3.2 Supersymmetric D3-Branes and the GKZ Decomposition

As explained in chapter 3 the full set of BPS states of the dual gauge
theory can be obtained by quantizing the classical configuration space
of supersymmetric D3-branes wrapped on the horizon H. D3-brane
configurations are in one-to-one correspondence with holomorphic
four-cycles in the CY variety @xmath . Indeed our problem can be
equivalently rephrased in terms of holomorphic surfaces in @xmath with
@xmath as a generating function.

¿From this perspective, we have an obvious decomposition into sectors
@xmath corresponding to Euclidean D3-branes that can be continuously
deformed into each other in @xmath . Such D3-branes have the same
non-anomalous baryonic numbers; indeed, geometrically, the non-anomalous
baryonic charges are identified with the group of divisors modulo linear
equivalence.

Recall from section 3.2 that our conical CY @xmath is specified by a
toric diagram in the plane with @xmath vertices having integer
coordinates @xmath . To each vertices @xmath we can associate an
homogeneous coordinate @xmath , spanning @xmath , in term of which
@xmath is defined by the symplectic quotient: @xmath , where S is some
set, that in our affine case will be always the null set, and the group
G is defined in equation ( 3.2.1 ), ( 3.2.2 ). @xmath is isomorphic, in
general, to @xmath times a discrete group. The residual @xmath complex
torus action acting on @xmath is dual to the flavor symmetry group in
the gauge theory, while the group @xmath is dual to the non-anomalous
baryonic symmetry group. Notice that the flavor and baryonic symmetries
nicely combine in the full group of @xmath non-anomalous charges which
act naturally on the @xmath homogeneous coordinates @xmath as @xmath
acts on @xmath .

In toric geometry each edge @xmath determines a (not necessarily
compact) four-cycle @xmath in @xmath , and a generic four-cycle @xmath
is given by a linear combination of basic divisors @xmath where @xmath
are integer coefficients. The divisors are subject to the three linear
equivalence conditions @xmath , @xmath , where @xmath is a basis for
@xmath . The group of four-cycles modulo linear equivalence is
isomorphic to the baryonic group @xmath . It follows that the
non-anomalous baryonic symmetry distinguishes deformation equivalence
classes of Euclidean D3-branes.

However this is not the end of the story. The decomposition into
non-anomalous baryonic charges is not fine enough. A D3-brane state with
baryonic charge @xmath can form a sort of bound state which
distinguishes it from a set of @xmath D3-brane states with baryonic
charge one. This typically happens in theories where there are
elementary fields with multiple non-anomalous baryonic charges. By going
over examples, it easy to convince oneself that the classical D3 brane
configurations obtained from divisors on the singular CY @xmath do not
exhaust all possible sectors of the dual gauge theory. However, as
already mentioned, we have a plethora of compact vanishing four-cycles
that are expected to enter in the description of the set of
supersymmetric D3-branes and solve these ambiguities. We have exactly
@xmath compact vanishing four-cycles, one for each integer internal
point in the toric diagram. These cycles become of finite size in the
smooth resolutions @xmath of @xmath . We will see that with the addition
of these divisors we can give a convenient description of all sectors in
the dual gauge theory. It would be interesting to understand the
necessity for the inclusions of these divisors directly from the point
of view of the geometric quantization of classical supersymmetric branes
living on the horizon.

We are led to enlarge the set of basic divisors of size @xmath to a
larger set of size @xmath by adding a divisor @xmath for each internal
point of the toric diagram. We now have a larger group of divisors which
strictly contains the baryonic symmetry group. The larger set of
divisors immediately leads us to the description of the Kähler moduli
space @xmath , of dimension @xmath . This moduli space is still a toric
variety described by the so-called secondary fan, or GKZ fan, and it is
indeed parameterized by the divisors @xmath in the larger set.

##### The GKZ Decomposition

It is well known that there are many different smooth resolutions of the
CY corresponding to the possible complete triangulations of the toric
diagram. Different resolutions are connected by flops. The number of
Kähler moduli of the CY is @xmath where @xmath is the number of internal
points; this is the same as the number of geometrical FI terms that
appear in the symplectic quotient description of the resolved manifold.
This number can be greater than the number of non-anomalous baryonic
symmetries in field theory, which is @xmath .

There is an efficient description of the Kähler moduli space in terms of
divisors [ 102 ] . Take a complete resolution of the variety and
consider the set of all effective divisors

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

modulo the three linear equivalence conditions given by @xmath where
@xmath is the standard basis for @xmath and @xmath are the vertices of
the toric diagram, including the internal integer points. The @xmath
give a parametrization of the @xmath dimensional Kähler moduli provided
we impose a further condition: to have all cycles of positive volumes we
must consider only convex divisors. The convexity conditions can be
expressed as follows. Assign a number @xmath to the @xmath -th point in
the toric diagram. To each triangle @xmath in the triangulation of the
toric diagram we assign a vector @xmath which is the integer solution of
the system of three linear equations ² ² 2 Actually, these equations can
be solved for all simplicial resolutions, corresponding to not
necessarily maximal triangulations of the toric diagram. If we allow
triangles with area greater than one, we have resolved varieties which
still have orbifold singularities. For completely smooth resolutions,
the vertices of all triangles @xmath are primitive vectors in @xmath and
Equation ( 5.3.7 ) has integer solutions. Observe that, to avoid
ambiguities, we have changed a bit the notation from the one we used in
chapter 3 . ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and impose the inequalities

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The set of inequalities ( 5.3.8 ), as @xmath runs over all the
triangles, determines the convexity condition for the divisor. For a
given resolution, the set of convex divisors forms a cone in the @xmath
vector space, that parameterizes the Kähler moduli of the resolution.
The boundary of this cone corresponds to the vanishing of some cycle. If
we can perform a flop, we enter a new region in the moduli space
corresponding to a different resolution. Indeed, the cones constructed
via the convexity condition for the various possible resolutions of the
toric diagram form regions in the @xmath vector space that are adjacent;
altogether these reconstruct a collection of adjacent cones (a fan in
toric language) in @xmath . The toric variety constructed from this fan
in @xmath is the Kähler moduli space of the CY. This is known as the GKZ
fan, or secondary fan [ 103 , 104 ] . We move from a cone in the GKZ fan
to another by performing flops (or in case we also consider orbifold
resolutions by flops or further subdivisions of the toric diagram). It
is sufficient for us to consider smooth varieties and we thus reserve
the name GKZ fan to the collections of cones corresponding to smooth
resolutions.

The GKZ fans for the conifold and @xmath are given in Figures 5.1 , 5.6
, respectively.

We form a lattice by considering the integer points in the GKZ fan. We
claim that the @xmath generating function, or in other words the Hilbert
series for the Master space that we computed in chapter 2 , has an
expansion in sectors corresponding to the integer points of the GKZ
lattice. Denote by @xmath an integer point in the GKZ lattice, then

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the multiplicity of the point @xmath . Furthermore, we
conjecture that the finite @xmath generating function can be obtained as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

##### GKZ and Field Theory Content

At the heart of the previous formulae, there is a remarkable connection
between the GKZ decomposition and the quiver gauge theory. To fully
appreciate it we suggest to the reader to read this and the following
subsections in close parallel with section 5.4 where explicit examples
are given.

The integer points in the GKZ fan correspond to sectors in the quantum
field theory Hilbert space made out of determinants. Recall that mesons
in the quiver gauge theories correspond to closed paths in the quiver.
We want to associate similarly the other independent sectors made out of
determinants with equivalence classes of open paths in the dimers. The
open paths fall into equivalence classes @xmath specified by the choice
of ending points on the dimer. The open path in a given class can be
reinterpreted in the gauge theory as strings of elementary fields with
all gauge indices contracted except two corresponding to a choice of a
specific pair of gauge groups; let us call these composite fields .
Baryonic operators are written as “ @xmath ”, which is a schematic
expression for two epsilons contracted with @xmath composite fields
freely chosen among the representatives of the class @xmath . Generic
sectors are made with arbitrary products @xmath etc. Whenever open paths
@xmath and @xmath can be composed to give the open path @xmath , there
is at least one choice of representatives for @xmath and @xmath such
that we can write @xmath and we want to consider the two sectors @xmath
and @xmath equivalent. This can be enforced as follows. Denote with
letters @xmath the equivalence classes of arrows in the quiver
connecting different gauge groups. By decomposing open paths in strings
of letters, we can associate a sector with a string of letters. We
should however take into account the fact that if, for example, the
arrows @xmath make a closed loop, the operator

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is a meson. We take into account this fact by imposing the constraint
@xmath . Moreover, composite fields connecting the same pairs of gauge
groups as an elementary fields do not determine the existence of new
independent determinants; to avoid overcountings, the corresponding
string of letters should be set to zero. Analogously, whenever two
different strings of letters correspond to open paths with the same
endpoints, these strings should be identified. We call @xmath the set of
constraints obtained in this way and construct the ring

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Quite remarkably, the monomials in the ring @xmath are in correspondence
with the integer points in the GKZ fan. More precisely, we can grade the
ring with @xmath charges in such a way that the generating function of
@xmath , which we call the auxiliary GKZ partition function , and is
denoted by @xmath , counts the integer points in the GKZ fan. Moreover,
any integer point @xmath comes with a multiplicity @xmath which is the
one in Equation ( 5.3.9 ).

We have explicitly verified the above statement in all the examples we
studied and we conjecture that it is a general result for all toric
diagrams: the auxiliary partition function counting open paths in the
quiver modulo equivalence coincides with the generating function for the
GKZ lattice dressed with field theory multiplicities. Just another
remarkable connection between apparently different objects:
combinatorics on the tiling, geometry of @xmath and gauge theory!

As another example of this fascinating correspondence, we will see that
it is possible to eliminate multiplicities by refining the GKZ lattice.
This is done by enlarging the set of charges. In particular, we have
found that, if we refine the GKZ lattice by adding the anomalous
baryonic charges, we obtain a “hollow cone” in @xmath with no
multiplicities.

As previously explained in a generic toric quiver gauge theory there are
@xmath anomalous baryonic symmetries, where @xmath is the number of
internal integer points. The variables in the auxiliary GKZ ring @xmath
corresponds to arrows in the quiver and therefore can be assigned a
definite charge under the baryonic symmetries that are just the ungauged
@xmath gauge group factors. We can therefore grade the auxiliary ring
@xmath with a set of @xmath weights: the original @xmath discretized
Kähler parameters @xmath of the GKZ lattice plus the @xmath anomalous
baryonic weights @xmath . The power series expansion of the auxiliary
partition function @xmath will draw a lattice in @xmath which has the
shape of an hollow cone over the GKZ fan: over each point of the GKZ fan
there is a hollow polygon @xmath whose shape is related to the pq-web of
the toric geometry. Quite remarkably, all points in the lattice come
with multiplicity one. Examples for @xmath and @xmath are presented in
Figure 5.3 and 5.7 .

##### Computing @xmath for one D Brane in a Sector @xmath Using
Localization

To compute the partition functions @xmath we need to apply the procedure
explained in section 3.6 to every integer point @xmath in the GKZ fan.
Indeed to every @xmath is associated a smooth resolution of @xmath and a
particular divisor @xmath on it. Extending our interpretation of the BPS
states in terms of supersymmetric D3-branes wrapping holomorphic cycles
in the singular CY to its resolution, we have a natural definition for
the function @xmath : it should count all the sections of the line
bundle @xmath corresponding to holomorphic surfaces in the given linear
equivalence class. Therefore @xmath is just the character @xmath under
the action of the element @xmath of the torus of flavor symmetries. All
elements in @xmath have the same baryonic charges. As we have explained
section 3.6 the higher cohomology groups of a convex line bundle vanish
and the character then coincides with the holomorphic Lefschetz number
that can be computed with the equivariant index theorem. Following
section 3.6 we can expresses the result as a sum over the fixed points
@xmath of the torus @xmath action on the particular smooth resolution of
@xmath corresponding to the point @xmath in the GKZ lattice:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the index @xmath denotes the set of isolated fixed points and the
four vectors @xmath , @xmath in @xmath are the weights of the linearized
action of @xmath on the resolved CY and the fiber of the line bundle
@xmath , respectively. The fixed points of the torus action are in
correspondence with the triangles in the subdivision of the toric
diagram. The vectors @xmath in the denominator of Equation ( 5.3.11 )
are computed as the three primitive inward normal vectors of the cone
@xmath in @xmath made with the three vertices @xmath of the I-th
triangle. The vector @xmath in the numerator is instead computed as in
Equation ( 5.3.7 ): @xmath . The prefactor @xmath in Equation ( 5.3.11 )
is just the charge of the divisor @xmath . The full dependence on
baryonic charges in encoded in this prefactor.

In explicit computations, some care should be paid to the choice of
charges. There is a natural geometric basis for the non-anomalous
charges of the gauge theory. In fact, the homogeneous coordinates @xmath
that are used to define @xmath as a symplectic quotient are extremely
useful to assign a full set of @xmath (flavor+baryonic) charges to the
elementary fields in the quiver; this is done using zig-zag paths and
standard dimers techniques [ 19 , 35 ] . All the elementary fields have
charge which is given by a product of the @xmath . We can also assign
charge @xmath to the divisor @xmath of the singular cone. In all the
examples we have considered there is a natural way to assign charges to
the enlarged set of divisors entering the GKZ decomposition. This allows
to compute the prefactor @xmath . The @xmath decompose into three flavor
charges and @xmath baryonic charges. The splitting of the charges @xmath
into flavor and baryonic charges is not unique in general; flavor
charges can be always redefined by adding a linear combination of the
baryonic charges. However, a toric diagram comes with a specific basis
for the flavor @xmath action which is determined by the equation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath are the basis vectors of @xmath and @xmath the vertices of
the toric diagram. Notice that all dependence on baryonic charges drops
from the right hand side. This is the @xmath basis that should be used
in the localization formula ( 5.3.11 ).

##### Checks with all Charges: GKZ Approach vs. Field Theory

Having understood how to compute and resolve the multiplicities in the
GKZ cones and to compute the partition functions we can also refine our
decomposition of the @xmath generating function by adding the anomalous
baryonic charges.

Using the equivariant index theorem we compute all the generating
functions @xmath for all points @xmath in the GKZ lattice. We can use
@xmath coordinates for the GKZ cone @xmath . Denote also with @xmath the
non-anomalous baryonic charge corresponding to the point @xmath of the
GKZ lattice. As discussed in Section 5.3.2 , the generating functions
depend on the baryonic charges only by a multiplicative factor: @xmath
and all the other dependence is on the flavor charges @xmath . Thanks to
the auxiliary generating functions we were able to find expressions for
the multiplicities @xmath of the fields over each point of the GKZ
lattice. These functions sum up to the complete generating functions
with @xmath and with all the non-anomalous charges:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath are the chemical potentials for the non-anomalous baryonic
charges. To resolve the multiplicities @xmath we construct the hollow
cone by adding the anomalous baryonic charges. Over each point in the
GKZ lattice there is a hollow polygon @xmath which can be parametrized
in terms of the set of @xmath anomalous charges @xmath with @xmath ,
such that:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Using these resolutions we obtain the resolved generating functions for
@xmath with all the charges, anomalous and non-anomalous:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The non flavor charges do not appear in the basic generating functions
@xmath , but they are multiplicative factors over which one has to sum
up, in the same way one does for the usual non-anomalous baryonic
charges.

We would like to stress that Equation ( 5.3.15 ) points to a remarkable
connection between the geometry of @xmath , which is used to compute the
right hand side, and the field theory, that can be used to determine the
left hand side (the @xmath generating function). In other words, we have
two different ways of computing the @xmath generating @xmath function
which nicely match:

-   In the first case we use the GKZ geometric picture explained in the
    previous sections. We first compute the generating functions @xmath
    for each point in the GKZ lattice which depend on the flavor
    charges. We next sum over all the points of the hollow cone by
    dressing @xmath with the appropriate weight under the baryonic
    symmetries.

-   In the second case we use the field theory picture. We can take the
    fields of the gauge theory as basic variables and we assign to them
    all the possible charges anomalous and non-anomalous. This means
    that we construct the ring generated by the fundamental fields and
    we grade it with all the charges. Then we construct the quotient
    ring by modding out the ring of elementary fields by the ideal
    generated by @xmath -term equations. Using Macaulay2 we compute the
    Hilbert series of the quotient ring obtaining the completed resolved
    generating function with all the charges of the field theory: @xmath
    .

As we will explicitly demonstrate on the examples in Section 5.4 , the
two computations completely agree.

As a final remark, we notice that Equation ( 5.3.15 ) is the most
general decomposition of the @xmath generating function that we can
write. We can close our circular discussion and go back to the initial
point. Equation ( 5.3.15 ) has been obtained by enlarging the GKZ
lattice in order to eliminate multiplicities. The hollow cone is a
lattice in @xmath dimensions. The corresponding @xmath charges contain,
as a subset, all the anomalous and non-anomalous baryonic charges that
are in number @xmath . Notice that the terms in series in Equation (
5.3.15 ) depend on the extra @xmath GKZ parameters only through the
factor @xmath . By projecting the hollow cone on the @xmath dimensional
space of baryonic charges we obtain the explicit expansion of the @xmath
generating function @xmath in a complete set of baryonic charges which
was discussed in Section 5.3.1 . One can compare this expansion with the
one obtained by performing repeated contour integrations. As one can
check explicitly, the points in the baryonic charge lattice have still
multiplicity one.

### 5.4 Examples

In this section we explicitly compute the @xmath generating function for
certain toric CY manifolds @xmath and decompose it. Then we apply the PE
function to every sector and we obtain the generating functions for
@xmath . We start by revisiting the example of the conifold, and then we
present the example of @xmath and @xmath .

#### 5.4.1 The Conifold Revisited

To demonstrate our general discussion above and to prepare for more
involved cases we start by reviewing the generating function for the
conifold.

The generating function for the conifold can be written as 4.3.3 :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Let us start setting @xmath for simplicity.

@xmath decomposes into sectors with fixed baryonic charge @xmath , each
with multiplicity one:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.17)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

It is manifest that each term in @xmath has a monomial @xmath
corresponding to a baryonic charge @xmath . Observe that the
decomposition in equation ( 5.4.17 ) shows explicitly that every sector
with fixed baryonic charge @xmath decompose in symmetric representations
of dimension @xmath of the global symmetry group @xmath . As we
explained in the previous two chapters the decomposition into each
baryonic charge can be computed by expanding @xmath in a formal Laurent
series in @xmath or by determining the functions @xmath by resolving
@xmath , see Figure 5.1 , and using the equivariant index theorem.

It is right now clear that the decomposition has an interpretation in
terms of supersymmetric D3-branes states: @xmath counts the
supersymmetric D3-branes wrapping cycles of homology @xmath thus
corresponding to states with baryonic number @xmath . As already
observed in the previous chapter quite remarkably, the structure of the
integer lattices with generating function @xmath and the explicit
computation with the index theorem, strongly suggests a relation between
@xmath and a discretized Kähler modulus of the resolved CY [ 27 ] .

The result for generic @xmath is obtained as follows

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and a list of generating functions for small values of @xmath is given
in section 4.4.1 .

The conifold has only one baryonic charge, not anomalous, which can be
used to parametrize the Kähler moduli space. The two expansions, one in
baryonic charges, the other according to the GKZ lattice, coincide.

##### Baryonic Charge Expansion

We first expand the @xmath generating function, Equation ( 5.4.16 ) for
the conifold according to the baryonic charge

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

@xmath can be computed using the inversion formula

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with a careful evaluation of the contour integral for positive and
negative values of the baryonic charge @xmath (see the previous chapter
for a detailed explanation):

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

By setting @xmath and @xmath we recover expansion ( 5.4.17 ).

##### GKZ Decomposition

We can similarly perform a GKZ decomposition of the @xmath generating
function. In Figure 3.6 the toric diagram and the two resolutions of the
conifold are reported. There are four divisors @xmath subject to three
relations that leave an independent divisor @xmath , @xmath . Consider
the cone of effective divisors @xmath modulo linear equivalence in
@xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where we defined @xmath . For each resolution, we solve Equation ( 5.3.7
) for the two triangles in the resolution, or, equivalently, the two
vertices of the pq-web; the resulting vectors @xmath and @xmath are
reported in black and red respectively in Figure 3.6 . The convexity
condition, Equation ( 5.3.8 ), then tells us that the resolution on the
left corresponds to @xmath and the resolution on the right to @xmath .
Altogether we obtain two half lines (cones) in @xmath that form the GKZ
fan as in Figure 5.1 . The point of intersection @xmath of the two cones
corresponds to the singular conifold and the two cones in the fan are
related by a flop transition.

We now compute the generating functions @xmath using localization. As
mentioned in the previous section, we must pay attention to the
normalization of charges. The homogeneous coordinates for the conifold
are extremely simple: @xmath , which can be easily translated in the
notations of Section 5.4.1 . The natural flavor @xmath basis is then
given by Equation ( 5.3.12 )

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We are ready to apply the localization formula. Each point in the GKZ
fan is associated with a resolution and a divisor: for @xmath we use the
resolution on the left in Figure 3.6 and @xmath , while for @xmath the
resolution on the right and the divisor @xmath . The weights are
reported in Figure 3.6 . Equation ( 5.3.11 ) and Equation ( 5.4.22 )
give

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

which coincides with the result previously obtained in Equation (
LABEL:rescon ).

##### Conifold: Multiplicities in the GKZ Decomposition

The multiplicities in the GKZ decomposition of the @xmath generating
function for the conifold are trivial since they are all equal to 1.
Nevertheless it is instructive to follow the procedure which is outlined
in Section 5.3.2 in order to compute the multiplicities using the
auxiliary GKZ partition function @xmath which counts independent sectors
in the ring of invariants. As explained in Section 5.3.2 , we assign a
letter @xmath to the two types of arrows in the quiver @xmath . There is
only one relation @xmath corresponding to the closed loop in the quiver.
The polynomial ring for the GKZ decomposition of the conifold is
therefore

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We thus compute the generating function for the polynomial ring (which
can be easily computed by observing it is a complete intersection), with
chemical potential @xmath to @xmath and @xmath to @xmath we find

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

By expanding this auxiliary partition function we find multiplicity
@xmath for the integer points @xmath , multiplicity 1 for the integer
points @xmath , and multiplicity 1 for the point @xmath , reproducing
the lattice depicted in Figure 5.1 . We finally have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which appears to be a trivial observation as a Laurent series in the
baryonic chemical potential but in fact turns out to be nontrivial for
more involved singularities.

Now that we have rephrased the conifold example in the general setup of
the GKZ decomposition, we can apply this general method to more involved
singularities @xmath .

#### 5.4.2 Generating Functions for @xmath

We have already analyzed the master space of the @xmath in chapter 2 :
it is a five dimensional irreducible toric CY variety. For visual
simplicity we report here in Figure 5.2 its quiver and toric diagram.
The gauge theory has three sets of bifundamental fields @xmath with
@xmath and a superpotential @xmath .

###### Symmetries and Geometry

In chapter 2 we discovered that the master space @xmath has the
symmetries @xmath , where the last factor is an “hidden symmetry” not
manifest in the UV Lagrangian. In this section we will just consider the
UV symmetries and we will come back to the hidden ones in the following
chapter.

The UV global flavor symmetry is @xmath . All the fields have R-charge
@xmath and each set of three fields transform in the fundamental
representation of @xmath . One can also define two anomalous baryonic
@xmath charges which can be chosen to be

  -- -- -------- -------- --
        @xmath   @xmath   
        @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -- -------- -------- --

There are some non-anomalous discrete symmetries [ 105 ] acting on the
fields as follows,

  -- -- -------- -------- --
        @xmath   @xmath   
        @xmath   @xmath   
        @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -- -------- -------- --

We see that @xmath is a subgroup of @xmath and @xmath is subgroup of
@xmath . @xmath is related to the torsion homology group for three
cycles and, in a sense, is a discrete baryonic charge.

The symplectic quotient description of @xmath is as follow. Since @xmath
we introduce three homogeneous coordinates @xmath . The group @xmath of
baryonic charges is defined by the Equations ( 3.2.1 ), ( 3.2.2 ):

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which implies @xmath with @xmath . The symplectic quotient description
of the CY just reduces to the orbifold description @xmath , as expected.

As already discussed, the homogeneous coordinates can be used to give a
full set of weights for non-anomalous symmetries to the elementary
fields. We can write @xmath in terms of the discrete baryonic charge
@xmath and the flavors @xmath . The assignment of charges to the fields
is done using standard dimer techniques and is reported in Table 5.1 .
One can notice that @xmath are the charges of the original @xmath SYM.
To keep track of the coordinates on the two dimensional projection in
Figure 5.2 we introduce three chemical potentials @xmath which count the
@xmath -charge, and the @xmath integral positions, respectively and read
from the figure @xmath .

The full set of continuous charges, anomalous or not, is summarized in
the Table 5.1 , as well as the chemical potentials and the assignment of
homogeneous coordinates to the fields.

##### The @xmath Generating Function

The @xmath generating function, or Hilbert series for the master space
@xmath , was computed in section 2.2 with respect to just the R charge
with the result:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

##### The GKZ Decomposition

In the singular CY there is only one independent divisor @xmath with
@xmath . This reflects the @xmath discrete charge. However, on the
smooth resolution of the orbifold there is a new divisor @xmath
corresponding to the internal point. @xmath is still true but now @xmath
is non-zero, but equal instead to @xmath . The cone of effective
divisors in @xmath is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the convexity condition, Equation ( 5.3.8 ), requires @xmath . The
GKZ fan is thus a half-line in @xmath . The integer parameter @xmath
turns out to be the discrete Kähler modulus of the resolution of @xmath
, measuring the discrete area of the two cycle.

The right basis for localization is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and we compute (notice that the discrete baryonic charge @xmath
correctly drops out from this formula) @xmath . We thus obtain ³ ³ 3
These partition functions reduce for @xmath to the three independent
partition functions for nontrivial divisors on the singular cone.

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

@xmath is identified with the Molien invariant for the discrete group
@xmath and indeed computes the mesonic generating function as explained
in detail in [ 23 ] . In the limit @xmath we find

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.28)
  -- -------- -- ----------

##### Multiplicities

The multiplicities in the GKZ decomposition of the @xmath generating
function can be computed using @xmath , the auxiliary GKZ partition
function counting independent sectors in the ring of invariants. As
explained in Section 5.3.2 , we assign a letter @xmath to the three
types of arrows in the quiver @xmath . There is only one relation @xmath
corresponding to the closed loop in the quiver. We thus get the
polynomial ring

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and compute the generating function (which can be easily computed by
assuming it is a complete intersection), with charge @xmath to all
letters obtaining

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.30)
  -- -------- -- ----------

By expanding this auxiliary partition function we find multiplicity
@xmath for the point @xmath and multiplicity 1 for the point @xmath .
This is easily understood: the independent sectors contain determinants
of the form @xmath with @xmath or similar with @xmath permuted; there
are @xmath such sectors. This point will be further elaborated below.

We finally have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.31)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This can be summed easily using Equations ( 5.4.2 ) and ( 5.4.30 ) and
gives

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

For the special case @xmath we can take the limit or resum, using
Equation ( 5.4.28 ),

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which is exactly Equation ( 5.4.26 ).

##### Refining the GKZ Decomposition

Using Equation ( 5.4.30 ) we summarize the multiplicities

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.33)
  -- -------- -- ----------

For a dibaryon, the AdS/CFT dual object is a D3-brane that wraps a
@xmath cycle ⁴ ⁴ 4 Generically, @xmath is a Lens space. in @xmath . The
homology tells us that the wrapping number is characterized by an
integer, modulo 3. By resolving the singular Calabi-Yau, this gets
promoted to a (non-negative) integer which is just the coordinate @xmath
in the GKZ cone. The GKZ fan does not take into account the possible
topologically nontrivial flat connections on the wrapped D3-brane. To
avoid multiplicities, we include the U(1) extensions of all the discrete
charges. The R-charge is already a coordinate in the GKZ fan and its
corresponding GKZ auxiliary generating function is given in Equation (
5.4.30 ). The remaining charges are the anomalous charges @xmath and
@xmath , as given in Table 5.1 , which we now add to the lattice as
extra coordinates. The points in the resulting lattice form a “hollow
cone” and have no multiplicities.

The dressed auxiliary GKZ partition function which now also contains the
anomalous charges can be computed using the assumption that the
polynomial ring, Equation ( 5.4.29 ), is a complete intersection,

  -- -- -------- -------- --
                 @xmath   
        @xmath   @xmath   
        @xmath   @xmath   
        @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -- -------- -------- --

By drawing the lattice points in the @xmath lattice one can see that
there is a “hollow triangle” @xmath above each point @xmath in the 1d
GKZ cone (Figure 5.3 ), with edge length measured by the R-charge. This
gives the @xmath multiplicities. The same triangle appears in the pq-web
(Figure 5.4 ) of the geometry. This is a general feature as we will see
in other examples. The polygon in the fiber parameterized by the
anomalous charges nicely matches the shape of the blown-up cycle in the
pq-web.

We can now refine the decomposition ( 5.4.31 ) by introducing the
anomalous charges. We first write the expansion ( 5.4.2 ) in the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the two-dimensional index @xmath runs over the points of the
hollow triangle @xmath .

We can then refine the decomposition ( 5.4.31 ) by replacing the
multiplicity @xmath with @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.35)
  -- -------- -- ----------

By explicit computation we can resum the previous series and compare
with the expected field theory result, finding perfect agreement. The
left hand side of formula ( 5.4.35 ) is indeed the @xmath generating
function depending on all the five chemical potentials, which can be
computed as the Hilbert series for the polynomial ring of the F-term
equations using the grading in Table 5.1 ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is a polynomial in the gauge theory chemical potentials

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (5.4.37)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We would like to stress that decomposition ( 5.4.35 ) is highly
nontrivial. The right hand side has been computed from the geometrical
localization formulae and the refined GKZ auxiliary generating function.
It is then remarkable that the sum on the right hand side coincides with
the field theory @xmath generating function.

Using Equations ( 5.4.2 ) and ( 5.4.2 ) we get the following simpler
expression

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Formula ( 5.4.2 ) has the general structure of equation ( 3.6.55 ) and
suggests the existence of a localization formula for the holomorphic
functions on the @xmath moduli space, which is a five-dimensional
variety with an action of five @xmath symmetries, three flavor plus two
baryonic. In the following section we will see that @xmath for the
@xmath gauge theory has the same localization structure. It is possible
to verify that the @xmath generating function has the general structure
of equation ( 3.6.55 ) for other examples [ 28 ] . This is a consistency
check that our counting procedure really reproduce the moduli space for
@xmath brane. Indeed we know from chapter 2 that the moduli space for
just one brane is a @xmath dimensional toric variety and it is in some
sense reasonable that the BPS spectrum over the moduli space can be
counted directly applying an index theorem as explained in section 3.6 .
We will add more comments about this phenomena in the following section
when we will understand better the correspondence between the field
theory and the geometric computation.

By projecting the refined GKZ expansion on the plane @xmath we would get
the expansion of the @xmath generating functions into sectors with
definite baryonic charge. The same result can be obtained by expanding
@xmath in a Laurent series by means of the residue theorem. It is easy
to check that the multiplicity of each sector is one.

##### Generating Functions for @xmath

The generating function @xmath is now obtained from the general formula
( 5.2.2 ) starting from any decomposition of the @xmath generating
function, the GKZ decomposition ( 5.4.31 ), the refined GKZ
decomposition ( 5.4.35 ) or the anomalous baryonic charge decomposition.
Since we are interested in writing generating functions depending on the
non-anomalous charges, at the end of the computation @xmath should be
set to one.

The more economical way of obtaining @xmath is to start from
decomposition ( 5.4.31 ). The generating function for @xmath D-branes is
now given by the plethystic exponentiation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.39)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The cases @xmath and @xmath (with only one charge @xmath ) are given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Taking the Plethystic Logarithm for these expressions we find 9
generators for @xmath , 18 baryonic and 10 mesonic for @xmath , 30
baryonic and 10 mesonic for @xmath , 45 baryonic, 10 mesonic of @xmath
charge 2, 28 mesonic of @xmath charge 4 for @xmath , etc. By taking the
order of the pole at @xmath we find the dimension of the moduli space is
@xmath : 3N dimensions for the mesonic moduli space and 2 dimensions for
the baryonic fibers over it. All of this agrees with the field theory
expectations.

#### 5.4.3 Generating Functions for @xmath

@xmath is a @xmath freely acting orbifold of the conifold. We report
here for simplicity the toric diagram and the quiver of its first phase
Figure 5.5 . We will analyze here just the first toric phase of @xmath
and from now on @xmath . The quiver gauge theory has four types of
fields @xmath . and the superpotential is @xmath .

###### Symmetries and Geometry

In section 2.4.3 we have shown that the master space of @xmath is a
toric six dimensional variety that is reducible in the union of a six
dimensional CY cone: the product of two conifold @xmath and two four
dimensional complex planes: @xmath . The symmetry of @xmath is @xmath .
The last factor is an “hidden symmetry” that is not manifest in the UV
Lagrangian. In this section we will analyze just the UV symmetries and
we will come back to the hidden symmetries in the next chapter.

Including flavor charges, we find a rank six global UV symmetry denoted
by @xmath . The basic fields have transformation rules under the global
symmetry which are summarized in Table 5.2 .

We can explicitly examine the geometry of @xmath in the symplectic
quotient description. To this purpose, since @xmath , we introduce four
homogeneous coordinates @xmath in @xmath and we define the group of
rescaling @xmath which consists of a continuous charge acting as @xmath
on the @xmath and of a discrete one @xmath with @xmath . This implies
that the manifold, as we know, is a @xmath quotient of the conifold

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.40)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The homogeneous charges @xmath can be represented by chemical potentials
as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

in terms of the discrete baryonic charge @xmath and the chemical
potentials @xmath and @xmath ; notations are inherited from original
conifold theory. For future reference, we notice that the right basis
for localization is given by @xmath and we compute @xmath .

##### The @xmath Generating Function

As we have already seen in section 2.4.3 the master space @xmath is
reducible. Here we decide to study only the irreducible component of the
moduli space which contains the generic point with all fields different
from zero: @xmath . Algebraically, this is obtained by taking the
closure of the open set @xmath and give the product of two conifold. We
will see that the geometry of the CY: the complex cone over @xmath :
@xmath , nicely captures this branch of the moduli space. The other
branches can be added by performing surgeries as in we have shown in
section 2.4.3 . The @xmath generating function for the generic branch is
given in equation ( 2.4.53 ). Introducing just the two field theory
chemical potentials @xmath , @xmath in Table 5.2 for the fields @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath , @xmath respectively, we can distinguish between the
two conifold in @xmath , and we obtain:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.41)
  -- -------- -- ----------

##### The GKZ Decomposition

On the singular cone, there is just one independent divisor @xmath as
for the conifold. On the resolution, there is a new divisor @xmath
corresponding to the internal point. @xmath and @xmath are still true
but now @xmath and @xmath are different. We can parametrize the GKZ fan
in @xmath with @xmath . The integer parameters @xmath and @xmath have
the interpretation as the discrete Kähler parameters of @xmath , namely
the discrete areas of the two @xmath ’s. In this case, the convexity
condition requires @xmath . The GKZ cone is depicted in Figure 5.6 and
the multiplicities are presented in Equation ( 5.4.50 ). Notice that the
QFT baryonic charge is given by @xmath , so the sector @xmath
corresponds to the positive baryonic charges and the sector @xmath
corresponds to the negative ones.

It is interesting to note that the line @xmath contains the sectors with
zero baryonic charge. It is not however true that operators with zero
baryonic charges are made with traces; this is only true for @xmath .
The other sectors on the line @xmath correspond to determinants of the
form @xmath .

Localization now gives (using the complete set of charges @xmath )

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The dependence on the baryonic charge can be obtained by replacing
@xmath and @xmath and, as expected, is given by a multiplicative factor

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The generating function for @xmath can be nicely written as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.43)
  -- -------- -- ----------

It is then obvious that, for example, the mesonic partition function
@xmath can be obtained from the mesonic partition function for the
conifold 5.4.17 by projecting on the @xmath invariant part ( @xmath ).

##### Multiplicities and Seiberg Duality

To extract multiplicities we use the auxiliary partition function for
the GKZ cone. We introduce letters @xmath for the four possible classes
of arrows. The only relation that they form is related to the closed
loop @xmath . The generating function is the Hilbert series of the
polynomial ring

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.44)
  -- -------- -- ----------

By assigning chemical potential @xmath to @xmath and @xmath to @xmath we
obtain the auxiliary GKZ partition function for multiplicities:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

¿From which we can extract the following multiplicities, @xmath for
@xmath , @xmath for @xmath , and @xmath for @xmath .

We thus have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.46)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and one computes, using Equation ( 5.4.43 ),

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.47)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which is exactly Equation ( 5.4.41 ).

This is a rather important point. We have just seen that the geometrical
counting procedure reproduce just the coherent component @xmath of the
moduli space. This is a quite interesting result. Indeed in section
2.4.3 we accumulated some evidences, from the field theory point of
view, that the two coherent components @xmath of two Seiberg equivalent
CFT have the same Hilbert series written just in term of the non
anomalous symmetries. From the geometric computation we have just
presented, this fact means that the GKZ construction must be invariant
under Seiberg duality: namely the auxiliary GKZ partition function
restricted to the non anomalous charges is the same in the two phases of
@xmath . Indeed for the second phase of @xmath we have the quiver in
figure 2.6 . If we call @xmath the arrows along the diagonal and @xmath
, @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , the four arrows along the square, the
relations they satisfy are: @xmath , @xmath , @xmath . The generating
function for the second phase is the Hilbert series of the polynomial
ring ⁵ ⁵ 5 To do not make too heavy the notation in all this chapter we
will call @xmath the first toric phase of the @xmath gauge theory, and
@xmath the second toric phase.

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.48)
  -- -------- -- ----------

By assigning chemical potential @xmath to @xmath , @xmath to @xmath and
@xmath to @xmath we obtain the auxiliary GKZ partition function for
multiplicities for the second phase of @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.49)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This is exactly the auxiliary GKZ partition function of the phase I (
5.4.3 ), meaning that the GKZ construction is invariant under Seiberg
duality. We have previously observed that the geometric reconstruction
of the BPS spectrum is sensitive just to the coherent component of the
moduli space. Indeed the invariance under Seiberg duality of the GKZ
partition function is the geometric dual of the invariance of the
Hilbert series, refined by all the chemical potentials associated to the
non anomalous U(1) symmetries, of the coherent component of the master
space.

It seems that this fact, that we have shown just for the @xmath theory,
is going to repeat for other examples as well. For a detailed analysis
of the @xmath case, and more general examples, we refer the reader to [
80 ] . We conclude that both from the field theory and from the geometry
we can guess that the Hilbert series for non anomalous charges of the
coherent component of the master space is invariant under Seiberg
duality. This fact suggests the presence of some “quantum” corrections
to the classical moduli space of the field theory. We could in principle
obtain some informations regarding the “quantum” corrected moduli space
from the dual gravity setup (observe that we are here taking the non
trivial extrapolation from @xmath to @xmath !).

In this section we have seen that the Hilbert series for @xmath is
exactly reproduced by the counting of supesymmetric D3 branes in @xmath
. It would be interesting to understand if and how the linear components
of @xmath are reproduced by the geometry of @xmath , and if the Hilbert
series obtained from the geometric setup could give some hints to
understand the possible deformations to the classical field theory
moduli spaces and their behavior under Seiberg dualities.

##### Refining the GKZ Decomposition and Seiberg Duality

The auxiliary partition function in Equation ( 5.4.3 ) is derived by
computing the Hilbert series of the GKZ ring in Equation ( 5.4.44 ). By
expanding this partition function we get multiplicities in the @xmath
lattice given by the following infinite matrix,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.50)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In order to avoid getting multiplicities, let us introduce the chemical
potentials for the anomalous charges given in Table 5.2 . Using
Macaulay2, or the fact that we are dealing with a complete intersection,
we can write the auxiliary partition function dressed with these new
charges as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.51)
  -- -------- -- ----------

By expanding this function, we see that above each point in the GKZ fan,
parametrized by @xmath , there is a rectangle @xmath in the @xmath
lattice as in Figure 5.7 . The related rectangle in the pq-web is shown
in Figure 5.8 .

We can thus refine our decomposition of the @xmath partition function.
Equation ( 5.4.46 ) can be replaced by the following formula where all
multiplicities are lifted:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.52)
  -- -------- -- ----------

One can explicitly resum the right hand side, computed from geometrical
data and the auxiliary GKZ generating functions, and compare it with the
@xmath generating function as computed by field theory. By resumming the
series in Equation ( 5.4.52 ) we indeed recover the generating function
for @xmath with all anomalous and non-anomalous charges; this is given
by the Hilbert series for the polynomial ring of @xmath in section 2.4.3
and is easily computed using the fact that we deal with a complete
intersection,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.53)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- ----------

For completeness we can rewrite this expression by summing using
Equations ( 5.4.3 ) and ( 5.4.51 ),

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

As in the case of @xmath in section 5.4.2 this formula suggests that
some localization is at work in the field theory @xmath moduli space
@xmath , which is a six dimensional toric variety with the action of six
@xmath flavor and baryonic symmetries as described in chapter 2 . From
equation ( 5.4.47 ) we can refine our observation by guessing that the
counting of sections of line bundles with multiplicities over @xmath is
equivalent to the counting of holomorphic functions over @xmath .

Indeed we can count the complete chiral spectra of the gauge theory in
two different geometrical way: in the first one we start from the three
dimensional singularity @xmath and we count all the sections of all the
divisors according to the GKZ decomposition taking into account the
field theory multiplicities:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.55)
  -- -------- -- ----------

this is the way we are following in this chapter and it reveals very
useful for extending the computation to generic @xmath ; the second way
is more natural from the point of view of the study of the complete
moduli space @xmath of the field theory and it fit very well with the
discussion in chapter 2 . The trivial observation is that the set all
the @xmath BPS operators are exactly the set of all holomorphic
functions over the complete moduli space @xmath ( i.e. sections of the
trivial bundle @xmath over @xmath in the language of the section 3.6 ).
In chapter 2 we have shown that the moduli space @xmath for @xmath
brane, namely the master space @xmath , is a toric variety composed by a
CY toric cone of dimension @xmath called the coherent component @xmath ,
and a set of lower dimensional linear spaces @xmath . Hence if we want
to count the holomorphic functions over @xmath we just need to extend
the formalism for trivial bundle developed in section 3.6 from three to
@xmath dimensions:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.56)
  -- -------- -- ----------

this character can be computed applying index theorem on the trivial
line bundle @xmath over @xmath and it takes the form ( 5.4.3 ),
suggesting that:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.57)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Let us conclude with a couple of observations about the second phase of
@xmath , for more details we refer the reader to [ 80 ] . It is possible
to show that the two phases of @xmath have different completely refined
Hilbert series for the coherent component of the master space. If we
define the charges for the second phase as in Table 5.3 , with as usual
@xmath , @xmath

we obtain:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with @xmath a polynomial in the fugacities. One can check that the
Hilbert Series for the first phase in 5.4.3 , and the one for the second
phase in 5.4.3 are really different: @xmath and that they become exactly
equal for @xmath , in agreement with our conjecture in chapter 2 :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Moreover the the refined GKZ auxiliary partition functions are also
different. In phase II the GKZ auxiliary partition function is:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.58)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and it is explicitly different from ( 5.4.51 ). The two partition
functions become the same ( 5.4.3 , 5.4.49 ) only for @xmath . The nice
observation is that @xmath for both the two toric phases is decomposable
in terms of the elementary partition functions @xmath ( 5.4.3 ), and the
formula ( 5.4.52 ) holds for both the phases, meaning that @xmath
combined with @xmath of phase I and II reconstruct @xmath for the phase
I and II respectively. All this means that the computation of BPS
operators for @xmath give the same result in the two phases, when
expressed in terms of non anomalous symmetries @xmath , while the
dependence on the anomalous charges @xmath and @xmath is different.
However this agrees with Seiberg duality, because dual operators have
the same non anomalous charges but in general different charges under
anomalous symmetries. It agrees also with the strong coupling gravity
computations, because the anomalous symmetries are not really symmetries
of the theory and are invisible in the dual gravity background.

##### Generating Functions for @xmath

As before the higher @xmath generating function @xmath is given by the
plethystic exponentiation using formula ( 5.2.2 ). We can start from any
decomposition of the @xmath generating function, the GKZ decomposition (
5.4.46 ), the refined GKZ decomposition ( 5.4.52 ) or the expansion in
baryonic charges. Using the GKZ decomposition we have

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

¿From which we can compute the generating function for @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Taking the plethystic logarithm of the generating functions for @xmath ,
it is possible to find the generators of the moduli space. For @xmath
the plethystic logarithm of ( 5.4.41 ) is very simple:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and it correctly reproduces the 8 chiral field generators and the two
relations among them. For @xmath the moduli space is a complete
intersection, and this is reflected by the fact that the plethystic
logarithm has a finite number of terms. In the @xmath case there are 12
baryonic generators and 13 mesonic ones and the moduli space is no more
a complete intersection. By looking at the order of the pole for the
computed generating functions near @xmath , we checked that the
dimension of the moduli space is @xmath as expected.

#### 5.4.4 Counting in @xmath and in @xmath

We can also consider, as was done for the conifold in section 4.7 ,
fictitious theories counting subsets of the BPS chiral operators.

The half @xmath corresponds to considering only the BPS operators
containing @xmath and no occurrences of the other four elementary
fields. This is done by truncating Equation ( 5.4.43 ) for @xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.60)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We easily obtain the generating functions for @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.61)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

Moreover, by generalizing arguments given in section 4.7 for the @xmath
conifold, it is easy to write a formula for generic @xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.62)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which is interpreted as the fact that the ring of invariants is freely
generated by four determinants @xmath and @xmath mesons @xmath with
@xmath . This can be understood easily from the absence of nontrivial F
term conditions and the fact that all baryons factorize into an
elementary determinant times mesons.

The @xmath corresponds to considering only the BPS operators containing
@xmath and @xmath and no occurrences of the other two elementary fields.
This is done by taking

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.63)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Using the same multiplicities as in Equation ( 5.4.46 ) we obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.64)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

### 5.5 The Molien Formula: Checks for @xmath

All along this thesis we have made some consistency checks of the
geometric computations we proposed against a direct field theory
construction. Till now we focused on some particular cases, namely the
abelian @xmath case, some lower dimensional operators in the chiral
ring, and some peculiar field theories with zero superpotential. In this
section we would like to give a general method, valid for every quiver
field theory, for computing generating function for generic @xmath in
the field theory side. The baryonic generating functions found in the
previous sections can indeed be checked against an explicit field theory
computation, at least for small values of @xmath . The method we present
here is the extension of the Molien Invariant formulae discussed in
section 4.7 to the case in which the superpotential is an arbitrary non
trivial functions of the elementary chiral superfields.

The problem of finding invariants under the action of a continuous group
is the hearth of invariant theory and goes back to the nineteenth
century, as most of the concepts necessary for its solution, like
syzygies and free resolutions, all amenable to Hilbert. Modern advances,
such as the discovery of Groebner basis, gave an algorithmic way of
solving such problems and the advent of computer algebra programs made
some computations really doable.

The generating functions for a fixed number of colors @xmath can be
reduced to a problem for polynomial rings as follows. Consider an @xmath
supersymmetric gauge theory with @xmath elementary fields @xmath and a
gauge group @xmath . Since we are discussing the chiral ring we can
replace @xmath with its complexification @xmath . For quiver theories,
the elementary fields consist of @xmath matrices. Consider a polynomial
ring in @xmath variables @xmath made with the entries of these matrices.
The F-terms give matrix relations whose entries are polynomial
equations. We can collect all the polynomial F-term equations in an
ideal @xmath and define the quotient ring

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.65)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The gauge group @xmath and the global symmetry group act naturally on
the ring and we can grade the elements of @xmath with gauge and global
charges. Denoting with @xmath the global Abelian charges and with @xmath
the charges under the Cartan subgroup of the gauge group @xmath , we can
write the generating function, or Hilbert series, of the graded ring
@xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.66)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which can be arranged to be a power series in the global charges @xmath
and a Laurent expansion in the gauge charges @xmath . The full gauge
group @xmath acts on the quotient ring @xmath and, since the gauge
symmetry commutes with the global symmetry, all the elements of @xmath
with given charge @xmath form a (not necessarily irreducible)
representation of @xmath . Therefore, the coefficient of @xmath in
Equation ( 5.5.66 ) is the character of a @xmath representation,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.67)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Here we have denoted with @xmath the irreducible representations of
@xmath and decomposed the representation on the elements of charge
@xmath into irreducible ones. The generating function for invariants is
given by the projection onto the trivial representation with character
@xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.68)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The projection can be easily done by averaging @xmath on the gauge group
with the Weyl measure. The latter has indeed the property to keep only
the contribution of the trivial representation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.69)
  -- -------- -- ----------

For a given group @xmath with rank @xmath we can explicitly write the
measure as a multi-contour integral

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.70)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath are the weights of the adjoint representation and @xmath is
the order of the Weyl group. We finally get the Molien formula:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.71)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This is the generalization of the formula ( 4.7.66 ) to the case in
which the superpotential is non zero. Since the multi-contour integrals
can be evaluated with the residue theorem, the real problem in using
Equation ( 5.5.71 ) is the determination of the integrand, that is the
Hilbert series of the quotient ring @xmath . Fortunately, this is the
kind of problems that modern commutative algebra made algorithmic and
that can be easily solved with computer algebra programs. For example
Macaulay2 naturally deals with polynomial rings and it has a build-in
command hilbertSeries . For moderate values of @xmath , the computation
takes fractions of second, but it can become too hard with a standard
computer already at @xmath and a number of fields @xmath of order 10. In
these cases, one can still truncate the computation at a maximum degree
in t and get a sensible result.

It is worth mentioning that special care has to be taken when the moduli
space is not irreducible and at certain points in moduli space new
branches are opening up. This is the case for example for @xmath
theories that have additional Coulomb branches and was treated in [ 25 ]
. As we saw in chapter 2 the reducibility of the moduli space @xmath is
quite generic and understanding in detail how to compute Hilbert series
on this space is a fundamental task. The general case that we want to
address is the following. Suppose that we have an @xmath F-term equation
where one of the elementary fields can be factorized: @xmath where
@xmath is a polynomial not containing @xmath . Considering the @xmath
moduli space as a fibration over the line parametrized by @xmath , we
see that the dimension of the fiber increases by one unit over @xmath :
indeed, for @xmath we can impose the further constraint @xmath which
reduces by one the dimension of the fiber. This means that a new branch
opens up at @xmath and the full moduli space is reducible. This is for
example the case for @xmath as discussed in chapter 2.4.3 . We may want
to determine the generating function for a given irreducible component
of the moduli space, in particular the closure of the open set @xmath ,
or, for @xmath , of @xmath . This is done with a standard trick. Add a
new element @xmath to the ring and a new equation, @xmath to the ideal
@xmath . Clearly, the new equation prevents @xmath from being zero. The
irreducible component of the moduli space we are interested in is
obtained by projecting the variety defined by the new ideal @xmath on
the space parameterized by the @xmath and taking the closure. This can
be done by eliminating @xmath from the ideal @xmath . This defines the
elimination ideal @xmath that can be computed with the Macaulay2 command
eliminate . If we define

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.72)
  -- -------- -- ----------

we can now proceed as before, compute the Hilbert series of this ring
and project it onto gauge invariants with the Molien formula. This would
give us the generating function for the particular irreducible component
of the moduli space.

We now present some explicit examples based on the conifold and @xmath .
Other cases can be checked similarly, at least for small values of
number of fields, @xmath , and number of D-branes, @xmath . When @xmath
increases it is necessary to truncate the series to a maximum degree.

#### 5.5.1 @xmath for the Conifold

The generating function of the conifold for @xmath was explicitly
computed in section 4.4.1 and is given in Equation ( 4.4.26 ). For
@xmath we have four fields @xmath that are two-by-two matrices, whose
entries we denote by @xmath . The four matrix F-term equations

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

give rises to sixteen polynomial equations for the @xmath which
generates an ideal @xmath in the polynomial ring @xmath . The element
@xmath of the complexified gauge group @xmath acts on the matrices as
@xmath and @xmath . All the entries @xmath and @xmath transform with a
definite charge under the Cartan subgroup

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.5.73)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

We further assign chemical potential @xmath to the eight fields @xmath
and chemical potential @xmath to the eight fields @xmath . The sixteen
F-term constraints generating the ideal @xmath transform homogeneously
under the gauge and global charges. We can thus grade the quotient ring

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.74)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with four charges, corresponding to chemical potentials, two gauge
@xmath and two global @xmath . The Hilbert series of @xmath can be
computed using Macaulay2

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
              
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.5.76)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

The molien formula now reads

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.77)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Some attention should be paid in performing the contour integrals.
Recall that @xmath gives the generating function for the ring @xmath
when expanded in power series in @xmath and in @xmath which are supposed
to be complex numbers of modulus less than one. This should be taken
into account when performing the contour integrals on the unit circles
@xmath . For example, the first contour integration in @xmath takes
contribution only from the residues in the points @xmath lying inside
the unit circle @xmath (we take @xmath ). Similar arguments apply to the
second integration. After performing the two integrals we obtain

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.78)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which perfectly coincides with Equation ( 4.4.26 ).

#### 5.5.2 @xmath and @xmath for @xmath: the Reducibility of the Moduli
Space

We now consider an example where the moduli space is not irreducible. We
consider the @xmath case in order to limit the number of equations
involved. The following discussion can be applied to the other cases of
reducible moduli space as well. For @xmath we consider the polynomial
ring

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.79)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with six variables. There are two F-term equations

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The Hilbert series for this polynomial ring is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.80)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As already discussed, the variety defined by @xmath is not irreducible:
we are interested in the closure of the open set @xmath . We then define
a new ideal by adding two new variables @xmath to @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.81)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and two new generators to the ideal @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The closure of the open set @xmath is obtained by eliminating @xmath and
@xmath . This can be done in a polynomial way by using the Groebner
basis and the algorithm is implemented in Macaulay2 in the command
eliminate . In our case the elimination ideal is just

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the Hilbert series of

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.5.82)
  -- -------- -- ----------

is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which indeed coincides with the @xmath generating function given in
Equation ( 5.4.64 ). The @xmath generating function should be computed
in a similar way. The fields @xmath are now two-by-two matrices, for a
total of @xmath independent entries. The ideal @xmath now contains
@xmath polynomial equations, given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the elimination ideal @xmath is obtained by eliminating @xmath and
@xmath . The Hilbert series of @xmath graded with the gauge charges is a
rational function @xmath whose expression is too long to be reported
here. Four integrations using the residue theorem finally give the
@xmath generating function given in ( 5.4.64 ).

### 5.6 Summary and Discussions

In this chapter we have performed a further step in the understanding
and the computation of the generating functions for the chiral ring of
the superconformal gauge theories living on branes at CY singularities.
We have reinforced the conjecture that the generating functions for
@xmath colors can be computed simply in terms of the @xmath generating
functions through the plethystic program. We tested this conjecture,
suggested by a computation with D3-branes in the dual background, in
field theory for small values of @xmath . It would be interesting to
perform checks for large @xmath as well as to investigate the
statistical properties of the resulting generating functions.

In particular we have made an explicit investigation of the properties
of the complete @xmath generating function and we have compared the
result with a geometrical computation. The emerging structure reveals
once more the deep interplay between the quiver gauge theory and the
algebraic geometry of the CY. We reinforce the relations between the
Kähler moduli space of the CY an the baryonic charges in the field
theory we observed in the previous chapter. Indeed in this chapter we
found an intriguing relation between the decomposition of the @xmath
generating function in sector of given baryonic charge and the
discretized Kähler moduli space of the CY.

The geometrical structure of the complete moduli space for @xmath
colors, which is obtained by the @xmath -fold symmetrized product of the
CY by adding the baryonic directions, is still poorly understood. In
chapter 2 we have seen that already for @xmath the moduli space is rich
and interesting.

In this chapter we have done the nice step forward to give a general
recipe, valid for every singularity @xmath , to compute the generating
function @xmath for arbitrary values of N. In the next chapter we will
apply the techniques we have developed for the finite N counting to the
study of the complete moduli space @xmath for generic values of @xmath .

## Chapter 6 Back to the Moduli Space

Enriched by the discussions of the last three chapters we can now go
back to the problem of studying the moduli space @xmath of SCFT at
singularity @xmath . Now we know how to compute partition functions for
generic @xmath number of branes and we can use the paradigm of algebraic
geometry: an algebraic variety is completely described by its coordinate
ring. Namely if we want to study the moduli space @xmath for a SCFT with
@xmath number of colors, it is enough to study the spectrum of
holomorphic function @xmath over it, or, in a field theory language, the
spectrum of 1/2 BPS operators. We will see that the Hilbert series of
@xmath for generic @xmath contain a lot of interesting informations
about the moduli space @xmath . In particular, using the PE function and
the GKZ decomposition, we would be able to extend the hidden symmetries
we have found in the Master space @xmath for @xmath brane, to the
complete moduli space @xmath for generic number of branes N.

### 6.1 Generalities

In chapter 2 we made an extensive study of the moduli space @xmath of
the gauge theory living on a single D3 brane probing the three-fold
singularity @xmath . We would be definitively interested to obtain as
many informations as possible regarding the moduli space @xmath for
generic number of brane @xmath . This seems in principle a very
difficult problem, if we want to attack it directly as we did in the
case of just one brane. However thanks to the techniques we developed to
study the BPS spectrum of these kind of gauge theories, we will be able
to extract non trivial informations regarding the moduli space @xmath in
a rather indirect way.

In the two following subsections we review what we know about the moduli
space @xmath and the PE function.

#### 6.1.1 The non Abelian Moduli Space

Let us start summarizing what we can say about @xmath looking directly
at the defining equations. The case for an arbitrary number @xmath of
D3-branes is much more subtle and less understood in the mathematical
literature than the @xmath case, even though it is clear from the gauge
theory perspective. We know that the world-volume theory for @xmath
D3-branes is a quiver theory with product @xmath gauge groups and in the
IR, the @xmath factors decouple since only the special unitary groups
exhibit asymptotic freedom and are strongly coupled in the IR. Thus the
moduli space of interest is the space of solutions to the F-flatness,
quotiented out by a non-Abelian gauge group

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the index @xmath recalls that we are dealing with @xmath branes.
The moduli space @xmath is of difficult characterization since the
quotient is fully non-Abelian and it can not be described by toric
methods, as in the @xmath case. This means that passing from @xmath to
@xmath we lose lot of the powerful tolls of toric geometry we have
extensively used in the @xmath case.

The more familiar mesonic moduli space is obtained by performing a
further quotient by the Abelian symmetries. Even for @xmath branes, the
Abelian group will be constituted of the decoupled @xmath factors, and
hence will be the same as in the toric, @xmath case. Once again, we
expect to have some symplectic quotient structure, in analogy with (
2.1.2 ), for this mesonic moduli space:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Hence, a toric symplectic quotient still persists for ( 6.1.2 ), even
though the moduli space in question is not necessarily toric.

Moreover, our plethystic techniques, which we will shortly review, will
illuminate us with much physical intuition. First, the mesonic moduli
space for @xmath branes is the @xmath -th symmetrized product of that of
@xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the symmetric group on @xmath elements. We see that the
mesonic moduli space, for @xmath a Calabi-Yau threefold, is of dimension
@xmath by ( 6.1.3 ). The dimension of the moduli space @xmath is thus
@xmath for general @xmath .

An important observation is that the symmetric product of a toric CY
variety is no more toric and generically non CY. This mesonic moduli
space is the base of the @xmath baryonic fibrations whose total space is
the complete moduli space @xmath . Combining our knowledge on the
complete moduli space for just one brane @xmath and our skill in
counting BPS operators for generic @xmath we will study the properties
of @xmath .

#### 6.1.2 The Plethystic Programme Reviewed

As we have already realized the PE function is a fundamental tool in the
study of general @xmath . Here we review/summarize some essential facts,
that we learnt to appreciate in the previous chapters and that will be
very useful in the present analysis.

The realization in [ 23 , 63 ] is that the mesonic generating function,
with all baryonic numbers fixed to be zero, @xmath , for the
single-trace mesonic operators for D3-branes probing a Calabi-Yau
threefold @xmath at @xmath , is the Hilbert series of @xmath . The
Plethystic Exponential of a multi-variable function @xmath that vanishes
at the origin, @xmath is defined as:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Then the multi-trace mesonic operators at @xmath are counted by the
plethystic exponential

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The inverse, @xmath , is counting objects in the defining equation
(syzygy) of the threefold @xmath . The mesonic multi-trace generating
function @xmath at finite @xmath is found by the series expansion of the
@xmath -inserted plethystic exponential as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In general (chapter 2 ) for the combined mesonic and baryonic branches
of the moduli space ¹ ¹ 1 To be Strict, we should say here the mesonic
branch together with given FI-parameters, since at @xmath , there are no
baryons. Nevertheless, we can still generate the counting for the
baryons for @xmath using PE of the @xmath case. , the @xmath operators
are counted by the Hilbert series of the master space @xmath . The
plethystic program can be efficiently applied to the study of the
coherent component of the moduli space ( chapter 5 ). With the
generating function for the coherent component of the master space,
which we denote @xmath , we can proceed with the plethystic program and
find the result for @xmath , counting the combined baryonic and mesonic
gauge invariant operators at finite @xmath .

As we explained in the previous chapter the implementation of the
plethystic program requires a decomposition of the @xmath generating
function in sectors of definite baryonic charges, to which the
plethystic exponential is applied. There exist an interesting connection
of this decomposition with Kähler moduli. The decomposition of @xmath
requires the knowledge of two sets of partition functions, the
geometrical ones, obtained by localization, and the auxiliary one,
obtained from dimer combinatorics. Specifically, we realized that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the summation is extended over the lattice points @xmath , of
multiplicity @xmath , of the so-called GKZ (or secondary) fan of the
Calabi-Yau threefold and @xmath is a much more manageable object
obtained from a localization computation, as given in Eq ( 5.3.11 ). The
GKZ fan, to remind the reader, is the fan of an auxiliary toric variety,
which is the space of Kähler parameters of the original toric threefold
@xmath . This space is of dimension @xmath , where @xmath is the number
of internal points and @xmath , the number of vertices, of the toric
diagram of @xmath .

The multiplicity @xmath of points in this GKZ lattice fan is counted by
an auxiliary partition function , so-named @xmath . This is simply the
(refined) Hilbert series of the following space: take the simpler quiver
than the original by neglecting any repeated arrows and then form the
space of open but not closed loops in this simplified quiver. The
expansion of @xmath can then be used to compute the generating function
for one D3-brane.

As a brief reminder to the reader, the procedure to determine the
refined generating function @xmath in ( 6.1.7 ) is to (1) obtain the
generating function @xmath in terms of a set of Kähler parameters @xmath
using the localisation formula ( 5.3.11 ); (2) obtain @xmath as above,
and (3) replace a term @xmath in @xmath by an expression for @xmath .
The important point for our ensuing discussions is that the plethystic
program can be applied to the @xmath partition functions at each point
of the GKZ fan in order to obtain the finite @xmath generating function

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The organization of the rest of the chapter is as follows. In section
6.2 we introduce and elaborate on the remarkable feature of “hidden
symmetries” of gauge theories from D3 branes at singularities. In
chapter 2 we have already seen that the coherent component @xmath of the
master space for one brane has generically some hidden symmetries not
manifest in the UV Lagrangian describing the field theory. In this
section we will see that the symmetries of @xmath can manifest
themselves as hidden global symmetries of the gauge theory, and indeed
they can sometime be promoted to symmetries of the complete moduli space
@xmath for generic value of N. We examine how such symmetries
beautifully exhibit themselves in the plethystics of the Hilbert series
of the master space by explicitly arranging themselves into
representations of the associated Lie algebra. In sections 6.3 and 6.4
we describe in details how to study the moduli space of gauge theories
for generic N in the @xmath and @xmath examples respectively.

### 6.2 Hidden Global Symmetries

In chapter 2 we realized that the master space @xmath of gauge theories
at singularities @xmath , in the case @xmath , has generically more
symmetries than the Lagrangian describing UV field theory. A natural
question is: is it an accident of the @xmath case or it propagates to
generic N ? May we learn something about the moduli space for generic
@xmath looking at the symmetries of the N=1 moduli space ? Or in the
language of the chapter 2 : Is it possible that the master space @xmath
contains important informations regarding the complete moduli space
@xmath ? In the rest of this chapter we will try to give an affirmative
answer to these questions.

All along the history, the physics made huge progress looking to the
symmetries of our world. Indeed the idea will move our following studies
will be: SYMMETRIES. The moduli space of a field theory may possess
symmetries beyond gauge symmetry or reparametrisation. Searching for
hidden symmetries of a given supersymmetric field theory often leads to
insight of the structure of the theory. For D-brane quiver theories, an
underlying symmetry is ever-present: the symmetry of the Calabi-Yau
space @xmath is visible in the UV as a global flavor symmetry in the
Lagrangian, while the symmetry of the full moduli space @xmath can
reveal a new hidden global symmetry which develops as the theory flows
to the IR.

In particular, in [ 49 ] , the basic fields of the quiver for @xmath
theories were reordered into multiplets of a proposed @xmath symmetry
and consequently the superpotential terms into singlets of this
symmetry. The exceptional Lie group @xmath acts geometrically on the
divisors of the del Pezzo surfaces and is realized in the quantum field
theory as a hidden symmetry enhancing the @xmath non-anomalous baryonic
@xmath ’s of the @xmath quiver.

Do the symmetries of the master space, whose geometrical significance we
have learned to appreciate in the foregoing discussions, manifest
themselves in the full moduli space @xmath of the gauge theory? Phrased
another way, do these symmetries survive the symplectic quotient of (
2.1.1 ) and manifest themselves also at finite @xmath ? This is
indubitably a natural question.

In this section, equipped with the new notion of the master space we can
revisit this problem and recast all operators into irreducible
representations of the symmetry of @xmath . We will show that these
symmetries are encoded in a subtle and beautiful way by the fundamental
invariant of the plethystic programme for @xmath : the Hilbert series.
Moreover, we will demonstrate in some examples how the hidden symmetries
of the moduli space come from enhancing anomalous and non-anomalous
Abelian symmetries of the Lagrangian describing the UV field theory.

Since we will always deal with the coherent component of the moduli
space in the following and there is no source for ambiguity, we will
adopt a simplified notation for the Hilbert series:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

#### 6.2.1 Character Expansion: a Warm-up with @xmath

The @xmath supersymmetric gauge theory does not have a baryonic branch
and therefore the master space @xmath coincides with the Calabi-Yau
manifold @xmath . We therefore do not expect any new symmetries but
instead can use this example as a warm-up example for expanding in terms
of characters of the global symmetry. For a single D3-brane, @xmath and
there is a @xmath symmetry. Now, there is an @xmath symmetry for which
@xmath is a maximal subgroup, however, we shall see below that the
slightly smaller @xmath suffices to keep the structure of the BPS
operators.

The generating function for @xmath is well known and was computed in
various places (cf. e.g. [ 23 , 63 ] ). It takes the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which coincides with the grand canonical partition function of the three
dimensional harmonic oscillator. This form is perhaps the simplest one
can write down for the exact answer and from this extract the generating
function for any fixed @xmath . In this subsection, we will rewrite it
in terms of characters of the @xmath global symmetry. The expansion
demonstrates how one can explicitly represent this function in terms of
characters. This will help in analyzing the next few examples in which
expansion in terms of characters are done but for more complicated
cases.

Equation ( 6.2.2 ) admits a plethystic exponential form,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We recall that @xmath , the generating function for a single D3-brane,
@xmath , is none other than the refined Hilbert series for @xmath ,
itself being the @xmath of the defining equations (syzygies) for @xmath
, here just the 3 variables. Furthermore, @xmath encodes all the
generators for the multi-trace operators (symmetric product) at general
number @xmath of D-branes.

We can now introduce @xmath weights @xmath which reflect the fact that
the chemical potentials @xmath are in the fundamental representation of
@xmath , and a chemical potential @xmath for the @xmath charge,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We can define the character of the fundamental representation with the
symbol

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The second equality follows from the basic property of the plethystic
exponential which produces all possible symmetric products of the
function on which it acts. The full generating function is now rewritten
as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

giving an explicit representation as characters of @xmath . This
equation is very important, and shows explicitly that the complete
spectrum of BPS operators for the @xmath theory, for generic @xmath ,
reorganize in representation of @xmath . H ence the complete moduli
space @xmath has at least an @xmath symmetry. This is clearly an
observation that is expected and can be obtained in many other ways, but
a similar fact will be rather non trivial for other singularity @xmath :
If the Hilbert series for generic N can be explicitly written in term of
character of certain group G, than the moduli space @xmath for generic N
will have the group G as symmetry group.

We can expand @xmath and find, for example,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Alternatively we can write down an explicit power expansion for @xmath
as

  -- -- -- ---------
           (6.2.9)
  -- -- -- ---------

Note that @xmath is not palindromic, indicating that the moduli space of
2 D-branes on @xmath , as expected, is not Calabi-Yau. Armed with this
character expansion let us now turn to more involved cases where there
is a baryonic branch.

#### 6.2.2 Conifold Revisited

Having warmed up with @xmath , let us begin with our most familiar
example, the conifold @xmath . In chapter 2 we learnt that the master
space for the conifold is simply @xmath . The symmetry of this space is
@xmath where the @xmath is the R-symmetry while the @xmath symmetry is
not visible at the level of the Lagrangian and therefore will be called
“hidden”. One should stress that at the IR the two @xmath gauge fields
become free and decouple and one is left with 4 non-interacting fields,
which obviously transform as fundamental representation of this @xmath
global symmetry. Now, there is a mesonic @xmath symmetry and a baryonic
@xmath symmetry, this @xmath Hidden Symmetry is an enhancement of both.
In section 4.3 we learnt how to assign the UV @xmath global symmetry
charges to the @xmath and @xmath fields that are the coordinates of the
master space @xmath . We obtained indeed the N=1 generating function:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In the above, we recall from section 6.1.2 that the Hilbert series is
itself the PE of the defining equations.

Now, the fields @xmath and @xmath are in the representations of the
explicit @xmath symmetry, while our hidden symmetry is @xmath . We will
therefore introduce @xmath weights, @xmath and map them to the three
weights of the @xmath global symmetry. This is done simply by first
taking the four weights of the fundamental representation of @xmath ,
whose character we will denote as @xmath , and which we recall can be
written in terms of the weights as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Then we multiply by @xmath to obtain a @xmath representation, which
should be mapped them to the four weights of @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In analogy with ( 6.2.3 ), we can now write ( 6.2.10 ) in terms of a
plethystic exponential:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the completely symmetric tensor of rank @xmath and
dimension @xmath . The first equality writes the 4 generators of @xmath
, viz., @xmath , in the weights of @xmath and the second equality
follows from the definition of @xmath in ( 6.1.4 ) and the fact that
expansion of the plethystic exponential in power series of @xmath will
compose the @xmath -th symmetrized product. Equation ( 6.2.13 ) is a
trivial and obvious demonstration that the @xmath generating function is
decomposed into irreducible representations of @xmath , precisely one
copy of the irreducible representation @xmath at R-charge @xmath . To be
precise we are taking here the R-charge to be @xmath times that of the
basic field @xmath .

##### Hidden Symmetries for Higher Plethystics

We have now seen that the basic invariant, i.e., @xmath , the Hilbert
series, of @xmath , can be written explicitly as the plethystic
exponential of the fundamental representation of @xmath . Now, the
hidden symmetry mixes baryon number with meson number and therefore we
do not expect this symmetry to hold for general number @xmath of
D3-branes. For the case of @xmath , however, baryons and mesons have the
same R-charge and therefore we may expect the global symmetry to be
enhanced.

Actually for @xmath , @xmath becomes a symmetry of the Lagrangian of the
conifold theory, which is an @xmath theory with four flavors in the
vector representation and an @xmath invariant superpotential. Writing
the 4 flavors in the vector representation of @xmath as a @xmath matrix
@xmath we find that the superpotential is @xmath . Using the formalism
which we developed to count gauge invariant operators for the conifold
we find that the @xmath generating function does indeed decompose into
characters of irreducible representations of @xmath .

The generating function for @xmath was computed in section 4.4 . This
generating function could be given as a function of all 4 chemical
potentials and is quite lengthy. Here, we will take this expression and
recast it into characters of the global symmetry @xmath . The first
point to note is that the generators form the @xmath representation of
@xmath . It is natural to expect this since this representation is the
second rank symmetric product of the generators for @xmath . The other
terms are less obvious and need explicit computation. A short
computation yields

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This can be seen if we write the explicit expressions for the characters
of the irreducible representations of @xmath which we can write in terms
of the weights as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As a check, ( 6.2.14 ) can be expanded to first few orders in @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and in series form it is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Now, using the formula for the dimension of a generic irreducible
representation of @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

we find that the unrefined generating function for @xmath sums to

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.2.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

as expected and in agreement with the Equations in section 4.4 . Taking
the Plethystic Logarithm we find that the 7 dimensional manifold is
generated by 10 operators of order 2 transforming in the @xmath
representation of @xmath subject to 10 cubic relations transforming in
the @xmath representation of @xmath . Since @xmath is not palindromic we
expect the moduli space of 2 D-branes on the conifold to be not
Calabi-Yau.

This confirms the expansion in terms of characters of @xmath for the
case of @xmath . Unfortunately this symmetry does not extend to @xmath
and is not a symmetry for higher values of @xmath .

In the next example we are going to see how a hidden symmetry extends to
all values of @xmath , simply because the hidden symmetry does not mix
baryonic numbers with mesonic numbers as it does for the conifold. The
symmetry structure then persists to all orders in @xmath .

### 6.3 @xmath Revisited

The master space for @xmath is calculated above in section 2.3 and is
found to be irreducible. Its symplectic quotient description is @xmath .
We note that the sum of charges is zero, implying that this
5-dimensional variety is Calabi-Yau, in agreement with ( 2.2.9 ). This
space is a natural generalization of the conifold and has the
description of a cone over a 9 real dimensional Sasaki Einstein manifold
given by a circle bundle over @xmath . This structure reveals a symmetry
of the form @xmath .

Indeed, we note that this construction is toric and therefore we would
expect a symmetry which is at least @xmath since the master space has
dimension 5. However, due to the special symmetries of this space the
symmetry is larger. The @xmath is the R-symmetry and the first @xmath is
the natural one acting on the mesonic moduli space @xmath . The second
@xmath symmetry is a “hidden” symmetry, and is related to the two
anomalous baryonic @xmath symmetries that play a rôle as the Cartan
subgroup of this symmetry. We can use the full symmetry to compute the
refined Hilbert series for this space.

The Hilbert series for just one charge was computed with the Molien
formula in ( 2.3.30 )

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Taking the plethystic logarithm of this expression we find 9 generators
at order @xmath subject to 9 relations at order @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This agrees exactly with the content of ( 2.2.9 ) which says that @xmath
should be the incomplete (since the plethystic logarithm does not
terminate) intersection of 9 quadrics in 9 variables.

Now, we would like to refine the Hilbert series to include all the 5
global charges. This can be done using the Molien formula or any other
of the methods discussed in section 2.3 . Here we find a shorter way of
determining it. To do this we recognize the 9 quiver fields as
transforming in the @xmath representation of @xmath . For short we will
write an irreducible representation of this group as a collection of 4
non-negative integer numbers, here @xmath and with obvious extension to
other representations. These are all the generators of the variety (
2.3.29 ). The relations are derived from a superpotential of weight
@xmath so we expect 9 relations at order @xmath transforming in the
conjugate representation to the generators, @xmath . To get this into
effect we rewrite ( 6.3.19 ) into a form which allows generalization to
include characters (multiplying top and bottom by @xmath ):

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The coefficient of the @xmath in the numerator can now be identified
with the 9 relations, whose transformation rules are already determined
to be @xmath . Being irreducible we expect the Hilbert series to be
palindromic. This gives as the @xmath term as @xmath . The same property
implies that the coefficient of the @xmath term is self conjugate and
hence uniquely becomes the adjoint representation for @xmath , @xmath .
Finally, the denominator can be simply expressed as a plethystic
exponential of the representation for the generators, @xmath . In other
words, @xmath . In summary, we end up with the refinement of the Hilbert
series for @xmath as:

  -- -- -------- -------- --
                 @xmath   
        @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -- -------- -------- --

For completeness, we list here the explicit expressions for the
characters of the representations, using weights @xmath for the first,
mesonic @xmath and @xmath for the second, hidden @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In terms of the above weights, being generated by the representation
@xmath , the Hilbert series, ( 6.3 ), for the case of @xmath D3-brane
admits a simple and natural series expansion of the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

##### Higher Number of Branes

Using the formalism of the chapter 5 and summarized in section 6.1.2 ,
we can compute the @xmath generating function in terms of characters of
the global symmetry. The computation is somewhat lengthy but the result
is relatively simple:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with coefficient 1 for each representation which appears in the
expansion. It is important to identify the generators of this expression
and a quick computation reveals the order @xmath and order @xmath
generators to be the representations, @xmath , and @xmath ,
respectively. We can therefore sum the series and obtain

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is a complicated polynomial of order 58 in @xmath which has
the first 10 terms:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Similarly, we can obtain generic expressions for any @xmath . Recall
from section 5.4.2 that the generating function for a fixed integral
Kähler modulus @xmath is equal to

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.28)
  -- -------- -- ----------

this can be easily written in terms of representations of the global
symmetry as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The auxiliary partition function also admits an expression in terms of
representations of the global symmetry:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.30)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which has an expansion as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.31)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Following chapter 5 or the recipe we gave in section 6.1.2 , we can use
can use ( 6.3.29 ) and ( 6.3.31 ) to compute the generating function for
one D3-brane:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.32)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In the second equality we shifted the index @xmath by 3 and an opposite
shift of the index @xmath by 1 in the second term. This allows us, in
the third equality, to cancel all terms for @xmath except for the term
in @xmath . Thus we reproduce ( 6.3.24 ) in a remarkable cancellation
that leaves only positive coefficients.

Subsequently, we can obtain the expression @xmath , by computing the
@xmath -inserted plethystic exponential and series expansion:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.33)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Note that the first @xmath contains all the terms in the second @xmath
and hence all the coefficients in the expansion are positive. As a
check, we can expand ( 6.3.33 ) to second order in @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.34)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which indeed agrees with ( 6.3.25 ).

Equation ( 6.3.33 ) is extremely important: it shows that all the BPS
operators of the gauge theory for @xmath , for every value of N,
reorganize in representations of the @xmath group, where the second
@xmath factor is an hidden symmetry, namely it is not visible in the UV
Lagrangian describing the gauge theory. Because the BPS operators of the
gauge theory are the holomorphic functions of the moduli space @xmath ,
this result imply that the moduli space @xmath , for every values of N,
has the symmetry @xmath . This is a very interesting result that come
from the counting of chiral operators !

Because the symmetry @xmath persists for all the values of N, we can
interpolate this result till @xmath . In this way we could make the
prediction that the dual type IIB string on the @xmath background has a
sector in which there exist an hidden @xmath symmetry. This is just a
first guess and we clearly need much more studies.

### 6.4 @xmath Revisited

Let us move on to the @xmath theory and focus on the first toric phase,
whose master space we studied in section 2.4.3 , to see another clear
example of the extension of the symmetries of the coherent component of
the master space @xmath to the the complete moduli space @xmath and to
the complete chiral ring of the theory for every value of N.

We recall that the master space for a single D3-brane, @xmath , is a six
dimensional reducible variety composed by a set of coordinate planes and
an irreducible six dimensional Calabi-Yau piece. This top piece, being
toric, admits a symmetry group which is at least @xmath . Re-examining (
2.4.51 ) we see that it is actually the set product of two three
dimensional conifold singularities:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.35)
  -- -------- -- ----------

hence the group of symmetries is @xmath , twice the isometry group of
the conifold. The first @xmath is the non-Abelian symmetry group of the
variety @xmath , and the second @xmath is a hidden symmetry related to
the two anomalous baryonic symmetries of the gauge theory. The chiral
spectrum of the theory is summarized by the Hilbert series:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.36)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the chemical potential @xmath counts the fields @xmath , @xmath
while @xmath counts the fields @xmath , @xmath .

Let us define the representation @xmath for the @xmath group. Equation (
6.4.35 ) and Table ( 5.2 ) then implies that @xmath are in the @xmath
representation and @xmath are in the @xmath representation. The
refinement for the Hilbert series ( 6.4.36 ) is then

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.37)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Amazingly, the group @xmath is the symmetry for the chiral ring for
generic @xmath , not just for @xmath , and hence the moduli space of the
non-Abelian theory on @xmath D3-branes has this group as a symmetry
group.

The generating function for finite @xmath can be computed using the
plethystic exponential in each sector of the GKZ decomposition of the
@xmath partition function. The procedure is explained in chapter 5 and
summarized in section 6.1.2 . In particular, the implementation of the
plethystic program goes through the formulae ( 6.1.7 ) and ( 6.1.8 ) and
requires the computation of the generating functions for fixed Kähler
moduli and the auxiliary partition function.

Recall from equation ( 5.4.43 ) that the generating function for fixed
integral Kähler moduli, which in this case can be parameterized by two
integers @xmath , @xmath , is equal to

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.38)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This can be easily refined in terms of representations of the global
symmetry as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.39)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The auxiliary partition function in equation ( 5.4.51 ) also admits an
expression in terms of representations of the global symmetry,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.40)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which has an expansion as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.41)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Recalling from section 6.1.2 , once we have @xmath and @xmath we can do
the replacement @xmath in @xmath by @xmath (as done in line 2 below and
using the fact that by our definition @xmath ) to obtain the generating
function for a single brane:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.42)
  -- -------- -- ----------

leaving only positive coefficients and meaning that @xmath is indeed a
symmetry of the @xmath moduli space. The second equality follows by
shifting @xmath by @xmath and the @xmath ’s by @xmath . The third
equality is the remaining @xmath term from both contributions. It is
important to note that Equation ( 6.4.42 ) factorizes into two conifold
generating functions,

  -- -- -- ----------
           (6.4.43)
  -- -- -- ----------

which can be easily checked to equal Equation ( 6.4.37 ).

Next, using ( 6.1.8 ), we can write a generic expression for any @xmath
.

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.44)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Note that the first @xmath contains all the terms in the second @xmath
and hence all the coefficients in the expansion are positive. This is
the explicit demonstration that for generic @xmath the chiral spectrum
organizes into representations of @xmath and hence the moduli space of
the non-Abelian theory with generic rank @xmath has symmetry @xmath . As
in the previous section we could infer that type IIB string propagating
on the back ground @xmath times the circle bundle over @xmath has a
sector in which there exist an hidden symmetry @xmath .It would be nice
to study this phenomenon.

### 6.5 Summary and Discussions

In this chapter we tried to study the non abelian moduli space of brane
at singularity using the properties of the chiral spectra of the gauge
theory. The situation for general number @xmath of D3-branes is much
more subtle than the @xmath case. The moduli space is now the variety of
F-flatness quotiented by the special unitary factors of the gauge group,
so that when quotiented by the @xmath factors as a symplectic quotient
we once more arrive at the mesonic branch, which here is the @xmath -th
symmeterized product of the Calabi-Yau space @xmath . In the fully non
abelian case we lose the toricity properties and a direct attack to the
moduli space seems quite complicated. However, the plethystic programme
persists through and we can still readily extract the generating
functions for any @xmath . The crucial observation was that the gauge
theory possesses, at least in the @xmath case, hidden global symmetries
corresponding to the symmetry of @xmath which, though not manifest in
the Lagrangian, is surprisingly encoded in the algebraic geometry of
@xmath . In particular, we can re-write the terms of the single brane
generating funct! ion, i.e., the refined Hilbert series of @xmath , in
the weights of the representations of the Lie algebra of the hidden
symmetry in a selected set of examples. Using the plethystic programme
we were able to extend this analysis to an arbitrary number @xmath of
branes. Indeed we showed that, for a selected set of examples, we are
still able to reorganize the generating function for generic @xmath in
representation of the hidden symmetries. This fact allowed us to study
the symmetry of the moduli space @xmath . In some cases the symmetries
of @xmath become symmetries of the complete moduli space @xmath and of
the complete chiral ring for generic @xmath . This fact gives us the
possibility to make some predictions about the symmetry of the dual type
IIB string on the @xmath background.

We are at the portal to a vast subject. The algebraic geometry of the
master space at @xmath number of branes deserves a detailed study as we
have done for the single-brane example; we have given its form on
physical grounds and mathematically the structure is expected to be
complicated.

A very important observation is that our systematic analysis should
apply to not only D-brane theories but to supersymmetric gauge theories
in general; the master space and its associated physical insight need to
be thus investigated panoramically. The full symphony based on our motif
in @xmath awaits to be composed.

## Chapter 7 Counting the Fermionic Operators

In the previous chapters we discussed properties of the moduli space of
quiver gauge theories and of their BPS spectrum just looking to the
bosonic degrees of freedom. A generic gauge theory contains in its BPS
spectrum also spinorial degrees of freedom. These are the gauge
invariant operators containing the superfield @xmath . In this chapter
we discuss a general procedure to obtain @xmath @xmath partition
functions for generic @xmath quiver gauge theories counting the gauge
invariant operators (bosonic and fermionic), charged under all the
global symmetries (mesonic and baryonic), in the chiral ring of a given
quiver gauge theory. In particular we will explain the general recipe to
include the fermionic degrees of freedom @xmath in the previously
discussed bosonic partition functions.

### 7.1 Generalities

In the previous chapter we constructed a character associated to the
quiver @xmath at the singularity @xmath that counts the elements in the
chiral ring of the theory according to their charges under the various
@xmath factors of the global symmetry group.

The counting procedure consists in the definition of a set of chemical
potentials @xmath , @xmath associated to each @xmath factor in the group
@xmath (the abelian torus of the global symmetry group of the theory).
We can decompose the @xmath abelian symmetries in @xmath . A @xmath
comes from the isometries of @xmath ( flavour symmetries in CFT
including the R symmetry), @xmath in the toric case, while @xmath comes
from the topology of H ( the baryonic symmetries in the field theory),
in the toric case @xmath where d is the number of external points in the
toric diagram. Once we have defined these chemical potentials we
construct the character @xmath , such that once expanded for small
values of the @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

give us the positive integer coefficients @xmath that tell how many
independent gauge invariant operators there are in the chiral ring with
that specific set of quantum numbers. As we have explained in the
previous chapters this enumeration problem turns out to be a very
powerful toll for the study of the properties of the @xmath and the dual
@xmath geometry [ 28 , 27 , 23 , 24 , 22 , 63 , 85 , 86 , 87 , 88 , 89 ,
97 , 25 , 106 ] . The function @xmath contains the informations
regarding the algebraic equations of the moduli space of the field
theory, its dimension, the volume of the horizon manifold @xmath and
hence the value of the central charge @xmath of the @xmath , the volumes
of all the non trivial three cycles inside @xmath and hence of all the
@xmath charges of the chiral fields in the field theory and the behavior
of the @xmath spectrum under the non perturbative quantum corrections in
the strong coupling regime.

It turned out that all the geometric informations are encoded in the
scalar part of the chiral ring, and indeed till now we just focused on
this part of the spectrum.

The task of this chapter is to make a step further and to study the
generating functions for the complete chiral ring of generic quiver
gauge theories containing all the scalar degrees of freedom plus the
spinorial degrees of freedom originated by the @xmath Weyl spinor
superfields associated to the @xmath vector multiplets.

The complete generating function for the chiral ring of a given quiver
gauge theory gives informations about the complete @xmath @xmath
spectrum, and hence the possibility of a statistical studies of the
thermodynamical properties of a generic strongly coupled @xmath .

We will show how it is possible to obtain the generating functions for
the complete chiral ring starting from the generating functions for the
scalar part. This counting procedure is divided into two parts: the
@xmath counting, and the generic finite @xmath counting. As usual it
happens that the knowledge of the @xmath generating function is enough
to implement the finite @xmath counting. We will indeed introduce a
“superfield formalism” that allows to pass from the @xmath scalar
generating function to the @xmath complete one. In the chiral ring there
are both bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. Indeed the
bifoundamental fields are scalar superfields and hence bosons, while the
superfiels @xmath are Weyl spinors and hence fermions. This different
statistical behavior became important in the finite @xmath counting. For
this reason we will introduce the notion of Generalized Plethystic
Exponential @xmath ¹ ¹ 1 In this chapter we will use the symbol @xmath
for the generalized plethystic exponential, while we will use @xmath for
the bosonic part of the spectrum ( this is what we have till know simply
called the PE function), and @xmath for the fermionic part. . This is a
simple mathematical function that implement the mixed statistic of a
system of bosons and fermions. Once we have obtained the generating
function @xmath for @xmath , to have the generating function @xmath
counting the chiral ring operators for finite values of @xmath we just
need to plug @xmath in the Generalized Plethystic Exponential ² ² 2 This
is just a schematic expression. The more precise equations will be given
in following sections. :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the @xmath , @xmath are for bosonic and fermionic statistic
respectively; @xmath is the bosonic part of the @xmath generating
function, while @xmath is the fermionic part of the @xmath generating
function. The function @xmath is the usual @xmath -inserted plethystic
exponential we used all along this thesis, while the @xmath is its
fermionic version to be defined in the following.

In the previous chapters we developed powerful tools to compute the
@xmath scalar generating functions and the finite @xmath complete
generating functions is simply obtained using the algorithmic procedure
previously explained.

In this chapter we will just shortly comment on this possible extension
of the techniques developed in the rest of the thesis to reach the
complete counting of the chiral ring of quiver CFT. A more careful
analysis is left for the future and the reader can find some more
insights in [ 29 ] .

The chapter is organized in the following way. In section 7.2 we will
start with the simplest example of the @xmath gauge theory. We will
construct the various generating functions looking directly at the
chiral ring structure. This is a simple and explicit example to take in
mind in the next more abstract section. In section 7.3 we will give a
general discussion of the structure of the chiral ring of quiver gauge
theories. We will introduce the concept of generalized @xmath and we
will explain how to compute the generating functions for the complete
chiral ring in the case @xmath and in the generic finite @xmath case. In
section 7.4 , we will revisit, using the general tools introduced in
section 7.3 , the computation of the generating functions for the @xmath
gauge theory. In section 7.5 we will introduce our main example: the
conifold gauge theory. We will construct the @xmath and finite @xmath
generating functions for the mesonic sector of the chiral ring, for the
sector with baryonic charge @xmath , and finally for the complete chiral
ring with all the charges and all the chiral fields.

### 7.2 The @xmath Generating Functions

Let us start with the easy explanatory example of the @xmath , @xmath
gauge theory. In this theory the basic chiral operators are the three
scalars superfields:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and the spinor superfiels:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

¿From the relation in the chiral ring we have:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Because the fields @xmath are bosons while the fields @xmath are
fermions, the first will be represented by commuting variables while the
latter by anti commuting variables. ¿From the super potential we have
the other relations:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We would like to write down a generating function counting all the
single trace operators in the chiral ring of the @xmath gauge theory.

This is easy to obtain if we remember that the generic @xmath @xmath
single trace operators are given by:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Let us introduce the chemical potential @xmath for the dimension of the
fields:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

the chemical potential @xmath for the fields @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.2.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and the chemical potential @xmath for the spin of the chiral fields:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.2.10)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

Hence the operators in ( 7.2.7 ) will be counted by the following
generating functions ³ ³ 3 we will put the subscript @xmath to the
generating functions because it can be shown that for the mesonic part
of undeformed quiver gauge theories the generating functions for the
multi traces, and hence of the complete spectrum of gauge invariant
operators, in the case @xmath are the same as the generating functions
for the single traces in the limit @xmath [ 23 ] . :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
                 
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
                 
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.2.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Hence the complete generating function counting all the single trace
operators ( 7.2.7 ) is:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.2.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Till this moment we just counted in the limit @xmath and in the single
trace sector i.e. without taking into account the relations among gauge
invariants coming from the fact that for finite @xmath one can rewrite
some of the operators in terms other operators with lower dimensions.

To understand the finite @xmath counting we can look to equations (
7.2.5 ), ( 7.2.6 ). These ones tell that one can diagonalize at the same
time all the @xmath and all the @xmath . Hence we are left with a system
of @xmath bosonic eigenvalues and @xmath fermionic eigenvalues. Using
the Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistic we can write down the
function @xmath that generate the partition functions @xmath with fixed
@xmath counting all the @xmath gauge invariant operators (single and
multi traces) [ 86 ] :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In the next section we will discuss how to construct in general the
generating functions for the chiral ring of a given quiver gauge theory.
After this we will revisit the @xmath case.

### 7.3 The General Approach to the Complete Generating Functions

Let us try to motivate our approach to the complete partition function
for the chiral ring of a given gauge theory. We consider gauge theories
describing the low energy dynamics of D3 branes at the CY conical
singularity @xmath . These theories have a set of flavor symmetries (we
include in this class also the always present @xmath symmetry): @xmath ,
@xmath in the toric case; and a set of non anomalous baryonic symmetries
@xmath , @xmath in the toric case. We would like to write down a
generating function counting all the operators in the chiral ring
according to their charges under the global symmetries of the theory.
From the computation of the generating functions in the scalar chiral
ring, explained in the previous chapters, we know that the knowledge of
the generating function for a single D3 brane is enough to compute the
generating functions for an arbitrary number @xmath of @xmath branes ⁴ ⁴
4 this is due to the fact that the gauge invariant operators for fixed
@xmath are nothing else that the @xmath times symmetric product of the
ones for @xmath . The last ones are indeed obtained by the former using
some combinatorial tools. For this reason one has a well defined notion
of single particle Hilbert space ( @xmath ) and multi particle Hilbert
spaces ( @xmath ), that we will use in the following.

A generic quiver gauge theory has the following set of chiral fields:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.3.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

these ones are scalar bifundamental superfields transforming in the
fundamental of the @xmath gauge group and in the anti fundamental of the
@xmath gauge group. The @xmath label the number of fields between the
@xmath -th gauge group and the @xmath -th gauge group;

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.3.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

these ones are the Weyl spinor superfields associated to the vector
supermultiplet of the @xmath gauge group; @xmath label the spin state
and the label @xmath goes over all the @xmath gauge groups @xmath .

In the chiral ring they must satisfy the ‘‘symmetry’’ relations ⁵ ⁵ 5
see for example [ 107 ] :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.3.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and the dynamical relations:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.3.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Where @xmath is the superpotential of the theory under consideration.

The gauge invariant operators constructed with scalar fields @xmath
define a complex ambient space. The dynamical equations ( 7.3.17 )
define an algebraic variety in this space and hence they give
constraints inside the chiral ring that are usually hard to deal with.
In the previous chapters we have explained how to deal with the problem
of counting the scalar part of the chiral ring and how to implement the
constraints ( 7.3.17 ) in the counting procedure. What we want to show
here is how, starting from the knowledge of the scalar partition
function, one can write down the complete @xmath @xmath partition
function for a generic quiver gauge theory.
The generic gauge invariant operator inside the chiral ring will be
constructed in the following way: given a pair of gauge groups @xmath ,
we call a gauge invariant of type @xmath a gauge invariant of the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.3.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath denotes a string of elementary chiral fields @xmath ,
@xmath with all gauge indices contracted except two indices, @xmath and
@xmath , corresponding to the gauge groups @xmath . The index @xmath
runs over all possible strings of elementary fields with these
properties. The full set of gauge invariant operators is obtained by
arbitrary products of the operators in ( 7.3.18 ). Using the tensor
relation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

some of these products of determinants are equivalent and some of these
are actually equivalent to mesonic operators made only with traces.

From the first equation in ( 7.3 ) it is easy to understand that the
fields @xmath are the fermionic degrees of freedom of the theory, and
they can appear in the chiral operator @xmath alone or at most in couple
in the antisymmetric combination: @xmath . The second equation in ( 7.3
) tells that the position of the @xmath spinor fields inside the chiral
string @xmath does not matter. From now on we will call the “single
particle Hilbert space” the space spanned by the operators @xmath . This
space is the total space of the gauge invariant operators in the case
@xmath .

Once we know the spectrum of the operators inside the scalar chiral ring
of the single particle Hilbert space (i.e. all the @xmath that does not
contain the @xmath field), the generic operators come in classes: there
are the ones of the scalar chiral ring, the same ones with the insertion
of one field @xmath , and the same ones of the scalar chiral ring with
the insertion of the antisymmetric combination @xmath . Thanks to the
“commutativity” properties of the fields @xmath and @xmath ( 7.3 ), we
do not have to specify the gauge groups @xmath the @xmath fields belong
to. It is enough to pick up a representative @xmath for all the gauge
groups. The result of this operation is that we would be able to easily
write down the complete partition function for the @xmath @xmath states
of a given @xmath quiver gauge theory with gauge group given by a
product of @xmath factors, times a diagonal overall @xmath factor. The
latter comes from the operators that factorize in products of the type
Tr @xmath . Even if it is possible to obtain the “pure @xmath ”
counting, it is more natural to continue keeping the overall @xmath
factor, and we will indeed continue in this way in the following.

To every operators @xmath we can associate a state in the single
particle Hilbert space. The single particle space of the complete chiral
ring would be spanned by the states:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.3.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath are the charges under the @xmath abelian torus inside the
generically non abelian global flavor group of the gauge theory, @xmath
are the charges under the @xmath baryonic symmetry of the theory, and
@xmath label the statistic of the state.

Now that we have understood the structure of the chiral ring we can
divide the generic one particle state ( 7.3.19 ) in three classes
according to the number of @xmath fields.

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      
                 
     @xmath      (7.3.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the first and the third state are bosonic states ( @xmath ), while
the second one is fermionic ( @xmath ), the subscripts @xmath label the
presence of @xmath fields, and the second subscript label the number of
particle @xmath , in this case ( single particle ) @xmath .

Let us now pass to the generic @xmath case and hence to the multi
particle Hilbert space. Thanks to the division ( 7.3 ) the Fock space of
the chiral ring ( @xmath . @xmath .) will be divided into three parts:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.3.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the three factors on the right hand side are the Fock spaces
associated to the one particle Hilbert spaces definite in ( 7.3 ):

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.3.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the @xmath means the Fock space of a symmetrized tensor product of
the single particle states, while the @xmath means the Fock space of an
anti symmetrized tensor product of the single particle states. The
chiral ring Fock space decomposes in the following way:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.3.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This means that we have to deal with a multi particle space that is
composed by bosons and fermions. If we want to count the operators at
finite @xmath we must introduce mathematical functions that implement
the bosonic and the fermionic statistic.

Let us define the one particle generating function:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.3.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

counting @xmath operators according for example to their dimension: the
integer numbers @xmath tells us how many operators we have with
dimension @xmath .

For the finite @xmath counting we have to implement the right statistic.
For the bosonic part of the spectrum we have the right now familiar
Plethystic function already introduced in the previous chapters that
from now on we will call it the bosonic Plethystic function ( @xmath ):

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.3.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This function takes a certain generating function @xmath and generates
the new partition functions @xmath counting all the possible @xmath
times symmetric products of the constituents of @xmath , implementing in
this way the bosonic statistic, as it is possible to see from the left
hand side of ( 7.3.25 ). For the fermionic part it is useful to
introduce the fermionic Plethystic function ( @xmath ) [ 63 ] :

  -- -- -- ----------
           (7.3.26)
  -- -- -- ----------

This function generate the partition functions @xmath counting all the
possible @xmath -times anti symmetric products of the objects counted by
@xmath , and implements in this way the fermionic statistic, as it is
possible to see from the left hand side of ( 7.3.26 ).

Once we have defined the three basic generating functions (one for each
one of the states in ( 7.3 )), the counting problem for a generic quiver
gauge theories translates in counting the states in the Fock space
defined in ( 7.3.23 ).

Let us define the following chemical potentials:

-   @xmath labels the flavor charges;

-   @xmath labels the baryonic charges;

-   @xmath labels the spin

-   @xmath labels the number of @xmath fields.

For each of the sectors in ( 7.3 ) we can associate a generating
function, counting the single particle operators with a fixed set of
baryonic charges @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.3.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

With these definitions the finite @xmath counting is implemented by the
following total generating function of the chiral ring:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the expression @xmath means @xmath , and @xmath is what in the
previous chapters we called the multiplicities: the number of equal
generating functions with the same set of baryonic charges and
distinguished just by the field theory content. The meaning of ( 7.3 )
is: with the @xmath functions we implement the right statistic for the
various states and then we sum over all the possible sectors with fixed
baryonic charges taking into account the possible presence of
multiplicities.

To obtain the generating function for the chiral ring with fixed number
of branes @xmath one have just to take the @xmath times derivatives of (
7.3 ) with respect to the parameter @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.3.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

What we miss is to construct the generating functions for the two
sectors of the Hilbert space containing the fields @xmath once we know
@xmath . This one is an easy task and can be solved in an elegant way
introducing a superfield formalism. Let us introduce the usual set of
anti commuting variables @xmath such that:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.3.30)
  -- -------- -- ----------

the dimension of the theta variables is @xmath and we will label it with
@xmath , in addition they carry a spin degrees of freedom that we will
label with @xmath for the @xmath spin case and @xmath for @xmath spin
case. As we have understood in the previous chapters the generic chiral
gauge invariant operators constructed with only the scalar superfields
of the theory is an @xmath -times symmetric product of @xmath chiral
fields “building blocks”: the @xmath fields without insertion of @xmath
. For simplicity from now on we will call @xmath the generic scalar
building block, where with @xmath we mean the specific set of @xmath
flavor charges and with @xmath the specific set of @xmath baryonic
charges of the operator. Given the relation inside the chiral ring and
the decomposition of the Hilbert space of the chiral ring we propose a
superfield formalism in which the super chiral fields are generically
given by:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.3.31)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Introducing the chemical potential @xmath counting the number of @xmath
fields, it is by now clear that the complete generating function for
@xmath is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.3.32)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Once we have defined ( 7.3.32 ) we can safely divide it in the fermionic
part and the bosonic one:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.3.33)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The statistical behavior of the field ( 7.3.31 ) will be a mixed bosonic
and fermionic statistic and this fact is implemented by the generalized
@xmath function:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.3.34)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Let us now take the first derivatives of this expression and look at the
form of the finite @xmath generating functions:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.3.35)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This expression clearly reproduce the @xmath counting we started with.

The two times derivatives is more interesting: here we can start
observing the mixed statistic.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Let us comment factor by factor the equation ( 7.3 ): the first two
factors take into account the bosonic statistic of the scalar part of
the chiral ring, and in the usual partition functions we have written in
the previous chapters that all. Here instead we have many more terms.
The second two factors are due to the bosonic statistic of the part of
the chiral ring with the insertions of the field @xmath . The third
factor describe the mixing between the two bosonic sectors of the chiral
ring. The fourth two factors is probably the most interesting one: it
has the same form of the first and the second, but it has one minus sign
more: this is due to the fermionic behavior of @xmath . This factor
implement the fermionic statistic of the operators in the chiral ring
with the insertions of the field @xmath . The last two factors are due
to the mixing between the bosonic and fermionic part of the chiral ring.

Before concluding this section we can make a comment regarding the
@xmath mesonic branch of the chiral ring for generic quiver gauge
theories. We learnt how to obtain the generating functions with @xmath
for the scalar mesonic chiral ring of a quiver gauge theory counting the
gauge invariant operators according to their dimensions:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.3.37)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Once we know the @xmath factors in ( 7.3.37 ), the general form for the
function @xmath generating the Hilbert series for the finite @xmath
mesonic counting is:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

### 7.4 The @xmath Case Revisited

In this section we will very briefly review the case @xmath using the
general technology developed in the previous section.

The basic idea is to pass from the @xmath invariant tensor, that does
not depend on the number of colors @xmath , to the @xmath invariant
tensor that has built in the dependence on @xmath . In this way the
basic generating function counting the gauge invariant operators in the
chiral ring for @xmath is the one counting the single trace in the limit
@xmath and all the counting for finite @xmath can be obtained starting
from the single trace @xmath generating function.

Following the prescription of the previous section we have just to
compute the generating function @xmath for @xmath . Using the
equivariant index theorem this is easy to compute in general, and in the
particular case of @xmath this function counts the holomorphic functions
on @xmath according to their degree and it is exactly the first one in (
7.2 ):

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.4.38)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Now we must implement the superfield prescription and write:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.4.39)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which is exactly the one obtained in section 8.2.9 .

To implement the finite @xmath counting we have just to use the
generalized @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.4.40)
  -- -------- -- ----------

One can easily checks that ( 7.4.40 ) reproduce the equation ( 7.2 ).

Now one can take the first few derivatives of ( 7.4.40 ) and looking for
the corresponding gauge invariant operators finding agreement between
our counting and the field theory spectrum. We refer the interested
reader to [ 29 ] .

### 7.5 The Conifold

To give an idea of the general procedure it is worthwhile to shortly
study the less trivial example of the conifold gauge theory. This
example contains almost all the properties of the generic case (except
the multiplicity problems already discussed in chapter 5 ). In this
section we just give a short review of the main steps for the
construction of the complete partition function and we refer the reader
to [ 29 ] for more a complete discussion and some checks.

The conifold gauge theory is already familiar. It has the gauge group
@xmath . The basic chiral fields are the four scalar superfields:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.5.41)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The @xmath fields transform in the fundamental of @xmath and the anti
fundamental of @xmath , while the @xmath fields transform in the
fundamental of @xmath and the anti fundamental of @xmath ; and the
chiral spinor superfields for the two factors of the gauge group @xmath
:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.5.42)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The cinematical relations in the chiral ring are:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.5.43)
  -- -------- -- ----------

while the dynamical ones coming from the super potential are:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.5.44)
  -- -------- -- ----------

#### 7.5.1 The Mesonic Chiral Ring

Let’s start from the easy case of the mesonic chiral ring.

The generating function for the scalar part of the chiral ring is ⁶ ⁶ 6
to be in line with the literature in the generating functions for the
conifold we will use the chemical potential @xmath to label the @xmath
charge of the chiral fields: @xmath , @xmath . ( 1.5.26 ):

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.5.45)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Using the prescription of section 7.3 the complete @xmath mesonic
generating function is:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.5.46)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Now we have just to apply the @xmath formalism and we obtain the mesonic
generating function for finite @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.5.47)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Observe that this expression has the general form of equation ( 7.3 ).
Using the relations ( 7.5.43 ) it is easy to understand why this
procedure works. The equations ( 7.5.43 ) shows that the single trace
operators of the mesonic chiral ring satisfy:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.5.48)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which means that we must consider only the diagonal part of the spinor
superfield, namely:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.5.49)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Hence the single trace operators of the mesonic chiral ring are:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.5.50)
  -- -------- -- ----------

From ( 7.5.50 ) it is easy to understand that whenever we know the
scalar mesonic generating function for @xmath , the complete one is just
the one dressed as in ( 7.5.46 ).

The interested reader can now expand the generating function for the
first few values of @xmath and check the result against the field theory
[ 29 ] .

Now that we have understood some basic properties about the mesonic
chiral ring let us pass to the more interesting case of the baryonic
one.

#### 7.5.2 The Baryonic Conifold’s Chiral Ring

We would like to write down the complete generating function for the
chiral ring of the conifold theory containing all the @xmath @xmath
degrees of freedom of the theory: namely the mesonic sector ( @xmath ),
all the operators charged under the @xmath baryonic symmetry and of
course all the possible fermionic degrees of freedom @xmath .

##### The @xmath Baryonic Sector

Let us start analyzing the problem in the easy case of fixed baryonic
charge @xmath , and for simplicity we will analyze the sector @xmath .

The prescription given in section 7.3 basically says that we just need
to know the @xmath generating function for the scalar chiral ring. We
computed it in section 3.6.2 and it is:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.5.51)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Now we have to dress it with usual “supermultiplet” charges:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.5.52)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The meaning of this procedure is easily explained in the case of the
conifold. Using the relations ( 7.5.43 ) we understand that the
operators in the chiral ring in the case @xmath are ⁷ ⁷ 7 Observe in the
case @xmath the operators are no more matrices but numbers. :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.5.53)
  -- -------- -- ----------

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.5.54)
  -- -------- -- ----------

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.5.55)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The generating function ( 7.5.51 ) counts all the operators of the form
( 7.5.53 ), while the dressed one ( 7.5.52 ) takes into account also the
operators in ( 7.5.54 ) and ( 7.5.55 ).

Let us now apply the rules explained in section 7.3 to implement the
finite @xmath counting.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In the case @xmath we have the following generating function:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.5.57)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

One can now expands the various generating functions for different
values of @xmath and checks the result against the field theory spectrum
[ 29 ] .

Once again observe, as already explained in section 7.3 , that we are
counting BPS operators in the conifold with gauge group @xmath , where
the @xmath factor is the diagonal @xmath of the UV gauge group @xmath .
The chiral bifundamental fields @xmath , @xmath , are not charged under
this diagonal @xmath . Even if it is possible to obtain the “pure @xmath
” counting, it is more natural and economic to continue to keep the
overall @xmath factor, and we will indeed continue in this way in the
following.

##### The Complete Generating Function for the Conifold

Now we would like to write down the complete generating function for the
conifold containing all the baryonic charges and all the fermionic
degrees of freedom. The general procedure explained in section 7.3 tells
us that the complete generating function @xmath is obtained by summing
over all the possible baryonic charges @xmath the generalized @xmath of
the @xmath generating functions with fixed baryonic charge @xmath . In
the conifold case there is just one baryonic charge @xmath running from
@xmath to @xmath and there are no multiplicities. Hence equations ( 7.3
) and ( 7.3.34 ) become:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.5.59)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In chapter 4 we gave the @xmath generating functions for the scalar part
of the chiral ring:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

hence

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.5.60)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Let us start as usual with the @xmath generating function.

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath               (7.5.61)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

This result is easily explained. In the case @xmath the possible
generators in the chiral ring are:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.5.62)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The theory does not have superpotential and hence the scalar chiral ring
is freely generated and one has just to impose the relations coming from
the @xmath fields. As usual one can expand the generating function and
check against the field theory spectrum [ 29 ] .

Now we would like to compute the generating function @xmath for the
conifold with @xmath , counting all the operators in the chiral ring.
Using the relations:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.5.63)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

One can easily obtain:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The easiest way to do this computation is to pass from the chemical
potentials @xmath and @xmath , counting the @xmath charge and the
baryonic charge, to the chemical potentials @xmath , @xmath counting the
number of @xmath and @xmath fields, and sum over all the @xmath
symmetric representations:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.5.65)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

It is now easy to expand ( 7.5.65 ) in terms of @xmath , @xmath and find
an expression to compare with the field theory result. It is easy to see
that the generating function counts the gauge invariant operators in the
right way [ 29 ] .

### 7.6 Summary and Discussions

In this chapter we extended the analysis of the chiral ring for gauge
theory on D brane at singularities explaining how it is possible to add
the fermionic degrees of freedom to the bosonic chiral ring considered
in previous chapters. We presented a systematic way to construct the
complete generating functions for any quiver gauge theories of which we
are able to write down the scalar part of the generating functions:
namely the infinite class of gauge theories dual to toric singularities,
to quotient singularities, to complex cones over delPezzo surfaces, and
many more.

We solved the problem of adding the @xmath spinorial degrees of freedom
by introducing a kind of superfield formalism and implementing the mixed
state statistic through the introduction of the fermionic version of the
Plethystic exponential.

Right now we have a good and global understanding of the structure of
the chiral ring of a huge number of quiver gauge theories. Possible
future developments could be a systematic study of the statistical
properties of these gauge theories, the large quantum number behavior of
the various partition functions, the phase structure of these theories,
and maybe their application to related problems such as the holographic
duals of these thermodynamical properties. The generating functions
constructed in this chapter contain the information about the density
distribution of the @xmath degrees of freedom of the @xmath and hence
about the entropy and more generically the statistical and
thermodynamical properties of quiver gauge theories. For this reason
they could be a good starting point for a microscopic understanding of
the entropy of the recently constructed @xmath black holes [ 32 , 33 ,
108 , 109 ] .

A comment is mandatory: the partition functions of quiver gauge theories
we studied till now are mainly based on undeformed @xmath . Usually
@xmath admits a set of marginal deformations that leave the theory
conformally invariant. It would be interesting to study how the @xmath
spectra change when we turn on marginally operators in the field theory.
In the next chapter we will deal with this problem for a specific class
of deformations.

Another very interesting problem would be to study the BPS spectra in
the non conformal case. This topic is leave for future investigations.

## Chapter 8 @xmath-Deformed Gauge Theory

Super Conformal Field Theories usually come in families. Namely there
exist a manifold of coupling constants where the theory is
superconformal. Along this manifold the value of the central charge and
of all the R-charges of the theory are constant, but the global
symmetries can be partially broken and the moduli space can be modified:
namely some of the directions can be uplifted. In the case of D3 branes
at singularities the uplifted of some directions in the moduli space is
due to the presence of fluxes in the background that behave as potential
for the D3 branes.

There exist a marginal deformation common to all the gauge theories on
D3 branes at toric CY singularities that we have studied till now: the
@xmath -deformation. This deformation is a specific modification,
depending on the complex parameter @xmath , of the coefficients of the
superpotential. As a consequence the moduli space of the gauge theory is
partially uplifted and the dual geometry is no more neither CY neither
complex. Indeed in this chapter we consider the class of super-conformal
@xmath -deformed @xmath gauge theories dual to string theory on @xmath
with fluxes, where @xmath is a deformed Sasaki-Einstein manifold. The
supergravity backgrounds are explicit examples of Generalised Calabi-Yau
manifolds: the cone over @xmath admits an integrable generalised complex
structure in terms of which the BPS sector of the gauge theory can be
described. We will study the moduli spaces of the deformed toric @xmath
gauge theories on a number of examples. Using the dual supergravity
background and the techniques from Generalized Complex Geometry the
results in gauge theory can be explicitly checked studying the moduli
spaces of D3 and D5 static and dual giant probes. In this chapter we
will just study the mesonic moduli space and the mesonic chiral ring of
the SCFT from the field theory prospective, and we will leave the study
of the dual gravity side to the literature [ 30 ] .

### 8.1 Generalities

The super-conformal gauge theories living on D3-branes at singularities
generally admit marginal deformations. A particularly interesting case
of marginal deformation for theories with @xmath global symmetries is
the so called @xmath -deformation [ 110 ] . The most famous example is
the @xmath -deformation of @xmath SYM which has been extensively studied
both from the field theory point of view and the dual gravity
perspective. In particular, in [ 110 ] , Lunin and Maldacena found the
supergravity dual solution, which is a completely regular @xmath
background. Their construction can be generalized to the super-conformal
theories associated with the recently discovered Sasaki-Einstein
backgrounds @xmath [ 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 ] . More generally, all
toric quiver gauge theories admit @xmath -deformations [ 111 ] and, have
regular gravitational duals. The resulting @xmath -deformed theories are
interesting both from the point of view of field theory and of the
gravity dual.

On the field theory side, we deal with a gauge theory with a deformed
moduli space of vacua and a deformed spectrum of BPS operators. The case
of @xmath SYM has been studied in details in the literature [ 112 , 113
, 114 , 115 , 116 , 117 ] . In this chapter we would like to extend this
analysis to a generic toric quiver gauge theory to see how some of the
properties of the moduli space and of the BPS spectrum of the theory
studied till now are modified in the @xmath -deformed case. The moduli
space of the @xmath -deformed gauge theory presents the same features as
in @xmath case. In particular, its structure depends on the value of the
deformation parameter @xmath . For generic @xmath the deformed theory
admits a Coulomb branch which is given by a set of complex lines. For
@xmath rational there are additional directions corresponding to Higgs
branches of the theory.

On the gravity side, the dual backgrounds can be obtained from the
original Calabi-Yaus with a continuous T-duality transformation using
the general method proposed in [ 110 ] . It is possible to study the
@xmath -deformed background even in the cases where the explicit
original Calabi-Yau metric is not known. The toric structure of the
original background is enough. Besides the relevance for AdS/CFT, the
@xmath -deformed backgrounds are also interesting from the geometrical
point view. They are Generalised Calabi-Yau manifolds [ 118 , 119 ] :
after the deformation the background is no longer complex, but is still
admits an integrable generalised complex structure. Actually the @xmath
-deformed backgrounds represent one of the few explicit known examples
of generalised geometry solving the equation of motions of type II
supergravity. ¹ ¹ 1 For other non compact examples see [ 120 , 121 ] and
for compact ones [ 122 ] . . The extreme simplicity of such backgrounds
make it possible to explicitly apply the formalism of Generalised
Complex Geometry [ 123 , 124 ] which, provides an elegant way to study
T-duality and brane probes [ 125 , 126 , 127 ] .

The connection between gravity and field theory is provided by the study
of supersymmetric D-brane probes moving on the @xmath -deformed
background. This is basically an extension of the string states/gauge
operators map we have explained in the previous chapters. Indeed it is
possible to analyze the case of static D3 and D5 probes, as well as the
case of D3 and D5 dual giant gravitons [ 30 ] , and study in details
existence and moduli space of such probes. In the @xmath -deformed
background, both static D3 probes and D3 dual giants can only live on a
set of intersecting complex lines inside the deformed Calabi-Yau,
corresponding to the locus where the @xmath toric fibration degenerates
to @xmath . This is in agreement with the abelian moduli space of the
@xmath -deformed gauge theory which indeed consists of a set of lines.
Moreover, in the case of rational @xmath It is possible to demonstrate
the existence of both static D5 probes and D5 dual giant gravitons with
a moduli space isomorphic to the original Calabi-Yau divided by a @xmath
discrete symmetry. This statement is the gravity counterpart of the fact
that, for rational @xmath , new branches are opening up in the moduli
space of the gauge theory [ 112 , 113 , 114 , 115 , 116 ] .

To do not go too much far away from the main spirit of this Thesis, in
this chapter we will just look to the field theory side, and we refer
the reader to [ 30 ] for a complete discussion about the gravity dual.

The chapter is organized as follows. In section 8.2 we introduce the
structure of the @xmath -deformed gauge theory for a general toric CY
singularity @xmath . In section 8.3 we explain in complete generality
how to obtain the non abelian BPS conditions for the mesonic chiral ring
and @xmath -deformed mesonic moduli space directly from the geometry of
@xmath . In section 8.4 we study the mesonic abelian moduli space, and
in section 8.5 we discuss the particular case of rational @xmath . In
these last two sections we give some explicit examples of @xmath
-deformed mesonic moduli space and chiral spectrum, based on @xmath
-deformation of the gauge theories associated to @xmath , the conifold,
the SPP, and the @xmath singularities.

### 8.2 @xmath-Deformed Quiver Gauge Theories

The entire class of super-conformal gauge theories living on D3-branes
at toric conical Calabi-Yau singularities @xmath admits marginal
deformations. The most famous example is the @xmath -deformation of
@xmath SYM with @xmath gauge group where the original superpotential

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is replaced by the @xmath -deformed one

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

A familiar argument due to Leigh and Strassler [ 110 ] shows that the
@xmath -deformed theory is conformal for all values of the @xmath
parameter.

Similarly, a @xmath -deformation can be defined for the conifold theory.
The gauge theory has gauge group @xmath and bi-fundamental fields @xmath
and @xmath transforming in the representations @xmath and @xmath of the
global symmetry group @xmath , respectively, and superpotential

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The @xmath -deformation corresponds to the marginal deformation where
the superpotential is replaced by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Both theories discussed above possess a @xmath geometric symmetry
corresponding to the isometries of the internal space @xmath , one
@xmath is an R-symmetry while the other two act on the fields as flavour
global symmetries. The @xmath -deformation is strongly related to the
existence of such @xmath symmetry and has a nice and useful
interpretation in terms of non-commutativity in the internal space [ 110
] . The deformation is obtained by selecting in @xmath the two flavor
symmetries @xmath commuting with the supersymmetry charges and using
them to define a modified non-commutative product. This corresponds in
field theory to replacing the standard product between two matrix-valued
elementary fields @xmath and @xmath by the star-product

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath and @xmath are the charges of the matter fields under the
two @xmath flavor symmetries and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The @xmath -deformation preserves the @xmath geometric symmetry of the
original gauge theory, while other marginal deformations in general
further break it.

All the superconformal quiver theories obtained from toric Calabi-Yau
singularities @xmath have a @xmath symmetry corresponding to the
isometries of @xmath and therefore admit exactly marginal @xmath
-deformations. The theories have a gauge group @xmath , bi-fundamental
fields @xmath and a bipartite structure which is inherited from the
dimer construction [ 9 , 10 , 11 , 73 ] . The superpotential contains an
even number of terms @xmath naturally divided into @xmath terms weighted
by a @xmath sign and @xmath terms weighted by a @xmath sign

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The @xmath -deformed superpotential is obtained by replacing the
ordinary product among fields with the star-product ( 8.2.5 ) and can
always be written [ 111 , 30 ] , after rescaling fields as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is some rational number. It is obvious how @xmath SYM and
the conifold fit in this picture.

We will be interested in the effects of the @xmath -deformation on the
moduli space and on the BPS operators of the field theory. For
simplicity in this chapter we will concentrated in the mesonic moduli
space and in the mesonic chiral ring, where the effect of the marginal
deformation is already remarkable. Indeed the @xmath -deformation
drastically reduces the mesonic moduli space of the theory, which, as we
learnt int the previous chapters, is originally isomorphic to the @xmath
-fold symmetric product of the internal Calabi-Yau. To see quickly what
happens consider the case where the @xmath groups are replaced by @xmath
’s - by abuse of language we can refer to this as the @xmath case.
Physically, we are considering a mesonic direction in the moduli space
where a single D3-brane is moved away from the singularity. In the
undeformed theory the D3-brane probes the Calabi-Yau @xmath while in the
@xmath -deformed theory it can only probe a subvariety consisting of
complex lines intersecting at the origin. This can be easily seen in
@xmath and in the conifold case.

For @xmath SYM the F-term equations read

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.2.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where here and in the following @xmath . Since @xmath , @xmath , @xmath
are c-numbers in the @xmath case, these equations are trivially
satisfied for @xmath , implying that the moduli space is given by three
unconstrained complex numbers @xmath , @xmath , @xmath giving a copy of
@xmath . However, for @xmath these equations can be satisfied only on
the three lines given by the equations @xmath , or @xmath , or @xmath .
Only one field among @xmath , @xmath , @xmath is different from zero at
a time.

For the conifold the F-term equations read

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.2.10)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

These equations are again trivial for @xmath and @xmath , the fields
becoming commuting c-numbers. The brane moduli space is parametrized by
the four gauge invariant mesons

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.2.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which are not independent but subject to the obvious relation @xmath .
This is the familiar description of the conifold as a quadric in @xmath
. For @xmath , the F-term constraints ( 8.2 ) are solved when exactly
one field @xmath and one field @xmath are different from zero. This
implies that only one meson can be different from zero at a time. The
moduli space thus reduces to the four lines

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.2.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Using the dual gravity solutions it is possible to show, in complete
generality [ 30 ] , that for @xmath -deformed toric quivers the abelian
mesonic moduli space is reduced to @xmath complex lines, where @xmath is
the number of vertices in the toric diagram of the singularity. We will
give a generic construction of the mesonic moduli space of the gauge
theory using toric techniques in the following sections.

Something special happens for @xmath rational. New branches in the
moduli space open up. The @xmath case was originally discussed in [ 112
, 113 ] and the conifold in [ 129 ] . In all cases these branches can be
interpreted as one or more branes moving on the quotient of the original
Calabi-Yau @xmath by a discrete @xmath symmetry. Even in this case it is
possible to describe these branes explicitly in the gravitational duals
and we refer the reader to [ 30 ] for a detailed discussion. In the
following sections we will just look at the field theory analysis of
these vacua and we will show that it is possible to analyze the @xmath
rational case in complete generality.

### 8.3 Non Abelian BPS Conditions

In order to understand the full mesonic moduli space of the gauge theory
we need to study general non-abelian solutions of the F term equations.
Before attacking the general construction, we consider @xmath SYM and
the conifold.

In the @xmath SYM case, we form mesons out of the three adjoint fields
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath . The non-abelian BPS conditions for these
mesonic fields are given in equation ( 8.2.9 ) and can be considered as
equations for three @xmath matrices. In the @xmath case this equations
tell us that we can diagonalize the three mesons and the eigenvalues
describe an @xmath times symmetric product of @xmath .

In the conifold case, we can define four composite mesonic fields which
transform in the adjoint representation of one of the two gauge groups

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.3.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and consider the four mesons @xmath as @xmath matrices. We could use the
second gauge group without changing the results. With a simple
computation using the F-term conditions ( 8.2 ) we derive the following
matrix commutation equations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (8.3.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and the matrix equation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.3.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which is just the conifold equation. For @xmath these conditions
simplify. All the mesons commute and the @xmath matrices @xmath can be
simultaneous diagonalized. The eigenvalues are required to satisfy the
conifold equation( 8.3.15 ) and therefore the moduli space is given by
the symmetrized product of @xmath copies of the conifold, as expected.

An interesting observation is that, for the @xmath SYM and ( 8.3 ) for
the conifold, the mesonic F-term conditions for @xmath can be obtained
by using the non commutative product defined in ( 8.2.5 ) directly on
the mesonic fields. The charges of mesons for @xmath and the conifold
are shown in Figure 8.1 .

The BPS conditions for the Calabi-Yau case, which require that every
pair of mesonic fields @xmath and @xmath commute, are replaced in the
@xmath -deformed theory by a non commutative version

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.3.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

It is an easy exercise, using the assignment of charges shown in Figure
8.1 , to show that these modified commutation relations reproduce
equations ( 8.2.9 ) and ( 8.3 ).

This simple structure extends to a generic toric gauge theory. The
algebraic equations of the Calabi-Yau give a set of matrix equations for
mesons. In the undeformed theory, all mesons commute, while in the
@xmath -deformed theory the original commutation properties are replaced
by their non commutative version ( 8.3.16 ).

#### 8.3.1 The @xmath-Deformed Mesonic Chiral Ring

Let us see, in a bit more detail, how the @xmath -deformed mesonic
chiral ring is obtained for a generic CY toric singularity @xmath . As
we explained in chapter 1 a toric variety is reconstructed as a set of
algebraic constraints in some ambient space looking at the linearly
dependence constraints among the integer vectors generating the dual
cone @xmath . The generators @xmath , @xmath of the dual cone are the
basis @xmath of the mesonic chiral ring in the gauge theory and the sum
relations between points in the dual cone become multiplicative
relations among mesons in the field theory.

For every integer point @xmath in the dual cone there exist a unique
mesonic operator @xmath modulo F-term constraints. In particular, the
mesons are uniquely determined by their charge under @xmath . The first
two coordinates @xmath of the vector @xmath are the charges of the meson
under the two flavour @xmath symmetries.

Mesons correspond to closed loops in the quiver and for any meson there
is an F-term equivalent meson that passes for a given gauge group. We
can therefore assume that all meson loops have a base point at a
specific gauge group and consider them as @xmath matrices @xmath . In
the undeformed theory, the F-term equations imply that all mesons
commute and can be simultaneously diagonalized. The additional F-term
constraints require that the mesons, and therefore all their
eigenvalues, satisfy the algebraic equations defining the Calabi-Yau.
This gives a moduli space which is the @xmath -fold symmetrized product
of the Calabi-Yau.

In the @xmath -deformed theory

the commutation relations among mesons are replaced by @xmath -deformed
commutators

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.3.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The prescription ( 8.3.17 ) will be our short-cut for computing the
relevant quantities we will be interested in. This fact becomes
computationally relevant in the generic toric case. It is possible to
show [ 30 ] that this procedure is equivalent to using the @xmath
-deformed superpotential defined in ( 8.2.8 ) and deriving the
constraints for the mesonic fields from the F-term relations.

Finally the mesons still satisfy a certain number of algebraic equations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.3.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which are isomorphic to the defining equations of the original
Calabi-Yau @xmath .

### 8.4 Abelian Moduli Space

In this section, we give evidence, from the gauge theory side, that the
abelian mesonic moduli space of the @xmath -deformed theories is a set
of lines. There are exactly @xmath such lines, where @xmath is the
number of vertices in the toric diagram. Indeed, the lines correspond to
the geometric generators @xmath @xmath of the dual cone over the real
number of the undeformed geometry, or, in other words, the edges of the
polyedron @xmath where the @xmath fibration degenerates to @xmath .
Internal generators of @xmath as a semi-group do not correspond to
additional lines in the moduli space. These statements are the field
theory counterpart of the fact that the D3 probes can move only along
the edges of the symplectic cone.

We explained in the previous section how to obtain a set of modified
commutation relations among mesonic fields. In the abelian case the
mesons reduce to commuting c-numbers. ¿From the relations ( 8.3.17 )
with non a trivial @xmath factor, we obtain the constraint

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.4.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Adding the algebraic constraints ( 8.3.18 ) defining @xmath , we obtain
the full set of constraints for the abelian mesonic moduli space. It is
possible to show in complete generality [ 30 ] that the mesonic moduli
space for a single D3 brane is:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.4.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

namely the union of the @xmath complex lines associated to the
generators @xmath of the dual cone.

We now solve the constraints in a selected set of examples, which are
general enough to exemplify the result. We analyze @xmath , the
conifold, the Suspended Pinch Point ( @xmath ) singularity and a more
sophisticated example, @xmath , which covers the case where the
generators of @xmath as a semi-group are more than the geometric
generators.

#### 8.4.1 The Case of @xmath

The @xmath theory is simple and was already discussed in section 8.2 .
The abelian mesonic moduli space of the @xmath -deformed theory is done
by the three lines corresponding to the geometric generators of the dual
cone as in Figure 8.1 .

#### 8.4.2 The Conifold Case

The abelian mesonic moduli space of the @xmath -deformed conifold theory
was already discussed in section 8.2 using the elementary fields. From
the equations ( 8.3 ) we obtain the same result: the abelian mesonic
moduli space is the union of the four lines corresponding to the
external generators of the dual cone as shown in Figure 8.1 .

#### 8.4.3 The SPP Case

The gauge theory obtained as the near horizon limit of a stack of
D3-branes at the tip of the conical singularity

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.4.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

is called the @xmath gauge theory [ 5 ] . In section 2.4.2 we have
already studied the master space of this gauge theory. In Figure 8.2 we
give the toric diagram and the quiver of the theory.

Its superpotential is @xmath The generators of the mesonic chiral ring
are

  -- -- -------- -------- -------- ----------
        @xmath   @xmath            (8.4.22)
                 @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -- -------- -------- -------- ----------

These mesons correspond to the generators of the dual cone in Figure 8.2
. Their flavour charges can be read from the dual toric diagram

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.4.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

If we now @xmath deform the superpotential of the theory and we use the
deformed commutation rule for mesons ( 8.3.17 ) we obtain the following
relations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (8.4.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In the abelian case they reduce to

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (8.4.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the last equation is the additional F-term constraint giving the
original CY manifold. The presence of the symbol “ @xmath ” is due to
the fact that the original CY equation is deformed by an unimportant
power of the deformation parameter @xmath , which can always be
reabsorbed by rescaling the variables. The solutions to these equations
are

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (8.4.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

corresponding to the four complex lines associated to the four
generators of the dual cone.

#### 8.4.4 The PdP@xmath Case

In this section we study a bit more complicated example: the PdP @xmath
theory. This is the first time we meet this example in this Thesis. We
look at this theory because this is probably the simplest example of
toric singularity with internal generators: the perpendicular vectors to
the toric diagram are enough to generate the dual cone on the real
numbers but other internal vectors are needed to generate the cone on
the integer numbers. The discussion in the dual gravity side [ 30 ]
suggests that the moduli space seen by the dual giant gravitons, and
hence the abelian mesonic moduli space of the gauge theory, are
exhausted by the external generators. We will see here evidence of this
fact.

The PdP @xmath gauge theory, [ 82 ] , is the theory obtained as the near
horizon limit of a stack of D3-branes at the tip of the non complete
intersection singularity defined by the set of equations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (8.4.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

These equations describe the complex cone over the four dimensional
compact surface obtained blowing up four non generic points in @xmath .
The toric diagram and the quiver of the theory are given in Figure 8.3 .

The superpotential of the theory is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.4.28)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ----------

The generators of the mesonic chiral ring are

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (8.4.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

From the toric diagram we can easily read the charges of the mesonic
generators

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.4.30)
  -- -------- -- ----------

To generate the dual cone @xmath on the integers we need to add the
internal generator @xmath with flavour charges @xmath . If we @xmath
-deform the superpotential ( 8.4.28 ) and we use the rules explained in
the previous section, we find that the generators ( 8.4.4 ) satisfy the
equations ( 8.4.4 ) for the PdP @xmath singularity modified just by some
irrelevant proportional factors given by powers of @xmath . We must then
add the relations obtained from the mesonic @xmath -deformed commutation
rule ( 8.3.17 )

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (8.4.31)
  -- -------- -- ----------

that in the abelian case reduce to

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (8.4.32)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The solutions to the set of equations ( 8.4.4 ) and ( 8.4.4 ) are

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (8.4.33)
  -- -------- -- ----------

corresponding to the five external generators of the dual cone. We
observe in particular that the complex line corresponding to the
internal generators @xmath is not a solution.

### 8.5 Non Abelian Moduli Space and Rational @xmath

We start to have a good understanding about the effect of the marginal
@xmath -deformation on the moduli space of the gauge theory: it usually
drastically reduced the moduli space. In this section we will see that
for some special values of @xmath it is possible that new branches open
up in the moduli space. Let us start with a very easy and explicative
example. Let us take the @xmath theory and let us analyze a couple of
BPS operators. The operator @xmath is not constrained by the F-term
equations in the case @xmath , but in the case in which @xmath it is
constrained to be zero on the moduli space of supersymmetric vacua.
Indeed @xmath using the F term equations and @xmath using the ciclicity
of the trace. This imply that @xmath unless @xmath which imply @xmath .
This is an easy heuristic argument to guess that the moduli space in the
deformed case is reduced, whichever is the value of @xmath . Let us now
consider another operator: @xmath . Using the F-term equations and the
ciclicity of the trace we obtain @xmath . This imply that @xmath unless
@xmath . And this is possible if @xmath hence @xmath , the undeformed
case, and @xmath hence @xmath . Looking at this example we understand
that for some special values of @xmath , namely rational values, new
branches of the moduli space, that are absent for generic values
(irrational) of @xmath , open up.

Let us now try to explain the general case. The F-term equations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.5.34)
  -- -------- -- ----------

give a non commutative ’t Hooft-Weyl algebra for the @xmath matrices
@xmath . By diagonalizing the matrix @xmath we can reduce the problem to
various copies of the algebra for a non commutative torus

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.5.35)
  -- -------- -- ----------

whose representations are well known.

For generic @xmath , corresponding to irrational values of @xmath , the
’t Hooft-Weyl algebra has no non trivial finite dimensional
representations: we can only find solutions where all the matrices are
diagonal, and in particular equation ( 8.5.35 ) implies @xmath . The
problem is thus reduced to the abelian one and the moduli space is
obtained by symmetrizing @xmath copies of the abelian moduli space,
which consists of @xmath lines. This is the remaining of the original
Coulomb branch of the undeformed theory, and the mesonic moduli space is
just the N-times symmetric product of the @xmath complex lines
associated to the generators of the dual cone:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.5.36)
  -- -------- -- ----------

For rational @xmath , instead, new branches are opening up in the moduli
space [ 112 , 113 , 114 , 115 , 116 ] . Indeed, for rational @xmath , we
can have finite dimensional representations of the ’t Hooft-Weyl algebra
which are given by @xmath matrices @xmath . The explicit form of the
matrices @xmath can be found in [ 130 ] , but it is not of particular
relevance for us. For gauge groups @xmath with @xmath we can have vacua
where the mesons have the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.5.37)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The @xmath variables @xmath are further constrained by the algebraic
equations ( 8.3.18 ) and are due to identifications by the action of the
gauge group. A convenient way of parameterizing the moduli space is to
look at the algebraic constraints satisfied by the elements of the
center of the non-commutative algebra [ 112 , 113 ] .

We will give arguments showing that the center of the algebra of mesonic
operators is the algebraic variety @xmath , where @xmath is the original
undeformed CY variety, and the two @xmath factors are abelian discrete
sub-groups of the two flavours symmetries. This statement in the field
theory can be checked in the gravity side showing that the moduli space
of a D5 dual giant graviton is the original Calabi-Yau @xmath divided by
@xmath [ 30 ] .

The generic vacuum ( 8.5.37 ) corresponds to @xmath D5 dual giants
moving on the geometry. The resulting branch of the moduli space is the
@xmath -fold symmetrized product of the original Calabi-Yau divided by
@xmath . Each D5 dual giant should be considered as a fully non-abelian
solution of the dual gauge theory carrying @xmath color indices so that
the total number of colors is @xmath . Indeed the mesonic moduli space
for rational values of @xmath is:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.5.38)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Let us pass to analyze some simple explicit examples, before giving the
general proof of ( 8.5.38 ).

#### 8.5.1 The Case of @xmath

The case of the @xmath -deformation of @xmath gauge theory is simple and
well known [ 112 , 113 ] .

The generators of the algebra of mesonic operators are the three
elementary fields @xmath , @xmath , @xmath . Equation ( 8.2.9 ) implies
that it possible to write the generic element of the algebra in the
ordered form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.5.39)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The center of the algebra is given by the subset of operators in (
8.5.39 ) such that:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.5.40)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

Since @xmath , the center of the algebra is given by the set of @xmath
such that @xmath .

The generators of the center of the algebra are: @xmath . We call them
@xmath respectively. They satisfy the equation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.5.41)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which defines the variety @xmath . To see this, take @xmath with
coordinate @xmath , and consider the action of the group @xmath on
@xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.5.42)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with @xmath . The basic invariant monomials under this action are @xmath
and they clearly satisfy the equation ( 8.5.41 ).

This fact can be represented in a diagrammatic way as in Figure 8.4 .
This representation of the rational value @xmath -deformation is valid
for every toric CY singularity.

#### 8.5.2 The Conifold Case

The case of the conifold is a bit more intricate and can be a useful
example for the generic CY toric cone @xmath . The generators of the
mesonic algebra @xmath satisfy the equations ( 8.3 ). It follows that we
can write the generic monomial element of the algebra in the ordered
form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.5.43)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The center of the algebra is given by the subset of the operators (
8.5.43 ) that satisfy the equations

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.5.44)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

Because @xmath , the elements of the center of the algebra are the
subset of the operators of the form ( 8.5.43 ) such that @xmath , @xmath
, mod @xmath .

The center is generated by @xmath ; we call them respectively @xmath .
The F-term relation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.5.45)
  -- -------- -- ----------

then implies that @xmath and @xmath are not independent: @xmath .
Moreover the generators of the center of the algebra satisfy the
equations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.5.46)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As in the previous example, it is easy to see that these are the
equations of the @xmath orbifold of the conifold. Take indeed the
coordinates @xmath defining the conifold as a quadric embedded in @xmath
. The action of @xmath is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.5.47)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath . The basic invariants of this action are @xmath , and they
are subject to the constraint ( 8.5.45 ). Hence the equations ( 8.5.46 )
define the variety @xmath .

#### 8.5.3 The General Case

Enriched by these explicit computations we now want to analyze the
generic case and show that the center of the mesonic algebra for the
rational @xmath -deformed ( @xmath ) gauge theory is the @xmath quotient
of the undeformed CY singularity @xmath .

For a generic toric quiver gauge theory we take a set of basic mesons
@xmath (we will call them simply @xmath from now on) corresponding to
the generators @xmath of the cone @xmath . These are the generators of
the mesonic chiral ring of the given gauge theory. Because they satisfy
the relations ( 8.5.34 ) it is always possible to write the generic
monomial element of the mesonic algebra generated by @xmath in the
ordered form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.5.48)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We are interested in the operators that form the center of the algebra,
or, in other words, that commute with all the elements of the algebra.
To find them it is enough to find all the operators that commute with
all the generators of the algebra, namely @xmath . The generic operator
( 8.5.48 ) has charge @xmath under the two flavor @xmath symmetries, and
the generators @xmath have charges @xmath . They satisfy the following
relations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.5.49)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This implies that the center of the algebra is formed by the set of
@xmath such that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.5.50)
  -- -------- -- ----------

At this point it is important to realize that the @xmath contain the two
dimensional vectors perpendicular to the edges of the two dimensional
toric diagram. The fact that the toric diagram is convex implies that
the @xmath span the @xmath flavor torus. In particular the operator
@xmath must commute (modulo @xmath ) with the operators with charges
@xmath and @xmath . The first condition gives all the operators in the
algebra that are invariant under the @xmath in the second @xmath , while
the second gives all the operators invariant under the @xmath contained
in the first @xmath . All together the set of operators in the center of
the algebra consists of all operators @xmath invariant under the @xmath
discrete subgroup of the @xmath .

The monomials made with the free @xmath coordinates of @xmath that are
invariant under @xmath , form, by definition, the quotient variety
@xmath . The toric variety @xmath is defined starting from a ring over
@xmath with relations given by a set of polynomials @xmath defined by
the toric diagram

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.5.51)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Indeed the elements of the center of the algebra are the monomials made
with the @xmath , subject to the relations @xmath , invariant under
@xmath . This fact allows us to conclude that the center of the algebra
@xmath in the case @xmath is the quotient of the original @xmath
singularity @xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.5.52)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The @xmath -deformed @xmath gauge theory and the @xmath -deformed
conifold gauge theory are special cases of this result and we refer the
reader to [ 30 ] for other explicit examples.

### 8.6 Summary and Discussions

In this chapter we extended the analysis of the moduli space and of the
chiral ring of superconformal field theories to the marginal deformed
case. In particular we studied the marginal @xmath -deformation, common
to all the toric quiver gauge theories, and its effect on the mesonic
chiral ring. We observed how the moduli space and the spectrum of the
chiral ring is drastically modified by the marginal deformation and that
it is possible to study in detail this effect using some kind of
non-commutative generalization of the usual toric techniques. To be in
line with the general philosophy of the thesis we concentrated our
studies in the field theory side of the AdS/CFT correspondence, but a
very careful analysis can be done even in the dual gravity side [ 30 ] .
In particular the gravitational duals geometry is simply characterized
in terms of generalised complex geometry. In this setup one can study
duals states to the mesonic operators in field theory such as D3 and D5
dual giants or D3 giants configurations. It is possible to verify that
the gravity computations match nicely! ! with the field theory.

In this chapter we focalized on the mesonic branch of the moduli space,
It would be interesting to extend this study to the baryonic spectrum
and to the complete moduli space of the @xmath -deformed theories.

Of course a toric quiver gauge theory has in general other marginal
deformations in addition to the @xmath -deformation. It would be very
interesting to extend this analysis to other marginal deformations. This
is a very interesting point, because the gravity dual of other marginal
deformation is in general not explicitly known. It would be nice if the
study of the moduli space and the chiral ring of the gauge theory could
help to find the dual gravity solutions.

## Conclusions

In this Thesis we have introduced some new concepts to study
supersymmetric gauge theories: the Hilbert Series, the Master Space and
the Plethystic Exponential. Using these powerful tools we have
illustrated various aspects of @xmath gauge theories. In particular we
focalized on the study of the moduli space @xmath and the chiral ring
for superconformal gauge theories with gravity duals. These theories can
be engineered putting a stack of N D3 branes at conical Calabi Yau
singularity. We were able to study in full generality the moduli space
of the abelian theory and to get some non trivial informations regarding
the symmetries of the moduli space for generic N. We explained how to
count BPS operators and the dual stringy states, and how to get from
these results a lot of informations regarding both the geometry and the
field theory. In the last part of the thesis we generalized this
approach to include the fermionic degrees of freedom of the BPS spectrum
and to study both the moduli space and the BPS spectrum for marginal
deformed gauge theories.

The Hilbert Series and the Master Space reveal very productive in the
study of supersymmetric gauge theories, and it would be very nice to use
them to study other interesting problems.

The moduli space and the chiral ring are basic concepts, common to all
the supersymmetric gauge theories, and it would be nice to apply the
tools we developed here to more phenomenological interesting theories,
such as SQCD [ 131 , 132 , 133 ] , string compactifications [ 134 , 69 ]
, or MSSM [ 67 ] . Along this line another possible step could be to
study non conformal theories with gravity dual: in particular the
spectrum of the cascading gauge theories along the renormalization group
flow [ 135 , 136 , 137 , 138 ] ² ² 2 see also [ 139 ] and reference
therein for the first steps towards a ”geometrization” of the recently
found non supersymmetric metastable vacua [ 140 ] .

It would be nice to start a statistical study of quiver gauge theories.
The first natural step is the analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the
partition functions for large charges. See [ 63 ] for some related
studies about the mesonic partition functions.

Another interesting application would be to extend at the quantum level
the classical analysis we have done so far. We have in principle all the
instruments: the study of the gravity duals must contain the quantum
moduli space and the quantum chiral ring of the gauge theory, and along
this thesis we learnt to study the supersymmetric stringy spectrum and
to map it to the gauge theory. Indeed in the thesis we observed that the
master space is not invariant under Seiberg duality. This fact may
suggest the presence of quantum corrections. It would be very nice to
systematically understand if there are really quantum modification to
the moduli space and to the chiral ring, how they are done, and how they
behave under Seiberg duality. See [ 80 ] for some results.

Another interesting extension would be to study the modifications to the
chiral ring and to the moduli space induced by general marginal
deformations other than the @xmath -deformation. It would be very nice
to see if these kind of studies could give important informations to the
dual gravity solutions. Indeed all the @xmath supergravity backgrounds
are described by the generalized complex geometry as twisted generalize
Calabi Yau. It would be wonderful if, the techniques here developed
could marry with and techniques from Generalized Complex Geometry to
obtain informations about the marginal deformed supergravity backgrounds
[ 30 ] .

Recently there were a lot of interests in instantonic corrections to the
superpotential induced by stringy instantons. In the setup of branes at
singularities the stringy instantons are euclidean D3 branes wrapped on
some four cycles. The operators they generate are determinant like. Both
the geometric embeddings and the operators they generate are very
similar to the D3 brane baryonic states and the dual BPS operators we
have considered along this thesis. It would be interesting to make more
precise this relation [ 31 ] .

The AdS/CFT proposes a non perturbative definition of some string
theories on some specific backgrounds that are asymptotically AdS.
Recently a set of black hole solutions asymptotically AdS were found and
their entropy were computed. In principle it could be possible to
“explain” the microscopic origin of their entropy counting states in the
dual field theory. It would be very interesting to see if the counting
procedure explained in this thesis could be extended to this very
interesting problem. The AdS black hole solutions are in general 1/4
BPS, and it would be very appealing to understand how to compute the
spectrum of 1/4 BPS operators, and to see if this counting match with
the black hole entropy.

An even more appealing achievement would be to compute gauge theory
partition functions for the complete spectrum, both supersymmetric and
non supersymmetric.

In the recent period there is a lot of interest in the study of three
dimensional SCFT that are supposed to describe the IR dynamics of M2
branes [ 141 , 142 , 143 , 144 ] . It seems that some of the tools we
developed in this thesis can be used also in this case [ 145 , 146 , 147
, 148 ] . It would be nice to further study this topic.

We started counting: 1,2,3,… but there are many numbers and many things
to count…the future may reserve very interesting applications based on
the studies presented in this thesis.
