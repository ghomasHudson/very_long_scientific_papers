In summary, the classical approach to phase transitions starts from the
qualitative Landau theory, that provides a framework to understand the
universal features of the transition in terms of spontaneous symmetry
breaking and the associated order parameter. Then, the theory can be
improved in two independent directions. On the one hand, one can try to
be more quantitative by keeping the mean field nature of the theory but
taking into account more microscopic details of the system: this is the
basis of the liquid theory developed in the 1950s, and it works well far
enough from the transition. On the other hand, one can remain
qualitative (i.e. forget about the microscopic details) but try to
include non-mean field effects: mainly the effect of critical
fluctuations at a second order phase transitions, that are included
perturbatively through the renormalization group, and the effect of
nucleation at a first order transition point, that are non-perturbative
in nature. This approach is presented in Tab. 1.1 .

Of course one would like in the end to develop, for a given system, a
complete theory capable of describing correctly both its qualitative
(universal) properties and quantitative (non-universal) properties.
However, already for simple liquids this seems to be a formidably
difficult task.
