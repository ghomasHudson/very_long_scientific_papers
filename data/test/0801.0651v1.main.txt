## Chapter 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Cosmological Models

The goal of cosmology is to describe the large-scale structure, origins
and evolution of the universe as a whole. Within the framework of
general relativity, a cosmological model , denoted ( @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath ) consists of a differential manifold @xmath , a Lorentzian
metric @xmath (which describes the geometry of the space-time) and a
unit timelike vector field @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

that defines the world-lines of a family of fundamental observers. In
cosmology one represents the matter content as a smooth distribution (a
continuum) whose particles represent galaxies in the present epoch. The
time-like vector field @xmath is the 4-velocity of the particles in this
continuum. One member of the congruence of time-like curves defined by
@xmath , namely the world-line of our galaxy, plays a particularly
important role, since it is the position from which we make
observations.

The evolution of the universe is assumed to be governed by the Einstein
field equations (EFEs) ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the Ricci tensor , @xmath is the Ricci scalar ( @xmath )
and @xmath is the energy-momentum tensor of the distribution of matter
and energy in the universe. Here and throughout we will use geometerized
units so that @xmath and @xmath , where @xmath is the speed of light in
vacuum and @xmath is the gravitational constant.

There are two fundamental assumptions that are used to construct models
of the universe:

-    The universe is isotropic about our galaxy. More precisely, at any
    event on the world-line of our galaxy, all directions orthogonal to
    the world-line are physically and geometrically equivalent, when the
    universe is viewed on a sufficiently large scale.

    A variety of cosmological observations ( e.g. number counts of
    distant galaxies and peculiar velocity surveys) provide support for
    assumption I in the present epoch. The strongest support is provided
    by the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation
    (CMBR) which is isotropic to within @xmath ( i.e. @xmath ).

-    The Copernican Principle. This principle states that our galaxy is
    not in a preferred position in the universe. Unlike assumption I,
    this assumption is philosophical, rather than observational.

Assumptions I and II together imply that the universe satisfies the
so-called Cosmological Principle , namely

-   the universe is isotropic about all fundamental world-lines, and

-   the universe is spatially homogeneous, i.e. all physical and
    geometric quantities do not vary in space.

It is a well-known consequence of assumptions I and II (we give a
concise proof in Chapter 2 ; see Theorem 2.1.1 ) that the metric @xmath
can be written in the form of the Robertson-Walker (RW) metric , ¹ ¹ 1
Here we use Greek indices to denote spatial indices. They can take on
the values 1, 2 or 3.

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a 3-metric of constant curvature. The preferred timelike
vector field @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

The Robertson-Walker metric provides the basis for the
Friedmann-Lemaître (FL) cosmological models that play a central role in
modern cosmology. A Friedmann-Lemaître cosmology ² ² 2 The first
explicit FL cosmological models were first discovered by Friedmann in
1929 (for some historical details, see Ellis (1989)). is a cosmological
model ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ) that satisfies the Einstein field
equations ( 1.2 ) with a suitable energy-momentum tensor @xmath , with
metric @xmath and fundamental congruence @xmath having the
Robertson-Walker form ( 1.3 ) and ( 1.4 ).

In this thesis we study FL cosmologies and their perturbations within a
general mathematical framework. In section 1.2 we provide the necessary
geometrical background for this study.

### 1.2 Geometrical Background

In this thesis we will make use of the so-called @xmath covariant
description of general relativity ³ ³ 3 See, for example, Ellis (1973),
Wainwright and Ellis (1997), p1-30, or Ellis and van Elst (1998),
Chapter 2. which has been developed for use in spacetimes in which there
is a preferred timelike congruence @xmath , as in the case of a
cosmological model ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ). The “1+3” refers to the
fact that one performs a “time + space” decomposition relative to @xmath
by projecting tensors and tensorial equations parallel to @xmath and
orthogonal to @xmath . The second aspect of the @xmath description is to
write a tensor as a sum of algebraically simpler parts, i.e. to give an
algebraic decomposition. For example, an arbitrary rank 2 contravariant
tensor can be written as the sum of a symmetric tracefree tensor, an
anti-symmetric tensor and the trace multiplied by the metric tensor.

The first step is to introduce the basic variables in the @xmath
description, which are defined by applying projection relative to @xmath
and algebraically decomposing the covariant derivative @xmath , the
energy-momentum tensor @xmath and the Riemann-Christoffel tensor as
follows:

1.  The covariant derivative of the fundamental 4-velocity , @xmath ,
    describes the kinematics of the continuum described by the vector
    field @xmath . The so-called kinematic quantities are defined by
    writing @xmath as a sum of simpler parts and projecting relative to
    @xmath . We define these quantities in section 1.2.2 .

2.  The energy-momentum tensor @xmath describes the matter and energy
    content of the universe and so gives rise to a set of quantities
    known as matter variables when decomposed relative to @xmath . We
    discuss this decomposition in section 1.2.3 .

3.  The Weyl curvature tensor @xmath , which is defined as the tracefree
    part of the Riemann curvature tensor, is decomposed relative to
    @xmath into two tracefree symmetric tensors, the so-called ⁴ ⁴ 4
    There is a formal analogy with the decomposition of the
    electromagnetic field tensor @xmath into an electric field @xmath
    and a magnetic field @xmath . electric part @xmath and magnetic part
    @xmath . We discuss this decomposition in section 1.2.4 .

The second step is to derive evolution and constraint equations for the
basic variables by using the Ricci identities and Bianchi identities in
conjunction with the Einstein field equations. We will discuss this
process in section 1.2.6 .

#### 1.2.1 Projection and Differentiation

Projection parallel to @xmath is achieved by simply contracting a vector
or tensor with @xmath . Projection into the 3-space orthogonal to @xmath
is defined by the projection tensor

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

which satisfies the identities

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Corresponding to these two types of projection, two derivatives are
defined.

The overdot @xmath denotes differentiation along the fundamental
congruence, defined for scalars as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

and for tensors as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath denotes covariant differentiation.

Following Maartens (1997), we use angle brackets to denote the
orthogonal projections of vectors, the orthogonally projected symmetric
trace-free part of tensors, and their time derivatives, i.e.

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.8)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.9)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Further, we will use the projection symbol @xmath to identify orthogonal
projection over all tensor indices, i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

The spatial covariant derivative @xmath is defined by projecting all
free indices of the covariant derivative (compare Ellis (1973), Ellis
and Bruni (1989)). For example,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

The covariant derivative of a scalar can then be decomposed into a
derivative along the fundamental congruence @xmath and a spatial
covariant derivative via

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

The totally skew pseudotensor is defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

The projected permutation tensor is then defined by (compare Maartens et
al. (1995)),

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

and is used to define the spatial curl of a vector by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the spatial curl of a rank 2 tensor by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 1.2.2 Kinematic Quantities

We now focus on the decomposition of the covariant derivative of the
fundamental 4-velocity. Following Ellis (1973, p8-11), we decompose the
covariant derivative of a unit timelike vector field @xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath symmetric and trace-free, @xmath antisymmetric, and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

It follows from ( 1.18 ) and ( 1.19 ) that

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.20)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.21)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.22)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.23)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Here, @xmath is the Hubble scalar ⁵ ⁵ 5 The rate of expansion scalar
@xmath , defined by @xmath , is often used in the expansion ( 1.18 ). ,
@xmath is the acceleration vector , @xmath is the rate of shear tensor
and @xmath is the vorticity tensor . In practice we will usually replace
@xmath by the vorticity vector , defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

which satisfies @xmath . We can write the vorticity tensor in terms of
the vorticity vector using the relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

The magnitude of the rate of shear tensor and the vorticity tensor are
defined by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We now state two useful propositions concerning an irrotational vector
field @xmath , i.e. @xmath .

###### Proposition 1.2.1

Given a vector field @xmath , there exist scalar fields @xmath and
@xmath such that ⁶ ⁶ 6 The minus sign ensures that @xmath , i.e. @xmath
increases into the future along the fundamental congruence. @xmath if
and only if @xmath .

###### Proof:

Given @xmath , it follows by differentiating that @xmath and that @xmath
, by ( 1.24 ). The converse is a special case of Frobenius’ Theorem,
which is usually stated in terms of differential forms (see for example
Flanders (1989), see the theorem on page 94). @xmath

###### Comment:

The significance of this result is that if @xmath , then the 3-spaces
orthogonal to @xmath at each point form spacelike hypersurfaces given by
@xmath , i.e. there is a one-parameter family of spacelike hypersurfaces
orthogonal to the timelike congruence defined by @xmath .

If we can further impose the condition of zero acceleration ( @xmath ),
we obtain the following result.

###### Proposition 1.2.2

@xmath , for some scalar field @xmath .

###### Proof:

Given @xmath , equation ( 1.23 ) implies @xmath . It then follows from
Proposition 1.2.1 that @xmath . This in turn implies that @xmath and
hence that one can redefine @xmath to set @xmath . @xmath

In this case, the scalar @xmath that labels the hypersurfaces is clock
time along the normal congruence.

#### 1.2.3 Decomposition of the Energy-Momentum Tensor

The energy-momentum tensor @xmath is a symmetric tensor that specifies
the total matter-energy content of a cosmological model. We use the
standard decomposition of the energy-momentum tensor with respect to a
timelike vector field @xmath (see Ellis (1973), p7):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this equation, @xmath is the total energy density measured by an
observer moving with fluid 4-velocity @xmath , @xmath is the energy flux
relative to @xmath (representing heat conduction and diffusion), @xmath
is the isotropic pressure and @xmath is the trace-free anisotropic
pressure (due to processes such as viscosity).

A perfect fluid with 4-velocity @xmath is defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

in which case the energy-momentum tensor ( 1.26 ) simplifies to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 1.2.4 The Weyl Curvature Tensor

The Weyl conformal curvature tensor (or simply the Weyl tensor ) is
defined in terms of the Riemann tensor and the Ricci tensor according to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

(see, for example, Ellis 1973, p7). We note that the Weyl curvature
tensor has all the symmetry properties of the Riemann tensor and is in
addition trace-free ( @xmath ).

It is helpful to view ( 1.30 ) as a decomposition of the Riemann tensor
@xmath , with its 20 independent components, into a tracefree part
@xmath and the trace @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

each of which have 10 independent components. The Ricci tensor is
determined at each point by the energy-momentum tensor through the field
equations ( 1.2 ). On the other hand, as we shall see later, the Weyl
tensor governs the propagation of changes in the gravitational field,
i.e. gravitational waves.

Within the @xmath formalism the Weyl tensor can be decomposed further
into an “electric part” @xmath and a “magnetic part” @xmath by
projecting @xmath and its dual orthogonal to @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

We note that @xmath and @xmath are symmetric, trace-free and orthogonal
to @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

In addition, this decomposition describes the Weyl tensor completely
since ⁷ ⁷ 7 The Weyl tensor can, in fact, be written in terms of @xmath
and @xmath (see, for example, Ellis and van Elst (1998) eq. (22)).

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

Note that through ( 1.30 ) @xmath , @xmath and @xmath provide a full
description of the space-time curvature as described by the Riemann
tensor.

#### 1.2.5 Spatial Curvature

If @xmath is irrotational, we have seen that there exists a family of
hypersurfaces ( i.e. 3-dimensional manifolds) orthogonal to @xmath . In
this situation the projection tensor @xmath can be viewed as the
3-metric induced on these hypersurfaces and the spatial covariant
derivative @xmath can be viewed as the covariant derivative determined
by this 3-metric.

Analogous to the spacetime Ricci identities, the 3-space Ricci
identities are given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the spatial Riemann tensor and @xmath is any vector
field in the hypersurfaces, i.e. @xmath . It can be shown by applying (
1.35 ) to an arbitrary vector field @xmath that is orthogonal to @xmath
, expanding the left hand side using ( 1.11 ) and ( 1.5 ) and
introducing the spacetime Riemann tensor via

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

that @xmath is related to @xmath via

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the expansion tensor of the congruence @xmath , defined
by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

Equation ( 1.37 ) is the well-known Gauss equation (see, for example,
Ellis (1973), p33-4).

The spatial Ricci tensor and spatial Ricci scalar are then defined in
the usual manner:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

Further, the trace-free spatial Ricci tensor is defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

We can obtain an expression for the spatial Ricci scalar and trace-free
spatial Ricci tensor in terms of the spacetime quantities from ( B.5 ),
incorporating the Weyl tensor through ( 1.30 ) and ( 1.32 ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.41)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.42)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Then using the field equations ( 1.2 ) in the form ( A.2 )-( A.5 ) to
eliminate @xmath and @xmath , we obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.43)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.44)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

We conclude this section with a brief digression on spaces of constant
curvature. A differentiable manifold @xmath of dimension @xmath with
metric @xmath is said to be a space of constant curvature if and only if

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

It follows by contraction that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

i.e. the tracefree Ricci tensor @xmath is zero. In addition it follows
from the twice contracted Bianchi identities that if @xmath then @xmath
is constant (see proposition 1.2.3 ). If @xmath , the Riemann tensor is
completely determined by the Ricci tensor according to ⁸ ⁸ 8 See, for
example, Ellis (1973) eq. (80).

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

It follows that if @xmath then @xmath is a space of constant curvature
if and only if @xmath . Within the framework of the @xmath covariant
formalism this result can be stated as follows.

###### Proposition 1.2.3

Let @xmath be an irrotational timelike vector field. The hypersurfaces
orthogonal to @xmath are spaces of constant curvature if and only if

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

Further, if this condition holds, then

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 1.2.6 Evolution and Constraint Equations

In the @xmath covariant formalism, the information contained in the EFEs
is displayed in an indirect manner by using the Ricci identities applied
to the fundamental 4-velocity @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the Bianchi identities ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

The latter can be written in divergence form by contracting once and
then twice and using ( 1.30 ) to introduce the Weyl tensor: ⁹ ⁹ 9 Also
see Wainwright and Ellis (1997), p27.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Riemann tensor in ( 1.50 ) is likewise expressed in terms of the
Weyl tensor and Ricci tensor using ( 1.30 ). In all these identities,
the Ricci tensor is expressed in terms of the energy-momentum tensor (
1.26 ) using the EFEs in the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

which introduces the fluid 4-velocity @xmath into ( 1.52 ) and ( 1.53 ).
Equation ( 1.18 ) is used to replace all occurrences of @xmath by the
kinematic quantities and ( 1.32 ) is used to replace @xmath by @xmath
and @xmath . Finally, one projects all three identities parallel to and
orthogonal to @xmath . The result is a set of evolution equations giving
the derivatives of @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath
and @xmath along the congruence @xmath , and a set of constraint
equations that contain only the spatial covariant derivative @xmath . We
refer the reader to Appendix A for the complete list of equations that
arise from this process.

### 1.3 Overview of the Thesis

The main goal of this thesis is twofold. Firstly, we analyze the
dynamics of so-called @xmath -fluid FL cosmologies, that is, homogeneous
and isotropic cosmologies whose matter-energy content consists of @xmath
non-interacting fluids. Secondly, we give a unified
coordinate-independent discussion of perturbations of FL cosmologies
containing a perfect fluid and a cosmological constant. Some parts of
this thesis are new, while other parts provide a unified presentation of
known results for these cosmologies. Our treatment throughout is
completely coordinate-independent since it is based on the so-called
@xmath covariant description of general relativity and in this respect
it differs from much of the current literature.

In Chapter 1, we introduce the @xmath covariant description of general
relativity and in Appendix A we give the full system of evolution
equations and constraint equations. In this sense the thesis is
self-contained. However, a reader who has no prior knowledge of the
@xmath covariant description will encounter an initially steep learning
curve. We assume the reader has a basic knowledge of general relativity
and some familiarity with dynamical systems theory (see, for example,
Wainwright and Ellis (1997), Chapter 4).

Chapter 2 plays a supporting role. In this chapter we describe the
geometrical, i.e. coordinate independent properties of the
Robertson-Walker metric, and give two characterizations of the
Friedmann-Lemaître models that highlight their very special nature.

In Chapter 3, we give a complete qualitative description of the dynamics
of @xmath -fluid FL cosmologies. A central role is played by a new
formulation of the evolution equations for these models as a dynamical
system on a compact @xmath -dimensional state space. The most important
example is the @xmath -fluid model in which the three fluids are
radiation, pressure-free matter and a cosmological constant, since it
provides a model of the physical universe. Our discussion of this model
is one of the highlights of this chapter.

In Chapter 4, we give a unified derivation of the governing equations
for scalar, vector and tensor perturbations of FL cosmologies containing
a perfect fluid and a cosmological constant, using the so-called
geometrical approach pioneered by Ellis et al (1989). We then analyze
the behaviour of the perturbations in various regimes using both exact
and approximate solutions. In particular we determine how the
perturbations affect the so-called observational quantities that
determine the extent to which a perturbed model deviates from an exact
FL model.

The Appendices contain a wealth of additional material relating to
perturbations of FL universes, not all of which is needed for the
purposes of this thesis.

## Chapter 2 The Friedmann-Lemaître Cosmologies

In this chapter we first derive the geometrical ( i.e. coordinate
independent) properties of the Robertson-Walker metric within the
framework of the @xmath description of general relativity. We then give
two characterizations of the Friedmann-Lemaître cosmologies, firstly
using the kinematic quantities and secondly using the Weyl tensor.

### 2.1 Properties of the RW Metric

In this section we show that the high symmetry of the RW line-element
leads to strong restrictions on the kinematic quantities of the
fundamental congruence, on the Weyl tensor and on the Ricci tensor. We
then derive the RW line-element assuming that the Cosmological Principle
holds.

###### Proposition 2.1.1

The kinematic quantities of the fundamental congruence ( 1.4 )
associated with the Robertson-Walker metric ( 1.3 ) satisfy

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

###### Proof.

For the RW line-element ( 1.3 ), the covariant derivative

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

simplifies to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

Furthermore, it follows from the RW metric ( 1.3 ) that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

Since the projection tensor @xmath has components @xmath , @xmath , it
follows that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

The decomposition ( 1.18 ) immediately implies @xmath , @xmath , @xmath
and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

Thus, @xmath is purely a function of @xmath , which implies @xmath .
@xmath

We now consider the restrictions on the spatial curvature associated
with the Robertson-Walker metric.

###### Proposition 2.1.2

The spatial curvature of the RW metric satisfies

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

###### Proof:

Since the hypersurfaces orthogonal to @xmath are spaces of constant
curvature, the result follows immediately from proposition 1.2.3 .
@xmath

We now show that the Weyl tensor of the Robertson-Walker metric is zero.

###### Proposition 2.1.3

The Robertson-Walker metric ( 1.3 ) has zero Weyl tensor:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

###### Proof:

We make use of the contracted Ricci identities in the form ¹ ¹ 1 These
equations are an intermediate step in deriving ( A.9 ) and ( A.13 ), and
follow from the Ricci identities, without use of the field equations. In
fact, on applying the field equations ( 1.2 ) in the form ( A.2 )-( A.5
) to ( 2.9 ) and ( 2.10 ), we obtain ( A.9 ) and ( A.13 ).

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.9)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.10)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

We note that @xmath is an immediate consequence of ( 2.10 ), on applying
proposition 2.1.1 . If we apply proposition 2.1.1 to ( 2.9 ) and 2.1.2
to ( 1.42 ), we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

which implies @xmath . @xmath

Finally, we derive the restrictions satisfied by the Ricci tensor of the
Robertson-Walker metric ( 1.3 ).

###### Proposition 2.1.4

The Ricci tensor of the Robertson-Walker metric ( 1.3 ) satisfies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Proof:

We note that @xmath follows immediately from ( 2.11 ). In order to show
@xmath , we make use of the contracted Ricci identities in the form ² ²
2 This equation is an intermediate step in deriving ( A.11 ), and follow
from the Ricci identities, without use of the field equations. In fact,
on applying the field equations ( 1.2 ) in the form ( A.2 )-( A.5 ) to (
2.13 ), we obtain ( A.11 ).

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then on applying proposition 2.1.1 to ( 2.13 ), we obtain @xmath .
@xmath

We conclude this section by showing that the Cosmological Principle, as
stated in section 1.1 , leads to the RW metric.

###### Proposition 2.1.5

If the fundamental congruence of a cosmological model ( @xmath , @xmath
, @xmath ) satisfies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the hypersurfaces orthogonal to @xmath satisfy

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

then @xmath and @xmath can be written in the RW form ( 1.3 ) and ( 1.4
).

###### Proof:

By proposition 1.2.2 , the fundamental 4-velocity @xmath can be written
as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a scalar field. We then introduce co-moving coordinates
@xmath , i.e. coordinates @xmath that are constant along the world lines
of the fundamental congruence. Then the metric and 4-velocity assume the
form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

Next, using the metric ( 2.17 ), it can be quickly shown that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

This equation, in conjunction with ( 1.5 ), ( 1.22 ), ( 2.14 ) and (
2.16 ), leads to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

We introduce the length scale function @xmath via

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

and thus can integrate ( 2.19 ) to obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since we have that @xmath , it follows from proposition 1.2.3 that
@xmath describes a 3-space of constant curvature. Thus the metric ( 2.17
) assumes the Robertson-Walker form ( 1.3 ). @xmath

###### Theorem 2.1.1 (Derivation of the RW Metric)

If a cosmological model ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ) satisfies the
Cosmological Principle relative to @xmath , then @xmath and @xmath can
be written in the RW form ( 1.3 ) and ( 1.4 ).

###### Proof:

The Cosmological Principle implies that any geometrically defined vector
orthogonal to @xmath must be zero, since otherwise it would define a
preferred direction orthogonal to @xmath . In particular, we have @xmath
. Likewise, any geometrically defined rank two symmetric tracefree
tensor @xmath that is orthogonal to @xmath ( @xmath ) must be zero,
since otherwise its eigenvectors would define a preferred direction
orthogonal to @xmath . In particular we have @xmath . The desired result
thus follows from proposition 2.1.5 . @xmath

### 2.2 Characterizations of the FL Cosmologies

In this section we present two characterizations of FL cosmologies in
terms of the kinematic quantities and Weyl curvature.

#### 2.2.1 The Kinematic Characterization

We now present the kinematic characterization of the Friedmann-Lemaître
models . ³ ³ 3 One can replace the assumption @xmath in Theorem 2.2.1 by
the assumption that the perfect fluid has a linear equation of state
@xmath . However, the proof requires a more detailed analysis and is
beyond the scope of this thesis (see instead Collins and Wainwright
(1983)).

###### Theorem 2.2.1

A cosmological model ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ) which satisfies the
Einstein field equations with perfect fluid source is a
Friedmann-Lemaître cosmology if and only if the kinematic quantities of
the fluid 4-velocity @xmath satisfy

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Proof. ⁴ ⁴ 4 Krasinski (1997) gives the outline of a proof,
referring to other sources for some parts (see page 11).

If we assume the model is a FL cosmology, the kinematic restrictions (
2.22 ) follow immediately from proposition 2.1.1 .

Conversely, assume that the restrictions ( 2.22 ) hold. Since the source
is a perfect fluid with 4-velocity @xmath , equation ( 1.28 ) implies
@xmath and @xmath . Then the conditions ( 2.22 ) in conjunction with (
A.9 ) imply @xmath , which in turn implies @xmath via ( 1.44 ). The
conditions ( 2.22 ) and @xmath in conjunction with ( A.11 ) imply @xmath
. The desired result then follows from proposition 2.1.5 . @xmath

#### 2.2.2 The Weyl Characterization

We now present a characterization of the FL models using the Weyl tensor
(see section 1.2.4 ).

###### Proposition 2.2.1

If a cosmological model ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ) satisfies the
Einstein field equations with perfect fluid source having 4-velocity
@xmath and barotropic equation of state @xmath with @xmath , and has
zero Weyl tensor,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

then the kinematic quantities satisfy

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Proof.

On account of ( 2.23 ), equations ( A.18 ), ( A.20 ) and ( A.21 )
simplify to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath , ( 2.25 ) implies @xmath and @xmath . We now make use of
the chain rule to write

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then using the perfect fluid condition, i.e. @xmath and @xmath , it
follows from ( A.15 ) and ( 2.26 ) that @xmath , and hence @xmath ,
which completes the proof. @xmath

We can now present the main result of this section, which we shall refer
to as the Weyl characterization of the Friedmann-Lemaître models .

###### Theorem 2.2.2

A cosmological model ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ), which satisfies the
Einstein field equations with perfect fluid source having 4-velocity
@xmath and barotropic equation of state @xmath with @xmath , is a
Friedmann-Lemaître model if and only if the Weyl tensor is zero:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

This result follows immediately from proposition 2.1.3 and theorem 2.2.1
in conjunction with proposition 2.2.1 . @xmath

We now present one final result which restricts the gradients of the
physical and geometrical scalars in an FL cosmology.

###### Proposition 2.2.2

A Friedmann-Lemaître cosmology satisfies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Proof:

We note that @xmath follows immediately from propositions 2.1.1 and
2.1.2 . Further, it follows from ( A.4 ), ( A.5 ) and proposition 2.1.4
that @xmath and @xmath . Hence, ( A.15 ) and ( A.20 ) along with
theorems 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 implies @xmath . @xmath

## Chapter 3 Dynamics of @xmath-Fluid FL Cosmologies

The main goal of this chapter is a description of the dynamics of @xmath
-fluid FL cosmologies. In section 3.1 , using the results from chapter 1
, we derive the basic evolution equations for @xmath -fluid FL
cosmologies and describe their behaviour using dynamical systems
techniques. In section 3.2 , we describe the degrees of freedom of the
@xmath -fluid FL cosmologies in two ways, firstly, using intrinsic
parameters and secondly, using observational parameters. In sections 3.3
and 3.4 , we apply the general analysis to the case of 2-fluid and
3-fluid FL cosmologies. Finally, in section 3.5 we give a unified
presentation of the known solutions of the EFEs for single fluid and
2-fluid FL cosmologies, and relate them to the state space analysis in
section 3.3 .

### 3.1 Behaviour and Classification of @xmath-Fluid FL Cosmologies

In this section we derive the evolution equations for @xmath -fluid FL
cosmologies without introducing local coordinates and a line-element, by
specializing the general evolution and constraint equations (appendix A
) using the restrictions derived in chapter 2 . We formulate the
evolution equations as ODEs for a set of dimensionless variables in a
compact state, which enables us to use dynamical systems methods to
describe the evolution of @xmath -fluid FL cosmologies qualitatively.

#### 3.1.1 Basic Evolution Equations

We know from theorems 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 and proposition 2.1.4 that FL
models have the following properties:

1.  the kinematic quantities of the fundamental congruence @xmath
    satisfy

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (3.1)
      -- -------- -- -------

2.  the Weyl curvature is zero:

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (3.2)
      -- -------- -- -------

    and

3.  the stress-energy tensor satisfies

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (3.3)
      -- -------- -- -------

    i.e. it has the form of a perfect fluid.

The remaining non-zero physical and geometric variables that appear in
the general evolution and constraint equations in Appendix A ( A.8 )-(
A.21 ) are the Hubble scalar @xmath , the energy density @xmath and the
pressure @xmath of the matter content. Propositions 2.1.1 and 2.1.4 show
that these scalars have zero spatial gradient

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

and hence are purely functions of clock time @xmath along the
fundamental congruence. With the above restrictions, the general
evolution and constraint equations reduce to two evolution equations for
@xmath and @xmath , namely ( A.8 ) and ( A.14 ), which read

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.5)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.6)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

where the overdot denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath . The
spatial geometry of the model is determined by the Gauss equation in the
form ( 1.43 ) and ( 1.44 ). It follows that the tracefree Ricci tensor
is zero,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

and that the spatial Ricci scalar is determined by @xmath and @xmath
according to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

In order to obtain the standard evolution equations, we introduce the
length scale function @xmath , which is defined by @xmath , up to a
constant multiple, according to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

This definition is consistent with the length scale defined by the RW
metric ( 1.3 ).

To proceed we need the following result:

###### Proposition 3.1.1

In a Friedmann-Lemaître model the quantity

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

is constant in time.

###### Proof.

A straightforward calculation using ( 3.5 )-( 3.9 ) yields @xmath .
@xmath

Since @xmath is only defined by ( 3.9 ) up to a multiplicative constant,
we may choose it to satisfy ¹ ¹ 1 The factor of @xmath is chosen for
compatibility with the RW metric.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the spatial curvature parameter . The value for @xmath
indicates whether @xmath is positive, negative or zero. Models where
@xmath and @xmath are then referred to, respectively, as open FL models
, flat FL models and closed FL models .

It is important to note that if @xmath , then @xmath is completely
determined via eq ( 3.11 ), by the spatial geometry, represented by
@xmath . On the other hand, if @xmath , equation ( 3.11 ) does not
restrict @xmath , which means that if @xmath then @xmath can be rescaled
with a multiplicative constant .

We now present the standard form of the evolution equations for FL
models (see, for example, Wainwright and Ellis 1997, p52). Using ( 3.9 )
and ( 3.11 ), equations ( 3.5 ), ( 3.6 ) and ( 3.8 ) are rewritten as
the conservation equation ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

the Raychaudhuri equation ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the Friedmann equation ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

Note that ( 3.13 ) is a consequence of ( 3.12 ) and ( 3.14 ) provided
that @xmath , as follows by differentiating ( 3.14 ).

#### 3.1.2 @xmath-Fluid FL Cosmologies

In this chapter, we consider FL cosmological models whose matter content
consists of @xmath fluids with the same four-velocity @xmath . The total
energy density and pressure are equal to a sum of the energy density and
pressure of the individual components:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

The fluids are assumed to be non-interacting, which means that each
fluid component individually satisfies the conservation equation ( 3.12
), i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

We further assume that each fluid obeys a linear equation of state with
equation of state parameters @xmath ( @xmath ), i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

with

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

The most important physical values are @xmath for pressure-free matter
and @xmath for radiation. The value @xmath can be used to represent a
cosmological constant and @xmath is sometimes considered to correspond
to a so-called stiff fluid. For definiteness we order the equation of
state parameters according to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

and assume that @xmath , i.e. at least one matter component is matter
with a non-negative pressure. The conservation equations ( 3.16 ) then
assume the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

As well, the Friedmann equation ( 3.14 ) and Raychaudhuri equation (
3.13 ) assume the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

In summary, we will use the term @xmath -fluid FL cosmology to refer to
an FL cosmological model whose matter content consists of @xmath
non-interacting fluids with the same 4-velocity @xmath and equations of
state given by ( 3.17 )-( 3.19 ). Following Jantzen and Uggla (1992), we
will use abbreviations such as @xmath -universe and @xmath -universe to
identify @xmath -fluid FL cosmologies, where @xmath denotes radiation,
@xmath denotes dust, @xmath denotes curvature and @xmath denotes a
cosmological constant.

We have shown that the state of an @xmath -fluid FL cosmology as a
function of time @xmath is determined by the functions ( @xmath , @xmath
, …, @xmath ) which satisfy the system of ODEs ( 3.20 ) and ( 3.21 ).
The state of an @xmath -fluid cosmology can equivalently be described by
the variables ( @xmath , @xmath , …, @xmath ), which satisfy the
evolution equations

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.23)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.24)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The first of these is a restatement of ( 3.20 ) using the definition (
3.9 ) of @xmath . The second follows from ( 3.6 ) on using ( 3.15 ) and
( 3.17 ). Further, upon applying ( 3.9 ), the Friedmann equation ( 3.21
) gives an additional constraint that must be satisfied, namely

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

We note that this equation explicitly determines @xmath in terms of
@xmath and @xmath when @xmath .

At this stage, we present four simple and well-known solutions of
equations ( 3.20 )-( 3.22 ) that play an important role when we
formulate the evolution equations ( 3.23 )-( 3.24 )for the @xmath -fluid
FL cosmologies as a dynamical system.

1.   Flat FL universe @xmath . For a single fluid, the length scale,
    energy density and pressure are

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (3.26)
      -- -------- -- --------

    In the case of dust ( @xmath ), this solution is the Einstein-de
    Sitter universe (Einstein and de Sitter (1932)).

2.   de Sitter universe @xmath . The de Sitter universe can be thought
    of as the special case of the flat FL universe when the single fluid
    is a cosmological constant ( i.e. when @xmath ). The length scale,
    energy density and pressure are

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (3.27)
      -- -------- -- --------

3.   Milne universe @xmath . The length scale, energy density and
    pressure are

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (3.28)
      -- -------- -- --------

    The Milne universe can be thought of as the open FL universe with
    zero matter content.

4.   Einstein static universe @xmath . This solution arises when we
    require that the length scale is constant. The length scale, total
    energy density and total pressure are

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (3.29)
      -- -------- -- --------

    where @xmath is constant. ² ² 2 The values of @xmath and @xmath
    follow ( 3.13 ) and ( 3.14 ). The matter-energy content can be
    interpreted as two, or more generally, @xmath non-interacting
    fluids. For example, for a 2-fluid model, the energy densities are
    given by ³ ³ 3 These expressions are obtained by solving the linear
    system

    @xmath

    which follows from ( 3.21 ) and ( 3.22 ) with @xmath and @xmath .
      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (3.30)
      -- -------- -- --------

    where @xmath . Einstein’s choice was @xmath (pressure-free matter)
    and @xmath (a cosmological constant) so that @xmath , @xmath and
    @xmath , @xmath , where @xmath is the cosmological constant.

#### 3.1.3 Hubble-Normalized Scalars

In this section we introduce so-called Hubble-normalized scalars , which
form a set of dimensionless variables that, together with the Hubble
scalar @xmath , describe the state of @xmath -fluid FL cosmologies.
These dimensionless scalars also play an important role in relating the
models to observations (see section 3.2.2 ).

Firstly, the density parameters @xmath , which describe the dynamical
effect of the matter densities, are defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

The total density parameter @xmath , which describes the dynamical
effect of the total matter content, is defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

It follows from ( 3.15 ) and ( 3.31 ) that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

Lastly, the dynamical effect of the spatial curvature is described by
@xmath , defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

It follows from ( 3.11 ) that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

In terms of the parameters @xmath and @xmath , the Friedmann equation (
3.21 ) assumes the simple form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

which may be further expanded in terms of @xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

We note that ( 3.36 ) implies that @xmath determines the spatial
curvature as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath         (3.38)
     @xmath   @xmath         (3.39)
     @xmath   @xmath         (3.40)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- --------

There is an additional dimensionless variable that plays a fundamental
role, namely the deceleration parameter @xmath , defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

Clearly, if @xmath then the expansion is accelerating ( @xmath ) and if
@xmath then the expansion is decelerating ( @xmath ). In an @xmath
-fluid FL model, @xmath can be expressed in terms of the density
parameters by using the Raychaudhuri equation ( 3.22 ) with ( 3.9 ) and
( 3.31 ). We write

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

The quantities @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are dimensionless,
whereas @xmath has dimensions of @xmath . Together, these variables are
fundamental quantities in the FL models and more general models (see,
for example, Wainwright and Ellis (1997), section 5.2 and chapters 12
and 13).

The evolution equations for @xmath and @xmath can be obtained by
differentiating ( 3.31 ) and ( 3.35 ) and applying ( 3.14 ), ( 3.23 ), (
3.24 ) and ( 3.42 ). On performing this procedure, we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 3.1.4 A Compact State Space for @xmath-fluid FL Cosmologies

The one drawback of using H-normalized variables is that they cannot
give a unified description of models that have both an expanding (
@xmath ) and a contracting ( @xmath ) epoch. In particular, when @xmath
the density parameters ( 3.31 ) and ( 3.34 ) are undefined ( i.e. @xmath
as @xmath ). In order to circumvent this difficulty, we introduce a set
of variables which are bounded throughout the evolution of the model.

For an @xmath -fluid FL cosmology, with total energy density

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

we define the dimensionless matter variables , which describe the
relative significance of the different matter components:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then by ( 3.44 ) we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

i.e. the @xmath are bounded.

Following Wainwright (1996, p124-5), we now introduce a curvature
parameter @xmath so as to compactify the state space:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

It follows that @xmath satisfies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

and that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

This variable thus describes the state of expansion of a model. In
addition, it describes the spatial curvature, i.e. the deviation from
flatness, as a consequence of ( 3.32 ) and ( 3.38 )-( 3.40 ). In
particular, it follows from ( 3.39 ) and ( 3.32 ) that @xmath gives the
flat FL models.

We now derive evolution equations for @xmath and the @xmath . It is
convenient to introduce a quantity @xmath that plays the role of the
deceleration parameter @xmath , but unlike @xmath , is bounded when
@xmath . Motivated by ( 3.42 ), we define

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

Together, ( 3.19 ) and ( 3.50 ) imply that @xmath is restricted by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

It follows from ( 3.15 ), ( 3.23 ), ( 3.45 ), ( 3.46 ) and ( 3.50 ) that
the total energy density satisfies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

The evolution equation for @xmath then follows from ( 3.23 ), ( 3.45 ),
( 3.50 ) and ( 3.52 ) and is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

Upon noting that ( 3.47 ) implies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

we can rewrite ( 3.53 ) as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

The form of ( 3.55 ) suggests defining a new time variable @xmath by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is essential to note that this change of variable is well-defined,
since @xmath on account of ( 3.48 ). In terms of @xmath , ( 3.55 ) reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

In order to obtain the evolution equation for @xmath we need the
evolution equations for @xmath and @xmath . First, it follows from (
3.52 ) and ( 3.56 ) that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

Secondly, equations ( 3.24 ), ( 3.45 ), ( 3.50 ), ( 3.54 ) and ( 3.56 )
lead to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

We differentiate ( 3.54 ) with respect to @xmath and use ( 3.58 ). After
simplifying using ( 3.54 ), we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

Equations ( 3.57 ) and ( 3.60 ) are the desired evolution equations. The
state space is the bounded @xmath -dimensional subset of @xmath
described by ( @xmath , @xmath , …, @xmath ) and subject to the
restrictions ( 3.46 ) and ( 3.48 ). The state space is not compact due
to the strict inequality in ( 3.48 ) and so we seek to compactify this
space, since then we can apply theorems from the theory of dynamical
systems.

In order to compactify the space, we simply observe that the right hand
sides of the ODEs ( 3.57 ) and ( 3.60 ) are well-defined, in fact
analytic, at the points @xmath , which form part of the boundary of the
state space. We can thus extend the state space to include the points
with @xmath , thereby compactifying it. Since

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

as follows from ( 3.54 ), we interpret the sets @xmath as representing
FL cosmologies with @xmath . It follows from ( 3.14 ) that the set
@xmath represents the Milne universe, given by ( 3.28 ).

###### Comments:

1.  The ODEs ( 3.63 ) and ( 3.64 ) describe the essential dynamics of
    @xmath -fluid FL cosmologies in terms of the dimensionless variables
    @xmath and the dimensionless time @xmath . Since the state space, as
    defined by ( 3.62 ) is compact, the solutions of the ODEs are
    defined for all @xmath , and as a result the ODEs define a dynamical
    system on the state space (see, for example, Wainwright and Ellis
    (1997), p87, Corollary 4.1). The evolution of an @xmath -fluid FL
    cosmology is thus described by an orbit of the dynamical system (a
    solution curve of the ODEs). As a consequence, we are guaranteed the
    existence of a past attractor @xmath of the ODEs ( i.e. an invariant
    set to which all orbits, except possibly a set of measure zero, are
    past asymptotic to as @xmath ) and a future attractor @xmath ( i.e.
    as a past attractor, except as @xmath ). The past attractor
    describes the asymptotic regime at early times and the future
    attractor describes the asymptotic regime at late times.

2.  This description of the evolution of @xmath -fluid FL cosmologies as
    a dynamical system on a compact state space is new. It generalizes
    the formulation given by Wainwright (1996) for the case @xmath .

3.  The physical state of an @xmath -fluid FL cosmology is determined by
    the variables @xmath , which are related to the dimensionless
    variables via the total density @xmath , according to

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (3.66)
      -- -------- -- --------

    (see ( 3.54 ) and ( 3.45 )). On using ( 3.66 ) to eliminate @xmath ,
    ( 3.58 ) assumes the form

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (3.67)
      -- -------- -- --------

    Then ( 3.67 ) determines @xmath as an integral in terms of @xmath
    and @xmath , up to an arbitrary constant. This freedom implies that
    each orbit determines a 1-parameter family of cosmological models ,
    whose physical variables are related by a multiplicative constant.
    Since an @xmath -dimensional dynamical system has an @xmath
    -parameter family of orbits, it follows that the class of @xmath
    -fluid FL cosmologies is labelled by @xmath parameters . We will
    specify these parameters explicitly in section 3.2 .

4.  Clock time @xmath is related to @xmath via the ODE ( 3.56 ) and can
    thus be expressed as an integral involving @xmath and @xmath , the
    latter determined from ( 3.67 ). Clock time will take on values in
    an interval

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (3.68)
      -- -------- -- --------

    where @xmath is finite or @xmath and @xmath is finite or @xmath ,
    depending on the model.

5.  The dimensionless variables @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are closely
    related to the Hubble-normalized scalars @xmath and @xmath when
    @xmath . From ( 3.32 ) and ( 3.47 ) we have

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (3.69)
      -- -------- -- --------

    Similarly, from ( 3.31 ), ( 3.32 ) and ( 3.45 ) we have

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (3.70)
      -- -------- -- --------

    Finally, from ( 3.42 ), ( 3.50 ) and ( 3.70 ) we have

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (3.71)
      -- -------- -- --------

#### 3.1.5 Invariant Sets and Equilibrium Points in the Compact State
Space

Our goal in the rest of this section is to describe the qualitative
behaviour of the orbits in the compact state space, thereby
understanding the dynamics of @xmath -fluid FL cosmologies. Since the
state space is compact, it follows that every orbit has a past and
future attractor (see, for example, Wainwright and Ellis (1997),
p99-100).

In general the attractors of a dynamical system are complicated
invariant sets. But in the present situation we will show that they are
determined by the equilibrium points of the dynamical system (section
3.1.7 ), which we now present.

The form of the ODEs ( 3.63 ) and ( 3.64 ) determines three physically
important invariant sets, given as follows:

1.   Flat FL set. This set is the @xmath dimensional subset given by
    @xmath (which corresponds to @xmath , @xmath on account of ( 3.69 )
    and ( 3.36 )). The orbits in this set describe flat @xmath -fluid FL
    cosmologies, expanding if @xmath and contracting if @xmath .

2.   Milne set. This set is the @xmath dimensional subset given by
    @xmath (which corresponds to @xmath and @xmath on account of ( 3.69
    ) and ( 3.36 )). The orbits in this set describe the Milne vacuum
    solution.

3.  @xmath -fluid sets ( @xmath ). These sets are determined by setting
    @xmath of the @xmath variables to be zero, with the @xmath remaining
    @xmath variables being non-zero. The orbits in these sets describe
    @xmath -fluid FL cosmologies.

The equilibrium points are determined by setting the right hand side of
equations ( 3.63 ) and ( 3.64 ) to zero. If @xmath , then ( 3.64 ) and (
3.65 ) implies @xmath , for one value of @xmath , @xmath , for @xmath ,
and @xmath . Then ( 3.63 ) implies @xmath ( i.e. @xmath ) or @xmath (
i.e. @xmath ). If @xmath then ( 3.63 ) implies @xmath , with @xmath
given by ( 3.65 ). In this way, we obtain the following sets of
equilibrium points:

1.   Flat FL points ( @xmath ) are given by

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (3.72)
      -- -------- -- --------

    These equilibrium points lie in the intersection of the flat FL set
    and the various 1-fluid sets.

2.   Milne points ( @xmath ) are given by

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (3.73)
      -- -------- -- --------

    These equilibrium points lie in the intersection of the Milne set
    and the various 1-fluid sets.

3.   Einstein static points ( @xmath ) are given by

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (3.74)
      -- -------- -- --------

    and so constitute an ( @xmath )-dimensional set of equilibrium
    points. These equilibrium points correspond to the @xmath -fluid
    interpretation of the Einstein static model ( 3.29 ) and only exist
    when @xmath .

#### 3.1.6 Classification of @xmath-Fluid FL Cosmologies

In this section, we will prove that the @xmath -fluid FL cosmologies
that have an epoch of expansion ( i.e. @xmath in some time interval)
form three qualitatively different generic ⁴ ⁴ 4 Invariant sets of
dimension @xmath . subclasses, defined as follows:

1.   Ever-expanding models satisfy @xmath for all @xmath .

2.   Recollapsing models satisfy @xmath , @xmath for @xmath and @xmath
    for @xmath for some @xmath .

3.   Bouncing models satisfy @xmath , @xmath for @xmath and @xmath for
    @xmath for some @xmath .

The variables @xmath and @xmath are particularly important in this
analysis. We begin with the following proposition on the behaviour of
@xmath .

###### Proposition 3.1.2

In any @xmath -fluid FL cosmology with @xmath , @xmath is strictly
decreasing (increasing) in an epoch of expansion (contraction). Further,
if @xmath then @xmath is constant.

###### Proof:

By differentiating ( 3.50 ) with respect to @xmath and using ( 3.57 ),
we obtain ⁵ ⁵ 5 This equation is equivalent to (14.15) in Wainwright and
Ellis (1997), since @xmath . The proposition is equivalent to @xmath ,
if @xmath .

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.75)
  -- -------- -- --------

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and ( 3.46 ) we have

  -- -- -- --------
           (3.76)
  -- -- -- --------

with equality holding if and only if @xmath . ⁶ ⁶ 6 Equality holds in (
3.76 ) if and only if there exists @xmath such that

@xmath

which is possible if and only if @xmath .

On recalling ( 3.49 ), it follows that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.77)
  -- -------- -- --------

which establishes the result. @xmath

This proposition leads to a second result, presented here:

###### Proposition 3.1.3

For any non-static @xmath -fluid FL cosmology, @xmath is satisfied for
at most one @xmath , and in this situation @xmath .

###### Proof:

We first show, by contradiction, that @xmath is satisfied for at most
one @xmath . Suppose @xmath and @xmath for @xmath . Without loss of
generality, we assume that @xmath for @xmath . Then by proposition 3.1.2
it follows that @xmath since @xmath is strictly decreasing whenever
@xmath . Further, by ( 3.60 ), we have that @xmath satisfies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.78)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the prime ( @xmath ) denotes differentiation with respect to
@xmath . But @xmath for @xmath implies that @xmath ( i.e. @xmath ) and
@xmath ( i.e. @xmath ) and so @xmath , which is a contradiction.

Finally, it follows from ( 3.63 ) that if @xmath , @xmath is satisfied
only when @xmath , which is disallowed for non-static models. @xmath

The main result of this section now follows immediately.

###### Theorem 3.1.1

There are exactly three generic classes of @xmath -fluid FL cosmologies
( @xmath ) that have an expanding epoch, namely ever-expanding models,
recollapsing models and bouncing models. Bouncing models occur if and
only if @xmath .

###### Proof:

Since @xmath if and only if @xmath on account of ( 3.47 ), proposition
3.1.3 states that the Hubble scalar can be zero at most once, and that
@xmath changes sign if it becomes zero. Thus models with more than one
expanding epoch are excluded, which implies that the only possible
classes are those given. If @xmath , it follows from ( 3.19 ) and ( 3.50
) that @xmath , and hence from ( 3.63 ) that bouncing models are
disallowed. @xmath

To the best of the author’s knowledge, the classification theorem is new
for @xmath , although it is a well known result for @xmath , when the
matter content is a perfect fluid ( @xmath ) and a cosmological constant
( @xmath ) (see Rindler (1977), p234-8).

#### 3.1.7 Asymptotic Behaviour of Solutions

In this section we determine the asymptotic behaviour of the three
generic classes of @xmath -fluid FL cosmologies identified in the
previous section. We will first describe the behaviour of the length
scale @xmath as a function of clock time @xmath in each of the three
generic classes of FL cosmologies, and then use these results to
determine the past attractor and future attractor.

Important in this analysis is the set of orbits asymptotic to an
Einstein static solution. In the following proposition, we demonstrate
that orbits of this type are non-generic.

###### Proposition 3.1.4

The set of orbits in the compact state space that are asymptotic to an
Einstein static equilibrium point has dimension @xmath .

###### Proof:

We can write the evolution equations ( 3.57 ) and ( 3.60 ) as a
dynamical system of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.79)
  -- -------- -- --------

on @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath ( @xmath ). The physical state space
is the hyperplane given by ( 3.62 ), and hence is @xmath dimensional.
Consider the Jacobian matrix @xmath . Upon evaluating @xmath on the
Einstein static set, given by ( 3.74 ), we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.80)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath denotes the value of @xmath at the Einstein
equilibrium point. The Jacobian matrix, when restricted to the physical
state space, has two non-zero eigenvalues

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.81)
  -- -------- -- --------

and @xmath zero eigenvalues. ⁷ ⁷ 7 The zero eigenvalues reflect the fact
that the set of Einstein static equilibrium points has dimension @xmath
. It follows ⁸ ⁸ 8 Using the Stable/Unstable Manifold Theorem. See, for
example, Perko (1996, p107). that each Einstein static equilibrium point
has a 1-dimensional stable manifold and a 1-dimensional unstable
manifold. Thus the set of orbits future asymptotic to the Einstein
static set has dimension exactly one larger than the dimension of the
Einstein static manifold, i.e. dimension @xmath . @xmath

In the next proposition, we establish the behaviour of the length scale
@xmath as a function of time @xmath , for ever-expanding models.

###### Proposition 3.1.5

If @xmath for all @xmath and @xmath as @xmath , then

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.82)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Proof:

The length scale @xmath defines a time variable @xmath according to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.83)
  -- -------- -- --------

It follows from ( 3.9 ) and ( 3.83 ) that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.84)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then, using ( 3.54 ), ( 3.56 ) and ( 3.84 ), and the chain rule, we
obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.85)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath for all @xmath and @xmath as @xmath , ( 3.85 ) then implies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.86)
  -- -------- -- --------

This completes the proof, on applying ( 3.83 ). @xmath

###### Proposition 3.1.6

For a recollapsing model, @xmath for all @xmath , and for a bouncing
model, @xmath for all @xmath .

###### Proof:

For a recollapsing model, it follows from the definition that there
exists @xmath so that @xmath and that @xmath changes sign from positive
to negative at @xmath , which implies @xmath (strict inequality follows
from Proposition 3.1.3 ). The evolution equation ( 3.63 ) now implies
@xmath . By Proposition 3.1.2 , @xmath has a global minimum at @xmath ,
i.e. @xmath for all @xmath , which gives the desired result. The proof
for bouncing models is similar. @xmath

We now determine the asymptotic behaviour of clock time @xmath ( i.e. as
@xmath ). Let

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.87)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the dependence of @xmath on @xmath is determined via equation (
3.56 ). Then @xmath and @xmath are finite or infinite depending on the
type of universe and during the evolution @xmath . Clock time is related
to the length scale via the Friedmann equation. In particular, for any
@xmath -fluid FL cosmology, we can integrate ( 3.20 ) to obtain ⁹ ⁹ 9
See p46.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.88)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is an integration constant whose inverse can be interpreted
as the characteristic length scale of fluid @xmath . On substituting (
3.88 ) into the Friedmann equation ( 3.21 ), we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.89)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Theorem 3.1.2

The following statements are true:

1.   For an ever-expanding @xmath -fluid FL model that is not asymptotic
    to the Einstein static universe, @xmath is finite, @xmath and the
    length scale satisfies @xmath for some @xmath and @xmath as @xmath .

2.   For a recollapsing @xmath -fluid FL model, @xmath and @xmath are
    finite, @xmath and @xmath .

3.   For a bouncing @xmath -fluid FL model, @xmath and @xmath are
    infinite and @xmath satisfies @xmath as @xmath .

###### Proof: Case i)

In this case, we will make use of the following elementary results from
calculus:

1.  If @xmath as @xmath , and @xmath , then @xmath , i.e. the integral
    converges.

2.  If @xmath , as @xmath , and @xmath then @xmath , i.e. the integral
    diverges.

Recall that ever-expanding models satisfy @xmath . Thus by Proposition
3.1.5 , solutions which are not asymptotic to the Einstein static
solution satisfy @xmath as @xmath and @xmath as @xmath . Let

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.90)
  -- -------- -- --------

For an ever-expanding model, this function is defined and continuous
(for @xmath ) since @xmath implies that the denominator is strictly
positive (see ( 3.89 )). Hence, we can integrate ( 3.89 ) to obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.91)
  -- -------- -- --------

Further, the integrand satisfies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.92)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath it follows from result (I) that there exists some finite
time @xmath , defined by @xmath , such that @xmath .

Similarly, we can integrate ( 3.89 ) to obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.93)
  -- -------- -- --------

Further, the integrand satisfies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.94)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath it follows from result (II) @xmath as @xmath .

For the following two cases we make use of the fact that @xmath and
@xmath are related by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.95)
  -- -------- -- --------

as follows from ( 3.22 ), ( 3.45 ) and ( 3.50 ).

###### Case ii)

For a recollapsing model, Proposition 3.1.6 implies @xmath for all
@xmath . Then ( 3.95 ) implies that @xmath is concave down on its domain
and so we can conclude there exists @xmath and @xmath such that @xmath
and @xmath .

###### Case iii)

For a bouncing model, Proposition 3.1.6 implies @xmath for all @xmath .
Then ( 3.95 ) implies that @xmath is concave up on its domain and hence
@xmath as @xmath . Since @xmath , it follows that @xmath is minimal at
@xmath . If we choose @xmath , we have that @xmath for all @xmath .

We must now show that @xmath does not go to infinity in finite time.
Choose @xmath so that @xmath for @xmath . Then @xmath in ( 3.90 ) is
defined and continuous for @xmath . We can integrate ( 3.89 ) from
@xmath to obtain ( 3.93 ). Since the integrand satisfies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.96)
  -- -------- -- --------

and @xmath , it follows from result (II) that ( 3.93 ) diverges, and so
these models satisfy @xmath as @xmath . By symmetry, we have that @xmath
as @xmath . @xmath

The past and future attractors of the dynamical system on the compact
state space can now be determined using theorem 3.1.2 .

###### Theorem 3.1.3

The past and future attractors in the state space of @xmath -fluid FL
cosmologies with an expanding epoch are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.97)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.98)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Proof:

We begin by obtaining algebraic expressions for @xmath and @xmath . From
( 3.88 ) we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.99)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then ( 3.45 ), ( 3.88 ) and ( 3.99 ) lead to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.100)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Using ( 3.47 ), we write the Friedmann equation ( 3.25 ) in the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.101)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Then using ( 3.45 ) and ( 3.99 ) we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.102)
  -- -------- -- ---------

To determine the limits of ( 3.100 ) and ( 3.102 ) as @xmath , we write

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.103)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and, using ( 3.44 ), ( 3.99 ) and ( 3.100 ),

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.104)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It follows that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.105)
  -- -------- -- ---------

since @xmath and @xmath .

Similarly, by writing

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.106)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.107)
  -- -------- -- ---------

we obtain

  -- -- -- ---------
           (3.108)
  -- -- -- ---------

It now follows from Theorem 3.1.2 and equations ( 3.72 ) and ( 3.73 )
that orbits describing models in the three generic classes approach the
equilibrium points given in table 3.1 , as @xmath and as @xmath . @xmath

###### Comment:

Since the orbits describing models in the three generic classes approach
the equilibrium points in table 3.1 as @xmath , it follows that the
density parameters @xmath and @xmath approach their values at the
equilibrium points, which we give in table 3.2 .

### 3.2 Parameterization of FL Models

In this section we introduce the @xmath essential parameters that label
the family of @xmath -fluid FL cosmologies, namely a conformal parameter
@xmath and @xmath dimensionless mass parameters @xmath , that we shall
refer to as intrinsic parameters . In section 3.2.2 , we introduce an
equivalent set of parameters, namely the observational parameters @xmath
and @xmath and show how they determine the intrinsic parameters.
Finally, we show that the evolution equations ( 3.57 ) and ( 3.60 )
admit @xmath independent conserved quantities, which characterize the
orbits in the @xmath -dimensional state space. In particular, we will
show that the values of the conserved quantities are determined in terms
of the intrinsic parameters.

#### 3.2.1 The Intrinsic Parameters

We now integrate the conservation equation and demonstrate that the
constants of integration of this equation can be used to parameterize
@xmath -fluid FL cosmologies. As we have seen previously in ( 3.88 ), on
integrating ( 3.20 ), one obtains

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.109)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The constants of integration @xmath have dimension @xmath and so each
can be thought of as defining a characteristic length scale for each
fluid via @xmath . When ( 3.109 ) is substituted into ( 3.21 ), there
results a first order ODE for @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.110)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In order to define a dimensionless length scale and time variable for
@xmath -fluid FL cosmologies, one needs to choose a preferred @xmath
that will play the role of an overall conformal factor. Typically we
will choose @xmath to be @xmath , which is a natural choice if @xmath .
In this case, it follows from ( 3.109 ) that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.111)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The dimensionless length @xmath and time @xmath are then defined as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.112)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Equation ( 3.109 ) suggests defining a set of dimensionless parameters
@xmath via ¹⁰ ¹⁰ 10 For @xmath , this equation states that @xmath .

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.113)
  -- -------- -- ---------

so that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.114)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In dimensionless form, the Friedmann equation ( 3.110 ) then reads

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.115)
  -- -------- -- ---------

For any choice of parameters @xmath , @xmath , along with the conditions

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.116)
  -- -------- -- ---------

the DE ( 3.115 ) has unique solution (as shown in section C.2 ), given
by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.117)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It then follows from ( 3.112 ) that @xmath can be written as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.118)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The line element then takes the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.119)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is given by ( 3.117 ) and @xmath is a metric of constant
curvature. ¹¹ ¹¹ 11 Equations ( 3.114 ) and ( 3.119 ) illustrate the
well-known scale-invariance of Einstein’s field equations: if @xmath is
a solution, then so is @xmath for any constant @xmath , with the matter
terms scaling appropriately, e.g. @xmath . From ( 3.9 ), ( 3.112 ) and (
3.115 ) we obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.120)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Further, using ( 3.31 ), ( 3.114 ) and ( 3.120 ) the density parameters
@xmath are written as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.121)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In summary, equations ( 3.114 ) and ( 3.118 ) show that the @xmath
-fluid FL cosmologies form an @xmath -parameter family, labelled by a
conformal factor @xmath and @xmath mass parameters @xmath . We will
refer to these parameters as the intrinsic parameters .

#### 3.2.2 The Observational Parameters

In this section we introduce the observational parameters associated
with @xmath -fluid FL cosmologies, based on the current epoch @xmath ,
which represents the age of the universe. We denote the values of @xmath
, @xmath , @xmath and @xmath at @xmath by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the Hubble constant . Then, the set of constants

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.122)
  -- -------- -- ---------

are collectively referred to as the observational parameters (see, for
example, Wainwright and Ellis (1997), p55-8).

In addition, we require the parameter @xmath , which denotes the length
scale at the present time, i.e @xmath . This quantity is not an
observational parameter, but if @xmath , @xmath can be determined in
terms of observational parameters using ( 3.35 ) and ( 3.36 ), i.e. via

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.123)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In the case of zero curvature ( @xmath ), @xmath can be chosen
arbitrarily in order to fix the multiplicative factor that determines
@xmath (also see section 3.1.1 ).

We now present the observational formulation of the @xmath -fluid FL
cosmologies. In this formulation, the dimensionless length scale and
dimensionless time variable are given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.124)
  -- -------- -- ---------

From ( 3.88 ) we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.125)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Using ( 3.124 ) and ( 3.125 ), the Friedmann equation ( 3.14 ) assumes
the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.126)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We use uniqueness of the solution to ( 3.126 ) under some appropriate
initial conditions (see section C.2 ) to conclude that in an expanding
epoch the length scale is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.127)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It follows from ( 3.9 ), ( 3.124 ) and ( 3.126 ) that the Hubble scalar
assumes the form ¹² ¹² 12 An expression of this form is given by Peacock
(1999), eq. (3.8).

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.128)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and further that the density parameters ( 3.31 ) and ( 3.45 ) assume the
form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.129)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.130)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The parameters @xmath , @xmath , @xmath in ( 3.122 ) can be related to
the parameters @xmath , as follows: First, @xmath is determined in terms
of @xmath via the Friedmann equation ( 3.37 ):

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.131)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Second, @xmath is determined in terms of @xmath via ( 3.42 ):

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.132)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Third, knowing @xmath , we can obtain @xmath by integrating ( 3.126 ) as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.133)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.134)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and @xmath has been eliminated using ( 3.131 ). As a consequence, the
only independent observational parameters are the @xmath quantities
defined by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.135)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It is useful to note that the normalized scale factor can be expressed
in terms of the redshift @xmath , defined by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.136)
  -- -------- -- ---------

(see Wainwright and Ellis (1997), eq. (2.41)). One can thus use ( 3.128
) and ( 3.129 ) to express @xmath and @xmath in terms of @xmath .

We now present the link between the observational parameters and the
intrinsic parameters. On substituting @xmath (see ( 3.31 )) into ( 3.109
) at @xmath , we obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.137)
  -- -------- -- ---------

#### 3.2.3 Conserved Quantities

We now show that the evolution equations ( 3.57 ) and ( 3.60 ) admit
@xmath conserved quantities.

From ( 3.45 ) and ( 3.114 ) we have that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.138)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We now eliminate @xmath and @xmath by taking products of powers of three
distinct matter variables (we require @xmath ). Indeed, it follows from
( 3.138 ) that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.139)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In the case of @xmath , we also obtain a conserved quantity describing
the curvature of a model. We use ( 3.9 ) and ( 3.47 ) to rewrite the
Friedmann equation ( 3.14 ) as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.140)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Then from ( 3.138 ) and ( 3.140 ), we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.141)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Since there can be only @xmath independent conserved quantities, we must
fix some of the values of @xmath , @xmath and @xmath in ( 3.139 ) and (
3.141 ) to obtain a minimal independent set. We choose @xmath , @xmath
in ( 3.139 ) (with @xmath ) and @xmath and @xmath in ( 3.141 ) and so
define ¹³ ¹³ 13 Observe that if we choose @xmath or @xmath in ( 3.142 )
we simply obtain @xmath and @xmath .

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.142)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.143)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Upon recalling that @xmath , the conserved quantities are then
determined by the intrinsic parameters @xmath according to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.144)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.145)
  -- -------- -- ---------

###### Comment:

We have derived these conserved quantities algebraically, and it follows
immediately from ( 3.144 ) and ( 3.145 ) that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.146)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It involves a lengthy calculation to verify ( 3.146 ) using the ODEs (
3.63 ) and ( 3.64 ).

If @xmath ( i.e. @xmath ) then @xmath . As described in section 3.2.2 ,
we can use the freedom to rescale @xmath to set

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.147)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which implies @xmath . Then ( 3.144 ) gives

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.148)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The conserved quantities ( 3.142 ) and ( 3.143 ) can also be expressed
in terms of the density parameters, as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.149)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.150)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

The conserved quantities are thus related to the observational
parameters by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.151)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.152)
  -- -------- -- ---------

upon evaluating ( 3.149 ) and ( 3.150 ) at @xmath . We note that
conserved quantities of this type have been previously discovered, for
example, by Ehlers and Rindler (1989) for @xmath FL universes, and more
generally by Lake (2006) for @xmath -fluid FL universes, using a
different method.

### 3.3 2-Fluid FL Cosmologies - Qualitative Analysis

We now use the results of sections 3.1 and 3.2 to give a qualitative
analysis of the dynamics of 2-fluid FL cosmologies. The results of this
section, in particular figures 3.1 - 3.3 , are contained in Wainwright
(1996), although the use of the conserved quantity @xmath is new.

#### 3.3.1 General Features

The state space is two-dimensional, being described by the variables (
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath ) subject to the restrictions ( 3.46 ). We use
( 3.46 ) to eliminate @xmath via

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.153)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The state space is then the rectangle in the ( @xmath , @xmath )-plane
given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.154)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In accordance with theorem 3.1.1 , there are two qualitatively different
classes of @xmath -fluid FL cosmologies, depending on whether @xmath or
@xmath (recall that @xmath and @xmath are assumed to satisfy @xmath ).
We will discuss these two classes in sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 using the
two most important examples from a physical point of view: ¹⁴ ¹⁴ 14
Other choices are qualitatively similar

1.  Universes with radiation and dust ( @xmath -universes, @xmath ,
    @xmath ),

2.  Universes with dust and cosmological constant ( @xmath -universes,
    @xmath , @xmath ).

An important difference between these two cases is that if @xmath the
Einstein static universe, represented by an equilibrium point @xmath ,
is included in the family of models. The point @xmath is given by ¹⁵ ¹⁵
15 The restriction @xmath ensures that @xmath , as required.

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.155)
  -- -------- -- ---------

(see equation ( 3.74 )). A second related difference is the behaviour of
the compact deceleration parameter @xmath as given by ( 3.65 ). If
@xmath then @xmath is positive on the state space ( 3.62 ) and all
models are decelerating. If @xmath then @xmath is negative on a subset
of the state space. Figure 3.2 shows that the orbits of ever-expanding
models eventually enter this subset, and as a result the models are
accelerating at late times.

The portraits of the orbits are drawn by first sketching the various
invariant sets and equilibrium points, as given in section 3.1.5 , in
particular the boundary of the state space ( 3.154 ) and the flat FL
invariant set @xmath . In the case @xmath , the orbits that are past and
future asymptotic to the Einstein static point @xmath should be drawn.
At this stage, the orbits that have been drawn represent exceptional
models and form a “skeleton” for the state space. The orbits of typical
models can now be drawn by noting the past and future attractors as
given in theorem 3.1.3 . In drawing the portraits it is helpful to note
that the evolution equations ( 3.63 ) and ( 3.64 ) are invariant under
the interchange

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.156)
  -- -------- -- ---------

i.e. changing the sign of @xmath reverses the direction of time. In
particular, the invariant set @xmath represents cosmologies that evolve
in the same way as those with @xmath , with the difference that the
direction of time is reversed. These models are contracting throughout
their evolution ( @xmath implies @xmath ) and hence are not potential
models of the real universe.

In practice the state space can be sketched numerically ¹⁶ ¹⁶ 16 For
example, using the plots[implicitplot] command in Maple. using the
conserved quantity @xmath that is defined by ( 3.143 ) for the family of
2-fluid cosmologies. On substituting ( 3.153 ) into ( 3.155 ) and
choosing @xmath , we obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.157)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The orbits are given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.158)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The value of @xmath at @xmath is denoted @xmath and is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.159)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It follows that the equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.160)
  -- -------- -- ---------

describes the orbits that are past and future asymptotic to @xmath ,
i.e. it describes the stable and unstable manifolds of @xmath .

The value of @xmath determines whether a model is ever-expanding or not,
as shown in the following table.

                @xmath                  Ever-expanding
                @xmath                  Recollapsing or bouncing
  ------------- ----------------------- --------------------------

Further, the sign of @xmath determines whether the model is open, flat
or closed. We note that all generic classes of FL models are covered by
the given values of @xmath .

In the case @xmath the critical value of @xmath is @xmath , indicating
that the flat FL models play an exceptional role as regards to future
evolution. In the case @xmath , @xmath and the exceptional models are
those that are past or future asymptotic to the Einstein static
universe. This distinction is clearly indicated by comparing figure 3.1
( @xmath -universes) with figure 3.2 ( @xmath -universes).

We note that the conserved quantity @xmath can also be expressed in
terms of the density parameters. It follows from ( 3.150 ) with @xmath
that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.161)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.162)
  -- -------- -- ---------

#### 3.3.2 FL Cosmologies with Radiation and Dust (@xmath-universes)

We now consider @xmath -fluid FL cosmologies containing radiation (
@xmath ) and dust ( @xmath ). The portrait of the orbits, shown in
figure 3.1 is drawn as described in the previous subsection.

For the @xmath -universes, the expression ( 3.157 ) for the conserved
quantity @xmath becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.163)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Equivalently, the expression ( 3.161 ) gives @xmath in terms of the
density parameters as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.164)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The value of @xmath is infinite or zero on the skeleton of the state
space:

  -------- ------------------------------------
  @xmath   if @xmath and @xmath ,
  @xmath   if @xmath or @xmath ,
  @xmath   if @xmath , or @xmath and @xmath .
  -------- ------------------------------------

Note that @xmath is indeterminate at the past attractor @xmath ( @xmath
, @xmath ) and at the future attractor @xmath ( @xmath , @xmath ; @xmath
, @xmath ). This indeterminacy arises since infinitely many orbits meet
at @xmath and @xmath .

###### Discussion:

Typical models differ qualitatively depending on the value of @xmath ,
which determines where the orbit lies in the state space. Firstly, for
ever-expanding models if the orbit passes close to @xmath , the dust
component will never be significant dynamically ( i.e. @xmath ) and this
will correspond to @xmath being large and negative. On the other hand if
the orbit passes close to @xmath then @xmath will attain a maximum value
close to 1, corresponding to @xmath being negative and close to zero.
Secondly, recollapsing models differ quantitatively by how close the
orbit comes to @xmath , i.e. by the maximum value of @xmath , which in
turn will depend on @xmath . One can determine the dependence on @xmath
explicitly, as follows:

1.  For ever-expanding models, we obtain

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (3.165)
      -- -------- -- ---------

2.  For recollapsing models an expression for @xmath and @xmath can be
    obtained by setting @xmath in ( 3.163 ) and solving the resulting
    second degree polynomial. We obtain

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (3.166)
      -- -------- -- ---------

#### 3.3.3 FL Cosmologies with Dust and Cosmological Constant

We now consider @xmath -fluid FL cosmologies containing radiation (
@xmath ) and dust ( @xmath ). The portrait of the orbits, shown in
figure 3.2 is drawn as described in section 3.3.1 .

For the @xmath -universes, the expression ( 3.157 ) for the conserved
quantity @xmath becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.167)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Equivalently, the expression ( 3.161 ) gives @xmath in terms of the
density parameters as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.168)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The critical value of @xmath , i.e. the value of @xmath at the Einstein
static equilibrium point, is given by ( 3.155 ) as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.169)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It then follows from ( 3.159 ) that the critical value of @xmath is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.170)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The value of @xmath is infinite or zero on the skeleton of the state
space:

  -------- ----------------------------------
  @xmath   if @xmath and @xmath ,
  @xmath   if @xmath ,
  @xmath   if @xmath or @xmath and @xmath .
  -------- ----------------------------------

Note that @xmath is indeterminate at the past attractor @xmath ( @xmath
, @xmath ) and at the future attractor @xmath ( @xmath , @xmath ; @xmath
, @xmath ).

###### Discussion:

Firstly, ever-expanding models differ qualitatively depending on the
magnitude and the sign of the curvature scalar @xmath . If the orbit
stays close to flat FL ( @xmath ), the curvature will never be
significant dynamically ( i.e. @xmath ) and this will correspond to
@xmath being close to zero. Secondly, recollapsing models (and bouncing
models) differ qualitatively by how close the orbit comes to the
Einstein static model, i.e. by the maximal (or minimal) value of @xmath
. Since @xmath in recollapsing models (see ( 3.155 )), the cosmological
constant will never be the dominant fluid. Similarly, since @xmath in
bouncing models, there will be no dust dominant epoch, i.e. @xmath . One
can determine the dependence on @xmath explicitly, as follows:

1.  For ever-expanding models, we obtain

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (3.171)
      -- -------- -- ---------

2.  For recollapsing and bouncing models, an expression for @xmath and
    @xmath can be obtained by setting @xmath in ( 3.167 ) and solving
    the resulting third degree polynomial.

### 3.4 3-Fluid FL Cosmologies - Qualitative Analysis

We now use the results of sections 3.1 - 3.3 to give a qualitative
analysis of the dynamics of 3-fluid FL cosmologies in which the matter
content is radiation, dust and a cosmological constant ( @xmath )
(labelling the @xmath as @xmath , @xmath and @xmath ). The analysis
given in this section is new.

#### 3.4.1 General Features

The state space is three-dimensional, being described by the variables (
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ) subject to the restriction ( 3.46 ).
We use ( 3.46 ) to eliminate @xmath via

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.172)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The physical state space is then a solid triangular prism in @xmath
given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.173)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We can construct a “skeleton” for the state space using various
invariant subsets, as shown in figure 3.4 . The choice of @xmath for any
one fluid gives a 2-fluid FL cosmology, identified as follows:

  -------- --------------------
  @xmath   @xmath -universes,
  @xmath   @xmath -universes,
  @xmath   @xmath -universes.
  -------- --------------------

Further, the orbits in the planes @xmath represent the flat 3-fluid
universes.

The Einstein static universe is represented by a line segment of
equilibrium points denoted @xmath , which is the intersection of the
planes @xmath and @xmath . The stable manifold @xmath of the set of
Einstein static points is a surface through the line segment @xmath
terminating at @xmath when @xmath and at the line segment @xmath when
@xmath . This surface can be described by an equation of the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.174)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath and @xmath restricted as in ( 3.173 ). Because of the
symmetry @xmath (see ( 3.156 )), the unstable manifold @xmath is the
surface

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.175)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We know from theorem 3.1.1 that there are three generic classes of
@xmath FL universes. Their orbits are contained in invariant subsets
bounded by the surfaces @xmath , as follows:

  -------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Ever-expanding universes   @xmath (the subset to the right of @xmath and @xmath ),
  Recollapsing universes     (the subset between @xmath and @xmath and below the plane @xmath ),
  Bouncing universes         (the subset between @xmath and @xmath and above the plane @xmath ).
  -------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

The planes @xmath and @xmath , although not invariant sets, play an
important role in describing the dynamics. The plane @xmath divides the
state space into a region of expansion ( @xmath ) and a region of
contraction ( @xmath ). The variable @xmath is given by ( 3.65 ) which
here specializes to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.176)
  -- -------- -- ---------

On using ( 3.172 ) to eliminate @xmath , we find that @xmath on the
plane

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.177)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Equation ( 3.177 ) then divides the state space into a region of
acceleration ( @xmath ) and a region of deceleration ( @xmath ) as
follows:

  ------------------------ ----------
  Region of acceleration   @xmath ,
  Region of deceleration   @xmath .
  ------------------------ ----------

It follows from the general discussion in section 3.2.3 that there are
two conserved quantities for the @xmath FL universes, defined by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.178)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Using ( 3.172 ) we can eliminate @xmath from these equations and hence
obtain @xmath and @xmath in terms of @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . The
values of @xmath and @xmath at the Einstein static equilibrium points
@xmath are denoted @xmath and @xmath and are obtained on substituting (
3.177 ) into ( 3.178 ). We have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.179)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.180)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

The orbits of typical models are described by the equations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.181)
  -- -------- -- ---------

i.e. the orbits are the intersections of these two families of surfaces
in the state space. As a special case the flat universes satisfy @xmath
( i.e. @xmath ) and then the equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.182)
  -- -------- -- ---------

describes the orbits in the invariant set @xmath and can be used to
numerically sketch them, as in figure 3.5 .

###### Discussion:

Knowing the past attractor @xmath and the future attractor @xmath one
can visualize the orbits of typical universes. For example, the orbits
of ever-expanding models join @xmath to @xmath . The models will differ
qualitatively depending on whether they come close to @xmath ( @xmath in
a neighbourhood of @xmath ) and whether they come close to the Milne set
( @xmath ) or to the surfaces @xmath , in which case there will be an
epoch in which spatial curvature is dominant ( i.e. @xmath ). One can
determine the points in state space at which @xmath and @xmath attain a
maximum value, as follows. If @xmath , it follows from ( 3.36 ) and (
3.69 ) that @xmath and @xmath are simultaneously extremal. Since in an
ever-expanding model @xmath is extremal when @xmath , we conclude that
@xmath is extremal on the plane given by ( 3.177 ). The matter variable
@xmath will attain a maximum when @xmath , which implies @xmath , as
follows from ( 3.64 ) and ( 3.65 ). After substituting ( 3.172 ) to
eliminate the @xmath term in ( 3.176 ), we conclude that @xmath will
attain a maximum on the plane

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.183)
  -- -------- -- ---------

One can then determine the dependence of @xmath on @xmath explicitly
from ( 3.172 ), ( 3.178 ) and ( 3.183 ), as follows:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.184)
  -- -------- -- ---------

#### 3.4.2 A Model of the Physical Universe

In this section we discuss the @xmath FL universes as viable models for
the large scale dynamical behaviour of the physical universe. Current
observations of distant galaxies, type @xmath supernovae and the cosmic
microwave background radiation support the following conclusions:

1.  The universe is expanding in the present epoch ( @xmath ).

2.  The universe is accelerating in the present epoch ( @xmath ).

3.  The early universe was radiation-dominated (hot big-bang).

4.  Pressure-free matter (baryonic matter and dark matter) is
    dynamically significant in the present epoch.

5.  The spatial geometry is close to flatness in the present epoch.

These conclusions suggest modelling the physical universe as an @xmath
FL cosmology, with observational parameters

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.185)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Equations ( 3.131 )-( 3.133 ) limit the number of independent quantities
in this set to four, as expected for an @xmath model. Values for these
parameters have been determined using observations, such as high
redshift galaxy surveys (for example, by 2dF and SDSS; see Spergel et
al. (2006) for detailed references) and analyses of the power spectrum
of the cosmic microwave background (for example, by WMAP). We refer the
reader to Spergel et al. (2006) and Tegmark et al. (2004) for an
analysis of recent observational data, leading to the following values:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.186)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.187)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.188)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.189)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.190)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

Using the observational values ( 3.186 )-( 3.190 ), one can apply ( 3.63
)-( 3.65 ) and ( 3.69 )-( 3.71 ) to numerically obtain the past and
future behaviour of all matter quantities @xmath and the curvature
indicator @xmath . We present the results of one such numerical
simulation in figure 3.6 , along with computed epochs of note.

The conserved quantities in the @xmath universe, as given by ( 3.178 ),
can be expressed in terms of the density parameters as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.191)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.192)
  -- -------- -- ---------

(see ( 3.149 ) and ( 3.150 )). Then using ( 3.187 )-( 3.190 ), we obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.193)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.194)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The values of these conserved quantities, which were fixed at the end of
the inflationary epoch, determine a small subset of @xmath universes
that can potentially describe the real universe. The value of @xmath
ensures the occurrence of a matter-dominated epoch that is sufficiently
long, but not too long (see equation ( 3.184 )). The value of @xmath
ensures that @xmath is close to @xmath in the past and also into the
future.

### 3.5 Explicit FL Cosmologies

In this section we give a unified description of the known solutions of
the Friedmann DE that can be expressed in terms of elementary functions,
for 1-fluid and 2-fluid FL cosmologies. In these cases, the Friedmann DE
can be transformed to the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.195)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a quadratic function in @xmath , @xmath is a
dimensionless mass parameter and @xmath is the curvature indicator. Here
@xmath is a function of the length scale factor @xmath and the variable
@xmath is either proportional to conformal time @xmath (in the case
@xmath ) or proportional to clock time @xmath (in the case @xmath ).

Recall that the @xmath -fluid Friedmann equation can be written as a DE
of the form ( 3.110 ), reproduced here for convenience:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.196)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We are primarily interested in expanding models, which begin at a
big-bang singularity, i.e. the length scale satisfies @xmath at some
time @xmath , and @xmath in some interval. Since the DE ( 3.196 ) is
autonomous, it is invariant under the change @xmath . We will use this
freedom to set @xmath , thereby fixing the constant of integration that
arises in solving ( 3.196 ). We will thus solve ( 3.196 ) subject to the
requirement @xmath and the initial condition

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.197)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Using conformal time ( D.1 ), equation ( 3.196 ) becomes a first order
ODE for @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.198)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The solution @xmath can in principle be expressed in terms of clock time
@xmath using the equation ( D.1 ). As with ( 3.196 ), when solving (
3.198 ) for @xmath , we will impose the requirement @xmath and the
initial condition

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.199)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In the following sections we consider five classes of models in which
either ( 3.196 ) or ( 3.198 ) can be transformed into ( 3.195 ). The
solution of ( 3.195 ) subject to the requirement @xmath and the initial
condition @xmath is given in Appendix C . In each case, we give the
solution for @xmath or @xmath and note that the corresponding
expressions for the energy densities and pressure are given by equation
( 3.15 ), ( 3.17 ) and ( 3.114 ).

#### 3.5.1 Single Fluid FL Cosmologies

In this case we consider solutions to the Friedmann equation with @xmath
, @xmath and arbitrary curvature. We choose the conformal factor to be
@xmath . The Friedmann DE ( 3.198 ) assumes the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.200)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We perform the change of variable

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.201)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.202)
  -- -------- -- ---------

so as to obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.203)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Then from ( C.3 ) and ( C.4 ), the solution is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.204)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.205)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Thus,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.206)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Using ( 3.114 ), the energy density is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.207)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This solution, for arbitrary @xmath , was first given by Harrison (1967)
(see equations (152), (18) and (32) in Harrison (1967), for open, flat
and closed models, respectively). Specific cases were discovered
earlier, however. Friedmann (1922) gave this solution in the case of
dust and positive curvature ( i.e. @xmath and @xmath ) and Tolman (1931)
gave this solution in the case of radiation and positive curvature (
i.e. @xmath and @xmath ).

These solutions describe two qualitatively different classes of models:
ever-expanding models if @xmath or @xmath , and recollapsing models if
@xmath . In this case, it follows from ( 3.205 ) and ( 3.206 ) that
recollapse ( i.e. @xmath as @xmath ) will occur at

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.208)
  -- -------- -- ---------

For flat FL ( @xmath ) we can obtain @xmath explicitly by integrating (
3.196 ) with @xmath and @xmath . The result is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.209)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The parameter @xmath is not essential, since by rescaling @xmath it can
be assigned any value. Equation ( 3.209 ) thus represents the unique
flat FL universe with a single fluid. ¹⁷ ¹⁷ 17 That ( 3.209 ) does
define a unique solution is confirmed by the fact that the physical
quantities @xmath and @xmath do not depend on @xmath , being given by

@xmath

on using ( 3.9 ), ( 3.32 ) and the fact that @xmath .

In the case of radiation ( @xmath , @xmath ) one can integrate ( D.1 )
to obtain,

  -- -- -- ---------
           (3.210)
  -- -- -- ---------

Substituting back into ( 3.204 ) and rearranging yields

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.211)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We note that the second term here represents the contribution to the
solution from spatial curvature, i.e. the drift from flat FL. If @xmath
, the limit @xmath , gives the Milne solution (given in section 3.1.2 ,
equation ( 3.28 )).

In the case of dust ( @xmath , @xmath ) one can integrate ( D.1 ) in
closed form, but cannot invert the expression in terms of elementary
functions. In this case @xmath and @xmath are related by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.212)
  -- -------- -- ---------

#### 3.5.2 FL Vacuum Cosmologies

In this case we solve the Friedmann equation where the only fluid
component is a cosmological constant, i.e. @xmath , @xmath . We choose
the conformal factor to be @xmath , which leads to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.213)
  -- -------- -- ---------

(see equation ( 3.111 )). The Friedmann equation ( 3.196 ) in this case
is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.214)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We perform the change of variable

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.215)
  -- -------- -- ---------

so as to obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.216)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This DE can only be solved subject to @xmath and @xmath in the case of
open FL, with the solution given by ( C.3 ). For the case of
non-negative curvature, we instead require that @xmath and that @xmath
is increasing for all @xmath . It follows that ( 3.216 ) has a unique
solution in each case, leading to

  -- -- -- ---------
           (3.217)
  -- -- -- ---------

where @xmath is given by ( 3.213 ). The energy density is constant and
given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.218)
  -- -------- -- ---------

These solutions were first given by Robertson (1933), de Sitter (1917)
and Lanczos (1922) in the case of negative, zero and positive curvature,
respectively. They correspond to the orbits @xmath for @xmath , @xmath
for @xmath and @xmath for @xmath , along the 1-fluid cosmological
constant manifold in figure 3.3 . In the case of flat FL, ( 3.217 )
gives the de Sitter solution, described in section section 3.1.2 ,
equation ( 3.27 ).

Often, in the case of the de Sitter solution, it is preferrable to use
conformal time instead of clock time. In particular, when @xmath this
choice of time variable is defined on an interval @xmath (see Appendix D
). Upon defining

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.219)
  -- -------- -- ---------

the length scale ( 3.217 ) for a flat background is simply

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.220)
  -- -------- -- ---------

#### 3.5.3 Flat FL with a Single Fluid and @xmath

In this case we solve the Friedmann equation with @xmath , @xmath
arbitrary, @xmath and zero curvature ( i.e. @xmath ). We choose the
conformal factor to be @xmath , which leads to ( 3.213 ). As described
in section 3.2.2 , we can use the freedom to scale @xmath to set @xmath
. The Friedmann equation ( 3.196 ) then takes the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.221)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We apply the change of variable

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.222)
  -- -------- -- ---------

so as to write ( 3.196 ) as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.223)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Then using ( C.3 ), we obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.224)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and so

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.225)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Using ( 3.114 ), the energy density is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.226)
  -- -------- -- ---------

These solutions were first given by Harrison (1967) in equation (23).
They represent ever-expanding models and correspond to the orbit @xmath
along the @xmath invariant set, as in figure 3.3 .

#### 3.5.4 FL Cosmologies with Radiation and Dust (@xmath-Universes)

In this case we solve the Friedmann equation with @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath . We choose @xmath as the conformal parameter. Then, by ( 3.113
), the single mass parameter is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.227)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The Friedmann equation ( 3.198 ) assumes the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.228)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We apply the change of variable

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.229)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which gives

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.230)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Using ( C.3 ) and ( C.4 ), the solution is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.231)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and so

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.232)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is given by ( 3.205 ). Using ( 3.114 ), the energy density
is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.233)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In this case, one can integrate ( D.1 ) so as to obtain an expression
for the clock time @xmath , but cannot invert this expression to obtain
@xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.234)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The solution ( 3.232 ) contains the one-fluid dust and radiation
solutions given in ( 3.206 ) as special cases. One can see this by
writing ( 3.232 ) in terms of parameters @xmath and @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.235)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and letting @xmath or @xmath .

These solutions were first given ¹⁸ ¹⁸ 18 Harrison reports that in the
case @xmath this solution was given by Lemaître (1927), but we have not
verified this reference. by Chernin (1966). They describe all orbits in
the state space for @xmath -universes with @xmath in some epoch (see
figure 3.1 ) and hence describe two qualitatively different classes of
models: ever-expanding models if @xmath (the orbits @xmath ) or @xmath
(the orbit @xmath ) and recollapsing models if @xmath (the orbits @xmath
). The dimensionless parameter @xmath determines key physical properties
of the models. First, it determines the epoch of matter-radiation
equality ( @xmath ) according to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.236)
  -- -------- -- ---------

as follows from ( 3.233 ). Second, for recollapsing models, @xmath
determines the time of recollapse, according to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.237)
  -- -------- -- ---------

as follows from ( 3.232 ).

#### 3.5.5 FL Cosmologies with Radiation and @xmath (@xmath-Universes)

In this case we solve the Friedmann equation with @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath and arbitrary curvature. We choose the conformal factor to be
@xmath so that ( 3.213 ) holds. Then, by ( 3.113 ), the single mass
parameter is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.238)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The Friedmann equation ( 3.196 ) then takes the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.239)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Upon making a change of variable according to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.240)
  -- -------- -- ---------

we obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.241)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Using ( C.3 ), the solution is

  -- -- -- ---------
           (3.242)
  -- -- -- ---------

and so

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.243)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Using ( 3.114 ), the energy density is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.244)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The solution ( 3.243 ) contains the @xmath vacuum solutions given in (
3.217 ) and the one-fluid radiation solution given in ( 3.211 ) as
special cases. One can see this by writing ( 3.243 ) in terms of
parameters @xmath and @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.245)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and letting @xmath or @xmath . Also, in the case of zero curvature (
@xmath ), ( 3.243 ) reduces to ( 3.225 ) with @xmath .

This solution was first given by Harrison (1967) (see equations (59) and
(38), for the case of negative ( @xmath ) and positive ( @xmath )
curvature, respectively). It describes all orbits in the state space for
@xmath -universes with @xmath in some epoch (see figure 3.2 ) and an
initial singularity. Hence, this solution describes both ever-expanding
models and recollapsing models. The parameter @xmath determines key
physical properties of the models. First, it determines the epoch of
radiation-cosmological constant equality ( @xmath ) according to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.246)
  -- -------- -- ---------

as follows from ( 3.213 ) and ( 3.244 ). Second, for recollapsing
models, @xmath determines the time of recollapse according to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.247)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This result follows upon rewriting ( 3.243 ) using standard hyperbolic
identities as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.248)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We note that at the critical value of @xmath , denoted @xmath and given
by @xmath , the solution ( 3.243 ) simplifies to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.249)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This solution is future asymptotic to the Einstein static solution and
corresponds to the orbit @xmath in figure 3.2 .

#### 3.5.6 Explicit Solutions in Terms of Observational Parameters

In sections 3.5.1 - 3.5.5 , we have presented the explicit solutions
using intrinsic parameters, namely, a conformal factor @xmath , the
curvature indicator @xmath and, for the 2-fluid solutions with non-zero
curvature, a dimensionless mass parameter @xmath , which describes the
relative significance of the two fluids.

In order to link with observations it is desirable to write the
solutions in terms of the observational parameters. In order to do so we
need to use the formula that relates the intrinsic parameters @xmath to
the observational parameters, derived in section 3.2.2 . In the case of
@xmath , we can use equations ( 3.123 ) and ( 3.137 ) to write

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.250)
  -- -------- -- ---------

One can think of ( 3.250 ) as relating @xmath , the length scale
determined by the @xmath fluid, to @xmath , the length scale determined
by the spatial curvature. In particular, we will need the following
special cases of ( 3.250 ):

  -- -------- -------- -- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath         (3.251)
     @xmath   @xmath         (3.252)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- ---------

Note that the Friedmann equation ( 3.36 ), evaluated at @xmath gives

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.253)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the total density parameter evaluated at @xmath . In the
case of a cosmological constant ( i.e. @xmath ), we can obtain an
expression for @xmath directly from ( 3.137 ), as follows:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.254)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In the case of @xmath and @xmath , we use the freedom to scale @xmath in
order to set @xmath equal to @xmath . Then, as a result of ( 3.137 ),
the length scale @xmath is determined explicitly in terms of @xmath and
@xmath according to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.255)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The intrinsic parameters @xmath are then obtained via ( 3.137 ).

There is no work to be done in writing the densities in observational
form, since they are given in general by equation ( 3.125 ), which we
repeat for convenience:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.256)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath .

In order to illustrate this process we give the length scale function
for the @xmath -universes in terms of the observational parameters. We
first rewrite @xmath in ( 3.232 ) in terms of @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.257)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Then ( 3.251 ) and ( 3.252 ) immediately give

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.258)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath . Then @xmath gives the @xmath -universe and @xmath gives
the @xmath -universe. Peacock (1999) refers to the terms

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

as the “dimensionless masses” (p79), when discussing RDC-universes. Note
that these quantities are closely related to those given in ( 3.251 )
and ( 3.252 ), upon applying ( 3.253 ). These quantities also appear in
the DC- and RC-universes as given by Coles and Lucchin (1995) (see p39,
eq (2.4.2) for dust in terms of @xmath and p41, eq (2.5.2) for radiation
in terms of @xmath ).

### 3.6 Discussion

We summarize the principal features of the dynamics of @xmath -fluid FL
universes.

-   @xmath -fluid FL universes have at most one epoch of expansion (
    @xmath ) and at most one epoch of acceleration ( @xmath , or
    equivalently, @xmath ). These results depend crucially on the
    assumption that the fluids are non-interacting. We refer to Tolman
    (1934), p402 and p429-431, and to Clifton and Barrow (2007) for a
    discussion of models in which this assumption is not made.

-   On approach to a singularity (either initial or final, @xmath ) the
    @xmath -fluid is dominant ( i.e. @xmath ) and the matter content
    dominates the spatial curvature ( @xmath , @xmath ). In a typical
    ever-expanding model ( @xmath ) the @xmath -fluid is dominant (
    @xmath ), and the matter content dominates the spatial curvature if
    and only if @xmath .

-   The @xmath -fluid FL cosmologies admit @xmath conserved quantities
    formed from the density parameters @xmath . In particular, they
    admit one curvature quantity and @xmath matter quantities.

We now comment on an important difference between @xmath -fluid FL
cosmologies with @xmath and @xmath -fluid cosmologies. For a @xmath
-fluid FL model, there are two essential parameters, a conformal
parameter @xmath and a mass parameter @xmath , or equivalently, two
observational parameters @xmath and @xmath . There is also one conserved
quantity @xmath that keeps track of the spatial curvature. For a @xmath
-fluid FL model there is an additional mass parameter @xmath , and hence
three observational parameters @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . There is
also a second conserved quantity @xmath . The new dynamical feature that
arises in generalizing from a @xmath -fluid model to a @xmath -fluid
model relates to the intermediate dynamics. In an ever-expanding 3-fluid
model the additional degree of freedom is the maximum value attained by
@xmath , which indicates the extent to which fluid- @xmath becomes
dominant during the evolution (recall that fluid- @xmath is dominant at
early times ( @xmath ) and fluid- @xmath is dominant at late times (
@xmath )). In an @xmath -model of the physical universe, the maximum
value of @xmath is close to unity, which ensures that there is an
extended matter-dominated epoch.

The dynamical systems analysis of the @xmath -fluid FL universes leads
to an interesting conclusion regarding the behaviour of the spatial
curvature, as follows. For any @xmath , there is an open set of @xmath
-fluid FL universes with @xmath whose spatial curvature scalar @xmath
satisfies @xmath throughout the evolution. In other words, if @xmath ,
in particular, if fluid @xmath is a cosmological constant, the total
matter-energy content “controls” the spatial curvature throughout the
evolution. This result is a consequence of the fact that generic
ever-expanding models satisfy @xmath as @xmath and since @xmath , @xmath
as @xmath . It follows that @xmath attains a maximum value @xmath which
depends on the orbit in question. By restricting to orbits that lie
within a sufficiently small neighbourhood of the flat FL invariant set
@xmath , the value @xmath can be made arbitrarily small. The above
result has been found using different methods by Lake (2005), for @xmath
FL universes. He indicates that the result will also hold for @xmath
universes (see also Lake (2006)). Lake comments on the significance of
this result in connection with the so-called flatness problem (Lake
(2005)).

One of the main results of this chapter is the analysis of the @xmath FL
universes and the comparisons with observations. Discussion of these
models dates back to the 1930’s. Our analysis is novel in that it gives
new insight into the dynamics of these models, by representing the
evolution as orbits in a compact state space. We now give a brief survey
of previous work on these models.

Tolman (1934) gives the Friedmann equation for closed @xmath universes
(equation (106.3), p408) and states that de Sitter has studied the
integration of this equation (de Sitter (1930), (1931), not readily
available). He gives the special solutions of this DE that represent
universes that are past or future asymptotic to the Einstein static
universe, in the form @xmath [equations (161.8) and (161.4)].

Coquereaux and Grossman (1982) give a detailed qualitative discussion of
the Friedmann equation for closed @xmath -universes using elliptic and
Weierstrass functions. Debrowski and Stelmach (1986) extend the analysis
to open @xmath -universes. They give an explicit solution in terms of
elementary functions when the parameters are suitably restricted.

The work that is closest to ours is that of Ehlers and Rinder (1989),
who give a dynamical systems analysis of @xmath -universes, using
Hubble-normalized variables. They give the explicit expressions for the
density parameters as functions of the scale factor [equation (19)] and
also show the existence of two conserved quantities [equation (29)].
Their state space representation is inevitably incomplete since the
Hubble-normalized variables are undefined at the instant of maximum
expansion in recollapsing and bouncing models.

## Chapter 4 Perturbations of FL Models

The high degree of isotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB),
when combined with the Copernican Principle, provides strong support for
the belief that the large scale structure of the observable universe is
very well described by the Friedmann-Lemaître universes, which are
exactly isotropic and spatially homogeneous. The real universe is, of
course, not exactly isotropic and spatially homogeneous, since there is
complex structure associated with the observed distribution of galaxies,
the overall expansion may not be exactly isotropic, and there may be
primordial gravitational waves. But the current belief of most
cosmologists is that the deviations from an exact FL cosmological model
are sufficiently small that they can be described by considering linear
perturbations of the FL models.

### 4.1 Historical Development

In this section we briefly discuss the history of the theory of linear
perturbations of FL cosmologies. There are two main approaches, which we
shall refer to as the metric approach and the geometrical approach .

#### 4.1.1 Metric Approach

The metric approach to perturbations of the FL models was introduced by
Lifshitz (1946) and subsequently discussed in greater detail by Lifshitz
and Khalatnikov (1963). In the metric approach, one distinguishes a
background spacetime , which is a FL model, and a perturbed spacetime ,
which represents the physical universe. The metric for the perturbed
spacetime is written in the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the metric of the FL model and @xmath is a small
perturbation, i.e. @xmath . The fluid 4-velocity and energy density in
the perturbed spacetime are likewise written in the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.2)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

The density contrast is defined by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

##### The problem of gauge

In defining a perturbation, one is effectively establishing a one-to-one
correspondence between points in the physical spacetime and points in
the background spacetime. However, this correspondence is not unique:
one may make an infinitesimal change in the correspondence keeping the
background coordinates fixed. Such a transformation is called a gauge
transformation . A quantity that is unchanged by an infinitesimal gauge
transformation is said to be gauge-invariant . We recommend Ellis and
Bruni (1989) for a detailed explanation of gauge-invariance.

The problem of gauge invariance has plagued the study of linear
perturbations since the pioneering work of Lifshitz (1946), resulting in
authors publishing contradictory predictions on the behaviour of
perturbations of FL cosmologies. The reason is that the metric
perturbation @xmath , the velocity perturbation @xmath and the density
contrast @xmath are not gauge-invariant quantities, and hence their time
evolution can depend on the choice of gauge.

A result due to Stewart and Walker (1974) gives a useful criteria for
identifying gauge-invariant quantities:

###### Theorem 4.1.1 (Stewart-Walker Lemma)

Let @xmath be a tensor field on a background spacetime and let @xmath be
the corresponding tensor on a perturbed spacetime. If @xmath then @xmath
is gauge-invariant.

In 1980 Bardeen reformulated the metric approach using gauge-invariant
variables. He did not make use of the Stewart-Walker Lemma in choosing
the gauge-invariant variables. Instead, he wrote out the transformation
laws for the perturbations @xmath , @xmath and @xmath under an
infinitesimal gauge transformation and then, by inspection, formed
linear combinations of the perturbations and their derivatives that were
invariant.

This approach placed the analysis of perturbations of Friedmann-Lemaître
models on a sounder mathematical foundation and has been used in much
subsequent research. ¹ ¹ 1 We refer to Mukhanov (2005) as a recent text
that uses a simplified version of the Bardeen approach, restricting
considerations to perturbations of flat FL (see chapter 7).
Nevertheless, the metric approach still possesses several shortcomings:

1.  First, it is not clear what physical quantities Bardeen’s
    gauge-invariant quantities correspond to. Indeed, a gauge-invariant
    quantity can have different physical interpretations in different
    gauges. The most important ambiguity concerns the density contrast
    @xmath , as defined by ( 4.4 ). Bardeen defines two gauge-invariant
    quantities in terms of @xmath , denoted by @xmath and @xmath . The
    first equals the density contrast @xmath when one uses the so-called
    co-moving gauge, while the second equals @xmath in the so-called
    Newtonian gauge (see Bardeen 1980, p22).

2.  Second, as emphasized by Hawking (1966), the metric tensor is not a
    physically significant quantity since one cannot measure it
    directly.

#### 4.1.2 Geometrical Approach

The geometrical approach has its origins in a paper by Hawking (1966).
Instead of using the components of a perturbed metric as basic
variables, he proposed using the evolution equations for the kinematic
quantities, the Weyl curvature and the matter density to study how
perturbations evolve. Although this paper initiated a significant new
approach to studying linear perturbations of FL, the analysis of density
perturbations was flawed and the paper had little impact. Subsequently,
motivated by Hawking’s paper, Lyth and Mukherjee (1988) used the
evolution equations for @xmath and @xmath to study density perturbations
in an FL cosmology, although they did not do so in a fully
gauge-invariant way. The decisive step was taken by Ellis & Bruni
(1989), when they proposed using the spatial gradient of the matter
density ( @xmath ) as the basic variable to describe density
perturbations. Unlike the density contrast @xmath , the spatial gradient
is a gauge-invariant quantity by the Stewart-Walker lemma, since it is
zero in any FL model (see proposition 2.1.4 ). The first comprehensive
discussion of the geometrical approach was given by Bruni, Dunsby and
Ellis (1992) ² ² 2 The name “geometrical approach” was introduced in
this reference. This approach is also referred to as “the
gauge-invariant and covariant (GIC) approach”. . They also related the
Bardeen approach to the geometrical approach, and gave clear physical
interpretations of his gauge-invariant variables.

In this chapter we give an introduction to the geometrical approach to
linear perturbations of FL models.

### 4.2 The Linearized Einstein Field Equations

The geometrical approach is based on the conviction that one should use
variables that have a direct physical or geometric meaning, and are both
coordinate-independent and gauge-invariant. One thus uses tensorial
quantities that are identically zero in an FL universe, and hence
gauge-invariant, on account of the Stewart-Walker lemma.

We shall see that a complete set of tensorial quantities is the
following:

  ------ ----------------------------------- -----------------
  i)     The density and Hubble gradients:   @xmath , @xmath
  ii)    The fluid kinematic quantities:     @xmath , @xmath
  iii)   The Weyl curvature:                 @xmath , @xmath
  ------ ----------------------------------- -----------------

These variables have two additional advantages:

1.  they directly describe the deviation of the physical universe from
    an idealized FL universe, and

2.  they are, in principle, observable, when normalized to be
    dimensionless using a power of @xmath . We refer in particular to
    the fundamental paper of Sachs and Wolfe (1967), who analyzed the
    observations of distant galaxies from this point of view, and
    Maartens et al. (1995b), who used the cosmic microwave background
    observations to bound these quantities.

In the geometrical approach one thus replaces the EFEs for the metric
tensor components by the equivalent system of evolution equations and
constraints, satisfied by the tensorial quantities i)-iii), as given in
Appendix A .

For simplicity we will assume the matter content consists of a perfect
fluid with barotropic equation of state @xmath and a cosmological
constant @xmath . We will use the standard notation,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the speed of sound.

#### 4.2.1 The Linearization Process

In order to derive the governing equations for linear perturbations of a
FL cosmology, we must distinguish between quantities which are non-zero
in the background (referred to as zero-order quantities ) and those
which are zero in the background (referred to as first-order quantities
). For a FL background, the zero-order quantities are

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

It follows from propositions 2.1.1 - 2.1.4 that the quantities

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

are first order. For sake of brevity, we define

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

We note that the acceleration @xmath is not an independent quantity,
since it can be expressed in terms of the density gradient @xmath via (
A.17 ), on using ( 4.5 ) and ( 4.8 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

The evolution equations for the zero-order quantities are simply the
evolution equations for a FL cosmology with a single fluid and
cosmological constant, given by ( 3.5 ) and ( 3.6 ), with @xmath
replaced by @xmath and @xmath by @xmath to make the cosmological
constant explicit. We also include the evolution equation for @xmath ,
which follows from ( 4.12 ) and ( 4.5 ).

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

###### Note:

The Friedmann equation ( 3.8 ) plays an auxiliary role in that if @xmath
, it serves to express @xmath in terms of the zero-order quantities. We
use ( 3.11 ) to write ( 3.8 ) as follows:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

The evolution equations for the first order quantities are obtained from
the general system of evolution equations and constraints in Appendix A
, by a process of linearization. There are three aspects to the
linearization procedure :

1.  Drop all products of the first order quantities ( 4.7 ) and their
    spatial derivatives in the general non-linear evolution equations.

2.  The resulting equations form a coupled system of linear PDEs for the
    first order quantities, whose coefficients depend on the zero order
    quantities. For example, there are terms such as @xmath , @xmath and
    @xmath . The linearization process involves replacing the zeroth
    order quantity by its value in the background FL model in each of
    these products.

3.  The resulting equations also contain the projected spatial covariant
    derivative operator @xmath acting on first order quantities. The
    linearization process involves replacing @xmath , which is defined
    on the physical spacetime, by the corresponding operator on the
    background FL spacetime.

#### 4.2.2 The Linearized Evolution and Constraint Equations

We now derive the governing equations for linearized perturbations by
applying the linearization procedure @xmath to the general system of
evolution equations and constraint equations in Appendix A .

One aspect of the linearization process, namely dealing with the terms
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath involving the spatial derivative of @xmath ,
requires particular attention. First, it follows from ( 4.10 ) and
@xmath that ³ ³ 3 Since @xmath , we can use ( 4.5 ) to write

@xmath

where @xmath is a function of @xmath whose specific form is unimportant.
Then the term @xmath is dropped.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

Second, it follows in a similar manner from ( 4.10 ), ( 4.8 ) and @xmath
that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

Applying ( E.25 ) with @xmath and using ( A.16 ) gives

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

Finally, it again follows from ( 4.10 ) and repeated application of
@xmath that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then the commutation property ( E.18 ) with @xmath and the evolution
equation ( A.16 ) for @xmath leads to

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.19)
  -- -- -- --------

The evolution equations for the first order quantities are now obtained
from ( A.9 ) ( A.10 ), ( A.18 ), ( A.19 ), ( A.25 ) and ( A.26 ) on
applying the linearization procedure @xmath and using ( 4.15 ), ( 4.17 )
and ( 4.19 ) to eliminate terms involving spatial derivatives of @xmath
.

Similarly, constraints on the first-order quantities are obtained on
applying the linearization procedure @xmath to ( A.11 ), ( A.12 ), (
A.13 ), ( A.20 ) and ( A.21 ).

There are two additional constraints involving the curls of the spatial
gradients @xmath and @xmath . Indeed, using ( 4.10 ), ( 4.16 ) and (
4.17 ) leads to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

This equation is in fact a consequence of the main system of evolution
equations and constraints and hence we list it as an auxiliary equation.
There is an analogous equation for @xmath which we shall not need.

###### Comments:

1.  The evolution equations ( 4.20 )-( 4.25 ) and constraints ( 4.26 )-(
    4.30 ) form a closed system of linear first order PDEs for the first
    order quantities ( 4.7 ). The coefficients @xmath , @xmath , @xmath
    and @xmath are zero-order quantities and are evaluated in the
    background FL model. Note that if @xmath the term @xmath in ( 4.21 )
    is given in terms of zero order quantities by the constraint ( 4.14
    ).

2.  It can be shown that the system of evolution equations and
    constraints is consistent: that is, the time derivatives of each
    constraint equation ( 4.26 )-( 4.30 ) are identically satisfied as a
    consequence of the other equations. As a result, once a set of
    initial data is chosen to satisfy the constraint equations, these
    equations will hold at all later times (see Bruni et al. (1992),
    p42).

3.  Equations ( 4.20 )-( 4.25 ) and ( 4.26 )-( 4.30 ) form the basis for
    the geometrical approach to the analysis of linear perturbations of
    FL models with a barotropic perfect fluid and cosmological constant
    as source. They can be extracted from Bruni et al. (1992) by
    specializing their more general equations to the case of a
    barotropic perfect fluid (set @xmath , @xmath and @xmath to zero in
    equations (50)-(54), (57)-(62)). Most authors, however, do not make
    use of the full system of evolution and constraint equations.

### 4.3 Harmonic Decomposition

Before proceeding, we must discuss the fundamental role of spatial
harmonics in the geometrical theory. The harmonic decomposition is
analogous to a Fourier decomposition of a quantity that is defined along
the background 3-spaces. Hence, harmonics are defined so as to be
constant along flow lines ( i.e. , independent of proper time) and
orthogonal to the fluid 4-velocity @xmath . We refer the reader to
Appendix F for a complete discussion of spatial harmonics in the
geometrical approach.

The key idea behind the harmonic decomposition is that a scalar, vector
or tracefree symmetric rank 2 tensor orthogonal to @xmath can be written
as a linear combination of scalar, vector and tensor harmonics with
purely time-dependent coefficients. In the literature it is tacitly
assumed that the harmonics are complete in some appropriate space of
tensor fields.

The expansions are as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.32)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.33)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.34)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

This decomposition has two consequences: Firstly, it decouples the
temporal and spatial dependence of each field, since all coefficients
are purely functions of time and harmonics are constant along flow
lines, i.e. @xmath and @xmath for all harmonics @xmath (see Appendix F
). Second, in the framework of linear perturbation theory, it removes
any co-dependence between scalar, vector and tensor harmonics. As in
Bruni et al. (1992, p51), the summation in ( 4.32 )-( 4.34 ) can be over
a discrete set or an integral over a continuously varying index.

We note that the scalar decomposition ( 4.32 ) is analogous to the
@xmath -dimensional Fourier transform for scalar fields. The vector
decomposition ( 4.33 ) is similarly analogous to the Fourier transform,
except applied to the curl-free (scalar) component and the
divergence-free (vector) component of the vector field. The tensor
decomposition ( 4.34 ) separates the curl-free divergent (scalar)
component, the remaining divergent (vector) component and the
divergence-free (tensor) component of the vector field.

Using this decomposition, it is natural to consider the kinematic
quantities and Weyl tensor components of the real universe to be the
fundamental description of the linear perturbations (since they are each
gauge-invariant, each of these components can be expanded using the
harmonic basis functions).

The decoupling of the perturbation types is extremely important in the
linearized theory since it allows us to consider scalar, vector and
tensor perturbations independently. For each perturbation type, we will
proceed as follows: First, we first define a basic variable . Second, we
use the linearized evolution equations ( 4.11 )-( 4.30 ) to derive a
second order differential equation which describes the evolution of the
basic variable, which we shall call the governing DE . Finally, we use
the linearized evolution and constraint equations to express all
kinematic quantities and Weyl tensor components in terms of the basic
variable, hence providing a complete solution to the linearized
equations for each type of perturbation.

### 4.4 Scalar Perturbations

We first focus on scalar perturbations , which are defined as solutions
of the linearized equations ( 4.11 )-( 4.30 ) that can be expanded in
terms of the scalar harmonics @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , defined by
equations ( F.3 ), ( F.5 ) and ( F.6 ). Following Ellis et al. (1989),
we choose the basic quantity for scalar perturbations to be the
fractional density gradient @xmath , defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

or equivalently, using ( 4.8 ),

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

We also rescale @xmath according to @xmath , i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 4.4.1 The Governing DE

In this section we derive the governing DE for scalar perturbations,
following Ellis et al. (1990) (also see Wainwright and Ellis (1997,
p290-3)). Since we are considering scalar harmonics, we can write

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since ( 4.38 ) and ( F.8 ) imply @xmath , and hence @xmath , ( 4.31 )
gives

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

It follows that equations ( 4.20 ) and ( 4.21 ) decouple from the
remaining linearized evolution equations. Expressing these equations in
terms of the rescaled variables @xmath and @xmath leads to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.40)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.41)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

These equations can be combined to give a second order evolution
equation for @xmath . On differentiating ( 4.40 ) and using ( 4.11 )-(
4.13 ), ( 4.14 ) and ( 4.41 ), we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

We now expand each term in terms of scalar harmonics. The derivatives of
@xmath along the fundamental congruence are obtained by differentiating
( 4.38 ) and noting @xmath (see ( F.10 )), as follows:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

In order to remove the Laplacian term from the evolution equation ( 4.42
), we use the identity ( F.13 ), which can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

On applying ( 4.45 ) and ( 4.46 ) to ( 4.42 ), we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are given by ( 4.43 ) and ( 4.44 ). This is the
governing equation for scalar perturbations, in terms of clock time
@xmath . This equation is equivalent ⁴ ⁴ 4 Bruni et al. (1992) make use
of the scalar quantity @xmath instead of @xmath , defined in this manner
so as to restrict considerations to scalar perturbations without it
being necessary to resort to a harmonic expansion. This choice of scalar
quantity automatically removes all vector harmonic components from
@xmath since vector harmonics are divergence-free by definition ( F.22
). to (73) in Bruni et al. (1992), upon specializing to the case of a
perfect fluid, and (214) in Ellis and van Elst (1998), in the case of
@xmath .

#### 4.4.2 Kinematic Quantities and Weyl Curvature

We now write the kinematic quantities and Weyl curvature in terms of the
density gradient coefficients @xmath and the scalar harmonics @xmath .
Since we are considering scalar harmonics, @xmath and @xmath can be
expanded as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

We can use ( 4.40 ) to express @xmath in terms of @xmath and @xmath ,
and since @xmath it follows from ( 4.26 ) and ( F.16 ) that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

Next, it follows from ( 4.48 ) and ( F.8 ) that @xmath . Hence, using (
4.28 ) we have that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

Expanding @xmath in terms of scalar harmonics via

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

and using ( F.16 ) leads to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

The coefficients @xmath can then be expressed in terms of @xmath via the
constraint ( 4.29 ). We thus obtain the following expressions for the
harmonic coefficients of the non-zero Hubble-normalized first-order
quantities:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.53)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.54)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.55)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

At this stage, we have satisfied all of the linearized evolution
equations and constraint equations except for ( 4.22 ) and ( 4.24 ). We
can now verify that @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , as given by ( 4.38 ), (
4.48 ), ( 4.51 ) and ( 4.53 )-( 4.55 ) satisfy ( 4.22 ) and ( 4.24 )
(via Maple). We have thus established the following result:

###### Proposition 4.4.1

For any solution @xmath of the governing DE ( 4.47 ), the first order
quantities given by ( 4.38 ), ( 4.48 ), ( 4.51 ) and ( 4.53 )-( 4.55 )
satisfy the complete set of linearized evolution and constraint
equations ( 4.20 )-( 4.30 ).

### 4.5 Vector Perturbations

In this section we focus on vector perturbations , defined as solutions
of the linearized equations ( 4.20 )-( 4.30 ) that can be expanded in
terms of the vector harmonics @xmath and @xmath . Vector perturbations
are closely associated with vorticity, and so we choose the basic
quantity for vector perturbations to be the co-moving vorticity vector,
defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 4.5.1 The Governing DE

In this section, we derive the governing DE for vector perturbations. On
differentiating ( 4.56 ) along the fundamental congruence and using (
4.23 ), we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

We expand ( 4.57 ) in terms of the associated vector harmonics @xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

On substituting ( 4.58 ) into ( 4.57 ), we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

This equation is the governing DE for vector perturbations, in terms of
clock time @xmath .

#### 4.5.2 Kinematic Quantities and Weyl Curvature

We now write the kinematic quantities and Weyl curvature in terms of the
co-moving vorticity coefficients @xmath and vector harmonics @xmath . By
the definition of vector perturbations, all quantities can be expanded
in terms of vector harmonics and associated vector harmonics, as
follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath                        (4.60)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

From ( 4.31 ), ( 4.36 ) and ( F.23 ), we can express @xmath in terms of
@xmath , and hence obtain @xmath in terms of @xmath from ( 4.20 ), (
4.36 ) and ( 4.37 ). Further, using ( F.34 ), the divergences of @xmath
, @xmath and @xmath can be written as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.61)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.62)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.63)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

We can now use ( 4.26 ), ( 4.29 ) and ( 4.30 ) to determine the
coefficients @xmath , @xmath and @xmath in terms of @xmath . We thus
obtain the following expressions for the harmonic coefficients of the
first-order quantities:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.64)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.65)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.66)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.67)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.68)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

At this stage, we have satisfied all of the linearized evolution
equations and constraint equations except for ( 4.22 ), ( 4.24 ), ( 4.25
) and ( 4.28 ). We can now verify that @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath
, @xmath and @xmath , as given by ( 4.60 ) and ( 4.64 )-( 4.68 ) satisfy
( 4.22 ), ( 4.24 ), ( 4.25 ) and ( 4.28 ) (via Maple). We have thus
established the following result:

###### Proposition 4.5.1

For any solution @xmath of the governing DE ( 4.59 ), the first order
quantities given by ( 4.60 ) and ( 4.64 )-( 4.68 ) satisfy the complete
set of linearized evolution and constraint equations ( 4.20 )-( 4.30 ).

### 4.6 Tensor Perturbations

In this section we focus on tensor perturbations , defined as solutions
of the linearized equations ( 4.11 )-( 4.30 ) that can be expanded in
terms of the tensor harmonics @xmath . Tensor perturbations are
interpreted as gravitational waves, described by a coupling of the
electric and magnetic Weyl curvature.

As regards to the choice of basic variable, we shall see that for tensor
perturbations the only non-zero first order quantities are @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath . On the grounds of mathematical simplicity we choose
the comoving shear tensor as the basic variable, denoted @xmath and
defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.69)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 4.6.1 The Governing DE

In this section, we derive the governing DE for tensor perturbations. ⁵
⁵ 5 A similar derivation was given by Dunsby et al. (1997). It is a
consequence of applying tensor harmonics that rank two tensors have zero
spatial divergence, i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.70)
  -- -------- -- --------

It then follows from the constraints ( 4.26 ), ( 4.29 ) and ( 4.30 )
that all vector quantities are zero, i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.71)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using ( 4.71 ), the shear evolution equation ( 4.22 ) can be rewritten
in terms of @xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.72)
  -- -------- -- --------

We now use ( 4.24 ) to calculate @xmath , noting that @xmath . We use
the constraint ( 4.28 ) to eliminate @xmath and then apply ( E.31 ) to
the “ @xmath ” term. The result is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.73)
  -- -------- -- --------

We can now combine these equations to give a second order DE for @xmath
(differentiate ( 4.72 ) using ( 4.11 ) and ( 4.73 ), and then use ( 4.72
) to eliminate @xmath from the resulting equation). After expressing the
coefficients of @xmath in terms of the density parameters @xmath and
@xmath (see 3.31 ), we obtain ⁶ ⁶ 6 It should be noted that the
evolution equation (22) given in Dunsby et al. (1997, p1219) contains
two errors. The original equation should instead be written as

@xmath

where @xmath , so as to be consistent with the remainder of that paper.
This equation is then equivalent to ( 4.74 ) for @xmath on recalling
that @xmath and @xmath .

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.74)
  -- -------- -- --------

We now expand @xmath in terms of tensor harmonics according to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.75)
  -- -------- -- --------

Substituting ( 4.75 ) into ( 4.74 ) and using ( F.38 ) yields

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.76)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is the governing equation for tensor perturbations, in terms of
clock time @xmath .

#### 4.6.2 Kinematic Quantities and Weyl Curvature

We now write the kinematic quantities and Weyl curvature in terms of the
dimensionless shear coefficients @xmath , tensor harmonics @xmath and
associated tensor harmonics @xmath . Since ( 4.70 ) confirms that @xmath
, @xmath and @xmath can be expanded in terms of tensor harmonics, we can
write

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.77)
  -- -------- -- --------

where ⁷ ⁷ 7 See definition in section F.3 .

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.78)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then using ( 4.69 ), ( 4.22 ) and ( 4.28 ) we can write @xmath , @xmath
and @xmath in terms of @xmath . We thus obtain the following expressions
for the harmonic coefficients of the non-zero first-order quantities:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.79)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.80)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.81)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

At this stage, we have satisfied all of the linearized evolution
equations and constraint equations except for ( 4.24 ) and ( 4.25 ). We
can now verify that @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , as given by ( 4.77 )
satisfy ( 4.24 ) and ( 4.25 ) (via Maple). We have thus established the
following result:

###### Proposition 4.6.1

For any solution @xmath of the governing DE ( 4.76 ), the first order
quantities given by ( 4.77 ) and ( 4.79 )-( 4.81 ) satisfy the complete
set of linearized evolution and constraint equations ( 4.20 )-( 4.30 ).

### 4.7 Dynamics of the Linear Perturbations: General Features

In this section we discuss the dynamics of the linear perturbations. We
first discuss the importance of conformal time in analyzing
perturbations of FL and rewrite the governing DEs for each perturbation
type in terms of this time variable. Finally, we examine the dependence
of the first-order quantities on the solutions to the governing DEs.

#### 4.7.1 Conformal Time and the Particle Horizon

It is a consequence of propositions 4.4.1 , 4.5.1 and 4.6.1 that the
spatial gradients, kinematic quantities and Weyl tensor components can
be determined directly from the set of solutions of the governing DEs.
As a consequence, we turn our attention to the behaviour of solutions to
these equations.

We make the choice of conformal time @xmath as the independent quantity,
defined in terms of the length scale @xmath and clock time @xmath by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.82)
  -- -------- -- --------

Under this choice of time variable, the Roberson-Walker line element (
1.3 ) can be written in the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.83)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a 3-metric of constant curvature.

Conformal time is directly linked to the notion of the particle horizon
, defined as the boundary of the part of the universe that is visible to
us. In terms of conformal time, the distance to the particle horizon
(see figure 4.1 ) is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.84)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since the wavelength @xmath for a perturbation of mode @xmath at some
fixed time @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.85)
  -- -------- -- --------

then from ( 4.84 ) we obtain the key relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.86)
  -- -------- -- --------

Hence, if @xmath the wavelength of the perturbation mode is large
compared to the distance to the particle horizon (since @xmath ). In
this situation it is customary to say that the perturbation is outside
the horizon . Conversely, if @xmath the wavelength of the perturbation
mode is small compared to the distance to the horizon (since @xmath ).
Similarly, in this situation it is customary to say that the
perturbation is inside the horizon .

The range of the conformal time variable varies depending on the
characteristics of the FL model, as shown in Appendix D . A summary of
the behaviour of conformal time and clock time for each of the generic
classes of FL model with an initial singularity is given below:

  FL Model                                Range of @xmath   Range of @xmath
  --------------------------------------- ----------------- -----------------
  Ever-expanding models, @xmath           @xmath            @xmath
  Ever-expanding models, @xmath           @xmath            @xmath
  Recollapsing models, @xmath arbitrary   @xmath            @xmath

#### 4.7.2 Governing DEs Using Conformal Time

We now present the governing DEs for scalar, vector and tensor
perturbations in terms of conformal time and specialized to a @xmath
-law equation of state, i.e. @xmath . It follows from ( 4.5 ) that

  -- -------- -- --------

The three governing DEs, given by ( 4.47 ), ( 4.59 ) and ( 4.76 ) in
terms of clock time @xmath , assume the following form in terms of
conformal time. The change of variable can be performed simply by using

In the case of vector perturbations, the governing DE ( 4.90 ) can be
integrated directly, on applying ⁸ ⁸ 8 This expression is obtained from
( 3.9 ) on making the change of variable ( 4.88 ).

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.92)
  -- -------- -- --------

We then obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.93)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the case of scalar and tensor perturbations, the second-order
governing DEs can be transformed into normal form by making a change of
dependent variable. In both cases the resulting DE ⁹ ⁹ 9 To the best of
the author’s knowledge, this similarity between tensor and scalar
perturbations has not been noted before. has the following form, in
terms of a constant frequency @xmath and a potential @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.94)
  -- -------- -- --------

The wave number @xmath enters only into the frequency, which also
depends on the curvature index @xmath , and, in the case of scalar
perturbations, on the equation of state. The potential @xmath depends on
the background FL model ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath ). The
specific DEs, given in the table below, are obtained by making the
indicated change of variable in the governing DEs ( 4.89 ) and ( 4.91 ).
In order to simplify the subsequent analysis we use the notation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.95)

as in Bardeen (1980).

###### Note:

Here @xmath is the constant conformal parameter introduced in section
3.2.1 , having dimension @xmath .

###### Remark:

Writing the governing DEs in normal form has several advantages.
Firstly, it gives insight into the qualitative behaviour of the
solutions. In particular, if @xmath the solutions will be approximated
by oscillatory solutions of frequency @xmath , while if @xmath , the
solutions will be approximated by power law solutions. Secondly, if the
background FL model has @xmath , the general solution can be written in
terms of Bessel or Legendre functions, as we now show.

#### 4.7.3 General Solutions for Scalar and Tensor Perturbations with
@xmath

In the case @xmath , the potential @xmath in the governing DEs is given
by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.104)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for both scalar and tensor perturbations (see equations ( 4.99 ) and (
4.103 )). The background solution is ( 3.206 ):

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.105)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.106)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for @xmath . On noting that @xmath , it follows from ( 3.207 ) that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.107)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Thus, using ( 4.105 ) we obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.108)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Observe now that the governing DEs in normal form (equations ( 4.97 )
and ( 4.101 )) coincide with the Bessel DE or the Legendre DE, as given
in Appendix H (see equations ( H.1 )-( H.6 )), with the parameters
determined as follows:

  Curvature   DE Type                  Parameters   
  ----------- ------------------------ ------------ --------
  @xmath      Bessel DE                @xmath       @xmath
  @xmath      Legendre (Toroidal) DE   @xmath       @xmath
  @xmath      Legendre (Conical) DE    @xmath       @xmath

The value of @xmath , as given by ( 4.98 ) and ( 4.102 ) distinguishes
between scalar and tensor perturbations. The solutions of the three DEs
are given by ( H.2 ), ( H.4 ) and ( H.6 ), in terms of Bessel and
Legendre functions. The resulting expressions for @xmath and @xmath ,
obtained from ( 4.96 ), ( 4.100 ) and ( 4.105 ) are listed in the
following table

###### Remark:

The physically important cases, namely when the matter content is dust (
i.e. @xmath , @xmath ) or radiation ( i.e. @xmath , @xmath ) require
comment. For dust, the scalar solution is not valid since @xmath . We
will derive the solution in this case in section 4.8 . The tensor
solution is valid, however, and the relevant Bessel and Legendre
functions are in fact elementary and are given in section 4.8.4 . For
radiation, both the scalar and tensor solutions are elementary. We will
give them in section 4.9 .

One can use asymptotic approximations of the Bessel and Legendre
functions (Appendix H ) to obtain approximate solutions in restricted
regimes.

#### 4.7.4 Functional Dependence of First-Order Quantities

We are interested in describing to what extent a perturbed FL cosmology
deviates from an exact FL cosmology.

It is known that cosmological observations place bounds on the first
order quantities, specifically on dimensionless quantities formed by
dividing the first order quantities by an appropriate power of the
Hubble scalar. The specific quantities are

  -- -- -- -------- -- ---------
           @xmath      (4.114)
           @xmath      (4.115)
           @xmath      (4.116)
  -- -- -- -------- -- ---------

The first analysis of this type was due to Sachs and Wolfe (1967) who
showed that observations of distant galaxies could, in principle, place
bounds on these quantities. More recently, Maartens et al (1995a,b) have
shown that the high isotropy of the CMBR ( @xmath ) places strong bounds
on these quantities. ¹⁰ ¹⁰ 10 The analysis is complicated and subject to
assumptions being imposed on the time derivatives of the multipoles of
the CMBR.

It is natural to use these Hubble-normalized quantities as a measure of
how close the physical model is to an idealized FL model, and we will
thus calculate their time dependence for the three perturbation types. A
growing mode is an indication of an instability in the background FL
model.

We now briefly mention the connection between the geometrical approach
and Bardeen’s gauge-invariant metric approach to cosmological
perturbations (Bardeen (1980)). In Bardeen’s approach, the basic
variables are gauge-invariant linear combinations of the metric
perturbations. However, it turns out that Bardeen’s metric potentials
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath have the same time dependence as certain
expressions formed from the basic variables in the geometrical approach.
It can be shown that ¹¹ ¹¹ 11 This result relies on comparing the
governing DEs for @xmath , @xmath and @xmath with the governing DEs
defined in Bardeen’s approach (Bardeen equation (4.9), (4.13) and
(4.14)) and noting that the paired quantities ( @xmath , @xmath ), (
@xmath , @xmath ) and ( @xmath , @xmath ) satisfy the same evolutions
equation. Equations ( 4.117 )-( 4.118 ) then follow from Bardeen (4.3)
and (4.12).

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.117)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.118)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.119)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

We refer the reader to Bruni et al. (1992, p45-9) for an overview of the
relation between the geometrical framework and Bardeen’s metric
approach.

Using the results in sections 4.4.2 , 4.5.2 and 4.6.2 we can obtain the
dependence of the Hubble-normalized quantities ( 4.114 )-( 4.116 ) on
the basic variables @xmath , @xmath and @xmath in terms of conformal
time. In order to enable comparisons to be made, we also include
Bardeen’s metric potentials @xmath ( 4.117 )-( 4.119 ). These results
are provided in table 4.1 .

### 4.8 Perturbations of FL Models with Pressure-Free Matter

For the case where the background FL model contains dust and possibly a
cosmological constant, the analysis of scalar perturbations simplifies
significantly since one can avoid performing the harmonic decomposition.
The evolution equation ( 4.42 ) for the fractional density gradient
@xmath simplifies to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.120)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Since ( 4.10 ) implies @xmath for a dust background, a short calculation
using ( 1.5 ) and ( 1.18 ) reveals @xmath , and hence that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.121)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Namely, we use the fact that the fluid 4-velocity is a geodesic in the
case of dust. Thus, we can drop the spatial projections from ( 4.120 )
and so obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.122)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Although it follows that @xmath does not depend on the perturbation mode
@xmath , a harmonic decomposition is required in order to obtain
expressions for the shear and electric Weyl tensor (see, for example, (
4.54 ) and ( 4.55 )).

#### 4.8.1 The General Solution in Integral Form for Scalar
Perturbations

A second simplification is that the evolution equation ( 4.122 ) has a
first integral, which we derive as follows, using the spatial gradients
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath .

In the case of dust, the evolution equations, given in ( 4.40 ), ( 4.41
) and ( B.13 ) simplify significantly, and can be written as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.123)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.124)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.125)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

Note that these DEs are not independent, since the 3 spatial gradients
are linearly dependent. This result can be seen upon taking the spatial
gradient of ( 1.43 ) and linearizing so as to obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.126)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Observe that the quantity @xmath , defined by ¹² ¹² 12 Also see Bruni et
al. (1992), eq (38).

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.127)
  -- -------- -- ---------

satisfies

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.128)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We can rewrite ( 4.127 ) in terms of @xmath @xmath using ( 4.123 ), (
4.126 ), ( 3.31 ) and ( 3.35 ), so as to obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.129)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This equation is in fact a first integral of the evolution equation (
4.122 ), since ( 4.122 ) is a consequence of ( 4.123 ) and ( 4.124 ).

On noting that, in the case of dust, ( 4.11 ) can be rewritten as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.130)
  -- -------- -- ---------

we can further simplify ( 4.129 ) to read

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.131)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The solution of ( 4.131 ) is thus

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.132)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for time-independent vectors @xmath and @xmath , with @xmath . For
simplicity, we define

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.133)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and so write ( 4.132 ) as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.134)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In terms of conformal time @xmath , the growing mode @xmath , as given
by ( 4.133 ), reads

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.135)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Equation ( 4.135 ) can often be used to gain insight into the asymptotic
behaviour of dust perturbations. If @xmath or @xmath as @xmath (where
@xmath is allowed), we can rewrite @xmath as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.136)
  -- -------- -- ---------

On applying L’Hôpital’s rule, in the limit as @xmath , we obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.137)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Then ( 4.130 ) gives an expression for the asymptotic behaviour of the
growing mode in terms of zero-order quantities:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.138)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Although the general solution ( 4.133 ) cannot always be obtained in
closed form, one can analyze the asymptotic behaviour of these
solutions. We are primarily interested in three asymptotic epochs,
namely flat FL ( @xmath ), Milne ( @xmath , @xmath ) and de Sitter (
@xmath , @xmath ). The general behaviour of perturbations within these
epochs shall be discussed in detail in section 4.10 .

#### 4.8.2 Scalar Perturbations with @xmath

We now use the general solution ( 4.135 ) to obtain the solution for a
dust background with @xmath . The length scale ( 4.105 ), when
specialized to the case of dust, is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.139)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and the Hubble parameter by @xmath and ( 4.139 ),

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.140)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is defined analogous to @xmath to be

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.141)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for @xmath .

We now consider the case of @xmath separately. In this case, the growing
mode can be determined from ( 4.135 ), ( 4.139 ) and ( 4.140 ), on
integrating

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.142)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This integral is elementary and can be expressed in terms of @xmath and
@xmath after a short calculation:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.143)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It follows from ( 4.107 ) with @xmath that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.144)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which allows us to rewrite the Friedmann equation ( 3.36 ) as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.145)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We can now eliminate the @xmath term in ( 4.143 ), obtaining

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.146)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The solution of ( 4.122 ) for @xmath is then

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.147)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath and @xmath are given by ( 4.139 ) and ( 4.140 ).

In the case of @xmath , the integral ( 4.142 ) evaluates to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.148)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the coefficient @xmath is chosen so as to be asymptotic to the
growing mode solution for @xmath when @xmath . The solution for a flat
FL background is then

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.149)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We depict the growing and decaying mode solutions in figure 4.2 .

We note that the solution ( 4.147 ) can also be derived from the
governing DE ( 4.122 ), upon applying the general solutions ( H.2 ), (
H.34 ) and ( H.35 ).

#### 4.8.3 Scalar Perturbations with @xmath, @xmath

In the case @xmath with flat spatial geometry ( @xmath ), the general
solution ( 4.133 ) can be given in terms of toroidal Legendre functions
with clock time as the time variable, as follows. We transform the
governing DE ( 4.122 ) to normal form by means of the change of variable

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.150)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The result is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.151)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The length scale of the background solution is given by ( 3.225 ). We
calculate @xmath using @xmath . The results are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.152)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.153)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We substitute ( 4.152 ) into ( 4.151 ) and use @xmath as the independent
variable. After applying a standard identity, we obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.154)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This DE is the toroidal Legendre DE ( H.3 ) with @xmath and @xmath whose
solution is given by ( H.4 ). Thus, we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.155)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The second term of this solution is in fact an elementary function due
to the identity ¹³ ¹³ 13 This result is obtained from Abramowitz and
Stegun (1970), equations (8.5.1) and (8.6.16).

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.156)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for @xmath constant. It follows from ( 4.152 ) that ( 4.155 ) can be
rewritten as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.157)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is given by ( 4.153 ). Observe that the second term
corresponds to the second term in the general solution ( 4.132 ).
However, the growing mode in ( 4.157 ) does not correspond to the
growing mode given in the general solution ( 4.132 ), since it diverges
as @xmath (see ( H.39 )). Thus the growing mode @xmath in ( 4.132 ) must
be a linear combination of the two solutions in ( 4.157 ):

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.158)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The growing mode defined in this way will satisfy

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.159)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We depict the growing and decaying mode solutions in figure 4.3 .

#### 4.8.4 Tensor Perturbations for @xmath

The solution for @xmath is obtained in terms of Bessel and Legendre
functions by choosing @xmath in the general solution ( 4.109 ), ( 4.111
) and ( 4.113 ). Since the index has the value @xmath , these solutions
are elementary functions, given by ( H.20 )-( H.25 ). Upon comparing the
functional dependence in each case, we obtain the following unified form
of the solution:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.160)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.161)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.162)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

and @xmath . Here, the coefficients @xmath and @xmath are constants that
depend on @xmath .

Tensor perturbations describe the propagation of gravitational waves,
which are represented by the electric and magnetic Weyl tensor, @xmath
and @xmath . We specialize the solution ( 4.160 ) to @xmath and use (
3.206 ) and @xmath to determine @xmath and @xmath . On applying ( 4.80 )
and ( 4.81 ), we can determine the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath and
@xmath in three asymptotic regimes: The first regime ( @xmath and @xmath
) describes long wavelength perturbations that occur outside the
particle horizon close to the singularity; the second regime ( @xmath
and @xmath ) describes perturbations within the particle horizon close
to the singularity; lastly, the long term behaviour of the perturbation,
when spatial curvature is significant, is described in the third regime
( @xmath ).

           @xmath and @xmath   @xmath and @xmath   @xmath
  -------- ------------------- ------------------- --------
  @xmath   @xmath              @xmath              @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath              @xmath              @xmath

Here @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are arbitrary constants that depend on
@xmath . In the first regime we can see that the tensor perturbations do
not represent gravitational waves since they have a power law dependence
on @xmath . We depict the behaviour of @xmath in figure 4.4 , for three
given choices of @xmath .

### 4.9 Perturbations of Radiation-Filled FL Models

We now derive the general solution of the governing DEs for a radiation
fluid with zero cosmological constant ( @xmath ) in terms of elementary
functions.

The solution for @xmath is obtained by choosing @xmath in the general
solution ( 4.109 ), ( 4.111 ) and ( 4.113 ). Since the index has the
value @xmath , these solutions are elementary functions, given by ( H.14
)-( H.19 ). Upon comparing the functional dependence in each case, we
obtain the following unified form of the solution:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.163)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.164)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.165)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.166)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The coefficients @xmath and @xmath are constants that depend on @xmath .

The solution for @xmath is obtained by choosing @xmath in the general
solution ( 4.109 ), ( 4.111 ) and ( 4.113 ). Since the index has the
value @xmath , these solutions are elementary functions, given by ( H.14
)-( H.19 ). Upon comparing the functional dependence in each case, we
obtain the following unified form of the solution:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.167)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.168)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.169)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

and @xmath . The coefficients @xmath and @xmath are constants that
depend on @xmath .

As with perturbations of a dust background, we specialize the solution (
4.163 ) to @xmath and use ( 3.206 ) and @xmath to determine @xmath and
@xmath . On applying ( 4.80 ) and ( 4.80 ), we can determine the
asymptotic behaviour of @xmath and @xmath in three asymptotic regimes.

           @xmath and @xmath   @xmath and @xmath   @xmath
  -------- ------------------- ------------------- --------
  @xmath   @xmath              @xmath              @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath              @xmath              @xmath

Here @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are arbitrary constants that depend on
@xmath . We depict the behaviour of @xmath in figure 4.5 , for three
given choices of @xmath .

### 4.10 Perturbations in Asymptotic Epochs of FL Models

In this section we give approximate solutions of the governing ODEs for
scalar and tensor perturbations in three asymptotic epochs for FL
cosmologies. We also give the behaviour of the spatial gradients,
kinematic quantities and Weyl tensor components for these approximate
solutions. Further, to facilitate comparisons, we give the Bardeen
(1980) gauge-invariant metric potentials for the approximate solutions.

The three asymptotic epochs are as follows:

###### Flat FL.

The flat FL background is described by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.171)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This solution approximates the dynamics of any FL cosmology with an
initial singularity with cosmological constant and arbitrary curvature
at early times, since these models satisfy

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.172)
  -- -------- -- ---------

(see table 3.2 ).

###### Milne.

The Milne background is described by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.173)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This solution approximates the dynamics of any open FL cosmology with
zero cosmological constant at late times, since these models satisfy

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.174)
  -- -------- -- ---------

(see table 3.2 ).

###### de Sitter.

The de Sitter background is described by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.175)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is defined by ( 3.219 ):

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.176)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This solution approximates the dynamics of any ever-expanding FL
cosmology with cosmological constant and arbitrary curvature at late
times, since these models satisfy

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.177)
  -- -------- -- ---------

(see table 3.2 ).

###### Remark:

The approximate solution for the case of flat FL with @xmath (Table 4.2
) have been given by Goode (1989). To the best of the author’s
knowledge, the other results are new.

#### 4.10.1 The Flat FL Asymptotic Epoch

The solutions of the governing equations in the flat FL background are
obtained by substituting ( 4.171 ) into ( 4.109 ) and ( 4.93 ) and are
given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.178)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.179)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.180)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

In the expressions for @xmath and @xmath we can identify two asymptotic
regimes, namely @xmath and @xmath . The restriction @xmath means that
the perturbation mode corresponding to @xmath is outside the particle
horizon, while @xmath means the perturbation mode is inside the particle
horizon (see section 4.7.1 ). The approximate solutions subject to these
restrictions can be obtained from the asymptotic expressions for the
Bessel functions in Appendix H.4 .

These approximate solutions will also be valid for an open or closed FL
background, for the following reason. If @xmath and @xmath , it follows
that @xmath must satisfy @xmath since @xmath – see ( F.11 ), ( F.32 )
and ( F.43 ). It thus follows from ( 4.172 ) that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.181)
  -- -------- -- ---------

i.e. the spatial curvature is dynamically negligible in the regime
@xmath .

The approximate solutions and the resulting time dependence of the first
order quantities are given in table 4.2 ( @xmath ) and table 4.3 (
@xmath ).

#### 4.10.2 The Milne Asymptotic Epoch

The governing DEs in the Milne background are obtained by substituting (
4.173 ) into ( 4.97 ), ( 4.90 ) and ( 4.101 ) and are given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.182)
     @xmath                        (4.183)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.184)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.185)
  -- -------- -- ---------

holds for scalar perturbations and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.186)
  -- -------- -- ---------

holds for tensor perturbations. For scalar perturbations there are two
cases, namely @xmath and @xmath . The second case includes dust ( i.e.
@xmath , @xmath ), while the first case includes radiation ( i.e. @xmath
, @xmath ). In addition, the condition @xmath is satisfied for all
perfect fluids other than dust ( i.e. @xmath ) provided that the wave
number @xmath is sufficiently large, i.e. @xmath . We will restrict our
considerations to the cases @xmath and dust.

The solutions are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.187)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.188)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.189)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is an arbitrary constant amplitude.

In order to calculate the approximate expression for @xmath we need an
approximate expression for @xmath subject to @xmath . A simple
calculation using ( 3.206 ) and ( 3.207 ) yields the approximate
asymptotic behaviour

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.190)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The approximate solutions and the resulting time dependence of the first
order quantities are given in table 4.4 .

#### 4.10.3 The de Sitter Asymptotic Epoch

The governing DEs in the flat de Sitter background are obtained by
substituting ( 4.175 ) into ( 4.97 ), ( 4.90 ) and ( 4.101 ) and are
given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.191)
     @xmath   @xmath                        (4.192)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.193)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

where the prime @xmath denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath
and @xmath – see ( F.43 ). The solutions to these equations are given by
¹⁴ ¹⁴ 14 Observe that ( 4.191 ) is Bessel’s DE ( H.1 ) in normal form
with @xmath and @xmath , i.e. @xmath .

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.194)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.195)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.196)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

As in the case of the flat FL background, we can distinguish two
regimes, depending on the wave number, i.e. @xmath and @xmath . These
results are valid also for @xmath , but require that @xmath , which
holds for @xmath on account of ( 4.175 ).

In order to calculate the approximate expression for @xmath we need an
approximate expression for @xmath subject to @xmath . A simple
calculation using ( 3.225 ) and ( 3.226 ) yields the approximate
asymptotic behaviour

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.197)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The approximate solutions and the resulting time dependence of the first
order quantities are given in table 4.5 ( @xmath ) and table 4.6 (
@xmath ).

### 4.11 Discussion

We now summarize the principal features of linear perturbations of FL
cosmologies.

1.  For each perturbation type the complete system of linearized
    evolution and constraint equations is reduced to a single ODE for
    the harmonic modes, together with expressions for the
    Hubble-normalized quantities ( 4.114 )-( 4.116 ). Solutions of the
    governing DE for vector perturbations can always be determined
    explicitly in terms of @xmath according to ( 4.93 ).

2.  When written in normal form using conformal time, the governing DEs
    for scalar and tensor perturbations are essentially the same if
    @xmath , i.e. they are governed by the same potential @xmath with a
    different frequency @xmath , but differ significantly if @xmath .

3.  We have given a unified derivation of the known explicit solutions
    of the governing DEs for scalar and tensor perturbations in ( 4.109
    )-( 4.113 ). Solutions are given in terms of Bessel functions if
    @xmath and @xmath with @xmath arbitrary. Solutions are given in
    terms of Legendre functions if @xmath and @xmath with @xmath
    arbitrary. In the case of dust ( @xmath ) and radiation ( @xmath ),
    solutions for all perturbation modes can be written in terms of
    elementary functions.

We now give a brief overview of the behaviour of scalar and tensor
perturbations when the matter content is dust or radiation and possibly
with a cosmological constant.

Scalar perturbations , as described by the spatial density gradient
@xmath , have a growing mode and a decaying mode in the regime @xmath .
For pressure-free matter these two modes persist for all @xmath . The
growing mode is bounded in the Milne regime, i.e. if @xmath and @xmath ,
and in the de Sitter regime, i.e. if @xmath .

For radiation (or more generally if the barotropic index satisfies
@xmath ), scalar perturbations are wavelike in the regime @xmath
(interpreted as sound waves with speed of propagation @xmath ). The
spatial density gradient is wavelike with constant amplitude in the
Milne regime (unbounded if @xmath ) and in the de Sitter regime (with
@xmath ) it has a growing and unbounded mode and a decaying mode (more
generally this occurs if @xmath ).

Tensor perturbations , as described by the electric and magnetic Weyl
curvature, have a growing mode and a decaying mode in the regime @xmath
. In the regime @xmath where @xmath the behaviour is sinusoidal, with
power-law amplitude.

In tables 4.2 - 4.6 we summarize the time-dependence of the
Hubble-normalized kinematic quantities, Hubble-normalized Weyl tensor
components and metric potentials in three asymptotic epochs for FL
cosmologies. Tables 4.2 and 4.3 show clearly that the flat FL model is
unstable, both with respect to long wavelength and short wavelength
perturbations. This instability is not revealed by the gauge invariant
metric potentials. Tables 4.4 - 4.6 show that spatial curvature has a
stabilizing effect, as does the presence of a cosmological constant.

## Appendix A Evolution and Constraint Equations

As discussed in section 1.2.6 , when the Ricci identities ( 1.50 ) and
Bianchi identities ( 1.51 ) are applied to the Einstein field equations
( 1.2 ), we obtain a set of evolution and constraint equations for the
kinematic quantities and Weyl tensor components. For an outline of the
derivation of these equations see Ellis (1973, p24-30) and Ellis and van
Elst (1998, p10-12).

###### Projected Field Equations.

The Einstein field equations ( 1.2 ) can be rewritten as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

We contract ( A.1 ) with @xmath and @xmath and use ( 1.26 ) in order to
obtain the following relations:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (A.2)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (A.3)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (A.4)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (A.5)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

(see Ellis (1973), p24). Using ( 1.30 ) we also obtain two important
relations relating the Riemann curvature tensor and Weyl tensor

###### Spatial Gradients of Zero-Order Quantities.

In order to derive the governing equations for linear perturbations of
FL, it is necessary to derive evolution equations for the spatial
gradients of the matter density @xmath and the Hubble parameter @xmath ,
defined by ( 4.8 ) and ( 4.9 ). By propositions 2.1.4 and 2.1.1 , these
quantities are zero in the background and hence gauge-invariant by the
Stewart-Walker lemma.

We make use of the fact that the Raychaudhuri equation ( A.8 ) can be
rewritten as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

In order to proceed, we require an identity which permits the
interchange of the @xmath derivative and the spatial derivative @xmath
when applied to a scalar field @xmath . A straightforward calculation
using ( 1.18 ) yields

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

for any scalar @xmath (also see equation (92) in Ellis et al. (1990)).

We now derive evolution equations for @xmath and @xmath , following
Ellis and van Elst (1998, p56). Substituting @xmath into ( A.24 ) and
using ( 4.8 ), ( 4.9 ), ( A.16 ) and ( A.17 ) yields the evolution
equation for @xmath . If we instead choose @xmath in ( A.24 ) and use (
4.8 ), ( 4.9 ), ( A.22 ), ( A.16 ) and ( A.17 ) we obtain the evolution
equation for @xmath . The results of these derivations are given as
follows:

## Appendix B Spatial Curvature

In this appendix we introduce the 3-curvature when the fundamental
congruence has non-zero vorticity. This analysis leads to a
generalization of the Gauss equation ( 1.37 ), the 3-Ricci tensor ( 1.39
) and 3-Ricci scalar.

### b.1 The Generalized Gauss Equation

We note that the projected covariant derivative @xmath , defined in (
1.11 ), is a non-commutative operator on the space-time manifold when
vorticity is present, i.e. @xmath . After a short calculation using (
1.5 ), ( 1.11 ) and ( 1.18 ), we obtain

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

We now derive a similar identity for tensors with one or more index.

On projecting ( 1.18 ) orthogonal to @xmath and applying ( 1.11 ), we
obtain

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is defined by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

(see Ellis et al. (1990), eq. (76)).

Upon performing a similar computation as in ( B.1 ) and using ( 1.50 ),
we obtain the expression

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is defined by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

(see Ellis et al. (1990), eq. (79)). We note that this definition
reduces to the 3-Riemann tensor given in ( 1.37 ) when @xmath is
irrotational. A similar identity to ( B.4 ) can be obtained for tensors
with two or more indices, generalized according to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

On contracting ( B.5 ), we can obtain an expression for the spatial
Ricci scalar and trace-free spatial Ricci tensor in terms of the
spacetime quantities from ( B.5 ), incorporating the Weyl tensor through
( 1.30 ) and ( 1.32 ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.7)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.8)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Using the field equations ( 1.2 ) in the form ( A.2 )-( A.5 ) to
eliminate @xmath and @xmath , we obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.9)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.10)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

### b.2 The Spatial Gradient of the 3-Ricci Scalar

The spatial gradient of the 3-Ricci scalar is defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

An evolution equation for @xmath is obtained in the same manner as for
@xmath and @xmath , defined in ( 4.35 ) and ( 4.37 ), respectively. If
we choose @xmath in ( A.24 ) and use ( 4.9 ), ( A.22 ), ( A.16 ) and (
A.17 ) we obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.12)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Further, we can obtain an auxiliary equation describing the evolution of
@xmath from ( B.12 ) and ( 4.19 ), presented here for completeness:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

## Appendix C Solutions of the Friedmann Equation

In this appendix we list the solutions of the three first order
quadratic DEs that arise by transforming the Friedmann DE. In the first
two cases, the solution is uniquely determined by requiring @xmath and
the initial condition

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the third case we require that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -- -------- -------- -- -------
                             
        @xmath   @xmath      (C.3)
        @xmath   @xmath      (C.4)
        @xmath   @xmath      (C.5)
  -- -- -------- -------- -- -------

There are four known cases where the Friedmann equation can be
transformed into the quadratic form ( 3.195 ) via a change of variable:

1.  1-fluid plus spatial curvature.

2.  2-fluid flat FL.

3.  2-fluid FL plus arbitrary curvature. The equation of state
    parameters must satisfy

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (C.6)
      -- -------- -- -------

    where @xmath is constant.

4.  3-fluid FL. The equation of state parameters must satisfy

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (C.7)
      -- -------- -- -------

    where @xmath is constant.

### c.1 Solutions with a Stiff Fluid

There are three known cases where we can obtain a solution to the
Friedmann equation where one fluid is a so-called stiff fluid, i.e.
@xmath . In this section we briefly present each of these solutions.

###### @xmath-Universes.

We choose the conformal parameter to be @xmath , which, on using ( 3.113
), leads to a single mass parameter defined by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

In this case the Friedmann equation reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

We apply the change of variable

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

obtaining

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

Subject to the IC @xmath , the solution is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

or equivalently

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### @xmath-Universes.

We choose the conformal parameter to be @xmath , which, on using ( 3.113
), leads to a single mass parameter defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this case the Friedmann equation reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

We apply the change of variable

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

obtaining

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

Subject to the IC @xmath , the solution is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### @xmath-Universes.

We choose the conformal parameter to be @xmath , which, on using ( 3.113
), leads to two mass parameters defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this case the Friedmann equation reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

We apply the change of variable

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

obtaining

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

Subject to the IC @xmath , the solution is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

### c.2 Existence-Uniqueness for the Friedmann Equation

In this section we prove existence-uniqueness of solutions to the
Friedmann DE ( 3.115 ), given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

for any choice of parameters @xmath , @xmath and subject to the
conditions

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

We can rewrite ( C.24 ) as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath and @xmath , this DE is of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

with

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath , we can rewrite ( C.27 ) as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

The general solution to ( C.29 ) is then, for all @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the antiderivative of the RHS of ( C.29 ). The
requirement that @xmath when @xmath fixes @xmath , and hence gives a
unique solution.

## Appendix D Conformal Time

The conformal time variable @xmath is defined in terms of clock time
@xmath and the length scale @xmath via

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (D.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

Unlike clock time, conformal time is not necessarily unbounded into the
future for ever-expanding models. In fact, the presence or absence of
certain types of fluids determines the behaviour of the conformal time
variable. We present the following theorem:

###### Theorem D.1

Let ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ) be an ever-expanding @xmath -fluid FL
cosmology whose length scale satisfies @xmath and where each fluid
satisfies a linear equation of state ( 3.17 ) with equation of state
parameters @xmath ordered according to @xmath . It follows that @xmath
satisfies the following constraints:

1.  @xmath is bounded below iff @xmath .

2.  @xmath is bounded above iff @xmath .

###### Proof.

It follows from the definition of an ever-expanding model (see section
3.1.6 ) that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (D.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Using the chain rule we expand ( D.1 ) so as to obtain

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (D.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

It then follows from ( D.2 ) and ( D.3 ) that @xmath is a strictly
increasing function of @xmath for @xmath .

Let @xmath and @xmath be the value of conformal time at @xmath and
@xmath , respectively. We now integrate ( D.3 ) over @xmath so as to
obtain

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (D.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

Since @xmath is strictly increasing, we note that @xmath is bounded
above if and only if @xmath is bounded as @xmath . Similarly, we note
that @xmath is bounded below if and only if @xmath is bounded as @xmath
. We now prove the two results separately:

###### (a)

Assume that condition (a) is not met. It then follows from ( 3.196 )
that @xmath a constant @xmath such that @xmath . The integral ( D.4 )
then takes the form

  -- -- -- -------
           (D.5)
  -- -- -- -------

which is unbounded.

If condition (a) is met it then follows from ( 3.196 ) that @xmath
constants @xmath and @xmath such that @xmath . The integral ( D.4 ) then
takes the form

  -- -- -- -------
           (D.6)
  -- -- -- -------

which is bounded.

###### (b)

Assume that condition (b) is not met. It then follows from ( 3.196 )
that @xmath a constant @xmath such that @xmath . The integral ( D.4 )
then takes the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (D.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is unbounded.

If condition (b) is met it then follows from ( 3.196 ) that @xmath
constants @xmath and @xmath such that @xmath . The integral ( D.4 ) then
takes the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (D.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is bounded.

Thus, we conclude that the constraints hold, completing the proof.
@xmath

######

We note that this theorem also holds in the case of closed FL as long as
@xmath , where @xmath is a constant satisfying @xmath . This constraint
prevents models which recollapse or whose length scale tend to a
constant as @xmath .

## Appendix E Covariant Differential Identities

In this appendix, we present a list of useful differential identities
involving the derivative operators used in this thesis. This list
represents an extension of the list given in Ellis et al. (1990)
Appendix A by incorporating identities involving the Laplacian and curl
operators.

###### Zero-order 3-curvature quantities for FL models:

Before proceeding, we must first obtain zero order expressions for the
background curvature. It quickly follows from ( 3.11 ), ( 1.40 ) and (
1.47 ) that, to zero order, the background 3-curvature quantities
satisfy the following relationships:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.1)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.2)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.3)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

We now present a list of linearized identities, derived using ( 1.7 ), (
1.11 ), ( 1.16 )-( 1.17 ), ( B.1 ) and ( B.6 ). In all of the following
relations, we shall assume that @xmath , @xmath and @xmath and all their
derivatives are first order quantities. Further, we assume that @xmath
is symmetric and trace-free.

###### First-order time derivatives:

The following set of linearized identities are used when interchanging
the derivative along the fundamental congruence ( @xmath ) with @xmath ,
@xmath or @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.4)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.5)

  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.16)
     @xmath      (E.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Laplacian identities:

The following linearized identities are used when interchanging the
Laplacian operator @xmath with @xmath or @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.18)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.19)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.21)

###### Curl identities:

Finally, the following linearized identities are used when interchanging
the curl operator @xmath with @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.25)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.26)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.27)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.28)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.29)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Further, we obtain the following linearized identities for the curl of a
curl, in the linearized context:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.30)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.31)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

## Appendix F Covariant Harmonics

In this appendix, we present an overview of general identities and
results related to the covariant harmonics. We extend the results of
Bruni et al. (1992) Appendix B by introducing the notion of associated
vector and tensor harmonics.

As in Hawking (1966), we define the spatial harmonics @xmath as
eigenfunctions of the spatial Laplace-Beltrami operator:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (F.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is known as the wavenumber of the harmonic. Further, using
( F.1 ) we impose that the @xmath quantities are constant in time:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (F.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

See Bruni et al. (1992, Appendix B) for the relation between the metric
harmonics @xmath and the covariant harmonics @xmath . Hereafter, as we
are working in the geometrical formalism, the use of the term harmonics
will refer to the covariant harmonics defined by ( F.1 ) and ( F.2 ).
For the problem at hand, we only require scalar harmonics, vector
harmonics and two-index tensor harmonics (which, for purposes of brevity
will be referred to as tensor harmonics).

We briefly discuss notation for harmonics and quantities derived from
harmonics. The @xmath superscript of the harmonic quantity @xmath
denotes that it is a scalar harmonic. Similarly, we use @xmath and
@xmath to denote vector and tensor harmonics, respectively. It is common
in the literature to drop the wavenumber @xmath when writing a harmonic
quantity, so writing @xmath as @xmath instead. The wavenumber of the
harmonic being used is instead implicitly defined by the equation where
the harmonic appears. Further, here and elsewhere, we shall use @xmath
to denote the whole set of harmonics and the standard quantities
constructed from @xmath : we have scalar harmonics @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath , vector harmonics @xmath , @xmath and tensor harmonics @xmath .

We now give the definitions and properties of each of these three
classes of harmonic types.

### f.1 Scalar Harmonics

Scalar harmonics are defined as solutions of

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (F.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

that satisfy the time-independence constraint

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (F.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

Each scalar harmonics @xmath defines a vector and a trace-free symmetric
tensor via

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (F.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (F.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

Since it follows from ( F.4 ) and ( B.1 ) that @xmath satisfies

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (F.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

it can be quickly shown that @xmath and @xmath satisfy the curl-free
constraint,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (F.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

congruence-orthogonality,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (F.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

and time invariance,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (F.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

We are restricted in our choice of @xmath to the eigenvalues determined
by Lifshitz (1946), which in turn are determined by the spatial
curvature according to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (F.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

We note that it is common to include @xmath as a possibly harmonic mode
in the case of @xmath , but it can be shown via the constraint equation
( 4.29 ) and identity ( F.16 ) that this mode is unphysical. In fact,
this mode is gauge-dependent and associated with the freedom of choice
of the velocity field @xmath .

Some important identities involving the vector quantity @xmath can be
derived using the differential identities in Appendix E and ( F.3 )-(
F.5 ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (F.12)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (F.13)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (F.14)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (F.15)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Similarly, some important identities involving the tensor quantity
@xmath can be derived using the differential identities in appendix E
and ( F.3 )-( F.6 ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (F.16)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (F.17)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (F.18)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (F.19)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (F.20)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

### f.2 Vector Harmonics

Vector harmonics are defined as solutions of

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (F.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is divergence-free and time-independent,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (F.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

Every vector harmonic @xmath defines an associated vector harmonic
@xmath via

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (F.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

which can be shown to satisfy ( F.21 ) and ( F.22 ) using ( E.23 ), (
E.28 ) and ( E.12 ). On taking the curl of ( F.23 ) and applying ( F.21
) and ( E.30 ), we obtain @xmath in terms of @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (F.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

The vector harmonics @xmath and associated vector harmonics @xmath then
define trace-free symmetric tensor quantities via

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (F.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (F.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

These tensor-valued vector harmonics are defined in order to satisfy
zero second divergence,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (F.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

congruence orthogonality,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (F.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

and time invariance,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (F.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

The tensor-valued vector harmonics are related using ( F.25 ), ( F.26 )
and ( E.24 ), as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (F.30)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (F.31)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

As with scalar harmonics, we are restricted in our choice of @xmath to
the eigenvalues determined by Lifshitz (1946), according to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (F.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

Again, it is common to include @xmath as a possibly harmonic mode in the
case of @xmath , but it can be shown via the constraint equation ( A.21
) that this mode is unphysical.

Using the differential identities in Appendix E and ( F.21 )-( F.23 ) we
can derive the following identity for the vector harmonics @xmath and
associated vector harmonics @xmath (in this case, we may replace @xmath
with @xmath to obtain a second identity):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (F.33)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Some identities involving the tensor-valued vector harmonics @xmath and
associated tensor-valued vector harmonics @xmath can be derived using
the differential identities in appendix E and ( F.21 )-( F.26 ). In each
of the following identities, the pair ( @xmath , @xmath ) may be
replaced with ( @xmath , @xmath ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (F.34)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (F.35)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (F.36)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (F.37)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

### f.3 Tensor Harmonics

Tensor harmonics are defined as solutions of

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (F.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is divergence-free, trace-free and time independent:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (F.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

As with vector harmonics, every tensor harmonic @xmath defines an
associated tensor harmonic @xmath via

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (F.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

It can be shown that @xmath satisfies the definition of a tensor
harmonic ( F.38 )-( F.39 ) using ( E.24 ), ( E.29 ) and ( E.13 ). It
then follows immediately from ( F.38 ) that the quantities @xmath and
@xmath satisfy congruence orthogonality:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (F.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

Upon taking the curl of ( F.40 ) and applying ( F.38 ) and ( E.31 ), we
obtain @xmath in terms of @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (F.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

As with scalar and vector harmonics, we are restricted in our choice of
@xmath to the eigenvalues determined by Lifshitz (1946):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (F.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

We can obtain an important identity for @xmath and @xmath using ( B.6 )
and ( E.1 ), as follows (the identity for @xmath is identical, except
with @xmath replaced with @xmath ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (F.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

## Appendix G The 3-Cotton-York Tensor

In this appendix we introduce the 3-Cotton-York tensor, which is useful
in the analysis of tensor perturbations. Specifically, we are interested
in using the 3-Cotton-York tensor in place of the co-moving shear @xmath
in developing a governing DE for tensor perturbations. It is of interest
in this regard due to its relation with Bardeen’s metric potential
@xmath . We will further show that the coefficients of the shear and
Weyl tensor components can be rewritten in terms of @xmath . To the best
of the author’s knowledge, this analysis of tensor perturbations in
terms of the 3-Cotton-York tensor is new.

In terms of the trace-free spatial Ricci tensor ( 1.40 ), the
3-Cotton-York tensor is defined as (see, for example, van Elst and Uggla
(1997, p2680-1))

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (G.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

and hence is symmetric and tracefree. In the linearized context, we can
use ( B.10 ) and ( 4.28 ) to obtain an alternative first-order
expression for @xmath in terms of the Weyl tensor components, namely

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (G.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

We note that an important property of this quantity is that it has zero
spatial divergence in the linear theory. Indeed, upon taking the
divergence of ( G.2 ) and applying ( 4.31 ), ( 4.29 ), ( 4.30 ) and (
E.29 ), we obtain, to first order,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (G.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

The evolution equation for @xmath then follows upon taking the time
derivative of ( G.2 ) and applying ( 4.11 ), ( 4.24 ), ( 4.25 ) and (
E.11 ), giving

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (G.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

### g.1 Evolution Equation for the 3-Cotton-York Tensor

Instead of choosing the co-moving shear to be the basic quantity for
tensor perturbations (as in section 4.6 ), we can instead choose the
basic quantity to be the dimensionless 3-Cotton-York tensor , defined by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (G.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

Upon recalling from ( G.3 ) that the 3-Cotton-York tensor has zero
divergence, it quickly follows that @xmath also has zero divergence,
i.e.

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (G.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

Hence, @xmath can be expanded purely in terms of associated tensor
harmonics, according to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (G.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

The derivatives of @xmath along the fundamental congruence are obtained
by differentiating ( G.7 ), giving

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (G.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

Upon differentiating ( G.5 ) and using ( 3.9 ) and ( G.4 ) we obtain

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (G.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

Differentiating again and applying ( G.5 ) and ( E.17 ) yields

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (G.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

We now expand each term of this equation in terms of tensor harmonics
using ( G.7 ) and ( G.8 ), applying ( F.38 ) to remove the Laplacian
term, obtaining

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (G.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is then the second-order DE governing the evolution of the
3-Cotton-York tensor. In terms of conformal time, this DE reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (G.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is identical to Bardeen’s DE for the metric potential @xmath ,
given in Bardeen (1980) equation (4.14).

### g.2 Tensor Perturbations

We now show the relation between ( G.11 ) and the governing DE for
tensor perturbations ( 4.76 ). We note that it follows by ( G.3 ) that
the 3-Cotton-York tensor is purely tensorial, i.e. the scalar and vector
contributions to @xmath are exactly zero. Expanding @xmath in terms of
associated tensor harmonics yields

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (G.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

The coefficients @xmath can then be determined in terms of @xmath and
the tensor harmonics via ( G.2 ) upon applying ( 4.77 ), ( 4.80 ), (
4.81 ) and ( F.40 ). We obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (G.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

If we expand ( G.9 ) in terms of tensor harmonics using ( 4.77 ), ( F.38
) and ( G.8 ), we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (G.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

and hence using ( 4.81 ) that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (G.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now using ( G.16 ), we can rewrite ( 4.79 )-( 4.81 ) as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (G.17)
     @xmath   @xmath               (G.18)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (G.19)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Thus, we obtain the coefficients of the shear and Weyl tensor components
in terms of the coefficients of the 3-Cotton-York tensor @xmath .

## Appendix H Bessel and Associated Legendre Functions

In this appendix we present solutions of the Bessel DE, toroidal
Legendre DE and conical Legendre DE, which are used in solving the
governing DEs for scalar and tensor perturbations. In section H.1 we
present the normal forms of the Bessel and associated Legendre DEs and
their general solutions in terms of Bessel and associated Legendre
functions. As discussed in section H.2 , these solutions can be written
in terms of elementary functions in certain special cases. Further,
resonant solutions of the Legendre DE appear in certain cases, as
discussed in section H.3 . Finally, the asymptotic behaviour of the
general solutions is given in section H.4 .

### h.1 Normal Forms of Bessel and Associated Legendre DEs

In this section we present the normal forms of Bessel’s DE, the toroidal
Legendre DE and the conical Legendre DE along with their general
solution in terms of Bessel functions and associated Legendre functions.
Formally, the toroidal and conical Legendre functions are defined as the
composition of the associated Legendre functions with @xmath and @xmath
, respectively.

###### Bessel’s DE

  -- -------- -- -------

###### Legendre DE (Conical)

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (H.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

Solution:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (H.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

### h.2 Special Solutions of the Governing DEs

For certain values of @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , the Bessel functions
and associated Legendre @xmath functions reduce to closed-form
trigonmetric expressions. Further, in each of these cases we can derive
a second linearly independent solution @xmath of the associated Legendre
DEs ( H.3 ) and ( H.5 ) that is defined so as to reduce to @xmath in the
limit @xmath . This solution is a preferred choice, since it emphasizes
the relation between solutions for @xmath and solutions with @xmath in
the early time limit. In this section, we present the first few
instances of this behaviour and its importance in modelling
perturbations with a given fluid background.

For brevity, we shall make use of the notation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (H.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

and use the tilde @xmath to denote dependence up to a multiplicative
constant.

     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (H.25)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

### h.3 Resonant Solutions of the Legendre DE

For certain special cases, the associated Legendre functions @xmath and
@xmath are no longer linearly independent (see Abramowitz and Stegun
p333, eq. (8.1.8)). One such example is the case of scalar perturbations
with a dust background ( @xmath ), where a second solution must be
determined through alternative means. We now give the first five
examples of resonance in the Legendre DE and give the second resonant
solution of the Legendre DE for each case, denoted by @xmath . The
toroidal solutions are given below. Conical solutions are obtained by
replacing hyperbolic functions with trigonometric functions.

###### @xmath, @xmath

### h.4 Asymptotic Behaviour

We now present the asymptotic behaviour of the Bessel functions and
associated Legendre functions, both for early times and late times.

###### Bessel Functions

###### Toroidal Legendre Functions (@xmath)

the asymptotic behaviour of the toroidal Legendre functions is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (H.41)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (H.42)

as @xmath .
