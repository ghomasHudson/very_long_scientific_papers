### Acknowledgement

This doctoral thesis would not have been possible without the guidance
and support of numerous people and I wish to express my gratitude here.
Professor Peter G.L. Leach deserves a special mention. It was your
research that inspired me to wade into the symmetries of differential
equations and your encouragement when I first set about my own research
proved invaluable.
I am grateful for my collaboration with my Supervisor, Professor Michael
Tsamparlis. Your faith in my abilities and your advice, on both my
research and my career, throughout the years, has allowed me to grow to
the scientist I am today. You introduced me to the subject of
differential geometry and taught me the geometric thought process.
I would especially like to thank both my advisors Dr. Spyros Basilakos,
who opened up to me the subject of cosmology, and Dr. Christos
Efthimiopoulos; the discussions we had on the topic have been priceless.
Also, I feel fortunate and grateful for my examination committee, Prof.
S. Capozziello, Prof. P. J. Ioannou, Prof T. Apostolatos and Prof A. H.
Kara. Without your important comments I could not have completed this
thesis.
Above all, I feel grateful for my friends and family. Stelios, Sifis,
Venia and Thanos your friendship and encouragement all these years have
been my most valuable support mechanism.
Last but not least, I would not be who I am today without my family. My
parents Maria and Sotiris, and my grandfather Ioannis, you have always
believed in and you have supported me in all the important decisions of
my life. Marianthi, your patience, your kindness and your help on all
levels, is more than any brother deserves.

## Part I Introduction

### Chapter 1 Introduction

#### 1.1 Summary

In this thesis, we study the geometric properties of the Lie and the
Noether point symmetries of second order differential equations. In
particular, we find a connection between the point symmetries of some
class of second order differential equations with the collineations of
the underlying manifold where the ”motion” occurs.

The novelty here is that we provide a geometrical method to determine
the symmetries of dynamical systems. The importance of Lie and Noether
symmetries is that they offer invariant functions which can be used to
find analytic solutions of the dynamical system.

The above mentioned geometric method is applied in order the two and
three dimensional Newtonian dynamical systems to be classified in
relation to the point symmetries; to generalize the Newtonian
Kepler-Ermakov system in Riemannian spaces; to study the symmetries
between classical and quantum systems and to investigate the geometric
origin of the Type II hidden symmetries for the homogeneous heat
equation and for the Laplace equation in Riemannian spaces. At last but
not least, we apply this geometric approach in order to determine the
dark energy models by use the Noether symmetries as a geometric
criterion in modified theories of gravity.

The plan of the thesis is as follows.

##### 1.1.1 Summary of Part I: Introduction

In Part I we give the basic properties and definitions of one parameter
point transformations.

In Chapter 2 , we study the geometry of the one parameter point
transformation, the properties of Lie algebras and the invariant
functions. Moreover, the Lie and the Noether symmetries of ordinary and
partial differential equations are analyzed and two schemes for using
Lie symmetries to construct solutions are presented. Furthermore, we
study the action of point transformation on linear differential geometry
object.

##### 1.1.2 Summary of Part II: Symmetries of ODEs

In Part II we study the geometric origin of the Lie and the Noether
point symmetries of second order ordinary differential equations.

In Chapter 3 , we consider the set of autoparallels - not necessarily
affinely parameterized - of a symmetric connection. We find that the
major symmetry condition relates the Lie symmetries with the special
projective symmetries of the connection. We derive the Lie symmetry
conditions for a general system of second order ODE polynomial in the
first derivatives and we apply these conditions in the special case of
geodesic equations of Riemannian spaces. Furthermore we give the generic
Lie symmetry vector of the geodesic equations in terms of the special
projective collineations of the metric and their degenerates and the
generic Noether symmetry vector of the geodesic Lagrangian in terms of
the homothetic algebra of the Riemannian space. Finally we apply the
results to various cases and eventually we give the Lie symmetries, the
Noether symmetries and the associated conserved quantities of Einstein
spaces, the Gödel spacetime, the Taub spacetime and the Friedman
Robertson Walker spacetimes.

In Chapter 4 , we generalize the results of the previous chapter in the
case of the equations of motion of a particle moving in a Riemannian
space under the action of a general force @xmath . We apply these
results in order to determine all two dimensional and and all three
dimensional Newtonian dynamical systems which admit Lie and Noether
point symmetries. We demonstrate the use of the results in two cases.
The non-conservative Kepler - Ermakov system and the case of the Hènon
Heiles type potentials.

In Chapter 5 , we generalize the two-dimensional autonomous
Hamiltonian–Kepler–Ermakov dynamical system to three dimensions using
the @xmath invariance of Noether symmetries and determine all
three-dimensional autonomous Hamiltonian–Kepler–Ermakov dynamical
systems which are Liouville integrable via Noether symmetries.
Subsequently, we generalize the autonomous Kepler–Ermakov system in a
Riemannian space which admits a gradient homothetic vector by the
requirements (a) that it admits a first integral (the Riemannian Ermakov
invariant) and (b) it has @xmath invariance. We consider both the
non-Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian systems. In each case, we compute
the Riemannian–Ermakov invariant and the equations defining the
dynamical system. We apply the results in general relativity and
determine the autonomous Hamiltonian-Riemannian–Kepler–Ermakov system in
the spatially flat Friedman Robertson Walker spacetime. We consider a
locally rotational symmetric spacetime of class A and discuss two
cosmological models. The first cosmological model consists of a scalar
field with an exponential potential and a perfect fluid with a stiff
equation of state. The second cosmological model is the @xmath -modified
gravity model of @xmath CDM. It is shown that in both applications the
gravitational field equations reduce to those of the generalized
autonomous Riemannian–Kepler–Ermakov dynamical system which is Liouville
integrable via Noether integrals.

##### 1.1.3 Summary of Part III: Symmetries of PDEs

In Part III we study the geometric origin of the Lie and the Noether
point symmetries of second order ordinary differential equations.

In Chapter 6 , we attempt to extend this correspondence of point
symmetries and collineations of the space to the case of second order
partial differential equations. We examine the PDE of the form @xmath
,where @xmath and @xmath stands for the second partial derivative. We
find that if the coefficients @xmath are independent of @xmath then the
Lie point symmetries of the PDE form a subgroup of the conformal
symmetries of the metric defined by the coefficients @xmath . We
specialize the study to linear forms of @xmath and write the Lie
symmetry conditions for this case. We apply this result to two cases.
The Poisson/Yamabe equation for which we derive the Lie symmetry
vectors. Subsequently we consider the heat equation with a flux in an
n-dimensional Riemannian space and show that the Lie symmetry algebra is
a subalgebra of the homothetic algebra of the space. We discuss this
result in the case of de Sitter space time and in flat space.

In Chapter 7 , we determine the Lie point symmetries of the Schrödinger
and the Klein Gordon equations in a general Riemannian space. It is
shown that these symmetries are related with the homothetic and the
conformal algebra of the metric of the space respectively. We consider
the kinematic metric defined by the classical Lagrangian and show how
the Lie point symmetries of the Schrödinger equation and the Klein
Gordon equation are related with the Noether point symmetries of this
Lagrangian. The general results are applied to two practical problems a.
The classification of all two and three dimensional potentials in a
Euclidian space for which the Schrödinger equation and the Klein Gordon
equation admit Lie point symmetries and b. The application of Lie point
symmetries of the Klein Gordon equation in the exterior Schwarzschild
spacetime and the determination of the metric by means of conformally
related Lagrangians.

In Chapter 8 , we study the geometric origin of Type II hidden
symmetries for the Laplace equation and for the homogeneous heat
equation in certain Riemannian spaces. As concerns the homogeneous heat
equation, we study the reduction of the heat equation in Riemannian
spaces which admit a gradient Killing vector, a gradient homothetic
vector and in Petrov Type D, N, II and Type III spacetimes. In each
reduction we identify the source of the Type II hidden symmetries. More
specifically we find that (a) if we reduce the heat equation by the
symmetries generated by the gradient KV the reduced equation is a linear
heat equation in the nondecomposable space. (b) If we reduce the heat
equation via the symmetries generated by the gradient HV the reduced
equation is a Laplace equation for an appropriate metric. In this case
the Type II hidden symmetries are generated from the proper CKVs. (c) In
the Petrov space–times the reduction of the heat equation by the
symmetry generated from the nongradient HV gives PDEs which inherit the
Lie symmetries hence no Type II hidden symmetries appear.  For the
reduction of the Laplace equation we consider Riemannian spaces which
admit a gradient Killing vector, a gradient Homothetic vector and a
special Conformal Killing vector. In each reduction we identify the
source of Type II hidden symmetries. We find that in general the Type II
hidden symmetries of the Laplace equation are directly related to the
transition of the CKVs from the space where the original equation is
defined to the space where the reduced equation resides. In particular
we consider the reduction of the Laplace equation (i.e., the wave
equation) in the Minkowski space and obtain the results of all previous
studies in a straightforward manner. We consider the reduction of
Laplace equation in spaces which admit Lie point symmetries generated
from a non-gradient HV and a proper CKV and we show that the reduction
with these vectors does not produce Type II hidden symmetries. We apply
the results to general relativity and consider the reduction of Laplace
equation in locally rotational symmetric space times (LRS) and in
algebraically special vacuum solutions of Einstein’s equations which
admit a homothetic algebra acting simply transitively. In each case we
determine the Type II hidden symmetries. We apply the general results to
cases in which the initial metric is specified.

##### 1.1.4 Summary of Part IV: Noether symmetries and theories of
gravity

In Part IV, we apply the Noether symmetry approach as a geometric
criterion, in order to probe the nature of dark energy in modified
theories of gravity.

In Chapter 9 , we discuss the conformal equivalence of Lagrangians for
scalar fields in a Riemannian space of dimension @xmath and @xmath
respectively. In particular we enunciate a theorem which proves that the
field equations for a non-minimally coupled scalar field are the same at
the conformal level with the field equations of the minimally coupled
scalar field. The necessity to preserve Einstein’s equations in the
context of Friedmann Robertson Walker spacetime leads us to apply, the
current general analysis to the scalar field (quintessence or phantom)
in spatially flat FRW cosmologies. Furthermore, we apply the Noether
symmetry approach in non minimally coupled scalar field in a spatially
flat FRW spacetime and by using the Noether invariants we determine
analytical solutions for the field equations. Moreover we apply the same
procedure for a minimally coupled scalar field in a spatially flat FRW
spacetime and in Biachi Class A homogeneous spacetimes.

In Chapter 10 , a detailed study of the modified gravity, @xmath models
is performed, using that the Noether point symmetries of these models
are geometric symmetries of the mini superspace of the theory. It is
shown that the requirement that the field equations admit Noether point
symmetries selects definite models in a self-consistent way. As an
application in Cosmology we consider the Friedman -Robertson-Walker
spacetime and show that the only cosmological model which is integrable
via Noether point symmetries is the @xmath CDM model, which generalizes
the Lambda Cosmology. Furthermore using the corresponding Noether
integrals we compute the analytic form of the main cosmological
functions.

In Chapter 11 , we apply the Noether symmetry approach in the @xmath
modified theory of gravity in a spatially flat FRW spacetime and in
static spherically symmetric spacetime.  First, we present a full set of
Noether symmetries for some minisuperspace models and we find that only
the @xmath model admits extra Noether symmetries. The existence of extra
Noether integrals can be used in order to simplify the system of
differential equations as well as to determine the integrability of the
model. Then, we compute analytical solutions and find that spherically
symmetric solutions in @xmath gravity can be recast in terms of
Schwarzschild-like solutions modified by a distortion function depending
on a characteristic radius.

Finally, in Chapter 12 we discuss our results.

### Chapter 2 Point transformations and Invariant functions

#### 2.1 Introduction

Lie symmetry of a differential equation is a one parameter point
transformation which leaves the differential equation invariant. Lie
symmetries ¹ ¹ 1 In the following sections, by Lie symmetry we mean
point symmetry. There are also generalized Lie symmetries which are not
point symmetries. is the main tool to study nonlinear differential
equations. Indeed Lie symmetries provide invariant functions which can
be used to construct analytic solutions for a differential equation.
These solutions we call invariant solutions. One such example is the
solution @xmath of the wave equation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which is found by applying the Lie symmetry @xmath

The structure of the chapter is as follows. In section 2.2 , we study
the geometry of the one parameter point transformation, the properties
of Lie algebras and the invariant functions. Invariant functions are
functions which remain unchanged under the action of a point
transformation. In section 2.3 , the Lie symmetries of ordinary and
partial differential equations are analyzed and two schemes for using
Lie symmetries to construct solutions are presented. In section 2.6 ,
Noether symmetries, a special class of Lie symmetries, are discussed.
Noether symmetries are admited only by systems whose equation of motion
result from a variational principle. Noether symmetries are important
because they produce conservation laws and can be used to simplify the
differential equations.

In section 2.7 , the action of point transformation on linear
differential geometry object is examined. Collineations are point
transformations which do not leave necessary invariant a geometric
object. In particular we study the collineations of the metric
(Conformal motions) and of the Christoffel symbols (Projective
collineations) of a Riemannian space.

#### 2.2 Point Transformations

Let @xmath be a manifold of class @xmath with @xmath and let @xmath be a
neighborhood in @xmath Consider two points @xmath with coordinates
@xmath and @xmath respectively. A point transformation on @xmath is a
relation among the coordinates of the points @xmath which is defined by
the transformation equations

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the functions @xmath are @xmath and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

Condition ( 2.1 ) means that the functions @xmath are independent. A
special class of point transformations are the one parameter point
transformations defined as follows [ 1 ] .

###### Definition 2.2.1

The one parameter point transformations are point transformations that
depend on one arbitrary parameter as follows

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and the transformation satisfies the following conditions.

a) They are well defined, that is, that if

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

then @xmath and @xmath

b) They can be composed, that is, that if

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

are two successive one parameter point transformations, there is a one
parameter point transformation parametrized by the real parameter @xmath
so that @xmath

c) They are invertible, that is, for each one parameter point
transformation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

there exists the inverse transformation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

d)There is the identity transformation defined by the value ² ² 2
Without abandoning generality, we can take @xmath . @xmath that is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

From the above it follows that the one parameter point transformations
form a group. A group of one parameter point transformation defines a
family of curves in @xmath which are parametrized by the parameter
@xmath and are called the orbits of the group of transformations . These
curves may be viewed as the integral curves of a differentiable vector
field @xmath

##### 2.2.1 Infinitesimal Transformations

Let @xmath be the parametric equations of a group orbit through the
point @xmath . The tangent vector at the point @xmath is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The vector @xmath defines near the point @xmath a point transformation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we have set

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

The point transformation ( 2.3 ) is a one parameter a point
transformation which is called an infinitesimal point transformation .
The vector field @xmath is called the generator of the infinitesimal
transformation ( 2.3 ) along the orbit through the point @xmath .
Evidently, the infinitesimal transformation moves a point along the
orbit of the group through that point.

###### Example 2.2.2

Compute the generator of the infinitesimal transformation for the one
parameter point transformation

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Solution: We have

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

from which follows that the generator of the infinitesimal
transformation is @xmath

It has been showed that a one parameter point transformation fixes an
infinitesimal generator up to a constant depending on the
parametrization of the group orbit. In the following section, it will be
shown that the converse holds true, that is, for an infinitesimal
generator there always exists a unique one parameter point
transformation.

###### Integral curves

Consider a differentiable vector field @xmath given by @xmath . At each
point of @xmath , @xmath determines a smooth curve @xmath , where @xmath
and @xmath is an open intevral of @xmath as follows

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

The curve @xmath is called the integral curve of @xmath through @xmath .

Equation ( 2.5 ) defines an autonomous system of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) with solutions @xmath subject to the initial conditions
@xmath . The existence and uniqueness of integral curves is given by,
the following theorem [ 2 ] .

###### Theorem 2.2.3

Let @xmath and @xmath be two integral curves of the vector field @xmath
on @xmath with the same initial condition @xmath . Then @xmath and
@xmath are equal on @xmath , where @xmath are two open intervals of
@xmath

In the case where @xmath defines a one parameter point transformation,
the system ( 2.5 ) defines the generator of the infinitesimal
transformation. Due to the uniqueness of the solution there exists only
one parameter point transformation for each vector field @xmath .

###### Example 2.2.4

Consider the space @xmath with coordinates @xmath and the vector field
@xmath . Find the integral curve of @xmath through the point @xmath

Solution: Let @xmath be the integral curve of @xmath passing through
@xmath . The system of autonomous first order equations defining the
integral curves are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with the initial condition @xmath . The solution of this system is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.6)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Equations ( 2.6 ),( 2.7 ) define the rotation in the hyperbolic space.

##### 2.2.2 Invariant Functions

Let @xmath be a function in @xmath . Under the one parameter point
transformation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

the function becomes @xmath

###### Definition 2.2.5

The function @xmath is invariant under the one parameter point
transformation if and only if @xmath when @xmath at all points where the
one parameter point transformation acts. Equivalently, the generator
@xmath of the point transformation @xmath is a symmetry of the function
@xmath if

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

The symmetry condition ( 2.8 ) is equivalent to the first order partial
differential equation (PDE)

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

In order to determine all functions which are invariant under the
infinitesimal generator @xmath one has to solve the associated Lagrange
system

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The characteristic function or zero order invariant @xmath of @xmath is
defined as follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

The zero order invariant is indeed invariant under the @xmath that is
@xmath Therefore, any function of the form @xmath where @xmath is the
zero order invariant satisfies ( 2.9 ) and it is invariant under the one
parameter point transformation with generator @xmath

##### 2.2.3 Lie Algebras

In section 2.2 we considered the one parameter point transformation
which depend on one parameter @xmath . However transformations can
depend on more that one parameter, as follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a vector field in the @xmath with the same properties of
definition 2.2.1 , is a multi parameter point transformation,

For every parameter @xmath of the multi parameter point transformation (
2.11 ) an infinitesimal generator can be defined

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Let @xmath be a function in @xmath which is invariant under a
multiparameter point transformation. Since the multi parameter
transformation can be described as @xmath one parameter point
transformations, @xmath is invariant under @xmath infinitesimal
generators.

###### Definition 2.2.6

A Lie algebra is a finite dimensional linear space @xmath in which a
binary operator, denoted @xmath has been defined which has the following
properties

i) @xmath for all @xmath

ii) @xmath for all @xmath .

iii)If @xmath then @xmath , @xmath . The quantities @xmath are constants
and are called the structure constants of the Lie algebra.

The operator @xmath is called the commutator and it is defined by the
following expression

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

From the definition of the commutator ( 2.12 ) and from the requirements
of the Lie algebra, it follows that the structure constants are
antisymmetric in the two lower indices, i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

and they have to satisfy the Jacobi identity

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

The structure constants characterize the Lie algebra because every set
of constants @xmath which satisfy ( 2.13 ) and ( 2.14 ) defines locally
a unique Lie group. An important property of the structure constants is
that they do not change under a coordinate transformation. The structure
constants do change under a transformation of the basis; this property
is useful because it can be used to simplify the structure constants of
the given group.

###### Definition 2.2.7

Let @xmath be closed Lie algebras with elements @xmath respectively. If
@xmath and @xmath then @xmath is called a Lie subalgebra of @xmath

Suppose  that the vector fields @xmath leave invariant a function @xmath
. If @xmath with @xmath , i.e. the generators @xmath do not form a
closed Lie algebra, then @xmath is also invariant under the action of
@xmath . This process can be used to find extra symmetries.

###### Example 2.2.8

The vector fields

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

span the @xmath Lie algebra with structure constants @xmath i.e. the
commutators are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If the function @xmath is invariant under the infinitesimal generators
@xmath , then it is also invariant under the action of @xmath . In that
case, it is easy to see that @xmath where @xmath is a constant.

#### 2.3 Lie symmetries of differential equations

Previously, we studied the case when a function @xmath is invariant
under the action of a one parameter point transformation. In the
following we consider the case of differential equations (DEs) which are
invariant under a group of one parameter point transformations.

##### 2.3.1 Prolongation of point transformations

In order to study the action of a point transformation to a differential
equation @xmath where @xmath , we have to prolong the point
transformation to the derivatives @xmath . The infinitesimal
transformation ( 2.3 ) in the jet space @xmath is

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where @xmath and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

That means that the variation equals the difference of the derivatives
before and after the action of the one parameter transformation. For the
first prolongation function @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Similarly for @xmath we have the expression

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

Finally, the extension of the infinitesimal generator in the jet space
@xmath is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The field @xmath is called the nth prolongation of the generator @xmath
where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is the infinitesimal point generator in the space @xmath .

It is possible to write the prolongation coefficients in terms of the
partial derivatives of the components @xmath . The first and the second
prolongation are expressed as follows

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the comma @xmath denotes partial derivative.

Some important observations [ 3 ] for the prolongation coefficient
@xmath are:

(a) @xmath is linear in @xmath

(b) @xmath is a polynomial in the derivatives @xmath whose coefficients
are linear homogeneous in the functions @xmath @xmath up to nth order
partial derivatives.

###### Multiparameter prolongation

In the case the differential equation @xmath depends on @xmath
independent @xmath variables @xmath and @xmath dependent variables
@xmath , i.e. @xmath we consider the one parameter point transformation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In this case the generating vector is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

To extend the generator vector in the jet space @xmath we apply the same
procedure as in section 2.3.1 . Therefore the vector field @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is defined as the nth prolongation of the generator ( 2.17 ), where ³ ³
3 Where @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

In terms of the partial derivatives of the components @xmath of the
generator vector ( 2.17 ), the first and the second prologations of (
2.17 ) are expressed as follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

##### 2.3.2 Lie symmetries of ODEs

In the previous sections we analyzed the invariance of functions under
the action of a point transformation. In the following we define the
invariance of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under a one
parameter point transformation.

Consider the @xmath dimensional system of ODEs ⁴ ⁴ 4 In the following
equations, @xmath is the independent parameter and @xmath the dependent
parameters.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath , @xmath and the infinitesimal point transformation with
infinitesimal generator @xmath is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.23)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.24)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

###### Theorem 2.3.1

Let

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

be the infinitesimal generator of point transformation ( 2.23 )-( 2.24 )
and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

be the nth prolongation of @xmath , where @xmath is given by ( 2.19 ).
We shall say that the @xmath dimensional system of ODEs ( 2.22 ) is
invariant under the point transformation ( 2.23 ), ( 2.24 ) if and only
if there exists a function @xmath such as the following condition holds

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

where ⁵ ⁵ 5 For Hamiltonian systems, the operator @xmath is called
Hamiltonian vector field .

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In that case we say that @xmath is a Lie point symmetry of the @xmath
dimensional system of ODEs ( 2.22 ).

If @xmath is a solution of the system ( 2.22 ), i.e. @xmath then
condition ( 2.26 ) becomes @xmath that is,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

Equations ( 2.27 ) are called the determining equations. The solution of
the determining equations ( 2.27 ) gives the infinitesimal generators of
the transformation ( 2.23 )-( 2.24 ).

In general, a function @xmath is invariant under the transformation (
2.23 )-( 2.24 ) if and only if

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a function to be determined [ 4 ] .

Below we give an example in which the Lie symmetries are calculated
using the symmetry condition ( 2.27 ).

###### Example 2.3.2

Find the Lie symmetries of the ODE @xmath

Solution: Condition ( 2.27 ) gives @xmath From ( 2.16 ) the following
condition is found

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

since @xmath . Functions @xmath are dependent only on the variables
@xmath , hence equation ( 2.29 ) is a polynomial of @xmath This
polynomial must vanish identically hence the coefficients of all powers
of @xmath must vanish. Therefore, we have the following determining
equations

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

whosw solution is

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

We conclude that the second order ODE @xmath has eight Lie pont
symmetries generated by the generic vector field ⁶ ⁶ 6 As many as the
unspecified constants in the expression of the generic symmetric vector.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

These vectors are the generators of the projective algebra @xmath of the
2-d Euclidian plane. Furthermore, this is the maximum number of
symmetries that a single second order ODE (in one variable!) can have.

Lie symmetries can be used to find invariants or to reduce the order of
an ODE. Furthermore an ODE is characterized by the admitted algabra of
Lie symmetries. For second order ODEs we have the following theorem.

###### Theorem 2.3.3

If a second order ODE @xmath admits as Lie point symmetries the eight
 of @xmath , then, there exists a transformation which brings the
equation to the form @xmath and vice versa.

For instance the equations

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

are equivalent to the equation of motion of a free particle [ 5 , 6 , 7
] , because they are invariant under the action of the Lie algebra
@xmath The transformation where the admitted @xmath algebra is written
in the form ( 2.30 ) is a coordinate transformation on @xmath @xmath
which transforms the ODE to the form @xmath This procedure is called
linearization process (see [ 8 , 9 ] and references therein).

Below we present two methods where the use of Lie symmetries reduces the
order of an ODE.

###### Canonical coordinates

###### Definition 2.3.4

Let @xmath be a vector field with coordinates @xmath . If under the
coordinate transformation @xmath holds that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

then, we say that @xmath are the canonical coordinates of @xmath i.e.
@xmath .

Canonical coordinates can be used to reduce by one the order of an ODE.
 Consider the @xmath order ODE @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

Let @xmath be a Lie symmetry of ( 2.32 ) written in canonical
coordinates. The nth prolongation of the symmetry vector is @xmath so
condition ( 2.27 ) sets the constraint

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This implies that the function @xmath is independent of @xmath
consequently ( 2.32 ) can be written in the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is a @xmath order ODE, where @xmath is defined by @xmath .

###### Example 2.3.5

Use the canonical coordinates of the Lie symmetry @xmath to reduce the
order of the ODE

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

Solution: The canonical coordinates of @xmath are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For the first and the second derivative of @xmath we compute

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath .

Replacing in 2.34 , we find the reduced equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have set @xmath . Equation ( 2.35 ) is an Abel equation of the
first kind [ 10 ] invariant under @xmath

###### Invariants

As in the case of functions in @xmath (see section 2.2.2 ), condition (
2.28 ) is equivalent to the following Lagrange system

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Lagrange system ( 2.36 ) provides us with characteristic functions

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is called the nth order invariant of the Lie symmetry
vector. If ( 2.25 ) is a Lie symmetry for the ODE

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

it follows that ( 2.37 ) can be written as a function of the
characteristic functions @xmath of ( 2.25 ).

Let @xmath where @xmath are the zero and the first order invariants of a
Lie symmetry repetitively. From the invariants @xmath define the
differential invariants

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The differential invariants are functions of @xmath , hence, it is
feasible that ( 2.37 ) may be written in terms of the differential
invariants ( 2.38 ), i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is a @xmath order ODE.

###### Example 2.3.6

Use the first order invariants of the Lie symmetry @xmath to reduce the
order of the Lane-Emden equation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath . The Lane-Emden equation arises in the study of
equilibrium configurations of a spherical gas cloud acting under the
mutual attractions of its molecules and subject to the laws of
thermodynamics [ 11 , 12 ] .

Solution: The first prolongation of @xmath is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

hence, the corresponding Lagrange system is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The zero and the first order invariants are found to be

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The differential invariant is defined as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Substituting in the Lane-Emden equation we obtain the first order ODE

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . Equation ( 2.40 ) is an Abel equation of the second kind
[ 10 ] .

An interesting application of the Lie invariants to the classical Kepler
system can be found in [ 13 ] where the authors derive the Runge-Lenz
vector using the first order invariants of a point transformation.

It is possible an ODE to admit many symmetries which span a Lie algebra
@xmath of dimension @xmath . The following theorem relates the Lie point
symmetries of the reduced and of the original equation.

###### Theorem 2.3.7

Consider an ODE which admits the Lie point symmetries @xmath which are
such that @xmath Then, the reduction by @xmath leads to a reduced
equation which admits @xmath as a Lie symmetry whereas reduction of the
ODE by @xmath leads to a reduced equation, which does not admit @xmath
as a Lie symmetry.

In case the generators @xmath form an Abelian Lie algebra, i.e. @xmath
then, the reduction preserves the Lie symmetries. Theorem 2.3.7 is
important because it gives a hint as to which generator the reduction of
an ODE must start in order to continue the reduction process with the
reduced equation.

Since the reduced equation is different from the original equation, it
is possible the reduced equation to admit extra Lie symmetries, which
are not Lie symmetries of the original equation. These new Lie
symmetries have been named Type II hidden symmetries . Type II hidden
symmetries can be used to continue the reduction process and - if it is
feasible - to find a solution of the original equation [ 14 ] .

There are other methods to apply Lie symmetries; a quite intriguing
application of Lie symmetries is to produce integrals or Lagrangian
functions for a system of ODEs by the  method of Jacobi’s last
multiplier (see [ 15 , 16 , 17 ] and references therein).

#### 2.4 Lie symmetries of PDEs

A partial differential equation (PDE) is a function @xmath in the jet
space @xmath where @xmath are the independent variables and @xmath are
the dependent variables. As in the case of ODEs we define the invariance
of a PDE under the infinitesimal point transformation

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.41)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.42)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

with generator @xmath as follows.

###### Definition 2.4.1

Let

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

be the generator of the infinitesimal point transformation ( 2.41 )-(
2.42 ) and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

be the nth prolongation vector, where @xmath is given from ( 2.19 ).
Then, the transformation ( 2.41 )-( 2.42 ) leaves invariant the PDE

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

if there exist a function @xmath where the following condition holds,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

The infinitesimal generator @xmath is called a Lie point symmetry of the
PDE ( 2.44 ).

In case the PDE ( 2.44 ) can we written in solved form, i.e.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

then the Lie condition ( 2.45 ) is equivalent to the following system of
equations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

Consequently the family of all solutions of ( 2.44 ) is invariant under
( 2.41 )-( 2.42 ) if condition ( 2.45 ) holds. In the example below we
compute the Lie symmetries of the homogeneous heat equation.

###### Example 2.4.2

Find the Lie symmetries of the 1+1 heat equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

Solution: Let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

be a Lie symmetry of ( 2.47 ). Then condition ( 2.46 ) gives

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Substituting @xmath from ( 2.20 ),( 2.21 ) and collecting terms of
derivatives of @xmath we find the following determining equations

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The solution of the system of equations is

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where @xmath is a solution of the heat equation. The generic vector of
the infinitesimal transformation which leaves invariant the heat
equation is

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

###### Invariant solutions

In section 2.3.2 , it has been explained how to use the canonical
coordinates to reduce the order of an ODE. The infinitesimal generator
@xmath is a Lie symmetry of the heat equation ( 2.47 ), written in
canonical coordinates. Nevertheless ( 2.47 ) cannot be reduced as it
happened with the case of ODEs. However, one can calculate from the Lie
symmetry @xmath the zero order invariants, which are @xmath . We select
@xmath to be the independent variable and @xmath Substituting the
invariants in ( 2.47 ) we get the ODE @xmath Then, the following
solution can be found easily

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is independent on the variable @xmath That is, the use of the Lie
symmetry @xmath reduces by one the number of independent variables but
not the order of the PDE. The solution ( 2.48 ) is called an invariant
solution .

###### Definition 2.4.3

The function @xmath is an invariant solution corresponding to the
infinitesimal generator ( 2.43 ), if and only if @xmath is an invariant
of the infinitesimal generator, i.e. @xmath @xmath and solves the PDE (
2.44 ).

By definition, a Lie symmetry maps a solution onto a solution. The
action of the point transformation with infinitesimal generator @xmath
on a solution @xmath of ( 2.47 ) is @xmath , that is, @xmath or @xmath ,
hence the use of Lie point symmetries gives a constraint equation.
However, if a solution of a PDE is already known we can apply the point
transformation to obtain a family of solutions. This new solutions will
depend on at most as many new parameters as there are in the symmetry
transformation used.

###### Theorem 2.4.4

Assume that the PDE ( 2.44 ) admits a Lie point symmetry and let @xmath
be a solution of ( 2.44 ) which is not invariant under this Lie
symmetry. Then, under the transformation ( 2.41 )-( 2.42 ) the solution
@xmath defines a family of solutions of the PDE.

For instance, the point transformation corresponding to the Lie symmetry

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

of the heat equation ( 2.47 ) is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then, if @xmath is a solution of ( 2.47 ), which is not an invariant
solution, the function

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is also a solution of ( 2.47 ).

#### 2.5 Lie Bäcklund symmetries

So far we have considered point transformations which depend on the
variables of the base manifold only. However there exist point
transformations who are defined in the jet space and depend also on the
derivatives.

The infinitesimal transformation

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.49)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.50)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

is called Lie Bäcklund transformation . This point transformation does
not concern the present work but for the completeness we we give the
basic definitions.

###### Definition 2.5.1

The generator @xmath generates a Lie Bäcklund symmetry for the DE @xmath
if and only if there exist a function @xmath such as the following
condition holds.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It follows from the above definition that a Lie Bäcklund symmetry
preserves the set of solutions @xmath of the DE, i.e. @xmath where
@xmath is a constant. A special class of Lie Bäcklund symmetries are the
contact symmetries. Contact symmetry is a Lie Bäcklund symmetry where
the generator depends only on the first derivative of @xmath , i.e. the
generator of transformation ( 2.49 )-( 2.49 ) has the form @xmath .

###### Proposition 2.5.2

The generator @xmath is the canonical form of the operator @xmath

The operator @xmath is always a Lie Bäcklund symmetry (the trivial one
@xmath since @xmath in the canonical form is @xmath ), hence @xmath is
also a Lie Bäcklund symmetry. If @xmath is a Lie Bäcklund symmetry, then
the generator @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is also a Lie Bäcklund symmetry. Since @xmath is an arbitrary function
we set @xmath and obtain

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We can always absorb the term @xmath inside the @xmath and have the
final result that @xmath is the generator of a Lie Bäcklund symmetry.

For a PDE the generator of a Lie point symmetry is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

then in this case the vector @xmath can be written as

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

which is linear in the first derivative; that is, for PDEs, Lie
symmetries are equivalent to contact symmetries that are linear in the
first derivative @xmath ( that property does not hold for ODEs ). For
example, the Lie point symmetry @xmath of a PDE is equivalent to the Lie
Bäcklund symmetry @xmath .

#### 2.6 Noether point symmetries

In the following sections we consider the Lie symmetries and the
conservation laws of systems admitting a Lagrangian function, i.e.
systems whose equations of motion follow from a variational principle
(e.g. Hamilton principle).

##### 2.6.1 Noether symmetries of ODEs

In Analytical Mechanics the Lagrangian @xmath is a function describing
the dynamics of a system. The equations of motion of the dynamical
system follow from the action of the Euler Lagrange vector @xmath on the
Lagragian @xmath , i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the Euler Lagrange vector

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

If the Lagrangian is invariant under the action of the transformation (
2.23 )-( 2.24 ), then, it is easy to observe that the Euler Lagrange
equations ( 2.51 ) are invariant under the transformation ( 2.23 )-(
2.24 ). E. Noether proved that if the action of a one parameter point
transformation leaves invariant the Euler Lagrange equations ( 2.51 )
then there exists a conserved quantity corresponding to the point
transformation.

###### Theorem 2.6.1

Let

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

be the infinitesimal generator of transformation ( 2.23 )-( 2.24 ) and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

be a Lagrangian describing the dynamical system ( 2.51 ). The action of
the transformation ( 2.23 )-( 2.24 ) on ( 2.54 ) ⁷ ⁷ 7 For the
application of Noether theorem in higher order Lagrangians see [ 18 ]
leaves the Euler Lagrange equations ( 2.51 ) invariant, if and only if
there exist a function @xmath such that the following condition holds

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the first prolongation of ( 2.53 ).

If the generator ( 2.53 ) satisfies ( 2.55 ), the generator ( 2.53 ) is
a Noether symmetry of the dynamical system described by the Lagrangian (
2.54 ). Noether symmetries form a Lie algebra called the Noether algebra
. If the dynamical system ( 2.51 ) admits Lie symmetries which span
a Lie algebra @xmath of dimension @xmath then the Noether symmetries of
( 2.51 ) form a Lie algebra @xmath which is a subalgebra of @xmath
@xmath .

###### Theorem 2.6.2

For any Noether point symmetry ( 2.53 ) of the Lagrangian ( 2.54 ) there
corresponds a function @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is a first integral i.e. @xmath of the equations of motion. The
function ( 2.56 ) is called a Noether integral (first integral) of (
2.51 ).

Since a Noether symmetry leaves the DEs ( 2.51 ) invariant, it is also a
Lie symmetry of ( 2.51 ) and from ( 2.26 ) we can say that ( 2.56 )
satisfies the condition @xmath , that is, Noether integrals are
invariant functions of the Noether symmetry vector @xmath

The existence and the number of Noether symmetries characterize a
dynamical system. If a dynamical system ( 2.51 ) on @xmath degrees of
freedom admits (at least) @xmath linear independent first integrals ⁸ ⁸
8 Not necessarilly Noether point integrals. @xmath which are in
involution, i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the Poisson bracket, then the solution of the dynamical
system can be obtained by quadratures.

We calculate the Noether symmetries of the free particle and of the
harmonic oscillator.

###### Example 2.6.3

Find the Noether symmetries of the Lagrangian @xmath

Solution: The Lagrangian corresponds to the equation of motion of the
free particle @xmath . In example 2.3.2 , the Lie symmetries of the free
particle were calculated. The generic Lie symmetry vector is applied to
condition ( 2.55 ) and it is found that the generic Noether symmetry of
the free particle is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

From the generic vector ( 2.58 ) and ( 2.56 ), it is found that the
corresponding Noether integral is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Example 2.6.4

Find the Noether symmetries of the one dimensional harmonic oscillator
with Lagrangian

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

Solution: To derive the Noether symmetries of ( 2.59 ) we apply theorem
2.6.1 . Let @xmath be the infinitesimal generator. The first
prolongation @xmath is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath For the terms of ( 2.55 ) we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Replacing in ( 2.55 ) we find:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The determining equations are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

The solution of the system of equations ( 2.60 )-( 2.61 ) gives the
generic Noether symmetry [ 19 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.62)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

with the corresponding gauge function

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It should be underlined that the free particle and the harmonic
oscillator have the same number of Noether symmetries. It can be easily
noticed that the Lie algebras ( 2.58 ) and ( 2.62 ) are the same Lie
algebra in different representations.

##### 2.6.2 Noether point symmetries of PDEs

In case of PDEs

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.63)
  -- -------- -- --------

which arise from a variational principle the following theorem holds.

###### Theorem 2.6.5

The action of the transformation ( 2.41 )-( 2.42 ) on the Lagrangian

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

leaves ( 2.63 ) invariant if there exists a vector field @xmath such
that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The generator of the point transformation ( 2.41 )-( 2.42 ) is called
Noether symmetry . The corresponding Noether flow is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.65)
  -- -------- -- --------

and satisfies the condition @xmath

The implementation of Noether flows in PDEs differs from that in the
ODEs. Conservation flow ( 2.65 ) is used to reduce the order of ( 2.63 )
by defining a new dependent variable @xmath .  It has been proved that
the solution of the system

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

is also a solution of ( 2.63 ). Furthermore, it is feasible new
symmetries to arise from the system ( 2.66 ) which are not symmetries of
( 2.63 ). These new symmetries have been called potential symmetries [
20 ] .

#### 2.7 Collineations of Riemannian manifolds

Previously, we studied the case when a function is invariant under a
point transformation. In the following subsections we consider the cases
in which a function is invariant under a point transformation. In order
to do this we shall need the concept of the Lie derivative. In
particular, the geometric objects which will be considered the metric
tensor @xmath and the connection coefficients @xmath in a Riemannian
space.

###### Definition 2.7.1

Consider an n dimensional space @xmath of class @xmath . An object is
called a geometric object of class @xmath if it has the following
properties @xmath

i) In each coordinate system @xmath it has a well determined set of
components @xmath .

ii) Under a coordinate transformation @xmath the new components @xmath
of the object in the new coordinates @xmath are represented as well
determined functions of class @xmath of the old components @xmath in the
old coordinates @xmath , of the functions @xmath and of their sth
derivatives @xmath , that is, the new components @xmath of the object
can be represented by equations of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

iii) The functions @xmath have the group properties, that is, they
satisfy  the following relations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.68)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.69)
  -- -------- -- --------

The coordinate transformation law @xmath characterizes the geometric
object. In case that the function @xmath contains only @xmath and the
partial derivatives of @xmath with respect to @xmath the geometric
object is said to be a differential geometric object .

Furthermore, we say that a geometric object is linear if for the
transformation law @xmath it holds

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.70)
  -- -------- -- --------

When the transformation law is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.71)
  -- -------- -- --------

we say that the geometric object is a linear homogeneous geometric
object . One important calss of linear homogeneous geometric objects are
the tensors.

##### 2.7.1 Lie Derivative

Let @xmath be a geometric object in @xmath with transformation law (
2.67 ) and consider the infinitesimal transformation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.72)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are the components of the infinitesimal generator. From the
transformation law ( 2.67 ), the geometric object in the coordinate
system @xmath is @xmath . The Lie derivative of the geometric object
@xmath with respect to @xmath is defined as follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.73)
  -- -------- -- --------

In order for the Lie derivative of a geometric object to be again a
geometric object (not necessarily of the same type) it is necessary and
sufficient that the geometric object be linear [ 21 ] .

By definition, the Lie derivative of a geometric object depends on the
transformation law. The transformation law ( 2.67 ) for functions is
@xmath , hence, under the point transformation ( 2.72 ) we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

From ( 2.73 ) the Lie derivative of functions @xmath along the vector
field @xmath is computed to be

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The transformation law for a tensor field @xmath of rank @xmath is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the Jacobian of the transformation. Thus, from ( 2.73 ),
the Lie derivative of @xmath with respect to @xmath is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.74)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

In case of vector fields @xmath and 1-forms @xmath expression ( 2.74 )
gives

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.75)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.76)
  -- -------- -- --------

For a second order tensor @xmath , expression ( 2.74 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.77)
  -- -------- -- --------

The connection coefficients @xmath are linear differential geometric
objects with transformation law

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.78)
  -- -------- -- --------

Connection coefficients have different transformation law from tensor
fields, that is, the Lie derivative @xmath will be different from that
of tensors. Applying ( 2.73 ),we find that the Lie derivative @xmath is
expressed as follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.79)
  -- -------- -- --------

In case of symmetric connection @xmath condition ( 2.79 ) can be written
in the equivalent form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.80)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the curvature tensor and the semicolon @xmath means
covariant derivative.

###### Collineations

In section 2.2.2 we gave the conditions under which a function is
invariant under a one parameter point transformation. Similarly for
linear (homogeneous) differential geometric objects there is the
following definition.

###### Definition 2.7.2

A linear differential geometric object @xmath is invariant under a one
parameter point transformation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.81)
  -- -------- -- --------

if and only if @xmath at all points where the one parameter point
transformation acts. Equivalently, the Lie derivative of @xmath the
geometric object @xmath with respect to the infinitesimal generator of (
2.81 ) vanishes, that is, @xmath

A direct result which arises from the definition of the Lie derivative
and the transformation law of linear differential geometric objects is
that if a linear differential geometric object @xmath is invariant under
the transformation ( 2.81 ), then there exist a coordinate system with
respect to which the components of @xmath are independent of one of the
coordinates.

One can generalize the concept of symmetry in the sense that one does
not require the Lie derivative to be equal to zero, but to another
tensor. That is, the Lie derivative of the linear differential geometric
object @xmath with respect to the infinitesimal generator @xmath is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath has the same numbers of components and symmetries of the
indices with @xmath In this case the infinitesimal generator @xmath is
said to be a collineation of @xmath the type of collineations being
defined by @xmath . Collineations are a powerful tool in the study of
the geometric properties of Riemannian manifolds.

In Riemannian geometry, the geometric object @xmath can be the metric
tensor @xmath or any other geometric object defined from it (e.g. the
connection coefficients).

###### Definition 2.7.3

All collineations involving geometric objects @xmath derived from the
metric @xmath of a Riemannian space shall be called geometric
collineations . In particular, the collineation defined by the metric
@xmath is called the generic collineation because any other geometric
collineation can be written in terms of it. Furthermore, the geometric
collineations can be written in terms of the irreducible parts @xmath as
follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.82)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the function @xmath is called the conformal factor and @xmath is a
symmetric traceless tensor .

The role of the quantities @xmath is important because they can be used
as the variables in terms of which one can study any geometric
collineation. To do that, one has to express the Lie derivative of any
metric tensor in terms of the generic symmetry variables @xmath and
their derivatives.

In the following we shall be interested in geometric collineations,
particularly in the collineations of the metric and of the connection
coefficients of a Riemannian space.

##### 2.7.2 Motions of Riemannian spaces

Consider an n dimensional Riemannian space @xmath with line element

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.83)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the metric tensor.

###### Definition 2.7.4

The point transformation ( 2.81 ) is called a motion of @xmath if and
only if the line element is invariant under the action of ( 2.81 ).
Equivalently, the Lie derivative of the metric tensor @xmath with
respect to the infinitesimal generator @xmath of ( 2.81 ) vanishes, i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.84)
  -- -------- -- --------

The point transformations ( 2.81 ) which are motions of @xmath form a
group named the group of motions . Since @xmath is a metric, condition (
2.84 ) can be written in the equivalent form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.85)
  -- -------- -- --------

This equation is known as Killing equation and @xmath is called an
isometry or Killing Vector (KV). The KVs of a metric form a Lie algebra,
which is called the Killing algebra .

Motions are important in physics. For instance, the Euclidian
space admits as motions the group of translations and the group of
rotations @xmath and this implies the conservation of linear and angular
momentum respectively. As a second example in Cosmology the assumption
that the universe is isotropic and homogeneous about all points leads to
the Friedmann Robertson Walker (FRW) spacetime.

The maximum dimension of the Killing algebra that @xmath can admit is
given in the following theorem.

###### Theorem 2.7.5

If an n dimensional Riemannian space @xmath admits a Killing algebra
@xmath then, @xmath

A Riemannian space which admits a Killing algebra of dimension @xmath
is called a maximally symmetric space . For example, the Euclidian space
@xmath and the Minkowski spacetime @xmath are maximally symmetric
spaces.

A special class of KVs are the gradient KVs. A KV @xmath is called
gradient iff @xmath , that is,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For every gradient KV @xmath there exists a function @xmath so @xmath
and @xmath

###### Theorem 2.7.6

If @xmath admits @xmath gradient KVs @xmath then, @xmath is called a
@xmath decomposable space and in this case there exists a coordinate
system in which the line element ( 2.83 ) can be written in the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , @xmath are constants.

###### Example 2.7.7

Compute the KVs of the Euclidian sphere with line element

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.86)
  -- -------- -- --------

Solution: In order to find the KVs we solve the Killing equation ( 2.85
). This leads to the system of equations

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

whose solution are the elements of the @xmath Lie algebra (see example
2.2.8 ).

The 2D Euclidian sphere ( 2.86 ) admits a three dimensional Killing
algebra, hence, it is a maximally symmetric space. Moreover, all spaces
of constant curvature are maximally symmetric spaces.

###### Conformal motions

When the point transformation ( 2.81 ) does not change the angle between
two directions at a point, the transformation ( 2.81 ) is called a
conformal motion . Technically we have the following definition.

###### Definition 2.7.8

The infinitesimal generator @xmath of the point transformation ( 2.81 )
is called Conformal Killing Vector (CKV) if the Lie derivative of the
metric @xmath with respect to @xmath is a multiple of @xmath . That is
if,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.87)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . In the case where @xmath @xmath is a special CKV (sp.CKV)
⁹ ⁹ 9 For the conformal factor of a sp.CKV holds @xmath that is, @xmath
is a gradient KV. A Riemannian space admits a sp.CKV if and only if
admits a gradient KV and a gradient HV [ 22 ] . and if @xmath constant,
@xmath is a Homothetic Killing Vector (HV).

The CKVs of a metric form a Lie algebra, which is called the c onformal
algebra , @xmath . Obviously the KVs and the homothetic vector are
elements of the conformal algebra @xmath . If @xmath is the algebra of
HVs (including the algebra @xmath of KVs), then the following theorem
applies.

###### Theorem 2.7.9

Let @xmath be an n dimensional Riemannian space, @xmath which admits a
conformal algebra @xmath , a homothetic algebra @xmath and a Killing
algebra @xmath then

i) @xmath .

ii) for arbitrary @xmath , @xmath then @xmath ; that is, @xmath admits
at most one HV.

iii) @xmath admits an infinite dimentional conformal algebra @xmath ,

iv) for @xmath , @xmath

In the following by the term proper conformal algebra we mean the
algebra of CKVs which are not HV/KVs. A generalization of theorem 2.7.6
for spaces which admit a gradient CKV is the following.

###### Theorem 2.7.10

If @xmath admits a gradient CKV then there exists a coordinate system in
which the line element can be written as follows

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath . In these coordinates the CKV is @xmath with conformal
factor @xmath . In the case in which @xmath then @xmath , hence, @xmath
becomes HV and if @xmath , @xmath becomes KV.

Two metrics @xmath are conformally related if @xmath where the function
@xmath is the conformal factor . If @xmath is a CKV of the metric @xmath
so that @xmath then @xmath is also a CKV of the metric @xmath , that is
@xmath with conformal factor @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.88)
  -- -------- -- --------

The last relation implies that two conformally related metrics have the
same conformal algebra, but with different subalgebras; that is, a KV
for one may be proper CKV for the other. This is an important
observation which shall be useful later. A special class of conformally
related metrics are the conformally flat metrics. A space @xmath is
conformally flat if the metric @xmath of @xmath satisfies the relation
@xmath where @xmath is the metric of a flat space which has the same
signature with @xmath .

For conformally flat spaces the following proposition aplies.

###### Proposition 2.7.11

Let @xmath be an n-dimensional Riemannian space, @xmath

i) If @xmath is conformally flat then @xmath admits a conformal algebra
of dimension @xmath .

ii) A three dimensional space is conformally flat if the Cotton-York
tensor

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

vanishes.

iii) @xmath @xmath is conformally flat if the Weyl tensor

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

vanishes.

iv) If @xmath @xmath is a maximally symmetric space then @xmath is
conformally flat.

v) All two dimensional spaces are conformally flat .

A result which will be used in subsequent sections is the following.

###### Example 2.7.12 (The conformal algebra of the flat space.)

Consider a flat space of dimension @xmath with metric

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The conformal algebra of the space consists of the following vectors
@xmath gradient KVs,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

@xmath non gradient KVs (rotations). @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

one gradient HV @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

@xmath special CKVs

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath with conformal factor @xmath and @xmath

For @xmath the flat space does not admit proper (non special) CKVs.

For @xmath the vector field

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is the generic CKV, that is, it includes the KVs, the HV, and the CKVs.

##### 2.7.3 Symmetries of the connection

Let @xmath be the generator of an infinitesimal transformation of ( 2.81
). In a Riemannian space with metric @xmath we have the identity

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.89)
  -- -------- -- --------

If @xmath is a HV or KV then from ( 2.89 ) follows that @xmath vanishes,
which implies that the @xmath are invariant under the action of
transformation ( 2.81 ).

###### Definition 2.7.13

The infinitesimal generator @xmath of the point transformation ( 2.81 )
caries a geodesic into a geodesic and also preserves the affine
parameter iff the Lie derivative of connection coefficients @xmath with
respect to @xmath vanishes, that is iff

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.90)
  -- -------- -- --------

The infinitesimal generator @xmath is called an Affine Killing vector or
Affine collineation (AC).

ACs of @xmath form a Lie algebra, which is called Affine algebra ,
@xmath . Obviously the homothetic algebra ¹⁰ ¹⁰ 10 Note that the proper
CKVs do not satisfy condition ( 2.90 ). @xmath is a subalgebra of @xmath
, @xmath We shall say that a spacetime admits proper ACs when @xmath .

For instance, in the case of flat space condition ( 2.90 ) becomes
@xmath therefore, the general solution is @xmath where @xmath are @xmath
constants. Therefore the flat space admits a @xmath dimensional Affine
algebra (including the KVs and the HV). We have the inverse result.

###### Theorem 2.7.14

If an n dimensional Riemannian space @xmath admits an Affine algebra
@xmath and @xmath , then @xmath is a flat space.

A generalization of affine symmetry which is of interest is the
Projective collineation.

###### Definition 2.7.15

The infinitesimal generator @xmath of the point transformation ( 2.81 )
is called a Projective Collineation (PC) if there exists a function ¹¹
¹¹ 11 In general, @xmath is PC if there exists a one form @xmath
such that @xmath In  a Riemannian space, the one form @xmath is
necessarily closed, that is, there exist a function @xmath such as
@xmath @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.91)
  -- -------- -- --------

or equivalently

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The function @xmath is called the projective function . If the
projective function satisfies the condition @xmath then we say that
@xmath is a special PC (sp.PC). Projective transformations transform the
system of geodesics (auto parallel curves) of @xmath into the same
system but they do not preserve the affine parameter.

The PCs of @xmath form a Lie algebra which is called Projective algebra
, @xmath . The affine algebra @xmath is a subalgebra of @xmath , @xmath

In flat space condition ( 2.91 ) gives the generic projective
collineation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath , @xmath are @xmath constants.

###### Theorem 2.7.16

If an n dimensional Riemannian space @xmath admits a projective algebra
@xmath then @xmath ). In case @xmath @xmath then @xmath is a maximally
symmetric space [ 23 ] .

Some useful propositions for the existence of sp. PCs are the following
[ 23 , 24 , 25 ] .

###### Proposition 2.7.17

Let @xmath be an n dimensional Riemannian space, then

i) If @xmath admits a @xmath dimensional Lie algebra of sp.PCs then also
admits @xmath gradient KVs and a gradient HV and if @xmath the space is
flat (the reverse also holds true).

ii) A maximally symmetric space which admits a proper AC or a sp.PC is a
flat space.

A Riemannian space is possible to admit more general collineations, e.g.
Curvature collineations. A full classification of the collineations of a
Riemannian space (with definite or indefinite metric) can be found in [
26 ] . A summary of the above definitiosn is given in Table 2.1 .

We note that the Lie symmetries @xmath of the free particle form the
projective algebra of the two dimensional Euclidian space. Therefore,
the natural question which arises is the following:

Is there any connection between the Lie symmetries of differential
equations of second order and collineations?

In the following chapters this will be confirmed and will be used to
apply the Lie symmetries of DEs in various areas of Geometry and
Physics.

## Part II Symmetries of ODEs

### Chapter 3 Lie symmetries of geodesic equations

#### 3.1 Introduction

In a Riemannian space the affinely parameterized geodesics are
determined uniquely by the metric. Therefore one should expect a close
relation between the geodesics as a set of homogeneous ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) linear in the highest order term and
quadratic non-linear in first order terms, and the metric as a second
order symmetric tensor. A system of such ODEs is characterized (perhaps
not fully) by its Lie symmetries and a metric by its collineations.
Therefore it is reasonable to expect that the Lie symmetries of the
system of geodesics of a metric will be closely related with the
collineations of the metric. That such a relation exists it is easy to
see by the following simple example. Consider on the Euclidian plane a
family of straight lines parallel to the @xmath axis. These curves can
be considered either as the integral curves of the ODE @xmath or as the
geodesics of the Euclidian metric @xmath . Subsequently consider a
symmetry operation defined by a reshuffling of these lines without
preserving necessarily their parametrization. According to the first
interpretation this symmetry operation is a Lie symmetry of the ODE
@xmath and according to the second interpretation it is a (special)
projective symmetry of the Euclidian two dimensional metric.

What has been said for a Riemannian space can be generalized to a space
in which there is only a linear connection. In this case the geodesics
are called autoparallels (or paths) and they comprise again a system of
ODEs linear in the highest order term and quadratic non-linear in the
first order terms. In this case one is looking for relations between the
Lie symmetries of the autoparallels and the projective or affine
collineations of the connection.

The above matters have been discussed extensively in a series of
interesting papers. Classic is the work of Katzin and Levin [ 27 , 28 ,
29 ] . Important contributions have also been done by Aminova [ 30 , 31
, 32 , 33 , 34 ] , Prince and Crampin [ 35 ] and many others. More
recent is the work of Feroze et al [ 36 ] . In [ 36 ] they have
considered the KVs of the metric and their relation to the Lie
symmetries of the system of affinely parameterized geodesics of
maximally symmetric spaces of low dimension. In the same paper a
conjecture is made, which essentially says that the maximally symmetric
spaces of non-vanishing curvature do not admit further Lie symmetries.

In the following we consider the set of autoparallels - not necessarily
affinely parameterized - of a symmetric connection. We find that the
major symmetry condition relates the Lie symmetries with the special
projective symmetries of the connection. A similar result has been
obtained by Prince and Crampin in [ 35 ] using the bundle formulation of
second order ODEs.

Furthermore, because the geodesic equations follow from the variation of
the geodesic Lagrangian defined by the metric and due to the fact that
the Noether symmetries are a subgroup of the Lie group of Lie symmetries
of these equations, one should expect a relation / identification of the
Noether symmetries of this Lagrangian with the projective collineations
of the metric or with its degenerates. Recent work in this direction has
been by Bokhari et all [ 37 , 38 ] in which the relation of the Noether
symmetries with the KVs of some special spacetimes is discussed.

In section 3.2 we derive the Lie symmetry conditions for a general
system of second order ODE polynomial in the first derivatives. In
section 3.4 we apply these conditions in the special case of Riemannian
spaces and in Theorem 3.4.1 we give the Lie symmetry vectors in terms of
the special projective collineations of the metric and their
degenerates. In section 3.4.1 we give the second result of this work,
that is Theorem 3.4.2 , which relates the Noether symmetries of the
geodesic Lagrangian defined by the metric with the homothetic algebra of
the metric and comment on the results obtained so far in the literature.
Finally in section 3.5 we apply the results to various cases and
eventually we give the Lie symmetries, the Noether symmetries and the
associated conserved quantities of Einstein spaces, the Gödel spacetime,
the Taub spacetime and the Friedman Robertson Walker spacetimes.

#### 3.2 The Lie symmetry conditions in an affine space

We consider the system of ODEs:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath are the connection coefficients of the space and @xmath are
smooth functions completely symmetric in the lower indices and derive
the Lie point symmetry conditions in geometric form using the standard
approach. Equation ( 3.1 ) is quite general and covers most of the
standard cases autonomous and non autonomous equations. For instance
for all @xmath equation ( 3.1 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

which are the geodesic equations. In case @xmath and @xmath equation (
3.1 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

which are the equations of motions of a particle in a curved space under
the action of the force @xmath . Furthermore because the @xmath ’s are
not assumed to be symmetric, the results are valid in a space with
torsion. Obviously they hold in a Riemannian space provided the
connection coefficients are given in terms of the Christofell symbols.

Following, the standard procedure (see e.g. [ 1 , 3 ] ) we find that the
Lie symmetry conditions for the values of @xmath are ¹ ¹ 1 The detailed
calculations are given in Appendix 3.A .

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.4)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.5)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.6)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.7)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

and for @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (3.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

From the above general relations it is possible to extract the Lie
symmetry conditions for the various values of functions @xmath . For
example the Lie symmetry conditions for the geodesic equations ( 3.2 )
are as follows.

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.9)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.10)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.11)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.12)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Moreover, the symmetry conditions for the system ( 3.3 ) are

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.13)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.14)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.15)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.16)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

In the same manner we work for more terms of @xmath We note the
appearance of the term @xmath in these expressions.

#### 3.3 Lie symmetries of autoparallel equation

Consider a @xmath manifold @xmath of dimension @xmath , endowed with a
@xmath symmetric ² ² 2 The coefficients @xmath in general are not
symmetric in the lower indices. In the autoparallel equation ( 3.17 )
the antisymmetric part of @xmath (the torsion) does not play a role.
connection. In a local coordinate system @xmath the connection @xmath
and the autoparallels of the connection are defined by the requirement

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a parameter along the paths. When @xmath vanishes, we
say that the autoparallels are affinely parameterized and in this case
@xmath is called an affine parameter , that is one has ( 3.2 ). Consider
the infinitesimal transformation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

with infinitesimal generator

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

The autoparallels ( 3.17 ) are invariant under transformation ( 3.18 )
if

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the second prolongation of ( 3.19 ). For @xmath for
@xmath and @xmath and from conditions ( 3.4 )-( 3.8 ) we have the Lie
symmetry conditions for the autoparallel equations ( 3.17 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

Define the quantity

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then condition ( 3.23 ) is written @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

If we consider the vector @xmath (which does not have components along
@xmath ) we compute

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

hence ( 3.26 ) is written

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

We observe that this condition is the condition for a projective
collineation of the connection @xmath along the symmetry vector @xmath
and with projecting function @xmath . Concerning the other conditions we
note that ( 3.22 ) can be written in covariant form as follows:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the covariant derivative with respect to @xmath of the
vector @xmath Condition ( 3.24 ) implies that @xmath is a gradient KV of
the metric of the space @xmath . Condition ( 3.21 ) is obviously in
covariant form with respect to the index @xmath

We arrive at the following conclusion.

a) The conditions for the Lie symmetries of the autoparallel equations (
3.17 ) are covariant equations because if we consider the connection in
the augmented @xmath space @xmath , all components of @xmath which
contain an index along the direction of @xmath vanish, therefore the
partial derivatives with respect to @xmath can be replaced with
covariant derivatives with respect to @xmath .

b) Equation ( 3.21 ) gives the functional dependence of @xmath on @xmath
and the non-affine parametrization function @xmath .

c) Equation ( 3.24 ) gives that the vector @xmath is a gradient Killing
vector of the @xmath dimensional space @xmath .

d) Equation ( 3.22 ) relates the functional dependence of @xmath and
@xmath in terms of @xmath .

e) Equation ( 3.23 ) is the most important equation for our purpose,
because it states that the symmetry vector ( 3.18 ) is an affine
collineation in the jet space @xmath because it preserves both the
geodesics and their affine parameter. In the space @xmath the vectors
@xmath are projective collineations because they preserve the geodesics
but not necessarily their parametrization.

In the following we restrict our considerations to the case of
Riemannian connections that is the @xmath are symmetric and the
covariant derivative of the metric vanishes.

#### 3.4 Lie and Noether symmetries of geodesic equations

We compute the Lie symmetry vectors of geodesics equations ( 3.2 ) with
affine parametrization; that is, we assume @xmath and @xmath The later
is a reasonable assumption because the @xmath ’s are computed in terms
of the metric which does not depend on the parameter @xmath . Under
these assumptions the symmetry conditions for the geodesics equations (
3.2 ) are ( 3.9 )-( 3.12 ). We proceed with the solution of this system
of equations ³ ³ 3 See also [ 35 ] Table II. .

Equation ( 3.9 ) implies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are arbitrary differentiable vector fields.

The solution of equation ( 3.12 ) is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are arbitrary functions of the affine parameter @xmath and
@xmath is a function whose gradient is a gradient KV, i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

The index @xmath runs through the number of gradient KVs of the metric.
Condition ( 3.10 ) gives

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

Because the left hand side is a function of @xmath only, we must have

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.33)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.34)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Replacing in ( 3.32 ) we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have lowered the index because the connection is metric (i.e.
@xmath . The last equation implies that the vector @xmath is a conformal
Killing vector with conformal factor @xmath . Because @xmath this vector
is a gradient CKV.

We continue with condition ( 3.11 ) and replace @xmath from ( 3.29 )

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath               
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.36)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.37)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

The last two equations imply that the vectors @xmath @xmath are special
projective collineations or affine collineations of the metric - or one
of their specializations - with projective functions @xmath and @xmath
or zero respectively. Note that relations ( 3.36 ), ( 3.37 ) remain true
if we add a KV to the vectors @xmath @xmath , therefore these vectors
are determined up to a KV ⁴ ⁴ 4 Because @xmath is a projective
collineation and a CKV it must be a HV. .

It is well known that in a Riemannian space a CKV @xmath with conformal
factor @xmath satisfies the identity:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

Applying this identity to the CKV @xmath we find:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

This implies that @xmath is a gradient HV (not necessarily proper) with
homothetic factor @xmath . Furthermore ( 3.35 ) implies:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.40)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a non-gradient KV.

We continue with the special projective collineation vector @xmath . For
this vector we use the property that for a symmetric connection the
following identity, holds

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Replacing the left hand side from ( 3.37 ) we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

Contracting the indices @xmath we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

which implies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath constant. In case this vector is an affine collineation
then @xmath Using the above results we find for @xmath

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

We summarize the above results in the following Theorem.

###### Theorem 3.4.1

The Lie symmetry vector

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

of the equation of geodesics ( 3.2 ) in a Riemannian space is generated
from the elements of the special projective algebra as follows.

Case A. The metric admits gradient KVs. Then

a. The function

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are constants and the index @xmath runs along
the number of gradient KVs

b. The vector

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the vector @xmath is a gradient HV with conformal factor @xmath
(if it exists), @xmath is a non-gradient KV of the metric and @xmath is
either a special projective collineation with projection function @xmath
or an AC and @xmath in ( 3.44 ).

Case B. The metric does not admit gradient KVs. Then

a. The function

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

b. The vector

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a gradient HV with conformal factor @xmath @xmath is a
non-gradient KV of the metric and @xmath is an AC. If in addition the
metric does not admit a gradient HV, then

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.48)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.49)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

##### 3.4.1 Noether symmetries and conservation laws

In a Riemannian space the equations of geodesics ( 3.2 ) are produced
from the geodesic Lagrangian:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

The infinitesimal generator

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

is a Noether symmetry of Lagrangian ( 3.50 ) if there exists a smooth
function @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is the first prolongation of @xmath We compute

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Replacing the total derivatives in the rhs

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

we find that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The term

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Finally the Noether symmetry condition ( 3.52 ) is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This relation is an identity hence the coefficient of each power of
@xmath must vanish. This results in the equations:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.53)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.54)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.55)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.56)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Condition ( 3.53 ) gives @xmath .

Condition ( 3.56 ) implies @xmath and then condition ( 3.53 ) gives that
@xmath is of the form:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then from ( 3.54 ) follows that @xmath must be at most linear in @xmath
Hence @xmath must be at most a function of @xmath Furthermore from (
3.54 ) follows that @xmath is at most a CKV with conformal factor @xmath
where @xmath are constants. We consider various cases.

Case 1: Suppose @xmath constant= @xmath . Then @xmath is a KV of the
metric which is independent of @xmath This implies that either @xmath
and @xmath constant @xmath or that @xmath is a gradient KV. In this case
the Noether symmetry vector is:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is a non-gradient KV of @xmath

Case 2: Suppose @xmath Then @xmath is a HV of the metric @xmath with
homothetic factor @xmath . Then @xmath , @xmath constant @xmath where
@xmath is a HV of @xmath with homothetic factor @xmath not necessarily a
gradient HV. In this case the Noether symmetry vector is:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Case 3: @xmath Then @xmath is a HV of the metric @xmath (the variable
@xmath cancels) with homothetic factor @xmath Again @xmath is a gradient
HV with homothetic factor @xmath and the Noether symmetry vector is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Therefore we have the result.

###### Theorem 3.4.2

The Noether Symmetries of the geodesic Lagrangian follow from the KVs
and the HV of the metric @xmath as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.58)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

with corresponding gauge function

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are the @xmath gradient KVs, @xmath are the @xmath
non-gradient KVs, @xmath is a HV not necessarily gradient and @xmath is
the gradient HV (if it exists) of the metric @xmath .

The importance of Theorems 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 are that one is able to
compute the Lie symmetries and the Noether symmetries of the geodesic
equations in a Riemannian space by computing the corresponding
collineation vectors avoiding the cumbersome formulation of the Lie
symmetry method. It is also possible to use the inverse approach and
prove that a space does not admit KVs, HVs, ACs and special PCs by using
the calculational approach of the Lie symmetry method (assisted with
algebraic manipulation programmes) and avoid the hard approach of
Differential Geometric methods. In Section 3.5 we demonstrate the use of
the above results.

###### Noether Integrals of geodesic equations

We know that, if the infinitesimal generator ( 3.51 ) is a Noether
symmetry with Noether function @xmath then the quantity:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

is a First Integral of @xmath which satisfies @xmath @xmath . For the
Lagrangian defined by the metric @xmath i.e. @xmath we compute:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

In ( 3.58 ) we have computed the generic form of the Noether symmetry
and the associated Noether function for this Lagrangian. Substituting
into ( 3.61 ) we find the following expression for the generic First
Integral of the geodesic equations:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (3.62)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

From the generic expression we obtain the following first integrals ⁵ ⁵
5 GHV stands for gradient HV

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.63)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.64)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.65)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.66)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.67)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.68)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

We conclude that the first Integrals of the Noether symmetry vectors of
the geodesic equations are:

a) linear, the @xmath

b) quadratic, the @xmath

These results are compatible with the corresponding results of Katzin
and Levine [ 29 ] .

In a number of recent papers [ 39 , 40 , 41 ] , the authors study the
relation between the Noether symmetries of the geodesic Lagrangian. They
also make a conjecture concerning the relation between the Noether
symmetries and the conformal algebra of spacetime and concentrate
especially on conformally flat spacetimes. In [ 41 ] it is also claimed
that the author has found new conserved quantities for spaces of
different curvatures, which seem to be of non Noetherian character.
Obviously due to the above results the conjecture/results in these
papers should be revised and the word ‘conformal’ should be replaced
with the word ‘homothetic’.

#### 3.5 Applications

We apply the general Theorems 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 in various curved spaces
where we determine the Lie and the Noether symmetries of the
corresponding geodesic equations.

##### 3.5.1 The geodesic symmetries of Einstein spaces

Suppose @xmath is a projective collineation with projection function
@xmath such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For a proper Einstein space @xmath we have @xmath from which follows [
42 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.69)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the contracted Bianchi identity

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

it follows that in an Einstein space of dimension ⁶ ⁶ 6 Recall that all
two dimensional spaces are Einstein spaces. @xmath the curvature scalar
@xmath constant and ( 3.69 ) reduces to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It follows that if @xmath generates either an affine or a special
projective collineation, then @xmath Hence @xmath reduces to a KV. This
means that proper Einstein spaces do not admit HV, ACs, special PCs and
gradient KVs ( [ 21 , 23 ] )

The above results and Theorem 3.4.1 lead to the following result.

###### Proposition 3.5.1

The Lie symmetries of the geodesic equations in a proper Einstein space
with curvature scalar @xmath @xmath are given by the vectors

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is a nongradient KV and @xmath are constants

For the Noether symmetries of Einstein spaces we have the following

###### Proposition 3.5.2

The Noether symmetries of the geodesic equations in a proper Einstein
space with curvature scalar @xmath @xmath are given by the vectors

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proposition 3.5.1 extends and amends the conjecture of [ 36 ] to the
more general case of Einstein spaces.

We apply the results to the maximally symmetric space of Euclidian 2d
sphere.

###### Euclidian 2d sphere

The geodesic Lagrangian of the Euclidian 2d sphere is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the geodesic equations are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The Euclidian 2d sphere is an Einstein space with curvature scalar
@xmath , therefore propositions ( 3.5.1 ) and ( 3.5.2 ) apply. The KVs
of the Euclidian 2d sphere are the elements of the @xmath Lie algebra
(See example 2.7.7 )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Consequently the Lie symmetries of geodesic equations are the elements
of the @xmath plus the vectors @xmath . @xmath Likewise @xmath the
Noether symmetries are the elements of @xmath plus the vector @xmath .
The corresponding Noether integrals are

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

and the Hamiltonian constant.

##### 3.5.2 The geodesic symmetries of Gödel spacetime

The Gödel metric in Cartesian coordinates is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The geodesic Lagrangian is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.70)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath means @xmath where @xmath is an affine parameter. The
geodesic equations are

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

The special projective algebra of the Gödel metric has as follows:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is a gradient KV @xmath , @xmath are non gradient KVs and
@xmath is a proper AC. The Gödel spacetime does not admit proper sp.PC [
24 ] .

Applying theorem ( 3.4.1 ) we find that, the Gödel spacetime admits ten
Lie point symmetries as follows

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

whose Lie algebra is given in Table 3.1 .

There are two Lie subalgebras. One spanned by the vectors @xmath and a
second spanned by the vectors @xmath . It can be shown that the first
subalgebra consists of the Noether symmetries of the Lagrangian ( 3.70
). The corresponding Noether integrals are

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The Noether constant corresponding to the Noether symmetry @xmath is the
total energy i.e. the Hamiltonian.

##### 3.5.3 The geodesic symmetries of Taub spacetime

Consider the Taub spacetime with line element

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.71)
  -- -------- -- --------

The geodesic Lagrangian is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.72)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the geodesic equations are

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

In order to find the Lie symmetries of the geodesic equations for the
Taub spacetime ( 3.71 ) we need to have the special projective algebra
of ( 3.71 ). The spacetime ( 3.71 ) admits a five dimensional special
projective algebra ⁷ ⁷ 7 The spacetime ( 3.71 ) does not admit proper AC
or sp.PC. which consists from four non gradient KVs @xmath and a non
gradient HV @xmath [ 43 ] .

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Applying theorem ( 3.4.1 ) we find that the geodesic equations of ( 3.71
) admit seven Lie symmetries

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

with Lie algebra is given in Table 3.1 .

Similarly from Theorem 3.4.2 we have that the geodesic Lagrangian ( 3.72
) admits a six dimensional Noether algebra, with elements

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and correspoding Noether integrals

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

##### 3.5.4 The geodesic symmetries of a 1+3 decomposable spacetime
metric

We consider next the metric which is a 1+3 decomposable, that is it has
the form:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.73)
  -- -------- -- --------

where Greek indices take the values @xmath It is well known [ 44 ] that
this metric admits 15 CKVs. Seven of these vectors are KVs (the six
nongradient KVs of the 3-metric @xmath plus the gradient KV @xmath and
nine proper CKVs. The vectors of this conformal algebra are shown in
Table 3.3 .

According to Theorem 3.4.2 this metric admits the following Noether
symmetries

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with first integrals

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

The Lie symmetries of the geodesic equations of ( 3.73 ) are the Noether
symmetries plus the vectors @xmath .

##### 3.5.5 The geodesic symmetries of the FRW metrics

In a recent paper Bokhari and Kara [ 38 ] studied the Lie symmetries of
the conformally flat Friedman Robertson Walker (FRW) metric with the
view to understand how Noether symmetries compare with conformal Killing
vectors. More specifically they considered the conformally flat
FRW metric ⁸ ⁸ 8 The second metric @xmath they consider is the Minkowski
metric whose Lie and Noether symmetries are well known.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and found that the Noether symmetries are the seven vectors

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath are the gradient KVs @xmath and @xmath are the three
nongradient KVs (generating @xmath ) whereas the vector @xmath counts
for the gauge freedom in the affine parametrization of the geodesics.
Therefore they confirm our Theorem 3.4.2 that the Noether vectors
coincide with the KVs and the HV of the metric. Furthermore their claim
that ‘ …the conformally transformed Friedman model admits additional
conservation laws not given by the Killing or conformal Killing vectors
’  is not correct.

In the following lines, we compute all the Noether point symmetries of
the FRW spacetimes. To do that we have to have the homothetic algebra of
these models [ 45 ] . There are two cases to consider, the conformally
flat models @xmath and the non conformally flat models ( @xmath .

In the following we need the conformal algebra of the flat metric, which
in Cartesian coordinates (See example 2.7.12 ) is given in Table 3.4 .

Case A : @xmath

The metric is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.74)
  -- -------- -- --------

For a general @xmath this metric admits the nongradient KVs @xmath (see
Table 4) and does not admit a HV. Therefore the Noether symmetries of
the geodesic Lagrangian

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

of the FRW metric ( 3.74 ) are:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with Noether integrals

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.75)
  -- -------- -- --------

Concerning the Lie symmetries we note that the FRW spacetimes do not
admit ACs [ 46 ] and furthermore does not admit gradient KVs. Therefore
they do not admit special PCs. The Lie symmetries of these spacetimes
are then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For special functions @xmath it is possible to have more KVs and HV. In
Table 3.5 we give the special forms of the scale factor @xmath and the
corresponding extra KVs and HV for @xmath .

From Table 3.5 we infer the following additional Noether symmetries of
the FRW-like Lagrangian for special forms of the scale factor

Case A(1): @xmath constant, the space is the 1+3 decomposable.

Case A(2) @xmath In this case the space is flat and admits as Lie point
symmetries the @xmath

Case A(3a) @xmath . In this case we have the additional non-gradient KVs
@xmath Therefore the Noether symmetries are:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with Noether Integrals

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The Lie symmetries are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Case A(3b) @xmath In this case we have the two nongradient KVs @xmath
The Noether Symmetries are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with Noether Integrals

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The Lie symmetries are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Case A(4a) @xmath . In this case we have the two additional nongradient
KVs @xmath The Noether Symmetries are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with Noether Integrals

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The Lie symmetries are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Case A(4b) @xmath we have the nongradient KV @xmath . The Noether
Symmetries are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with Noether Integrals

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The Lie symmetries are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Case B: @xmath

In this case the metric is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and admits three nongradient KVs @xmath and three nongradient KVs @xmath
. Therefore the Noether symmetries are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with Noether Integrals

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The Lie symmetries are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Again for special forms of the scale factor one obtains extra KVs and HV
as shown in Table 3.6 .

From Table 3.6 we have the following special cases.

Case B(1): @xmath constant. Then the space is the Minkowski space and
admits as Lie symmetries the @xmath

Case B(2): @xmath Then @xmath becomes a gradient HV @xmath Hence the
Noether symmetries are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with Noether Integrals

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The Lie symmetries are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Case B(3 ): @xmath Then @xmath we have four additional nongradient KVs,
the @xmath and @xmath and the Noether symmetries are:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with Noether Integrals

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The Lie symmetries are:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

#### 3.6 Conclusion

We derived the symmetry conditions for the admittance of a Lie point
symmetry by the equations of autoparallels (paths) in an affine space.
The important conclusion is that the Lie symmetry vector is an Affine
Collineation in the jet space @xmath ( it preserves both the
autoparallels and their parametrization) while in the space @xmath the
vectors @xmath are projective collineations (they preserve the
autoparallels but not necessarily their parametrization).

The symmetry conditions are applied to the geodesics of a Riemannian
space were they are solved and the generic Lie symmetry vector is
obtained in terms of the special projective algebra (and its
degeneracies KVs, HKV, ACs) of the metric. Furthermore we derived the
Noether symmetries of the geodesic Lagrangian and it was proved that
Noether symmetries are generateted from the homothetic algebra of the
metric. We applied the results to the case of Einstein spaces and
obtained the Lie symmetry vectors in terms of the KVs of the metric, in
agreement with the conjecture made in [ 36 ] .

Finally, the Lie and the Noether symmetries of the geodesic equations
were computed in the Gödel spacetime, the Taub spacetime and the
Friedman Robertson Walker spacetimes. In each case the Noether
symmetries were computed explicitly together with the corresponding
first integrals.

### Appendix 3.A The determining equations

Below we calculate the determining equations for the system ( 3.1 ). Let
@xmath be the infinitesimal generator of a one parameter point
transformation. @xmath is a Lie symmetry of ( 3.1 ) if the following
condition, holds

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.76)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is the second prolongation of @xmath and @xmath are the prolongation
functions

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath            
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Replacing @xmath from ( 3.1 ) we find eventually

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

We have computed the lhs of ( 3.76 ). It remains to compute the rhs

The second term

                       @xmath

The term @xmath can be written as

     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath

### Chapter 4 Motion on a curved space

#### 4.1 Introduction

The study of Lie point symmetries of a given system of ODEs consists of
two steps: (a) the determination of the conditions, which the components
of the Lie symmetry vectors must satisfy and (b) the solution of the
system of these conditions. These conditions can be quite involved, but
today it is possible to use algebraic computing programs to derive them
(for a review see [ 47 ] ). Therefore the essential part of the work is
the second step. For a small number of equations (say up to three) one
can possibly employ again computer algebra to look for a solution of the
system. However for a large number of equations such an attempt is
prohibitive and one has to go back to traditional methods to determine
the solution.

In Chapter 3 the Lie and the Noether point symmetries of the geodesic
equations were calculated in terms of the special projective algebra of
the space. The purpose of the present chapter is to extend the previous
results and to provide an alternative way to solve the system of Lie
symmetry conditions for the second order equations of the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here @xmath are general functions, a dot over a symbol indicates
derivation with respect to the parameter @xmath along the solution
curves and @xmath is a @xmath vector field. This type of equations is
important, because it contains the equations of motion of a dynamical
system in a Riemannian space, in which the functions @xmath are the
connection coefficients of the metric and @xmath being an affine
parameter along the trajectory. In the following we assume this
identification of @xmath ’s ¹ ¹ 1 Of course it is possible to look for a
metric for which a given set of @xmath are the connection coefficients,
or, even avoid the metric altogether. However we shall not attempt this
in the present work. For such an attempt see [ 9 ] . .

The key idea, which is proposed here, is to express the system of Lie
symmetry conditions of ( 4.1 ) in a Riemannian space in terms of
collineation (i.e. symmetry) conditions of the metric. If this is
achieved, then the Lie point symmetries of ( 4.1 ) will be related to
the collineations of the metric, hence their determination will be
transferred to the geometric problem of determining the generators of a
specific type of collineations of the metric. One then can use of
existing results of Differential Geometry on collineations to produce
the solution of the Lie symmetry problem.

The natural question to ask is: If the Lie symmetries of the dynamical
systems moving in a given Riemannian space are from the same set of
collineations of the space, how will one select the Lie symmetries of a
specific dynamical system? The answer is as follows. The left hand side
of Equation ( 4.1 ) contains the metric and its derivatives and it is
common to all dynamical systems moving in the same Riemannian space.
Therefore geometry (i.e. collineations) enters in the left hand side of
( 4.1 ) only. A dynamical system is defined by the force field @xmath
which enters into the right hand side of ( 4.1 ) only. We conclude that
there must exist constraint conditions, which will involve the
components of the collineation vectors and the force field @xmath ,
which will select the appropriate Lie symmetries for a specific
dynamical system.

Indeed Theorem 4.2.2 (see section 4.2 ) relates the Lie symmetry
generators of ( 4.1 ) with the elements of the special projective Lie
algebra of the space where motion occurs, and provides these necessary
constraint conditions.

What has been said for the Lie point symmetries of ( 4.1 ) applies also
to Noether symmetries. The Noether symmetries are Lie point symmetries
which satisfy the constraint

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Theorem 4.3.2 (see section 4.3 ) relates the generators of Noether
symmetries of ( 4.1 ) with the homothetic algebra of the metric and
provides the required constraint conditions.

In the following sections we apply Theorem 4.2.2 and Theorem 4.3.2 to
determine all two dimensional (section 4.4 ) and all three dimensional
(section 4.5 ) Newtonian dynamical systems moving under the action of a
general force @xmath which admit Lie and Noether point symmetries. In
section 4.6 we apply the results to determine the conservative dynamical
systems which move in a two-dimensional space of constant non-vanishing
curvature and admit Noether point symmetries. The case of a conservative
force has been addressed previously for the two dimensional case by Sen
[ 48 ] and more recently by Damianou et al [ 49 ] and for the three
dimensional by [ 50 ] @xmath As it will be shown both treatments are
incomplete. We demonstrate the use of the results in two cases. The
non-conservative Kepler - Ermakov system [ 51 , 52 , 53 ] and the case
of the Hènon Heiles type potentials [ 54 , 55 ] . In both cases we
recover and complete the existing results.

#### 4.2 Lie symmetries of a dynamical system in a Riemannian space

I section 3.2 the Lie symmetry conditions were calculated for a general
system of ODEs polynomial in the velocities, therefore the Lie symmetry
conditions (determining equations) for equation ( 4.1 ) with @xmath are

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

Equation ( 4.5 ) means that @xmath is a projective collineation of the
metric with projective function @xmath . Furthermore, equation ( 4.6 )
means that @xmath is a gradient KV of @xmath ; that is, @xmath is a
special projective collineation of the metric. Equation ( 4.3 ) gives ²
² 2 Recall that @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

This equation restricts @xmath further because it relates it directly to
the metric symmetries. Finally equation ( 4.4 ) gives

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

Equations ( 4.7 ),( 4.8 ) are the constraint conditions which relate the
components @xmath of the Lie point symmetry vector with the vector
@xmath .

###### Proposition 4.2.1

The Lie point symmetries of the dynamical system ( 4.1 ) where @xmath
are generated from the special projective algebra of the space where the
motion occurs.

In the case where the dynamical system ( 4.1 ) is autonomous and
conservative, that is, @xmath and @xmath is not a gradient KV of the
metric, the solution of the determining equations is given by the
following theorem (for a proof see Appendix 4.A ).

###### Theorem 4.2.2

The Lie point symmetries of the equations of motion of an autonomous
conservative system

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

in a general Riemannian space with metric @xmath are given in terms of
the generators @xmath of the special projective Lie algebra of the
metric @xmath as follows.
Case I Lie symmetries due to the affine algebra. The resulting Lie
symmetries are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are constants, provided the potential satisfies
the condition

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

Case IIa The Lie symmetries are generated by the gradient homothetic
algebra and @xmath . The Lie symmetries are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the function @xmath is the solution of the equation @xmath
provided the potential @xmath satisfies the condition

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

Case IIb The  Lie symmetries are generated by the gradient HV @xmath
where @xmath is a constant. In this case the potential is the gradient
HV of the metric and the Lie symmetry vectors are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

Case IIIa The  Lie symmetries due to the proper special projective
algebra. In this case the Lie symmetry vectors are (the index @xmath
counts the gradient KVs)

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the functions @xmath are solutions of the system of simultaneous
equations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

and in addition the potential satisfies the conditions

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.17)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.18)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Case IIIb Lie symmetries due to the proper special projective algebra
and @xmath where @xmath is a gradient HV and @xmath is a gradient KV.
The Lie symmetry vectors are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the functions @xmath and @xmath are computed from the relations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the potential satisfies the conditions

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.21)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.22)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

An immediate important application of Theorem 4.2.2 concerns the
important case of spaces of constant curvature. As we have seen already
(see also [ 23 ] ) the special projective algebra of a space of constant
curvature consists of non-gradient KVs only. Therefore we have the
following corollary.

###### Corollary 4.2.3

The Lie point symmetries of the equations of motion of an autonomous
conservative system ( 4.9 ) @xmath in a space of constant curvature are
elements of the non-gradient KVs algebra.

This implies that  in spaces of constant curvature  it is enough to
consider Case I only.

If the system ( 4.1 ) is autonomous but not conservative moving under
the action of the external force @xmath the previous results remain
valid except the cases IIb, IIIb which are not applicable. We emphasize
that (with appropriate adjustments) the results apply to affine spaces
in which there exists a connection @xmath but not necessarily a metric.

#### 4.3 Noether symmetries of a dynamical system in a Riemannian space

Consider a particle moving in a Riemannian space with metric @xmath
under the influence of the potential @xmath The Lagrangian describing
the motion of the particle is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

A Lie symmetry vector @xmath is a Noether symmetry of the Lagrangian if
it satisfies the condition

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the first prolongation of @xmath It can be shown that
condition ( 4.24 ) is equivalent to the system of equations:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.25)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.26)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.27)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.28)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Equation ( 4.28 ) implies @xmath , and then from ( 4.27 ) follows that
@xmath is a HV. Therefore we have the following result

###### Proposition 4.3.1

The Noether symmetries of the Lagrangian ( 4.23 ) are generated, from
the homothetic algebra of the metric @xmath of the space where motion
occurs.

In the case the potential is autonomous, that is @xmath the solution of
( 4.25 )-( 4.28 ) relates the Noether symmetries of ( 4.23 ) with the
elements of the homothetic algebra of the metric @xmath as follows.

###### Theorem 4.3.2

The Noether symmetries of an autonomous conservative dynamical system
moving in a Riemannian space with metric @xmath described by the
Lagrangian ( 4.23 ) are generated from the homothetic Lie algebra of the
metric @xmath as follows.

Case I. The KVs and the HV satisfy the condition:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Noether symmetry vector is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath

Case II. The metric admits the gradient KVs @xmath , the gradient HV
@xmath and the potential satisfies the condition

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this case the Noether symmetry vector and the Noether function are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the functions @xmath and @xmath ( @xmath ) are computed from the
relations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a constant.

In addition to the above there is also the standard Noether symmetry
@xmath .

The first integrals for the Noether symmetry vectors have as follows.

###### Proposition 4.3.3

For the Noether vector @xmath the Noether integral is the Hamiltonian
For the Noether vectors of Case I and Case II the Noether integrals are
respectively:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

For the case of motion in spaces of constant curvature we have the
following result.

###### Proposition 4.3.4

The Noether symmetry vectors of the Lagrangian ( 4.23 ) of an autonomous
conservative dynamical system moving in a space of constant curvature,
are generated by the non-gradient KVs of the space @xmath Hence only
Case I survives.

In the following sections, the autonomous non linear Newtonian systems
which admit Lie and Noether point symmetries are calculated with the use
of Theorems 4.2.2 and 4.3.2 .

#### 4.4 2D autonomous systems which admit Lie/Noether point symmetries

In this section we apply Theorems 4.2.2 and 4.3.2 to determine all
Newtonian dynamical systems with two degrees of freedom which admit at
least one Lie/Noether symmetry. The reason for considering this problem
is that a Lie/Noether symmetry lead to invariants/first integrals, which
can be used in many ways in order to study a given system of
differential equations e.g. to simplify, to determine the integrability
of the system etc. Because the Newtonian systems move in @xmath we need
to consider the generators of the special projective algebra of @xmath
and then use the constraint conditions for each case to determine the
functional form of the force field @xmath

We consider Cartesian coordinates so that the metric of the space is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In Table 4.1 we give the elements of the projective Lie algebra of
@xmath in Cartesian coordinates. We note that the special projective
algebra of the two dimensional Lorentz space

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is the same with that of the space @xmath with the difference that the
non gradient Killing vector is replaced with @xmath We shall use this
observation in later chapters where we study the Lie and the Noether
point symmetries in scalar field cosmology.

We examine the cases where the force @xmath (a) is non-conservative and
(b) is conservative. In certain cases the results are common to both
cases, however for clarity it is better to consider the two cases
separately. Finally for economy of space, easy reference and convenience
we present the results in the form of Tables.

In order to indicate how the results of the Tables are obtained we
consider Case I & II of theorem 4.2.2 . The Lie point symmetry vectors
for Case I are given by ( 4.10 ) i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are constants and @xmath is a vector of the
affine algebra of @xmath The force field must satisfy condition ( 4.11 )
i.e.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Writing

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we obtain a system of two differential equations involving the unknown
quantities @xmath and the known quantities @xmath For each vector @xmath
we replace @xmath from Table 4.1 and solve the system to compute @xmath
For example for the gradient KV @xmath we have @xmath and find the
solution @xmath @xmath where @xmath is a constant and @xmath are
arbitrary functions of their argument. Working similarly we determine
the form of the force field for all cases of Theorem 4.2.2 . The results
are given in Tables 4.2 and 4.3 .

Case III: @xmath is a special PC. There is only one dynamical system in
this case, which is the forced oscillator, acted upon the external force
@xmath , that is the system is conservative. As it can be seen from
Table 4.1 the Lie symmetry algebra of the forced oscillator is the
@xmath This result agrees with that of [ 6 ] .

Except the above three cases we have to consider the Lie point
symmetries generated from linear combinations of the vectors @xmath It
is found that the only new cases are the ones given given in Tables 4.14
and 4.15

We assume now @xmath to be conservative with potential function @xmath
In this case the results of the previous Tables differentiate. The
results of the calculations are given in Tables 4.4 , 4.16 and 4.17 .

As it was stated in section 4.1 the determination of all two dimensional
potentials which admit a Lie point symmetry has been addressed
previously in [ 48 ] and [ 49 ] . Our results contain the results of
both these papers and additionally some cases missing, mainly in the
linear combinations of the HV with the KVs.

##### 4.4.1 2D autonomous Newtonian systems which admit Noether
symmetries

Noether symmetries are associated with a Lagrangian. Therefore we
consider only the case in which the force @xmath is conservative.
Furthermore Noether symmetries are special Lie symmetries, hence we look
into the two dimensional potentials which admit a Lie point symmetry.
These potentials were determined in the previous section. We apply
Theorem 4.3.2 to these potentials and select the potentials which admit
a Noether symmetry. The calculations are similar to the ones for the Lie
point symmetries and are omitted. The results are listed in Tables 4.5
and 4.6 . In the next section we apply the same method to determine the
three dimensional autonomous Newtonian systems which admit Lie and
Noether symmetries.

#### 4.5 3D autonomous Newtonian systems admit Lie/Noether point
symmetries

In this section we determine all Newtonian systems with three degrees of
freedom which admit at least one Lie/Noether symmetry (except the
obvious symmetry @xmath ) @xmath In order to use Theorem 4.2.2 we need
the special projective algebra of the Euclidian 3D metric

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

This algebra consists of 15 vectors ³ ³ 3 These vectors are not all
linearly independent i.e. the HV and the rotations are linear
combinations of the ACs as follows: Six KVs @xmath one HV @xmath nine
ACs @xmath and three SPCs @xmath where ⁴ ⁴ 4 If @xmath then @xmath or
@xmath @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are spherical coordinates @xmath

In the computation of Lie symmetries we consider only the linearly
independent vectors of the special projective group. We do not consider
their linear combinations because the resulting Lie symmetries are too
many; on the other hand they can be computed in the standard way.

##### 4.5.1 3D autonomous Newtonian systems admit Lie point symmetries

In Tables 4.7 and 4.8 we list the Lie point symmetries and the
functional dependence of the components of the force for Case I and II
of Theorem 4.2.2 .

For the remaining Case III of Theorem 4.2.2 , we have that the force
@xmath admits Lie symmetries generated from the proper sp. PCs if the
force is the isotropic oscillator, that is, @xmath where @xmath are
constants. From Tables 4.7 and 4.8 we infer that the isotropic
oscillator admits 24 Lie point symmetries generating the @xmath , as
many as the free particle [ 6 ] .

In order to demonstrate the use of the above Tables let us require the
equations of motion of a Newtonian dynamical system which is invariant
under the @xmath algebra. We know [ 56 ] that @xmath is generated by the
following Lie symmetries

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

From Table 4.7 and from Table 4.8 we have that the force must be of the
form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

therefore, the equations of motion of this system in Cartesian
coordinates are:

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.39)
  -- -- -- --------

Immediately we recognize that this dynamical system is the well known
and important generalized Kepler Ermakov system (see [ 56 ] ).
A different representation of @xmath consists of the vectors

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For this representation from Table 4.8 we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

which leads again to the autonomous Kepler Ermakov system . In a
subsequent chapter, we shall apply the results obtained here to study
the integrability of the 3D Hamiltonian Kepler–Ermakov system and
generalize it in a Riemannian space.

In case the force is given by the potential @xmath , that is, that the
system is conservative, we obtain the results in Table 4.9 .

##### 4.5.2 3D autonomous Newtonian systems which admit Noether point
symmetries

In this section using theorem 4.3.2 we determine all autonomous
Newtonian Hamiltonian systems with Lagrangian

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

which admit a non-trivial Noether point symmetry. This problem has been
considered previously in [ 49 , 50 ] , however as we shall show the
results in these works are not complete. We note that the Lie symmetries
of a conservative system are not necessarily Noether symmetries. The
inverse is of course true.

Before we continue we note that the homothetic algebra of the Euclidian
3d space @xmath has dimension seven and consists of three gradient KVs
@xmath with gradient function @xmath , three non-gradient KVs @xmath
generating the rotational algebra @xmath and a gradient HV @xmath with
gradient function @xmath , where @xmath

The Noether point symmetries generated from the homothetic algebra i.e.
the non-gradient @xmath elements included, are shown in Table 4.10 .
Moreover, the Noether symmetries generated from the gradient homothetic
algebra are listed in Table 4.11 .

The corresponding Noether integrals are computed easily from proposition
4.3.3 . In Tables 4.18 , 4.19 and 4.20 (see Appendix 4.B ) we give a
complete list of the potentials resulting form the linear combinations
of the elements of the homothetic algebra. From the Tables we infer that
the isotropic linear forced oscillator admits 12 Noether point
symmetries, as many as the free particle.

As it has been remarked above, the determination of the Noether point
symmetries admitted by an autonomous Newtonian Hamiltonian system has
been considered previously in [ 50 ] . Our results extend the results of
[ 50 ] and coincide with them if we set the constant @xmath For example
in page 12 case 1 and page 15 case 6 of [ 50 ] the terms @xmath and
@xmath are missing respectively. Furthermore the potential given in
page/line 12/1, 13/2, 13/3 of [ 50 ] admits Noether symmetries only when
@xmath and @xmath This is due to the fact that the vectors given in [ 50
] are KVs and in order to have @xmath they must be given by Case II of
theorem 4.3.2 above, that is, the KVs must be gradient. However the KVs
used are linear combinations of translations and rotations which are
non-gradient.

It is possible that there exist integrable Newtonian dynamical systems
for potentials not included in these Tables, for example systems which
admit only dynamical symmetries [ 57 , 58 ] with integrals quadratic in
momenta [ 59 ] . However these systems are not integrable via Noether
point symmetries.

We remark that from the above results we are also able to give, without
any further calculations, the Lie and the Noether point symmetries of a
dynamical system ’moving’ in a three dimensional flat space whose metric
has Lorentzian signature simply by taking one of the coordinates to be
complex, for example by setting @xmath

#### 4.6 Motion on the two dimensional sphere

A first application of the results of section 4.5.2 is the determination
of Lie and Noether point symmetries admitted by the equations of motion
of a Newtonian particle moving in a two dimensional space of constant
non-vanishing curvature.

Before we continue it is useful to recall some facts concerning spaces
of constant curvature. Consider a @xmath dimensional flat space with
fundamental form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath are real constants. The hypersurfaces defined by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is an arbitrary constant and @xmath are called fundamental
hyperquadrics of the space. When all coefficients @xmath are positive
the space is Euclidian and @xmath . In this case there is one family of
hyperquadrics which is the hyperspheres. In all other cases (excluding
the case when all @xmath ’s are negative) there are two families of
hyperquadrics corresponding to the values @xmath and @xmath It has been
shown that in all cases the hyperquadrics are spaces of constant
curvature (see [ 60 ] p202).

Consider an autonomous dynamical system moving in the two dimensional
sphere (Euclidian @xmath or Hyperbolic @xmath ) with Lagrangian ⁵ ⁵ 5 We
use spherical coordinates which are natural in the case of spaces of
constant curvature. [ 61 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The equations of motion are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.43)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.44)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

For the Lagrangian ( 4.42 ) proposition 4.3.4 applies and we use it to
find the potentials @xmath for which additional Noether point
symmetries, hence Noether integrals are admitted.

The homothetic algebra of a metric of spaces of constant curvature
consists only of non-gradient KVs (hence @xmath as follows

(a) @xmath (Euclidian case)

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

(b) @xmath (Hyperbolic case)

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore the Noether vectors and the Noether function are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

provided the potential satisfies the condition

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

The first integrals given by proposition 4.3.3 are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

and are time dependent if @xmath .

##### 4.6.1 Noether Symmetries

We consider two cases, the case @xmath constant which concerns the
geodesics of the space, and the case @xmath constant.

For the case of geodesics it has been shown (see section 3.5 ) that the
Noether point symmetries are the three elements of @xmath with
corresponding Noether integrals

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.50)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.51)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.52)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

These integrals are in involution with the Hamiltonian hence the system
is Liouville integrable.

In the case @xmath constant we find the results of Table 4.12

The first integrals which correspond to each potential of Table 4.12 are
in involution with the Hamiltonian and independent. Hence the
corresponding systems are integrable. From Table 4.12 we infer the
following result.

###### Proposition 4.6.1

A dynamical system with Lagrangian ( 4.42 ) has one, two or four Noether
point symmetries hence Noether integrals.

Proof. For the case of the free particle we have the maximum number of
four Noether symmetries (the rotation group @xmath plus the @xmath ). In
the case the potential is not constant the Noether symmetries are
produced by the non-gradient KVs with Lie algebra

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath for @xmath and @xmath for @xmath Because the Noether point
symmetries form a Lie algebra and the Lie algebra of the KVs is
semisimple the system will admit either none, one or three Noether point
symmetries generated by the KVs. The case of three is when @xmath that
is the case of geodesics, therefore the Noether point symmetries will be
(including @xmath ) either one, two or four.

We note that the two important potentials of Celestial Mechanics, that
is @xmath which according to Bertrand ’s Theorem [ 61 , 62 , 63 ]
produce closed orbits on the sphere are included in Table 4.12 . Hence
the dynamical systems they define are Liouville integrable via Noether
point symmetries @xmath .  The potential @xmath corresponds to the
Newtonian Kepler potential and @xmath is the analogue of the harmonic
oscillator. We also note that our results contain those of [ 61 , 64 ]

We emphasize that the potentials listed in Table 4.12 concern dynamical
systems with Lagrangian ( 4.42 ) which are integrable via Noether point
symmetries.

#### 4.7 Applications

In this section we demonstrate the application of the results of section
4.4 in two cases. The first case is the Kepler-Ermakov system, which (in
general) is not a conservative dynamical system and the second is the
Hènon - Heiles type potential.

##### 4.7.1 Lie point symmetries of the Kepler-Ermakov system.

The Ermakov systems are time dependent dynamical systems, which contain
an arbitrary function of time (the frequency function) and two arbitrary
homogeneous functions of dynamical variables. A central feature of
Ermakov systems is their property of always having a first integral. The
Kepler-Ermakov system is an autonomous Ermakov system defined by the
equations [ 65 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.53)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.54)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are arbitrary functions. In [ 51 ] it has been shown that
this system admits Lie point symmetries for certain forms of the
function @xmath Furthermore it has been shown that for special classes
of these equations there exists a Lagrangian (see also [ 52 ] ).

In the following we demonstrate the use of our results by finding the
Lie point symmetries simply by reading the entries of the proper Tables.
Looking at the Tables we find that equations ( 4.53 ), ( 4.54 ) admit a
Lie point symmetry for the following two cases.

Case 1. When @xmath Then from Tables 4.2 and 4.3 @xmath we have that the
Lie point symmetries are

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.55)
  -- -- -- --------

Case 2. When @xmath where @xmath and @xmath . In this case Table 4.3 for
@xmath applies and the Lie point symmetry generator is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

These symmetries coincide with the ones found in [ 51 ] . We note that
in both cases the Lie symmetry vectors come from the HV @xmath of the
Euclidean metric.

In a subsequent publication [ 52 ] it was shown that the Lagrangian
considered in [ 51 ] was incorrect and that the correct Lagrangian is:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and the functions @xmath satisfy two compatibility
conditions (see equation (5.2) of [ 52 ] ).

We observe that the Lie symmetries are also Noether symmetries and that
the Noether Integrals (in addition to the Hamiltonian @xmath )
corresponding the these Noether symmetries are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.57)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.58)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

for @xmath . When @xmath the Noether integrals are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.59)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.60)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

In total we have three Noether integrals. Since we do not look for
generalized symmetries, we do not expect to find the Ermakov - Lewis
invariant [ 53 ] .

##### 4.7.2 Point symmetries of the Hènon - Heiles potential

The Hènon - Heiles potential

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

has been used as a model for the galactic cluster. Computer analysis has
suggested that for sufficiently small values of the energy, there exists
a first integral independent of energy. In [ 54 ] it is proposed to
study if there exists a Lie point symmetry of the potential which could
justify such a first integral. Working in a slightly more general
scenario, in [ 54 ] considered potentials of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are real parameters. The Hènon - Heiles potential is the
special case for @xmath .

Using standard Lie analysis in [ 54 ] it is shown that only the
potentials @xmath @xmath @xmath @xmath admit Lie point symmetries, hence
the Hènon - Heiles potential does not admit a Lie point symmetry and the
existence of a first integral it is not justified. We apply the results
of sections 4.4 , 4.4.1 to give the Lie point symmetries and the Noether
quantities of these potentials, simply by reading the relevant Tables.

The potential @xmath is of the form @xmath . Hence from Table 4.4
the  Lie point symmetries admitted by this potential are:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We note that the Lie symmetry @xmath which is due to the Affine
collineation, has not been found in [ 54 ] .

The potential @xmath is obtained by @xmath with @xmath interchanged.
Therefore the Lie point symmetries admitted by the potential @xmath are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and again in [ 54 ] the Lie point symmetry @xmath is missing.

The potential @xmath is of the form @xmath . Hence from Tables 4.16 and
4.17 the admitted Lie symmetries are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The potential @xmath is of the same form as @xmath with @xmath
interchanged. Therefore the Lie point symmetries are:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We observe that in all four cases the Lie point symmetries depend on
four free parameters (the @xmath The parameter @xmath determines the
vector @xmath and the rest @xmath the @xmath part of the symmetry
generators.

The Lie point symmetries which are possibly Noether symmetries are the
ones generated by the KVs. We check that the Lie point symmetries which
are due to the gradient KVs are Noether Symmetries of the potentials
(plus the @xmath whose Noether integral is the Hamiltonian). The Noether
integrals and the Noether functions corresponding to each of these
symmetries are given in Table 4.13 . The results coincide with those of
[ 54 , 55 ] .

#### 4.8 Conclusion

We have shown in Theorem 4.2.2 and Theorem 4.3.2 that the Lie and the
Noether point symmetries for the general class of equations of motion (
4.1 ) are generated from the special projective Lie algebra and the
homothetic Lie algebra respectively of the metric of the space where
motion takes place. The specific subalgebra is determined by a set of
differential conditions which involve the potential defining the
dynamical system. The results apply to both conservative and non
conservative dynamical systems. They also apply to affine spaces and
they are independent of the signature of the metric and the dimension of
the space.

The essence of the above is that they reduce the problem of finding the
Lie and the Noether point symmetries of second order systems of
equations of the form ( 4.1 ) to the geometric requirement of finding
the special projective algebra of the a metric (or more general of an
affine) space. Because there is a plethora of results in existing
studies on the projective algebra of Riemannian spaces, it is possible
that the problem of finding the Lie and the Noether point symmetries of
an autonomous conservative dynamical is already solved! As it has been
shown, one such case is the case of spaces of constant curvature. The
power of the geometric approach is that it gives all the Lie and the
Noether point symmetries without the use of computer programs.

An additional point, which could be of interest, is one to reverse the
argument and use the computational approach of the Lie symmetries of the
geodesic equations of a space to compute the projective group, which can
be a formidable task in Differential Geometry. Aminova [ 32 , 33 , 34 ]
has shown that if one chooses the Cartan parametrization of the geodesic
equations then the Lie symmetries generate the projective algebra of the
underline metric. Because up to now there do not seem to exist either a
general method or general theorems which allow the computation of the
projective algebra of a metric, this approach could be valuable.

We have applied these theorems to classify all two and three dimensional
Newtonian dynamical systems which admit at least one Lie symmetry, and
in the case of conservative forces, all two and three dimensional
potentials @xmath which admit a Lie symmetry and a Noether point
symmetry. These results complete previous results [ 48 , 49 , 50 ]
concerning the Noether point symmetries of the two and three dimensional
Newtonian dynamical systems. We note that, due to the geometric
derivation and the tabular presentation, the results can be extended
easily to higher dimensional flat spaces; however at the cost of
convenience because the linear combinations of the symmetry vectors
increase dramatically.

We have demonstrated the application of the results in various important
cases. We considered the Kepler-Ermakov system, which is an autonomous,
but in general not conservative dynamical system and we determined the
classes of this type of systems which admit Lie and Noether point
symmetries; we also considered the case of the Hènon Heiles type
potentials and determined their Lie point symmetries and their Noether
symmetries. These results are compatible and complete previous results
in the literature.

In the following chapter, we apply the results obtained here to study
the Liouville integrability of the three dimensional Hamiltonian
Kepler-Ermakov system and generalize it in a Riemannian space.

### Appendix 4.A Proof of main Theorem

Below, we give the proof of Theorem 4.2.2 .

Equation ( 4.6 ) gives:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.62)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a gradient KV. Replacing this in ( 4.5 ) we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.63)
  -- -------- -- --------

Because @xmath is a function of @xmath only and @xmath we must have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

hence ( 4.63 ) becomes:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.65)
  -- -------- -- --------

from which follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath , when @xmath is a KV,HKV,AC and @xmath if @xmath is a
special PC @xmath

The remaining equations ( 4.3 )-( 4.4 ) are written ( @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.68)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.69)
  -- -------- -- --------

Equation ( 4.69 ) is written as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which due to ( 4.66 ) is simplified as follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.70)
  -- -------- -- --------

Collecting the results we have the system of equations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.71)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.72)

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.73)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.74)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath , when @xmath is a KV,HKV,AC and @xmath if @xmath is a sp.
PC @xmath We consider various cases.

Case I. @xmath In this case ( 4.71 ) implies @xmath and ( 4.73 ),( 4.74
) give

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.75)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.76)
  -- -------- -- --------

From ( 4.75 ) follows @xmath and consequently ( 4.76 ) implies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.77)
  -- -------- -- --------

Because @xmath it follows that @xmath Therefore in this case we have the
Lie Symmetry

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.78)
  -- -------- -- --------

Case II. @xmath .  Equation ( 4.71 ) implies @xmath . Then ( 4.73 ),(
4.74 ) give:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.79)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.80)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

It follows @xmath where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.81)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then ( 4.80 ) is written

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.82)
  -- -------- -- --------

from which we infer that @xmath This means @xmath hence @xmath can only
be KV, HV or AC and furthermore @xmath We conclude that provided the
potential satisfies the condition

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.83)
  -- -------- -- --------

the symmetry vector is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.84)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a KV, HV or AC.

Case III. @xmath . In this case we have the system of simultaneous
equations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.85)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.86)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.87)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Suppose that @xmath is a non-gradient KV or non-gradient HV or AC. Then
@xmath constant so that @xmath Then ( 4.87 ) becomes:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.88)
  -- -------- -- --------

and follows (by taking the antisymmetric part in the indices @xmath that
@xmath contrary to our assumption. Therefore @xmath must be a gradient
KV, gradient HV or sp.PC @xmath We consider various subcases.

Case III. a. @xmath is a gradient KV/HKV and @xmath Then we have @xmath
constant and equations ( 4.86 ),( 4.87 ) are written as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.89)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.90)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

From ( 4.89 ) we infer

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.91)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.92)
  -- -------- -- --------

From ( 4.90 ) we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.93)
  -- -------- -- --------

that is:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.94)
  -- -------- -- --------

The last relation is satisfied only for @xmath .  Then ( 4.91 ),( 4.93 )
give:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.95)
  -- -------- -- --------

We conclude that provided the potential satisfies equation ( 4.92 ) and
@xmath where @xmath for a KV and @xmath for a HV, we have the Lie
symmetry vector

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.96)
  -- -------- -- --------

Case III. b. @xmath is a gradient HV and @xmath In this case we have
@xmath constant and the system of equations ( 4.86 ),( 4.87 ) becomes:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.97)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.98)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

From ( 4.98 ) follows @xmath which implies the equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.99)
  -- -------- -- --------

Because @xmath the @xmath and we have the second condition

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.100)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We conclude that in this case the Lie symmetry vector is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.101)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the functions @xmath @xmath are solutions of the system of
equations ( 4.98 ) and ( 4.98 ).

Case III. c. @xmath is a special PC. In this case the system of symmetry
conditions reads

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.102)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.103)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.104)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

Using ( 4.102 ) we write ( 4.103 ) as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.105)
  -- -------- -- ---------

from which follows

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.106)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.107)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Then relation ( 4.104 ) implies the conditions

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.108)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.109)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We conclude that in this case provided the potential function satisfies
( 4.107 ), we have the Lie symmetry vector

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.110)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the functions @xmath are computed form the equations ( 4.102 ), (
4.106 ), ( 4.108 ).

Case III. d. @xmath is a special PC of the form @xmath constant. and
@xmath is a gradient KV of the metric.

This case is possible only when the potential is such that the vector
@xmath is the gradient HV of the metric (if the metric admits one). Then
it is easy to show that due to ( 4.85 ) equation ( 4.86 ) becomes:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We compute

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.111)
  -- -------- -- ---------

therefore

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.112)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It follows

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.113)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.114)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

and the condition

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.115)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Condition ( 4.87 ) now reads

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

from which follows @xmath that is,

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

We conclude that in this case we have the Lie symmetry vector

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the functions @xmath are computed form the solution of the system
of simultaneous equations

### Appendix 4.B Tables of Newtonian systems admit Lie and Noether
symmetries

### Chapter 5 The autonomous Kepler Ermakov system in a Riemannian space

#### 5.1 Introduction

The Ermakov system has its roots in the study of the one dimensional
time dependent harmonic oscillator

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

Ermakov [ 66 ] obtained a first integral @xmath of this equation by
introducing the auxiliary equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

eliminating the @xmath term and multiplying with the integrating factor
@xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

The Ermakov system was rediscovered nearly a century after its
introduction [ 67 ] and subsequently was generalized beyond the harmonic
oscillator to a two dimensional dynamical system which admits a first
integral [ 68 ] . In a series of papers the Lie, the Noether and the
dynamical symmetries of this generalized system have been studied. A
short review of these studies  and a detailed list of relevant
references can be found in [ 69 ] . Earlier reviews of the Ermakov
system and its numerous applications in divertive areas of Physics can
be found in [ 70 , 71 ] .

The general Ermakov system does not admit Lie point symmetries. The form
of the most general Ermakov system which admits Lie point symmetries has
been determined in [ 72 ] and it is called the Kepler Ermakov system [
65 , 56 ] . It is well known that these Lie point symmetries are a
representation of the @xmath algebra.

In an attempt to generalize the Kepler Ermakov system to higher
dimensions, Leach [ 56 ] used a transformation to remove the time
dependent frequency term and then demanded that the autonomous
‘generalized’ Kepler Ermakov system will posses two properties: (a) a
first integral, the Ermakov invariant and (b) @xmath invariance wrt to
Lie symmetries. It has been shown, that the invariance group of the
Ermakov invariant is reacher than @xmath [ 73 ] . The purpose of the
present work is to use Leach’s proposal and generalize the autonomous
Kepler Ermakov system in two directions: (a) to higher dimensions using
the @xmath invariance with respect to Noether symmetries (provided the
system is Hamiltonian) and (b) in a Riemannian space which admits a
gradient homothetic vector (HV).

The generalization of the autonomous Kepler Ermakov system to three
dimensions using Lie symmetries has been done in [ 56 ] . In the
following sections, we use the results of Chapter 4 to generalize the
subset of autonomous Hamiltonian Kepler Ermakov systems to three
dimensions via Noether symmetries. We show, that there is a family of
three dimensional autonomous Hamiltonian Kepler Ermakov systems
parametrized by an arbitrary function @xmath which admits the elements
of @xmath as Noether point symmetries. Each member of this family admits
two first integrals, the Hamiltonian and the Ermakov invariant.

We use this result in order to determine all three dimensional
Hamiltonian Kepler Ermakov systems which are Liouville integrable via
Noether point symmetries. To do this we need to determine all members of
the family, that is, those functions @xmath for which the corresponding
system admits an additional Noether symmetry.

The results of Chapter 4 indicate that there are two cases to be
considered, i.e. Noether point symmetries resulting from linear
combinations of (a) translations and (b) rotations (elements of the
@xmath algebra). In each case we determine the functions @xmath and the
required extra time independent first integral.

The above scenario can be generalized to an @xmath dimensional Euclidian
space as Leach indicates in [ 56 ] , however at the cost of major
complexity and number of cases to be considered. Indeed as it can be
seen by the results of Chapter 4 , the situation is complex enough even
for the three dimensional case.

We continue with the generalization of the Kepler Ermakov system in a
different and more drastic direction. We note that the Ermakov systems
considered so far are based on the Euclidian space, therefore we may
call them Euclidian Ermakov systems. Furthermore the @xmath symmetry
algebra of the autonomous Kepler Ermakov system is generated by the
trivial symmetry @xmath and the gradient HV of the Euclidian two
dimensional space @xmath Using this observation we generalize the
autonomous Kepler Ermakov system (not necessarily Hamiltonian) in an
@xmath dimensional Riemannian space which admits a gradient HV using
either Lie or Noether point symmetries. The new dynamical system we call
the Riemannian Kepler Ermakov system. This generalization makes possible
the application of the autonomous Kepler Ermakov system in General
Relativity and in particular in Cosmology.

Concerning General Relativity, we determine the four dimensional
autonomous Riemannian Kepler Ermakov system and the associated
Riemannian Ermakov invariant in the spatially flat Freedman - Robertson
- Walker (FRW) spacetime and we use previous results to calculate the
extra Noether point symmetries. The applications to cosmology concern
two models for dark energy on a locally rotational symmetric (LRS) space
time. The first model involves a scalar field with an exponential
potential minimally interacting with a perfect fluid with a stiff
equation of state. The second cosmological model is the @xmath modified
gravity model of @xmath . It is shown, that, in both models the
gravitational field equations define an autonomous Riemannian Kepler
Ermakov system which is integrable via Noether integrals.

In section 5.2 , we review the main features of the two dimensional
autonomous Euclidian Kepler Ermakov system. In section 5.3 , we discuss
the general scheme of generalization of the two dimensional autonomous
Euclidian Kepler Ermakov system to higher dimensions and to a Riemannian
space which admits a gradient HV. In section 5.4 , we consider the
generalization to the 3D autonomous Euclidian Hamiltonian Kepler Ermakov
system by Noether point symmetries and determine all such systems which
are Liouville integrable. In section 5.6 , we define the autonomous
Riemannian Kepler Ermakov system by the requirements that it will admit
(a) a first integral (the Ermakov invariant) and (b) posses @xmath
invariance. In section 5.6.1 , we consider the non-conservative
autonomous Riemannian Kepler Ermakov system and derive the Riemannian
Ermakov invariant and in section 5.6.2 we repeat the same for the
autonomous Hamiltonian Riemannian Kepler Ermakov system. In the
remaining sections we discuss the applications of the autonomous
Hamiltonian Riemannian Kepler Ermakov system in General Relativity and
in Cosmology.

#### 5.2 The two dimensional autonomous Kepler Ermakov system

In [ 72 ] Hass and Goedert considered the most general 2d Newtonian
Ermakov system to be defined by the equations:

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.4)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.5)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

This system admits the Ermakov first integral

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

If one considers the transformation:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

then equations ( 5.4 )-( 5.5 ) take the form

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.7)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.8)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Due to the second equation, except for special cases, the new function
@xmath is independent of @xmath ; it depends only on the dynamical
variables @xmath and possibly on their derivative. The Ermakov first
integral in the new variables is:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

The system of equations ( 5.7 )-( 5.8 ) defines the most general 2D
Ermakov system and produces all its known forms for special choices of
the function @xmath For example, the weak Kepler Ermakov system [ 56 ]
is defined by the equations [ 65 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.10)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.11)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are arbitrary functions of their argument, @xmath is of the
form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the Ermakov first integral becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

The weak Kepler Ermakov system does not admit Lie point symmetries.
However, the property of having a first integral prevails. The system of
equations ( 5.10 ), ( 5.11 ) admits the @xmath as Lie point symmetries [
52 ] only for @xmath where @xmath is either a real or a pure imaginary
number.  This is the Kepler Ermakov system defined by the equations

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.14)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.15)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

It is well known (see [ 52 ] ) that the oscillator term @xmath in ( 5.14
)-( 5.15 ) is removed if one considers new variables @xmath defined by
the relations:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is any smooth solution of the time dependent oscillator
equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

In [ 52 ] it is commented that ”the effect of @xmath is to shift the
time dependent frequency function”. However this is true as long as
@xmath When @xmath one has the autonomous Kepler Ermakov system whose
Lie symmetries span the @xmath algebra with different representations
for @xmath and @xmath

Before we justify the need for the consideration of the two cases @xmath
and @xmath , we note that by applying the transformation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath satisfies the Ermakov Pinney equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

to the transformed equations

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.20)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.21)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

we retain the term @xmath and obtain the autonomous Kepler Ermakov
system of [ 53 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.22)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.23)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The above transformations show that the consideration of the autonomous
Kepler Ermakov system is not a real restriction.

We discuss now the need for the consideration of the cases @xmath and
@xmath In Section 4.7 , we have determined the Lie symmetries of the
autonomous 2d Kepler Ermakov system and we have found two cases. Case I
concerns the autonomous Kepler Ermakov system with @xmath and has the
Lie symmetry vectors

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

The second case, Case II, concerns the same system with @xmath and has
the Lie symmetry vectors

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

where in both cases @xmath is the gradient HV of the 2D Euclidian
metric. Each set of vectors in ( 5.25 )-( 5.24 ) is a representation of
the @xmath algebra and furthermore each set of vectors is constructed
from the vector @xmath and the gradient HV @xmath of the Euclidian two
dimensional space @xmath .

The essence of the difference between the two representations is best
seen in the corresponding first integrals. If a Kepler Ermakov system is
Hamiltonian then the Lie point symmetries are also Noether point
symmetries therefore in order to find these integrals we determine the
Noether invariants. The Noether symmetries of the Kepler Ermakov system
have been determined in Section 4.7 . For the convenience of the reader
we repeat the relevant material.

Equations ( 5.22 ), ( 5.23 ) follow from the Lagrangian [ 52 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath provided the functions @xmath satisfy the constraint:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Ermakov invariant in this case is [ 52 ] .

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

Because the system is autonomous the first Noether integral is the
Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

In addition to the Hamiltonian, there exist two additional time
dependent Noether integrals as follows:
@xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.30)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.31)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

@xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.32)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.33)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

We note that the Noether integrals corresponding to the representation (
5.24 ) are linear in @xmath whereas the ones corresponding to the
representation ( 5.25 ) are exponential. Therefore the consideration of
the cases @xmath and @xmath is not spurious otherwise we loose important
information. This latter fact is best seen in the applications of
Noether symmetries to field theories where the main core of the theory
is the Lagrangian. In these cases the potential is given and, as it has
been shown in Chapter 4 , a given potential admits certain Noether
symmetries only; therefore one has to consider all possible cases. We
shall come to this situation in section 5.8 where it will be found that
the potential selects the representation ( 5.25 ).

To complete this section, we mention that for a Hamiltonian Kepler
Ermakov system the Ermakov invariant ( 5.28 ) is constructed [ 53 ] from
the Hamiltonian and the Noether invariants ( 5.32 ),( 5.33 ) as follows:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Finally in [ 53 ] , it is shown that the Ermakov invariant is generated
by a dynamical Noether symmetry of the Lagrangian ( 5.26 ), a result
which is also confirmed in [ 74 ] .

#### 5.3 Generalizing the autonomous Kepler Ermakov system

We consider the generalization of the two dimensional autonomous Kepler
Ermakov system [ 56 , 72 , 75 , 76 , 77 , 78 ] using a geometric point
of view. From the results presented so far we have the following:

(i) Equations ( 5.4 )-( 5.5 ) which define the Ermakov system employ
coordinates in the Euclidian two dimensional space, therefore the system
is the Euclidian Ermakov system.

(ii) The autonomous 2D Euclidian Kepler Ermakov system is defined by
equations ( 5.22 ) and ( 5.23 )

(iii) The Lie symmetries of the Kepler Ermakov system span the @xmath
algebra. These symmetries are constructed from the vector @xmath and the
gradient HV of the space @xmath .

(iv) For the autonomous Hamiltonian Kepler Ermakov system the Lie
symmetries reduce to Noether point symmetries and the Ermakov invariant
follows from a combination of the resulting three Noether integrals, two
of which are time dependent. Furthermore, the Ermakov invariant is the
Noether integral of a dynamical Noether symmetry.

The above observations imply that we may generalize the Kepler Ermakov
system in two directions:

a. Increase the number of dimensions by defining the @xmath dimensional
Euclidian Kepler Ermakov system and/or

b. Generalize the background Euclidian space to be a Riemannian space
and obtain the Riemannian Kepler Ermakov system.

Concerning the defining characteristics of the Kepler Ermakov system we
distinguish three different properties of reduced generality: The
property of having a first integral; the property of admitting
Lie/Noether point symmetries, the @xmath invariance and the property of
being Hamiltonian and admitting @xmath invariance via Noether point
symmetries.

Following Leach [ 56 ] we generalize the autonomous Kepler Ermakov
system to higher dimensions by the requirement: The generalized
autonomous (Euclidian) Kepler Ermakov system admits the @xmath algebra
as a Lie symmetry algebra.

#### 5.4 The three dimensional autonomous Euclidian Kepler Ermakov
system

The generalization of the autonomous Euclidian Kepler Ermakov system
using @xmath invariance of Lie symmetries has been done in [ 56 , 77 ,
78 ] . In this section, using of the results of Chapter 4 , we give the
generalization of the autonomous Euclidian Hamiltonian Kepler Ermakov
system to three dimensions by demanding @xmath invariance with respect
to Noether point symmetries. The reason for attempting this
generalization is that it leads to the potentials for which the
corresponding extended systems are Liouville integrable. Furthermore
indicates the path to the @xmath dimensional Riemannian Kepler Ermakov
system.

Depending on the value @xmath or @xmath we consider the three
dimensional Hamiltonian Kepler Ermakov systems of type I and type II.

##### 5.4.1 The 3D autonomous Hamiltonian Kepler Ermakov system of type
I @xmath

For @xmath the admitted Noether symmetries are required to be (see (
5.25 ))

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

From Table 4.11 and @xmath of section 4.5.2 , we find that for these
vectors the potential is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

hence, the Lagrangian is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

The equations of motion, that is, the equations defining the generalized
dynamical system are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.36)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.37)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.38)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The Noether integrals corresponding to the Noether vectors are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath               (5.39)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.40)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.41)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the Hamiltonian. The Noether integrals @xmath are time
dependent. Following [ 53 ] we define the time independent combined
first integral

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using ( 5.42 ) the equation of motion ( 5.36 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is the autonomous Ermakov- Pinney equation [ 79 ] . Therefore
@xmath is the Ermakov invariant [ 56 ] .

An alternative way to construct the Ermakov invariant ( 5.42 ) is to use
dynamical Noether symmetries [ 58 ] . Indeed one can show that the
Lagrangian ( 5.35 ) admits the dynamical Noether symmetry @xmath where
@xmath is a Killing tensor of the second rank whose non-vanishing
components are @xmath The dynamical Noether symmetry vector is @xmath
with gauge function @xmath .

##### 5.4.2 The 3D autonomous Hamiltonian Kepler Ermakov system of type
II @xmath

For @xmath the Noether point symmetries are required to be (see ( 5.24
)) [ 56 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

From Table 4.10 and from Table 4.11 for @xmath of section 4.5.2 , we
find that the potential is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

hence, the Lagrangian is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

The equations of motion are ( 5.36 ) - ( 5.38 ) with @xmath . The
Noether invariants of the Lagrangian ( 5.45 ) are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.46)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.47)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.48)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

We note that the time dependent first integrals @xmath are linear in
@xmath whereas the corresponding integrals @xmath of the case @xmath are
exponential. From @xmath we define the time independent first integral
@xmath which is calculated to be

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using ( 5.49 ) the equation of motion for @xmath becomes @xmath which is
the one dimensional Ermakov-Pinney equation, hence @xmath is the Ermakov
invariant [ 56 ] . As it was the case with the three dimensional
Hamiltonian Kepler Ermakov system of type I, the Lagrangian ( 5.45 )
admits the dynamical Noether symmetry @xmath whose integral is the (
5.49 ).

#### 5.5 Integrability of 3D autonomous Euclidian Kepler Ermakov system

The 3d autonomous Hamiltonian Euclidian Kepler Ermakov systems need
three independent first integrals in involution in order to be Liouville
integrable. As we have shown each system has the two Noether integrals
@xmath , therefore, we need one more Noether symmetry. Such a symmetry
exists only for special forms of the arbitrary function @xmath . From
tables 4.10 , 4.11 , 4.18 , 4.19 and 4.20 of Chapter 4 we find that
extra Noether symmetries are possible only ¹ ¹ 1 The linear combination
of an element of @xmath with a translation does not give a potential,
hence, an additional Noether symmetry. for linear combinations of
translations (i.e. vectors of the form @xmath where @xmath are
constants) and/or rotations (i.e. elements of @xmath .

##### 5.5.1 Noether symmetries generated from the translation group

We determine the functions @xmath for which the 3D autonomous
Hamiltonian Euclidian Kepler Ermakov system admits extra Noether point
symmetries for linear combinations of the translation group.

The Lagrangian ( 5.35 )

In Cartesian coordinates the Lagrangian ( 5.35 ) is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath From Table 4.20 with @xmath we find that the Lagrangian (
5.50 ) admits Noether symmetries, which are produced from a linear
combination of translations, @xmath if the function @xmath has the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this case, the Lagrangian ( 5.50 ) admits at least the following two
extra Noether symmetries

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

with corresponding Noether integrals

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

We note that the first integrals @xmath are time dependent; however the
first integral

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

is time independent. As it was the case with the Ermakov invariant (
5.42 ) the integral @xmath is possible to be constructed directly from
the dynamical Noether symmetry @xmath , where @xmath is a Killing tensor
of the second rank [ 58 , 59 ] , with non-vanishing components

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

so that the dynamical symmetry vector is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Ermakov invariant @xmath (see ( 5.42 ) ) in Cartesian coordinates is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

The first integrals @xmath are not in involution. Using the Poisson
brackets we construct new first integrals and at some stage one of them
will be in involution. These new first integrals can also be constructed
form corresponding dynamical Noether symmetries.

An example of a known Lagrangian of the form ( 5.50 ) is the three body
Calogero-Moser Lagrangian [ 80 , 81 , 82 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

The extra Noether symmetries of this Lagrangian are produced by the
vector ( 5.52 ) @xmath for @xmath

The Lagrangian ( 5.45 )

In Cartesian coordinates the Lagrangian ( 5.45 ) is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

According to Tables 4.19 and 4.20 (with @xmath ), the Lagrangian ( 5.58
) admits extra Noether point symmetries for a linear combination of
translations if the function @xmath is of the form ( 5.51 ). In this
case the corresponding Noether integrals are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

Example of such a Lagrangian is the Calogero-Moser Lagrangian [ 80 ]
(without the oscillator term)

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

For the Lagrangian ( 5.60 ), we have the first integrals @xmath . From
the integrals @xmath we construct the integral @xmath . It is easy to
show that the integrals @xmath are in involution hence the dynamical
system is Liouville integrable. We remark, that, the first integrals
@xmath can also be computed by making use of the Lax pair tensor [ 82 ]
.

##### 5.5.2 Noether symmetries generated from @xmath

The elements of @xmath in spherical coordinates are the three vectors
@xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

which are also KVs for the Euclidian sphere.

In this case, the symmetry condition becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.62)
  -- -------- -- --------

or, equivalently

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.63)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the metric of the Euclidian sphere, that is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

We infer that the problem of determining the extra Noether point
symmetries of Lagrangian ( 5.35 ) generated from elements of the @xmath
is equivalent to the determination of the Noether point symmetries for
motion on the 2D sphere.

It is easy to show, that, the integrals of Table 4.12 of section 4.6 are
in involution with the Hamiltonian and the Ermakov invariant, therefore,
the system is Liouville integrable via Noether point symmetries.

The above results are extended to the case in which the system moves on
the hyperbolic sphere that is, it has Lagrangian

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.65)
  -- -------- -- --------

We reach at the following conclusion.

###### Proposition 5.5.1

The three dimensional autonomous Hamiltonian Kepler Ermakov system with
Lagrangian ( 5.35 ) is Liouville Integrable via Noether point
symmetries, which are generated from a linear combination of the three
elements of the @xmath algebra, if and only if the equivalent dynamical
system in the fundamental hyperquadrics of the three dimensional flat
space is integrable.

We note that it is possible a three dimensional autonomous Kepler
Ermakov system to admit more Noether symmetries which are due to the
rotation group and the translation group (but not to a linear
combination of elements from the two groups). For example, the 3D Kepler
Ermakov system with Lagrangian [ 50 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

has the following extra Noether point symmetries (in addition to the
elements of @xmath )

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The vectors @xmath and @xmath follow from ( 5.52 ) for @xmath and @xmath
respectively, whereas @xmath is a linear combination of the three
elements of @xmath . The  Noether integrals of the Noether symmetries
@xmath are respectively

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.67)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.68)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.69)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.70)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.71)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

It is clear that in order to extend the Kepler Ermakov system to higher
dimensions one needs to have the type of results of Chapter 4 ;
therefore, the remark made in [ 56 ] , that the ‘notion is easily
generalized to higher dimensions’ has to be understood as referring to
the general scenario and not to the actual work.

#### 5.6 The autonomous Riemannian Kepler Ermakov system

As it has been noted in section 5.2 , the Kepler Ermakov systems
considered so far in the literature are Newtonian Kepler Ermakov
systems. In this section we make a drastic step forward and introduce
the autonomous Riemannian Kepler Ermakov systems of dimension @xmath The
generalization we consider is based on the following definition

###### Definition 5.6.1

The @xmath dimensional autonomous Riemannian Kepler Ermakov system is an
autonomous dynamical system which:
a. It is defined on a Riemannian space which admits a gradient HV
b. Admits a first integral, which we name the Riemannian Ermakov first
integral and it is characterized by the requirement that the
corresponding equation of motion takes the form of the Ermakov Pinney
equation.
c. It is invariant at least under the @xmath algebra, which is generated
by the vector @xmath and the gradient HV of the space.

There are two types of @xmath dimensional autonomous Riemannian Kepler
Ermakov systems. The ones which are not Hamiltonian and admit the @xmath
algebra as Lie point symmetries and the ones which are conservative and
admit the @xmath algebra as Noether point symmetries.

##### 5.6.1 The non Hamiltonian autonomous Riemannian Kepler Ermakov
system

Consider an @xmath dimensional Riemannian space which admits a gradient
HV. It is well known, that the metric of this space can always be
written in the form [ 83 , 84 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.72)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the Latin capital indices @xmath take the values @xmath and @xmath
is the generic @xmath metric. The gradient HV of the metric is the
vector @xmath ( @xmath ) @xmath generated from the function @xmath . We
note the relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.73)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are the connection coefficients of the @xmath metric @xmath
In that space, we consider a particle moving under the action of the
force

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The equations of motion @xmath when projected along the direction of
@xmath and in the @xmath space give the equations

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.74)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.75)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath is an affine parameter.

Because the system is autonomous admits the Lie point symmetry @xmath .
Using the vector @xmath and the gradient HV @xmath we construct two
representations of @xmath by means of the sets of vectors (see ( 5.34
) and ( 5.44 ))

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.76)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.77)
  -- -------- -- --------

and require that the vectors in each set will be Lie point symmetries of
the system of equations ( 5.74 ),( 5.75 ). In Appendix 5.A we show that
the requirement of the invariance of the force under both
representations ( 5.76 ), ( 5.77 ) of @xmath demands that the force be
of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.78)
  -- -------- -- --------

Replacing @xmath in the system of equations ( 5.74 ),( 5.75 ) we find

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.79)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.80)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Multiplying the second equation with @xmath and using ( 5.73 ) we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.81)
  -- -------- -- --------

from which follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.82)
  -- -------- -- --------

The rhs is a perfect differential if @xmath where @xmath is a
differentiable function. If this is the case we find the first integral

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.83)
  -- -------- -- --------

We note that @xmath involves the arbitrary metric @xmath and the
function @xmath ). Furthermore equations ( 5.79 ), ( 5.80 ) become

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.84)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.85)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

These are the equations defining the @xmath dimensional autonomous
Riemannian Kepler Ermakov system.

Using the first integral ( 5.83 ), the equation of motion ( 5.84 ) is
written as follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.86)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath This is the Ermakov-Pinney equation; hence, we identify (
5.83 ) as the Riemannian Ermakov integral of the autonomous Riemannian
Kepler Ermakov system.

##### 5.6.2 The autonomous conservative Riemannian Kepler Ermakov system

In the following we assume that the force is derived from the potential
@xmath that is, the dynamical system is conservative so that the
equations of motion follow from the Lagrangian

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.87)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Hamiltonian is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.88)
  -- -------- -- --------

The equations of motion, i.e. the Euler-Lagrange equations, are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.89)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.90)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The demand that Lagrangian ( 5.87 ) admits Noether point symmetries
which are generated from the gradient HV leads to the following cases.

Case A: The Lagrangian ( 5.87 ) admits the Noether point symmetries (
5.76 ) if the potential is of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.91)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Noether integrals of these Noether point symmetries are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.92)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.93)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.94)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the @xmath Hamiltonian.

Case B: The Lagrangian ( 5.87 ) admits the Noether point symmetries (
5.77 ) if the potential is of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.95)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Noether integrals of these Noether point symmetries are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.96)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.97)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.98)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the @xmath Hamiltonian.

Using the Noether integrals we construct the Riemannian Ermakov
invariant @xmath , which is common for both Case A and Case B, as
follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.99)
  -- -------- -- --------

This coincides with the invariant first integral defined in ( 5.83 ). We
note that with the use of the first integral ( 5.99 ) the Hamiltonians (
5.92 ) and ( 5.96 ) take the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.100)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which is the Hamiltonian for the Ermakov Pinney equation.

As it was the case with the Euclidian case of section 5.2 , it can be
shown that the Riemannian Ermakov invariant ( 5.99 ) is due to a
dynamical Noether symmetry [ 58 ] . We collect the results in the
following proposition.

###### Proposition 5.6.2

In a Riemannian space with metric @xmath which admits a gradient HV, the
equations of motion of a Hamiltonian system moving under the action of
the potential @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.101)
  -- -------- -- ---------

admit the @xmath invariance and also an invariant first integral, the
Riemannian Ermakov invariant. This latter quantity is also possible to
be identified as the Noether integral of a dynamical Noether symmetry.

Without going into details we state the following general result.

###### Proposition 5.6.3

Consider an @xmath dimensional Riemannian space with an @xmath
decomposable metric, which in the Cartesian coordinates @xmath has the
general form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.102)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a flat non degenerate metric (of arbitrary signature).
If there exists a potential, so that the vectors @xmath are Noether
point symmetries, where @xmath are constants, with Noether integrals
@xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.103)
  -- -------- -- ---------

the combined first integral @xmath is time independent and it is the
result of a dynamical Noether symmetry.

In the remaining sections we consider applications of the autonomous
Riemannian Kepler Ermakov system in General Relativity and in Cosmology.

#### 5.7 The autonomous Riemannian Kepler Ermakov system in General
Relativity

Below, we study the integrability of the Riemannian Kepler Ermakov
system via Noether point symmetries in a conformally flat spacetime
which admits a homothetic Lie algebra with a gradient (proper) HV.

##### 5.7.1 The Riemannian Kepler Ermakov system on a 4D FRW spacetime

Consider the spatially flat FRW spacetime with metric

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.104)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This metric admits the gradient HV @xmath and six non gradient KVs [ 45
, 44 ] which are the KVs of @xmath .

We consider the autonomous Riemannian Kepler Ermakov system defined by
the Lagrangian (see ( 5.101 ) ) ( @xmath )

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.105)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The Euler Lagrange equations are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.106)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.107)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath . The Lagrangian ( 5.105 ) has the form of the Lagrangian (
5.87 ) for the potential @xmath hence according to proposition 5.6.2
possesses @xmath invariance under Noether point symmetries for both
representations ( 5.76 ) and ( 5.77 ). The two time independent
invariants are the Hamiltonian and the Riemannian Ermakov invariant
(proposition 5.6.2 )

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.108)
     @xmath   @xmath               (5.109)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

Note that had we considered the representation ( 5.76 ) only (that is we
had set @xmath then we would have lost all information concerning the
system defined for @xmath We emphasize that in applications to Physics
the major datum is the Lagrangian and not the equations of motion,
therefore one should not make mathematical assumptions which restrict
the physical generality.

To assure Liouville integrability we need one more Noether symmetry
whose Noether integral is in involution with @xmath This is possible for
certain forms of the potential @xmath Using the general results of
section 4.5 where all 3D potentials are given which admit extra Noether
symmetries we find the results of Table 5.1 .

###### Proposition 5.7.1

The Lagrangian ( 5.105 ) admits an extra Noether symmetry if and only if
the potential @xmath has a form given in Table 5.1 ² ² 2 Where @xmath
and @xmath .

For example if @xmath then the system admits three extra Noether
symmetries which are the elements of @xmath . If @xmath then the system
admits six extra Noether symmetries (the KVs of the three dimensional
Euclidian space).

##### 5.7.2 The Riemannian Kepler Ermakov system on a 3D FRW spacetime

Consider the three dimensional Lorentzian metric

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.110)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which admits the gradient HV @xmath and the three KVs of the Euclidian
metric @xmath In that space consider the Lagrangian

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.111)
  -- -------- -- ---------

According to proposition 5.6.2 this Lagrangian admits as Noether point
symmetries the elements of @xmath Then from proposition 5.6.2 we have
that the Noether invariants of these symmetries are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.112)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.113)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

The requirement that the Lagrangian admits an additional Noether
symmetry leads to the condition @xmath therefore in that case we have a
2D potential and we can use the results of Chapter 4 . If we demand the
new Noether integral to be time independent @xmath then the potential
@xmath and the new Noether integrals are given in Table 5.2 .

Lagrangians with kinetic term @xmath appear in cosmological models. In
the following section we discuss such applications.

#### 5.8 The Riemannian Kepler Ermakov system in cosmology

Below, we consider two cosmological models for dark energy, a scalar
field cosmology and an @xmath cosmology in a locally rotational
symmetric (LRS) spacetime.

##### 5.8.1 The case of scalar field cosmology

Consider the Class A LRS spacetime

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.114)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which is assumed to contain a scalar field with exponential potential
@xmath and a perfect fluid with a stiff equation of state @xmath , where
@xmath is the pressure and @xmath is the energy density of the fluid.
The conservation equation for the matter density gives

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.115)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Einstein field equations for the comoving observers @xmath follow from
the autonomous Lagrangian [ 85 , 86 ]

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.116)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We set @xmath and the Lagrangian becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.117)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The Hamiltonian is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.118)
  -- -------- -- ---------

If we consider the transformation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.119)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.120)
  -- -------- -- ---------

the Lagrangian ( 5.117 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.121)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We consider a 2D Riemannian space with metric defined by the kinematic
terms of the Lagrangian, that is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.122)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We show easily that this metric admits the gradient HV @xmath with
gradient function @xmath Therefore the Lagrangian ( 5.117 ) defines an
autonomous Hamiltonian Riemannian Kepler Ermakov system with potential (
@xmath )

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.123)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Because @xmath this Lagrangian admits @xmath invariance only for the
representation ( 5.76 ) (an additional result which shows the necessity
for the consideration of the cases @xmath and @xmath

Using proposition 5.6.2 , we write the Ermakov invariant

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.124)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The second invariant is the Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.125)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We find that the Lagrangian admits three more Noether symmetries

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.126)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with corresponding integrals

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.127)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It is easy to show that three of the integrals are in involution,
therefore the system is Liouville integrable.

##### 5.8.2 The case of @xmath Cosmology

Consider the modified Einstein-Hilbert action

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.128)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a smooth function of the curvature scalar @xmath The
resulting field equations for this action in the metric variational
approach are [ 87 ]

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.129)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath and @xmath In the LRS spacetime ( 5.114 ), with @xmath
these equations for comoving observers are the Euler-Lagrange equations
of the Lagrangian

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.130)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The Hamiltonian is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.131)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Again we consider the 3d Riemannian space whose metric is defined by the
kinematic part of the Lagrangian ( 5.130 )

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.132)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This metric admits the gradient HV

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.133)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with gradient function @xmath

In order to determine the function @xmath we demand the geometric
condition that Lagrangian ( 5.130 ) admits @xmath invariance via Noether
symmetries. Then for each representation ( 5.76 ), ( 5.77 ) we have a
different function @xmath hence a different physical theory.

The representation ( 5.76 ) in the present context is:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.134)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The Noether conditions become

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.135)
  -- -------- -- ---------

These vectors are Noether symmetries if @xmath and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.136)
  -- -------- -- ---------

However power law @xmath theories are not cosmologically viable [ 88 ] .

The second representation ( 5.77 ) in the present context gives the
vectors

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.137)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The Noether conditions give

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.138)
  -- -------- -- ---------

These vectors are Noether symmetries if the constant @xmath and  the
function

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.139)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath This model is the viable @xmath CDM-like cosmological with
@xmath . [ 89 ] .

We note that if we had not considered the latter representation then we
would loose this interesting result. The importance of the result is due
to the fact that it follows from a geometric assumption which is beyond
and above the physical considerations. Furthermore the assumption of
Noether symmetries provides the Noether integrals which allow for an
analytic solution of the model.

For the function ( 5.139 ) the Lagrangian ( 5.130 ) becomes for both
cases (if @xmath we have the power-law @xmath )

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.140)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Furthermore there exist a coordinate transformation for which the metric
( 5.132 ) is written in the form of ( 5.87 ).

We introduce new variables @xmath with the relations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.141)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In the new variables the Lagrangian ( 5.140 ) takes the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.142)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The Hamiltonian ( 5.131 ) in the new coordinates is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.143)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The Lagrangian ( 5.142 ) defines a Hamiltonian Riemannian Kepler Ermakov
system with potential

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

from which follows the potential @xmath In addition to the Hamiltonian
the dynamical system admits the Riemannian Ermakov invariant

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.144)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The Lagrangian ( 5.142 ) admits the extra Noether point symmetry @xmath
with Noether integral @xmath (see Table 5.2 ). The three integrals
@xmath and @xmath are in involution and independent, therefore the
system is integrable.

#### 5.9 Conclusion

In this Chapter we have considered the generalization of the autonomous
Kepler Ermakov dynamical system in the spirit of Leach [ 56 ] , that is
using invariance with respect to the @xmath Lie and Noether algebra. We
have generalized the autonomous Newtonian Hamiltonian Kepler Ermakov
system to three dimensions using Noether rather than Lie point
symmetries and have determined all such systems which are Liouville
integrable via Noether point symmetries. We introduced the autonomous
Riemannian Kepler Ermakov system in a Riemannian space which admits a
gradient HV. This system is the generalization of the autonomous
Euclidian Kepler Ermakov system and opens new fields of applications for
the autonomous Kepler Ermakov system, especially in relativistic
Physics. Indeed we have determined the autonomous Riemannian Kepler
Ermakov system in a spatially flat FRW spacetime which admits a gradient
HV. As a further application we have considered two types of
cosmological models, which are described by the autonomous Riemannian
Kepler Ermakov system, the scalar field cosmology with exponential
potential and @xmath gravity in an LRS spacetime.

### Appendix 5.A Appendix

We require that the force admits two Lie symmetries which are due to the
gradient HV @xmath (if we require the force to be invariant under three
Lie symmetries which are due to the gradient HV then it is reduced to
the isotropic oscillator). From Theorem 4.2.2 of Chapter 4 we have the
following cases.

(I) Case @xmath
In this case the Lie symmetries are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The condition which the force must satisfy is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Replacing components we find the equations

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

from which follows

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Because the HV is gradient, Case II of Theorem 4.2.2 applies and gives
the condition

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

from which follows @xmath and @xmath . Therefore

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

(II) Case @xmath
In this case the Lie symmetries are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The condition which the force must satisfy is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We demand @xmath and obtain the system of equations:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

whose solution is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where we have set @xmath .

## Part III Symmetries of PDEs

### Chapter 6 Lie symmetries of a general class of PDEs

#### 6.1 Introduction

In the previous chapters we studied the relation between point
symmetries (Lie and Noether symmetries) of second order ordinary
differential equations. Particularly, we considered the case of geodesic
equations and the equations of motion of a particle moving in a
Riemannian space. We made clear that there exists a unique relation
between the point symmetries and the special projective Lie algebra of
the underlying space in which the motion occurs.

In subsequent sections, we will attempt to extend the relation between
point symmetries and collineations of the space to the case of second
order partial differential equations. Obviously, a global answer to this
problem is not possible. However, it will be shown that for many
interesting PDEs, the Lie point symmetries are indeed obtained from the
collineations of the metric. Pioneering work in this direction is the
work of Ibragimov [ 4 ] . Recently, Bozhkov et al. [ 90 ] have studied
the Lie and the Noether point symmetries of the Poisson equation and
showed that the Lie symmetries of the Poisson PDE are generated from the
conformal algebra of the metric.

In this chapter we show that for a general class of second order PDEs,
there is a close relation between the Lie symmetries and the conformal
algebra of the underlying space. Subsequently, we apply these results to
a number of interesting PDEs and regain existing results in a unified
manner.

In Section 6.2 we examine the generic PDE of the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

and derive the Lie symmetry conditions. Furthermore, in case @xmath is
independent on @xmath i.e. @xmath , then the Lie point symmetries of (
6.1 ) are related to the Conformal vectors (CVs) of the linear
homogeneous differential geometric object @xmath In Section 6.3 we
consider @xmath to be linear in @xmath and determine the Lie point
symmetry conditions in geometric form. In sections 6.4 and 6.5 , we
apply the results of section 6.3 in order to determine the Lie point
symmetries of the Poisson equation, the Yamabe equation and the heat
equation with flux in a @xmath dimensional Riemannian space. It will be
shown that the Lie symmetry vectors of the Poisson and the Yamabe
equation are obtained from the conformal algebra of the geometric object
@xmath [ 90 ] whereas the Lie symmetries of the heat equations are
obtained from the homothetic algebra of the metric. Furthermore, we
determine the Lie symmetries of Laplace equation, the Yamabe equation
and the homogeneous heat equation in various Riemannian spaces.

#### 6.2 The case of the second order PDEs

Attempting to establish a general relation between the Lie symmetries of
a second order PDE of the form ( 6.1 ) and the collineations of a
Riemannian space we derive the Lie symmetry conditions of ( 6.1 ) and
relate them with the collineations of the coefficients @xmath which we
consider to be the components of a metric. According to the standard
approach [ 1 , 3 , 4 , 91 ] the symmetry condition is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a function to be determined. @xmath is the second
prolongation of the Lie symmetry vector

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

given by the expression

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where ¹ ¹ 1 See section 2.3.1 .

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The introduction of the function @xmath in ( 6.2 ) causes the variables
@xmath to be independent ² ² 2 See Ibragimov [ 4 ] p. 115 .

The symmetry condition ( 6.2 ) when applied to ( 6.1 ) gives:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

from which follows

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (6.6)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

We note that we cannot deduce the symmetry conditions before we select a
specific form for the function @xmath However, we may determine the
conditions which are due to the second derivative of @xmath because in
these terms no @xmath terms are involved. This observation significantly
reduces the complexity of the remaining symmetry conditions. Following
this, we have the condition

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

from which the following system of equations results

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

The first equation is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

From the second equation we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the last equation gives the constraint

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

It can be easily shown that condition ( 6.7 ) implies @xmath which is a
well known result ³ ³ 3 We give a simple proof for @xmath in Appendix
6.A . A detailed and more general proof can be found in [ 92 ] . . From
the analysis so far, we obtain the first result

###### Proposition 6.2.1

For the infinitesimal generator ( 6.3 ) for all second order PDEs of the
form ( 6.1 ), holds @xmath that is, @xmath Furthermore, condition ( 6.9
) is identically satisfied.

There remains the third symmetry condition ( 6.8 ). We consider the
following cases.
@xmath
We write ( 6.8 ) in an alternative form by considering @xmath to be
linear a homogeneous differential geometric object as follows:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then it follows:

###### Proposition 6.2.2

For the infinitesimal generator ( 6.3 ) for all second order PDEs  of
the form ( 6.1 ) for which @xmath i.e. @xmath the vector @xmath is a CKV
of the linear homogeneous differential geometric object @xmath with
conformal factor ( @xmath

Assuming ⁴ ⁴ 4 The index @xmath refers to the coordinate @xmath whenever
it is involved. @xmath we have
- for @xmath nothing
- for @xmath gives ( 6.10 ) and
- for @xmath ( 6.10 ) becomes

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.11)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

which leads to the following general result.

###### Proposition 6.2.3

For all second order PDEs  of the form @xmath for which @xmath is
nondegenerate the @xmath , that is, @xmath .

By using that @xmath the symmetry condition ( 6.6 ) is simplified as
follows

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (6.12)
              @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

which together with the condition ( 6.10 ) are the complete set of
symmetry conditions for all second order PDEs of the form @xmath . This
class of PDEs is quite general. This fact makes the above result very
useful..

In order to continue, we need to consider special forms for the function
@xmath

#### 6.3 The Lie symmetry conditions for a linear function @xmath

Consider the function @xmath to be linear in @xmath , that is, to be of
the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are arbitrary functions of their arguments. In
this case, the PDE ( 6.1 ) is of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Lie symmetries of this type of PDEs have been studied previously by
Ibragimov [ 4 ] . Assuming that at least one of the components of @xmath
is @xmath the Lie symmetry conditions are ( 6.12 ) and ( 6.10 ).

Replacing @xmath in ( 6.12 ) we find ⁵ ⁵ 5 We ignore the terms with
@xmath because we have already used them to obtain condition ( 6.10 ).
Indeed, it is clear that these terms give @xmath which is precisely
condition ( 6.10 ).

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (6.15)
              @xmath      (6.16)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

from which the subsequent equations follow

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.17)
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.18)
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.19)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Equation ( 6.19 ) gives (because at least one @xmath )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

Equation ( 6.18 ) gives the constraint

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We summarize the above results as follows.

###### Proposition 6.3.1

The determining equations (the Lie symmetry conditions) for the second
order PDEs ( 6.14 ), in which at least one of the @xmath are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.24)
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.25)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Pay paricular attention to the fact that for all second order PDEs of
the form ( 6.14 ), for which, @xmath , i.e @xmath @xmath the @xmath is a
CKV of the metric @xmath Also, in this case @xmath This result
establishes the relation between the Lie symmetries of this type of PDEs
with the collineations of the metric defined by the coefficients @xmath

Moreover, in case the coordinates are @xmath (where @xmath ) @xmath and
@xmath is a nondegenerate metric we have that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

These symmetry relations coincide with those given in [ 4 ] . Finally,
note that equation ( 6.22 ) can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

Having derived the Lie symmetry conditions for the type of PDEs ( 6.14 )
we continue with the computation of the Lie symmetries of some important
PDEs of this form. Before we proceed, we state two Lemmas which will be
used later (for details, see Appendix 6.B ).

###### Lemma 6.3.2

For the Lie derivative of the connection coefficients, the following
properties hold.

a. In flat space (in which @xmath the following identity holds:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

b. For a general metric @xmath satisfying the condition @xmath the
following relation holds:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Lemma 6.3.3

Assume that the vector @xmath is a CKV of the metric @xmath with
conformal factor @xmath i.e. @xmath Then, the following statement is
true:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the dimension of the space.

In the following sections, we study the Lie symmetries of two second
order PDEs which are important in physics. Particularly, we examine the
relation between the Lie symmetries of the Poisson equation and the Heat
conduction equation in a Riemannian manifold with the conformal group of
the space. We will show that the Lie symmetries of the heat conduction
equation relates to the homothetic group of the underlying space whereas
the Lie symmetries of the Poisson equation are associated to the
conformal group of the metric that defines the Laplace operator.

#### 6.4 Symmetries of the Poisson equation in a Riemannian space

The Lie symmetries of the Poisson equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the Laplace operator of the metric @xmath for @xmath
have been given in [ 4 , 90 ] . Here we generalize this result ⁶ ⁶ 6 The
proof is given in Appendix 6.B . for @xmath .

###### Theorem 6.4.1

The Lie symmetries of the Poisson equation ( 6.31 ) @xmath are generated
from the CKVs of the metric @xmath defining the Laplace operator, as
follows

a) for @xmath the Lie symmetry vector is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a CKV with conformal factor @xmath and the following
condition holds

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

b) for @xmath the Lie symmetry vector is

  -- -- -- --------
           (6.34)
  -- -- -- --------

where @xmath is a CKV with conformal factor @xmath and the following
condition holds

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the following subsections, we apply Theorem 6.4.1 for special forms
of the function @xmath .

##### 6.4.1 Lie symmetries of Laplace equation

The Laplace equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

follows from the Poison equation ( 6.31 ) if we consider @xmath
Therefore, Theorem 6.4.1 applies and we have the following result [ 90 ]
.

###### Theorem 6.4.2

The Lie symmetries of Laplace equation ( 6.36 ) @xmath are generated
from the CKVs of the metric @xmath defining the Laplace operator as
follows

a) for @xmath the Lie symmetry vector is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a CKV with conformal factor @xmath , @xmath is a
solution of ( 6.36 ) and the following condition is satisfied

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

b) for @xmath the Lie symmetry vector is

  -- -- -- --------
           (6.39)
  -- -- -- --------

where @xmath is a CKV with conformal factor @xmath and @xmath is a
solution of ( 6.36 ).

##### 6.4.2 Symmetries of conformal Poisson equation in a Riemannian
space

If in the Poisson equation ( 6.31 ) we replace @xmath with

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the Ricci scalar of the metric which defines the Laplace
operator @xmath and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

then, equation ( 6.31 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the conformal Laplace or Yamabe operator acting on
functions on @xmath defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

Equation ( 6.42 ) is called  the conformal Poisson or Yamabe equation
and plays a central role in the study of a conformal class of metrics by
means of the Yamabe invariant (see, e.g. [ 93 ] ). In order to
investigate the Lie symmetries of ( 6.42 ), we make use of Theorem 6.4.1
and find the following result ⁷ ⁷ 7 The proof is given in Appendix 6.B .
.

###### Theorem 6.4.3

The Lie symmetries of the conformal Poisson equation ( 6.42 ) are
generated from the CKVs of the metric @xmath defining the conformal
Laplace operator, as follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a CKV with conformal factor @xmath and the following
condition holds

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

##### 6.4.3 Lie symmetries of the conformal Laplace equation

The conformal Laplace equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

is the conformal Poisson equation ( 6.42 ) for @xmath Therefore, Theorem
6.4.3 applies and we have the following result.

###### Theorem 6.4.4

The Lie symmetries of the conformal Laplace equation ( 6.46 ) are
generated from the CKVs of the metric @xmath of the conformal Laplace
@xmath operator as follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a CKV with conformal factor @xmath and @xmath is a
solution of ( 6.46 ).

In order to compare the Lie symmetries of Laplace equation ( 6.36 ) and
of the conformal Laplace equation ( 6.46 ), we apply the results of the
Theorems 6.4.2 and 6.4.4 in the case of the FRW spacetime with the
following line element

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Laplace operator for the space with Line element ( 6.48 ) is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the metric of the Minkowski spacetime.

According to Theorem 6.4.2 , the Laplace equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

admits eight Lie point symmetries; six Lie symmetries are the KVs ⁸ ⁸ 8
For the conformal algebra of the FRW spacetime see Chapter 3 , [ 45 ] .
of ( 6.48 ) plus the two Lie symmetries @xmath because, for general
@xmath the conformal factors of the CKVs of ( 6.48 ) do not satisfy (
6.49 ).

On the contrary, according to Theorem ( 6.4.4 ), the conformal Laplace
equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

admits seventeen Lie symmetries; fifteen are the CKVs of the metric (
6.48 ) plus the two Lie symmetries @xmath

For special functions @xmath , the Laplace equation ( 6.49 ) admits
extra Lie symmetries; however, the conformal Laplace equation ( 6.50 )
does not admit extra Lie symmetries.

A direct result, which arises from Theorems 6.4.2 and 6.4.4 , is that,
if @xmath is an @xmath dimensional Riemannian space, @xmath , then, if
the Laplace equation ( 6.36 ) in @xmath is invariant under a Lie group
@xmath then, @xmath is a subgroup  of @xmath , i.e. @xmath where @xmath
is a Lie group which leaves invariant the conformal Laplace equation (
6.46 ). The Lie algebras @xmath are identical if the @xmath does not
admit proper CKVs or if all the conformal factors of the CKVs of @xmath
are solutions of the Laplace equation ( 6.36 ). Moreover, if @xmath is a
conformally flat spacetime then, the conformal Laplace equation ( 6.46 )
admits a Lie algebra of @xmath dimension. For instance, the Laplace
equation in the three dimensional sphere ⁹ ⁹ 9 The three dimensional
sphere is a conformally flat space and it is maximall symmetric [ 23 ] .
admits eight Lie point symmetries [ 94 ] while, on the contrary, the
Yamabe equation admits twelve Lie symmetries.

#### 6.5 The heat conduction equation with a flux in a Riemannian space

The heat equation with a flux in an @xmath dimensional Riemannian space
with metric @xmath is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and @xmath is the Laplace operator.

The term @xmath indicates that the system exchanges energy with the
environment. In this case, the Lie symmetry vector is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath .  For this equation, we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For this PDE, the symmetry conditions ( 6.21 ) - ( 6.26 ) become

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

The solution of the symmetry conditions is summarized in Theorem 6.5.1
(for an sketch proof see Appendix 6.B ).

###### Theorem 6.5.1

The Lie symmetries of the heat equation with flux i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

in a @xmath dimensional Riemannian space with metric @xmath are
constructed from the homothetic algebra of the metric as follows:

a. @xmath is a nongradient HV/KV.
The Lie symmetry is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath must satisfy the constraint equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

b. @xmath is a gradient HV/KV.
The Lie symmetry is

  -- -- -- --------
           (6.60)
  -- -- -- --------

where @xmath must satisfy the constraint equation

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (6.61)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Below, we apply Theorem 6.5.1 for special forms of the function @xmath .

##### 6.5.1 The homogeneous heat equation

In the case @xmath i.e equation ( 6.51 ) is the homogeneous heat
equation, we have the following result.

###### Theorem 6.5.2

The Lie symmetries of the homogeneous heat equation in an @xmath
dimensional Riemannian space

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.62)
  -- -------- -- --------

are constructed from the homothetic algebra of the metric @xmath as
follows

a. If @xmath is a nongradient HV/KV of the metric @xmath the Lie
symmetry is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.63)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are constants and @xmath is a solution of the homogeneous
heat equation.

b. If @xmath that is, @xmath is a gradient HV/KV of the metric @xmath
the Lie symmetry is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are constants and @xmath is a solution of the homogeneous
heat equation.

In order to compare the above result with the existing results in the
literature, we consider the heat equation in a Euclidian space of
dimension @xmath Then, in Cartesian coordinates @xmath and @xmath ,
therefore, the homogeneous heat equation is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.65)
  -- -------- -- --------

The homothetic algebra of space consists of the @xmath gradient KVs
@xmath with generating functions @xmath the @xmath nongradient KVs
@xmath which are the rotations and a gradient HV @xmath with gradient
function @xmath According to Theorem 6.5.2 , the Lie symmetries of the
heat equation in the Euclidian @xmath dimensional space are (we may take
@xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

This result is consistent with the results of [ 1 ] pg. 158.

Next, we consider the de Sitter spacetime (a four dimensional space of
constant curvature and Lorentzian character) whose metric is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is known that the homothetic algebra of this space consists of the
ten KVs

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

all of which are nongradient. According to Theorem 6.5.2 , the Lie
symmetries of the heat equation in de Sitter space are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

From Theorem 6.5.2 we have the following additional results.

###### Corollary 6.5.3

The one dimensional homogenous heat equation admits a maximum number of
seven Lie point symmetries (module a solution of the heat equation).

Proof. The homothetic group of a one dimensional metric @xmath consists
of one gradient KV (the @xmath and one gradient HV @xmath . According to
theorem 6.5.2 , from the KV we have two Lie symmetries and from the
gradient HV another two Lie point symmetries. To these we need to add
the two Lie point symmetries @xmath and the trivial Lie symmetry @xmath
where @xmath is a solution of the heat equation.

###### Corollary 6.5.4

The homogeneous heat equation in a space of constant curvature of
dimension @xmath has at most @xmath Lie symmetries (modulo a solution of
the heat equation).

Proof. A space of constant curvature of dimension @xmath admits @xmath
nongradient KVs. To these we need to add the Lie symmetries @xmath

###### Corollary 6.5.5

The heat conduction equation in a space of dimension @xmath admits at
most @xmath Lie symmetries (modulo a solution of the heat equation) and
if this is the case, the space is flat.

Proof. The space with the maximum homothetic algebra is the flat space
which admits @xmath gradient KVs, @xmath nongradient KVs and one
gradient HV. Therefore, from Case 1 of Theorem 6.5.2 we have @xmath Lie
symmetries. From Case 2 of Theorem 6.5.2 , we have @xmath Lie symmetries
and to these we have to add the Lie symmetries @xmath where @xmath is a
solution of the heat equation. The set of all these symmetries is @xmath
@xmath [ 4 ] .

##### 6.5.2 Case @xmath

Let @xmath then the heat conduction equation ( 6.51 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.68)
  -- -------- -- --------

From Theorem 6.5.1 , we have the following results.

###### Theorem 6.5.6

The Lie symmetries of the heat equation ( 6.68 ) in an @xmath
dimensional Riemannian space with metric @xmath are constructed form the
homothetic algebra of the metric as follows.

a. @xmath is a HV/KV. The Lie symmetry is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.69)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the functions @xmath @xmath and @xmath satisfy the condition

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.70)
  -- -------- -- --------

b. @xmath is a gradient HV/KV. The Lie symmetry is

  -- -- -- --------
           (6.71)
  -- -- -- --------

where @xmath is a solution of the homogeneous heat equation, the
functions @xmath @xmath and the flux @xmath satisfy the equation:

  -- -- -- --------
           (6.72)
  -- -- -- --------

For various cases of @xmath we obtain the results of Table ¹⁰ ¹⁰ 10
Where int Table 6.1 @xmath is a HV/KV, @xmath is a gradient HV/KV and
@xmath is a gradient KV. 6.1 .

#### 6.6 Conclusion

The main result of this chapter is Proposition 6.2.2 , which states that
the Lie symmetries of the PDEs of the form  ( 6.2 ) are obtained from
the conformal vectors of the metric defined by the coefficients @xmath
provided @xmath This result is quite general and covers many well known
and important PDEs of Physics. The geometrization of Lie point
symmetries and their association with the collineations of the metric
dissociates their determination from the dimension of the space because
the collineations of the metric depend (in general) on the type of the
metric and not on the dimensions of the space where the metric resides.
Furthermore, this association provides a wealth of results of
Differential Geometry on collineations, which is possible to be used in
the determination of Lie pont symmetries.

We have applied the above theoretical results to the Poisson equation,
the conformal Poisson (Yamabe) equation and the heat equation. We proved
that the Lie symmetries of the Poisson equations (Laplace/Yamabe) are
generated from the elements of the conformal group of the metric that
defines the Laplace/Yamabe operator.

For the heat conduction equation, we proved that the Lie symmetries are
generated from the homothetic group of the underlying metric.
Furthermore, we specialized the equation to the homogeneous heat
conduction equation and regained the existing results for the Newtonian
case.

In the following chapter. we apply the theoretical results of this
chapter to study the correlation of point symmetries between Classical
and Quantum systems.

### Appendix 6.A Appendix A

We prove the statement for @xmath . The generalization to any @xmath is
straightforward. For a general proof, see [ 92 ] . We consider @xmath as
a matrix and assume that the inverse of this matrix exists. We denote
the inverse matrix with @xmath and we get from ( 6.7 )

where @xmath is the conformal factor of @xmath i.e. @xmath .
Furthermore, we have

     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath

Finally, from ( 6.75 ), we have the constraint

     @xmath      (6.81)
  -- -------- -- --------

For @xmath holds that @xmath this means that @xmath From ( 6.77 ),
@xmath is a CKV with conformal factor

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.82)
  -- -------- -- --------

and @xmath Finally, from ( 6.75 ), we have the constraint

     @xmath      (6.83)
  -- -------- -- --------

Proof of Theorem 6.4.3 . By replacing @xmath in ( 6.33 ) where @xmath ,
we have the symmetry condition

But @xmath is a CKV with conformal factor @xmath . @xmath That implies [

and this implies for the terms in ( 6.84 )

Hence, condition become ( 6.84 ) finally becomes

Proof of Theorem 6.5.1 . Condition ( 6.56 ) means that @xmath is a CKV
of the metric @xmath with conformal factor @xmath Condition ( 6.55 )
implies @xmath where @xmath is a HV with conformal factor @xmath that
is, we have:

from which follows

We consider the following cases:

Case 1: @xmath is a HV/KV. From ( 6.87 ), we have that @xmath and @xmath
Then, ( 6.88 ) becomes

     @xmath      (6.89)

### Chapter 7 Point symmetries of Schrödinger and the Klein Gordon
equations

#### 7.1 Introduction

The Schrödinger and the Klein Gordon equations are two important
equations of Quantum Physics. Therefore, it is important that we
determine their Lie symmetries and use them either in order to find
invariant solutions using Lie symmetry methods [ 1 ] . In order to
achieve this, we notice that the Schrödinger equation is a special case
of the heat conduction equation and the Klein Gordon equation is a
special form of the Poisson equation. The Lie symmetries of the heat
equation and of the Poisson equation in a general Riemannian space were
determined in Chapter 6 . Thus, we apply these results to find the Lie
symmetries of the Schrödinger and the Klein Gordon equation in a general
Riemannian space.

An important element of the present study is the concept of conformally
related Lagrangians, that is, Lagrangians that under under a conformal
transformation of the metric and the potential lead to the same
equations but for different dynamic variables. The condition for this is
that the Hamiltonian vanishes. Because the dynamic variables of these
Lagrangians are not the standard ones in general the Hamiltonian is not
relevant to the energy of the system.

From each Lagrangian describing a dynamical system, we define a metric
called the kinematic metric, characteristic to the dynamical system
described by this Lagrangian. As it will be seen, the conformal
symmetries of this metric are in close relation to the Noether
symmetries of the equations of motion. Furthermore, the kinetic metric
of the Lagrangian defines the Laplace operator; hence, consequently the
Lie symmetries of the corresponding Poisson equation are expressed in
terms of the conformal symmetries of the kinematic metric. We extend
these results to the Yamabe operator and study the Lie symmetries of the
conformal Klein Gordon equation.

In section 7.2 , we consider the classical Lagrangian

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

in a general Riemannian space and we show that the Noether point
symmetries of two conformally related Lagrangians are generated from the
conformal algebra of the metric @xmath

In section 7.3 , we  study the Lie point symmetries of Schrödinger and
the Klein Gordon equation by using the resutls of Chapter 6 . Using the
geometric character of the Noether symmetries for the Lagrangian ( 7.1 )
and that of the Lie symmetries of the Schrödinger and of the Klein
Gordon equation we establish the connection between the two. More
specifically, it will be shown that if an element of the homothetic
group of the kinetic metric generates a Noether point symmetry for the
classical Lagrangian, then it also generates a Lie point symmetry for
the Schrödinger equation. Concerning the Klein Gordon we find that the
Noether symmetry of the Lagrangian ( 7.1 ) must have a constant Noether
gauge function in order to be admitted.

In section 7.4 , we examine the case of Noether symmetries whose Noether
gauge functions are not constant. We will consider the cases the
kinematic metric admits a gradient Killing vector (KV) or a gradient
homothetic vector (HV) which produces Noether point symmetries for the
Lagrangian ( 7.1 ) and show that the Lie symmetry in both cases is
indeed a non-local symmetry of the Klein Gordon equation. In section 7.5
, we demonstrate the use of the previous general results to various
interesting practical situations.

To complete our analysis, in section 7.7 , we examine the WKB
approximation. In that case, the solution of the Klein Gordon equation
satisfies the null Hamilton Jacobi equation. We derive the symmetry
condition of the null Hamilton Jacobi equation and we prove that its Lie
point symmetries are generated from the CKVs of the underlying space.
Furthermore, there exists a unique relation between the Lie point
symmetries of the Hamilton Jacobi and the Lie symmetries of the
Euler-Lagrange equations of a classical particle; in particularly, the
Lie point symmetries of the Euler-Lagrange equations which are generated
from the homothetic algebra of the Riemannian space are generating point
symmetries for the Hamilton Jacobi equation; that is, the Lie symmetry
algebra of the Hamilton Jacobi equation can be greater than the Noether
algebra of the classical Lagrangian ( 7.1 ).

#### 7.2 Noether symmetries of Conformal Lagrangians

Consider the Lagrangian of a particle moving under the action of a
potential @xmath in a Riemannian space with metric @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath The equations of motion follow from the action

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

Consider the change of variable @xmath defined by the requirement

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the new coordinates @xmath the action becomes

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and the Lagrangian is transformed to the new Lagrangian

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

If we consider a conformal transformation (not a coordinate
transformation!) of the metric @xmath and a new potential function
@xmath then, the new Lagrangian @xmath in the new coordinates @xmath ,
takes the form,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

implying that equation ( 7.7 ) is of the same form as the Lagrangian
@xmath in equation ( 7.2 ). From now on, the Lagrangian @xmath of
equation ( 7.2 ) and the Lagrangian @xmath of equation ( 7.7 ) will be
called conformal. In this framework, the action remains the same, i.e.
it is invariant under the change of parameter and the equations of
motion in the new variables @xmath will be the same with the equations
of motion for the Lagrangian @xmath in the original coordinates @xmath .

In Chapter 4 , it was shown that the Noether point symmetries of a
Lagrangian of the form ( 7.2 ) follow from the homothetic algebra of the
metric @xmath (see Theorem 4.3.2 ). The same applies to the Lagrangian
@xmath and the metric @xmath The conformal algebra of the metrics @xmath
(as a set) is the same; however, their closed subgroups of HVs and KVs
are generally different. Hence, the following Corollary holds.

###### Corollary 7.2.1

The Noether point symmetries of the conformally related Lagrangians (
7.2 ), ( 7.7 ) are contained in the common conformal algebra of the
metrics @xmath

Now, we formulate and prove the following Lemma;

###### Lemma 7.2.2

The Euler-Lagrange equations for two conformal Lagrangians transform
covariantly under the conformal transformation relating the Lagrangians
if and only if the Hamiltonian vanishes.

Proof. Consider the Lagrangian @xmath whose Euler-Lagrange equations
are:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath are the Christofell symbols. The corresponding Hamiltonian
is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

For the conformally related Lagrangian @xmath where @xmath the resulting
Euler Lagrange equations are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the corresponding Hamiltonian is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

In order to show that the two equations of motion are conformally
related we start from equation( 7.10 ) and apply the conformal
transformation

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

By replacing in equation( 7.10 ). we find:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By replacing @xmath from equation( 7.11 ), we have

  -- -------- -------- --
              @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

from which follows

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Obviously, the above Euler-Lagrange equations coincide with equations(
7.8 ) if and only if @xmath , which implies that the Hamiltonian of
equation( 7.9 ) vanishes. The steps are reversible; hence, the inverse
is also true.

The physical meaning of this result is that systems with vanishing
energy are conformally invariant at the level of the equations of
motion.

#### 7.3 Lie point symmetries of Schrödinger and the Klein Gordon
equation

In this section we study the Lie point symmetries of Schrödinger and the
Klein Gordon equation in  a Riemannian manifold. To do this, we use the
results of Chapter 6 . Furthermore, we will study the relation between
Noether pont symmetries of classical Lagrangians and Lie point
symmetries of the Schrödinger and the Klein Gordon equation with the
same ”kinetic” metric and the same potential.

##### 7.3.1 Symmetries of the Schrödinger equation

The Schrödinger equation ¹ ¹ 1 We have absorbed the constant @xmath and
the imaginary unit @xmath , in the variables @xmath respectively

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

is a special form of the heat conduction equation ( 6.51 ) with @xmath
Therefore, it is possible to study the Lie point symmetries of the
Schrödinger equation using Theorem 6.5.1 which, in this case, takes the
following form.

###### Theorem 7.3.1

The Lie point symmetries of the Schrödinger equation ( 7.13 ) are
generated from the elements of the homothetic algebra of the metric
@xmath as follows.

a. @xmath is a non-gradient HV/KV.  The Lie symmetry is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

with constraint equations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

b @xmath is a gradient HV/KV. The Lie symmetry is

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

with constraint equations

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.16)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.17)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

and the functions @xmath are computed from the relations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

From the form of the symmetry vectors and the symmetry conditions for
the Schrödinger and the Lagrangian of the classical particle ( 7.2 ) we
have the following result.

###### Proposition 7.3.2

If a KV/HV of the metric @xmath produces a Lie point symmetry for the
Schrödinger equation ( 7.13 ), then generates a Noether point symmetry
for the Lagrangian ( 7.2 ) in the space with metric @xmath and potential
@xmath The reverse is also true.

##### 7.3.2 Symmetries of the Klein Gordon equation

The Klein-Gordon equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

follows from the Poisson equation ( 6.31 ) if we take @xmath Therefore,
Theorem 6.4.1 applies and we have the following result

###### Theorem 7.3.3

The Lie point symmetries of the Klein Gordon equation ( 7.19 ) @xmath
are generated from the CKVs of the metric @xmath defining the Laplace
operator, as follows

a) for @xmath the Lie symmetry vector is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a CKV with conformal factor @xmath , @xmath is a
solution of ( 7.19 ) and the following condition is satisfied

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

b) for @xmath the Lie symmetry vector is

  -- -- -- --------
           (7.22)
  -- -- -- --------

where @xmath is a CKV with conformal factor @xmath , @xmath is a
solution of ( 7.19 ) and the following condition is satisfied

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

By comparing the symmetry condition of the Klein Gordon equation ( 7.19
) and the classical Lagrangian ( 7.2 ) and by taking into consideration
that for a special CKV/HV/KV the conformal factor satisfies the
condition @xmath we deduce the following result.

###### Proposition 7.3.4

For @xmath the Lie point symmetries of the Klein Gordon equation for the
metric @xmath which defines the Laplace operator are related to the
Noether point symmetries of the classical Lagrangian for the same metric
and the same potential as follows

a) If a KV or HV of the metric @xmath generates a Lie point symmetry of
the Klein Gordon equation ( 7.19 ), then it also produces a Noether
point symmetry of the classical Lagrangian with gauge function a
constant.

b) If a special CKV or a proper CKV satisfying the condition @xmath of
the metric @xmath generates a Lie point symmetry of the Klein Gordon
equation ( 7.19 ), then it also generates a Noether point symmetry of
the conformally related Lagrangian if there exists a conformal factor
@xmath such that the CKV becomes a KV or a HV.

For @xmath the results are different and are given below.

##### 7.3.3 Symmetries of the Conformal Klein Gordon equation

The conformal Klein Gordon equation (or Yamabe Klein Gordon)

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

is the conformal Poisson equation ( 6.42 ) for @xmath Therefore, Theorem
6.4.3 is valid and we have the result.

###### Theorem 7.3.5

The Lie point symmetries of the conformal Klein Gordon equation ( 7.24 )
are as follows

a) For @xmath they @xmath are generated from the CKVs of the metric
@xmath of the conformal Laplace @xmath operator, as follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a CKV with conformal factor @xmath and the following
conditions are satisfied

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

b) For @xmath , equation ( 7.24 ) is the Laplace Klein Gordon equation (
7.19 ) and the results of theorem 7.3.3 apply.

Comparing the symmetry condition of the conformal Klein Gordon equation
( 7.24 ) and the classical Lagrangian ( 7.2 ) we have the following
proposition.

###### Proposition 7.3.6

a) If a CKV of the metric @xmath ( @xmath ), which defines the conformal
Laplace operator, produces a Lie point symmetry of the conformal Klein
Gordon equation ( 7.24 ), then the same vector generates a Noether point
symmetry of the conformally related Lagrangian provided there exists a
conformal factor @xmath such that the CKV becomes a KV/HV of @xmath .

b) If a KV/HV of the metric @xmath generates a Lie point symmetry for
the conformal Klein Gordon equation ( 7.24 ) then the same vector
generates a Noether point symmetry for the classical Lagrangian with
gauge function a constant.

#### 7.4 @xmath and the Klein Gordon equation

In the previous considerations, we have showed that the Lie point
symmetries of the Klein Gordon equation induce Noether point symmetries
for the classical Lagrangian if the gauge function is a constant. In
this section, we investigate the case when the induced Noether symmetry
has a gauge function which is not a constant. As we shall show in this
case, the induced Noether symmetry comes from a generalized Lie symmetry
of the Klein Gordon equation.

It is clear that if a KV/HV produces a Noether point symmetry for the
classical Lagrangian satisfying conditions ( 4.29 ) with @xmath or (
4.31 ) with @xmath (or @xmath ) of Theorem 4.3.2 , then it does not
produce a Lie symmetry for the Klein Gordon equation. However, a
gradient KV/HV which generates a Noether point symmetry for the
classical Lagrangian satisfies only condition ( 4.31 ) with @xmath and
@xmath and leads to two well known dynamical systems, the oscillator and
the Ermakov system . The Lie and the Noether point symmetries of these
dynamical systems have been considered previously in Chapter 5 ;
however, we briefly reproduce these results in the current framework for
competences.

##### 7.4.1 The oscillator

First, we consider the case in which the metric admits a gradient KV
which generates Lie point symmetries of the classical Lagrangian,
provided condition ( 4.31 ) is satisfied. It is well known that if a
metric admits a gradient KV, then it is decomposable and can be written
in the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the gradient KV is @xmath and @xmath is the tensor projecting
normal to the KV. In these coordinates the Lagrangian takes the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Lie point symmetry condition for the gradient KV becomes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

from which follows that the potential is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Noether point symmetries are the vectors @xmath with respective
gauge function @xmath . The corresponding Noether integrals are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

It can be easily shown that the combined Noether integral @xmath is time
independent and equals

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Laplace Klein Gordon equation defined by the metric ( 7.28 ) and the
potential ( 7.30 ) is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

This equation does not admit a Lie point symmetry for general @xmath
@xmath However, it is separable with respect to @xmath in the sense that
the solution can be written in the form @xmath This implies that the
operator @xmath satisfies @xmath which means that the Klein Gordon
equation ( 7.33 ) possesses a Lie Bäcklund symmetry [ 96 , 97 ] with
generating vector @xmath . @xmath

Concerning the conformal Klein Gordon equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

because for a KV, say @xmath we have @xmath [ 95 ] hence @xmath equation
( 7.34 ) is written in the form of the Laplace Klein Gordon equation
with @xmath and the previous result applies.

##### 7.4.2 The Kepler Ermakov potential with an oscillator term

We assume now that there exists a gradient HV which produces a Noether
point symmetry for the classical Lagrangian under the constraint
condition ( 4.31 ). It is well known [ 83 , 98 ] that if a metric admits
a gradient HV, then there exists a coordinate system in which the metric
has the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the HV is @xmath @xmath and @xmath is the tensor projecting normal
to @xmath s For these coordinates, the Lagrangian is

  -- -- -- --------
           (7.35)
  -- -- -- --------

and the gradient HV generates Lie point symmetries only for the Ermakov
potential extended by the oscillator term, that is,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

The admitted Noetheroint symmetries generated from the gradient HV
@xmath are the vectors @xmath with corresponding gauge functions @xmath
and corresponding Noether integrals ( 5.97 ) and ( 5.98 ). From the
Noether integrals ( 5.97 ),( 5.98 ) and the Hamiltonian @xmath of ( 7.35
) we construct the time independent first integral @xmath which is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is the well known Ermakov invariant [ 67 , 53 ] .

The Laplace Klein Gordon equation defined by the metric ( 7.35 ) and the
potential  ( 7.36 ) is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

This equation does not admit a Lie point symmetry. However it is
separable in the sense that @xmath Then the operator

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

satisfies the equation @xmath which means that ( 7.38 ) admits the
Bäcklund  symmetry with generator @xmath [ 96 , 97 ] .

Concerning the conformal Klein Gordon equation, the Ricci scalar of the
metric ( 7.35 ) and the HV satisfy the condition @xmath [ 95 ] , that is
@xmath Then, as in the case of the gradient KV we absorb the term @xmath
into the potential and we obtain the same results with the Laplace Klein
Gordon equation.

From the above, we conclude that, although in the two cases considered
above the Lie symmetries do not transfer from the classical to the
”quantum” level the generalized symmetries do transfer.

#### 7.5 Applications

We apply the previous general results in two practical cases. The first
case concerns the Newtonian central motion and the second the
classification of potentials in two and three dimensional flat spaces
for which the Schrödinger equation and the Klein Gordon equation admit
Lie symmetries.

##### 7.5.1 Euclidean central force

Consider the autonomous classical Lagrangian

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is well known that ( 7.39 ) admits as Noether point symmetries (a)
the gradient KV @xmath ( autonomous) with Noether integral the
Hamiltonian and (b) the KV @xmath , with constant gauge function and
Noether integral the angular momentum @xmath . Lagrangian ( 7.39 )
admits extra Noether symmetries for the values @xmath (the free
particle) and @xmath (the Ermakov potential) [ 79 ] . In the following
we assume @xmath hence, we do not expect to find symmetries.

From the Lagrangian ( 7.39 ), we consider the kinematic metric and
define the Schrödinger equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the Klein Gordon equation (because the dimension of the kinematic
metric is two, the Laplace and the Yamabe operators coincide)

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

The application of the results of the previous sections give the
following

a. The Schrödinger equation ( 7.40 ) admits as Lie point symmetries the
vectors

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

b. The Klein Gordon equation ( 7.41 ) admits as Lie point symmetries the
vectors

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
                                
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

It can be easily observed that @xmath are proper CKVs of the two
dimensional flat kinematic metric.

Concerning the Schrödinger equation, it has the same Lie point
symmetries as the Lagrangian ( 7.39 ) hence there is nothing more to do.
However, the Klein Gordon equation has the extra Lie symmetries @xmath
hence it is possible to apply the results of proposition 7.3.6 in order
to find a conformally related Lagrangian which will admit the pair of
symmetries @xmath or @xmath .

It is important to note that if we use the zero order invariants of the
Lie symmetry @xmath to reduce the Schrödinger equation ( 7.40 ), we find
that the reduced equation is the Klein Gordon equation ( 7.41 ).
Therefore, the symmetries @xmath are Type II hidden symmetries [ 99 , 14
, 100 ] for the Schrödinger equation ( 7.40 ).

Let us consider the vector @xmath It is easy to show, that the conformal
metric

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath and @xmath is an arbitrary function of @xmath admits @xmath
as a KV. This leads to the family of conformal Lagrangians

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath means derivative with respect to the conformal “time”
@xmath and the coordinate transformation is @xmath . According to
proposition 7.3.6 , the vector field @xmath generates a Noether point
symmetry for the Lagrangian ( 7.42 ).

Working similarly for the vector @xmath we find another family of
conformally related Lagrangians which admit @xmath as a Noether point
symmetry.

The conformally related Lagrangians are possible to admit additional
Noether point symmetries than the sets @xmath or @xmath For example in
the case of @xmath we consider the conformally related Lagrangian
defined by the function @xmath i.e.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which, by means of the coordinate transformation @xmath becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is the Lagrangian of the free particle moving in the 2D flat space.

##### 7.5.2 Lie symmetry classification of Schrödinger and the Klein
Gordon equations in Euclidian space

In Chapter 4 , all two and three dimensional  potentials for which the
corresponding Newtonian dynamical systems admit Lie and/or Noether point
were determined. Using these results, we determine all Schrödinger and
Klein Gordon equations in Euclidian 2D and 3D space which admit Lie
point symmetries.

The Schrödinger equation in Euclidian space is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

From proposition 7.3.2 , we have that the potentials for which the
Schrödinger equation ( 7.44 ) admits Lie symmetries are the same with
the ones admitted by the classical Lagrangian. Therefore, the results of
Chapter 4 apply directly and give all potentials for which the
Schrödinger equation ( 7.44 ) admits at least one Lie symmetry.

We consider the Klein Gordon equation in flat space;that is,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this case, the conditions are different and we find that equation (
7.45 ) admits a Lie point symmetry due to a HV/KV for the following
potentials taken from the corresponding Tables of Chapter 4 . In Table
7.1 and Table 7.2 we provide the potentials where the 2D and 3D Klein
Gordon equation ( 7.45 ) admits Lie point symmetries generated from the
elements of the homothetic group of the Euclidian space.

As we have seen in section 7.3.2 , the Lie point symmetries of the Klein
Gordon equation are generated from the conformal group of the space;
therefore, we have to consider the admitted CKVs in addition to the
HV and the KVs.

###### The two dimensional case

We recall that the conformal algebra of a two dimensional space is
infinite dimensional [ 101 ] and in coordinates with line element @xmath
are given by the vectors @xmath with conformal factor @xmath . In the
coordinates @xmath the 2D Klein Gordon Klein Gordon equation ( 7.45 ) is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The Lie symmetry condition ( 7.21 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

from which follows that there are infinite many potentials for which the
2D Klein Gordon equation admits Lie point symmetries.

###### The three dimensional case

The 3D Euclidian space admits the three special CKVs

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with corresponding conformal factor @xmath .

From the symmetry condition ( 7.21 ) of theorem 7.3.3 , it follows that
a special CKV generates the Lie point symmetry @xmath for the 3D Klein
Gordon ( 7.45 ) only for the potential

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

One is possible to continue with the linear combinations and deduce all
cases that the 3D Klein Gordon equation admits a Lie symmetry. These
results hold for both the Klein Gordon and the conformal Klein Gordon
equation. It particular one can show that the results remain still valid
for the conformal Klein Gordon equation provided the metric defining the
conformal Laplacian is conformally flat.

#### 7.6 The Klein Gordon equation in a spherically symmetric space-time

In this section, we consider the Lie point symmetries of the Klein
Gordon equation in a non-flat space and in particular in the static
spherically symmetric empty space-time; that is the exterior
Schwarzschild solution given by the metric ( @xmath is the radial
coordinate)

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Lagrangian of Einstein field equations for this space-time is [ 102
, 103 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath means derivative with respect to the radius @xmath . If we
see the Lagrangian ( 7.48 ) as a dynamical system in the space of
variables @xmath , then this system is ”autonomous”; hence, admits the
Noether symmetry @xmath with corresponding Noether integral the
”Hamiltonian” @xmath constant. ( @xmath is not the ”energy” because the
coordinate is the radial distance not the time)

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It can be shown directly that @xmath where @xmath is the Einstein
tensor. Because the space is empty, from Einstein’s equations follows
that @xmath The Euler-Lagrange equations are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We end up with a system of three equations whose solution will give the
functions @xmath It is found that the solution of the system does not
give these functions in the well known closed form. This is due to the
Lagrangian we have considered; Indeed we shall show below that it is
possible to find the solution in closed form by considering a Lagrangian
conformally related to the Lagrangian ( 7.48 ).

Applying Theorem 4.3.2 , we find that the Lagrangian ( 7.48 ) admits the
Noether point symmetry

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is a non-gradient homothetic vector of the two dimensional
kinetic metric

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

defined from the Lagrangian ( 7.48 ).

The Klein Gordon equation defined by the metric ( 7.49 ) with potential
@xmath , is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

and admits as Lie symmetries the vectors [ 103 ]

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the vectors @xmath are proper CKVs of the two dimensional metric (
7.49 ).

It is possible to find solutions of the Klein Gordon equation ( 7.50 )
which are invariant with respect to one of the admitted Lie symmetries.

For example, let us consider the Lie point symmetry @xmath The zero
order invariants of @xmath are @xmath Replacing in the PDE we find the
solution ² ² 2 We have found this by making use of the library SADE [
104 ] of MAPLE.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath are the Bessel modified functions [ 103 ] . Working
similarly for the Lie point symmetry @xmath we find the solution

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

One can find more solutions using linear combinations of the Lie
symmetries.

Following proposition 7.3.6 , we look for a conformal metric for which
one of the CKVs @xmath becomes a KV and write the corresponding
conformally related Lagrangian which admits this CKV as a Noether point
symmetry.

We consider the vector @xmath and the conformally related metric

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath is an arbitrary function of its argument @xmath
It is easy to show that the vector @xmath is a KV of this metric hence a
Noether symmetry for the family of conformally related Lagrangians

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have considered the coordinate transformation @xmath . The
Noether function for this Noether symmetry is the ”Hamiltonian” of the
Lagrangian ( 7.52 ). This constant and the two Lagrange equations for
the ”generalized” coordinates @xmath provide a system of differential
equations which will give the functions @xmath

We consider @xmath constant, that is from the family of Lagrangians (
7.52 ) we take the Lagrangian

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

For this Lagrangian we have the following system of equations:
a.  The ”Hamiltonian” of the Lagrangian ( 7.53 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

b. @xmath The Euler Lagrange equations of ( 7.53 ) with respect to the
variables @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have set @xmath . The solution of the system of equations (
7.54 )-( 7.56 ) is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Under the linear transformation @xmath and if we set @xmath , we obtain
the exterior Schwarzschild solution in the standard coordinates

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

The choice of the function @xmath is essentially a choice of the
coordinate system. Obviously the final solution must always be the
exterior Schwarzschild solution. In order to show this let us consider
@xmath so that @xmath Then, we get the Lagrangian

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

and the system of equations

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The solution of the system is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

from which follows: @xmath Therefore, for this choice of Lagrangian, the
metric is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

If we make the transformation @xmath , @xmath and @xmath we retain the
metric ( 7.58 ) in the standard form ( 7.51 ).

Working similarly, we find that @xmath becomes a KV for the conformal
metric ( 7.51 ) if @xmath and generates a Noether point symmetry for the
conformal Lagrangian ( 7.52 ) (with @xmath in the place of @xmath and
continue as above.

#### 7.7 WKB approximation

In WKB approximation, we search for solutions of the Klein Gordon
equation of the form @xmath where @xmath has to satisfy the null
Hamilton Jacobi equation [ 105 , 106 ] .

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the metric defining the Yamabe operator and @xmath . We
study the symmetries of the PDE ( 7.59 ).

We search for Lie point symmetries of the form [ 1 ]

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The symmetry condition is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the first prolongation and @xmath . Replacing the first
prolongation @xmath in the symmetry condition and collecting terms of
powers of @xmath we find the following result.

###### Theorem 7.7.1

The Lie point symmetries of the null Hamilton Jacobi equation ( 7.59 )
are the vectors

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a CKV of the metric @xmath @xmath are constants and the
following condition holds

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

Proof . The symmetry condition is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the first prolongation and we set @xmath . Replacing
@xmath we find

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We can easily show that @xmath so that the the symmetry conditions
become:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.62)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.63)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.64)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

From ( 7.62 ) and ( 7.64 ) we have that @xmath . Then, the conditions (
7.62 ),( 7.63 ) become

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.65)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.66)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Setting @xmath or @xmath we see that condition ( 7.65 ) implies that the
Lie point symmetries of the null Hamilton Jacobi equation ( 7.59 ) are
generated from the CKVs of the the kinematic metric @xmath . Finally,
condition ( 7.66 ) becomes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Comparing the symmetry condition ( 7.61 ) of the null Hamilton Jacobi
equation and the symmetry condition ( 7.26 ) of the Yamabe Klein Gordon
equation, we have

###### Proposition 7.7.2

If a CKV of the metric which defines the Yamabe operator generates a Lie
point symmetry for the Yamabe Klein Gordon equation ( 7.24 ), then the
same vector generates a Lie point symmetry of the null Hamilton Jacobi
equation ( 7.59 ). The reverse holds if the CKV generating Lie symmetry
for the null Hamilton Jacobi equation ( 7.59 ) satisfies condition (
7.61 ) with @xmath .

Proposition 7.7.2 relates the Lie point symmetries of the Hamilton
Jacobi equation with the Lie point symmetries of the Yamabe Klein Gordon
when the constant @xmath . The question which arises is what happens to
the Lie symmetries when @xmath . The answer is given in the following
proposition

###### Proposition 7.7.3

If a CKV generates Lie point symmetry for the null Hamilton Jacobi
equation ( 7.59 ) satisfying condition ( 7.61 ) with @xmath , then this
CKV produces a Lie point symmetry for the Euler-Lagrange equations for a
conformally related Lagrangian  if there exist a conformal factor @xmath
for which the CKV becomes KV or HV.

Proof . The Lie point symmetries of the autonomous system

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

are produced from the special projective algebra of the metric provided
the potential satisfies the condition

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.68)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a constant and @xmath denotes Lie derivative with
respect to @xmath . Equation ( 7.67 ) remains the same for the
conformally related Lagrangian, that is, we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Therefore, the symmetry group will be again the special projective group
of the conformal metric. The special projective group is not preserved
under a conformal transformation but the subgroups of KVs and the
homothetic group are preserved. Then these two subgroups are common for
both metrics. Subsequetly, if the CKV of the metric @xmath becomes a
KV/HV of the conformal metric @xmath then it will be a Lie point
symmetry of the Euler Lagrange equations of the conformally related
Lagrangian @xmath . This symmetry will not be a Noether symmetry of
@xmath except in the case that @xmath

#### 7.8 Conclusion

We have determined the Lie point symmetries of Schrödinger equation and
the Klein Gordon equation in a general Riemannian space. It has been
shown that these symmetries are related to the homothetic algebra and
the conformal algebra of the metric. Furthermore, these symmetries have
been related to the Noether point symmetries of the classical Lagrangian
for which the metric @xmath is the kinematic metric. More precisely, for
the Schrödinger equation ( 7.13 ) it has been shown that if a KV/HV of
the metric @xmath produces a Lie point symmetry of the Schrödinger
equation, then it produces a Noether point symmetry for the Classical
Lagrangian in the space with metric @xmath and potential @xmath . For
the Klein Gordon equation the situation is different; the Lie point
symmetries of the Klein Gordon are generated by elements of the
conformal group of the metric @xmath The KVs and the HV of this group
produce a Noether symmetry of the classical Lagrangian with a constant
gauge function. However the proper CKVs produce a Noether point symmetry
for the conformal Lagrangian if there exists a conformal factor @xmath
such that the CKV becomes a KV/HV of @xmath .

We have applied these general results to three cases of practical
interest: the motion in a central potential, the classification of all
potentials in Euclidian 2D and 3D space for which the Schrödinger
equation and the Klein Gordon equation admit a Lie point symmetry and
finally we have considered the Lie symmetries of the Klein Gordon
equations in the static, spherically symmetric empty spacetime. In the
last case, we have demonstrated the role of Lie symmetries and that of
the conformal Lagrangians in the determination of the closed form
solution of Einstein equations.

Furthermore, we investigated the Lie symmetries of the null Hamilton
Jacobi equation and we proved that if a CKV generates a point symmetry
for the Klein Gordon equation, then it also generates a Lie point
symmetry for the null Hamilton Jacobi equation.

The knowledge of the Lie symmetries of the Schrödinger equation and the
Klein Gordon equation in a general Riemannian space makes possible the
determination of solutions of these equations which are invariant under
a given Lie symmetry. In addition, they can be used in Quantum Cosmology
[ 107 , 108 , 109 , 110 , 105 ] to determine the form of solutions of
the Wheeler–DeWitt equation [ 111 ] in a given Riemannian space.

### Chapter 8 The geometric origin of Type II hidden symmetries

#### 8.1 Introduction

Lie symmetries assist us in the simplification of differential equations
(DEs) by means of reduction. As it was indicated in Chapter 2 , the
reduction is different for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and
partial differential equations (PDEs). In the case of ODEs, the use of a
Lie symmetry reduces the order of ODE by one while in the case of PDEs,
the reduction by a Lie symmetry reduces by one the number of independent
and dependent variables, but not the order of the PDE. A common
characteristic in the reduction of both cases is that the Lie symmetry
which is used for the reduction is not admitted as such by the reduced
DE, it is ”lost”.

It has been found that the reduced equation is possible to admit more
Lie symmetries than the original equation. These new Lie symmetries have
been termed Type II hidden symmetries. Also, if one works in the reverse
way and either increases the order of an ODE or increases the number of
independent and dependent variables of a PDE, then, it is possible that
the new (the ‘augmented’) DE admits new point symmetries not admitted by
the original DE. This type of Lie symmetries are called Type I hidden
symmetries.

The Type I and Type II hidden symmetries have studied extensively in the
recent years by various authors (see e.g. [ 112 , 99 , 14 , 100 , 113 ,
114 , 115 ] ). In the following sections, we consider mainly the Type
II hidden symmetries as they are the ones which could be used to reduce
further the reduced DE.

The origin of Type II hidden symmetries is different for the ODEs and
the PDEs, although it has been shown recently that they are nearly the
same [ 116 ] . For the case of ODEs, the inheritance or not of a Lie
symmetry, the @xmath say, by the reduced ODE depends on the commutator
of that symmetry with the symmetry used for the reduction, the @xmath
say. For example, if only two Lie symmetries @xmath are admitted by the
original equation and the commutator @xmath where @xmath may be
zero, then reduction by @xmath results in @xmath being a nonlocal
symmetry for the reduced ODE while reduction by @xmath results in @xmath
being an inherited Lie symmetry of the reduced ODE. In the reduction by
@xmath the symmetry @xmath is a Type I hidden symmetry of the original
equation relative to the reduced equation. In the case of more than two
Lie symmetries the situation is the same, if the Lie bracket gives a
third Lie symmetry, the @xmath say. Then, the point like nature of a
symmetry is preserved only if reduction is performed using the normal
subgroup  and @xmath has a certain expression [ 117 ] .

The above scenario is transferred to PDEs as follows. The reduced PDE
loses the symmetry used to reduce the number of variables and it may
lose other Lie symmetries depending on the structure of the associated
Lie algebra depending if the admitted subgroup is normal or not [ 117 ]
. Similarly, if @xmath are Lie symmetries of the original PDE with
commutator @xmath where @xmath may be zero, then reduction by @xmath
results in @xmath being a symmetry of the reduced PDE while reduction by
@xmath results in an expression which has no relevance for the PDE [ 117
] .

In addition to that scenario, B. Abraham - Shrauner and K.S. Govinder
have proposed a new potential source for the Type II hidden symmetries [
118 ] based on the observation that different PDEs with the same
variables, which admit different Lie symmetry algebras, may be reduced
to the same target PDE. Based on that observation, they propose that the
target PDE inherits Lie symmetries from all reduced PDEs, which explains
why some of the new symmetries are not admitted by the specific PDE used
for the reduction. In this context arises the problem of identifying the
set of all PDEs which lead to the same reduced PDE after reduction by a
Lie symmetry. In a recent paper [ 116 ] , it has been shown that this is
also the case with the ODEs; that is, it is shown that different
differential equations which can be reduced to the same equation provide
point sources for each of the Lie symmetries of the reduced equation
even though any particular of the higher order equations may not provide
the full complement of Lie symmetries. Therefore, concerning the ODEs
the Lie symmetries of the reduced equation can be viewed as having two
sources. Firstly, the point and nonlocal symmetries of a given higher
order equation and secondly, the point symmetries of a variety of higher
order ODEs. Finally, in a newer paper [ 118 ] , it has been shown by a
counter example that Type II hidden symmetries for PDEs can have a
nonpoint origin, i.e. they arise from contact symmetries or even
nonlocal symmetries of the original equation. Other approaches may be
found in [ 119 ] .

In the present Chapter we will study the reduction and the consequent
existence of Type II hidden symmetries of the homogeneous heat equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the Laplace equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

in certain classes of Riemannian spaces, where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is the Laplace operator. In a general Riemannian space, the homogeneous
heat equation ( 8.1 ) admits three Lie point symmetries and the Laplace
equation ( 8.2 ) admits two Lie point symmetries, which are not useful
for reduction. This implies that if we wish to find ‘sound’ reductions
of equations ( 8.1 ) and ( 8.2 ), we have to consider Riemannian spaces
which admit some type of symmetry(ies) of the metric (these symmetries
are not Lie symmetries and are called collineations). Indeed, as it has
been shown in Chapter 6 , the Lie symmetries of the homogeneous heat and
the Laplace equation in a Riemannian space are generated from the
elements of the homothetic algebra and the conformal algebra of the
space respectively. Thus, one expects that in spaces with a nonvoid
conformal algebra there will be Lie symmetry vectors which will allow
for the reduction of equations ( 8.1 ), ( 8.2 ) and the possibility of
the existence of Type II hidden symmetries.

In section 8.3 we reduce the Laplace equation with the extra Lie
symmetries existing in (a) a decomposable space - that is a Riemannian
space which admits a gradient Killing vector (KV) - (b) in a space which
admits a gradient Homothetic vector (HV) and (c) in a space which admits
a special Conformal killing vector (sp.CKV). In section 8.4 , we apply
the results of the previous section and find the Type II symmetries of
the Laplace equation in four and three dimensional Minkowski spacetimes.
Also we fully recover previous results [ 100 ] . In order to study the
reduction of Laplace equation by a non-gradient HV and a proper CKV we
consider two further examples. In section 8.5 , we consider the
algebraically special vacuum solution of Einstein’s equations known as
Petrov type III [ 120 ] and we make the reduction using the Lie point
symmetry generated by the nongradient HV. Moreover we do the same in a
conformally flat spacetime where the proper CKVs generate Lie
symmetries.

In section 8.6 , we reduce the homogeneous heat equation ( 8.1 ) with
the extra Lie symmetries existing (i) in a space which admits a gradient
KV and (ii) in a space which admits a gradient HV. In section 8.7 , we
consider the special cases of  the previous section, that is, a
decomposable space whose nondecomposable part is a maximally symmetric
space of non-vanishing curvature and the spatially flat Friedmann
Robertson Walker (FRW) space time used in Cosmology. Finally in section
8.8 we consider the reduction of the homogeneous heat equation in the
Petrov type III spacetime using the Lie symmetry which is generated by
the HV.

We emphasize that all results are derived in a purely geometric manner
without the use of a computer package. However, we have verified them
with the libraries PDEtools and SADE [ 121 , 104 ] of Maple ¹ ¹ 1

#### 8.2 Lie symmetries of Laplace equation in certain Riemannian spaces

In a general Riemannian space, Laplace equation ( 8.2 ) admits the Lie
symmetries

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is a solution of Laplace equation. These symmetries are too
general to provide useful reductions and lead to reduced PDEs which
posses Type II hidden symmetries. However if we restrict our
considerations to spaces which admit a conformal algebra (proper or not)
then we will have new Lie symmetries, hence new reductions of Laplace
equation eqn ( 8.2 ), which might lead to Type II hidden symmetries.

In the following sections, we consider spaces in which the metric @xmath
can be written in a generic form. The spaces we shall consider are: a.
Spaces which admit a gradient KV (decomposable spaces)  b. Spaces which
admit a gradient HV and c. Spaces which admit a sp.CKV.

The generic form of the metric for each type is as follows ( @xmath ):

1.  If a @xmath dimensional Riemannian space admits a gradient KV, the
    @xmath say, then the space is decomposable along @xmath and the
    metric is written as (see e.g. [ 44 ] )

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

2.  If a @xmath dimensional Riemannian space admits a gradient HV, the
    @xmath say, then the metric can be written in the generic form [ 83
    ]

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

3.  If a @xmath dimensional Riemannian space admits a sp.CKV then admits
    a gradient KV and a gradient HV [ 83 , 22 ] and the metric can be
    written in the generic form

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    while the sp.CKV is @xmath with conformal factor @xmath .

The Riemannian spaces which admit non-gradient proper HV do not have a
generic form for their metric. However, the spaces for which the HV acts
simply transitively are a few and are given together with their
homothetic algebra in [ 120 ] . A special class of these spaces are the
algebraically special vacuum space-times known as Petrov type N, II ,
III, D. In section 8.5.1 , we shall consider the reduction of Laplace
equation in the Petrov type III spacetime whose metric is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with the symmetry generated by the non-gradient HV @xmath The reduction
of Laplace equation in the rest of the Petrov types is similar both in
the working method and results and there is no need to consider them
explicitly.

Finally we shall consider the conformally flat space

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which admits a proper CKV which produces a Lie symmetry ² ² 2 According
to theorem 6.4.2 , the condition for this is that the conformal factor
satisfies Laplace equation and we reduce Laplace equation using this
symmetry.

In what follows all spaces are assumed to be of dimension @xmath .

#### 8.3 Reduction of the Laplace equation in certain Riemannian spaces

As we have seen in Chapter 6 , the Lie symmetries of Laplace equation (
8.2 ) in a Riemannian space are generated from the CKVs (not necessarily
proper) whose conformal factor satisfies Laplace equation. This
condition is satisfied trivially by the KVs ( @xmath the HV ( @xmath and
the sp.CKVs ( @xmath Therefore these vectors (which span a subalgebra of
the conformal group) are among the Lie symmetries of Laplace equation.
Concerning the proper CKVs it is not necessary that their conformal
factor satisfies the Laplace equation, therefore they may not produce
Lie symmetries for Laplace equation.

##### 8.3.1 Riemannian spaces admitting a gradient KV

Without loss of generality we assume the gradient KV to be the @xmath so
that the metric has the generic form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath @xmath is the metric of the @xmath dimensional space. For
the metric ( 8.3 ) Laplace equation ( 8.2 ) takes the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

and admits as extra Lie symmetry the gradient KV @xmath

We reduce ( 8.4 ) by using the zeroth order invariants @xmath of the
extra Lie symmetry @xmath . Taking these invariants as new coordinates,
equation ( 8.4 ) reduces to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is Laplace equation in the @xmath dimensional space with metric
@xmath Now we recall the result that the conformal algebra of the @xmath
metric @xmath and the @xmath metric ( 8.3 ) are related as follows [ 44
] :

a. The KVs of the @xmath metric are identical with those of the @xmath
metric

b. The @xmath metric admits a HV if and only if the @xmath metric admits
one and if @xmath is the HV of the @xmath metric then the HV of the
@xmath metric is given by the expression

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

d. The @xmath metric admits CKVs if and only if the @xmath metric @xmath
admits a gradient CKV (for details see [ 44 ] ).

Therefore Type II hidden symmetries for ( 8.2 ) exist if the @xmath
metric @xmath admits more symmetries. Specifically, the sp.CKVs of the
@xmath metric as well as the proper CKVs whose conformal function is a
solution of Laplace equation ( 8.62 ) generate Type II hidden
symmetries.

##### 8.3.2 Riemannian spaces admitting a gradient HV.

In Riemannian spaces which admit a gradient HV, @xmath say, there exists
a coordinate system in which the metric is written in the form [ 83 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the gradient HV is @xmath In these coordinates the Laplacian ( 8.2 )
takes the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

and admits the extra Lie symmetry (see Theorem 6.4.2 ) @xmath . We
reduce ( 8.8 ) using @xmath

The zeroth order invariants of @xmath are @xmath and using them it
follows easily that the reduced equation is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

that is, the Laplacian defined by the metric @xmath .

It is easy to establish the following results concerning the conformal
algebras of the metrics ( 8.7 ) and @xmath .
1. The KVs of @xmath are also KVs of ( 8.7 ).
2. The HV of ( 8.7 ) is independent from that of @xmath .
3. The metric ( 8.7 ) admits proper CKVs if and only if the @xmath
metric @xmath admits gradient CKVs. This is because ( 8.7 ) is
conformally related with the decomposable metric

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

The above imply, that Type II hidden symmetries we shall have from the
HV of the metric @xmath the sp.CKVs and finally from the proper CKVs of
@xmath whose conformal factor is a solution of Laplace equation ( 8.9 ).

##### 8.3.3 Riemannian spaces admitting a sp.CKV

It is known [ 22 ] , that if an @xmath dimensional ( @xmath Riemannian
space admits sp.CKVs then also admits a gradient HV and as many gradient
KVs as the number of sp.CKVs. In these spaces there exists always a
coordinate system in which the metric is written in the form [ 83 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the gradient KV and @xmath is the gradient HV. @xmath is
an @xmath dimensional metric. For a general @xmath dimensional metric
@xmath the @xmath dimensional metric ( 8.11 ) admits the following
special Conformal group

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where @xmath is a gradient KV, @xmath is a gradient HV and @xmath is a
sp.CKV with conformal factor @xmath . In these coordinates Laplace
equation ( 8.2 ) takes the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

From Theorem 6.4.2 , we have that the extra Lie symmetries of ( 8.12 )
are the vectors

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where @xmath and the non zero commutators are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We consider the reduction of ( 8.12 ) with each of the extra Lie
symmetries.

###### Reduction with the gradient KV @xmath.

The first order invariants of @xmath are @xmath , @xmath and by using
them we reduce the Laplacian ( 8.12 ) to ( 8.8 ) which admits the Lie
symmetry @xmath generated by the HV. This result is expected because
@xmath [ 100 ] hence the Lie symmetry @xmath is inherited. Therefore, in
this reduction the Type II symmetries are generated from the CKVs of the
metric ( 8.7 ). It is possible to continue the reduction by the gradient
HV @xmath and then we find the results of section 8.3.2 .

###### Reduction with the gradient HV @xmath.

The reduction with a gradient HV has been studied in section 8.3.2 . To
apply the results of section 8.3.2 in the present case we have to bring
the metric ( 8.11 ) to the form ( 8.7 ). For this we consider the
transformation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which brings ( 8.11 ) to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

so that the metric @xmath of  ( 8.7 ) is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

The reduced equation of ( 8.12 ) under the Lie symmetry generated by the
gradient HV is Laplace equation in the space ( 8.14 ). For this
reduction we do not have inherited symmetries and there exist Type II
hidden symmetries as stated in section 8.3.2 .

###### Reduction with the sp.CKV @xmath.

Before we reduce ( 8.12 ) with the symmetry generated by the sp CKV
@xmath , it is best to write the metric ( 8.11 ) in new coordinates. We
introduce the new variable @xmath via the relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the new variables the metric ( 8.11 ) becomes

  -- -- -- --------
           (8.16)
  -- -- -- --------

the Laplacian ( 8.12 ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

and the Lie symmetry @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The zeroth order invariants of @xmath are @xmath We choose @xmath to be
the independent variables and @xmath the dependent one. By replacing in
( 8.3.3 ) we find the reduced equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

We consider cases.
The case @xmath @xmath

If @xmath then ( 8.18 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath is the Laplace operator for the metric

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

Equation ( 8.19 ) is the Klein Gordon equation in a space with potential
@xmath and metric ( 8.20 ). Considering the new transformation @xmath or
@xmath the metric ( 8.20 ) is written

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath whereas the potential @xmath which is the well known
Ermakov potential [ 69 ] .

This means that the gradient HV @xmath , is a Lie symmetry of ( 8.19 )
which is the Lie symmetry @xmath Therefore, if the metric @xmath admits
proper CKVs which satisfy the conditions of Theorem 7.3.3 , then these
vectors generate Type II hidden symmetries of ( 8.12 ).
The case @xmath

If @xmath then @xmath and @xmath is a two dimensional metric. In this
case, equation ( 8.18 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

or, by multiplying with @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is the Laplacian in the three dimensional space with metric

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

By making the new transformation @xmath ( 8.23 ) is of the form ( 8.7 )
and admits the gradient HV @xmath which gives an inherited symmetry. We
conclude that Type II hidden symmetries of ( 8.24 ) will be generated
from the proper CKVs of the metric ( 8.24 ) which satisfy the condition
of Theorem 6.4.2 .
The case @xmath @xmath

For @xmath @xmath is a one dimensional metric and ( 8.11 ) is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is a flat metric ³ ³ 3 The only three dimensional space who admits
sp.CKV is the flat space, because in that case we also have a gradient
HV and a gradient KV. . In this space, Laplace equation ( 8.12 ) admits
ten Lie point symmetries, as many as the elements of the Conformal
algebra of the flat 3D space. Six of these vectors are KVs, one vector
is a gradient HV and three are sp.CKVs (see example 2.7.12 ). We reduce
the Laplace equation with the symmetry @xmath and the reduced equation
is ( 8.18 ) which for @xmath becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

Equation ( 8.26 ) is in the form of ( 6.13 ) (see Chapter 6 ) with
@xmath and @xmath By replacing in the symmetry conditions ( 6.21 )-(
6.25 ) we find the Lie symmetries

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath are the CKVs of the two dimensional space with metric
@xmath . In this case, all proper CKVs of the two dimensional space
@xmath generate Type II Lie symmetries. Recall that the conformal
algebra of a two dimensional space is infinite dimensional.

#### 8.4 Type II hidden symmetries of the 3D and the 4D wave equation

In this section we apply the general results of the previous section to
specific spaces where the metric is known.

##### 8.4.1 Laplacian in @xmath

The Laplace equation in the four dimensional Minkowski spacetime @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

is the wave equation [ 100 ] in @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

The conformal algebra of the metric ( 8.27 ) is generated by 15 vectors
(see example 2.7.12 ). From theorem 6.4.2 we have that the extra Lie
point symmetries of ( 8.28 ) are the vectors

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath

The nonzero commutators are

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

###### Reduction with a gradient KV

We choose to make reduction of ( 8.28 ) with the gradient KV @xmath .
The reduced equation is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is Laplace equation in the space @xmath The extra Lie symmetries
of ( 8.30 ) are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

and are inherited symmetries (see also the last commutators). The Type
II symmetries are the vectors

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

that is the Type II hidden symmetries are generated from the sp.CKVs of
@xmath .

###### Reduction with the gradient HV

In this case it is better to switch to hyperspherical coordinates @xmath

In these coordinates the metric ( 8.27 ) is written

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the wave equation ( 8.28 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

According to the analysis of section 8.3.2 the reduced equation is ( 8.9
) which is the Laplacian in the three dimensional space of the variables
@xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

This space is a space of constant curvature. The conformal algebra ⁴ ⁴ 4
All spaces of constant curvature are conformally flat, hence, they admit
the same conformal algebra with the flat space but not the same
subalgebras, i.e. the same conformal factors. of a 3D space of constant
non-vanishing curvature consists of 6 non-gradient KVs and 4 proper CKVs
⁵ ⁵ 5 The rotations and the sp.CKVs of the flat space are KVs for the
space of constant curvature, the rest are proper gradient CKVs [ 23 ] .
The conformal factors of the CKVs do not satisfy the condition @xmath
(see Theorem 6.4.2 ); hence, they do not generate Lie point symmetries
for the reduced equation ( 8.35 ) whereas for the same reason the KVs
are Lie symmetries of ( 8.35 ). Therefore, all point Lie point
symmetries are inherited and we do not have Type II hidden symmetries.

We note that the proper CKVs in a space of constant non-vanishing
curvature are gradient and their conformal factor satisfies the relation
[ 23 ]

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which implies that they are Lie symmetries of the conformally invariant
operator but not of the Laplace equation ( 8.35 ).

###### Reduction with a sp.CKV

Following the steps of section 8.3.3 , we consider the transformation to
axi-symmetric coordinates @xmath in which ( 8.28 ) takes the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

Applying the transformation ( 8.15 ) @xmath we find (note that this is
the case @xmath ) that ( 8.36 ) is written as ( 8.3.3 ) and the reduced
equation is the Laplacian @xmath for the 3D metric

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

The metric ( 8.37 ) under the coordinate transformation @xmath is
written

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is the flat 3D Lorentzian metric, which does not admit proper
CKVs. This implies that the Lie symmetries of the reduced equation are
generated from the KVs/HV/sp.CKVs of the flat @xmath metric and all are
inherited. Therefore we do not have Type II hidden symmetries for the
reduction with a sp.CKV.

As we shall show in the next section this is not the case for the
reduction of Laplace equation in @xmath

##### 8.4.2 Laplacian in @xmath

We consider the reduction of Laplace equation in the 3d Minkowski @xmath
spacetime [ 100 ] , i.e. the wave equation in @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

As we have seen in section 8.4.1 the extra Lie point symmetries of (
8.39 ) are the ten vectors ( 8.31 ) and ( 8.32 ).

###### Reduction with a gradient KV

We choose the vector @xmath and the reduction gives the reduced equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is the one dimensional wave equation. The 2d space @xmath has an
infinite number of CKVs therefore ( 8.40 ) has infinite Lie point
symmetries [ 1 ] . From these symmetries the KVs and the HV are
inherited symmetries and the CKVs are Type II symmetries.

###### Reduction with the gradient HV

In order to do the reduction with the gradient HV we introduce spherical
coordinates @xmath and find that ( 8.39 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

According to the results of section 8.3.2 the reduced equation is
equation ( 8.9 ) which is the Laplace equation in the 2d space of the
variables @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

By making the transformation @xmath equation ( 8.42 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is the wave equation ( 8.40 ) with @xmath .

We obtain the results, concerning the Lie symmetries of ( 8.43 ) from
section 8.4.2 with the difference that the Lie symmetry due to the HV of
the two dimensional metric is not inherited but it is a Type II hidden
symmetry.

The reduction of the wave equation in the 4D and in 3D Minkowski space
has been done previously by Abraham-Shrauner et. all [ 100 ] and our
results coincide with theirs. For example in the 3d case equation (17)
of [ 100 ] is our equation ( 8.42 ) in other variables. However there
are two differences (a) in the case of the 2D space they do not obtain
that the Lie symmetries are infinite and (b) they use algebraic
computing programs to find the Lie symmetry generators whereas our
approach is geometric and general and does not need algebraic computing
programs to find the complete answer.

The reduction with a sp.CKV has been considered in section 8.3.3 .

#### 8.5 The Laplace equation in the Petrov type III and in the FRW-like
spacetime

To complete our analysis, we have to reduce the Laplace equation using a
non gradient homothetic vector and a proper (i.e. non special) CKV. In
order to do this, we consider the reduction of Laplace equation in the
Petrov type III spacetime and in the FRW-like spacetime.

##### 8.5.1 The Laplace equation in the Petrov Type III spacetime

In this section we consider the reduction of Laplace equation in spaces
which do not admit gradient KVs or a gradient HV. As it has been
mentioned in section 8.2 we shall consider the algebraically special
solutions of Einstein equations, that is the Petrov type D,N,II and III.
In fact we restrict our discussion to Petrov Type III because both the
method of work and the results are the same for all Petrov types.

The metric of the Petrov type III space-time is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

with conformal algebra

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where @xmath are KVs and @xmath is a non-gradient HV. (The space does
not admit proper CKVs).

In this space-time Laplace equation ( 8.2 ) takes the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

From Theorem 6.4.2 we have that the extra Lie point symmetries are the
vectors

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with nonzero commutators:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We use @xmath to reduce the PDE because this is the Lie symmetry
generated by the nongradient HV .

The zero order invariants of @xmath are @xmath . We choose @xmath as the
independent variables and @xmath as the dependent variable and we find
the reduced equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

Equation ( 8.46 ) can be written

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the Laplacian for the metric

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Lie symmetries of ( 8.47 ) will be generated from the conformal
algebra of ( 8.48 ) with some extra conditions (see equations ( 6.21 )-(
6.25 )). Finally, we find that equation ( 8.47 ) admits as Lie point
symmetries the vectors @xmath which are inherited symmetries. Therefore
we do not have Type II hidden symmetries.

##### 8.5.2 The Laplace equation in the @xmathdimensional FRW-like
spacetime.

We consider the @xmath dimensional FRW-like space @xmath with metric

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the @xmath dimensional Euclidian metric. The reduction
of Laplace equation in this space (for @xmath ) has been studied
previously in [ 122 ] . The metric ( 8.49 ) is conformally flat hence
admits the same CKVs with the flat space but with different subalgebras.
More precisely the space admits

a. @xmath KVs the @xmath

b. @xmath gradient HV @xmath the @xmath
the rest vectors being proper CKVs [ 45 ] . In this space Laplace
equation ( 8.2 ) becomes

  -- -- -- --------
           (8.50)
  -- -- -- --------

and the extra Lie symmetries are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath .  The algebra of the Lie point symmetries is the same with
that of section 7.55 . We consider the reduction with a proper CKV.

###### Reduction with a proper CKV

We may take any of the vectors @xmath (because as one can see in the
Appendix there is a symmetry between the coordinates @xmath ). We choose
the vector

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

whose zero order invariants are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We take the dependent variable to be the @xmath and find the reduced
equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . We consider cases.
Case @xmath

For @xmath equation ( 8.51 ) is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the Laplace operator for the @xmath dimensional metric

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

and @xmath . The metric ( 8.53 ) is conformally flat hence we know its
conformal algebra. Application of theorem 7.3.3 gives that the Lie point
symmetries of ( 8.52 ) are the vectors

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

These are inherited symmetries (this result agrees with the
commutators). We conclude that for this reduction we do not have Type II
hidden symmetries.

Case @xmath @xmath

For @xmath the reduced equation is a two dimensional equation @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

and admits as Lie point symmetry the KV @xmath which is an inherited
symmetry. Hence, we do not have Type II hidden symmetries.

We conclude that the reduction of Laplace equation in an @xmath
dimensional FRW like space with the proper CKV does not produce Type II
hidden symmetries and in fact the inherited symmetries of the reduced
equation are the KVs of the flat metric.

###### Reduction with the gradient HV

The gradient HV @xmath is a Lie symmetry of the Laplacian ( 8.50 ) hence
we consider the reduction by this vector. The zero order invariants are
@xmath and lead to the reduced equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is Laplace equation in the flat space @xmath . We consider again
cases.
Case @xmath

In this case the Lie symmetries of ( 8.55 ) are given by the vectors

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

From these the @xmath are inherited symmetries and the rest - which are
produced by the HV and the sp.CKVs of the space @xmath - are Type II
hidden symmetries.

If @xmath the reduced equation ( 8.55 ) is the Laplacian in @xmath
hence, admits infinite Lie symmetries. Type II hidden symmetries are
generated from the HV and the CKVs of @xmath .

In the following sections, we study the reduction of the homogeneous
heat equation ( 8.1 ) in certain Riemannian spaces.

#### 8.6 Reduction of the homogeneous heat equation in certain
Riemannian spaces

In a general Riemannian space with metric @xmath the heat conduction
equation with flux is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the Laplace operator @xmath and @xmath . Equation ( 8.57
) can also be written

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are the Christofell Symbols of the metric @xmath
.

For @xmath , equation ( 8.58 ) admits the Lie point symmetries

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a solution of the heat equation. These symmetries are
too general to provide sound reductions and consequently reduced PDEs
which can give Type II hidden symmetries. However, in Chapter 6 it has
been shown that there is a close relation between the Lie point
symmetries of the heat equation and the collineations of the metric.
Specifically it has been shown that the Lie point symmetries of the heat
equation are generated from the HV and the KVs of @xmath This implies
that if we want to have new Lie point  symmetries which will allow for
sound reductions of the heat equation eqn ( 8.58 ) we have to restrict
our considerations to spaces which admit a homothetic algebra. Our
intention is to keep the discussion as general as possible therefore we
consider spaces in which the metric @xmath can be written in generic
form. The spaces we shall consider are:

a. Spaces which admit a gradient KV ( 8.3 ).

b. Spaces which admit a gradient HV ( 8.7 ).

c. Space which admits a nongradient HV acting simply transitive, i.e.
Petrov Type III ( 8.44 ).

In what follows all spaces are of dimension @xmath . The case @xmath
although relatively trivial for our approach in general it is not so and
has been studied for example in [ 123 , 124 ] .

##### 8.6.1 The heat equation in a space which admits a gradient KV

In the @xmath decomposable space with line element ( 8.3 ) the heat
equation ( 8.1 ) takes the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

Application of Theorem 6.5.2 gives that ( 8.60 ) admits the following
extra Lie point symmetries generated by the gradient KV @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with nonvanishing commutators

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

We reduce ( 8.60 ) using the zero order invariants of the extra Lie
point  symmetries @xmath .

###### Reduction by @xmath

The zero order invariants of @xmath are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Taking these invariants as new coordinates eqn ( 8.60 ) reduces to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.62)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the Laplace operator in the @xmath dimensional space
with metric @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.63)
  -- -------- -- --------

Equation ( 8.62 ) is the homogeneous heat eqn ( 8.1 ) in the @xmath
dimensional space with metric @xmath .  According to the Theorem 6.5.2
(see Chapter 6 ), the Lie symmetries of this equation are the homothetic
algebra of @xmath . As it has been already mentioned the homothetic
algebras of the @xmath and the @xmath metrics are related as follows [
44 ] :

a. The KVs of the @xmath metric are identical with those of the @xmath
metric.

b. The @xmath metric admits a HV if the @xmath metric admits one and if
@xmath is the HV of the @xmath - metric then the HV of the @xmath metric
is given by the expression

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

The above imply that equation ( 8.62 ) inherits all symmetries which are
generated from the KVs/HV of the @xmath metric @xmath Hence we do not
have Type II symmetries in this reduction.

###### Reduction by @xmath

The zero order invariants of @xmath are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Taking these invariants as new coordinates eqn ( 8.60 ) reduces to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.65)
  -- -------- -- --------

or

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This is the nonhomogeneous heat equation with flux @xmath . Application
of Theorem 6.5.1 gives the following result ⁶ ⁶ 6 For details see
Appendix 8.A . .

###### Proposition 8.6.1

The Lie point symmetries of the heat equation ( 8.65 ) in an @xmath
dimensional Riemannian space with metric @xmath are constructed form the
homothetic algebra of the metric as follows:

a. @xmath is a HV/KV.
The Lie symmetry is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

b. @xmath is a gradient HV/KV (the index @xmath counts gradient KVs).
The Lie symmetry is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a solution of the heat equation ( 8.65 ).

We infer that for this reduction we have the Type II hidden symmetry
@xmath The rest of the Lie point symmetries are inherited.

##### 8.6.2 The heat equation in a space which admits a gradient
homothetic vector

For the spacetime with line element

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

the homogeneous heat equation becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.68)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are the connection coefficients of the
Riemannian metric @xmath ( @xmath Application of Theorem 6.5.2 gives
that the heat equation ( 8.68 ) admits the following extra Lie point
symmetries generated by the gradient homothetic vector

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.69)
  -- -------- -- --------

with nonzero commutators

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We consider again the reduction of ( 8.68 ) using the zero order
invariants of these extra Lie point symmetries.

###### Reduction by @xmath

The zero order invariants of @xmath are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We choose @xmath as the dependent variable.

Replacing in ( 8.68 ) we find the reduced PDE

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.70)
  -- -------- -- --------

Consider a nonvanishing function @xmath and divide ( 8.70 ) with @xmath
to get:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.71)
  -- -------- -- --------

It follows that  (for @xmath ) equation ( 8.71 ) can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.72)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath @xmath is the Laplace operator if @xmath and @xmath is the
conformally related metric

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.73)
  -- -------- -- --------

According to Theorem 6.4.2 the Lie point symmetries of ( 8.72 ) are the
CKVs of the metric ( 8.73 )  whose conformal factor satisfies the
condition @xmath Therefore, Type II hidden symmetries will be generated
from the proper CKVs. The existence and the number of these vectors
depends mainly on the @xmath metric @xmath

###### Reduction by @xmath

For @xmath the zero order invariants are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We choose @xmath as the dependent variable and we have the reduced
equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.74)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.75)
  -- -------- -- --------

Equation ( 8.74 ) is the Laplace equation in the space @xmath with
metric

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.76)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Lie point symmetries of Laplace equation ( 8.74 ) are given in
Theorem 6.4.2 . As in the last case the existence and the number of
these vectors depends mainly on the @xmath metric @xmath

We note that both vectors @xmath are generated form the gradient HV and
in both cases the heat equation is reduced to Laplace equation. This
gives the following

###### Proposition 8.6.2

The reduction of the heat equation ( 8.1 ) in a space with metric ( 8.7
) @xmath by means of the Lie symmetries generated by the gradient HV
leads to Laplace equation @xmath , where @xmath is the Laplace operator
for the metric ( 8.73 ) if the reduction is done by @xmath and for the
metric ( 8.76 ) if the reduction is done by @xmath .

#### 8.7 Applications of the reduction of the homogeneous heat equation

In this section, we consider applications of the general results of
section 8.6 in various spacetimes.

##### 8.7.1 The heat equation in a @xmath decomposable space

Consider the @xmath decomposable space

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.77)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath that is, the @xmath space is a space of constant non
vanishing ( @xmath curvature. The space ( 8.77 )  does not admit proper
HV, however, admits @xmath nongradient KVs and @xmath gradient KV as
follows [ 44 ]

  -- -------- -- -------- --
     @xmath      @xmath   
     @xmath      @xmath   
     @xmath      @xmath   
  -- -------- -- -------- --

In a space with metric ( 8.77 ), the homogeneous heat equation takes the
form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.78)
  -- -------- -- --------

Applying Theorem 6.5.2 we find that equation ( 8.78 ) admits the extra
Lie point  symmetries

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.79)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Lie point  symmetries which are generated by the gradient KV are ⁷ ⁷
7 Here the algebra is the one given in section 8.6.1 and a separate
algebra is the algebra of the KVs of the space of constant curvature.
More specifically the KVs @xmath commute with all other symmetries but
not between themselves @xmath .

Reduction of ( 8.78 ) by means of the gradient KV @xmath results in the
special form of equation ( 8.62 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.80)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is the homogeneous heat equation in an @xmath - dimensional space
of constant curvature. The Lie point  symmetries of this equation have
been determined in section 6.5.1 and are inherited symmetries. Hence, in
this case, we do not have Type II hidden symmetries.

Reduction of ( 8.78 ) with the Lie symmetry @xmath gives that the
reduced equation ( 8.65 ) is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.81)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is the heat equation with flux. By Proposition 8.6.1 , the Lie
point  symmetries of ( 8.81 ) are:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.82)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are constants. From section 8.6.1 we have that Type II
hidden symmetry is the one defined by the constant @xmath .

##### 8.7.2 FRW space-time with a gradient HV

Consider the spatially flat FRW metric

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.83)
  -- -------- -- --------

This metric admits the gradient HV [ 45 ]

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and six nongradient KVs

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath

In this space the heat equation takes the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.84)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Lie point symmetries of ( 8.84 ) are

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
                       @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The Lie point  symmetries @xmath are produced by the gradient HV
therefore we use them to reduce ( 8.84 ). We note that this case is a
special case of the one we considered in section 8.6.2 for @xmath .

Reduction by @xmath gives that ( 8.84 ) becomes:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.85)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath This is a special form of ( 8.70 ).

Dividing with @xmath we find that ( 8.85 ) is written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.86)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the metric @xmath is the conformally related metric of  ( 8.83 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.87)
  -- -------- -- --------

We have that the Lie symmetries of ( 8.86 ) are generated from elements
of the conformal algebra of the space whose conformal factors satisfy
condition @xmath The metric ( 8.86 ) is conformally flat therefore its
conformal group is the same with that of the flat space [ 44 , 45 ] ,
however with different subgroups. We find that these vectors (i.e. the
Lie symmetries) are the vectors

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.88)
  -- -------- -- --------

We conclude that there are no Type II symmetries for this reduction.

Using reduction by @xmath we find that ( 8.84 ) reduces to :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.89)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath This is a special form of ( 8.74 ) which is the Laplace
equation. In this case the results of [ 90 ] apply and we infer that the
Lie point  symmetries of ( 8.89 ) are:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
                       @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.90)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The vector @xmath is the proper HV of the metric and the vectors @xmath
the proper CKVs which are not special CKVs, therefore these vectors are
Type II hidden symmetries. A further analysis of ( 8.89 ) can be found
in [ 122 ] .

#### 8.8 The Heat equation in Petrov type III spacetime

In this section we consider the special class of Petrov type III
spacetime which admits a nongradient HV which acts simply transitively.

The metric of the Petrov type III space-time is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.91)
  -- -------- -- --------

with Homothetic algebra

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where @xmath are KVs and @xmath is a nongradient HV.

In this space-time equation ( 8.1 ) takes the form:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.92)
  -- -------- -- --------

From Theorem 6.5.2 we have that the extra Lie point  symmetries are the
vectors

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with nonzero commutators:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We use @xmath for reduction because this is the Lie point symmetry
generated by the HV.

The zero order invariants of @xmath are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We choose @xmath as the dependent variable and we find that the reduced
PDE is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.93)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the Laplace operator for metric ( 8.91 ).

It is clear that the second order PDE ( 8.93 ) admits only the Lie
symmetries @xmath Therefore, we do not have Type II hidden symmetries
and the symmetries @xmath are Type I hidden symmetries.

#### 8.9 Conclusion

Up to now in the literature the study of Type II hidden symmetries has
been done by counter examples or by considering very special PDEs and in
low dimensional flat spaces. In this chapter we have improved this
scenario and have studied the problem of Type II hidden symmetries of
second order PDEs from a geometric of view in @xmath dimensional
Riemannian spaces. We have considered the reduction of the Laplace and
of the homogeneous heat equation and the consequent possibility of
existence of Type II hidden symmetries in some general classes of spaces
which admit some kind of symmetry; hence, they admit nontrivial Lie
symmetries .

For the Laplace equation, the conclusion of this study is that the Type
II hidden symmetries are directly related to the transition of the CKVs
from the space where the original equation is defined to the space where
the reduced equation resides. In this sense, we related the Lie point
symmetries of PDEs with the basic collineations of the metric i.e. the
CKVs.  Concerning the general results of the reduction of Laplace
equation we can summarize them as follows:

-   If we reduce the Laplace equation with a gradient KV the reduced
    equation is a Laplace equation in the non-decomposable space. In
    this case, the Type II hidden symmetries are generated from the
    special and the proper CKVs of the non-decomposable space.

-   If we reduce the Laplace equation with a gradient HV the reduced
    equation is a Laplace equation for an appropriate metric. In this
    case, the Type II hidden symmetries are generated from the HV and
    the special/proper CKVs.

-   If we reduce the Laplace equation with the symmetry generated by a
    sp.CKV, the reduced equation is the Klein Gordon equation for an
    appropriate metric that inherits the Lie point  symmetry generated
    by the gradient HV. In this case, the Type II hidden symmetries are
    generated from the proper CKVs.

We also considered the reduction of Laplace equation in some spaces of
interest in which the metric does not admit the symmetries of the
previous cases. In this context, we showed that the reduction with the
non-gradient HV in the Petrov type III does not give any Type II hidden
symmetries. Also, it is of interest the reduction of Laplace equation
(i.e. the wave equation) in Minkowski spaces @xmath and @xmath where we
recover the results of [ 100 ] in a straightforward manner without the
need of  computer software. Finally we considered an @xmath dimensional
flat FRW like space and showed that the reduction with the proper CKV
does not produce Type II hidden symmetries.

Moreover, we applied the zero order invariants of the Lie symmetries in
order to reduce the number of independent variables of the homogeneous
heat equation in certain general classes of Riemannian spaces, which
admit some type of basic symmetry. For each reduction, we determined the
origin of Type II hidden symmetries. The spaces we considered are the
spaces which admit a gradient KV, a gradient HV and finally spacetimes
which admits a HV which acts simply and transitively. For the reduction
of the homogeneous heat equation and the existence of Type II hidden
symmetries, we found the following general geometric results:

-   If we reduce the homogeneous heat equation via the symmetries which
    are generated by a gradient KV @xmath the reduced equation is a heat
    equation in the nondecomposable space. In this case we have the Type
    II hidden symmetry @xmath provided we reduce the heat equation with
    the symmetry @xmath .

-   If we reduce the homogeneous heat equation via the symmetries which
    are generated by a gradient HV the reduced equation is Laplace
    equation for an appropriate metric. In this case the Type II hidden
    symmetries are generated from the proper CKVs.

-   In Petrov type III spacetime, the reduction of the homogeneous heat
    equation via the symmetry generated from the nongradient HV gives a
    PDE which inherits the Lie point  symmetries, hence no Type II
    hidden symmetries are admitted.

The above results can be used in many important space-times and help
facilitate the solution of the heat equation in these space-times.

### Appendix 8.A Proof of Corollary

Proof of Corollary 8.6.1 . Using Theorem 6.5.1 and replacing @xmath we
have

For case a)

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.94)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.95)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.96)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

that is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.97)
  -- -------- -- --------

For case b)

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

then

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.98)
  -- -------- -- --------

from here we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.99)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

### Appendix 8.B The homogeneous heat equation in the Petrov spacetimes

In the following subsections, we study the reduction of the homogeneous
heat equation in the Petrov spacetimes of type N,D and II.

##### 8.b.1 Petrov type N

The metric of the Petrov type N space-time is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.100)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and has the homothetic algebra [ 120 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where @xmath are KVs and @xmath is a nongradient HV.

The heat equation ( 8.1 ) in this space-time is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.101)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Application of Theorem 6.5.2 gives that the extra Lie point symmetries
of ( 8.101 ) are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with nonzero commutators

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We use @xmath to reduce the PDE because this is the Lie symmetry
generated by the HV. The zero order invariants of @xmath are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.102)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Choosing @xmath as the independent variables and @xmath as the dependent
variable we find that the reduced PDE is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.103)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the Laplace operator for the metric ( 8.100 ).

Equation ( 8.103 ) is of the form ( 6.14 ) with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the metric ( 8.100 ). Replacing in equations ( 6.21 )-(
6.25 ) we obtain the Lie symmetry conditions for ( 8.103 ).  Because
@xmath it follows from equation ( 6.23 ) that the Lie point  symmetries
are generated from the CKVs of the metric ( 8.100 ). However taking into
consideration the rest of the symmetry conditions we find that the only
Lie symmetry which remains is the one of the KV @xmath We conclude that
in this reduction we do not have Type II hidden symmetries.

##### 8.b.2 Petrov type D

The metric of the Petrov type D space-time is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.104)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with Homothetic algebra

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where @xmath are KVs and @xmath is a nongradient HV.

In this space-time the heat equation ( 8.1 ) takes the form:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.105)
  -- -------- -- ---------

From Theorem 6.5.2 we have that the extra Lie point  symmetries are the
vectors

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with nonzero commutators:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

We use @xmath to reduce the PDE because this is the Lie symmetry
generated by the HV. The zero order invariants of @xmath are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We choose @xmath as the independent variables and @xmath as the
dependent variable and we find that the reduced PDE is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.106)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the Laplace operator with metric ( 8.104 ).

Working again with the Lie symmetry conditions ( 6.21 )-( 6.25 ) we find
that equation ( 8.106 ) admits as Lie point symmetry the vector @xmath
only which is an inherited symmetry. Hence we do not have Type II hidden
symmetries. Obviously the Lie point  symmetries @xmath are Type I hidden
symmetries for equation ( 8.106 ) for the reduction by @xmath

##### 8.b.3 Petrov type II

The metric of the Petrov type II space-time is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.107)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with homothetic algebra

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where @xmath are KVs and @xmath is a nongradient HV.

In this space-time equation ( 8.1 ) takes the form:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.108)
  -- -------- -- ---------

From Theorem 6.5.2 we have that the extra Lie point  symmetries are the
vectors

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with nonzero commutators:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

We use @xmath to reduce the PDE because this is the Lie symmetry
generated by the HV. The zero order invariants of @xmath are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We choose @xmath as the independent variables and @xmath as the
dependent variable and we find that the reduced PDE is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.109)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the Laplace operator for metric ( 8.107 ).

From the Lie symmetry conditions ( 6.21 )-( 6.25 ) it follows that (
8.109 ) does not admit any Lie point  symmetries. Hence, we do not have
Type II hidden symmetries in this case.

## Part IV Noether symmetries and theories of gravity

### Chapter 9 Noether symmetries in Scalar field Cosmology

#### 9.1 Introduction

The detailed analysis of the cosmological data indicate that the
Universe is spatially flat and has suffered two acceleration phases. An
early acceleration phase (inflation), which occurred prior to the
radiation-dominated era, and a recently initiated accelerated expansion
[ 125 , 126 , 127 , 128 , 129 , 130 , 131 ] . The source for the late
time cosmic acceleration has been attributed to an unidentified type of
matter, the dark energy. Dark energy contrary to the ordinary baryonic
matter has a negative pressure, i.e. a negative equation of state
parameter, which counteracts the gravitational force and leads to the
observed accelerated expansion.

The simplest dark energy probe is the cosmological constant leading to
the @xmath CDM cosmology [ 132 , 133 , 134 ] . However, it has been
shown that @xmath CDM cosmology suffers from two major drawbacks known
as the fine tuning problem and the coincidence problem [ 135 ] . Besides
@xmath CDM cosmology, many other candidates have been proposed in the
literature. Most are based either on the existence of new fields (i.e. a
scalar field) or in some modification of the Einstein Hilbert action
(see [ 136 ] ).

In addition to dark energy and the ordinary baryonic matter, it is
believed that the Universe contains a third type of matter, the dark
matter. This type of matter is assumed to be pressureless
(non-relativistic) and interacts very weakly with the standard baryonic
matter. Therefore, its presence is mainly inferred from gravitational
effects on visible matter.

In the following, we consider scalar field cosmology (minimally coupled
scalar field and non minimally coupled scalar field) and we propose a
geometric principle (‘selection rule’) for specifying the potential
@xmath and the coupling function @xmath of the scalar field in order to
solve analytically the system of the resulting field equations. We
propose that the scalar field model should be selected by the geometric
requirement that the dynamical system of the field equations admits
Noether point symmetries. The main reason for the consideration of this
hypothesis is that the Noether symmetries provide first integrals, which
assist the integrability of the system. Furthermore, as we saw in
chapter 4 the Noether symmetries are generated from the elements of the
homothetic algebra of the kinetic metric of the Lagrangian of the
theory. Therefore, with this assumption we let the theory to select the
potential, i.e. the dark energy model.

The idea to use Noether symmetries in cosmology, either on scalar field
models and on modified theories of gravity is not new and indeed a lot
of attention has been paid in the literature [ 137 , 138 , 107 , 139 ,
140 , 141 , 142 , 105 , 86 , 109 , 102 , 143 , 144 , 145 , 146 , 147 ,
148 , 149 ] . However our approach is geometric and more fundamental.

The structure of the present chapter is as follows. In sections 9.2 and
9.3 we discuss the conformal equivalence of Lagrangians for scalar
fields in a Riemannian space of dimension @xmath and @xmath
respectively. In particular we enunciate a theorem which proves that the
field equations for a non-minimally coupled scalar field are the same at
the conformal level with the field equations of the minimally coupled
scalar field. The necessity to preserve Einstein’s equations in the
context of Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) space-time leads us to
apply, in section 9.4 , the current general analysis to the scalar field
(quintessence or phantom) spatially flat FRWcosmologies.

In section 9.5 we apply the Noether symmetry approach in non minimally
coupled scalar field in a spatially flat FRW spacetime and by using the
Noether invariants we determine analytical solutions for the field
equations. Furthermore in sections 9.6 and 9.7 we apply the same
procedure for a minimally coupled scalar field in a spatially flat FRW
spacetime and in Bianchi Class A homogeneous spacetimes.

#### 9.2 Conformally equivalent Lagrangians and scalar field Cosmology

In this section we discuss the conformal equivalence of Lagrangians for
scalar fields in a general @xmath Riemannian space. The field equations
in the scalar field cosmology are derived from two different variational
principles. In the first case the scalar field @xmath and the
gravitational field are minimally coupled and the equations of motion
follow form the action

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the second case the scalar field @xmath (which is different from the
minimally coupled scalar field @xmath interacts with the gravitational
field (non minimal coupling) and the field equations follow from the
action

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the coupling function between the gravitational and the
scalar field @xmath . Below we state the following proposition.

###### Proposition 9.2.1

The field equations for a non minimally coupled scalar field @xmath with
Lagrangian @xmath and coupling function @xmath in the gravitational
field @xmath are the same with the field equations of the minimally
coupled scalar field @xmath for a conformal Lagrangian @xmath in the
conformal metric @xmath @xmath where the conformal function @xmath with
@xmath The inverse is also true, that is, to a minimally coupled scalar
field it can be associated a unique non minimally coupled scalar field
in a conformal metric and with a different potential function.

Proof. The action for the non minimally coupled Lagrangian @xmath is:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath for a real field and @xmath for phantom field. Let @xmath
be the conformally related metric (this is not a coordinate
transformation!):

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then the action ( 9.3 ) becomes ¹ ¹ 1 We use the result tha if @xmath is
a @xmath matrix the

@xmath

hence

@xmath (9.4)

:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Replacing [ 150 ]

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath we find:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Define the conformal function in terms of the coupling function @xmath
by the requirement ( @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

We compute

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then the first term in the integral becomes:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The second term gives after integration by parts:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Replacing @xmath from ( 9.6 ) we find:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The third term gives:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Collecting all the results we find:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

or

  -- -- -- -------
           (9.7)
  -- -- -- -------

We introduce the scalar field @xmath with the requirement:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the action becomes

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

We conclude that the scalar field @xmath is minimally coupled to the
gravitational field. Therefore we have proved that to every non
minimally coupled scalar field we may associate a unique minimally
coupled scalar field in a conformally related space and an appropriate
potential. Since all considerations are reversible, the result is
reversible.

In the following section we extend the above proposition to a general
@xmath Riemannian space.

#### 9.3 Generalization to dimension @xmath

Consider the non minimally coupled scalar field @xmath whose field
equations are obtained from the action:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where we have substituted [ 150 ]

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Define the function @xmath in terms of the coupling function @xmath by
the requirement:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For each term of the action @xmath we have the following:
The first term gives:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The second term gives:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Furthermore we compute

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Replacing we find for the second term:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

(note that this is the same with the previous expression for @xmath ).
The third term gives:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Finally the the fourth term gives:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Collecting the results for the last three terms we find

  -- -- -------- -------- --
                 @xmath   
        @xmath   @xmath   
        @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -- -------- -------- --

We define the new scalar field @xmath with the requirement

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In terms of @xmath the action becomes

  -- -- -------- -------- --
                 @xmath   
        @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -- -------- -------- --

Collecting the above we find the action @xmath of a minimally coupled
scalar field

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We note that the new scalar field @xmath is minimally coupled to the
gravitational field @xmath and that the potential of @xmath is @xmath .

The above proof agrees with the one given in the paper of [ 151 ] .
However it is obviously simpler, more direct and clear.

#### 9.4 Conformal Lagrangians in scalar field cosmology

In this section we apply the conformal transformation in the Lagrangian
of the field equations in a FRW spatially flat spacetime.

We consider the flat FRW @xmath spacetime whose metric is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the 3-space metric in Cartesian coordinates. The
Lagrangian of a scalar field @xmath minimally coupled to gravity in
these coordinates is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Lagrangian for a non minimally coupled scalar field @xmath is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the coupling function and @xmath where @xmath for real
scalar field and @xmath for phantom field.  The Hamiltonian for the
Lagrangian ( 9.12 ) is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

We construct a conformal Lagrangian which corresponds to a minimally
coupled scalar field.

To do that we consider first a change in the scale factor from @xmath
@xmath defined by the formula (see [ 152 , 140 ] )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then the Lagrangian ( 9.12 ) takes the form:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

that is, the cross term @xmath disappears.

Next we consider the coordinate transformation:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

and Lagrangian ( 9.15 ) becomes:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

The form of the Lagrangian ( 9.17 ) is ( 9.11 ) hence the previous
result applies and under the conformal transformation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

the Lagrangian ( 9.17 ) becomes:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

where a prime @xmath indicates derivative wrt the new coordinate @xmath

We note that if in the new coordinates @xmath we consider the metric

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

then the term @xmath equals the Ricci scalar @xmath of the conformally
flat metric @xmath Therefore the Lagrangian ( 9.19 ) can be seen as the
Lagrangian of a scalar field @xmath of potential @xmath minimally
coupled to the gravitational filed @xmath in the space with metric
@xmath Replacing the coordinate @xmath and the quantity @xmath from (
9.14 ), ( 9.18 ), we find:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

that is, the metric @xmath is conformally related to the metric @xmath
with conformal function @xmath This means that the non-minimally coupled
scalar field in the gravitational field @xmath is equivalent to a
minimally coupled scalar field - with appropriate potential defined in
terms of the conformal function - in the gravitational field @xmath the
resutl is reversible. Equivalently the Lagrangians @xmath @xmath are
conformally related and the field equations (the Euler-Lagrange
equations) are invariant under the conformal transformation if the
Hamiltonian constrains @xmath vanish (see Lemma 7.2.2 ).

In the following sections we apply the Noether symmetry approach as a
geometric selection rule in order to determine the dark energy models;
that is, we search for dark energy models by requiring the field
equations to admit Noether point symmetries.

#### 9.5 Noether point symmetries of a non minimally coupled Scalar
field.

Consider a non-minimally coupled scalar field with action

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

in a flat FRW space-time, whose metric in Cartesian coordinates is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and @xmath is the Lagrangian of dust matter of density @xmath (for
commoving observers).

The Lagrangian of the field equations is ( 9.12 ) are the Hamiltonian
(total energy density) ( 9.13 ) and the Euler-Lagrange equations

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If the Hamiltonian ( 9.13 ) is @xmath then the space admits dust which,
however does not interact with the scalar field and has energy density
@xmath If @xmath @xmath the space does not admit dust. In the following
we determine all potentials @xmath for which this dynamical system
admits Noether point symmetries beyond the trivial one @xmath .
Subsequently we use the resulting Noether integrals to find analytical
solutions for the field equations for each of these potentials.

In order to determine the Noether point symmetries of the Lagrangian (
9.12 ) we shall follow the results of chapter 4 . That is we brake the
Lagrangian in the kinematic part which defines the kinematic metric and
the remaining part which we consider to be the potential. Then we apply
theorem 4.3.2 which states that the Noether point symmetries of the
Lagrangian follow form the homothetic algebra of the kinematic metric.
The kinematic metric admits a non-trivial homothetic (not necessarily
proper homothetic) algebra if a given condition is satisfied which
involves the symmetry vector and the potential. The solution of this
relation provides all the potentials for which extra Noether symmetries
are admitted. We use the Noether integrals of these extra Noether
symmetries to find an analytic solution for each of the corresponding
potentials..

From the Lagrangian ( 9.12 ) we define the kinematic metric:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is a two dimensional metric in the space @xmath Because the
homothetic algebra of a 2 dimensional metric is different for a flat and
a non-flat (but conformally flat because all two dimensional spaces are
conformally flat) we consider the case the metric ( 9.22 ) is maximally
symmetric ² ² 2 The Ricci scalar is @xmath where @xmath is a constant .

The Ricci scalar of the metric ( 9.22 ) is computed to be:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

Hence if the metric ( 9.22 ) is maximally symmetric then it follows that
@xmath , that is, the kinetic metric ( 9.22 ) must be flat.

##### 9.5.1 Case A. @xmath

Condition @xmath and ( 9.23 ) give:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

provided

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

The solution of ( 9.24 ) is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath . We note that this @xmath satisfies condition (
9.25 ) therefore it is acceptable.

In order to determine the homothetic algebra of the kinematic metric (
9.22 ) we write it in a more familiar form. We introduce the coordinates
@xmath by the relations

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.27)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.28)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

In the new coordinates @xmath the metric ( 9.22 ), the Lagrangian ( 9.12
) and the non minimal coupling function @xmath take the following form

For @xmath and @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.29)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.30)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.31)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

For @xmath and @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.32)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.33)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.34)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

For @xmath and @xmath we introduce a new real field @xmath and get the
real field @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.35)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.36)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.37)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

We see that in the region @xmath starting from a phantom field @xmath we
end up with a real scalar field @xmath

In order to consider the three Lagrangians ( 9.30 ),( 9.33 ),( 9.36 ) at
the same time we consider the Lagrangian

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath where @xmath . The constant @xmath where the
value @xmath is for @xmath and @xmath and the value @xmath is for @xmath
Then the new kinematic metric is written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

We simplify this metric by introducing new coordinates @xmath defined by
the transformation:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

This step is necessary in order to deduce the homothetic algebra of the
metric from well known previous results. In the new coordinates the
metric ( 9.39 ) takes the simple form:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

that is, it is directly related to the flat 2d Lorentzian space with
metric

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with conformal factor @xmath In the new coordinates the curvature scalar
is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

hence the condition @xmath gives the function @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a new constant.

Taking this into account we have that in the @xmath coordinates the
Lagrangian ( 9.38 ) becomes:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

The constant @xmath is related to the previous constant @xmath via the
function @xmath . Using ( 9.40 ) we express @xmath in terms of @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

Comparing with @xmath and eliminating @xmath we find:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is a second expression of @xmath in terms of the constant @xmath
Comparing with the previous expression ( 9.31 ),( 9.34 ) and ( 9.37 ),
which expresses @xmath in terms of @xmath (and holds for all ranges of
values of @xmath we find:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

This relation must hold identically which leads to the conditions

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

In Appendix 9.A we give the relation between the various ranges of the
constant @xmath and the corresponding ranges of the constant @xmath

###### Case @xmath.

For @xmath the homothetic algebra consists of the gradient KVs vectors

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.50)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.51)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

the non gradient KV

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the gradient HV

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the results of chapter 4 we find the following results

1.  The gradient KV @xmath produces Noether symmetries for the following
    potentials

    a) For @xmath we have the Noether symmetries @xmath with Noether
    integrals

      -- -- -- --------
               (9.54)
      -- -- -- --------

    b) For @xmath we have the Noether symmetries @xmath @xmath constant,
    with Noether integrals

      -- -- -- --------
               (9.55)
      -- -- -- --------

    From the Noether integrals we construct the time independent first
    integral @xmath

2.  The gradient KV @xmath produces the following Noether symmetries for
    the following potentials

    a) For @xmath ,we have the Noether symmetries @xmath with Noether
    integrals

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (9.56)
      -- -------- -- --------

    b) For @xmath , we have the Noether symmetries @xmath @xmath
    constant, with Noether integrals

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (9.57)
      -- -------- -- --------

    From the Noether integrals we construct the time independent first
    integral @xmath

3.  The non gradient KV @xmath produces a Noether symmetry for the
    potential @xmath with Noether integral

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (9.58)
      -- -------- -- --------

4.  The gradient HV produces the following Noether symmetries for the
    following potentials

    a) For @xmath , @xmath we have the Noether symmetries @xmath with
    Noether integrals

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (9.59)
      -- -------- -- --------

    We note that in this case the system is the Ermakov-Pinney dynamical
    system (because it admits the Noether symmetry algebra the @xmath
    hence the Lie symmetry algebra is at least @xmath .

    b) For @xmath , @xmath we have the Noether symmetries @xmath ,
    @xmath constant with Noether integrals

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (9.60)
      -- -------- -- --------

    For this potential the Noether symmetries form the @xmath Lie
    algebra, i.e the dynamical system is the two dimensional
    Kepler-Ermakov system Therefore it admits the Ermakov - Pinney
    invariant which we may construct with the use of the Noether
    symmetries or with the use of the corresponding Killing Tensor (see
    Proposition 5.6.2 )

5.  The case @xmath corresponds the free particle (see chapter 2 ).

###### Case @xmath

We have to consider two cases i.e. @xmath and @xmath

###### Case @xmath

The KVs of the kinematic metric are the @xmath of ( 9.50 , 9.51 ) and
the vector

  -- -- -- --------
           (9.61)
  -- -- -- --------

The vectors @xmath are gradient and @xmath is non-gradient. The HV is
gradient and it is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.62)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Case @xmath

The KVs of the kinematic metric are @xmath of ( 9.50 , 9.51 ) and the
vector

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.63)
  -- -------- -- --------

The vectors @xmath are gradient and @xmath is non-gradient. The gradient
HV is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the following we consider only the case @xmath . The results for the
case @xmath are found if we make the change @xmath .

Using theorem 4.3.2 and making simple calculations we find the following
results

1.  Noether symmetries generated by the KV @xmath .

    a) If @xmath then we have the extra Noether symmetries @xmath with
    Noether integrals the ( 9.54 ) with @xmath .

    b) If @xmath , then we have the Noether symmetries @xmath with
    Noether integrals ( 9.55 ) with @xmath .

2.  Noether symmetries generated by the KV @xmath .

    a) If @xmath then we have the Noether symmetries @xmath with Noether
    integrals

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (9.65)
      -- -------- -- --------

    b) If @xmath then we have the Noether symmetries @xmath with Noether
    integrals

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (9.66)
      -- -------- -- --------

3.  If @xmath then the system becomes the free particle and admits seven
    extra Noether symmetries.

As we have remarked the results for @xmath are obtained directly from
those for @xmath if we make the substitution @xmath . Therefore there is
no need to state them explicitly.

In the next section using the Noether symmetries for the potentials we
have found, we determine the analytic solution for each case.

##### 9.5.2 Case A: Analytic solutions for @xmath

We introduce new coordinates @xmath by the relations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

with inverse relations:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.68)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the new coordinates @xmath the Lagrangian ( 9.44 ) of the field
equations becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.69)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the field equations are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where the potential @xmath is one of the potentials we have found in the
last section. In the new coordinates we have ( @xmath are constants;
recall that in general @xmath ):

-   -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (9.70)
      -- -------- -- --------

-   -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (9.71)
      -- -------- -- --------

-   -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (9.72)
      -- -------- -- --------

-   -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (9.73)
      -- -------- -- --------

-   -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (9.74)
      -- -------- -- --------

    The Hamiltonian equals

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (9.75)
      -- -------- -- --------

We write Lagrange equations for each potential and solve them taking
into consideration the first integrals for each Noether symmetry we have
found and the constraint imposed by the Hamiltonian.  For each of the
potentials above we find the corresponding analytic solution given
below.

##### 9.5.3 Case A: Analytic solutions for @xmath

When @xmath we have to consider two cases @xmath and @xmath Both cases
it is convenient to be discussed if we use as variables the functions
@xmath @xmath which generate the Killing vectors (i.e. @xmath @xmath A
standard calculation gives (see appendix B for details) :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.88)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.89)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Because the metric is flat the new variables @xmath @xmath are Cartesian
and will be denoted with @xmath So we write:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.90)
  -- -------- -- --------

The inverse transformation is:

for @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath               (9.91)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.92)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

and

for @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath         (9.93)
     @xmath   @xmath         (9.94)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- --------

Note that in the second case we have written @xmath while we have kept
the @xmath notation for the case @xmath

###### The case @xmath

Before we look for analytic solutions we transform the Lagrangian in the
canonical coordinates @xmath Using the transformation relations ( 9.91
), ( 9.92 ) we find that in the coordinates @xmath the Lagrangian ( 9.42
) takes the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.95)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath where @xmath is one of the potentials computed above. In
the coordinates @xmath these potentials are as follows:

-   -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (9.96)
      -- -------- -- --------

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (9.97)
      -- -------- -- --------

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (9.98)
      -- -------- -- --------

-   -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

To the potentials @xmath @xmath we have to add three more which we
obtain by the addition of the potential of the harmonic oscillator.
Therefore finally we have 7 potentials. The extra potentials are

-   -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.99)
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.100)
      -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

    where @xmath

-   -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (9.101)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    where @xmath .

-   And the free particle potential

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (9.102)
      -- -------- -- ---------

These expressions allow us to write for each potential the Lagrangian
and the Hamiltonian constraint in the coordinates @xmath . This means
that we obtain the corresponding field equations in the coordinates
@xmath to determine their solution.

###### Analytic solutions

The solution of the field equations for each potential is a formal and
lengthy operation which adds nothing but unnecessary material to the
matter. What is interesting is of course the final answer for each case
and this is what we give below for each of the potentials above.

    This is the Ermakov Pinney system. To solve it, it is convenient to
    go to spherical coordinates. We consider the coordinate
    transformation

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (9.115)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    and the Lagrangian takes the form

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (9.116)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    whereas the Hamiltonian becomes

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (9.117)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    This system admits the Ermakov-Lewis invariant, which is

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (9.118)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    Using the Ermakov invariant the Hamiltonian becomes

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (9.119)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    This is the Hamiltonian of the Ermakov Pinney equation:

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (9.120)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    whose solution is

      -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.121)

    where @xmath are solutions of the differential equation @xmath and
    @xmath are constants.

-   @xmath

    This is the free particle whose solution is

         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.124)
      -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

###### The case @xmath

In this case the canonical coordinates are the @xmath Using the
transformation equations ( 9.93 ), ( 9.94 ) we write the Lagrangian (
9.42 ) as follows:

  -- -- -- ---------
           (9.125)
  -- -- -- ---------

where @xmath the potentials @xmath being as above. In the coordinates
@xmath the potentials @xmath are:

               (9.129)
      -- -- -- ---------

As before we have three more potentials

-   -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.130)
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.131)

-   and the free particle potential.

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (9.133)

and the associated Hamiltonian constraint for each of the potentials
above.

    where @xmath and the Hamiltonian @xmath .

      -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.138)
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.139)
      -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

    where @xmath and the Hamiltonian constrain @xmath .

      -- -------- -------- -------- --
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath

      -- -------- -------- -------- --

    where @xmath

-   @xmath . @xmath .

    This is again the Ermakov Piney potential. To solve it we go to
    spherical coordinates

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (9.140)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    in which the Lagrangian takes the form

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (9.141)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    and the Hamiltonian

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (9.142)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    The Ermakov-Lewis invariant is

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (9.143)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    which when replaced in the Hamiltonian gives

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (9.144)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    This is the Hamiltonian of the Ermakov Pinney equation:

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (9.145)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    whose solution is

      -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.146)
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.147)
      -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

    where @xmath are solutions of the ode @xmath and @xmath are
    constants.

-   @xmath

-   This is the free particle whose solution is

      -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.148)
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.149)
      -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

##### 9.5.4 Case B: The 2d metric is conformally flat

In this case it is preferable to work with ( 9.39 ) which under the
coordinate transformation ( 9.40 ) becomes:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.150)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The kinetic metric in this case is not flat (i.e. @xmath but of course
it is conformally flat being a two dimensional metric. Its conformal
algebra is infinity dimensional however it has a closed subalgebra
consisting of the following vectors (this is the special conformal
algebra of @xmath ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.151)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

Writing @xmath we find the conformal factors of the CKVs @xmath @xmath
above in terms of the the conformal function. The result is:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.152)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

The @xmath , otherwise the kinetic metric of the Lagrangian ( 9.150 ) is
flat (the Ricci scalar vanishes) and we return to the previous case A.
This means that the vectors @xmath @xmath except the @xmath are proper
CKVs therefore they do not give (in general) a Noether symmetry. The
vector @xmath is a non-gradient HV which does not also produce a Noether
symmetry. Therefore according to theorem 4.3.2 only Killing vectors are
possible to serve as Noether symmetries. KVs do not exist but for
special forms of the conformal function @xmath . Each such form of
@xmath results in a potential @xmath hence to a scalar field potential
which admits Noether point symmetries. In the following we determine the
possible @xmath which lead to a KV and give the corresponding Noether
symmetry and the corresponding Noether integral which will be used for
the solution of the field equations.

1.  If @xmath then @xmath is a non gradient KV and a Noether symmetry
    for the Lagrangian ( 9.150 ) for the potential

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (9.153)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    The corresponding Noether integral is

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (9.154)
      -- -------- -- ---------

2.  If @xmath then @xmath is a non gradient KV, @xmath and a Noether
    symmetry for the Lagrangian ( 9.150 ) if

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (9.155)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    The corresponding Noether integral is

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (9.156)
      -- -------- -- ---------

3.  If @xmath then the linear combination @xmath where @xmath and @xmath
    . @xmath is a Noether symmetry for the Lagrangian ( 9.150 ) if

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (9.157)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    with Noether integral

      -- -- --
            
      -- -- --

    Obviously case 3 is the most general and contains cases 1 and 2 (and
    the trivial case) as special cases. Therefore in the following we
    look for analytic solutions for the vector @xmath only.

We recall that @xmath from which follows:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.158)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We may consider @xmath (e.g. by introducing the new variable @xmath

For the potential ( 9.157 ) the Lagrangian ( 9.150 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.159)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and the Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.160)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The equations of motion are:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.161)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.162)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

and the Noether integral @xmath for @xmath becomes:

  -- -- -- ---------
           (9.163)
  -- -- -- ---------

In order to proceed with the solution of the system of equations ( 9.161
), ( 9.162 ) we change to the coordinates @xmath which we define by the
relations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.164)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In the coordinates @xmath the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian become:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.165)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.166)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and the Noether integral (we write @xmath for @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.167)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Let us assume that @xmath In the new variables the Euler - Lagrange
equations read:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.168)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.169)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

From the Noether integral we have @xmath which upon substitution in the
field equations gives the equation

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.170)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.171)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

from which we compute

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.172)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and finally the analytic solution

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.173)
  -- -------- -- ---------

From the Noether integral we find

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.174)
  -- -------- -- ---------

If @xmath then the analytic solution is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.175)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with Hamiltonian constrain @xmath

If @xmath (i.e. free particle) and @xmath the analytic solution is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.176)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with Hamiltonian constrain @xmath

#### 9.6 Noether point symmetries of a minimally coupled Scalar field.

In this section we study the Noether point symmetries of a minimally
coupled scalar field in a spatially flat FRW spacetime. The action of
the field equations is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.177)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the Lagrangian of the dust matter fluid. For a spatially
flat FRW spacetime the Ricciscalar is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

hence, the Lagrangian of the field equation is ( 9.11 ) and the field
equations are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.178)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.179)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.180)
  -- -------- -- ---------

From the kinetic term of ( 9.11 ) we define the two dimensional metric

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.181)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We find that the curvature of the @xmath space is @xmath implying
flatness (since all @xmath dimensional spaces are Einstein spaces hence
@xmath implies that the space is flat). Also, the signature of the
metric eq.( 9.181 ) is @xmath , hence the space is the 2-d Minkowski
space. In order to simplify the field equations we apply the following
coordinate transformation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.182)
  -- -------- -- ---------

in the new coordinates the two dimensional metric ( 9.181 ) is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.183)
  -- -------- -- ---------

that is, @xmath are hyperbolic spherical coordinates in the two
dimensional Minkowski space @xmath . Next we introduce the new
coordinates @xmath with the transformation:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.184)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

which implies that the metric ( 9.183 ) becomes @xmath . We also point
here that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.185)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The scale factor ( @xmath ) is now given by:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.186)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which means that the new variables have to satisfy the following
inequality: @xmath .

In the new coordinate system @xmath the Lagrangian ( 9.11 ) and the
Hamiltonian ( 9.178 ) are written:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.187)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.188)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.189)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Note that we have used

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.190)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We now proceed in an attempt to provide the Noether point symmetries of
the current dynamical problem using the results of chapter 4 .

Since the Lagrangian ( 9.187 ) is autonomous admits the Noether point
symmetry @xmath with Noether integral the Hamiltonian ( 9.188 ).
Lagrangian ( 9.187 ) admits extra Noether point symmetries in the
following cases.

##### 9.6.1 Hyperbolic - UDM Potential

Hyperbolic - UDM Potential: Generically, we use the following potential:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.191)
  -- -------- -- ---------

or

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.192)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The corresponding Noether symmetries, @xmath , are known (see for
example [ 5 ] ). These are:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

The Noether integrals are the Hamiltonian and the quantities:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

Obviously the UDM potential is a particular case of the current general
hyperbolic potential. Indeed for @xmath and with the aid of eqs.( 9.182
), ( 9.190 ) we fully recover the UDM potential [ 153 , 154 , 155 , 142
]

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.193)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath modulus a constant.

##### 9.6.2 Exponential Potential

Exponential Potential: The exponential potential

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

admits the extra Noether symmetry

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.194)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In general the Noether integral for the vector @xmath is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.195)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the Hamiltonian. Using @xmath together with eq.( 9.182 )
and eq.( 9.190 ) we write the potential to its nominal form [ 156 ]
which is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.196)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath modulus a constant ³ ³ 3 In the special case of @xmath ,
the system admits an additional Lie symmetry @xmath , with Noether
integral @xmath .

We note that the analytic solutions of sections 9.5.3 and 9.5.4 are also
solutions for the minimally coupled Lagrangian ( 9.11 ) if and only if
the space does not admit dust.

#### 9.7 The Lie and Noether symmetries of Bianchi class A homogeneous
cosmologies with a scalar field.

The class of Bianchi spatially homogeneous cosmologies contains many
important cosmological models, including the standard FRW model. In
these models the spacetime manifold is foliated along the time axis,
with three dimensional homogeneous hypersurfaces. Bianchi has classified
all three dimensional real Lie algebras and has shown that there are
nine of them. This results in nine types (two of them being families of
spacetimes) of Bianchi spatially homogeneous spacetimes. The principal
advantage of Bianchi cosmological models is that, in these models the
physical variables depend on the time only, reducing the Einstein and
other governing equations to ordinary differential equations.

The Bianchi models are studied in the well known ADM decomposition ( [
157 , 158 ] ) according to which the metric is written

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.197)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the lapse function and @xmath is the canonical basis of
1-forms which satisfy the Lie algebra

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.198)
  -- -------- -- ---------

@xmath are the structure constants of the algebra. The spatial metric
@xmath splits so that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.199)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the scale factor of the universe and @xmath is a @xmath
symmetric, traceless matrix, which can be written in a diagonal form
with two independent quantities, the so called anisotropy parameters
@xmath , as follows:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.200)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The Bianchi models are grouped in classes A and B by means of a vector
@xmath and a symmetric 3 @xmath metric @xmath which are constrainted by
the condition @xmath Class A is defined by @xmath and Class B by @xmath
Each Class is divided into several types according to the rank and (the
modulus of the) signature of @xmath Because of the difficulty in
formulating the class B Bianchi models in the ADM formalism, it is
usually the case that one confines attention to the class A models.
Furthermore it is well known that for the class A models there is a
Lagrangian [ 159 ] whereas for the class B models, to the author’s
knowledge, no such Lagrangian seems to exist. Details on the structure
and the Physics of the Bianchi models can be found e.g. in [ 157 , 159 ]
.

Research in Physics on inflationary models has shown the importance of
scalar fields in cosmology [ 160 ] . This has raised interest in the
dynamics of Bianchi spacetimes filled with a scalar field, with an
arbitrary self interaction potential, minimally coupled to the
gravitational field [ 161 ] . The Lagrangian leading to the full Bianchi
scalar field dynamics is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.201)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the Ricci scalar of the @xmath dimensional spatial
hypersurfaces given by the expression:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

The constants @xmath and @xmath are the components of the classification
vector @xmath and @xmath @xmath . It is important to note that the
curvature scalar @xmath does not depend on the derivatives of the
anisotropy parameters @xmath @xmath , equivalently on @xmath

The Euler Lagrange equations due to the Lagrangian ( 9.201 ) are [ 86 ]
:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

where a dot over a symbol indicates derivative with respect to @xmath

In the following we apply Theorem 4.2.2 and Theorem 4.3.2 and compute
the Lie and the Noether point symmetries of class A Bianchi models. The
Lie and the Noether point symmetries of Bianchi class A models with a
scalar field have also been computed in [ 86 , 143 , 139 ] . However, as
it will be shown, these studies are not complete, in the sense that they
have not found all Noether symmetries. Furthermore our approach is
entirely different than the classical Lie approach employed in these
works. Finally it is general and can be applied without difficulty to
Class B spacetimes.

We consider the four dimensional Riemannian space with coordinates
@xmath and metric

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.202)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The metric ( 9.202 ) is the conformally flat FRW spacetime whose special
projective algebra consists of the non gradient KVs [ 46 , 45 ]

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

and the gradient HV

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The Lagrangian ( 9.201 ) is written:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the geodesic Lagrangian, @xmath is the potential
function

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.203)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and we have used the fact that the curvature scalar does not depend on
the derivatives of the coordinates @xmath Now we apply Theorem 4.2.2 and
Theorem 4.3.2 to determine the Lie and the point Noether symmetries of
the dynamical system with Lagrangian ( 9.201 ).

In order to compute the potential @xmath we need the expression of
@xmath for each Bianchi type. We find for the Class A models

Bianchi I: @xmath

Bianchi II: @xmath

Bianchi VI @xmath : Class A. , @xmath

Bianchi VII @xmath : Class A., @xmath

Bianchi VIII: @xmath

Bianchi IX: @xmath .

We determine the Lie and the Noether point symmetries in the following
cases:

Case 1. Vacuum. In this case @xmath constant and the metric ( 9.202 )
reduces to the three dimensional FRW metric.

Case 2. Zero potential @xmath @xmath

Case 3. Constant Potential @xmath constant, @xmath

Case 4. Arbitrary Potential @xmath

##### 9.7.1 Bianchi I

Case 1.

In this case @xmath , @xmath and the Lagrangian becomes @xmath hence the
potential @xmath where @xmath The auxiliary metric is @xmath The special
PCs of this metric are the non gradient KVs @xmath and the gradient HV
@xmath .
From Theorem 4.2.2 we find that the Lie point symmetries are the vectors

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which coincide with those found in [ 86 ] . From Theorem 4.3.2 we find
that the Noether point  symmetries are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

i.e. we find two more Noether symmetries than [ 86 ] .

Case 2 . @xmath @xmath

In this case the Lagrangian is @xmath and the potential function @xmath
The auxiliary metric is ( 9.202 ). From Theorem 4.2.2 we find that the
Lie point  symmetries are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and coincide with those found in [ 86 ] . Application of Theorem 4.3.2
gives that the Noether point  symmetries are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

i.e. two more from the ones found in [ 86 ] .

Case 3. @xmath

The Lagrangian is @xmath hence the potential @xmath Using Theorem 4.2.2
we find that the Lie point  symmetries are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath , and coincide with those found in [ 86 ] . Application of
Theorem 4.3.2 gives the Noether point  symmetries

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Again we find two more Noether symmetries than [ 86 ] .

Case 4. @xmath arbitrary @xmath

In this case the Lagrangian is @xmath and the potential @xmath .
Application of Theorem 4.2.2 gives the Lie point  symmetries @xmath and
application of Theorem 4.3.2 gives the Noether symmetries @xmath

Working in a similar manner we compute the Lie and the Noether point
 symmetries of all Bianchi class A homogenous spacetimes. The results of
the calculations are collected in the following Tables.

From the above tables we infer that the Lie point  symmetries we found
coincide with those of [ 86 ] . Some differences which appear are due to
linear combinations of symmetries from the other set. The same does not
apply to the Noether symmetries, for which we found a larger number than
in [ 86 ] .

We note that in Case 1 the Noether symmetry @xmath is a combination of
two Lie point  symmetries, which is peculiar since the Noether point
 symmetries are considered to be a direct subset of Lie symmetries. This
is explained as follows. The addition of a Killing vector to a
homothetic vector retains a homothetic vector. Therefore a Lie symmetry
due to a Killing vector and one due to a homothetic vector is possible
to give a Lie point symmetry due to a homothetic vector. Concerning [
143 ] from the examination of the Tables 9.1 - 9.4 and the results they
present it can be seen that they loose the Noether symmetries which have
a component along @xmath direction.

###### The Bianchi I model with scalar field and exponential potential

We consider a scalar field described by an exponential potential @xmath
in a Bianchi class A spacetime. For this potential all the models admit
the extra Lie symmetry @xmath Concerning the Noether symmetries we have
an extra Noether symmetry only for the types I. II, VI @xmath VII @xmath
as follows:

Type I

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Type II

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Type VI @xmath VII @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In the following we concentrate on the Bianchi I model and make use of
the extra Noether integral to define a transformation [ 162 ] which
allows the determination of the analytic form of the metric.

The Lagrangian describing a scalar field with exponential potential in
an empty Bianchi I spacetime is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.204)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and the corresponding Hamiltonian vanishes. The metric defined by this
Lagrangian is ( 9.202 ).

Using the transformation @xmath the Lagrangian becomes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We change variables by means of the transformation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the Lagrangian takes the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Next we change the time coordinate as follows

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We make one more change @xmath and in the coordinates @xmath the
Lagrangian is:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.205)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath @xmath The equations of motion are

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.206)
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.207)
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.208)
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.209)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

with constrain (the zero Hamiltonian) @xmath These expressions are
symmetric in @xmath therefore we set @xmath and the system of equations
of motion becomes

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.210)
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.211)
              @xmath      (9.212)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

with constraint

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.213)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We consider two cases @xmath and @xmath .

For @xmath the metric is @xmath The potential is the gradient KV @xmath
and the solution of the system is

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.214)
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.215)
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.216)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

For @xmath we make use of the extra Noether integral @xmath and solve
the system. We find that @xmath and that the system has two solutions.
The first is:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.217)
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.218)
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.219)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

and the second:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.220)
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.221)
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.222)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

These solutions complement the results of [ 163 ]

#### 9.8 Conclusion

In this chapter we have studied conformally related metrics and
Lagrangians in the context of scalar–tensor cosmology. We have found
that to every non-minimally coupled scalar field we can associate a
unique minimally coupled scalar field in a conformally related space
with an appropriate potential. The existence of such a connection can be
used in order to study the dynamical properties of the various
cosmological models, since the field equations of a non-minimally
coupled scalar field are the same, at the conformal level, of the field
equations of the minimally coupled scalar field. The above propositions
can be extended to general Riemannian spaces in n-dimensions.
Furthermore, we have identified the Noether point symmetries and the
analytic solutions of the equations of motion in the context of a
minimally coupled and a non minimally coupled scalar field in a FRW
spacetime and we have classified the Noether symmetries of the field
equations in Bianchi class A models with a minimally coupled scalar
field. We found that there is a rather large class of hyperbolic and
exponential potentials which admit extra (beyond the @xmath ) Noether
pont symmetries which lead to integrals of motions.

In general, the Noether point symmetries play an important role in
physics because they can be used to simplify a given system of
differential equations as well as to determine the integrability of the
system. The latter will provide the necessary platform in order to solve
the equations of motion analytically and thus to obtain the evolution of
the physical quantities. In cosmology, such a method is extremely
relevant in order to compare cosmographic parameters, such as scale
factor, Hubble expansion rate, deceleration parameter, density
parameters with observational constrains.

However, since the Noether point symmetries are generated from the
kinetic metric of the Lagrangian, they are not only a criterion for the
integrability of the system and a method to determine analytical
solutions of the field equations, but they are also a geometric
criterion since by demanding the existence of Noether symmetries we let
the geometry to select the dynamics, i.e. the dark energy model.

In the following chapters we study the Noether symmetries of the @xmath
and the @xmath theories of gravity.

### Appendix 9.A Relating the ranges of the constants @xmath and @xmath

We consider the following ranges for the constants @xmath and @xmath

a. @xmath In this case we have @xmath from which follows

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

b. @xmath In this case we have @xmath from which follows .

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

c. @xmath @xmath Then @xmath from which follows

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The ranges of @xmath are needed because they select different groups of
Killing vectors of the metric ( 9.41 ).

### Appendix 9.B Computation of the gradient functions @xmath @xmath

The functions @xmath @xmath are the canonical coordinates @xmath for the
KVs @xmath The canonical coordinates are defined with the requirement
@xmath and are computed as follows. We have the system of differential
equations:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

To solve it we consider the associated Lagrange system and write:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The first equation gives:

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

The second equation gives:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

hence we have (this is the @xmath ):

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For the other coordinate we have:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The first equation gives:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the second equation gives:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

hence (this is the @xmath ):

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Therefore, we have the canonical coordinates

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

### Chapter 10 Using Noether point symmetries to specify @xmath gravity

#### 10.1 Introduction

In chapter 9 we used the Noether point symmetries of the scalar tensor
theories in order to constrain the dark energy models. Except the
sclarar field cosmology there are other possibilities to explain the
present accelerating stage. For instance, one may consider that the
dynamical effects attributed to dark energy can be resembled by the
effects of a nonstandard gravity theory. In other words, the present
accelerating stage of the universe can be driven only by cold dark
matter, under a modification of the nature of gravity. Such a reduction
of the so-called dark sector is naturally obtained in the @xmath gravity
theories [ 87 ] . In the original nonstandard gravity models, one
modifies the Einstein-Hilbert action with a general function @xmath of
the Ricci scalar @xmath . The @xmath approach is a relatively simple but
still a fundamental tool used to explain the accelerated expansion of
the universe. A pioneering fundamental approach was proposed long ago
with @xmath [ 164 ] . Later on, the @xmath models were further explored
from different points of view in [ 89 , 88 , 165 ] and indeed a large
number of functional forms of @xmath gravity is currently available in
the literature [ 140 , 166 , 167 , 168 , 169 ] .

In the following, we will use the Lie and the Noether point symmetries
in order to specify the @xmath gravity in a FRW spacetime and use the
first integrals of these models to determine analytic solutions of their
field equations.

The structure of this chapter is as follows. The basic theoretical
elements of the problem are presented in section 10.2 , where we also
introduce the basic FRW cosmological equations in the framework of
@xmath models. The Noether point symmetries and their relevance to the
@xmath models are discussed in section 10.4 . In section 10.5 we provide
analytical solutions for those @xmath models which are Liouville
integrable via Noether point symmetries. In section 10.6 we study the
Noether point symmetries in spatially non-flat @xmath cosmological
models. Finally, we draw our main conclusions in section 10.7 .

#### 10.2 Cosmology with a modified gravity

Consider the modified Einstein-Hilbert action:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the Lagrangian of dust-like ( @xmath ) matter and @xmath
. Varying the action with respect to the metric ¹ ¹ 1 We use the metric
i.e. the Hilbert variational approach. we arrive at

  -- -- -- --------
           (10.2)
  -- -- -- --------

where the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath , @xmath is
the Einstein tensor and @xmath is the ordinary energy-momentum tensor of
matter. Based on the matter era we treat the expanding universe as a
dust fluid which includes only cold dark matter with comoving observers
@xmath . Thus the energy momentum tensor becomes @xmath , where @xmath
is the energy density of the cosmic fluid.

Now, in the context of a flat FRW model the metric is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

The components of the Einstein tensor are computed to be:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

Inserting ( 10.4 ) into the modified Einstein’s field equations ( 10.2
), for comoving observers, we derive the modified Friedman’s equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.6)
  -- -------- -- --------

The contraction of the Ricci tensor provides the Ricci scalar

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.7)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Bianchi identity @xmath leads to the matter conservation law:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.8)
  -- -------- -- --------

whose solution is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.9)
  -- -------- -- --------

Note that the over-dot denotes derivative with respect to the cosmic
time @xmath and @xmath is the Hubble parameter.

If we consider @xmath then the field equations ( 10.2 ) boil down to the
Einstein’s equations. On the other hand, the concordance @xmath
cosmology is fully recovered for @xmath .

From the current analysis it becomes clear that unlike the standard
Friedman equations in Einstein’s GR, the modified equations of motion (
10.5 ) and ( 10.6 ) are complicated and thus it is difficult to solve
them analytically.

We would like to stress here that within the context of the metric
formalism the above @xmath cosmological models must obey simultaneously
some strong conditions [ 136 ] . These are: (i) @xmath for @xmath ,
where @xmath is the Ricci scalar at the present time. If the final
attractor is a de Sitter point we need to have @xmath for @xmath , where
@xmath is the Ricci scalar at the de Sitter point, (ii) @xmath for
@xmath , (iii) @xmath for @xmath and finally (iv) @xmath at @xmath

#### 10.3 Modified gravity versus symmetries

In the last decade a large number of experiments have been proposed in
order to constrain dark energy and study its evolution. Naturally, in
order to establish the evolution of the dark energy (DE)
(”geometrical” in the current work) equation of state parameter a
realistic form of @xmath is required while the included free parameters
must be constrained through a combination of independent DE probes (for
example SNIa, BAOs, CMB etc). However, a weak point here is the fact
that the majority of the @xmath models appeared in the literature are
plagued with no clear physical basis and/or many free parameters. Due to
the large number of free parameters many such models could fit the data.
The proposed additional criterion of Noether point symmetry requirement
is a physically meaning-full geometric ansatz.

According to the theory of general relativity, the space-time Killing
and homothetic symmetries via the Einstein’s field equations, are also
symmetries of the energy momentum tensor. Due to the fact that the
@xmath models provide a natural generalization of GR one would expect
that the theories of modified gravity must inherit the symmetries of the
space-time as the usual gravity (GR) does.

Furthermore, besides the geometric symmetries we have to consider the
dynamical symmetries, which are the symmetries of the field equations
(Lie symmetries). If the field equations are derived from a Lagrangian
then there is the special class of Lie symmetries, the Noether
symmetries, which lead to conserved currents or, equivalently, to first
integrals of the equations of motion. The Noether integrals are used to
reduce the order of the field equations or even to solve them. Therefore
a sound requirement, which is possible to be made in Lagrangian
theories, is that they admit extra Noether symmetries. This assumption
is model independent, because it is imposed after the field equations
have been derived, therefore it does not lead to conflict with the
geometric symmetries while, at the same time, serves the original
purpose of a selection rule. Of course, it is possible that a different
method could be assumed and select another subset of viable models.
However, symmetry has always played a dominant role in Physics and this
gives an aesthetic and a physical priority to our proposal.

In the Lagrangian context, the main field equations ( 10.5 ) and ( 10.6
), described in section 10.2 , can be produced by the following
Lagrangian:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.10)
  -- -------- -- ---------

in the space of the variables @xmath . Using eq.( 10.10 ) we obtain the
Hamiltonian of the current dynamical system

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.11)
  -- -------- -- ---------

or

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.12)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Combining the first equation of motion ( 10.5 ) with eq.( 10.12 ) we
find

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.13)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The latter equation together with @xmath implies that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.14)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath , @xmath is the critical density at the present time and
@xmath is the Hubble constant.

We note that the current Lagrangian eq.( 10.10 ) is time independent
implying that the dynamical system is autonomous hence the Hamiltonian
@xmath is conserved.

#### 10.4 Noether point symmetries of @xmath gravity

The Noether condition for the Lagrangian ( 10.10 ) is equivalent with
the following system of eight equations

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (10.15)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (10.16)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.17)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.18)

The solution of the system ( 10.15 )-( 10.22 ) determines the Noether
symmetries.

Since the Lagrangian ( 10.10 ) is in the form @xmath , the results of
chapter 4 can be used ² ² 2 Where @xmath is the ”kinetic” term and
@xmath is the ”potential . The kinematic term defines a two dimensional
metric in the space of @xmath with line element

while the ”potential” is

     @xmath      (10.24)

The Ricci scalar of the two dimensional metric ( 10.23 ) is computed to
be @xmath therefore the space is a flat space ³ ³ 3 All two dimensional
Riemannian spaces are Einstein spaces implying that if @xmath the space
is maximally symmetric [ 23 ] and if @xmath the space admit gradient

homothetic algebra of the metric ( 10.23 ) consists of the vectors

where @xmath are Killing vectors ( @xmath are gradient) and @xmath is a
gradient Homothetic vector.

Therefore applying theorem 4.3.2 we have the following cases:

with corresponding Noether Integral

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (10.43)

and the commutator of the Noether algebra is @xmath

We note that the Noether subalgebra of case 2, @xmath and the algebra of
case 4 @xmath is the same Lie algebra but in different representation.
The same observation applies to the subalgebra of case 3 @xmath and the
algebra of case 5 @xmath . This connection between the Lie groups is
useful because it reveals common features in the dynamic systems, as is
the common transformation to the normal coordinates of the systems.

#### 10.6 Noether point symmetries in spatially non-flat @xmath models

In this section we study further the Noether point symmetries in non
flat @xmath cosmological models. In the context of a FRW spacetime the
Lagrangian of the overall dynamical problem and the Ricci scalar are

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (10.101)
  -- -------- -- ----------

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (10.102)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the spatial curvature. Note that the two dimensional
metric is given by eq.( 10.23 ) while the ”potential” in the Lagrangian
takes the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (10.103)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Based on the above equations and using the theoretical formulation
presented in section 10.4 , we find that the @xmath models which admit
non trivial Noether symmetries are the @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . The
Noether symmetries can be found in section 10.4 .

In particular, inserting @xmath into the Lagrangian ( 10.101 ) and
changing the variables from @xmath to @xmath [see section 10.5.3 ] we
find

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (10.104)
  -- -------- -- ----------

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (10.105)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath . Therefore, the equations of motion are

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The constant term @xmath appearing in the first equation of motion is
not expected to affect the Noether symmetries (or the integrals of
motion). Indeed we find that the corresponding Noether symmetries
coincide with those of the spatially flat @xmath model. However, in the
case of @xmath (or @xmath ) the analytic solution for the @xmath
-variable is written as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (10.106)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the solution of the flat model @xmath (see section
10.5.3 ). Note that the solution of the @xmath -variable remains
unaltered.

Similarly, for the @xmath model the analytic solution is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (10.107)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the solution of the spatially flat model (see section
10.5.1 ).

#### 10.7 Conclusion

In the literature the functional forms of @xmath of the modified @xmath
gravity models are mainly defined on a phenomenological basis. In this
article we use the Noether symmetry approach to constrain these models
with the aim to utilize the existence of non-trivial Noether symmetries
as a selection criterion that can distinguish the @xmath models on a
more fundamental level. Furthermore the resulting Noether integrals can
be used to provide analytic solutions.

In the context of @xmath models, the system of the modified field
equations is equivalent to a two dimensional dynamical system moving in
@xmath (mini superspace) under the constraint @xmath constant. Following
the general methodology of chapter 4 , we require that the two
dimensional system admits extra Noether point symmetries. This
requirement fixes the @xmath function and the corresponding analytic
solutions are computed. It is interesting that two well known dynamical
systems appear in cosmology: the anharmonic oscillator and the
Ermakov-Pinney system. We recall that the field equations of the @xmath
cosmology is equivalent with that of the hyperbolic oscillator.

### Appendix 10.A Special solutions for the power law model @xmath

The case @xmath is not Liouville integrable via Noether point
symmetries. However the zero order invariant will be used in order to
find special solutions. Inserting @xmath into eq.( 10.10 ) we obtain

  -- -------- -- ----------

     @xmath      (10.110)
  -- -------- -- ----------

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (10.111)

we have the zero order invariants

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (10.112)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Applying the zero order invariants in the field equations ( 10.109 )-(
10.111 ) and in the Noether integral ( 10.43 ) we have the following
results.

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (10.113)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the constants @xmath @xmath @xmath and @xmath are

     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

or

     @xmath

or

     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Another special solution is the deSitter solution for @xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (10.114)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath and the spacetime is empty i.e. @xmath .

### Chapter 11 Noether symmetries in @xmath gravity

#### 11.1 Introduction

In this chapter we continue our analysis on the application of Noether
point symmetries in alternative theories of gravity and specifically the
@xmath modified theory of gravity. @xmath gravity it is based on the old
formulation of Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR) [
171 , 172 , 173 , 174 ] which instead of the torsion-less Levi-Civita
connection uses the curvatureless Weitzenbock connection [ 175 ] in
which the corresponding dynamical fields are the four linearly
independent vierbeins. Therefore, all the information concerning the
gravitational field is included in the Weitzenbock tensor. Within this
framework, considering invariance under general coordinate
transformations, global Lorentz-parity transformations, and requiring up
to second order terms of the torsion tensor, one can write down the
corresponding Lagrangian density @xmath by using some suitable
contractions.

Furthermore @xmath gravity which is based on the fact that we allow the
Lagrangian to be a function of @xmath [ 176 , 177 , 178 ] , inspired by
the extension of @xmath Einstein-Hilbert action. However, @xmath gravity
does not coincide with @xmath extension, but it rather consists of a
different class of modified gravity models. It is interesting to mention
that the torsion tensor includes only products of first derivatives of
the vierbeins, giving rise to second-order field differential equations
in contrast to the @xmath gravity that provides fourth-order equations,
which potentially may lead to some problems, for example in the well
position and well formulation of the Cauchy problem [ 179 ] . Moreover,
as we showed in chapter 10 the Lagrangian of the field equations in
@xmath gravity described a regular dynamical system; however, in @xmath
the dynamical system is singular and the @xmath variable can be seen as
a Lagrange multiplier.

In section 11.2 we discuss the role of unholonomic frames in the context
of teleparallel gravity and its straightforward extension. In section
11.3 , we briefly present @xmath gravity, while in section 11.4 we
construct the corresponding generalized Lagrangian formulation. In
section 11.5 , we analyze the main properties of the Noether Symmetry
Approach for @xmath gravity. Then, in section 11.6 and 11.7 , we apply
these results in the FRW and the static spherically symmetric spaces.

#### 11.2 Unholonomic frames and Connection Coefficient

In an @xmath dimensional manifold @xmath consider a coordinate
neighborhood @xmath with a coordinate system @xmath At each point @xmath
we have the resulting holonomic frame @xmath We define in @xmath a new
frame @xmath which is related to the holonomic frame @xmath as follows:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (11.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the quantities @xmath are in general functions of the coordinates
(i.e. depend on the point @xmath ). Notice that Latin indexes count
vectors, while Greek indexes are tensor indices. We assume that @xmath
which guaranties that the vectors @xmath form a set of linearly
independent vectors. We define the ”inverse” quantities @xmath by means
of the following ”orthogonality” relations:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (11.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

The commutators of the vectors @xmath are not in general all zero. If
they are, then there exists a new coordinate system in @xmath , the
@xmath say so that @xmath i.e. the new frame is holonomic. If there are
commutators @xmath then the new frame @xmath is called unholonomic and
the vectors @xmath cannot be written in the form @xmath The quantities
which characterize an unholonomic frame are the objects of
unholonomicity or Ricci rotation coefficients @xmath defined by the
relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (11.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

We compute:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

from which follows that the Ricci rotation coefficients of the frame
@xmath are:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (11.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

The condition for @xmath to be a holonomic basis is @xmath at all points
@xmath This is a set of linear partial differential equations whose
solution defines all holonomic frames and all coordinate systems in
@xmath One obvious solution is @xmath . The set of all coordinate
systems in @xmath equipped with the operation of composition of
transformations has the structure of an infinite dimensional Lie group
which is called the Manifold Mapping Group.

We consider now the special unholonomic frames which satisfy Jacobi’s
identity:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (11.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

These frames are the generators of a Lie Algebra, therefore they have an
extra role to play. Replacing the commutator in terms of the
unholonomicity objects we find the following identity:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (11.6)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the definition of the covariant derivative we write:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (11.7)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are the connection coefficients in the frame @xmath Let us
compute these @xmath assuming that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

from which follows

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Consider three vector fields @xmath and the covariant derivative of the
metric wrt @xmath Then we have:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (11.8)
  -- -------- -- --------

and by interchanging the role of @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (11.9)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.10)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Adding ( 11.8 ), ( 11.9 ) and subtracting ( 11.10 ) we obtain:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

then

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

that is

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The term

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Replacing in the last relation and solving for @xmath we find

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

or

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Define the quantities

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The tensors @xmath and @xmath are called the torsion and the metricity
of the connection @xmath respectively. Last relation in terms of the
fields @xmath and @xmath is written as follows @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (11.11)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

Let @xmath and @xmath Contracting with @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Replacing in ( 11.11 ) we find the connection coefficients in the frame
@xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.12)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the standard Levi Civita connection coefficients
(Christofell symbols).  This is the most general expression for the
connection coefficients in terms of the fields @xmath @xmath @xmath and
@xmath .

Concerning the symmetric and antisymmetric part we have:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (11.13)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (11.14)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

From the above we draw the following conclusions:

1. The connection coefficients in a frame @xmath are determined from the
metric, the torsion, the metricity and the unholonomicity objects
(equivalently the commutators) of the frame vectors

2. The symmetric part @xmath of @xmath depends on all fields. This means
that the geodesics and the autoparallels in a given frame depend on the
geometric properties of the space (fields @xmath @xmath and the
unholonomicity of the frame (field @xmath

3. The antisymmetric part @xmath of @xmath depends only on the fields
@xmath and @xmath

4. The objects of unholonomicity @xmath behave in the same way as the
components of the torsion. This means that even in a Riemannian space
where @xmath in an unholonomic basis the antisymmetric part @xmath This
result has lead to the misunderstanding that when one works in an
unholonomic frame then one has introduced torsion, which is not correct!
This is the case with the TEGR. This misunderstanding has important
consequences because the effects one will observe in an unholonomic
frame will be frame dependent effects and not covariant effects.
Therefore all conclusions made in a specific unholonomic frame are
restricted to that frame only.

#### 11.3 @xmath-gravity

Teleparallelism uses as dynamical objects special unholonomic frames in
spacetime, called vierbeins, which are defined by the requirement

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.15)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the Lorentz metric in canonical form. Obviously @xmath
where @xmath is the dual basis. Differing from GR, which uses the
torsionless Levi-Civita connection, Teleparallelism utilizes the
curvatureless Weitzenböck connection [ 175 ] , where Weitzenböck
non-null torsion is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.16)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Notice that we assume that the Ricci rotation coefficients obey @xmath
and encompass all the information concerning the gravitational field.
The TEGR Lagrangian for the gravitational field equations (Einstein
equations) is taken to be:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.17)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.18)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and @xmath is the tensor

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.19)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which equals the difference of the Levi Civita connection in the
holonomic and the unholonomic frame.

In this work the gravitational field will be driven by a Lagrangian
density which is a function of @xmath . Therefore, the corresponding
action of @xmath gravity reads as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.20)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath and @xmath is Newton’s constant. TEGR and thus General
Relativity is restored when @xmath . First of all, in order to construct
a realistic cosmology we have to incorporate the matter and radiation
sectors too. Therefore, the total action is written as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.21)
  -- -------- -- ---------

If matter couples to the metric in the standard form then the variation
of the action ( 11.21 ) with respect to the vierbein leads to the
equations [ 180 ]

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (11.22)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath , @xmath
and @xmath is the matter energy-momentum tensor.

#### 11.4 Generalized Lagrangian formulation of @xmath gravity

In this section, we provide a generalized Lagrangian formulation in
order to construct a theory of @xmath gravity. Specifically, the
gravitational field is driven by the Lagrangian density @xmath in (
11.20 ), which can be generalized through the use of a Lagrange
multiplier. In particular, we can write it as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.23)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath , @xmath is the Lagrange multiplier and @xmath is a second
rank tensor which is related to the frame [one can use @xmath ] of the
background spacetime. In the same lines, the Hamiltonian of the system
is written as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.24)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In this case, the system is autonomous hence @xmath is a Noether
symmetry with corresponding Noether integral the Hamiltonian @xmath .

In this framework, considering @xmath as the canonical variables of the
configuration space, we can derive, after some algebra, the general
field equations of @xmath gravity. Indeed, starting from the Lagrangian
( 11.23 ), the Euler-Lagrange equations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.25)
  -- -------- -- ---------

give rise to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.26)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.27)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The functions @xmath are considered to be the Christoffel symbols for
the metric @xmath . Therefore, the system is determined by the two
independent differential equations ( 11.26 ),( 11.27 ) and the
Hamiltonian constraint @xmath where @xmath is given by equation ( 11.24
) and @xmath @xmath are the components of the energy momentum tensor
@xmath .

The point-like Lagragian ( 11.23 ) determines completely the related
dynamical system in the minisuperspace @xmath , implying that one can
easily recover some well known cases of cosmological interest. In brief,
these are:

-   The static spherically symmetric spacetime:

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (11.28)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    arising from the diagonal vierbein ¹ ¹ 1 Note that, in general, one
    can choose a non-diagonal vierbein, giving rise to the same metric
    through ( 11.15 ).

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (11.29)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    where @xmath and @xmath are functions which need to be determined.
    Therefore, the line element of @xmath and @xmath are given by

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (11.30)
      -- -------- -- ---------

-   The flat FRW spacetime with Cartesian coordinates:

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (11.31)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    arising from the vierbein

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (11.32)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    where @xmath is the cosmic time and @xmath is the scale factor of
    the universe. In this case we have

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (11.33)
      -- -------- -- ---------

-   The Bianchi type I spacetime:

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (11.34)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    arising from the vierbein

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (11.35)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    In this case, we obtain

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (11.36)
      -- -------- -- ---------

In the present work we will focus on the static spherically-symmetric
metric deriving new spherically symmetric solutions for @xmath gravity.
In particular, we look for Noether symmetries in order to reveal the
existence of analytical solutions.

#### 11.5 The Noether Symmetry Approach for @xmath gravity

The aim is now to apply the Noether Symmetry Approach to a general class
of @xmath gravity models where the corresponding Lagrangian of the field
equations is given by equation ( 11.23 ). First of all, we perform the
analysis for arbitrary spacetimes, and then we focus on the spatially
flat FRW spacetime and on the static spherically-symmetric spacetime.

##### 11.5.1 Searching for Noether point symmetries in general
spacetimes

The Noether symmetry condition for Lagrangian ( 11.23 ) is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.37)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Notice that the Lagrangian ( 11.51 ) is a singular Lagrangian (the
Hessian vanishes), hence the jet space is @xmath and thus the first
prolongation of @xmath in the jet space @xmath is [ 103 , 181 , 182 ]

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
                 (11.38)
  -- -------- -- ---------

For each term of the Noether condition ( 11.37 ) for the Lagrangian (
11.23 ) we obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Inserting these expressions into ( 11.37 ) we find the Noether symmetry
conditions

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.39)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.40)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.41)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.42)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Conditions @xmath imply, through equation ( 11.40 ), that @xmath . Also,
equation ( 11.42 ) takes the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.43)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the Lie derivative with respect to the vector field
@xmath . Furthermore, from ( 11.43 ) we deduce that @xmath is a CKV of
the metric @xmath , with conformal factor

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.44)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Finally, utilizing simultaneously equations ( 11.41 ), ( 11.43 ), (
11.44 ) and the condition @xmath , we rewrite ( 11.41 ) as

  -- -- -- ---------
           (11.45)
  -- -- -- ---------

Considering that @xmath and using the condition @xmath , we acquire
@xmath with @xmath . At this point, we have to deal with the following
two situations:

Case 1. In the case of @xmath , the symmetry conditions are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (11.46)
  -- -------- -- ---------

implying that the vector @xmath is a homothetic Vector of the metric
@xmath . The latter means that for arbitrary @xmath functional forms,
the dynamical system could possibly admit extra (time independent)
Noether symmetries.

Case 2. If @xmath then equation ( 11.45 ) leads to the differential
equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.47)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which has the solution

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.48)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In this context, @xmath is a CKV of @xmath , and the symmetry conditions
become

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (11.49)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath .

Collecting the above results we have the following result

###### Lemma 11.5.1

The general autonomous Lagrangian

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

admits extra Noether point symmetries as follows

a) If @xmath is an arbitrary function of @xmath , then the symmetry
vector is written as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is a HV/KV of the metric @xmath and the following condition
holds

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

b) If @xmath is a power law, i.e. @xmath , then we have the extra
symmetry vector

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath , @xmath is a CKV of the metric @xmath with conformal
factor @xmath and the following condition holds

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath .

In both cases the corresponding gauge function is a constant.

In the following we apply the above Lemma in the case of FRW cosmology
and static spherical symmetric spacetimes.

#### 11.6 Spatially flat FRW

The FRW in the holonomic (commoving) frame @xmath has the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the cosmological scale factor. In this spacetime we
define the vierbein (unholonomic frame) @xmath with the requirement:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.50)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In order to derive the cosmological equations in a FRW metric, we need
to deduce a point-like Lagrangian from the action ( 11.20 ). As a
consequence, the infinite number of degrees of freedom of the original
field theory will be reduced to a finite number. In this framework
considering @xmath as canonical variables the corresponding @xmath
Lagrangian becomes:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.51)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Therefore the field equations are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.52)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.53)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.54)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the Hubble parameter, @xmath and @xmath are the total
energy density and (isotropic) pressure respectively, which are measured
in the unholonomic frame. It is interesting to mention that using the
conservation equation @xmath one can rewrite equations ( 11.53 ) and (
11.54 ) in the usual form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.55)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.56)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.57)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.58)
  -- -------- -- ---------

are the unholonomicity contributions to the energy density and pressure.
Finally, a basic question here is the following: under which
circumstances @xmath gravity can resemble that of the scalar field dark
energy? In order to address this crucial question we need to calculate
the effective equation-of-state parameter @xmath for the @xmath
cosmology. Indeed, utilizing equations ( 11.57 ) and ( 11.58 ), we can
easily obtain the effective unholonomicity equation of state as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.59)
  -- -------- -- ---------

##### 11.6.1 Noether symmetries

From Lemma 11.5.1 for the Lagrangian ( 11.51 ) we find that for

-   For arbitrary @xmath the Lagrangian ( 11.51 ) admits only the
    Noether symmetry @xmath

-   For @xmath where @xmath is the integration constant we have the
    following extra Noether symmetries:
    - For @xmath the Noether point symmetry vector is

      -- -------- -------- -------- --
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                           @xmath   
      -- -------- -------- -------- --

    with corresponding Noether integral

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    where @xmath .
    - For @xmath the Noether point symmetry is

      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (11.60)
                                    @xmath   
      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

    with corresponding Noether integral

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    - For @xmath the Noether point symmetry becomes

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    with Noether integral

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

We would like to stress that our results are in agreement with those of
[ 147 ] but they are richer because we have considered the term @xmath
in the generator which is not done in [ 147 ] . To this end it becomes
evident that @xmath is the only form that admits extra Noether point
symmetries implying the existence of exact analytical solutions.

##### 11.6.2 Exact cosmological solutions

In this section we proceed in an attempt to analytically solve the basic
cosmological equations of the @xmath gravity model. In particular from
the Lagrangian ( 11.51 ) we obtain the main field equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.61)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Also differentiating equation ( 11.52 ) we find

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.62)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Finally, inserting @xmath , @xmath , equation ( 11.52 ) and equation(
11.62 ) into equation( 11.61 ) we derive after some algebra that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.63)
  -- -------- -- ---------

a solution of which is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.64)
  -- -------- -- ---------

or

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.65)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath is the Hubble parameter. We note that
the above analytic solution confirms that of [ 147 ] .

From equation( 11.64 ) it is evident that this cosmological models have
no inflection point (that is the deceleration parameter does not change
sign). Therefore, the main drawback of the @xmath gravity model is that
the deceleration parameter preserves sign, and therefore the universe
always accelerates or always decelerates depending on the value of
@xmath . Indeed, if we consider @xmath (TEGR) then the above solution
boils down to the Einstein de Sitter model as it should. On the other
hand, the accelerated expansion of the universe ( @xmath ) is recovered
for @xmath . The latter means that even if we admit @xmath as a mere
phenomenological possibility, we would be also admitting that the
universe has been accelerating forever, which is of course difficult to
accept.

##### 11.6.3 Cosmological analogue to other models

In this section (assuming flatness) we present the cosmological
equivalence at the background level between the current @xmath gravity
with @xmath modified gravity and dark energy, through a specific
reconstruction of the @xmath and vacuum energy density namely, @xmath
and @xmath . In particular, in the case of @xmath it has been found (see
chapter 10 ) that the corresponding scale factor obeys equation ( 11.64
), where @xmath . ² ² 2 The Lagrangian here is @xmath , where @xmath is
the Ricci scalar. For @xmath the solution of the Euler-Lagrange
equations is the Einstein de-Sitter model [ @xmath ] as it should. Note,
that for @xmath one can find a de-Sitter solution [ @xmath , see chapter
10 ].

On the other hand, considering a spatially flat FRW metric and in the
context of GR the combination of the Friedmann equations with the total
(matter+vacuum) energy conservation in the matter dominated era,
provides (for more details see [ 183 , 184 ] )

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.66)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Solving equation ( 11.66 ) for @xmath (see [ 185 , 186 , 187 ] ) we end
up with

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.67)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Now, comparing equations ( 11.65 ), ( 11.67 ) and connecting the above
coefficients as @xmath , we find that the @xmath and the flat @xmath
models can be viewed as equivalent cosmologies as far as the Hubble
expansion is concerned, despite the fact that the time varying vacuum
model is inside GR. However, when the @xmath cosmological model is
confronted with the current observations it provides a poor fit [ 183 ,
184 ] . Because the current time varying vacuum model shares exactly the
same Hubble parameter with the @xmath gravity model, it follows that the
latter is also under observational pressure when compared against the
background cosmological data. The same observational situation holds
also for the @xmath modified gravity.

#### 11.7 Static spherically symmetric spacetimes

We apply now the results of the general Noether analysis of the previous
subsection, to the specific case of static spherically-symmetric
geometry given by the  metric ( 11.28 ), that is the vierbein ( 11.29 ).
Armed with the general expressions provided above, we can deduce the
Noether algebra of the metric ( 11.28 ).

In this metric the Lagrangian ( 11.23 ) and the Hamiltonian ( 11.24 )
become

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.68)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.69)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is given by ( 11.30 ). As one can immediately deduce, TEGR
and thus General Relativity is restored when @xmath , while if @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath we fully recover the standard Schwarzschild solution.

Applying Lemma 11.5.1 in the case of static spherically-symmetric
geometry, we determine all the functional forms of @xmath for which the
above dynamical system admits Noether point symmetries beyond the
trivial one @xmath We summarize the results in Tables 11.1 , 11.2 and
11.3 . Furthermore, we can use the obtained Noether integrals in order
to classify the analytic solutions for each case.

In the case of @xmath we have the additional extra Noether symmetries of
Table 11.1

##### 11.7.1 Exact Solutions

Using the Noether symmetries and the corresponding integral of motions
obtained in the previous section, we can extract all the static
spherically-symmetric solutions of @xmath gravity. Without loss of
generality, we choose the conformal factor @xmath as @xmath [or
equivalently ⁴ ⁴ 4 Since the space is empty, the field equations are
conformally invariant, therefore the resutls are similar for an
arbitrary function @xmath (see chapter 9 ) @xmath ]. In order to
simplify the current dynamical problem, we consider the coordinate
transformation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.70)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Substituting the above variables into the field equations ( 11.26 ), (
11.27 ), ( 11.69 ) we immediately obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.71)
     @xmath      (11.72)
     @xmath      (11.73)
  -- -------- -- ---------

while the torsion scalar is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.74)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Finally, the generalized Lagrangian ( 11.23 ) acquires the simple form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.75)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Since the analysis of the previous subsection revealed two classes of
Noether symmetries, namely for arbitrary @xmath , and @xmath , in the
following subsections we investigate them separately.

###### Arbitrary @xmath

In the case where @xmath is arbitrary, a special solution of the system
( 11.71 )-( 11.74 ) is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (11.76)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (11.77)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

and the Hamiltonian constraint ( @xmath ) reads

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.78)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath , and @xmath are integration constants. Utilizing ( 11.70
), ( 11.76 ) and ( 11.77 ), we get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (11.79)
  -- -------- -- ---------

For convenience, we can change variables from @xmath to @xmath according
to the transformation @xmath , where @xmath denotes the radial variable.
Inserting this into the above equations, we conclude that the spacetime
( 11.28 ) in the coordinates @xmath can be written as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.80)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.81)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.82)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In these expressions we have @xmath , @xmath and @xmath is a
characteristic radius with the restriction @xmath .

We observe that if we select the constant @xmath then we retain the
Schwarzschild-like metric. On the other hand, the function @xmath can be
viewed as a distortion factor which quantifies the smooth deviation from
the pure Schwarzschild solution. Thus, the @xmath gravity on small
spherical scales ( @xmath ) tends to create a Schwarzschild solution. In
particular, the @xmath spherical solution admits singularity only at
@xmath , which is also the case with the usual Schwarzschild solution.

Within this framework, for commoving observers, @xmath , it is easy to
show that the Einstein’s tensor becomes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Therefore, from the 1+3 decomposition of @xmath we define the fluid
physical parameters

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
                       @xmath            (11.85)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (11.86)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.87)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is the anisotropic stress tensor and @xmath is the @xmath projection
tensor defined by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.88)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Furthermore the fluid is also anisotropic @xmath ) but not heat
conducting @xmath

In order to apply the above considerations for specific @xmath forms, we
consider the following viable @xmath models, motivated by cosmology ⁵ ⁵
5 The @xmath models of Refs. [ 188 , 189 ] are consistent with the
cosmological data.

-   Exponential @xmath gravity [ 189 ] :

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    where @xmath and @xmath are the two model parameters which are
    connected via ( 11.78 )

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

-   A sum of two different power law @xmath gravity:

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    where from ( 11.78 ) we have

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    Note that in the case of @xmath we recover the @xmath model by
    Bengochea & Ferraro [ 188 ] .

###### @xmath

In the @xmath case, the field equations ( 11.26 ), ( 11.27 ), ( 11.69 )
and the torsion scalar ( 11.74 ) give rise to the following dynamical
system:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.89)
     @xmath      (11.90)
     @xmath      (11.91)
     @xmath      (11.92)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It is easy to show that combining equation ( 11.89 ) with the
Hamiltonian ( 11.90 ), we can impose constraints on the value of @xmath
, namely @xmath . Under this condition, solving the system of equations
( 11.91 ) and ( 11.92 ) we arrive at the solutions

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.93)
     @xmath      (11.94)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the integration constant. Now using ( 11.70 ) we derive
@xmath , @xmath as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.95)
     @xmath      (11.96)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Using the coordinate transformation @xmath , which implies @xmath [with
@xmath ], and using simultaneously ( 11.95 ), the spherical metric (
11.28 ) can be written as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.97)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.98)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.99)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Furthermore, considering the commoving observers @xmath , we can write
the Einstein tensor components as

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where @xmath and @xmath .

Similarly, based on the equalities ( 11.85 )-( 11.87 ), we compute the
following fluid parameters

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (11.100)
  -- -------- -- ----------

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (11.101)
  -- -------- -- ----------

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

#### 11.8 Conclusion

In this chapter we studied the Noether symmetries of @xmath gravity.  We
proved that for some diagonal frames the Lagrangian of the field
equations admits Noether symmetries for arbitrary @xmath function.
However, in the case of power law @xmath , i.e. @xmath it is possible
the Lagrangian to admits extra Noether symmetries. We applied this
results in order to classify the Noether symmetries of the field
equations in a spatially flat FRW spacetime and in a static spherical
symmetric spacetime. For each background spacetime we found analytical
solutions of the field equations.

### Chapter 12 Discussion

#### 12.1 Discussion

In this thesis we study the Lie point symmetries and the Noether point
symmetries of second order differential equations usinng a geometric
approach and we apply the results to systems which are relevant to
relativistic physics.

In particular, we have studied the point symmetries of the equations of
motion of dynamical systems in a Riemannian space with Lagrangian

  -- -- -- --------
           (12.1)
  -- -- -- --------

where @xmath is the metric of the space  and we proved that the Lie
point symmetries of the Euler-Lagrange equations, i.e. @xmath of
Lagrangian ( 12.1 ) are generated from the elements of the special
Projective algebra of the Riemannian manifold with metric @xmath whereas
the Noether point symmetries are generated from the homothetic algebra
of the space with metric @xmath . Therefore we have transfer the problem
of determination of the Lie/Noether symmetries of differential equations
to the determination of the collineations of the underlying manifold;
hence, we are able to use the plethora of existing results of
differential geometry.

We have applied this geometric approach in many directions. In
particular, we have classified the Lie and the Noether symmetries of the
geodesic Lagrangian for some important spacetimes, such as the FRW
spacetime, the Gödel space, the Taub space and the 1+3 decomposable
spacetimes. Moreover we proved that for Einstein spaces the point
symmetries of the geodesic equations are generated from the elements of
the Killing algebra of the metric.

Furthermore we have determined all the two and the three dimensional
Newtonian systems which admit Lie and Noether point symmetries. We note
that, due to the geometric derivation and the tabular presentation, the
results can be extended easily to higher dimensional flat spaces. We
applied these results in the study of the symmetries of the Hènon -
Heiles potential and of the Kepler-Ermakov potential in a two
dimensional space. Moreover, we determined the potentials which admit
Noether symmetries in a two dimensional sphere @xmath .

We proved that a dynamical system admits as Lie symmetries the @xmath
Lie algebra if and only if the underlying manifold admits a gradient
Homothetic vector. The Newtonian system which is invariant under the Lie
group @xmath is the well known Kepler-Ermakov system. Therefore, the
requirement for a dynamical system with Lagrangian of the form of ( 12.1
) to admit as Lie and Noether symmetries the generators of the @xmath
Lie algebra leads us to the generalization of the Newotian
Kepler-Ermakov system in a Riemannian manifold; that is, we found that
the general autonomous Kepler-Ermakov system follows from the Lagrangian

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (12.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

In additionally, we studied the Liouville integrability of the three
dimensional Newtonian Kepler-Ermakov via Noether point symmetries and we
investigated the application of Lagrangian ( 12.2 ) in dynamical systems
emerging from alternative theories of gravity. In particular we showed
that the field equations in a Bianchi I spacetime for an exponential
scalar field and for @xmath gravity when @xmath follow from Lagrangians
of the form of ( 12.2 ) and for these models we proved that the field
equations are Liouville integrable.

Concerning the second order partial differential equations we considered
equations of the generic form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (12.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

and we proved a theorem which relates the Lie pont symmetries of
equation ( 12.3 ) with the elements of the Conformal Killing vectors of
the second order tensor @xmath (considered to be a metric). We have
applied this result in order to study the Lie point symmetries of the
Heat equation and the Poisson equation. It has been shown that the Lie
symmetries of the Heat equation follow from the Killing and the
homothetic algebras of @xmath whereas the Lie symmetries of the Poisson
equation follow from the Killing, the homothetic and the conformal
algebras of @xmath In each case we have determoned the form of the Lie
symmetry vectors.

Furthermore, we have determined the Lie symmetries of the Schrödinger
equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (12.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the Klein Gordon equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (12.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

in a general Riemannian space. It has been shown that these symmetries
are related to the Noether symmetries of the classical Lagrangian for
which the metric @xmath is the kinematic metric. More precisely, for the
Schrödinger equation ( 12.4 ) it has been shown that if a KV or a HV of
the metric @xmath produces a Lie symmetry for the Schrödinger equation,
then it produces a Noether symmetry for the Classical Lagrangian in the
space with metric @xmath and potential @xmath . For the Klein Gordon
equation ( 12.5 ) the situation is different; the Lie symmetries of the
Klein Gordon are generated by the elements of the conformal group of the
metric @xmath The KVs and the HV of this group produce a Noether
symmetry of the classical Lagrangian with a constant gauge function.
However the proper CKVs produce a Noether symmetry for the conformal
Lagrangian if there exists a conformal factor @xmath such that the CKV
becomes a KV/HV of @xmath .

We have applied these results to three cases of practical interest: the
motion in a central potential, the classification of all potentials in
two and three dimensional Euclidian spaces for which the Schrödinger
equation and the Klein Gordon equation admit a Lie symmetry and finally
we have considered the Lie symmetries of the Klein Gordon equation in
the static, spherically symmetric empty spacetime. In the last case, we
have demonstrated the role of the Lie symmetries and that of the
conformal Lagrangians in the determination of the closed form solution
of Einstein equations. Furthermore, we investigated the Lie point
symmetries of the null Hamilton Jacobi equation and we proved that if a
CKV generates a point symmetry for the Klein Gordon equation, then it
also generates a point symmetry for the null Hamilton Jacobi equation.

We also studied the problem of Type II hidden symmetries of second order
partial differential equations in @xmath dimensional Riemannian spaces
from a geometric of view. We have considered the reduction of the
Laplace and of the homogeneous heat equation and the consequent
possibility of existence of Type II hidden symmetries in some general
classes of spaces which admit some kind of symmetry; hence, they admit
nontrivial Lie symmetries.

The Type II hidden symmetries of Laplace equation are directly related
to the transition of the CKVs from the space where the original equation
is defined to the space where the reduced equation resides. In this
sense, we related the Lie symmetries of PDEs with the basic
collineations of the metric i.e. the CKVs.

Concerning the Type II hidden symmetries of the homogeneous heat
equation we considered the problem in the spaces which admit a gradient
KV or a gradient HV and finally spacetime which admits a HV which acts
simply and transitively. For the reduction of the homogeneous heat
equation and the existence of Type II hidden symmetries, we found the
following general geometric results: (a) If we reduce the homogeneous
heat equation via the symmetries which are generated by a gradient KV
@xmath the reduced equation is a heat equation in the nondecomposable
space. In this case we have the Type II hidden symmetry @xmath provided
if we reduce the heat equation with the symmetry @xmath . (b) If we
reduce the homogeneous heat equation via the symmetries which are
generated by a gradient HV the reduced equation is Laplace equation for
an appropriate metric. In this case the Type II hidden symmetries are
generated from the proper CKVs and (c) in Petrov type III spacetime, the
reduction of the homogeneous heat equation via the symmetry generated
from the nongradient HV gives PDE that inherit the Lie symmetries, hence
no Type II hidden symmetries are admitted.

Finally, we applied the point symmetries and especially the Noether
point symmetries in modified theories of gravity in order to probe the
nature of dark energy. We used the Noether symmetries as a geometric
criterion or ”selection rule” in order to select the scalar field
potential in scalar-tensor theories, and the functions @xmath and @xmath
in the corresponding alternative theories of gravity.

In the context of scalar-tensor cosmology we have found that to every
non-minimally coupled scalar field, we can associate a unique minimally
coupled scalar field in a conformally related space with an appropriate
potential. This result can be used in order to study the dynamical
properties of the various cosmological models, since the field equations
of a non-minimally coupled scalar field are the same, at the conformal
level, with the field equations of the minimally coupled scalar field.
Furthermore, we have identified the Noether point symmetries and the
analytic solutions of the equations of motion in the context of a
minimally coupled and a non minimally coupled scalar field in a FRW
spacetime and we have classified the Noether point symmetries of the
field equations in Bianchi class A models with a minimally coupled
scalar field. We find that there is a rather large class of hyperbolic
and exponential potentials which admit extra (beyond the @xmath )
Noether symmetries which lead to integral of motions. For these
potentials we used the corresponding Noether integrals in order to solve
analytically the field equations and find the functional form of the
scalar factor.

Concerning the @xmath models we applied the Noether point symmetries
with the aim to utilize the existence of non-trivial Noether symmetries
as a selection criterion that can distinguish the @xmath models on a
more fundamental level. We proved that in a spatially flat FRW
background the @xmath theories which admit Noether point symmetries are
the @xmath and @xmath . The last two functional forms of the @xmath
function admit Noether point symmetries also in the case of a non
spatially flat FRW background. It is interesting to note that the @xmath
models are equivalent with the Newtonian Kepler-Ermakov system whereas
the @xmath models are equivalent with the anisotropic hyperbolic
oscillator. For these functional forms we use the Noether integrals in
order to find exact solutions of the modified field equations.

Furthermore, in @xmath gravity we have proved a Lemma that for diagonal
frames the only functional form of @xmath which admits extra Noether
symmetries is the @xmath .  We applied this functional form in a
spatially flat FRW background and we determined the analytic solution of
the field equations for each case. Finally, we studied the field
equations for the @xmath model in a static spherically symmetric
spacetime and we determined a family of analytic solutions.

The geometric approach is a new method for studying the symmetries of
differential equations and has shown that gives directly results by
using only the results (usually existing) of differential geometry
without the need to use of a computer library in order to determine the
Lie or the Noether point symmetries. This approach implies a better
understanding of the nature of symmetries and of the conservation laws
and can be used in order to find analogues of classical Newtonian
systems in relativistic physics. It is of interest that this method
would be extendented in other classes of differential equations and in
other transformations which are not necessary point transformations.
Concerning the applications in Cosmology, it is of interest the
classification of modified theories of gravity with geometric selection
rules. In this thesis we studied some of the basic modified theories of
gravity; however there are other more such theories which could be
studied further either by means of point symmetries or by some new
geometric criteria.
