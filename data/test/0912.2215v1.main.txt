##### Abstract

We are now going to apply deformation theory to the physical part of the
@xmath black hole. The first idea was to deform the @xmath of @xmath and
to deform @xmath by action of this group (see section A.4 for an
introduction to deformation by group action). We show in section 3.2
that this procedure is possible.

Instead of that, we will only deform an open orbit of @xmath in the four
dimensional case ¹ ¹ 1 But the structure of algebra ( B.59 ), promises
easy higher dimension generalisation. . There are two reasons for that.
First a physical domain of the black hole is contained in an open orbit
of @xmath ; and second it reveals possible to deform such a domain by
action of a four dimensional group. Deforming a four dimensional space
by a four dimensional group instead of a six dimensional one is a matter
of “no waste” of dimensions.

The main lines of the construction are the following:

-   We pick an open orbit @xmath of @xmath in @xmath , and we select a
    point @xmath .

-   We compute the stabilizer @xmath of @xmath in @xmath , in such a way
    that, as homogeneous space, @xmath . We consider the “remaining
    group” @xmath of @xmath when one removes @xmath from @xmath .

-   We prove that @xmath acts freely and transitively on @xmath , so
    that @xmath is globally of group type (definition 2.1 ).

-   It turns out that @xmath does not accept any symplectic structure;
    hence we will search for other groups acting transitively on @xmath
    , and show that one and only one of them accepts a symplectic
    structure.

-   The latter group turns out to be a split extension of an Heisenberg
    group (see appendix A.5 ) for which we know a deformation.

###### Abstract

This chapter contains two directions that were explored during my thesis
and that were not finished for different reasons.

In the first section, we state a result of Unterberger in [ 25 ] which
provides a deformation of the complex half-plane, and we show how to
translate it as a new noncommutative product on the group @xmath , i.e.
the Iwasawa subgroup of @xmath . The technique of deformation by group
action described in appendix A.4 then induces a deformed product on the
dual of its Lie algebra. We do not study the properties (symmetries,
maximal functional space of convergence, symplectic condition to be a
true quantization, …) of this product, but we show that Unterberger’s
result assures the existence of at least one good functional space.
Unfortunately the formula reveals not to be universal; we show the lack
of universality on two examples of actions of the group @xmath on @xmath
. The failure is due to divergences of the derivatives of the functions
@xmath (see equation ( A.89 )).

This study is motivated by the fact that recent work (not published yet)
of P. Bieliavsky provides an universal deformation of the @xmath of
@xmath . We are thus allowed to say that the latter new product is
“better” than the one of Unterberger. We do not address the question to
know the precise point that makes the lack of universality in
Unterberger.

The second section is an application of the extension lemma (lemma A.19
). We show that all the ingredients needed to deform the @xmath of
@xmath are present. The idea was to deform the @xmath black hole using
the action of the so-deformed @xmath . That should provide an
alternative way to deform @xmath to the one presented in chapter 2 , and
a quantization of @xmath using the same group as the group which defines
a black hole. That method would use the deformation by group action
machinery described in appendix A.4 . The arising question is naturally
to know if that quantization is in some sense equivalent to the one
given in chapter 2 or not. That question is not answered yet.

###### Abstract

Deformation is a main theme of research in the present work. We begin
here to describe WKB quantization and a general method to guess
deformations of function algebras. The role of Darboux charts and
momentum maps appears clearly. A careful example is given by the
deformation of @xmath .

We prove a useful result (from [ 16 ] ), the extension lemma, which
allows to deform a split extension when one knows a deformation of the
two components of the extension. The kernel is simply the product of the
two kernels.

Then we see the principle of deformation by group action: when a Lie
group is deformable, one can find a deformation of any manifold on which
the group acts. Universal formulas exist in some cases. This is why
deformations of groups are studied. An application of that extension
lemma to the Iwasawa subgroup of @xmath is given in chapter 3 .

###### Abstract

This section shows in some detail an instructive example of deformation
of an Iwasawa subgroup: the Iwasawa subgroup of @xmath . In this section
we will use the parametrization ( B.22 ) of @xmath , as well as the
notations @xmath and @xmath . Here are the main steps that will be
performed:

1.  The Iwasawa component @xmath provides a double covering onto @xmath
    where @xmath is any element of @xmath (which is one dimensional).
    The adjoint orbit @xmath being endowed with a canonical symplectic
    form described in subsection B.12.4 , we consider on @xmath the
    corresponding symplectic structure.

2.  The map @xmath turns out to be a global Darboux chart and induces
    the diffeomorphism

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    Under these identifications, the adjoint action of @xmath on @xmath
    becomes the simple multiplication of @xmath in itself, which is
    strongly hamiltonian.

3.  The Moyal product is @xmath -covariant for the action of @xmath on
    @xmath .

4.  We explicitly build the intertwining operator between @xmath and
    @xmath and we write down a product (see proposition A.8 ).

5.  A theorem is stated in which we list the properties of the so
    constructed product.

## Introduction

The question arises when one watches movies such as Star Trek: what is a
black hole ? One knows from special relativity that light speed cannot
be exceeded. So, as a first attempt to define the notion of black hole,
we just say that it is a region of the space from which even light
cannot escape. Such an object causes a scientific problem because it is
by assumption not observable. This fact allows science-fiction writers
to invent anything without any chance of contradiction. That is a Star
Trek black hole.

Physical black holes are much more interesting because they are the
signal of a general relativity failure.

The Newtonian gravitational field is given by a potential which
increases as @xmath when you get closer to a massive object. At @xmath ,
this potential makes no sense and physics is in trouble. One can avoid
the problem by postulating that there exist no pointwise masses and that
particles cannot penetrate each other. From these assumptions, the fact
that Newtonian mechanics does not impose any limit speed makes the
divergence at @xmath unimportant.

In general relativity, the divergence at small distances is much more
problematic because there is a limit speed; hence a pointwise mass
always creates a whole region from which nothing (not even light) can
escape. Worse: even a homogeneous ball produces a divergence in the
metric when it is too dense, and such objects may exist in the real
world. Stated in a more mathematical way: solutions of Einstein’s
equations for the real world may be singular. From this point of view,
black holes are nothing else than a feature in the mathematical
framework of relativity which indicates that this is not a final theory.
That is the notion of black hole in general relativity and in cosmology.

The transfer of concept from physics to mathematics always consists in
taking the key features of the mathematical framework of a physical
theory and posing them as definition of a new mathematical object. What
are the main mathematical points in the concept of black hole in general
relativity ? First, we retain the notion of pseudo-Riemannian manifold.
The sign of the norm of a vector is the crucial property which allows
one to define causality (the light cone).

The second main feature that we extract from the physical situation is
the fact that a general relativity black hole has a non empty interior.
We saw that this is the key difference between the Newtonian case in
which all points are equivalent except the unique point where the mass
lies, and the general relativistic case in which a whole region was
causally disconnected from the rest of the space.

More precisely, as mathematicians, we ask a black hole to separate the
pseudo-Riemannian manifold into two causally disconnected parts in the
sense that no light-like geodesics can reach the second region from the
first one. Notice that we do not include metric singularity in our
mathematical black hole notion. In cosmology, in contrast, black holes
always take root in a divergence of some metric invariant such as the
curvature.

The anti de Sitter space is a solution of Einstein’s equations with
constant negative curvature. We consider this space as our framework.
First, we define as singular the closed orbits of the action of some
subgroup of the isometry group @xmath of anti de Sitter. This is done in
such a way to generalize to any dimensions the celebrated BTZ black
hole. Then we prove that the resulting structure is a black hole in the
sense that it cuts the space into two parts : an interior region from
which every light-like geodesic intersects the singularity and an
exterior region in which every point accepts at least one light-like
geodesics which does not intersect the singularity. Notice that our
black hole does not present any curvature singularity.

The second theme of this thesis is deformation quantization. The key
ingredient of quantum mechanics is the noncommutativity of quantum
observables. When one tries to measure the velocity and the position of
a classical particle (such as a tennis ball or a planet), one can choose
the order of measurement. It does not matter which of velocity or
position is measured first. Quantum mechanics (the mechanics which
governs subatomic particles) is very different. If you measure the
position of an electron and then you measure its velocity, you do not
get the same result as if you had measured the velocity first and then
the position. That noncommutativity in measurements is the very
foundation of the quantum mechanics. In the usual mathematical
framework, it is implemented by describing each measurable quantity by
an operator acting on a Hilbert space. The eigenvalues of these
operators correspond to physical measurements. The position and momentum
operators for example are respectively @xmath and @xmath . These two
operators obviously do not commute.

In a more abstract way, we say that noncommutativity of quantum
mechanics is implemented by considering some noncommutative algebra of
operators acting on a Hilbert space, while the classical mechanics deals
with observables that are usual functions that form a commutative
algebra. The procedure to pass from commutative function algebras to
noncommutative operator algebras is the so-called quantization in
physics.

In our sense ⁶ ⁶ 6 Quantization is a very large field of mathematics; as
far I know, the idea of noncommutativity is always present, but precise
notion of “to quantize something” may vary from one subject to another ,
deforming a manifold is simply putting a one-parameter family of new
noncommutative products on the set of functions on this manifold. We
impose that it reduces to the usual commutative product when the
parameter goes to zero. In order to speak of quantization , we ask the
first order term in the expansion with respect to the parameter to
somehow “contain” the symplectic structure given on the original
manifold.

Questions that arise in this context are: is it possible to study
causality in a noncommutative framework ? does it apply to real physics
?

The main result of the present work is not to directly address these
large questions, but to build a concrete example in which one can work.
Namely, we consider the anti de Sitter space — that is the simplest non
trivial solution of Einstein’s equations with constant negative
curvature — that we endow with a black hole structure defined from the
action of a subgroup of the isometry group. Then we select the physical
part of the space — the one which is causally connected to infinity —
and we perform a deformation of that part.

The work is divided into three main parts. In a first time (chapter 1 )
we define a “BTZ” black hole in anti de Sitter space in any dimension.
That will be done by means of group theoretical and symmetric spaces
considerations. A physical “good domain” is identified as an open orbit
of a subgroup of the isometry group of anti de Sitter.

Then (chapter 2 ) we show that the open orbit is in fact isomorphic to a
group (we introduce the notion of globally group type manifold) for
which a quantization exists. The quantization of the black hole is
performed and its Dirac operator is computed.

The third part (appendix A and B ) exposes some previously known
results. Appendix A is given in a pedagogical purpose: it exposes
generalities about deformation quantization and careful examples with
@xmath and split extensions of Heisenberg algebras. Appendix B is
devoted to some classical results about homogeneous spaces and Iwasawa
decompositions. Explicit decompositions are given for every algebra that
will be used in the thesis. It serves to make the whole text more self
contained and to fix notations. Basics of quantization by group action
are given in appendix A.4 .

One more chapter is inserted (chapter 3 ). It contains two small results
which have no true interest by themselves but which raise questions and
call for further development. We discuss a product on the half-plane
(or, equivalently, on the Iwasawa subgroup of @xmath ) due to A.
Unterberger. We show that the quantization by group action machinery can
be applied to this product in order to deform the dual of the Lie
algebra of that Iwasawa subgroup. Although this result seems promising,
we show by two examples that the product is not universal in the sense
that even the product of compactly supported functions cannot be defined
on @xmath by the quantization induced by Unterberger’s product.

Then we show that the Iwasawa subgroup of @xmath (i.e. the group which
defines the singularity) is a symplectic split extension of the Iwasawa
subgroup of @xmath by the Iwasawa subgroup of @xmath . A quantization of
the two latter groups being known, a quantization of @xmath is in
principle possible using an extension lemma (subsection A.3 ).
Properties of this product and the resulting quantization of @xmath were
not investigated because we found a more economical way to quantize
@xmath .

## Chapter 1 Black holes in anti de Sitter spaces

### 1.1 Introduction

#### 1.1.1 General ideas of a black hole

The basic notions needed in order to define a causal structure on a time
orientable pseudo-Riemannian manifold are that of time-, light- and
space-like tangent vector. A tangent vector is said to be respectively
time- , space- or light-like when its norm is positive, negative or
null; physically, only time-like vectors are allowed to be the velocity
of an observer (this is the fact that light speed cannot be attained by
a massive particle), and it is only possible for massless particle (such
as photons) to follow trajectories with light-like tangent vectors.

From a geometric point of view, a black hole is the data of a causal
manifold @xmath together with a subset @xmath called singularity such
that the whole manifold is divided into two parts: the interior and the
exterior of the black hole. A point is said to be interior if all future
light-like geodesics through the point have a non empty intersection
with the singularity. A point is exterior if it is not interior. An
important subset of the space is the event horizon : the boundary
between these two subsets.

#### 1.1.2 BTZ black hole

The BTZ black hole introduced and developed by Bañados, Teitelbaum,
Zannelli and Henneaux in [ 1 , 2 ] is an example of a black hole whose
singularity is not motivated by metric divergences ¹ ¹ 1 It turns out
that general relativity accepts a lot of solutions presenting metric
divergences; or more precisely, there are a lot of physical situations
from which Einstein’s equations lead to divergences of some metric
invariant such as the curvature. . The construction is roughly as
follows. We consider the anti de Sitter space in which we pick up a
Killing vector field whose sign of norm is not constant. Then we perform
a discrete quotient along the integral curves of this vector field. Of
course we obtain a lot of closed geodesics. The point is that, in the
region where the Killing vector field is space-like, these closed curves
are space-like. That violates the physical principle of causality. For
that reason, we decree that this region is singular or, equivalently,
that the boundary of this region is singular. The BTZ singularity is
then the loci where the chosen Killing vector field has a vanishing
norm. Since discrete quotients do not affect local structures, the
resulting space remains a solution of the @xmath -dimensional general
relativity with negative cosmological constant ² ² 2 For honesty, we
have to warn the reader that the real world’s cosmological constant has
been measured very small but positive. We also have to point out that
the four dimensional anti de Sitter space is a solution of general
relativity without masses . From a physical point of view, this thesis
has to be seen as a toy model. . In this context one can define
pertinent notions of mass and angular momentum which depend on the
chosen Killing vector field.

In the case of the non-rotating massive BTZ black hole, the structure of
the singularity and the horizon are closely related to the action of a
minimal parabolic (Iwasawa) subgroup of the isometry group of anti de
Sitter, see [ 3 , 4 ] . The whole work on the BTZ black hole and the
fact that it belongs to the class of causal symmetric spaces (for
definitions and some examples, see [ 5 ] ) motivate the following
definition:

###### Definition 1.1.

A causal solvable symmetric black hole is a causal symmetric space where
the closed orbits of minimal parabolic subgroups of its isometry group
define a black hole singularity. See section 1.2 for definitions of
causality and singularity.

#### 1.1.3 Generalization and group setting

The original BTZ black hole was constructed in dimension three, but we
will see in this chapter that, exploiting their group theoretical
description, they can easily be generalized to any dimension, as pointed
out in [ 6 , 7 ] . Notice that higher-dimensional generalizations of the
BTZ construction have been studied in the physics literature, by
classifying the one-parameter isometry subgroups of @xmath , see [ 8 , 9
, 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ] , but these approaches do not exploit the
symmetric space structure of anti de Sitter.

The structure that will be described with full details in next pages may
be summarized as follows. Take @xmath , fix a Cartan involution @xmath
and a @xmath -commuting involutive automorphism @xmath of @xmath such
that the subgroup @xmath of @xmath of the elements fixed by @xmath is
locally isomorphic to @xmath . The quotient space @xmath is a @xmath
-dimensional Lorentzian symmetric space, the anti de Sitter space-time .
We denote by @xmath and @xmath the Lie algebras of @xmath and @xmath .
We have the decomposition @xmath into the @xmath -eigenspace of the
differential at @xmath of @xmath that we denote again by @xmath . We
also consider @xmath , the Cartan decomposition induced by @xmath ; and
@xmath , a @xmath -stable maximally abelian subalgebra of @xmath . A
positive system of roots is chosen and let @xmath be the corresponding
nilpotent subalgebra (see Iwasawa decomposition, theorem B.9 ). Set
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath . Finally denote by @xmath and @xmath the
corresponding analytic subgroups of @xmath . One then has

###### Theorem 1.2.

The @xmath -dimensional anti de Sitter space with @xmath , seen as the
symmetric space @xmath , becomes a causal solvable symmetric black hole,
as defined above, when the closed orbits of the Iwasawa subgroup @xmath
of @xmath and its Cartan conjugated @xmath are said to be singular.
There exists in particular a non empty event horizon. There are finitely
many such closed orbits.

This chapter intends to prove this theorem, and for the sake of
completeness, we also analyze in some detail in section 1.5 the
two-dimensional case, for which the construction does not yield a black
hole structure.

The black hole causal structure is thus completely determined by the
action of a solvable group. This observation gives prominence to
potential embeddings of these spaces in the framework of noncommutative
geometry, in defining noncommutative causal black holes (see also [ 6 ]
) through the existence of universal deformation formulae for solvable
groups actions which have been obtained in the context of
WKB-quantization of symplectic symmetric spaces [ 14 , 15 ] . These
issues are investigated in chapter 2 and in [ 16 ] .

### 1.2 Causality, light cone and related topics

#### 1.2.1 Causality in anti de Sitter spaces

We consider the @xmath -dimensional anti de Sitter space (see appendix
B.9 )

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

According to proposition B.3 , we can only consider the identity
component of @xmath and @xmath instead of full groups. The metric that
we put on @xmath is the one induced from the Killing form of @xmath by
formula ( B.17 ). This metric has a Minkowskian signature, so that we
have natural notions of time-, space- and light-like vectors. From now
we denote by @xmath and @xmath the groups @xmath and @xmath .

The connected group @xmath admits an Iwasawa decomposition @xmath (see
theorem B.9 ). Let @xmath be the @xmath -conjugate ³ ³ 3 Roughly
speaking, it corresponds to different choices in the Iwasawa
decomposition of @xmath . group of @xmath where @xmath is the Cartan
involution of subsection B.7.1 . We will see that the actions of @xmath
and @xmath have closed and open orbits. The closed ones are denoted by
@xmath and @xmath . The following definition is motivated all previously
existing work about BTZ black hole.

###### Definition 1.3.

The singularity in @xmath is the set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

so that a point is singular when it belongs to a closed orbit of @xmath
or @xmath . The black hole is defined as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the (future directed) geodesic in the direction @xmath
starting at @xmath (see equation ( 1.9 ) and the discussion above).

The aim of this chapter is to prove that the so-defined black hole is
non trivial in the sense that the following inclusions are strict:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

In order to get a full definition of the black hole and its structure,
we need to define and characterise the notions of light ray and light
cone. These notions are of course directly issued from physics of
relativity.

###### Definition 1.4.

A light ray is a geodesic whose tangent vector is everywhere light-like.

###### Remark 1.5.

The causal structure of a general pseudo-Riemannian manifold is the fact
that two points are said to be causally connected when there exists a
light ray which passes by both points.

A light ray trough @xmath is given by a vector of @xmath with vanishing
norm. So let us study these vectors. Let @xmath and @xmath , a general
element of @xmath which reads @xmath with @xmath , @xmath and @xmath .
If we pose @xmath , we have @xmath and @xmath . Hence,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath . Under an explicit form, we have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

The exponential @xmath being an element of @xmath , the parameters
@xmath are restricted by the condition @xmath . Remark moreover that
every matrix of @xmath can be written under the form @xmath for a good
choice of @xmath . The light cone is therefore given by the set of
vectors of the form @xmath with @xmath . If we consider the metric
@xmath on @xmath with respect to the basis @xmath , we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This is coherent with the intuitive notion of light cone. It is on the
one hand also true that every light-like vector of @xmath reads @xmath
for some @xmath . On the other hand every nilpotent element of @xmath is
light-like because trace of nilpotent matrix is zero (using Engel’s
theorem). In definitive, we proved the following:

###### Proposition 1.6.

When @xmath is any nilpotent element of @xmath , the set of light-like
vectors of @xmath is parametrized by @xmath with @xmath and @xmath .

Let us point out the fact that only the first column of the “direction”
@xmath has an importance in causality issues. So the word “directions”
will often be used to refer to the vector @xmath . It is not a
particular feature of our particular matrix representation choie. Indeed
the element @xmath only appears in the combination @xmath which is a
light-like vector in @xmath , i.e. @xmath with @xmath for any
orthonormal basis @xmath of @xmath . As far as causality is concerned, a
rescaling @xmath to @xmath has no importance, so one can choice @xmath
and find back @xmath . We see that it is a natural feature that the
light-like rays are parametrized by unital vectors of @xmath .

###### Lemma 1.7.

Let @xmath be a nilpotent element in @xmath , and @xmath , the canonical
projection. A light ray through @xmath has the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

for a certain @xmath .

###### Proof.

General theory of symmetric spaces (see [ 17 ] , pages 230–233,
particularly theorem 3.2) proves that a light ray through @xmath has the
form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In our context, we have the additional request for the tangent vector to
be light-like. Proposition 1.6 thus imposes @xmath to be of the form
@xmath . That proves the claim for geodesics trough @xmath .

The fact that @xmath is an nondegenerate isometry then extends the
result to all points.

∎

###### Corollary 1.8.

If @xmath is nilpotent in @xmath , then @xmath is the set of light-like
vectors in @xmath . Therefore

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

is the light cone of @xmath in @xmath .

In order to fix ideas, we will always use the element @xmath as choice
of nilpotent element in @xmath in order to parametrize light-cone. Since
@xmath acts on @xmath by isometries, the light cone at @xmath is given
by a translation of the one at @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

The product being taken at left while the quotient being taken at right,
one can fear a problem of well definiteness in this expression. The
following proposition shows that all is right.

###### Proposition 1.9.

Definition ( 1.7 ) is independent of the representative @xmath in the
class @xmath . In other words,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

for all @xmath .

###### Proof.

The metric on @xmath is the restriction of the Killing form of @xmath
(notice that @xmath has no own Killing form for the simple reason that
it is not a Lie algebra). From @xmath -invariance, we have in particular

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for all @xmath . The point is that reducibility makes @xmath when @xmath
. The element @xmath in the left hand side of equation ( 1.8 ) being
zero-normed in @xmath , it reads @xmath for some @xmath . That proves
the inclusion in one sense. For the second inclusion, we have to find a
@xmath such that @xmath . Existence of such a @xmath follows from the
fact that @xmath is a light-like vector of @xmath . ∎

#### 1.2.2 Time orientation

A time orientation on @xmath is the choice of a vector @xmath such that
@xmath . When such a choice is made, a vector @xmath is future directed
when @xmath . In our case, the choice is the intuitive one: the vector
@xmath defines the time orientation on @xmath and @xmath is future
directed if and only if @xmath . So a light-like future directed vector
is always –up to a positive multiple– of the form @xmath with @xmath .
For this reason, the set

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

is exactly the set of light-like future-directed vectors of @xmath .

We are now able to define causality as follows. A point @xmath belongs
to the interior region if for every direction @xmath , the future light
ray @xmath intersects the singularity within a finite time. In other
words, it is interior when the whole light cone ends up in the
singularity. A point which is not interior is said to be exterior . A
particularly important set is the event horizon , or simply horizon ,
defined as the boundary of the interior. When a space contains a non
trivial causal structure (i.e. when there exists a non empty horizon),
we say that the definition of singularity gives rise to a black hole .
By extension, the term “black hole” often refers to the set of interior
points.

#### 1.2.3 Some final remarks

Remember that we decree closed orbits to be singular . Now the fact for
a point @xmath to be exterior is that there exists an non empty set
@xmath of @xmath such that @xmath .

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The restriction of the Killing form to @xmath reads

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath               (1.10a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.10b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

So the norm on @xmath is @xmath . The bi-invariance of the Killing form
and the fact that the decomposition @xmath is reductive imply @xmath ,
hence

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

A question is to know the kernel of this inclusion: which @xmath fulfill
@xmath for all @xmath ? The equation @xmath can be simplified (from a
computational point of view) using the relation @xmath which defines
@xmath . It is a somewhat long but easy computation to prove that @xmath
are the only two solutions in @xmath to the system @xmath .

One can go further than inclusion ( 1.11 ) and prove the following

###### Proposition 1.10.

Let @xmath seen as a matrix acting on @xmath and let see @xmath as a
matrix acting on @xmath . In this case we have @xmath , in particular

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the index zero denotes the identity component.

###### Proof.

We will prove that for each unital vector @xmath , the element @xmath is
a general element of norm @xmath in @xmath when @xmath runs over @xmath
. Explicit matrix computation will show by the way the equality @xmath .
The general product to be computed is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

But we know that the result is a matrix of @xmath , so it is sufficient
to compute the first line. If we denote by @xmath the columns of @xmath
, we find

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the dot denotes the inner product of @xmath . Since @xmath is a
general orthonormal basis of @xmath , the latter expression is a general
vector of norm @xmath in @xmath . ∎

### 1.3 Open and closed orbits

#### 1.3.1 Openness of orbits in homogeneous spaces

###### Proposition 1.11.

The orbits of @xmath are submanifolds of @xmath .

###### Proof.

Indeed proposition 4.4 in [ 18 ] (page 125) makes @xmath the orbit of
@xmath by @xmath and assure us that it is a submanifold of @xmath . That
proves the proposition for the orbit of @xmath .

For the other orbits, we consider the group @xmath which is also a Lie
subgroup of @xmath . The space @xmath is isomorphic to the orbit of
@xmath under the action of @xmath . Therefore @xmath is a submanifold of
@xmath and the very definition of a Lie group makes that @xmath is a
submanifold too.

∎

Let us start by computing the closed orbits of the actions of @xmath and
@xmath on @xmath . In order to see if @xmath belongs to a closed orbit
of @xmath , we “compare” the space spanned by the basis @xmath of @xmath
and the space spanned by the fundamental vectors of the action. If these
two spaces are equal, then @xmath belongs to an open orbit (because a
submanifold is open if and only if it has same dimension as the main
manifold). That idea is precisely contained in the following theorem
which holds for any homogeneous space @xmath .

###### Theorem 1.12.

If @xmath is a subgroup of @xmath with Lie algebra @xmath , then the
orbit @xmath is open in @xmath if and only if the projection @xmath
parallel to @xmath is surjective.

The projection is defined by @xmath if @xmath is the decomposition of
@xmath with respect to the decomposition @xmath . We need two lemmas
before to prove the theorem.

###### Lemma 1.13.

The orbit @xmath is open if and only if

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the fundamental field defined by equation ( B.13 ).

###### Proof.

From general theory of fundamental fields we know that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The game is now to prove that one can replace @xmath by @xmath if and
only if @xmath is open.

Necessary condition. If @xmath is open, we have a neighbourhood of
@xmath which is contained in @xmath . Then for any @xmath , and for a
small enough @xmath , the element @xmath belongs to @xmath . Hence we
have a path @xmath in @xmath such that @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since @xmath is a path in @xmath , we can replace it by a @xmath with a
@xmath in the derivative. For this @xmath , we have @xmath .

Sufficient condition. We have @xmath , so @xmath has the same dimension
as @xmath . The conclusion follows from the fact that a submanifold is
open if and only if it has maximal dimension.

∎

###### Lemma 1.14.

The canonical projection is surjective from @xmath to the tangent space
to identity:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Proof.

Consider the following computation when @xmath is given by the path
@xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath . Reading these lines from left to right shows that @xmath
while reading it from right to left shows the inverse inclusion. ∎

###### Proof of theorem 1.12.

From lemma 1.13 and lemma 1.14 , the orbit @xmath is open if and only if
@xmath is surjective. On the one hand any @xmath can uniquely be written
as @xmath with @xmath and @xmath . On the other hand it is clear that
@xmath , thus @xmath is open if and only if @xmath is surjective.

Now, recall that @xmath is surjective from @xmath , hence it is
surjective from @xmath . The first conclusion is that if @xmath is
surjective, then @xmath is open. The inverse implication remains to be
proved.

We know that openness @xmath implies that @xmath is bijective
(surjective because @xmath is open and injective because @xmath is
injective by proposition B.11 ). From all that, one concludes that
@xmath . Indeed, suppose that @xmath and @xmath . Since @xmath is
surjective, there exists a @xmath such that @xmath . This is impossible
because @xmath is injective from the whole @xmath .

∎

#### 1.3.2 Open orbits in anti de Sitter spaces

Now the strategy is to to check openness of the @xmath -orbit of @xmath
by checking openness of the @xmath -orbit of @xmath using the theorem
1.12 .

The problem is simplified by the following remark. We know that matrices
of @xmath and @xmath are given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

so we obviously have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This is nothing else than the fact that the @xmath -orbits are @xmath
-invariant. So the @xmath part of @xmath alone fixes the orbit which
contains @xmath and we have at most one orbit for each element in @xmath
. Computations using theorem 1.12 show that the @xmath -orbits of @xmath
with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is not open if and only if @xmath . We will see later that they are
actually closed (page 1.3.4 ), so that the singularity is described as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

Because of @xmath -invariance of the @xmath -orbits, the equation of the
@xmath -closed orbits can be expressed as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

Notice that there are some differences between the two choices of
Iwasawa decompositions of subsections B.49 and B.61 in the determination
of open and closed orbits. In the “new” Iwasawa decomposition (the one
which is always used if not mentioned), up to matrices of @xmath , a
general matrix of @xmath is @xmath . If we note @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

and it is obvious that the matrix @xmath can’t be obtained by
combinations of such matrices. So the @xmath -orbit of @xmath is not
open.

If we use the “old” Iwasawa decomposition, the result is completely
different. We have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.19)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

and other elements of @xmath are projections of the matrices @xmath ’s.
So we see that the map @xmath is surjective and the orbit @xmath is
open.

#### 1.3.3 Two other characterizations of the singularity

In this short section, we first give a coordinatewise characterization
of the singularity (which allows some brute force computations), and
then we point out that the vector field @xmath has vanishing norm on the
singularity (see also 1.19 ). That should make the connection with the
quotient construction of the original BTZ black hole. Notice that we do
not classify all vectors from which vanishing of the norm define a
singularity. The point is that one can make our black hole “causally
inextensible” by making a discrete quotient of @xmath along the integral
curves of @xmath .

###### Proposition 1.15.

In term of the embedding of @xmath in @xmath , the closed orbits of
@xmath are located at @xmath . Similarly, the closed orbits of @xmath
correspond to @xmath . In other words, the equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

describes the singularity @xmath .

###### Proof.

The different fundamental vector fields of the @xmath action can be
computed with the matricial relation @xmath . For example, in @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Full results are

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.21a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.21b)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.21c)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.21d)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.21e)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.21f)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath . First consider points satisfying @xmath . It is clear
that, at these points, the @xmath vectors @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath are linearly dependent. Thus, there are at most @xmath linearly
independent vectors amongst the @xmath vectors ( 1.21 ). We conclude
that a point satisfying @xmath belongs to a closed orbit of @xmath .

Now we show that a point with @xmath belongs to an open orbit of @xmath
. It is easy to see that @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are three linearly
independent vectors. The vectors @xmath gives us @xmath more. Then they
span a @xmath -dimensional space.

The same can be done with the closed orbits of @xmath . The result is
that a point belongs to a closed orbit of @xmath if and only if @xmath .
∎

This shows that in the three dimensional case, our black hole reduces to
the previously existing one.

The following corollary shows that a discrete quotient of @xmath along
the orbits of @xmath gives a direct higher-dimensional generalization of
the non-rotating BTZ black hole.

###### Corollary 1.16.

The singularity coincides with the set of points in @xmath where @xmath
for the metric induced from the ambient space @xmath .

###### Proof.

The expression ( 1.21a ) shows that the norm of @xmath is @xmath which
vanishes on the singularity. ∎

In the three-dimensional case, it was shown in [ 2 , 19 ] that the
non-rotating BTZ black hole singularity is precisely given by equation (
1.20 ). Hence, the following is a particular case of theorem 1.2 :

###### Corollary 1.17.

The non-rotating BTZ black hole is a causal symmetric solvable black
hole.

#### 1.3.4 Orbits and topology

Let @xmath where @xmath are the subgroups of @xmath with strictly
positive (negative). We see @xmath and @xmath as subgroups of @xmath in
the way indicated by equation ( 1.15 ). Notice that the parts @xmath and
@xmath are commuting and that @xmath . The notation @xmath refers to the
element of @xmath which the identity as @xmath -component and @xmath as
@xmath -component.

A continuous path from @xmath to @xmath must pass trough an element of
the form @xmath . We saw that the @xmath -orbit of such an element is
not open while the @xmath -orbit of an element of @xmath is open. So we
deduce that an orbit passing trough @xmath does not intersects @xmath .

The set @xmath is connected in @xmath and @xmath being open in @xmath ,
the set @xmath is also open in @xmath from the definition of the
topology (see [ 18 ] , chapter II, paragraph 4 and particularly the
theorem 4.2). Now, the orbits of @xmath in @xmath (who are all open)
furnish an open partition of @xmath . Such a partition is impossible for
an open connected set. We deduce that @xmath is only one orbit of @xmath
in @xmath . The same can be done with @xmath .

We are left with the sets @xmath and @xmath whose union is closed
because we just saw that the complement is open. Now we prove that these
two sets are disjoint, in such a way that they have to be separately
closed. Existence of an intersection point between @xmath and @xmath
would lead to the existence of a @xmath such that @xmath , or

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

that is a non trivial @xmath -component to @xmath in the decomposition
@xmath , but the only @xmath -component in @xmath is @xmath . Hence such
a @xmath does not exist and @xmath .

The conclusion is that the Iwasawa group @xmath has only four orbits :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.22)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The two first are open and the other two are closed. Remark that an
element of @xmath does not belongs to a closed orbit of @xmath or @xmath
.

### 1.4 Horizons

#### 1.4.1 Existence

We are now able to prove that definition 1.3 provides a non empty
horizon as expressed by the condition ( 1.2 ). First we consider points
of the form @xmath , which are parametrized by an angle @xmath . Up to
the choice of this parametrization, a light-like geodesic trough @xmath
is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath and @xmath . Using the isomorphism @xmath between @xmath and
@xmath , we find

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

According to proposition 1.15 , this geodesic reaches the singularity if
@xmath for a certain (positive) @xmath . Since @xmath is nilpotent, the
computation of @xmath is simple and we only need the first column
because it only acts on the first basis vector. A short computation
shows that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

We conclude that the geodesic reaches @xmath and @xmath for values
@xmath and @xmath of the affine parameter, given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.25)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the second component of the first column of @xmath , see
equation ( 1.4 ); in particular @xmath .

Since the part @xmath is precisely @xmath , we may restrict ourselves to
the open connected domain of @xmath given by @xmath . More precisely,
@xmath is the equation of @xmath in the @xmath decomposition. In the
same way, @xmath is given by @xmath in the @xmath decomposition. In
order to escape the singularity, the point @xmath needs both @xmath and
@xmath to be strictly positive. It is only possible to find directions
(i.e. a parameter @xmath ) which respects this condition when @xmath .
So the point

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

is one point of the horizon. Theorem 1.2 is now proved.

The following proposition contains some physical intuition about the
nature of the horizon.

###### Proposition 1.18.

A light-like geodesic which escapes the singularity (i.e. which does not
intersect @xmath ) and which passes trough a point of the horizon is
contained in the horizon.

###### Proof.

Let @xmath be a point of the horizon and @xmath , a light-like geodesic
escaping the singularity. Near from @xmath , there exists a point @xmath
in the black hole. From definition of a black hole, for all @xmath and
@xmath , points of the form @xmath also belong to the black hole. From
continuity, in each neighbourhood of @xmath , there is such a @xmath .
This proves that @xmath belongs to the closure of the black hole. But it
is not in the interior of the black hole because (by assumption) the
given geodesic escapes the singularity, so every point of the form
@xmath belongs to the horizon. ∎

Let us consider the point of the horizon that we know (the one given by
( 1.26 )), and see how can that point hope to escape the singularity.
Equations ( 1.25 ) which give the time needed to fall into the
singularity become

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.27)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

So for every @xmath , this point reaches the singularity within a finite
time. Taking the direction @xmath the point is able to reject his fall
to infinity. This agrees to physical intuition which is that the horizon
corresponds to points that fall into the singularity within an infinite
time.

#### 1.4.2 Characterization

Let @xmath be the set of light-like directions (vectors in @xmath ) for
which the point @xmath falls into @xmath . Similarly, the set @xmath is
the one of directions which fall into @xmath . One can express @xmath in
terms of @xmath :

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

So

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

where by definition, @xmath with @xmath being defined by @xmath ( @xmath
is the Cartan involution). It is easy to see that @xmath changes the
sign of the spacial part of @xmath , i.e. changes @xmath .

A main property of @xmath is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since @xmath only appears in the expression @xmath , that property is
actually a sufficient characterization of @xmath for our purpose. In
particular, @xmath , but @xmath .

How to express the condition @xmath in terms of @xmath ? The condition
to belong to the black hole is @xmath . If the complementary of @xmath
has an interior (i.e. if it contains an open subset), then by continuity
the complementary @xmath has also an interior for all @xmath near from
@xmath . In this case, @xmath cannot belong to the horizon. So a
characterization of @xmath is the fact that the boundary of @xmath and
@xmath coincide. Equation ( 1.28 ) expresses this condition under the
form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

from which one immediately deduces that @xmath is @xmath -invariant.

We have an expression of @xmath for @xmath by examining equations ( 1.25
). The set @xmath is the set of @xmath such that @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

So in order for @xmath to belong to @xmath , the point @xmath must
satisfy

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Consequently, if @xmath is the @xmath -component of @xmath in the @xmath
decomposition, we impose @xmath , and we can describe the horizon by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the @xmath -component of @xmath in the @xmath
decomposition.

### 1.5 Simple example on @xmath

As is appendix B.8.1 , we see @xmath as @xmath . From definition 1.3 ,
the singularity is the closed orbits of @xmath and @xmath for the
adjoint action on @xmath , and the notion of fundamental field is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

A basis of the Lie algebra @xmath is given by @xmath . So @xmath will
belong to a closed orbit if and only if @xmath . If we put @xmath , the
computation is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It is zero if and only if @xmath . The closed orbit of @xmath is given
by the same computation with @xmath . The part of these orbits contained
in @xmath is the one with norm @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In both cases, it imposes @xmath , and the closed orbits in @xmath are
given by

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.33a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.33b)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath . The singularity is then the union @xmath of four lines in
the hyperboloid.

###### Proposition 1.19.

The singularity can equivalently be described as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

which has to be compared with corollary 1.16 .

###### Proof.

The condition ( 1.34 ) on @xmath reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

The most general ⁴ ⁴ 4 It is actually more than the most general element
to be considered because our space is @xmath , which is only a part of
@xmath . element @xmath in @xmath is @xmath . We have @xmath , so that
the condition ( 1.35 ) becomes @xmath . The two possibilities are @xmath
and @xmath . The singularity in @xmath is composed of the planes @xmath
and @xmath . The intersection between the plane @xmath and the
hyperboloid is given by the equation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

whose solutions are @xmath . The same is also true for the plane @xmath
. So we find that the set ( 1.34 ) is exactly the four lines ( 1.33 ).

∎

One can check that light cone of a given point of the hyperboloid is
given by the two straight lines trough the point; so it automatically
intersects the singularity. As conclusion, every point of @xmath belong
to the black hole. For this reason we say that there is no black hole in
the two dimensional case because the inclusions ( 1.2 ) are in fact
equalities. .

### 1.6 Conclusions and perspectives

Higher-dimensional generalizations of the BTZ construction have been
studied in the physics’ literature, by classifying the one-parameter
subgroups of @xmath , see [ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ] . Nevertheless,
the approach we adopt here is conceptually different. We first
reinterpret the non-rotating BTZ black hole solution using symmetric
spaces techniques and present an alternative way to express its
singularity. We saw the latter as the union of the closed orbits of
Iwasawa subgroups of the isometry group. As shown, this construction
extends straightforwardly to higher dimensional cases, allowing to build
a non trivial black hole on anti de Sitter spaces of arbitrary dimension
@xmath . From this point of view, all anti de Sitter spaces of dimension
@xmath appear on an equal footing.

A natural question arising from this analysis is the following: given a
semisimple symmetric space, when does the set of closed orbits of the
Iwasawa subgroups of the isometry group, seen as singularity, define a
non-trivial causal structure ? We answered this question in the case of
anti de Sitter spaces, using techniques allowing in principle for
generalization to any semisimple symmetric space.

We also proved that performing a discrete quotient along the orbits of
@xmath makes the resulting space causally inextensible (closed
space-like curves appear in the singular part of the space), but we did
not address questions like: are there other vector fields defining
singularities (in the three dimensional case, we know that the answer is
positive) ? Can we identify a mass and an angular momentum from these
hypothetic vectors ? Are all BTZ black holes obtainable in this way in
higher dimensions ?

## Chapter 2 Deformation of anti de Sitter spaces

### 2.1 Group structure on the open orbits

#### 2.1.1 Global structure

The following definition formalises the idea for a manifold to be “like
a group”. We will prove that the physical domain of our anti de Sitter
black hole is of this type.

###### Definition 2.1.

A @xmath -dimensional homogeneous space @xmath is locally of
(symplectic) group type if there exists a Lie (symplectic) subgroup
@xmath of the group of automorphisms of @xmath which acts freely on one
of its orbits in @xmath . The homogeneous space is globally of group
type if @xmath has only one orbit. In this case, for every choice of a
base point @xmath in @xmath , the map @xmath is a diffeomorphism.

Lie groups are themselves examples of symmetric spaces (globally) of
group type. In the symplectic situation, however, a symplectic symmetric
Lie group must be abelian ( [ 20 ] , page 12). We will see in what
follows other non-abelian examples.

In the context of our anti de Sitter black hole (in particular when one
has causal issues in mind), it is not important to deform the whole
space but it is sufficient ² ² 2 We will however point out in the
perspectives (section 1.6 ) that a quantization of the whole space has a
real interest. to only deform one open orbit of @xmath . Indeed, if an
observer begins his life somewhere in the physical space (hence in an
open orbit of @xmath ), he will never exit the orbit because one open
orbit of @xmath is bounded by closed orbit of @xmath which are singular.

Let us recall that the solvable part of the Iwasawa decomposition of
@xmath may be realized with a nilpotent part @xmath and an abelian one
@xmath with elements

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
                                            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.1a)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

and the commutator table

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
                                            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.2a)
              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.2b)
              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.2c)
              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.2d)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where we know that that @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath . We pick the point

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This is an element of @xmath which, as already mentioned in page 1.3.4 ,
therefore does not belong to a closed orbit of @xmath , neither to a one
of @xmath . Hence @xmath lies in the physical part of @xmath . We denote
by @xmath the @xmath -orbit of @xmath .

Elements of the stabilizer of @xmath in @xmath are elements @xmath such
that @xmath , i.e. elements for which there exists @xmath in @xmath such
that @xmath . It is easy to check that @xmath and @xmath are solutions
by noticing that the action of @xmath leaves unchanged the first basis
vector ³ ³ 3 We give in a complement a more intrinsic way to prove that
result, see page 2.1.2 . .

The stabilizer cannot contain more than two generators because an open
orbit must be four dimensional. The stabilizer of @xmath in @xmath is
thus the group generated by @xmath and @xmath plus eventually a discrete
set making @xmath non connected. The group @xmath is in fact connected
because

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

Since @xmath is an exponential group, we have @xmath where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The set @xmath being connected (because it is the image by a continuous
map of the connected set @xmath ), @xmath is connected too.

The open orbit that we are studying is thus realised as the homogeneous
space @xmath . An important result is the fact that what we obtain by
simply removing @xmath and @xmath from the table ( 2.2 ) is still an
algebra. The orbit @xmath is therefore isomorphic to the group @xmath
generated by the Lie algebra @xmath . The table of @xmath is

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.4a)
              @xmath      (2.4b)
              @xmath      (2.4c)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

From construction, @xmath . Unfortunately, using the conditions ( B.83
), we find that in order to be compatible with the Lie algebra
structure, the form @xmath of the algebra must satisfy @xmath , so that
it is degenerate. The action of @xmath on @xmath enjoys however some
remarkable properties.

###### Proposition 2.2.

The action

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath            (2.5)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------

is free and simply transitive.

###### Proof.

First, we prove that the action of @xmath is transitive. As an algebra,
@xmath is a split extension @xmath . Hence, as group, @xmath , or
equivalently @xmath . That proves that the action is transitive.

If the action is not simply transitive, there exists @xmath and @xmath ,
@xmath such that @xmath . Since the action of @xmath is transitive, we
have a @xmath such that @xmath . In this case, the element @xmath of
@xmath fixes @xmath , but @xmath . Then one deduces that @xmath , so
that @xmath . It follows that @xmath fixes @xmath , and thus that @xmath
, so that @xmath .

For freeness remark that, in a neighbourhood of @xmath , the neutral
@xmath itself is the only element trivially acting on @xmath .

∎

As corollary, the orbit @xmath is locally of group type @xmath .

###### Proposition 2.3.

The orbit @xmath is simply connected.

###### Proof.

The fibration @xmath induces the long exact sequence of cohomology
groups

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The group @xmath being connected and simply connected, the sequence
shows that @xmath , but we already mentioned that @xmath is connected,
so @xmath .

∎

###### Corollary 2.4.

The open orbit @xmath is globally of group type.

###### Proof.

It is immediately apparent from proof of proposition 2.2 . Since

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

the group @xmath acts freely on @xmath and has only one orbit. ∎

Remark that it remains to be proved that @xmath is globally of
symplectic group type. For that, there should be a symplectic form on
@xmath . Exploiting the fact that @xmath is a three-dimensional abelian
subalgebra of @xmath , it is easy to see that @xmath does not accepts a
symplectic form. Hence corollary 2.4 does not proves that @xmath is
globally of symplectic group type. The lack of symplectic form on the
algebra reflects on @xmath as manifold by the following lemma, and
motivates the search for other four-dimensional groups than @xmath
acting transitively on @xmath .

###### Lemma 2.5.

The open orbit @xmath does not admit any @xmath -invariant symplectic
form.

###### Proof.

Let @xmath be such an invariant symplectic form and @xmath be the
pull-back of @xmath by the action: @xmath . We have @xmath because
@xmath , thus

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

so that @xmath is a @xmath -invariant symplectic form on @xmath . But we
saw that such a form does not exist. ∎

###### Proposition 2.6.

The @xmath -homogeneous space @xmath admits a unique structure of
globally group type symplectic symmetric space. The latter is isomorphic
to @xmath described in appendix A.5.5 .

The next few pages are dedicated to prove this proposition and to give
explicit algebra whose group gives the answer. We are searching for
@xmath -dimensional groups @xmath which

-   has a free and simply transitive action on @xmath , i.e. @xmath ,

-   admits a symplectic structure,

and we want it to be unique. As already mentioned, the algebra @xmath
fails to fulfil the symplectic condition. The algebra @xmath of a group
which fulfils the first condition must at least act transitively on a
small neighbourhood of @xmath and thus be of the form

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.6a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.6b)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.6c)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.6d)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Indeed, in a first attempt, we choose an algebra for which each of
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath contains a combination of @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath . We consider the matrix of coefficients of
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath in @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath . If the determinant of this matrix is zero, then one of the
lines can be written as combination of the three others. In this case
the action can even not be locally transitive because the algebra only
spans three directions actually acting ( @xmath and @xmath have no
importance here). So the determinant is non vanishing. In this case, the
inverse of this matrix is a change of basis which puts @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath under the form ( 2.6 ).

The problem is now to fix the parameters @xmath in such a way that the
space @xmath becomes a Lie algebra (i.e. it closes under the Lie
bracket) which admits a symplectic structure and whose group acts
transitively on @xmath . We will begin by proving that the surjectivity
condition imposes @xmath . Then the remaining conditions for @xmath to
be an algebra are easy to solve by hand.

First, remark that @xmath acts on the algebra @xmath because @xmath does
not appears in @xmath . Hence we can write @xmath and, a subalgebra of a
solvable exponential Lie algebra being a solvable exponential algebra, a
general element of the group @xmath reads @xmath . Our strategy will be
to split this expression in order to get a product @xmath (which is
equivalent to a product @xmath ). As Lie algebra, @xmath . Hence there
exist functions @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath of @xmath
such that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

We are now going to determine @xmath and study the conditions needed in
order for @xmath to be surjective on @xmath . Since @xmath does not
appear in any commutator, the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula yields
@xmath . From the fact that @xmath , we see that the coefficient of
@xmath in the left hand side of ( 2.7 ) is @xmath . The @xmath
-component in the exponential can also get out without changing the
coefficient of @xmath . We are left with @xmath where @xmath and @xmath
are complicated functions of @xmath and @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is only surjective when @xmath . Taking the inverse, a general
element of @xmath reads @xmath , where the range of @xmath is not the
whole @xmath . Since the action of @xmath is simply transitive, @xmath
is not surjective on @xmath when @xmath is not surjective on @xmath .

When @xmath , the conditions for ( 2.6 ) to be an algebra are easy to
solve, leaving only two a priori possible two-parameter families of
algebras.

1.  The first one is the following:

      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --
                                                
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --

    with @xmath . The general symplectic form on that algebra is given
    by

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (2.10)
      -- -------- -- --------

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    Conditions: @xmath , @xmath . That algebra will be denoted by @xmath
    . The analytic subgroup of @xmath whose Lie algebra is @xmath is
    denoted by @xmath . One can eliminate the two parameters in algebra
    @xmath by the isomorphism

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (2.11)
      -- -------- -- --------

    which fixes @xmath and @xmath . The algebra @xmath is thus
    isomorphic to

      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.12)
                  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

    Comparing with equation ( A.92 ), one recognizes the one-dimensional
    extension of Heisenberg algebra with parameters @xmath , @xmath and
    @xmath . Hence @xmath is isomorphic to @xmath and, by the way, we
    have a product on that group (see appendix A.5 ).

2.  The second algebra whose group acts simply transitively on @xmath
    is:

      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
         @xmath   @xmath                     
      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --

    There is no way to get a nondegenerate symplectic form on that
    algebra.

From proposition A.22 , the symplectic structure to be chosen on @xmath
is @xmath and lemma A.29 shows that we are able to quantize ⁴ ⁴ 4 by
opposition to deform : there are no symplectic condition in deformation.
@xmath with any symplectic form in the coadjoint orbit @xmath with
@xmath . The coadjoint adjoint action of @xmath on @xmath can be
computed using the fact that @xmath splits into four parts; the non
trivial results are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath                     
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --

Direct computations show that

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.13)
  -- -- -- --------

so that, with more compact notations,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the symplectic forms that we are able to deform are given by @xmath
. It provides a two-parameter familly of symplectic forms

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It turns out that the action of the group @xmath has good properties
that are given in the following proposition.

###### Proposition 2.7.

The action of @xmath on @xmath is free and simply transitive.

###### Proof.

First remark that the algebra @xmath can be written as a split
extension:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

hence a general element of @xmath reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

The work is now to expand it by replacing @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath by their values in function of @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath
, @xmath and @xmath , and then to try to put all elements of @xmath on
the left. This is done by virtue of Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula.
The fact that @xmath is nilpotent dramatically reduces the difficulty.
We have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

One can find @xmath and @xmath (functions of @xmath ) such that the
right hand side reduces to @xmath . Hence we have, for some auxiliary
functions @xmath and @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and a general element of @xmath reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath and @xmath which defines a bijective map @xmath from @xmath
to @xmath . This proves the transitivity of the action of @xmath .

For freeness, just remark that in a neighbourhood of @xmath , no element
of @xmath (but @xmath ) leaves @xmath unchanged. ∎

The conclusion is that @xmath is the group @xmath that we were searching
for and that it is unique (up to the two-parameter isomorphism ( 2.11 ))
as symplectic subgroup of @xmath acting transitively on @xmath . It
concludes the proof of proposition 2.6 .

#### 2.1.2 Alternative more intrinsic proofs

###### Proposition 2.8.

Let @xmath whose associated conjugation coincides with the Cartan
involution: @xmath and @xmath such that @xmath and @xmath . Then the
@xmath -orbit of @xmath is open.

###### Proof.

Let us find the Lie algebra @xmath of the stabilizer @xmath of @xmath .
First, the Cartan involution @xmath is implemented as @xmath with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which satisfies @xmath and @xmath because @xmath . Now, @xmath if and
only if @xmath . Using the fact that @xmath is an involutive
automorphism, we see that this condition is equivalent to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

On the one hand the Cartan involution @xmath restricts on @xmath to
@xmath because @xmath ; and on the other hand, @xmath because @xmath and
@xmath . So @xmath splits @xmath into two parts: @xmath with @xmath and
@xmath . Let @xmath be the dual basis: @xmath . We know that @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath , and @xmath . The set of simple roots is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the positive roots are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

in terms of whose, the space @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --

Since @xmath , we find we find

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

We are now able to identify the set @xmath . Let us take @xmath and
apply @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath denote elements of @xmath , and @xmath
denote the component @xmath of @xmath .

It is immediately apparent that @xmath , so that @xmath . The only other
component common to @xmath and @xmath is in @xmath , but it is a priori
not clear that @xmath . We know however that @xmath because @xmath has
only one dimension. Using the fact that @xmath and @xmath are commuting
involutions, it is apparent that @xmath . Decomposing @xmath into @xmath
, we have @xmath which has to be equal to @xmath or @xmath . Thus there
are only two possibilities

  -- -------- -------- -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath      @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath      @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -- -------- -------- --

If one compares the commutator table of @xmath with the one of @xmath ,
one sees that @xmath is not present in @xmath . Since @xmath possesses
every purely spatial rotation generators, the orthogonal complement
@xmath contains the time-time rotation as only rotations. Other
components of @xmath are boost. In particular, @xmath is zero or a boost
generator. In the latter case, @xmath , and the conclusion is that
@xmath . In the other case, @xmath implies that @xmath which is
impossible because @xmath while @xmath and @xmath .

The stabilizer @xmath is thus generated by @xmath and @xmath , i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

The stabilizer of @xmath being two-dimensional, the orbit of @xmath is
four-dimensional and is then open in @xmath .

∎

Notice that in contrast to the first way to find @xmath , this time we
have no eventually double covering problems.

Let @xmath be a subgroup of @xmath whose Lie algebra is a complement of
@xmath in @xmath , i.e. @xmath . This group does not act transitively on
@xmath if and only if the boundary of @xmath is non empty. Let @xmath
belong to that boundary with @xmath . On that point, the fundamental
fields of @xmath are not surjective on the tangent space of @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Let @xmath belongs to this kernel: @xmath . Since the linear map @xmath
is nondegenerate, @xmath vanishes if and only if @xmath , but

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

because, on the point @xmath , the action to take the fundamental field
is nothing else than the projection parallel to @xmath . Hence the group
@xmath is not surjective if and only if

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We are now going to determine @xmath . Let @xmath and act with an
element of @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

The computation of @xmath is as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --

so @xmath . Since @xmath , the computation of @xmath , produces terms
like @xmath . Therefore, @xmath and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

What we have proven is the following result.

###### Proposition 2.9.

The group @xmath acts transitively on @xmath if and only if the Lie
algebra @xmath does not contains elements of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with @xmath and @xmath ; the element @xmath being given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the decomposition of an element of @xmath and @xmath are
elements of their respective root spaces @xmath .

One can distinguish three case: the first is @xmath , the second is
@xmath and the last one is @xmath ( @xmath ).

In the first case, formula ( 2.22 ) forbids @xmath to contains elements
of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

The second case forbids elements of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the third case forbids

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

We can extract constraints on the coefficients of algebra ( 2.6 ) from
that analysis. The third interdiction makes that a linear combination of
@xmath and @xmath in an element of @xmath can only occur in @xmath , so
that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The second interdiction says that @xmath and @xmath cannot contain
@xmath alone, so @xmath . Finally, the first condition imposes @xmath
because @xmath and @xmath cannot contain @xmath alone. The remaining
constraints for ( 2.6 ) to be an algebra are easy to solve by hand. The
results are the same two algebras as previously found.

#### 2.1.3 Local group structure

We saw in proposition 2.7 that the open orbit @xmath can be identified
with the group generated by the algebra @xmath .

We want to find an algebra (whose group is) acting transitively on a
neighbourhood of @xmath in the @xmath orbit of @xmath and which admits a
symplectic form. Let @xmath be a basis of this algebra. For local
transitivity, each of them must contains at least one of @xmath and
@xmath . As in the previous case, the most general algebra to be studied
is

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.26a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.26b)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.26c)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.26d)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Among such algebras, we will have to check surjectivity of the action
and the possibility to endow with a symplectic form.

If we impose that @xmath is a subalgebra for the bracket inherited from
@xmath , we find a lot of conditions on the coefficients @xmath , @xmath
, @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . If, for
example, we look at @xmath , we find

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In this combination, the coefficient of @xmath is @xmath and the one of
@xmath is @xmath , so the only possibility is @xmath . This leads to the
following conditions (equating coefficients of @xmath and @xmath ):

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -- ---------
                                                                                                 
                                                                            @xmath   @xmath      (2.27a)
                                                                            @xmath   @xmath      (2.27b)
  Proceeding in a similar way for the six different commutators, we find:                        
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -- ---------

For @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.27c)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.27d)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

for @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.27e)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.27f)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

for @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.27g)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.27h)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

for @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.27i)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.27j)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

for @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.27k)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.27l)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Solutions of these equations ⁵ ⁵ 5 from now until the determination of
symplectic forms, all results are computed by Maxima [ 21 ] . ,
parametrized by reals @xmath and @xmath and the corresponding
commutators are listed below.

The next step is to determine which of these algebras admit a compatible
symplectic structure. For this, we just have to consider a general
skew-symmetric matrix

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and, for each algebra, solve the four constrains. In the first algebra
(see below), we find for example

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

so that @xmath . Full results are listed below (the symplectic matrices
are written in the basis @xmath ). We see in particular that most of the
solutions reduce to the canonical algebra , @xmath given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --

1.  As first solution, we find of course the same algebra @xmath as the
    one of page 1. .

2.  The second solution is also the same as the previously found one.

3.  The third solution is

      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (2.28)

      -- -------- --

    Conditions: @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . The map @xmath

         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    algebra.

4.  The fourth solution is

    Conditions: @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . The map @xmath

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    algebra.

5.  The fifth solution is

         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath

6.  The sixth solution is

         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath

All these algebras are solvable of order two (the commutators of
commutators vanish) — but not nilpotent.

### 2.2 Isospectral deformations of @xmath

In this section, we present a modified version of the oscillatory
integral product ( A.101 ) leading to a left-invariant associative
algebra structure on the space of square integrable functions on @xmath
. Why is it better that the initial product defined over smooth
compactly supported functions ? The motivation of considering the square
integrable functions is the fact that the spectral triple defined in non
commutative geometry contains the space of square integrable spinors
(see the book [ 22 ] ). The fact to stabilize the space of square
integrable functions is then an indispensable step in order to put our
results in the framework of spectral geometry.

###### Theorem 2.10.

Let @xmath and @xmath be smooth compactly supported functions on @xmath
. Define the following three-point functions:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then the formula

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

extends to @xmath as a left-invariant associative Hilbert algebra
structure. In particular, one has the strong closedness property:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

The oscillatory integral product ( A.101 ) may be obtained by
intertwining the Weyl product on the Schwartz space @xmath (in the
Darboux global coordinates ( A.100 )) by the following integral operator
[ 23 ] :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

@xmath being the partial Fourier transform with respect to the central
variable @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and @xmath the one parameter family of diffeomorphism(s):

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Set @xmath and observe that for all @xmath , the function @xmath belongs
to @xmath . Indeed, one has

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Therefore, a standard density argument yields the following isometry:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath denotes the multiplication by @xmath . Observing that
@xmath , one has @xmath . A straightforward computation (similar to the
one in [ 14 ] ) then yields the announced formula. ∎

Let us point out two facts with respect to the above formulas:

1.  The oscillating three-point kernel @xmath is symmetric under cyclic
    permutations.

2.  The above oscillating integral formula gives rise to a strongly
    closed, symmetry invariant, formal star product on the symplectic
    symmetric space @xmath .

###### Proposition 2.11.

The space @xmath of smooth vectors in @xmath of the left regular
representation closes as a subalgebra of @xmath .

###### Proof.

First, observe that the space of smooth vectors may be described as the
intersection of the spaces @xmath where @xmath , with @xmath and @xmath
is defined as the space of elements @xmath of @xmath such that, for all
@xmath , @xmath exists as an element of @xmath (we endow it with the
projective limit topology).

Let thus @xmath . Then, @xmath belongs to @xmath . Observing that @xmath
and approximating @xmath and @xmath by sequences @xmath and @xmath in
@xmath , one gets (by continuity of @xmath ): @xmath . Hence @xmath
belongs to @xmath . One then proceeds by induction. ∎

### 2.3 Spin structure and Dirac operator

Construction of the frame bundle is a straightforward adaptation of
theorem 2.2 (chapter II) in [ 24 ] , while connection issues are adapted
from proposition 1.3 (chapter III). According proposition B.3 ,
notations @xmath and @xmath stand for the identity components of @xmath
and @xmath .

#### 2.3.1 Frame bundle and spin structure

An element of the frame bundle is a map from @xmath to @xmath of the
form ⁶ ⁶ 6 See B.3.2 for notations. @xmath where @xmath and @xmath . By
proposition 1.10 , there exists a @xmath for which @xmath for every
@xmath so we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

hence in fact every element in the frame bundle reads @xmath for some
@xmath . We conclude that the fibre @xmath over @xmath is made of maps
of the form @xmath with @xmath . The action of @xmath on the frame
bundle is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proposition 2.12.

The map

  -- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath            (2.39)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --------

is a principal bundle isomorphism between the frame bundle and the
principal bundle

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.40)
  -- -- -- --------

where @xmath is the natural projection, the action of @xmath is the
right one and the wavy line means “acts on”.

###### Proof.

Surjectivity of @xmath is clear. For injectivity, suppose @xmath . In
order for the two target spaces to be equal, one needs @xmath for a
@xmath . Now we have, for all @xmath ,

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.41)
  -- -- -- --------

but @xmath is an isomorphism from @xmath , so we deduce that @xmath .
Since we are using the connected component of @xmath , that implies that
@xmath , and thus that @xmath . The following proves that @xmath is a
morphism:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

∎

The following lemma provides a convenient way to express the tangent
bundle over @xmath as an associated bundle to the principal bundle (
2.40 ). We denote by @xmath the quotient of @xmath by the equivalence
relation @xmath for all @xmath .

###### Lemma 2.13.

The map

  -- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath            (2.42)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --------

with @xmath is diffeomorphic.

###### Proof.

In order to check that @xmath is well defined, first compute

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and then using the fact that @xmath , the latter line reduces to @xmath
. For injectivity, let @xmath . In order for these two to be vectors on
the same point, there must exists a @xmath such that @xmath . The
equality becomes @xmath . Commuting @xmath with @xmath and using the
fact that @xmath is an isomorphism, we are left with the condition
@xmath .

An element of @xmath is an equivalence class which contains exactly one
element of @xmath . In the right hand side of the condition, this
element is @xmath while the element of @xmath in the class @xmath is
@xmath . Equating these two elements, we find the condition @xmath ,
which proves that @xmath and concludes the proof of the injectivity of
@xmath . ∎

The following proposition will prove useful in order to identity the
spin structure over @xmath .

###### Proposition 2.14.

If @xmath is a connected Lie group and if @xmath is the center of @xmath
, then

1.  @xmath is an analytic homomorphism from @xmath to @xmath , with
    kernel @xmath ,

2.   the map @xmath is an analytic isomorphism from @xmath to @xmath
    (the class @xmath is taken with respect to @xmath ).

On the one hand that proposition among with the fact that @xmath proves
that the quotient @xmath is isomorphic to @xmath . On the other hand one
knows that @xmath has no center, so that @xmath . But the subsection
B.11.2 provides an isomorphism between @xmath and @xmath . Thus we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

We denote by @xmath the corresponding homomorphism with kernel @xmath .
In particular the restriction @xmath is a double covering of @xmath .
But @xmath is the same kind of double covering, so universality of
@xmath on @xmath provides an automorphism @xmath such that @xmath . The
spin structure to be considered on @xmath is

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

where the action of @xmath on @xmath is given by @xmath where we
identified @xmath with @xmath as subgroup of @xmath . One immediately
has @xmath .

#### 2.3.2 Connection

There are a lot of ways to express a vector field @xmath . From the
identification @xmath , one has @xmath . As section of an associated
bundle, @xmath can be expressed by an equivariant function @xmath such
that @xmath . The @xmath -equivariance of @xmath means that @xmath . Let
@xmath and consider the function

  -- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath            (2.44)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --------

which is equivariant because the decomposition @xmath is reductive. The
corresponding vector field is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

or

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

because @xmath . It is easy to check that the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is a connection form on the principal bundle ( 2.40 ). We are going to
determine the associated covariant derivative of this connection on the
tangent space, and prove that it is torsion free. The horizontal lift of
@xmath is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

The equivariant function associated with the covariant derivative of
@xmath in the direction of @xmath is given by @xmath . Using expressions
( 2.44 ) and ( 2.45 ) of @xmath and @xmath , we have

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

This commutator is an expression of the form @xmath . Using reducibility
we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

The commutator produces

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which by construction the equivariant function associated with the
vector field @xmath ; so on the one hand we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

On the other hand,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which proves that the connection is torsion free.

We are now going to study the horizontal vector fields on @xmath with
this connection and the homomorphism @xmath of equation ( B.80 ). We
have to study for which elements @xmath the expression

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

vanishes. Every such element can of course be written under the form
@xmath for some @xmath . So we are lead to consider the expression

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is easy to deal with that expression in the case of @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In particular, if @xmath , then @xmath and when @xmath , we have @xmath
. This result propagates to other elements @xmath using the general
result

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which holds for any group homomorphism @xmath . Using that property with
@xmath on the point @xmath , we find @xmath , and the expression ( 2.47
) becomes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It is zero if and only if @xmath , so that the horizontal vectors on
@xmath are exactly the ones of @xmath .

#### 2.3.3 Dirac operator

When @xmath is the equivariant function associated with a spinor, the
Dirac operator reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the metric @xmath is the usual four-dimensional Minkowskian metric
and the matrices @xmath are the associated @xmath Dirac matrices. The
elements @xmath span the natural basis of @xmath , see appendix B.11.3 .
The matrices @xmath are the usual @xmath Dirac matrices for the @xmath
-dimensional Minkowskian metric.

One can find a change of basis which express the Dirac operator in terms
of vectors of @xmath . For that, let @xmath be a basis of @xmath . We
have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

that is necessarily decomposable by corollary B.12 as combinations of
vectors of the form @xmath because @xmath belongs to an open orbit of
the action of @xmath . That defines a matrix @xmath by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and then a vector @xmath by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now we have @xmath . We can go further using the fact that @xmath for
every @xmath and @xmath . Defining the vectors @xmath we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

### 2.4 Perspectives

A main achievement of spectral non-commutative geometry is the ability
of retrieving the original Riemannian manifold from the data of the
spectral triple. Such a result does not exist in the case of @xmath
because the latter is a non-compact pseudo -Riemannian manifold. The
main lines of such a reconstruction method can however be foreseen in
the case of anti de Sitter space.

-   Knowing the family of products @xmath , we know in particular the
    usual commutative product of functions. That should allow us to find
    back the manifold @xmath .

-   It is possible to extract the data of the curvature of the manifold
    from the data of its Dirac operator as the non-differential part of
    its square. That part will of course appear to be constant and
    negative (because we know that we were starting from anti de
    Sitter).

We only quantized an open orbit of @xmath because it is a whole physical
domain. Quantization of the full space could be very interesting because
of a special effect of the noncommutative product: two functions with
disjoint supports can have a non vanishing product. What about the
physical significance of that property when one multiplies a function
supported in the singularity by a function supported in the physical
part ?

There is another reason to study the quantization of the full space. We
will show in section 3.2 that a deformation of the full space by action
of the Iwasawa component of @xmath is possible. That quantization has
the advantage of deforming the space by the action of the group which is
precisely defining the singularity. In other words the same group can
describe a singularity and a quantization. A work to be done is to try
and recover the special causal structure from the data of the quantized
manifold. That structure must be in some way contained in the spectral
triple.

## Chapter 3 Two notes for further developments

### 3.1 Formula of Unterberger on @xmath

The following results come from [ 25 ] (from page 1219) and provide a
deformation ¹ ¹ 1 or, at least, a new noncommutative product. of the
half-plane

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Before to give the precise statement that will be used, we need some
definitions. A first product is defined by (we will precise the
functional space later):

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the same for @xmath . In particular,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Definition 3.1.

Let @xmath , @xmath and @xmath be real numbers with @xmath . We denote
by @xmath the space of functions @xmath such that for all @xmath , there
exists a @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now, theorem 8.2 in [ 25 ] states

###### Theorem 3.2.

Let @xmath and @xmath . For each @xmath , the function

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

belongs to the space @xmath if constants @xmath are defined by the
requirement that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for every smooth function @xmath and @xmath when @xmath and @xmath and
@xmath otherwise. The operators @xmath are defined by @xmath and @xmath
.

For our purpose, the point is that there exists a product on @xmath and
that theorem 3.2 provides a functional space stabilized by the product.
We are now going to translate this result in terms of the Iwasawa
subgroup @xmath of @xmath that is parametrized (see ( B.22 )) by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The map

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath            (3.4)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------

provides an isomorphism between @xmath and the group

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The inverse of @xmath is @xmath . The group @xmath acts on @xmath by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is a freely transitive action. For each choice of “reference
point” @xmath we build an identification @xmath by the requirement
@xmath , that is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now we can identify @xmath to @xmath by @xmath , @xmath . For the choice
@xmath , we find @xmath where

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.7)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

and the function @xmath on @xmath corresponds to the function @xmath on
@xmath .

The result of Unterberger is that the function @xmath “can be quantized”
if

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are real numbers and @xmath . We want
to see what condition has to be imposed on @xmath in order for @xmath to
fulfil this condition. In other words, we want to express the operator

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

in terms of the coordinates on @xmath . For that we compute @xmath and
@xmath in terms of @xmath and @xmath .

Let us precise that, when we write expressions like @xmath , we mean for
example

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For @xmath we have:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

using the formula ( 3.7 ), we find @xmath and we conclude that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

For @xmath , we find

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and we conclude that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

So the operator @xmath , expressed on @xmath , reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

and condition ( 3.8 ), with @xmath reads now

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath and @xmath , being any real number. From now on this
regularity condition will be referred as the Unterberger’s condition .
That condition characterises a stable functional space for the
Unterberger product on @xmath .

We want now to test the deformation of manifold by action of @xmath . A
somewhat deceiving result that will be shown is that Unterberger’s
deformation of @xmath is not an universal deformation in the sense that
we will find some action of @xmath on manifold for which the action
deformation does not provides a deformation of the manifold.

#### 3.1.1 Action on the dual of its Lie algebra

The action if given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is any point in @xmath . The question is to know if the
product @xmath makes sense when @xmath and @xmath are compactly
supported smooth functions on @xmath . In order to address this
question, we have to check if for every @xmath in @xmath , the function

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

fulfils condition ( 3.12 ). So we consider

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and we compute

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

so

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

The combination @xmath which goes out is precisely @xmath which remains
in the derivative of @xmath . But the derivative of @xmath has compact
support. Hence, in fact, the coefficient @xmath remains constrained in
the domain where the derivative of @xmath does not vanishes. The point
is that the coefficient which go out with derivatives is exactly made of
@xmath and @xmath .

So @xmath is as deformable as @xmath . More precisely, a deformation of
@xmath by action of @xmath is induced by the deformation of @xmath by
Unterberger.

#### 3.1.2 First action on the two dimensional anti de Sitter space

We see @xmath as in B.8.2 and we consider the following action of @xmath
on @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It is easy to see what does this action become in terms of the cylinder:

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

where the adjoint action of @xmath on @xmath is of course trivial. Thus
we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

Notice that only one dimension of @xmath really acts. This action is
thus not the most natural one, but is gives an interesting first toy
model. Using the notations of coordinates ( B.63 ), we consider @xmath
and @xmath , a compact supported function on @xmath and we compute

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

so that if we pose @xmath , we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

When one makes @xmath and @xmath in such a way that @xmath remains
constant, the function @xmath diverges in an exponential way with
respect to @xmath . It contradicts Unterberger’s condition ( 3.12 ).

#### 3.1.3 Second action on the two dimensional anti de Sitter space

Let us now study the more natural action

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is in general very difficult to find, for given @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath , the numbers (unique by construction) @xmath and
@xmath such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In order to simplify the computations, we use the lemma A.21 which
states that we only have to perform the computation for one @xmath in
each orbit. We begin by @xmath , i.e. the orbit of @xmath itself. First,
computations show that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Next,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Comparing with the general form, we find that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

or @xmath . What is important in our deformation problem is the function

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This function of course satisfies the Unterberger condition when @xmath
has a compact support.

The second orbit that we study is the one of @xmath . One has

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If we pose @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , we have to solve the system

  -- -------- -- ---------
                 
     @xmath      (3.17a)
     @xmath      (3.17b)
     @xmath      (3.17c)
     @xmath      (3.17d)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with respect to @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . One can check that the
following is a solution:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.18a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.18b)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.18c)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

If we pose @xmath and @xmath , we have

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.19)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.20)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

The principle of deformation by action of group leads us to deal with
the function

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which should satisfies Unterberger’s condition when @xmath is compactly
supported. Notice that @xmath is a compact variable, so that @xmath can
be non vanishing for all values of @xmath without violate the compact
support requirement. The derivative of @xmath with respect to @xmath
uses the chain rule, and it is apparent the higher order derivatives
have to use the Leibnitz formula:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In order to give an idea of what is going on, here is the first
derivative of @xmath with respect to @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Let us look at the limit @xmath on the line @xmath . If one performs
multiple derivatives of @xmath with respect to @xmath , Leibnitz rules
yields a lot of terms of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

On the line @xmath , the numerator of @xmath is @xmath while the
numerator is a sum and product of monomials of the form @xmath with
@xmath . At the limit, this factor in ( 3.21 ) goes to a finite number.
The factor @xmath is very different because

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which becomes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

on @xmath . It goes to zero when @xmath and @xmath is even, but is goes
to @xmath at the same limit when @xmath is odd. The highest divergence
in all the terms of type ( 3.21 ) in @xmath is expected for maximal
@xmath , so when @xmath . This is a divergence as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Notice that this divergence increases when the order of derivative
increases. Hence it contradicts Unterberger’s condition which works with
parameters @xmath and @xmath who are constant with respect to the order
of the derivative.

### 3.2 Deformation of @xmath

#### 3.2.1 Decomposition as split extension

We try to decompose @xmath as symplectic sum in order to use the
extension lemma. In that purpose, let us consider the change of basis (
B.60 ) in @xmath : @xmath and @xmath .

If @xmath , then @xmath because @xmath must act on @xmath . Hence @xmath
and @xmath remains alone in @xmath . That proves that @xmath . If we
suppose that @xmath , we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

The case @xmath leads to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

The symplectic condition excludes the second decomposition. Indeed for
each @xmath such that @xmath (i.e. @xmath ), we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Hence @xmath . This proves that the decomposition ( 3.23 ) imposes the
symplectic form @xmath to be degenerate. We are left with decomposition
( 3.22 ).

Root space decomposition of @xmath can be found on pages 314–315 of [ 26
] : it has @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . In @xmath , we have @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath , and when we look at @xmath , we have @xmath matrices
@xmath and @xmath . Therefore @xmath is nothing else than the @xmath of
@xmath (recall @xmath ). The analysis shows that @xmath is the @xmath of
@xmath .

#### 3.2.2 Conclusion and perspectives

For our @xmath black hole, the algebra of the group which defines the
singularity is the split extension

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

A deformation of the corresponding groups is given in the article [ 23 ]
, and the extension lemma A.19 yields now an oscillatory integral
universal deformation formula for proper actions of the Iwasawa subgroup
of @xmath . That remark provides an alternative way to deform the black
hole to the one presented in section 2.1 .

The availability of a quantization of @xmath by action of @xmath is an
opportunity to embed our black hole toy model in the framework of
noncommutative geometry. Indeed, the quantization of @xmath is the data
of the anti de Sitter manifold and the action of the group @xmath ; that
is precisely the data which defines the black hole of chapter 1 . So we
would be able to “see” the causal issue from the data of the deformed
spectral triple. Remark that a causal structure (in the physical meaning
of the term) is a special property of pseudo -riemannian manifolds for
which spectral geometry does not exist yet.

An important remaining problem with that method is the fact that the
extension lemma does not assure the existence of a stable functional
space for the new product. So there is still a lot of analytic work to
be done.

## Appendix A Deformations

### a.1 WKB quantization

More details can be found in the article [ 27 ] . A manifold @xmath is
given with its usual commutative and associative algebra @xmath of
smooth functions. A deformation , or a quantization ¹ ¹ 1 In fact, we
make a difference between these two words. A deformation is only the
fact to find a new product from an old one; the new product depends on a
parameter and has to reduce to the old one when the parameter goes to
zero. A quantization is a deformation in which the first order term
(whatever it means) of the new product contains the symplectic structure
as in condition ( A.4 ) below. , of @xmath is the data of a new product
@xmath on a functional space over @xmath .

Let @xmath be a Lie group acting on a manifold @xmath . We consider
@xmath \nomenclature @xmath Functions on the manifold @xmath , the space
of all the maps from @xmath to @xmath , without any regularity
conditions. The regular left representation of @xmath on @xmath is the
representation of @xmath on @xmath given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

for all @xmath , @xmath , @xmath .

#### a.1.1 Definitions and general setting

Let @xmath be an affine symplectic manifold, i.e. a @xmath -dimensional
symplectic manifold @xmath endowed with a torsion-free connection @xmath
such that @xmath . The automorphism group @xmath \nomenclature @xmath
Automorphism group of an affine symplectic manifold is defined as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the group of affine transformations of the affine
manifold @xmath and @xmath is the group of symplectomorphisms of @xmath
.

Let @xmath be a subgroup of @xmath . The following definition of a
@xmath -invariant WKB quantization can be found in [ 14 ] .

###### Definition A.1.

A @xmath -invariant WKB quantization of @xmath is the data of a product

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

(where @xmath is the Liouville measure @xmath ) with the following
constrains:

1.   For each @xmath , we have a space @xmath containing the space
    @xmath of compactly supported smooth functions. The product @xmath
    extends to @xmath in such a way that @xmath becomes a one-parameter
    family of associative @xmath -algebras.

2.   The product @xmath on @xmath is the usual pointwise product and
    @xmath is a Poisson subalgebra of @xmath for the induced Poisson
    structure from the symplectic form @xmath .

3.  @xmath , the space @xmath is a @xmath -vector subspace of @xmath
    such that

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    where the involution @xmath on @xmath is the usual complex
    conjugation.

4.  @xmath is a real valued smooth function @xmath such that for all
    @xmath , the function @xmath has a nondegenerate critical point at
    @xmath .

5.   The functions @xmath are positive real-valued:

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

6.   The functions @xmath and @xmath are invariant under the diagonal
    action of @xmath on @xmath .

7.  @xmath and @xmath with support in a suitably small neighbourhood of
    @xmath , a stationary phase method yields the extension

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (A.3)
      -- -------- -- -------

    where @xmath satisfies

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (A.4)
      -- -------- -- -------

We emphasize the fact that the functional space @xmath is stable under
@xmath : this is a strict quantization in contrast to a formal star
product which only stabilises the space of formal power series of @xmath
.

An example of WKB quantization is the Weyl product which is nothing but
an integral reformulation of the Moyal star product:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath , and @xmath denotes the usual symplectic form on @xmath .

The function @xmath is the kernel of the product @xmath . The
associativity of @xmath on the functional space @xmath is the fact that
the equality

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

holds for every @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . That condition
translates under an integral form to the following relation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the Liouville measure on @xmath . Performing formal
manipulations (such as a Fubini theorem), one can express this condition
as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

That form is easier to handle and to check, but it is meaningless in
general.

The fact to have a left-invariant kernel on a group @xmath means that
the kernel @xmath has the property @xmath , or

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

for every @xmath . The following lemma allows us to use group
isomorphisms to push forward a kernel from a group to another.

###### Lemma A.2.

Let @xmath and @xmath be two symplectic Lie groups and @xmath , a
left-invariant kernel on @xmath which provides an associative product on
the functional space @xmath . Let @xmath be a symplectic Lie group
isomorphism. Then the kernel @xmath is invariant and gives rise to an
associative product on @xmath .

###### Proof.

By definition,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Therefore, using the left-invariance of @xmath , we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

That proves left-invariance of @xmath on @xmath . Now we prove the
associativity of @xmath , this is to check condition ( A.5 ). We have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We perform in this integral the change of variables @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath . This does not affect the measure because @xmath is a
symplectomorphism and @xmath are the Liouville measures on @xmath , so
that for example, @xmath . The previous integral becomes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Using now the associativity of @xmath on @xmath and performing the
inverse change of variables, we find

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which proves the associativity of @xmath on @xmath .

Notice that condition ( A.6 ) can be checked in much the same way.

∎

It is worth noticing that lemma A.2 needs a group isomorphism while one
often only has a Lie algebra isomorphism. Due to
Campbell-Backer-Hausdorff formula, it may be very difficult to find a
group isomorphism from an algebra one.

###### Remark A.3.

Most of the time, the symplectic condition ( A.4 ) does not have to be
checked because we just define the symplectic form @xmath on @xmath as
@xmath where @xmath is the symplectic form on @xmath .

###### Definition A.4.

When @xmath is an action of a Lie group @xmath on a vector space @xmath
, one says that the element @xmath is a differentiable vector of @xmath
if the map @xmath is a differentiable map from @xmath into @xmath .

We are interested in the regular left representation @xmath defined by
@xmath . A function @xmath is a differentiable vector of @xmath when the
map

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath            (A.8)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------

is differentiable. The differential of @xmath is what we will denote by
@xmath in the next few pages: @xmath . By definition,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the element @xmath applied to @xmath is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

We denote by @xmath the space of differentiable vectors of the
representation @xmath .

If one particularises to @xmath (the manifold @xmath being @xmath
itself), the vector fields of @xmath naturally act on @xmath . In
particular, if @xmath and @xmath we have

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

so that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

holds on the space of differentiable vectors @xmath .

###### Definition A.5.

A formal star product @xmath is said to be @xmath -covariant if for all
@xmath , @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . In other words the start product is @xmath -covariant
when the expected terms of higher order in the right hand side are zero.

A crucial use of @xmath -covariance will be done in proposition A.7 in
order to build a map @xmath that fulfils the following proposition
(instead of @xmath itself).

###### Proposition A.6.

In the setting of definition A.1 , the map @xmath is a representation by
derivation of @xmath on @xmath .

###### Proof.

We will not pay attention on the domain @xmath . Its definition will
come later. First, we prove that @xmath is a representation. Indeed,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

Next, @xmath -invariance of @xmath yields

If we derive this equality with respect to @xmath at @xmath , we find

#### a.1.2 Deformation of Iwasawa subgroups

The motivation in deforming (or quantizing) groups resides in the method
of deformation by group action (appendix A.4 ) which states that if one
can deform a group, one can write a formula for a deformed product on
any manifold on which the group acts.

Let first describe the next few steps in the construction of WKB
quantizations of groups. Let @xmath be a semisimple Lie group with its
Iwasawa decomposition @xmath . The group @xmath is solvable and can be
seen as the homogeneous space @xmath . We consider the canonical
multiplicative action @xmath which we restrict to @xmath . We are
interested in a @xmath -invariant quantization of @xmath . Here is a
summary of the notations that will be used.

-   @xmath is the Moyal star product on @xmath endowed with its
    canonical symplectic form,

-   @xmath is the product we are searching for. It has to be defined at
    least on @xmath and should be extended to @xmath ,

-   @xmath must contain @xmath . The purpose is @xmath to be an
    associative algebra and @xmath to be invariant under the left
    regular representation of @xmath ,

-   @xmath is an intermediary space which serves to guess @xmath and
    perform formal manipulations with @xmath and @xmath ,

-   @xmath is the pull-back of Moyal to @xmath . It serves to formal
    manipulations in order to guess the twist that defines @xmath ,

-   @xmath is the product on @xmath . The problem of determining that
    product is formal. When this problem is solved, we have to prove
    that in a well chosen @xmath , taking @xmath yields a solution to
    the problem. As previously noticed, in order to make sense, one has
    to apply @xmath on the subspace @xmath of differentiable vector of
    the regular left representation. We will however not take care of
    this issue in the formal manipulations.

The main steps are the following:

1.  In the case of a WKB product we show in proposition A.6 that @xmath
    is a representation of @xmath on @xmath . Hence we will try to build
    a formal product for which @xmath is a representation by derivation.
    From this point of view, the manipulation with @xmath is only a
    trick designed to guess a product formula.

2.  We suppose that the group @xmath —the one that we are trying to
    quantize— has a symplectic structure @xmath and we consider @xmath ,
    a Darboux chart; i.e. @xmath where @xmath is the canonic symplectic
    form on @xmath .

3.  We suppose that the left action of @xmath on itself is strongly
    hamiltonian and we denote by @xmath the momentum maps. We suppose
    that the Moyal product is @xmath -covariant ² ² 2 In fact, we only
    need the @xmath -covariance. .

4.  We pose @xmath . The @xmath -covariance of @xmath is used in order
    to prove that @xmath is a representation by derivations of @xmath on
    @xmath .

5.  If one can find an intertwining operator between @xmath and @xmath
    (i.e. if they are equivalent representations), we define @xmath as
    the pull-back of @xmath by this intertwining operator. In this case,
    we prove that @xmath is a representation by derivations of the
    product @xmath .

We try now to find a formal product @xmath on @xmath such that @xmath is
a representation by derivations. For this purpose we suppose @xmath to
accept a symplectic structure @xmath and @xmath to be a Darboux chart,
i.e. @xmath where @xmath denotes the canonical symplectic form on @xmath
. Then we bring the Moyal product of @xmath to @xmath by the usual
formula

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

We suppose that product to be @xmath -covariant ³ ³ 3 Only the @xmath
-covariance will be actually used. :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now we consider the left action of @xmath on itself and we suppose that
this is an Hamiltonian action for the symplectic structure @xmath with
dual momentum maps @xmath . We define, for each @xmath , a linear map,
@xmath by

  -- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath            (A.15)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --------

Notice that the formal series of @xmath begins with order one, so the
division by @xmath make sense in the space of formal series. The main
interest of @xmath is to be as we want @xmath to be. So it will be used
to guess how to twist the product in order to make @xmath work as @xmath
.

###### Proposition A.7.

The map @xmath is a representation of @xmath on @xmath , and @xmath is a
derivation of @xmath for each @xmath .

###### Proof.

The proof that @xmath is a representation is only to check that the
relation @xmath holds for any @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . Using the
@xmath -covariance and the Jacobi identity,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

It remains to check that @xmath for every @xmath . This is once again
just a computation.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

∎

Notice that the @xmath -covariance of @xmath was used to prove that
@xmath is a representation. Now, if we could show that @xmath , then the
answer to our deformation problem would be @xmath and @xmath . But
instead of that we have @xmath because

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the notion of fundamental field @xmath is taken for the regular
left representation (which is Hamiltonian). That shows that @xmath is
something like a deformation of @xmath . As a consequence, one has
@xmath , or

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

(see subsection B.12.3 ).

Since @xmath is not @xmath , the hope is to see if @xmath and @xmath
should be equivalent representations. As next proposition shows, the
fact to find an equivalence between @xmath and @xmath actually solves
the problem to find a product for which @xmath is a representation by
derivation.

###### Proposition A.8.

Let @xmath be an intertwining operator between @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

If we define the star product @xmath by

  -- -- -- --------
           (A.21)
  -- -- -- --------

@xmath becomes a derivation of @xmath .

###### Proof.

If we develop the expression of @xmath , we find @xmath , using the fact
that @xmath is a derivation of @xmath , one easily finds @xmath . ∎

### a.2 Deformation of @xmath

#### a.2.1 Actions and Symplectic structure

Here, in contrast with the case studied in B.12.4 , we are working with
adjoint orbits (and not the co adjoint orbits), so the subalgebra to be
studied is no more @xmath but

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the symplectic form is not exactly ( B.90 ), but

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

The action of @xmath on @xmath is @xmath . The corresponding notion of
fundamental field is given by

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

The Iwasawa theorem B.9 claims that @xmath and that we have global
diffeomorphism @xmath , @xmath ; @xmath , @xmath ; @xmath , @xmath . We
define @xmath and the global diffeomorphism

  -- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath            (A.23)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --------

That map can also be seen as

  -- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath            (A.24)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --------

In this way, we identify @xmath and @xmath as two dimensional space.

###### Proposition A.9.

As homogeneous space, there is a double covering

  -- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath            (A.25)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --------

###### Proof.

The map @xmath is well defined and injective (up to the double covering)
because the stabilizer of @xmath is @xmath . The surjective condition is
clear. The double covering is expressed by the fact that @xmath if and
only if @xmath . ∎

The symplectic @xmath -form @xmath on @xmath induces a symplectic form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

on @xmath .

###### Proposition A.10.

The @xmath -form @xmath is constant and its value is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

in other words, @xmath is a Darboux chart for @xmath .

###### Proof.

We have to compute

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

First, we show that @xmath :

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

In the same way, we find @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath            
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

Using formula ( A.22 ) for the symplectic form,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

Defining @xmath we write it as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

∎

So, as symplectic manifold, @xmath is nothing but @xmath , the
diffeomorphism being @xmath . The symplectic structure @xmath induces a
Poisson structure @xmath given by equation ( B.85 ). In the present
case, it reads

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (A.28)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

The action of @xmath on @xmath can be turned into an action on @xmath
using the chart @xmath . It is done by defining @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

or @xmath . The notion of fundamental field at @xmath is thus given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

for which we will often use the path representation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

From @xmath -invariance of @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus the symplectic form is @xmath -invariant:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

That implies in particular that @xmath satisfies theorem B.19 .

###### Proposition A.11.

The action @xmath of @xmath on the symplectic space @xmath is
Hamiltonian and the dual momentum maps @xmath are given by (cf . B.20 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

for each @xmath .

###### Proof.

We have first to check the identity @xmath . Let us apply both sides on
the vector @xmath , with @xmath and @xmath . On the one hand

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

but

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

The same being true for @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

On the other hand,

  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath                            (A.35)
                       @xmath                   
                                @xmath          
                       @xmath                   
                       @xmath   @xmath @xmath   
                       @xmath                   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------- --------

That proves that @xmath . The second part of the proof is to see that
condition ( B.87b ) holds. Using the fact that @xmath , we find

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the star refers to the action on @xmath . Explicit computations of
Poisson bracket between @xmath ’s at page A.42 will confirm that result.

∎

We are now able to furnish explicit formulas for @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath by virtue of the latter proposition. The first computation is:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath            (A.36)
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --------

so

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

Second,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

The last one is

  -- -------- -- -------- --------
     @xmath               (A.40)
                 @xmath   
                 @xmath   
                 @xmath   
                 @xmath   
  -- -------- -- -------- --------

Finally,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using formula ( B.86 ) for the Poisson bracket, one can check that the
required relations ( B.87b ) are satisfied:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.42a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.42b)
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.42c)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

This confirms the fact that our action of @xmath on @xmath is
Hamiltonian.

Using the global diffeomorphism ( A.23 ), and the map

  -- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath            (A.43)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --------

we identify

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The action of @xmath on itself induced from the adjoint action of @xmath
on @xmath is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It is the left multiplicative action required in definition A.1 . The
Lie group @xmath is endowed with the symplectic form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The notion of fundamental vector for the action of @xmath on itself is
given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

but we know that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If @xmath , then @xmath and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the fundamental field of the right hand side is taken in the sense
of the action of @xmath on @xmath .

The following proposition shows that the explicit form of @xmath and
@xmath are the same up to natural identifications.

###### Proposition A.12.

The left multiplicative action of @xmath on itself is Hamiltonian and
the dual momentum maps are given by @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

for each @xmath .

###### Proof.

Once again, the proof is just a verification of the two properties of a
momentum map. The first one is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

For the second condition, we consider @xmath and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

while

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

∎

#### a.2.2 Guessing the star product

The Moyal star product is invariant under the action of @xmath on itself
@xmath in the sense that if we pose @xmath it is clear that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

We are however not interested by that action on @xmath . The action
which we look at is the one of @xmath .

###### Proposition A.13.

The product @xmath is @xmath -invariant at order @xmath and @xmath .

###### Proof.

The invariance at order zero is given with some concise notations by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The action @xmath of an element @xmath satisfies @xmath (equation ( A.32
)), so theorem B.19 gives @xmath . Since Poisson bracket is the first
term of the Moyal product, at first order

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

∎

###### Proposition A.14.

The product @xmath is @xmath -covariant for the homomorphism given by
proposition A.11 or equivalently by equations ( A.37 ), ( A.39 ), and (
A.41 ).

###### Proof.

The Moyal star product can be written as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with @xmath where @xmath and @xmath are summed over @xmath -uple of
@xmath and @xmath , including a sum over @xmath itself ( @xmath , @xmath
). For a given @xmath , there is only one @xmath such that @xmath .
There are @xmath multi-indices @xmath providing the term @xmath with
@xmath . For each of them, @xmath . Therefore

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

For example,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If @xmath is even, the expression ( A.50 ) is symmetric with respect of
@xmath and @xmath , so that these terms will not contribute in the
computation of the commutators @xmath . We are left with

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

First we compute @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

thus

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

By the way, we point out the relation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now, we turn our attention to the commutator @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

thus

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

so that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Last we check @xmath . When @xmath , the only non vanishing term in the
sum ( A.55 ) is @xmath . Since @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

but

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

∎

Before to go on, let us compute the operator @xmath in order to complete
our collection. We take once again the formula ( A.50 ), with @xmath and
@xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is clear that @xmath can be derived only two times with respect of
@xmath and as much as we want with respect of @xmath . Then possible
@xmath are @xmath , whose corresponding @xmath are @xmath , @xmath , and
@xmath . Some computations lead to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

Replacing into the series ( A.51 ), we find

  -- -------- -- --
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- --

Finally,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Corollary A.15.

The star product @xmath on @xmath defined for @xmath by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is covariant for the functions @xmath of proposition A.12 .

Remark that from general theory of star products, the so-defined @xmath
is a formal star product on @xmath .

###### Proof.

From definition of @xmath , on the one hand

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

while on the other hand, @xmath , so that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

∎

All that makes the theory developed earlier, and in particular
proposition A.8 , valid here. So we pose

  -- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath            (A.61)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --------

using the explicit expressions of @xmath , we find

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (A.62)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Using ( A.19 ) with @xmath , it is clear that @xmath . Therefore

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.63)
  -- -------- -- --------

but the requested identity @xmath will not hold. The problem is that
@xmath is a vector field, while @xmath comes with (infinitely) multiple
derivatives, hence this is not a vector field. Conclusion: the operator
@xmath of equation ( A.20 ) must not act on the variable @xmath .

First we consider a partial Fourier transform @xmath \nomenclature
@xmath Fourier transform:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

the inverse being given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.65)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is clear that @xmath , but @xmath . Indeed, if we define @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is nothing but the fact that the Fourier transform turns a
derivation into a multiplication.

As can be seen on an asymptotic development, the deformation @xmath
parameter is necessarily purely imaginary, then we can here pose @xmath
with @xmath , so that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using ( A.19 ), we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.68)
  -- -------- -- --------

Comparing it with the expression of @xmath , we see that (up to constant
factor) we have to act in such a way that @xmath is converted into a
derivation. This is done by a Fourier transform. We pose @xmath and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

As usual,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This suggests us to consider the change of variable

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and finally,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.69)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is defined by @xmath . The result of our construction is
the following which proves that we are in the situation of proposition
A.8 .

###### Theorem A.16.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

Notice that @xmath , and then define @xmath ; equation ( A.67 ) is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Applying @xmath on the right hand side, we find @xmath . This allows us
to compute

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

∎

#### a.2.3 Formula for the product

The fact the @xmath intertwines @xmath and @xmath makes that the
candidate to be a product on the @xmath of @xmath can be computed using
formula ( A.21 ). Computations are rather long and done in the articles
[ 14 ] and [ 23 ] (see particularly point 4), so we will not give them
here. We will also not precise the functional space of convergence for
the resulting product.

In the parametrization

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

of @xmath the form @xmath is a left-invariant measure, so the integral
of the function @xmath on @xmath is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Remark that @xmath is the Liouville measure by proposition A.10 . It is
important for definition A.1 .

We consider a subset @xmath , and we define the product @xmath on @xmath
by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.70)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.71a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.71b)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Here, the symbol @xmath stands for a cyclic sum over the indices @xmath
.

##### Remark on (formal) star product

One can find a definition of an asymptotic development for oscillating
integrals in [ 28 ] under the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It can be shown that such a development used on ( A.70 ) gives rise of a
formal star product:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.72)
  -- -------- -- --------

### a.3 Extension lemma

Let @xmath be symplectic Lie algebras and @xmath the respective Lie
groups with left-invariant symplectic forms: @xmath . We suppose to know
a homomorphism @xmath and a Darboux chart @xmath for each of the two
symplectic Lie groups. Our first purpose is to build a Darboux chart on
the split extension

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Remark A.17.

Most of the time we are in the inverse situation: we have an algebra
@xmath which turn out to be a split extension @xmath for which we have
to check that @xmath is a symplectic action of @xmath on @xmath . See
the example of section 3.2 .

###### Proposition A.18.

In this setting, the map @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.73)
  -- -------- -- --------

is a Darboux chart.

###### Proof.

An element @xmath is denoted by @xmath with @xmath , and the symplectic
form on @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.74)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we identify @xmath and @xmath . Let @xmath and @xmath belongs to
@xmath . We have to show that the quantity

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.75)
  -- -------- -- --------

does not depend on @xmath .

The vector @xmath is represented by a path @xmath with @xmath . In order
to characterise that path, we want first to know precisely what is
@xmath . Since @xmath , the path must fulfil @xmath , or

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.76)
  -- -------- -- --------

We denote @xmath and @xmath . The relation between @xmath and @xmath is
@xmath . In particular, it is wrong to say “ @xmath , thus @xmath ”.
This point being clear,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.77)
  -- -------- -- --------

If one particularises to the case @xmath , that is @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.78)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath , we have @xmath , and the first argument of @xmath in
equation ( A.75 ) is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If we write that in terms of the derivative of the path @xmath , what we
get in the derivative is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.79)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath , the derivative of that term is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.80)
  -- -------- -- --------

with some abuse between @xmath and @xmath . Doing the same computation
with @xmath (so that @xmath ), we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.81)
  -- -------- -- --------

and what appears in @xmath reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.82)
  -- -------- -- --------

Finally, for @xmath and @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.83)
  -- -------- -- --------

The first argument belongs to @xmath (because @xmath ) while the second
belongs to @xmath . Hence definition ( A.74 ) makes the right hand side
vanishing.

If we want to compute equation ( A.83 ) with @xmath , @xmath ,

  -- -- -- --------
           (A.84)
  -- -- -- --------

At this point, notice that @xmath . Indeed the exponential @xmath being
surjective , there exists a @xmath such that @xmath . Now, @xmath by
assumption, so that @xmath . The previous expression becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.85)
  -- -------- -- --------

The last line is the fact that @xmath is a Darboux chart: @xmath . The
case with @xmath , @xmath yields to compute

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It is done by the same way as the previous cases. ∎

A direct computation shows the following extension lemma .

###### Lemma A.19 (Extension lemma).

Let @xmath be a left-invariant three point kernel on @xmath ( @xmath ).
Assume that @xmath is invariant under conjugation by elements of @xmath
. Then @xmath is left-invariant (under @xmath ).

###### Proof.

An element of @xmath has the form @xmath with @xmath , the
multiplication being given by @xmath . Using this rule, the definition
of the tensor product, and the left-invariance of both @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

∎

This lemma shows that if one has kernels on @xmath and @xmath satisfying
the above hypotheses, their tensor product provides a kernel for an
associative left-invariant kernel on @xmath . Proposition A.18 allows us
to hope that the product on @xmath will satisfy the same kind of
symplectic compatibility as the products on @xmath ; in particular when
the latter were constructed using Darboux chart in the same way as the
product described in section A.2 .

### a.4 Deformation by group action

The procedure of deformation by group action is described in [ 29 ] .
Let @xmath be a Lie group. We suppose to know a subset @xmath of @xmath
such that

1.  @xmath is invariant under the left regular representation of @xmath
    on itself,

2.  @xmath is provided with a @xmath -invariant product @xmath
    \nomenclature @xmath Star product on @xmath such that @xmath is an
    associative algebra. The @xmath -invariance means that @xmath ,

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

Notice that we do not impose any regularity condition on this product.
The reason is that the deformation by group action is a formal procedure
which allows to guess a product on a manifold. The “true” work to prove
convergences and invariances has to be done on the level of the deformed
manifold.

Now, let @xmath be a manifold endowed with a right action @xmath of
@xmath . For @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , we consider @xmath and @xmath
defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.86)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the following functional space on @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For example, the @xmath corresponding to @xmath is the whole @xmath .
For @xmath , @xmath , we define @xmath \nomenclature @xmath Star product
on @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.87)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the identity of @xmath .

###### Theorem A.20.

The product ( A.87 ) obtained by action of the group @xmath on the
manifold @xmath fulfils the following properties:

1.   The operation @xmath intertwines the products @xmath and @xmath :

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

2.  @xmath is stable under @xmath ,

3.  @xmath is an associative algebra.

###### Proof.

First remark that @xmath because

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It follows that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.88)
  -- -------- -- --------

The first point is proved.

Using the first point, we see that @xmath belongs to @xmath because
@xmath and @xmath is stable under @xmath . So we have the second point.
For the third one,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The conclusion follows from associativity of @xmath . ∎

Let us summarize what was done up to now. When @xmath acts on @xmath ,
and when we have a “good” product on @xmath , we are able to build an
associative product on @xmath . The space @xmath is defined by @xmath
and the action. So a deformation of a group gives rise to a deformation
of any manifold on which the group acts. This is why we call it an
“universal” deformation. That universal construction is the motivation
to deform groups.

###### Lemma A.21.

A function @xmath belongs to @xmath if and only if there exists one
@xmath such that @xmath in each @xmath -orbit in @xmath .

###### Proof.

The necessary condition is direct because, when @xmath , the function
@xmath belongs to @xmath for every @xmath . For the sufficient
condition, suppose @xmath , then @xmath for all @xmath because @xmath is
left-invariant. If it holds for a @xmath in each @xmath -orbit, then
@xmath for all @xmath . ∎

The content of this lemma is that if one wants to check if a given
function @xmath belongs to @xmath , one only has to check is @xmath for
one @xmath in each @xmath -orbit.

The functions @xmath are not “gentle” functions, even when @xmath is.
Let us give two examples of pathology that can occur in @xmath without
to be present in @xmath . Firstly, if the action is the identity, the
support of @xmath is the whole @xmath which can be non compact. So, even
when @xmath is compactly supported, there are no guarantee with respect
to the support of @xmath .

Secondly, the function @xmath is of course bounded; but the derivatives
are not specially such. Indeed, in order to fix ideas, suppose that the
group @xmath is a two parameter group and that the manifold @xmath is a
two dimensional manifold. In this case, one can write

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.89)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a parameter in the functions @xmath . Depending on the
action, the function @xmath can be very odd. In particular, the
derivatives

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

in which @xmath can be divergent. Even worse, the degree of the
divergence can increase with the degree of the derivation. Two examples
of such a hill behaviour are given in section 3.1 .

### a.5 One dimensional split extensions of Heisenberg algebras

#### a.5.1 Introduction

The one dimensional extensions of Heisenberg algebras are classified by
triples @xmath . The quantization in the case @xmath reveals to be a
particular case of the one studied in [ 23 ] , while quantization of
other extensions can be found using symmetries of the kernel. Here we
are reporting results of [ 16 ] and most of proofs (in particular the
trick of subsection A.5.6 which allows to extend the known product to
every one dimensional split extensions) are due to Y. Voglaire. It is to
be published in his future PhD thesis.

The kernel of the quantization of [ 23 ] will be denoted by @xmath .
Then we will give a way to twist @xmath in order to obtain a kernel
@xmath on any extension of the form @xmath . Quantizations of other
extensions can be obtained by composing with Lie group isomorphisms. The
kernel for an arbitrary extension is denoted by @xmath , or simply
@xmath when there are no possible ambiguity.

When we will deal with the anti de Sitter situation, our starting point
will be this @xmath that we will have to adapt to another symplectic
form that @xmath invoking lemma A.29 .

#### a.5.2 General definitions

Let @xmath be the Heisenberg algebra of dimension @xmath , with a
natural symplectic structure defined from the Heisenberg algebra
structure:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for all @xmath , @xmath . Now we consider a one dimensional algebra
@xmath generated by an element @xmath , and we build the split extension
of @xmath by @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.90)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the split homomorphism is an action by derivation @xmath . The so
obtained algebra is what we call a one dimensional extension of
Heisenberg algebra . Let us study the possibilities for @xmath . From
linearity, its general form is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . Since @xmath , the fact that
@xmath is a derivation of @xmath , implies that @xmath because

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.91)
  -- -------- -- --------

Thus we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.92)
  -- -------- -- --------

From commutation relations in @xmath , we easily find

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Applying @xmath to this equality, and using the fact that this is a
derivation, we find

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which can be rewritten as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.93)
  -- -------- -- --------

In conclusion, the endomorphism @xmath is given by a triple @xmath with
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath . Using this result, we write the general
commutator on @xmath under the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.94)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we adopted the notation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.95)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### a.5.3 Symplectic structure

The following proposition gives a symplectic structure on @xmath .

###### Proposition A.22.

The algebra @xmath endowed with

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.96)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the star denotes the Chevalley cocycle defined by ( B.91 ) is
symplectic if and only if @xmath .

###### Proof.

It is evident that @xmath is closed because it is exact. For
non-degeneracy, we compute

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

whose determinant is @xmath which is non vanishing if and only if @xmath
.

∎

This symplectic algebra is denoted by @xmath , or simply @xmath when
there are no possible confusions.

Since we are only interested in symplectic algebras, we suppose @xmath
and we look at extensions of type @xmath with @xmath . The bracket is
given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.97)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### a.5.4 Isomorphisms

The extension obtained by the derivation @xmath is a priori not the same
as the one obtained by @xmath . Two extensions are isomorphic when there
exists a linear bijection @xmath such that ⁴ ⁴ 4 the reason why we write
@xmath instead of @xmath comes from the fact that we will be interested
in the corresponding group isomorphism later.

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.98a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.98b)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

We find the following isomorphisms:

-   @xmath by

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (A.99a)
      -- -------- -- ---------

-   @xmath by

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (A.99b)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    where @xmath is the vector of @xmath satisfying @xmath ,

-   @xmath by

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (A.99c)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    where @xmath fulfills @xmath or, equivalently,

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

The third isomorphism only gives the equivalence between @xmath and
@xmath when they belongs to the same orbit of the adjoint action of
@xmath . In particular, there are no isomorphisms between the identity
and anything else.

#### a.5.5 Reminder about a previous deformation

Before going on with the construction of a deformation of one
dimensional split extensions of Heisenberg algebras, we have to recall a
result on deformation in @xmath . The product on the extension of
Heisenberg algebra will be nothing else than a transport of this one.

The article [ 23 ] provides a formal universal deformation formula for
the actions of the Iwasawa component @xmath of @xmath under an
oscillatory integral form. It turns out (see [ 27 ] ) that this
deformation formula is in fact non-formal for proper actions on
topological spaces.

Here is the precise result. The Iwasawa decomposition of @xmath induces
the identification @xmath . The group @xmath is endowed with a (family
of) left-invariant symplectic structure(s) ⁵ ⁵ 5 This is done using the
hermitian symmetric structure, cf proposition 1.1 in [ 23 ] . @xmath .
If we denote by @xmath the Lie algebra of @xmath , the map

  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath            (A.100)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------

reveals to be a global Darboux chart for @xmath . The nilpotent
component appears to accept a decomposition @xmath in which the Lie
bracket reads

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

the full Iwasawa component is now parametrized by @xmath . The interest
of this situation resides in the fact that the algebra @xmath turns out
to be a one dimensional split extension of an Heisenberg algebra;
namely,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The deformation result is the following.

###### Theorem A.23.

For every non-zero @xmath , there exists a Fréchet function space @xmath
satisfying the inclusions @xmath , such that, defining for all @xmath

  -- -- -- ---------
           (A.101)
  -- -- -- ---------

where

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

with @xmath is the phase for the Weyl product on @xmath and @xmath
stands for cyclic summation, one has:

1.  @xmath is smooth and the map @xmath extends to an associative
    product on @xmath . The pair @xmath is a (pre- @xmath ) Fréchet
    algebra.

2.   In coordinates @xmath the group multiplication law reads

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    The phase and amplitude occurring in formula ( A.101 ) are both
    invariant under the left action @xmath .

3.   Formula ( A.101 ) admits a formal asymptotic expansion of the form:

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    where @xmath denotes the symplectic Poisson bracket on @xmath
    associated with @xmath . The full series yields an associative
    formal star product on @xmath denoted by @xmath .

The setting and 1. and 2. may be found in [ 23 ] , while 3. is a
straightforward adaptation to @xmath of [ 27 ] .

This theorem among with the isomorphisms given in A.5.4 only provide a
product on extensions of type @xmath . But we saw that the extensions
@xmath with @xmath are different. Hence the generalization of this
result to other extensions is not straightforward. We address now this
question.

#### a.5.6 Extensions with non trivial @xmath

The group @xmath is provided with a kernel @xmath by theorem A.23 . The
symplectic group @xmath acts on @xmath by

  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath            (A.102)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------

where

  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath            (A.103)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------

is the Iwasawa coordinate on @xmath .

###### Proposition A.24.

The kernel @xmath is invariant under this action: @xmath .

###### Proof.

We are looking on the kernel in expression ( A.101 ). The amplitude of
@xmath , i.e. all what lies outside the exponential, and the cyclic sum
in the phase only depend on the @xmath ’s. So @xmath does not act on
them. As far as @xmath is concerned, up to coefficients which only
depend on the @xmath ’s, it is a sum of elements of the form @xmath . ∎

Let @xmath be a matrix such that @xmath and @xmath . We consider @xmath
, the one dimensional subalgebra of @xmath generated by @xmath and we
define

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (A.104)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We denote by @xmath and @xmath the corresponding groups. We have in
particular @xmath . An element of @xmath has the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (A.105)
  -- -------- -- ---------

###### Proposition A.25.

The group @xmath is a subgroup of @xmath .

###### Proof.

We will prove that @xmath is isomorphic to a subalgebra of @xmath ,
namely, the subalgebra @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the splitting homomorphism ( A.92 ) of @xmath , which in
the present case reads @xmath . In other words, the algebra @xmath is
made of elements of the form ( A.105 ) with @xmath . The isomorphism is

  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath            (A.106)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------

Indeed, using formula ( A.97 ) with @xmath and @xmath , we find

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

∎

From now on, we identify @xmath with @xmath by the isomorphism @xmath
which will no longer be explicitly written. Image of @xmath in @xmath by
the isomorphism are elements of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since the elements @xmath and @xmath commute in @xmath , we can
decompose an element @xmath as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The element @xmath seen in @xmath will be denoted by @xmath as well

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We consider the following coordinate on @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath            (A.107)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------

###### Proposition A.26.

The group @xmath is diffeomorphic to the homogeneous space @xmath .

###### Proof.

We will prove that @xmath acts simply transitively on @xmath . Let us
look at

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (A.108)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Noticing that @xmath we find

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In @xmath , by definition of @xmath , we have @xmath , thus @xmath . So,
in order to get the element @xmath , we have to act on @xmath with the
element @xmath . All that proves that the map

  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath            (A.109)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------

is a diffeomorphism. ∎

The work done up to now provides a diffeomorphism

  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath            (A.110)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------

which has suitable properties listed in the proposition below.

###### Proposition A.27.

This map @xmath has the following properties:

1.   if @xmath in the sense of decomposition ( A.108 ),

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (A.111)
      -- -------- -- ---------

2.   the differential fulfils

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (A.112)
      -- -------- -- ---------

3.   if @xmath is the left-invariant symplectic form on @xmath and
    @xmath the one on @xmath , we have

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    in other words, @xmath is a symplectomorphism.

###### Proof.

The first point is a computation:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

When @xmath , we have @xmath and @xmath , so the result is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

That concludes the proof of the first point. For the second statement,
we have @xmath , so

  -- -- -- ---------
           (A.113)
  -- -- -- ---------

For the third point, we denote by @xmath and @xmath the neutral of
@xmath and @xmath . On the one hand,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

on the other hand, @xmath . Hence, in order to have @xmath , it is
necessary that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

But, for @xmath , we have

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

The first property yields

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since @xmath is invariant under @xmath , it remains to be proved that
@xmath . This is true because, in these coordinates, both sides applied
on vectors @xmath and @xmath give

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

so @xmath is a symplectomorphism.

∎

Now, if @xmath is the kernel on @xmath , we define the kernel on @xmath
by

  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath            (A.114)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------

###### Theorem A.28.

The kernel @xmath is

-    left-invariant under @xmath ,

-    associative on @xmath .

###### Proof.

For left-invariance, let @xmath . We have

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

because of left-invariance of @xmath under @xmath and its invariance
under @xmath . Associativity can be checked in much the same way as in
lemma A.2 . ∎

Let @xmath and @xmath . By proposition A.24 , the kernel @xmath on
@xmath is invariant under @xmath , i.e. @xmath for all @xmath . The
action of @xmath on @xmath is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Define the map @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (A.115)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which fulfils

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, using the @xmath -invariance of @xmath , we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This proves that @xmath is also invariant under @xmath too.

#### a.5.7 Jump from one kernel to another

We have a kernel for the extensions @xmath and @xmath . We can consider
the isomorphism @xmath which is the lift of

  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath            (A.116)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------

If @xmath is a kernel on @xmath , then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is a kernel on @xmath .

An action @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (A.117)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is given by equation ( A.115 ). By lemma A.2 , the kernel
@xmath is left-invariant under the action of @xmath and invariant under
the following action of @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Lemma A.29.

Let @xmath and @xmath be two exact forms on @xmath such that @xmath and
@xmath belong to the same coadjoint orbit: there exists a @xmath such
that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (A.118)
  -- -------- -- ---------

A solution of the problem to find an automorphism @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (A.119)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for all @xmath and @xmath , @xmath is given by @xmath .

###### Proof.

Transported to the identity, the condition ( A.119 ) becomes:

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

If @xmath , we are searching for a @xmath such that

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

Since @xmath is a group isomorphism, @xmath and the constraint on @xmath
becomes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath

A solution is therefore

### b.1 Connectedness of some usual groups

#### b.1.1 General results

The following is a general result about Lie groups:

###### Lemma B.1.

If @xmath is a Lie group and @xmath is its identity component, the
connected components of @xmath are lateral classes of @xmath . More
specifically, if @xmath , then @xmath .

An other general result is lemma 2.4 of [ 30 ] states that

###### Lemma B.2.

Connectedness of some usual groups:

-    The groups @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath are all
    connected.

-    The group @xmath ( @xmath ) has exactly two connected components.

We are not going to prove this lemma here. Instead, we give some detail
on the geometric nature of the two connected components of @xmath ; a
physical discussion in the case of @xmath can be found in the reference
[ 31 ] . What is proved in [ 30 ] is that @xmath is homeomorphic to the
topological product

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

for some @xmath . Hence an element of @xmath reads

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath , @xmath , @xmath are such that @xmath . The @xmath part
corresponds to boost while @xmath and @xmath correspond to pure temporal
and pure spatial rotations. An element of @xmath has always determinant
equals to @xmath . Therefore one can decompose the rotation part as
@xmath . Both parts are connected.

Hence the first connected component contains @xmath while the second one
contains the element that simultaneously changes the sign of one spacial
and one temporal direction.

#### b.1.2 The quotient for anti de Sitter

Homogeneous space considerations (see section B.9 ) will naturally lead
us to define the anti de Sitter space as the quotient @xmath while the
black hole definition (section 1.2 ) needs to consider Iwasawa
decompositions of @xmath . So we face the problem that the Iwasawa
theorem B.9 only works with connected groups. In order to prevent any
problems of this type, we prove now that, if @xmath and @xmath denote
the identity component of @xmath and @xmath respectively, then @xmath .

The groups that are considered here have only two connected components
@xmath and @xmath . We can chose @xmath such that @xmath . Using lemma
B.1 , it easy to prove that

-   @xmath ,

-   @xmath ,

-   @xmath .

For the last one, take @xmath and @xmath in @xmath . Then consider
@xmath and @xmath in @xmath such that @xmath and @xmath . If @xmath and
@xmath are path from @xmath to @xmath and @xmath , then the path @xmath
is a path from @xmath to @xmath .

###### Proposition B.3.

The map

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath            (B.1)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------

where we define @xmath when @xmath or @xmath when @xmath is a
diffeomorphism. The classes are @xmath and @xmath .

###### Proof.

First we prove that @xmath is well defined. For that we suppose that
@xmath . There are three cases:

1.  The elements @xmath and @xmath both belong to @xmath . In this case,
    @xmath with @xmath and @xmath .

2.  The element @xmath belongs to @xmath while @xmath belongs to @xmath
    . In this case, @xmath with @xmath and @xmath . Then @xmath and
    @xmath .

3.  The case with @xmath and @xmath in @xmath is similar.

The fact that the map @xmath is surjective is clear. For injectivity,
let @xmath , i.e. there exists a @xmath in @xmath such that @xmath .
Thus we have @xmath with @xmath following the cases. Then @xmath in
which @xmath belongs to @xmath , so that @xmath .

∎

### b.2 Iwasawa decomposition of Lie groups

In this section, we show the main steps of the Iwasawa decomposition for
a semisimple Lie group. We will by the way fix certain notations. For
proofs, the reader will see [ 26 ] VI.4 and [ 18 ] III,§ 3,4 and VI,§ 3.
In the whole section, @xmath denotes a semisimple group, and @xmath its
real Lie algebra. The two main examples that are widely used during the
thesis are @xmath and @xmath .

#### b.2.1 Cartan decomposition

###### Definition B.4.

An involutive automorphism @xmath on a real semi simple Lie algebra
@xmath for which the form @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

( @xmath is the Killing form on @xmath ) is positive definite is a
Cartan involution .

###### Proposition B.5.

There exists a Cartan involution for every real semisimple Lie algebra.

See [ 18 ] , theorem 4.1. Since @xmath , the eigenvalues of a Cartan
involution are @xmath , and we can define the Cartan decomposition
@xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

into @xmath -eigenspaces of @xmath in such a way that @xmath . These
eigenspaces are subject to the following commutation relations:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

The dimension of of maximal abelian subalgebra of @xmath is the rank of
@xmath . One can prove that it does not depend on the choices (Cartan
involution and maximal abelian subalgebra). Let @xmath be one of such
maximal abelian subalgebras.

###### Lemma B.6.

The set of operators @xmath is an abelian algebra and the elements are
self-adjoint.

#### b.2.2 Root space decomposition

From the lemma, the operators @xmath with @xmath are simultaneously
diagonalisable. There exists a basis @xmath of @xmath and linear maps
@xmath such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For any @xmath , we define

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

Elements @xmath such that @xmath are called restricted roots of @xmath .
The set of restricted roots is denoted by @xmath , and have the
important property to span (among with @xmath itself) the whole space:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

see [ 18 ] theorem 4.2 for a proof. This decomposition is called the
restricted root space decomposition . Other properties of the root
spaces are listed in the following proposition.

###### Proposition B.7.

The spaces @xmath satisfy also:

1.  @xmath ,

2.  @xmath ; in particular, when @xmath belongs to @xmath , @xmath
    belongs to @xmath too,

3.  @xmath orthogonally.

#### b.2.3 Iwasawa decomposition

###### Definition B.8.

Let @xmath be a vector space. A positivity notion (see [ 26 ] ,
page 154) is the data of a subset @xmath of @xmath such that

1.   for any nonzero @xmath , @xmath xor @xmath ,

2.   for any @xmath , @xmath and any @xmath , the elements @xmath and
    @xmath are positive.

A positive element of @xmath is an element of @xmath . When @xmath is
positive, we note @xmath . Let us consider a notion of positivity on
@xmath and denote by @xmath the set of positive roots. We define

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

The Iwasawa decomposition is given by the following theorem ( [ 26 ] ,
theorem 5.12):

###### Theorem B.9.

Let @xmath be a linear connected semisimple group and @xmath , @xmath
where @xmath and @xmath are the previously defined algebras. Then @xmath
, @xmath and @xmath are simply connected subgroups of @xmath and the
multiplication map

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath            (B.8)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------

is a global diffeomorphism. In particular, the Lie algebra @xmath
decomposes as vector space direct sum

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

The group @xmath is a solvable subgroup of @xmath which is called the
Iwasawa group, or Iwasawa component of @xmath .

Notice that @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are unique up to isomorphism.
Their matricial representation of course depend on choices.

### b.3 Introduction to homogeneous spaces

Most of the material of this section can be found in a more general
framework in the references [ 18 , 32 , 33 , 17 ] .

#### b.3.1 Fundamental and invariant fields

Let @xmath be a Lie group with Lie algebra @xmath . For each element of
@xmath , there are two distinguished vector fields on @xmath , the
left-invariant and the right-invariant one:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.10)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.11)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

When @xmath is a Lie group with an action on the manifold @xmath denoted
by

  -- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath            (B.12)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --------

we define the fundamental vector field associated with @xmath on the
point @xmath by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

An usual case is the one of a Lie group acting on itself for which we
have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### b.3.2 Homogeneous spaces

An homogeneous space is a differentiable manifold which posses a
transitive diffeomorphism group. An important class of homogeneous
spaces are quotients @xmath of a Lie group @xmath by a closed subgroup
@xmath . In this case, we use the classes at right:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the action at left:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The canonic projection is @xmath and we denote @xmath . We will only
deal with this kind of homogeneous spaces. The Lie algebras of @xmath
and @xmath are denoted by @xmath and @xmath respectively.

One know that (almost) every homogeneous space is of this kind in the
following way. Let @xmath be a homogeneous space and @xmath , a point of
@xmath . We consider @xmath , a group which acts transitively on @xmath
(in particular, @xmath ) and @xmath , the subgroup of @xmath which fixes
@xmath . Then, one proves that the map @xmath is a homogeneous space
isomorphism between @xmath and @xmath .

One can prove that @xmath , and from the very definition of the objects,
one has

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

For sake of simplicity, we will use the notation @xmath .

The homogeneous space @xmath is endowed with its natural topology which
is defined by the requirement that the projection @xmath is continuous
and open. We refer to [ 18 ] for the properties of that topology.

###### Definition B.10.

The homogeneous space @xmath is reductive is there exists a subspace
@xmath of @xmath such that

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --

###### Proposition B.11.

In an reductive homogeneous space, the restriction of the projection
@xmath is an isomorphism.

###### Proof.

The map @xmath is of course surjective; then, since @xmath is the
kernel, @xmath must be surjective too. Now, if we have @xmath for @xmath
, @xmath , the difference @xmath must belongs to the kernel of @xmath
which is nothing but @xmath . This situation is impossible because
@xmath is a direct sum. ∎

We can generalize this proposition by considering the space @xmath .
Using equality ( B.15 ), the map @xmath is an isomorphism. Since, by
definition, the map @xmath is an isomorphism, we conclude that

###### Corollary B.12.

The restriction @xmath is a vector space isomorphism.

#### b.3.3 Killing induced product

Since the Killing form @xmath is an @xmath -invariant product on @xmath
, we can define

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

which descent (see [ 34 ] for properties) to a homogeneous metric on
@xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the canonical projection. An useful property of that
projection is @xmath when @xmath . Using that property, we can write the
product under the more manageable form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for all @xmath , @xmath .

Although equation ( B.14 ) looks like ( B.13 ), we find a major
difference here: the norm of @xmath is not a constant. One should expect
that it was a constant because ( B.13 ) expresses a left translation
while the Killing form is invariant under left translations. But the
metric ( B.17 ) is a composition of the Killing form with a projection.
Let us study this case in details in computing the product of two
vectors of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with @xmath :

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

where the symbol @xmath has to be understood as “not equal in general”
because equality holds of course for certain particular vectors such as
zero.

### b.4 Toolbox for @xmath

#### b.4.1 Iwasawa decomposition

Let @xmath the group of @xmath matrices with unit determinant. The Lie
algebra @xmath is the algebra of matrices with vanishing trace:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

The following elements will be intensively used:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath has been introduced for later convenience. The commutators
are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
                                            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.19a)
              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.19b)
              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.19c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

Notice that the sets @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are basis. A Cartan
involution is given by @xmath , and the corresponding Cartan
decomposition is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Up to some choices, the Iwasawa decomposition of the group @xmath is
given by the exponentiation of @xmath , @xmath and @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.20)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

so that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

A common parametrization of @xmath by @xmath is provided by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

One immediately has the following formula for the left action of @xmath
on itself:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In this setting, the inverse is given by @xmath .

#### b.4.2 Killing form

The Killing form @xmath takes the following values:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
                                            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.23a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.23b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.23c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

Expressed in the basis @xmath , the matrix of the Killing form reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

while, in the basis @xmath , we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

The latter is the reason of the name of the vector @xmath : the sign of
its norm is different, so that @xmath is candidate to be a time-like
direction.

#### b.4.3 Abstract root space setting

Looking on the table ( B.19 ) from an abstract point of view, we see
that @xmath and @xmath are eigenvectors of @xmath with eigenvalues
@xmath and @xmath . So @xmath ; @xmath ; and @xmath . Using a more
abstract notation, the table of @xmath becomes

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.26a)
              @xmath      (B.26b)
              @xmath      (B.26c)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

#### b.4.4 Isomorphism

As pointed out in the chapter II, §6 of [ 35 ] , the map (seen as a
conjugation in @xmath )

  -- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath            (B.27)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --------

with @xmath is an isomorphism between @xmath and @xmath .

### b.5 Root spaces for @xmath

The algebra @xmath is made up from @xmath matrices such that @xmath with
vanishing trace. If we choice @xmath , we find matrices of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is an antisymmetric @xmath matrix and @xmath is any @xmath
matrix. We find the Cartan decomposition

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If one chooses

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

as generator for the abelian subalgebra of @xmath , one finds

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

as eigenvectors for @xmath with eigenvalues @xmath and @xmath . The root
space decomposition commutator table of @xmath is thus given by

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.28a)
              @xmath      (B.28b)
              @xmath      (B.28c)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Notice that the map @xmath , @xmath , @xmath provides an isomorphism
between this table and the one of @xmath , equations ( B.26 ). This fact
assures a Lie algebra isomorphism @xmath . We actually have a stronger
result:

###### Proposition B.13.

The group @xmath is a double-covering of the identity component @xmath .

### b.6 Iwasawa decomposition for @xmath

We saw in the section B.9 that the quotient @xmath has a particular
importance. Hence, we will work out the Iwasawa decompositions of these
groups imposing certain compatibility conditions. We already build the
Cartan involution @xmath in such a way that @xmath .

Now we show that @xmath descent to a Cartan involution on @xmath . It is
clear that the restriction of @xmath is an involutive automorphism of
@xmath . Lemma B.17 assures us that the restriction of the Killing form
of @xmath to @xmath is the Killing form of @xmath , so that the
condition of positivity of @xmath holds on @xmath as well as on @xmath .
Last, @xmath leaves @xmath invariant. Indeed suppose that @xmath . Then
@xmath and @xmath ; since @xmath , we have @xmath .

All that proves that we can use the same Cartan involution on @xmath as
well as on @xmath . Since @xmath , it is clear that

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.29)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

is the Cartan decomposition of @xmath . We can write explicit matrices
as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is skew-symmetric, and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

One remark that there are no two-dimensional subalgebra of @xmath . So
@xmath reduces to the choice of any element @xmath . A positivity notion
is easy to find: the form @xmath such that @xmath is positive while
@xmath is negative. We choose

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The computation of @xmath yields the following :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

Finally, we consider the algebra @xmath .

### b.7 Iwasawa decomposition for @xmath

As seen in the general construction and in previous examples, the
Iwasawa decomposition of a group or an algebra depends on several
choices. We will study two out of them in the case of @xmath and see
that some “compatibility conditions” with the decomposition of @xmath
and the symmetric space structure of @xmath (see section B.9 ) fix most
of choices.

The Lie algebra @xmath is the set

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the diagonal metric @xmath . An element of @xmath can be
written as @xmath with the matrices @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and
@xmath . The conditions in ( B.33 ) give: @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath .
Hence, a general matrix of @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are skew-symmetric.

#### b.7.1 Cartan decomposition

The Cartan decomposition of @xmath associated with the Cartan involution
@xmath is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.35)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Elements of @xmath are represented by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

A common abuse of notation in the text will be to identify the angle
@xmath with the element of @xmath itself. In the same spirit, when we
speak about a matrix of @xmath , we mean a matrix whose upper left
corner is @xmath and the rest is the unit matrix. For example, for
@xmath , the matrix @xmath is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Remark that @xmath , the compact part of @xmath is made up from “true”
rotations while @xmath contains boosts. This remark allows us to guess a
right choice of maximal abelian subalgebra in @xmath . Indeed elements
of @xmath must be boosts and the fact that there are only two time-like
directions restricts @xmath to a two dimensional algebra. Up to
reparametrization, it is thus generated by @xmath and @xmath . Hence the
following choice seems to be logical:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.36)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

#### b.7.2 Maximal abelian subalgebra

The generators of @xmath that we choose are the following linear
combination of @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### b.7.3 Nilpotent part

We search the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath under the form
@xmath with @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath . Remark that, thanks to (
B.35 ), the matrix @xmath is completely determined by @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

The equation to be solved is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

with the notation @xmath .

##### Search for two non zero eigenvalues

By “two non zero eigenvalues”, we mean a @xmath such that @xmath and
@xmath . We immediately find @xmath .

The next step is to determine @xmath by the condition @xmath . We change
the range of the indices. Now, @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath , @xmath and
a few computation give @xmath (with sum over @xmath ). Taking
successively @xmath and taking into account @xmath , we find:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.40a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.40b)
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.40c)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

We can check that the equations obtained by @xmath are exactly the one
that we can find directly using ( B.38 ) and ( B.40 ).

Now, we determine @xmath by the condition @xmath . We know that @xmath
and @xmath are @xmath matrices. Again, we redefine the range of the
indices: @xmath and @xmath . Symmetry properties of @xmath are @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath , so that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Using equation ( B.37 ), a quite tedious (but direct) computation give
the following for @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

which has to be equated to @xmath . We immediately have @xmath . The
others conditions are:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.42a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.42b)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Since we are in the case @xmath , using the fact that @xmath , we easily
find @xmath . Now, we define @xmath by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

Root spaces are (with @xmath ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

##### Search for eigenvalues with one zero

We denote by @xmath the element of @xmath defined by @xmath . Equations
( B.41 ) and ( B.42 ) with for example @xmath and @xmath give @xmath .
Serious computation give:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (B.45a)
     @xmath      (B.45b)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In these expressions, we only wrote the upper left part of the matrices
which are zero everywhere else.

##### Two vanishing eigenvalues

We now search for a matrix @xmath of @xmath such that @xmath for @xmath
. Taking a look at ( B.39 ), we see that @xmath has no more constraints
(apart the usual symmetries). The equation ( B.41 ) gives us @xmath ,
but @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath are free. Therefore we can write:

  -- -- -- --------
           (B.46)
  -- -- -- --------

Remark that @xmath is spanned by matrices of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

so that @xmath . This is a simple consequence of the very definition of
@xmath as maximal abelian subalgebra of @xmath .

##### Choice of positivity

We are now able to write down the component @xmath . We just have to
“select” some @xmath with a notion of positivity. Our choice is:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath , @xmath . A basis of @xmath is given by @xmath , and @xmath
with @xmath .

Let us summarize the result obtained. The Iwasawa decomposition of
@xmath is given by

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.48a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.48b)
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.48c)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath skew-symmetric, and @xmath .

The non-zero commutators in @xmath are :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
                                            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.49a)
              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.49b)
              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.49c)
              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.49d)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

#### b.7.4 Second Iwasawa decomposition for @xmath

We know the @xmath eigenspaces decompositions @xmath with @xmath , and
the Iwasawa decomposition @xmath of @xmath .

For compatibility and simplicity purposes, we want the Iwasawa
decompositions @xmath of @xmath in such a way that @xmath and @xmath .
We denote by @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath the
analytic connected subgroups of @xmath whose Lie algebras are @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath respectively.

For the @xmath -part, we just perform a change of basis

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.50a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.50b)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

in order to have @xmath and @xmath . The involution @xmath has a simpler
expression in this basis. If @xmath , the notation @xmath means @xmath ,
and @xmath denotes the root space associated with the form @xmath .

###### Lemma B.14.

The involutions @xmath and @xmath act on the root spaces by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.51)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

for all @xmath ,

###### Proof.

Let @xmath and @xmath ; by definition: @xmath . We have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We conclude that @xmath . For the second equality, we take @xmath and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

∎

###### Proposition B.15.

The involution @xmath changes the sign of the @xmath -part of the root
spaces:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath denote the coordinates of a root in the basis @xmath of
@xmath .

###### Proof.

Since @xmath is an involutive automorphism, it satisfies @xmath . So
when @xmath , we have @xmath and @xmath .

∎

It is also clear that @xmath implies @xmath . Indeed, @xmath , because
@xmath .

We turn now our attention to the Iwasawa decomposition. As before we are
searching for matrices under the form @xmath with dimensions @xmath .
The condition which determines the root spaces reads

  -- -- -- --------
           (B.52)
  -- -- -- --------

The computations are rather the same as the ones of the first time. The
result is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is skew-symmetric. Notice that all but the @xmath -part of
this space is spanned by @xmath and @xmath , so the @xmath -component of
that matrix is a multiple of @xmath . Other root spaces are given by

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.54a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.54b)
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.54c)
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.54d)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

with ¹ ¹ 1 Let us remember that we are dealing with @xmath and that
@xmath is a quotient of @xmath , so in the case of @xmath the index
@xmath runs from @xmath to @xmath . The first anti de Sitter space which
contains such root spaces is @xmath . More generally, remark that the
table ( B.59 ) of @xmath gives the feeling that if something works with
@xmath , it will work for @xmath . @xmath . For example,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

These are the same spaces as the previous ones. The subtlety is that we
will choice an other notion of positivity, so that the space @xmath will
be different.

Let us recall the aim of our new decomposition: we want to have @xmath .
For this purpose, the equation ( B.32 ) gives us a constraint on the
choice of the positivity notion on @xmath . First we must have @xmath .
The the upper left @xmath corner of @xmath is spanned by @xmath . We
complete our choice of @xmath with @xmath . The underlying notion of
positivity is that the element @xmath is positive in @xmath when @xmath
.

The difference between decomposition and the previous one is the
replacement of @xmath by @xmath . Now

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.58a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.58b)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

with the commutator table

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
                                            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.59a)
              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.59b)
              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.59c)
              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.59d)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

It is important to note that @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . The following
change of basis in @xmath reveals to be useful in some circumstances:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
                                            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.60a)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

which leads to the table

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
                                            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.61a)
              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.61b)
              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.61c)
              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.61d)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

### b.8 Group realization of low dimensional anti de Sitter spaces

#### b.8.1 Two dimensional anti de Sitter

Using notations and conventions of section B.4 , the set @xmath is a
subset of @xmath made of elements of norm @xmath . One can show by brute
force computation or using the commutation relations that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which is a, following the Killing form ( B.25 ), general element of norm
@xmath in @xmath . Thus as sets, @xmath is @xmath . Since @xmath is the
stabilizer of @xmath for the adjoint action of @xmath on @xmath and
@xmath , we also have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

That provides isomorphisms

  -- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath            (B.62)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --------

or

  -- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath            (B.63)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --------

where @xmath is the usual cylinder in @xmath .

#### b.8.2 Three dimensional anti de Sitter

The space @xmath is the hyperboloid

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

embedded in @xmath . There exists a bijection between @xmath and the two
by two real matrices given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

As far as norm is concerned, we have @xmath . Among these matrices, the
ones of @xmath are given by the condition @xmath , which is precisely
the equation of the hyperboloid in @xmath . That shows that @xmath .

### b.9 Symmetric space structure on anti de Sitter

The @xmath -dimensional anti de Sitter space @xmath can be described as
set of points @xmath such that @xmath . The next few pages are devoted
to describe the homogeneous and symmetric space structures on @xmath
induced by the transitive an isometric action of @xmath . We suppose
that the groups @xmath and @xmath are parametrized in such a way that
the second, seen as subgroup of the first one, leaves unchanged the
vector @xmath . In this case, proposition 4.3 of chapter II in [ 18 ]
provides the homogeneous space isomorphism

  -- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath            (B.65)
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --------

where the dot denotes the usual “matrix times vector” action of the
representative @xmath in the defining representation of @xmath on @xmath
. As far as notations are concerned, the classes are taken from the
right: @xmath ; in particular the class of the identity @xmath is
denoted by @xmath ; the groups @xmath and @xmath are denoted by @xmath
and @xmath respectively and their Lie algebras by @xmath and @xmath .
Following proposition B.3 , we can in fact only consider the identity
components of @xmath and @xmath .

###### Proposition B.16.

The homogeneous space @xmath is reductive.

The proof relies on the following lemma and the fact that @xmath is
semisimple.

###### Lemma B.17.

If @xmath is a semisimple Lie group and @xmath a semisimple subgroup of
@xmath , the restrictions on @xmath of the Killing form of @xmath is
nondegenerate.

###### Proof of proposition b.16.

From the Killing form of @xmath , one defines

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Let @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . From @xmath -invariance of the Killing
form, we have @xmath . Hence @xmath and the claim is proved.

∎

Matrices of @xmath are @xmath matrices while the @xmath -dimensional
anti de Sitter space is a quotient of @xmath . In order to avoid
confusions, we will reserve the letter @xmath to the study of the group
@xmath and the letter @xmath will denote the dimension of the anti de
Sitter space which will thus be @xmath .

Let us provide a matrix representation now. The matrices of @xmath have
to be seen as matrices of @xmath with the condition @xmath for the
“metric” @xmath . Hence,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath is skew-symmetric. Comparing this with the
general form ( B.34 ) of a matrix of @xmath matrix, one immediately
finds that, with the choice

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

the decomposition @xmath is reductive:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.68)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

and @xmath . In the sequel, we will use the basis of @xmath defined by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.69)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

We define the involutive automorphism @xmath . The vector space @xmath
can be identified with the tangent space @xmath , and that
identification can be extended by defining @xmath . In this case @xmath
is a vector space isomorphism. A homogeneous metric on @xmath is defined
as in subsection B.3.3 .

Cartan decomposition of @xmath are of crucial importance in chapter 1 ,
so that we want to use a Cartan involution @xmath such that @xmath (see
[ 32 ] page 153, theorem 2.1). One can show that @xmath has that
property. The corresponding Cartan decomposition is described in
appendix B.7.1 .

As a consequence of relations ( B.68 ),

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.70)
  -- -------- -- --------

because, if @xmath , @xmath , so @xmath and @xmath .

### b.10 Iwasawa decomposition for @xmath

Matrices of @xmath are acting on @xmath as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

if @xmath . Our aim is to embed @xmath in @xmath (see sections B.11 and
2.3 ), so that we want a four dimensional realization of @xmath . It is
easy to rewrite the previous action under the form of @xmath acting of
the vertical four component vector @xmath . The result is that a general
matrix of @xmath reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.71)
  -- -------- -- --------

The boxes are drawn for visual convenience. Using the Cartan involution
@xmath , we find the following Cartan decomposition:

  -- -- -- --------
           (B.72)
  -- -- -- --------

We have @xmath and @xmath . A maximal abelian subalgebra of @xmath is
the one dimensional algebra generated by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The corresponding root spaces are

-   @xmath :

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

-   @xmath :

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

-   @xmath

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

It is natural to choice @xmath as positive root space system. In this
case, @xmath , @xmath and the table of @xmath is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.73)
              @xmath                        (B.74)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

### b.11 Symplectic group

#### b.11.1 Iwasawa decomposition

A simple computation shows that @xmath matrices subject to @xmath are
given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is any @xmath matrix while @xmath and @xmath are symmetric
matrices. Looking at general form ( B.71 ), we see that the operation to
invert the two last column and then to invert the two last lines
provides a homomorphism @xmath . The aim is now to build an Iwasawa
decomposition of @xmath which “contains” the one of @xmath .

Using the Cartan involution @xmath , we find the Cartan decomposition

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.75)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are any symmetric matrices while @xmath is a
skew-symmetric one. We have @xmath and @xmath . It turns out that @xmath
and @xmath . A maximal abelian subalgebra of @xmath is spanned by the
matrices @xmath and @xmath listed below and the corresponding root
spaces are:

-   @xmath :

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

-   @xmath :

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

-   @xmath :

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

-   @xmath :

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

-   @xmath :

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

-   @xmath :

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

-   @xmath

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

-   @xmath :

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

-   @xmath :

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

It is important to notice how do the root spaces of @xmath embed:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.76)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.77)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.78)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

So @xmath must at least contain the elements @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
. We complete the notion of positivity by @xmath . The Iwasawa algebra
reads

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

with

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --

where @xmath and @xmath . Generators of @xmath by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --

Notice that @xmath for @xmath , @xmath , @xmath .

#### b.11.2 Isomorphism

The following provides an isomorphism @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath                     
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --

where the @xmath ’s are the generators of the @xmath part of @xmath
satisfying the relations @xmath . It is now easy to check that the image
of the embedding @xmath is exactly @xmath , so that

  -- -- -- --------
           (B.79)
  -- -- -- --------

is an isomorphism which realises @xmath as subalgebra of @xmath . This
circumstance will be useful in defining a spin structure on @xmath .

One can prove that the kernel of the adjoint representation of @xmath on
its Lie algebra is @xmath , in other words, @xmath if and only if @xmath
. We define a bijective map @xmath by the requirement that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.80)
  -- -------- -- --------

for every @xmath . The following is true for all @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

the map @xmath is therefore a homomorphism. If an element @xmath reads
@xmath in the Iwasawa decomposition, the property @xmath holds for the
element @xmath of @xmath . This shows that @xmath is surjective.

#### b.11.3 Reductive structure on the symplectic group

A lot of structure of @xmath , such as the reductive homogeneous space
decomposition as @xmath , can be immediately transported from @xmath to
@xmath . Indeed, let @xmath and @xmath . We have the direct sum
decomposition

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Let @xmath , then @xmath belongs to @xmath which only contains @xmath .
The fact that @xmath is an isomorphism yields that @xmath . Since @xmath
preserves linear independence, a simple dimension counting shows that
the sum actually spans the whole space.

Putting @xmath in the definition ( B.80 ) of @xmath , we find

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Considering a path @xmath with @xmath , we differentiate this expression
with respect to @xmath at @xmath we find

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

but @xmath because @xmath is linear, hence @xmath for all @xmath and
@xmath . We deduce that @xmath . We define

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

We can check that @xmath and @xmath . Then it is clear that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath

using the corresponding vanishing commutator in @xmath . We denote
@xmath and the fact that @xmath shows that @xmath is a basis of @xmath .
So we consider the basis @xmath of @xmath and the corresponding
left-invariant vector fields @xmath .

### b.12 Some symplectic and Poisson geometry

#### b.12.1 Symplectic manifold

A symplectic structure on a vector space @xmath is a skew-symmetric,
nondegenerate bilinear @xmath -form @xmath . We define the symplectic
group @xmath \nomenclature @xmath Symplectic group as the group of
linear operators @xmath such that @xmath for every @xmath , @xmath . It
is easy to see that elements of @xmath satisfy

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.81)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Lie algebra of @xmath is denoted by @xmath \nomenclature @xmath
Symplectic algebra. Taking the derivative of equation ( B.81 ) with
respect to @xmath , one finds the following condition for @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.82)
  -- -------- -- --------

A symplectic manifold is the data of a smooth manifold @xmath and a
symplectic structure @xmath on each tangent space @xmath . The map
@xmath is required to be a smooth section of the @xmath -tensor bundle.

###### Definition B.18.

A symplectic Lie algebra is a Lie algebra @xmath endowed with a
symplectic structure @xmath such that @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.83)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### b.12.2 Poisson manifold

Let @xmath be a smooth manifold. A Poisson bracket , or a Poisson
structure on @xmath is a map @xmath such that

1.  @xmath is a Lie algebra,

2.  for each @xmath , the map @xmath is a derivation of the algebra
    @xmath :

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

#### b.12.3 Hamiltonian action

Let @xmath and @xmath be symplectic manifolds. A symplectomorphism from
@xmath to @xmath is a diffeomorphism @xmath such that @xmath .

For any function @xmath , we define the Hamiltonian field @xmath
associated with @xmath by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.84)
  -- -------- -- --------

Existence is assured because @xmath is nondegenerate. A symplectic
structure induces a Poisson bracket by defining

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.85)
  -- -------- -- --------

In local coordinates, one can write @xmath and @xmath , where @xmath is
the inverse matrix of @xmath . The Poisson tensor defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.86)
  -- -------- -- --------

is nothing else than @xmath .

###### Theorem B.19.

If @xmath is a diffeomorphism between two Poisson manifolds @xmath and
@xmath , then the following are equivalent:

1.  @xmath ,

2.  @xmath ,

3.  @xmath ,

If moreover the Poisson structures @xmath and @xmath come from
symplectic forms @xmath and @xmath ,

1.  @xmath .

Now, we consider a symplectic action @xmath of a Lie group @xmath on
@xmath (i.e. @xmath is a symplectic transformation of @xmath for each
@xmath ). The action is Hamiltonian if, for every @xmath , there exists
a map @xmath such that

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.87a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.87b)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

###### Definition B.20.

The map @xmath which satisfies ( B.87 ) is the dual momentum map while
the momentum map is @xmath defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.88)
  -- -------- -- --------

for all @xmath .

#### b.12.4 Coadjoint orbits

Let @xmath be a Lie group and @xmath its Lie algebra. We know that
@xmath acts on the dual @xmath by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.89)
  -- -------- -- --------

for @xmath and @xmath . The second equality defines the coadjoint action
@xmath . In other words, for all @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In this context, the notion of fundamental fields is given bu @xmath .
Let @xmath , the orbit of @xmath in @xmath . It can be shown that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.90)
  -- -------- -- --------

defines a symplectic form on @xmath \nomenclature @xmath Coadjoint orbit
of @xmath , the coadjoint orbit of @xmath .

###### Proposition B.21.

The coadjoint action is Hamiltonian.

#### b.12.5 Central extension

Let @xmath be a Lie algebra. A Chevalley coboundary is a @xmath -form
which reads @xmath for a certain @xmath with @xmath defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.91)
  -- -------- -- --------

Let @xmath be a @xmath -cocycle. If it is not a coboundary, we add an
element @xmath in @xmath and we consider @xmath with the Lie algebra
structure

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.92)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is the central extension of @xmath with respect to the @xmath
-cocycle @xmath . The terminology comes from the fact that the extension
@xmath belongs to the center of @xmath . The point is that @xmath is a
coboundary in @xmath because

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.93)
  -- -------- -- --------

so that @xmath .

Now we suppose that the group @xmath acts on a manifold @xmath . We
define the action of the extended group @xmath by saying that the “new”
part does not act: @xmath . Fundamental fields remains unchanged:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.94)
  -- -------- -- --------

If the action of @xmath on @xmath is weakly Hamiltonian, we have
functions @xmath such that @xmath . These functions fulfil @xmath . We
define

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.95)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Proposition B.22.

The action of @xmath is (strongly) Hamiltonian for these functions.

###### Proof.

From equation ( B.94 ), we have @xmath hence

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.96)
  -- -------- -- --------

for certain constants @xmath which satisfy the property @xmath .
Therefore

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.97)
  -- -------- -- --------

∎

The sense of the whole construction is the following. When the action
@xmath is weakly Hamiltonian on @xmath , we have functions @xmath which
define @xmath by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In this case, the corresponding group extension has a strongly
Hamiltonian action with momentum maps given by ( B.95 ).

## Conclusion

In a first time we defined a black hole in anti de Sitter space. This
construction is not related to any metric divergence but is a
dimensional generalization of a causal black hole whose singularity is
dictated by causal issues. The originality of our approach lies in the
fact that our method uses essentially group theoretical and symmetric
spaces techniques. That result should be generalisable to any semisimple
symmetric space.

Then we proved that the physical domain of the black hole (the non
singular part) is equivalent to a group in the sense that there exists a
group which acts freely and transitively by diffeomorphisms. So we
identify the group with the manifold and it is easy to prove that the
latter group is a split extension of an Heisenberg group which happens
to be quantizable by a twisted pull-back of a previously known
quantization of @xmath .

We also proved two somewhat out of subject small results. The first one
is the fact that a deformation of the half-plane by Unterberger can be
transported to a deformation of the Iwasawa subgroup of @xmath which can
in turn deform (by the group action method) the dual of its Lie algebra.
We showed however that that deformation is not universal; indeed we
pointed out two different actions of the Iwasawa subgroup of @xmath on
@xmath for which the deformation by group action method reveals to be
unable to even multiply two compactly supported functions. An
interesting question is to know the precise point in the construction of
Unterberger which makes his product non universal.

The second small result is a proof of concept for quantization of the
Iwasawa subgroup of @xmath by the method of the extension lemma. We
wrote @xmath as a symplectic split extension of @xmath by @xmath . The
extension lemma then provided a kernel on @xmath because kernels were
known on @xmath and @xmath . Is that quantization equivalent in some
sense to the one that we performed in the main line of the black hole
deformation ? That question still has to be solved.

As a final remark, I want to point out that the major challenge of this
century is not quantization, but global warming.
