strong negative type. That is, we prove that the distance covariance
measure can directly determine whether random elements with values in
two separable Hilbert spaces are independent or not.
The definition of metric spaces of strong negative type is given in
terms of properties of @xmath , so before we continue we will present a
lemma, connecting the previously analysed class of negative type metric
spaces, with the mapping @xmath .
