  In this thesis we contribute to the understanding of the pivotal role
  of the temporal dimension in networked social systems, previously
  neglected and now uncovered by the data revolution recently blossomed
  in this field. To this aim, we first introduce the time-varying
  networks formalism and analyze some empirical data of social dynamics,
  extensively used in the rest of the thesis. We discuss the structural
  and temporal properties of the human contact networks, such as
  heterogeneity and burstiness of social interactions, and we present a
  simple model, rooted on social attractiveness, able to reproduce them.
  We then explore the behavior of dynamical processes running on top of
  temporal networks, constituted by empirical face-to-face interactions,
  addressing in detail the fundamental cases of random walks and
  epidemic spreading. We also develop an analytic approach able to
  compute the structural and percolation properties of activity driven
  model, aimed to describe a wide class of social interactions, driven
  by the activity of the individuals involved. Our contribution in the
  rapidly evolving framework of social time-varying networks opens
  interesting perspectives for future work, such as the study of the
  impact of the temporal dimension on multi-layered systems.
