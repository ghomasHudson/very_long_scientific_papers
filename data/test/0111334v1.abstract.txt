expected contribution of the infinitely new degrees of freedom within
the known experimental and observational data, it is necessary to bounds
on the parameters of the models with extra dimensions, both compact or
non, mainly lower bounds on the fundamental scale of gravity whether
this scale is set by the size of the compact dimensions, the
characteristic scale which enters in the localization of matter
transverse a non-compact space, or other relevant model dependent
scales. In any case, the larger the number of the extra dimensions is
the looser the bounds become.

In the following we review some of the rather established bounds imposed
on models with large extra dimensions, ³⁵ ³⁵ 35 Discussion about
searches for extra dimensions in future colliders can be found in [ 18 ]
and [ 165 , 166 , 167 ] . with more emphasis on constraints arising from
compatibility with Cosmological observations. After having done so, we
go on to present examples where the standard big bang Cosmology can be
recovered in Kaluza-Klein compactification schemes and in
Randall-Sundrum type scenarios. Then we move on to discuss briefly the
issue of stabilizing the scale of compactification, proton stability in
theories with extra dimensions, and finally baryogenesis with low scale
gravity. We conclude this chapter by presenting a model for baryogenesis
in 5 dimensions.
