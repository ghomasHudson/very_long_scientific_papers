This thesis is devoted to asymptotic norm estimates for oscillatory
integral operators acting on the @xmath space of functions of one real
variable. The operators in question have compact support and an
oscillatory kernel of the form @xmath , where @xmath is a smooth real
phase function, and @xmath is a large real number.

I study how the norm of the operator decays as @xmath goes to infinity,
and how the rate of this decay can be determined from the properties of
the phase function @xmath .

For @xmath phase functions I prove results formulated in terms of the
Newton polygon of @xmath , improving previously known estimates. My
estimates are best possible or differ from the best possible ones by at
most a power of @xmath .

I use two different methods. The first method is based on the geometric
analysis of the zero set of the Hessian @xmath using the Puiseux
decompositions. The second method is based on a stopping time argument.
