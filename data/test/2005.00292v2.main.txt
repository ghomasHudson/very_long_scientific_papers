#### 5.3.5 Method with 5D Fields as Distributions

When a brane is away from a boundary as the fixed point of @xmath on
@xmath , 5D fields can be discontinuous across the brane. It is then
practical to associate regular distributions to the 5D fields in order
to have 5D Euler-Lagrange equations with the Yukawa couplings in factor
of a Dirac distribution. This method is interesting only for the 5D
treatment of brane localized Yukawa couplings which involves Dirac
distributions (the free case and the 4D method are trivial with
distributions since the KK wave functions are continuous).

Once the action is defined with a Lagrangian involving distributions,
one can use Hamilton’s principle within distribution theory. The
variations of the fields are test functions whose supports are included
in the compact space. A brane away from the boundaries does not give a
boundary term in the action but generates a term proportional to a Dirac
distribution in the 5D Euler-Lagrange equations. On the covering space
@xmath , there is no boundary terms since, after the integration by
parts,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.124)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the regular distribution associated to the function
@xmath discontinuous at @xmath . To solve the 5D Euler-Lagrange
equations, it is convenient to solve them first in the regions outside
the brane and then to integrate the equations over the extra dimension
in a small neighborhood of the brane to get the junction conditions on
the brane. We recover the same boundary conditions as with the method
with functions.

##### 5.3.6 An alternative Way to Recover the Interval

In this subsection, we present an alternative treatment of the model of
Subsection 5.3 with an extra dimension compactified on the orbifold
@xmath , with the 5D fields as functions (but one can do it also with
distributions). We start with the action defined on the covering space
@xmath and reduce it to an action on the interval @xmath with the @xmath
symmetry at the level of the action. Of course, this is equivalent to
the previous methods where we recover the interval solutions by applying
the @xmath symmetry at the level of the KK wave functions.

The action is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.125)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath , @xmath and @xmath defined as the actions of the kinetic
terms, the brane localized Yukawa interactions and the BBTs respectively
( @xmath ):

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.126)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath defined in Eq. ( 4.3 ) where the left-hand partial
derivatives @xmath are defined at @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.127)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath defined in Eq. ( 5.127 ), and

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.128)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

When calculating the mass spectrum of the KK fermions, we restrict our
attention to the VEV @xmath of @xmath ( 4.6 ). Hence, we decompose the
Yukawa interactions into @xmath and the action involving only the
fermions becomes:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.129)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (5.130)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with the compact notations @xmath , @xmath , and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (5.131)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We begin by cutting the integral over @xmath of the kinetic terms (
5.129 ) at the brane-Higgs position:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (5.132)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

where the right-hand (left-hand) partial derivatives @xmath of the 5D
fields are defined at @xmath ( @xmath ). We have thus the right-hand
(left-hand) continuity of the 5D fields at @xmath ( @xmath ).

We choose the transformation laws for the fermionic fields @xmath and
@xmath under @xmath as:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.133)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Considering the Lagrangian symmetry @xmath , and performing a change of
variable in the kinetic terms ( 5.132 ):

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
                          (5.134)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Then we separate the brane localized mass terms into two identical parts
by the left-hand continuity of the 5D fields at @xmath and we use the
symmetry under @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
                          
                          (5.135)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

We can also use the transformation laws ( 5.133 ) in the BBTs ( 5.128 ):

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
                          
              @xmath      (5.136)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

We rewrite @xmath as

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.137)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Using ( 5.134 ), ( 5.135 ), ( 5.136 ) into ( 5.137 ), we find the
identity:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.138)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Finally, we separate the action @xmath ( 5.129 ) into 2 identical parts:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.139)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We can thus treat @xmath as the basic building block and go back to the
interval scenario @xmath in Subsection 4.6.3 . If we search for the
profiles in @xmath , we just need to use the transformation laws ( 5.133
) for fermionic fields @xmath and @xmath .

#### 5.4 Higgs Field Localized at a Fixed Point of the Orbifold @xmath

As we explained in Subsection 2.2.1 (we keep the same definitions and
notations), a compactification on @xmath allows the possibility of a
Scherk-Schwarz twist. If one mods out @xmath by a @xmath symmetry with
respect to @xmath , the Scherk-Schwarz twist is constrained. One can
combine it with the @xmath symmetry in order to define a new reflection
symmetry @xmath with respect to @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.140)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The two fixed points of the orbifold @xmath are still @xmath and @xmath
, and the fundamental domain is the interval @xmath . It is convenient
to define the field theory on an extended circle of circumference @xmath
with the coordinate @xmath (see Fig. 5.2 ).

The model has the same field content as in Subsection 4.2 . Again, we
treat the fields as distributions, which act on test functions whose
supports are included into the compactified geometry. We will give only
the method with functions including the brane localized interaction, and
we will motivate the BBTs by defining the fields as distributions in the
Lagrangians.

###### Fields as Distributions

The bulk action at the level of distributions is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (5.141)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We choose the transformation laws for the fermionic fields @xmath and
@xmath under @xmath as in Eq. ( 5.97 ) and under @xmath as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.142)
  -- -------- -- ---------

under which the action @xmath ( 5.96 ) is invariant (the parities even
and odd are considered with respect to the point @xmath ). The choice of
the signs in front of @xmath in Eqs. ( 5.97 ) and ( 5.142 ) is free.
They determine if the 5D field has a zero mode and its chirality. Here,
we require that @xmath has a left/right-handed zero mode respectively in
order to recover the SM at low energy.

On each brane at @xmath , there is one copy of the same Higgs field. The
action for the brane localized Higgs fields @xmath (real scalar fields
in this toy model) is thus

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (5.143)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the action of a Dirac distribution centered at @xmath on a test
function @xmath is defined as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.144)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The brane localized Yukawa interactions are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (5.145)
  -- -------- -- ---------

By keeping only the Higgs VEV (Eq. ( 4.6 )), we have the brane localized
mass terms:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (5.146)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Again, we need @xmath in order to give a mass to the zero modes of
@xmath and @xmath so these 5D fields have to be continuous at @xmath .
However, the @xmath -terms are not required by the decoupling argument.
If the odd fields @xmath and @xmath are continuous, they have to vanish
on the branes so the @xmath -terms vanish. If the odd fields are
discontinuous at the fixed points, their product is continuous so we
keep the @xmath -terms.

The weak partial derivatives give

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.147)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

for the even fields,

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (5.148)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

for the odd field @xmath , and

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (5.149)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

for the odd field @xmath . After that, we can rewrite the action @xmath
( 5.141 ) as

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (5.150)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

As in the case of the orbifold @xmath in Section 5.3 , BBTs appears on
both sides of the branes.

###### Mass Spectrum

In order to obtain the KK mass spectrum and the wave functions, we use
the same method as in Subsection 5.3.4 . We apply Hamilton’s principle
to the action @xmath Eqs. ( 5.150 ) and ( 5.146 ). From the vanishing of
the variation of the action in the bulk, we get the Euler-Lagrange
equations ( 4.15 ) extended on @xmath . The variation of the action on
the branes gives the natural boundary conditions ( 5.121 ). We give the
different steps for the variations of the actions at the two equivalent
branes at @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (5.151)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

where we used the @xmath symmetry (Eq. ( 5.142 )) to go from the first
line to the second one and the @xmath symmetry (Eq. ( 5.97 )) to go from
the second line to the second one. By using the same method for each
field variation, we get the same boundary conditions as for the orbifold
@xmath : Eq. ( 5.121 ). As for the orbifold @xmath , the fields @xmath
and @xmath are discontinuous across the branes where the Higgs field is
localized and @xmath . The free case is obtained by taking @xmath and we
get that every field is continuous at the fixed points.

We perform a mixed KK decomposition,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.152)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the KK modes satisfy the Dirac-Weyl equations ( 4.59 ) and the KK
wave functions are orthonormalized so that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.153)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where we normalize on the whole extended circle. The discussion is the
same as in Section 4.6 , below Eq. ( 4.100 ), with the replacements
Eq. ( 4.58 ) @xmath Eq. ( 5.152 ), Eq. ( 4.61 ) @xmath Eq. ( 5.153 ) and
@xmath : we obtain the KK wave function solutions ( 4.90 ) on @xmath and
the mass spectrum ( 4.109 ) (with @xmath and @xmath ). We obtain the
solutions on the whole extended circle by using the symmetries @xmath
and @xmath . The mass spectrum is the same as in the case of the
compactification on the orbifold @xmath . There is again this difference
of a factor 2 with the mass spectrum of the compactification on the
interval @xmath (see below Eq. ( 5.123 ) for a discussion). We conclude
that all these models are dual.

###### Summary and Conclusion

In this section, we have reformulated our model of Chapter 4 with the
orbifold @xmath . The BBTs are generated in distribution theory by the
odd fields which are in general discontinuous at the fixed points, in
contrast to the interval compactification in Chapter 4 where we need to
add the BBTs by hand. We get the mass spectrum with an orbifold geometry
from the one with an interval by the replacement @xmath .

#### 5.5 Higgs Field Localized on a Brane Away from a Boundary of an
Interval

##### 5.5.1 5D Method with Fields as Distributions

In this section, we consider the same model as in Section 4.2 but the
Higgs boson is now localized on a new 3-brane at @xmath , away from but
parallel to a boundary. The reader can follow Section 4.2 for the field
content of the model; we keep the same notations. However, one has to
substitute @xmath in Subsections 4.2.3 and 4.2.4 .

Following Appendix B.2 , it is important to allow for the possibility
that some fields are discontinuous across the brane at @xmath . We
choose to treat the fields as distributions (see Appendix B.2 ) which
act on test functions whose supports are part of the compactified
geometry. In order to define the partial derivatives @xmath and @xmath
in the kinetic term, it is useful to define the Lagrangians using
distribution theory. Indeed, one can associate regular distributions
@xmath and @xmath to the fields @xmath and @xmath respectively, and thus
put a tilde on every field @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and every
Lagrangian of Section 4.2 , which have to be considered as
distributions. The action of the system is then the action of Lagrangian
on the test function @xmath . The product of two distributions in the
Lagrangian is defined as in Appendix A of Ref. [ 383 ] . The kinetic
term of @xmath ( 4.3 ) involves the terms @xmath and @xmath with @xmath
or @xmath . They are well defined if at least @xmath or @xmath is
continuous at @xmath since the weak derivative of a discontinuous
function involves a Dirac distribution. We want that the Higgs VEV gives
a mass to the zero modes of @xmath and @xmath in order to recover the SM
in the decoupling limit, so the terms involving @xmath in @xmath ( 4.7 )
have to be well defined. As they are proportional to @xmath and involve
the fields @xmath and @xmath , these two fields have to be continuous at
@xmath . As for the terms involving @xmath , which are also proportional
to @xmath , they involve the fields @xmath and @xmath , and their
presence is not necessary for recovering the SM in the decoupling limit.
@xmath and/or @xmath can be discontinuous at @xmath . The product of two
discontinuous function can be continuous but if it is not, the terms
proportional to @xmath are not defined, thus one has to take @xmath .
With these constraints, we have the weak partial derivatives:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.154)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

where the @xmath ’s are the regular distributions associated to the
functions @xmath . One can use Eq. ( 5.154 ) to go from a distributional
to a functional treatment of the Lagrangians and fields where BBTs
appear from the weak partial derivative of the discontinuous fields. We
can thus continue to use the Lagrangians of Section 4.2 with fields as
functions if one adds to @xmath ( 4.12 ) the action

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.155)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We apply Hamilton’s principle to the action @xmath with arbitrary field
variations in the bulk and at the boundaries. For the fields continuous
(discontinuous) across the brane at @xmath , the variations are
continuous (discontinuous) and arbitrary at @xmath . We get

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
                          
              @xmath      (5.156)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (5.157)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (5.158)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
                          
              @xmath      (5.159)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

with the notation @xmath . We obtain the Euler-Lagrange equations ( 4.15
) in the bulk, and the following conditions at the branes at @xmath
respectively:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.160)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.161)
  -- -------- -- ---------

If @xmath and @xmath are continuous at @xmath , with non-vanishing
@xmath and @xmath in general (and thus @xmath and @xmath are
non-vanishing too), we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.162)
  -- -------- -- ---------

A Dirichlet condition at @xmath for both chirality implies in general
vanishing KK wave functions and 5D fields everywhere in the extra
dimension. In order to have a physically interesting scenario, we need
to relax the continuity condition for @xmath and @xmath across the brane
at @xmath : @xmath so @xmath and the third line of Eq. ( 5.161 ) is
satisfied whatever are the values of @xmath and @xmath .

As the fields @xmath and @xmath mix due to the brane localized mass term
involving @xmath , we expand the 5D fields into a mixed KK
decomposition:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.163)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The 4D fields @xmath ( @xmath ) satisfy the Dirac-Weyl equations ( 4.59
). The mass spectrum @xmath includes the contributions whose origin is
the Yukawa couplings ( 4.8 ). The wave functions @xmath ( @xmath or
@xmath ) are orthonormalized with the conditions:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.164)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The mixed KK decompositions ( 5.163 ) are inserted into the
Euler-Lagrange equations ( 4.15 ), and into the conditions at the branes
( 5.160 ) and ( 5.161 ). We get the equations for the KK wave functions
( 4.86 ), the boundary conditions:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.165)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and the junction conditions:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.166)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We solve the equations for the KK wave functions ( 4.86 ) in the two
different regions: @xmath and @xmath with the boundary conditions (
5.165 ). We obtain:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.167)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.168)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath , @xmath . The fields @xmath and @xmath are continuous at
@xmath so the wave functions @xmath and @xmath are also continuous
across this brane, and we get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.169)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The junction conditions ( 5.166 ) with the wave functions ( 5.167 ) and
( 5.168 ) give

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.170)
  -- -------- -- ---------

thus we have the equation for the mass spectrum

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.171)
  -- -------- -- ---------

equivalent to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.172)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and we have @xmath . The KK wave functions are orthonormalized by Eq. (
5.164 ), such that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.173)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In a similar way as below Eq. ( 4.107 ), one can show that the phases of
@xmath and @xmath , and the sign of @xmath are not physical, so one can
take @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . Therefore, the two mass spectra of
Eq. ( 5.172 ) are equivalent and correspond to the same KK modes since
one can go frome the first to the second by the transformation @xmath .

The Yukawa couplings between the modes @xmath and @xmath follow from
inserting the KK decompositions ( 5.163 ) in Eq. ( 4.9 ):

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.174)
  -- -------- -- ---------

##### 5.5.2 Conclusion

In this section, we have illustrated the differences between a Higgs
field localized on a brane away from a boundary and on a brane at a
boundary. If the brane is at a boundary, the BBTs are explicitely
introduced in the action from the beginning and all fermion fields are
continuous along the extra dimension. If the brane is away from a
boundary, the brane localized terms imply a jump at the brane position
for one of the two chiralities of the 5D fermion field. The distribution
theory is very convenient in this case and the BBTs are implicitely
generated on both sides of the brane by the weak partial derivative
along the extra dimension of the discontinuous fields.

### Chapter 6 Large Star/Rose Extra Dimension with Small Leaves/Petals

This chapter is an adaptation of Ref. [ 2 ] written under the
supervision of Ulrich Ellwanger.

#### 6.1 Introduction

The large gauge hierarchy between the 4D Planck scale,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the 4D gravitational Newton constant, and the measured
Higgs boson mass @xmath , is one of the internal puzzles of the Standard
Model (SM) of particle physics [ 3 ] when coupled to gravity. If the
Higgs boson is described by an elementary scalar field which is not
protected by a symmetry, the radiative corrections to @xmath are
quadratically sensitive to mass scales of new degrees of freedom. Such
degrees of freedom are expected at least at scales where gravitational
self interactions become strong, which is the 4D Planck scale @xmath in
the usual setup. Then the measured @xmath implies an incredible fine
tuning between the Higgs boson bare mass and the radiative corrections:
this is the naturalness problem of the Higgs boson mass due to the large
hierarchy between the 4D Planck scale @xmath and the ElectroWeak (EW)
scale (usually called the gauge hierarchy problem) [ 17 , 18 , 19 ] . A
possibility to solve this issue is to embed the SM into a theory where
the true Planck scale, i.e. the scale where gravitational self
interactions become strong and new degrees of freedom are expected, is
in the @xmath TeV range. However, this does not solve the question how a
UltraViolet (UV) completion of quantum gravity is achieved.

In 1998, N. Arkani-Hamed, S. Dimopoulos and G.R. Dvali (ADD) proposed in
Ref. [ 34 ] to compactify @xmath flat spacelike extra dimensions on a
@xmath -dimensional compact space @xmath of volume @xmath with a
factorizable spacetime geometry @xmath , where @xmath is the 4D
Minkowski spacetime. The 4D Planck scale @xmath is just an effective
scale given by the relation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

involving the @xmath D Planck scale

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the @xmath D gravitational Newton constant. @xmath is
the real scale at which gravity becomes strongly coupled, so it is the
true cut-off of the QFT ¹ ¹ 1 To be more precise, if the UV completion
is perturbative, the UV gravitational degrees of freedom appear at a
scale @xmath . The cut-off of the EFT is @xmath and not @xmath . For
example, in perturbative string theory, the string scale is lower than
the higher-dimensional Planck scale. To simplify the discussion, we
ignore this possibility here. , and this model solves the gauge
hierarchy problem if @xmath TeV with a large compactified volume @xmath
. In ADD models, the SM fields must be localized on a 3-brane, in
contrast to gravity which is a property of @xmath spacetime in general
relativity. At large distances between two test masses on the 3-brane,
gravity appears as a feebly coupled theory, because gravitational fluxes
spread into the large volume @xmath of the bulk. Quickly [ 36 ] , it was
realized that the Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes of fields propagating into
this large volume @xmath have couplings to the SM fields suppressed by
@xmath . One can thus build natural models of feebly interacting
particles, i.e. particles which have a tiny coupling constant with the
SM, like right-handed neutrinos [ 37 , 38 , 39 ] , axions [ 384 , 385 ]
, dark photons [ 36 ] , etc. In Ref. [ 36 ] , ADD proposed a simple
toroidal compactification @xmath , where @xmath is the circle of radius
@xmath , and @xmath . The bulk fields, like the graviton, generate a
tower of KK modes with a uniform mass gap of @xmath . For a benchmark
value @xmath TeV, the @xmath D Planck length is @xmath , and one gets
Tab. 6.1 and Fig. 6.1 from Eq. ( 6.2 ).

Motivated by UV completions in superstring/M-theory [ 35 , 188 ]
requiring 10/11 spacetime dimensions, most of the efforts concentrated
on @xmath . The compactification radius @xmath must be stabilized at a
large value compared to @xmath , which reintroduces a geometrical
hierarchy [ 36 ] with a low KK mass gap: too light KK-gravitons are
constrained by astrophysics, cosmology and collider physics ² ² 2 For a
review of the constraints on the simplest ADD model with toroidal
compactification, c.f. Ref. [ 386 ] . . When one probes gravitational
Newton’s law at large [small] distances with respect to @xmath , gravity
appears 4D [ @xmath D]. The case @xmath is excluded because it leads to
a modification of 4D gravitational Newton’s law at the scale of the
solar system. ADD’s proposal is thus often associated with the Large
Extra Dimensions (LEDs) paradigm, and is just a reformulation of the
gauge hierarchy problem.

In the literature, there are interesting propositions to stabilize such
large compactification radii [ 237 , 238 , 239 , 240 , 241 , 242 , 243 ]
. To circumvent this geometrical hierarchy problem, a solution can be to
abandon the framework of UV completions by superstring/M-theory, and to
increase the number of extra dimensions. This possibility was mentioned
first in Ref. [ 36 ] . Fig. 6.1 shows that, for sufficiently large
@xmath , the remaining hierarchy disappears: @xmath . A possible trail
to UV complete this kind of model could be via Loop Quantum Gravity
(LQG) [ 387 ] since, a priori, LQG does not fix the number of spatial
dimensions. First attempts to add spacelike extra dimensions to LQG were
made in Refs. [ 388 , 389 , 390 , 391 , 392 , 393 , 394 , 395 , 396 ,
397 ] .

The most popular way to overcome the geometrical hierarchy problem is
the warped extra dimension scenario proposed in 1999 by L. Randall and
R. Sundrum (RS) in Ref. [ 40 ] , known as the RS1 model. A less known
approach is the compactification of @xmath spacelike extra dimension on
a compact hyperbolic manifold with a large genus (number of holes)
proposed in 2000 in Ref. [ 251 ] (see also Ref. [ 252 ] ).

The goal of the present work is to discuss another compactification
geometry which may solve the geometrical hierarchy problem in ADD-like
models. In 2005, H.D. Kim proposed in Ref. [ 69 ] to realize ADD’s idea
by compactifying a LED on a 1D singular variety: a metric graph ³ ³ 3
Metric graphs have interesting applications in physics, chemistry and
mathematics (c.f. Ref. [ 398 ] for a short review). A 2D QFT on a star
graph background was developped in Refs. [ 399 , 400 , 401 , 402 ] . ,
like a star or a rose with respectively @xmath leaves/petals of equal
length/circumference @xmath . The reader can find a mathematical
introduction to the spectral analysis of differential operators defined
on metric graphs, the so-called quantum graphs, in Ref. [ 403 ] . In
Ref. [ 69 ] , it was shown that, for large @xmath , one can build a
phenomenologically viable model with only a single LED which gives
sizable submillimeter deviations from the Newtonian law of gravity in
tabletop experiments. The KK mass scale is @xmath meV. Here, we want to
push the concept further and we take @xmath close to @xmath for large
@xmath , so @xmath TeV which does not reintroduce a scale hierarchy and
evade all constrains on traditional ADD models (with a compactification
on a low dimensional torus) from submillimeter tests of Newtonian
gravity, astrophysics and cosmology. The integer @xmath is radiatively
stable so the scenario solves completely the naturalness problem of the
Higgs mass under the hypothesis of an exact global permutation symmetry
between the leaves/petals. Ref. [ 69 ] gives no information on the way
to embed the SM fields into the proposed geometry. Are they bulk or
brane-localized fields? In this work, we will see that the SM fields
must be localized on a 3-brane and we find it particulary interesting to
localize them on the junction (central vertex) of the star/rose graph.

In the context of the compactification of an extra dimension on a metric
graph, the star graph is the most popular [ 69 , 350 , 357 , 355 , 351 ,
404 ] , mainly because, with AdS @xmath leaves, these effective 5D
braneworlds capture the low energy behavior of models with warped
throats, arising in flux compactification in type IIB superstring theory
[ 405 , 343 , 344 , 352 , 353 , 406 , 350 ] , when one integrates out
the modes associated to the transverse dimensions of the throats. In
this work, we study a spacelike extra dimension compactified on a flat
star/rose graph with identical leaves/petals by adopting a bottom-up
approach: we are completely agnostic about the origin of this curious
geometry in a UV theory like string theories, LQG, etc.

The authors of Ref. [ 350 ] analyzed a Klein-Gordon field, a Dirac
field, a Maxwell field and Einsteinian gravity propagating in an extra
dimension compactified on a star with @xmath leaves of different
lengths. For that purpose, they define a copy of the same 5D field on
each leaf. The copies are connected at the junction of the star through
brane-localized interactions and the continuity of the metric. Of
course, a different 5D field on each leaf is not equivalent to only one
5D field defined on the whole star graph. In order to recover only one
zero mode propagating on the whole star, they add brane-localized mass
terms and take the limit of infinite masses such that @xmath zero modes
decouple from the Effective Field Theory (EFT). However, the meaning of
an infinite brane-localized mass term is not clear when the cut-off of
the EFT is not so far above the KK scale @xmath . That is why we choose
in this work the more straigtforward approach of Refs. [ 69 , 407 ]
where a 5D field is defined on the whole metric graph from the start.
For that purpose, one needs a distribution theory on the star/rose graph
allowing to define a Lagrangian with possible field discontinuities at
the junction. Instead of Schwartz’s distribution theory [ 373 , 372 ] ,
it is more appropriate to use a generalization of Kurasov’s one [ 408 ]
. In Section 6.2 , we give the definitions of a star/rose graph and
introduce the elements of the distribution theory we need.

The KK mass spectrum and wave functions of a 5D massless real scalar
field on a star/rose graph were studied in Ref. [ 69 ] . In Section 6.3
, we generalize it by adding a 5D mass to the scalar field. Besides, we
clarify the method and hypothesises of this previous study, especially
the hypothesis of continuity of the scalar field across the cental
vertex of the star/rose graph.

Recently, a 5D Dirac field with a compactification on a flat rose graph
was considered in Ref. [ 407 ] . They took petals of possibly different
circumferences and included a 5D Dirac mass for the fermion. In this
framework, they considered the rose graph as a master quantum graph
since one can reduce it to a star graph by a suitable choice of junction
conditions. They studied the general mathematical properties of the
junction conditions for the rose graph and classified them. Their work
was restricted to the analysis of the zero modes only: the KK mass
spectrum and wavefunctions of the excited modes were not considered.
They determined the number of zero mode solutions for each type of
boundary conditions in their classification. Their work was motivated by
the future goals of generating three fermion generations and the
features of the flavor sector of the SM fermions from the zero modes of
only one generation of 5D fermions. In Section 6.4 , we study the
particular case of a 5D massless Dirac field on a star/rose graph with
identical leaves/petals. We use a different approach compared to the one
of Ref. [ 407 ] . Instead of imposing arbitrary junction conditions, we
keep only the natural junction conditions at the vertices, i.e. the
junction conditions for which the variation of the action at the
vertices vanishes for arbitrary field variations [ 371 , 219 , 230 , 1 ,
409 ] . Indeed, we prefer junction conditions originating from the
variation of the action (and thus of the fields) at the vertices. We
will see that the natural junction conditions depend only on the
hypothesis of the continuity of the fields at the junction. In this
approach, we need the bilinear boundary terms for 5D fermions [ 62 , 63
, 64 , 65 , 66 , 67 , 68 , 1 , 409 ] whose importance was stressed in
Chapters 4 and 5 . Besides, we do not restrict ourselves to the study of
the zero modes only; we determine the KK mass spectrum and wavefunctions
of all KK modes.

In Section 6.5 , we propose a model to reduce the gravity scale to the
TeV scale with a large compactified volume, but with EW and KK scales
which coincide. The SM fields are localized on the 3-brane at the
central vertex of the star/rose, and we compute their couplings to
spinless KK-gravitons. We find that the results are very different from
standard ADD models in the literature, due to the very specific features
of the rose/star graph with identical leaves/petals. We also discuss
briefly what kind of physics is expected in the Planckian and
trans-Planckian regime of the model, the possibility of a hidden sector
made of KK-gravitons and of a dark matter candidate: a stable black hole
remnant [ 410 , 411 , 412 , 413 ] , the Planckion [ 414 , 415 ] .

In Section 6.6 , we revisit the models of Refs. [ 37 , 38 , 39 ] , which
generate small Dirac neutrino masses with right-handed neutrinos
identified with the zero modes of gauge singlet fermions propagating in
a large compactified volume, by adapting this idea to our spacetime
geometries. We consider a toy model with only one generation of
neutrinos. We use alternatively the zero mode approximation and the
exact treatment concerning the brane-localized Yukawa coupling between
the SM Higgs field with the 5D neutrino and the 4D left-handed neutrino
of the SM particle content. For this exact treatment of a
brane-localized Yukawa interaction, we use the 5D method that we
developped in Ref. [ 1 , 409 ] with other authors. We find that a large
number of KK-neutrinos are sterile and are part of the hidden sector of
the proposed models.

We conclude and propose some perspectives in Section 6.7 . In Appendix A
, we give our conventions for the 5D Minkowski metric, the Dirac
matrices and spinors.

#### 6.2 Star & Rose Graphs

##### 6.2.1 Geometries

In this subsection, we define the geometries on which we compactify. The
reader is refered to Chapter 1 of Ref. [ 403 ] for basic definitions,
vocabulary and properties of metric and quantum graphs which we will use
in what follows.

###### @xmath-star –

The @xmath -star @xmath (c.f. Fig. 6.2 ) is defined as the flat
equilateral star graph with @xmath bonds directed from 1 vertex of
degree @xmath to @xmath vertices of degree 1. It is a flat 1D space of
volume @xmath obtained by gluing @xmath intervals (the leaves) of length
@xmath at a common boundary @xmath (the junction). The @xmath leaf ends
at the opposite side of the junction @xmath : the boundary @xmath .
@xmath is symmetric under the group @xmath , which is the set of all
permutations of the @xmath leaves. For example, @xmath is the interval
of length @xmath , @xmath the interval of length @xmath symmetric under
a reflection ( @xmath ) with respect to the midpoint @xmath , and @xmath
is a claw. The couple of coordinates @xmath are assigned to every point
of the @xmath leaf with the identification:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

###### @xmath-rose –

The @xmath -rose @xmath (c.f. Fig. 6.2 ) is defined as the flat
equilateral rose graph (also called rhodonea or bouquet of circles),
with @xmath directed loops (1 vertex of degree @xmath ). It is a flat 1D
space of volume @xmath obtained by gluing the boundaries of @xmath
intervals (the petals), of radius @xmath and circumference @xmath , at a
single point @xmath (the vertex/junction). @xmath is symmetric under the
group @xmath , which is the set of all permutations of the @xmath
petals. For example, @xmath is a circle, @xmath a lemniscat, @xmath a
trifolium, and @xmath a quadrifolium. The couple of coordinates @xmath
is assigned to every point of the @xmath petal, with the
identifications:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

##### 6.2.2 Distribution Theory on a Star/Rose Graph

In order to study a field theory on @xmath or @xmath with localized
interactions at the vertices, one needs to define a distribution theory
on these metric graphs. To be general, we allow the test functions to be
discontinuous at the junction. The usual Schwartz’s distribution theory
[ 373 , 372 ] is thus not suitable and one should consider instead a
generalization on metric graphs of Kurasov’s distribution theory [ 408 ]
. Up to our knowledge, such a generalization on metric graphs was not
considered in the literature. We will thus define in this subsection the
objects we need for our study.

###### Function on @xmath –

A complex function @xmath on the metric graph @xmath is defined as:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

For each @xmath , we define a function:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

-   @xmath is continuous/differentiable at @xmath if @xmath is
    continuous/differentiable at @xmath . The derivative of @xmath at
    @xmath is @xmath .

-   @xmath is continuous across the junction if

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (6.9)
      -- -------- -- -------

    If it is not the case, @xmath is discontinuous/multivalued at the
    junction.

###### Test function on @xmath –

The set of test functions @xmath is the set of all complex functions
@xmath on @xmath such that the functions @xmath are infinitely
differentiable bounded functions on @xmath . We stress that a function
@xmath and/or its derivatives can be discontinuous at the junction.

###### Distribution –

A distribution @xmath is a linear form on @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where for every compact set @xmath , there exist constants @xmath and
@xmath such that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Regular distribution –

For any integrable complex function @xmath on @xmath , one can define a
regular distribution @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

A distribution which is not regular is singular.

###### Product of distributions –

If @xmath and @xmath , one can define the product @xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

If @xmath is the regular distribution associated to @xmath , the product
@xmath is defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Dirac distribution –

The Dirac distribution on @xmath centered at @xmath is the singular
distribution @xmath defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

We want to build a Dirac-like distribution @xmath centered at @xmath to
localize interactions at the junction. Consider the @xmath -star @xmath
. Let @xmath be an infinitely differentiable real function on @xmath
such that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

We define @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath , and we associate the regular distribution @xmath to it.
The Dirac distribution @xmath at the junction @xmath is defined as the
weak limit:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

We have

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (6.20)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

We conclude that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the same way, one can build a Dirac distribution @xmath at the vertx
@xmath of the @xmath -rose @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is defined as in Eq. ( 6.18 ) and @xmath is an infinitely
differentiable real function on @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

and normalized as in Eq. 6.17 . Then,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

We have thus defined a Dirac distribution centered at the junction
@xmath which acts on test functions possibly discontinuous at @xmath .

###### Distributional derivative –

In Kurasov’s distribution theory, one defines a distributional
derivative in the same way as in Schwartz’s distribution theory. The
distributional derivative @xmath of a distribution @xmath is defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

The derivative of a regular distribution @xmath is thus

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the regular distribution associated to derivative @xmath
. As in original Kurasov’s distribution theory, the distributional
derivative does not coincide with the derivative defined in the
classical sense. For instance, the distributional derivative of the
regular distribution associated to a constant function is not zero. For
the unit function @xmath , we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

Instead, it would be more natural to define the distributional
derivative as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

However, in this case, a distributional derivative of the Dirac
distributions @xmath and @xmath would involve Dirac distributions
squared which is not defined. Therefore, the price to pay in order to
define a usefull distributional derivative is to have extra boundary
terms at the vertices, compared to the traditional distributional
derivative for a regular distribution in Schwartz’s distribution theory.
One can thus define the @xmath derivative of the Dirac distribution
@xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Moment expansion –

We will adapt the moment expansion [ 416 ] of Schwartz’s distribution
theory to our case. Consider the @xmath -star. The Taylor series of a
test function @xmath is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then, the action of the previous regular distribution @xmath is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

We define the @xmath moment of the function @xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

Thus,

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (6.33)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

A similar result is obtained with the @xmath -rose. We define the moment
expansion of @xmath by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

##### 6.2.3 Star/Rose Extra Dimension

We want to study a field theory on the flat factorizable geometry @xmath
, with @xmath or @xmath . The coordinates can be split as @xmath , where
@xmath are the coordinates of @xmath . One has @xmath , and @xmath . The
junction @xmath and the boundaries @xmath break explicitely the 5D
Lorentz-Poincaré symmetries to the 4D ones, but the 5D symmetries are
still preserved locally in the bulk, in the same way as orbifold fixed
points. The junction and boundaries are thus 3-branes where one can
localize 4D fields and brane-localized kinetic and/or interaction terms
for the bulk fields. The 3-branes at the boundaries are called @xmath
-branes, and the 3-brane at the junction is called @xmath -brane for
@xmath .

One can consider 5D fields which propagate only in one petal/leaf as in
Refs. [ 350 , 357 , 355 , 351 , 404 ] , or 5D fields which propagate
into all the star/rose graph. In this latter case, it is straightforward
to generalize our discussion of functions defined on @xmath to the case
of 5D fields. The 5D fields can be discontinuous at the junction and
thus multivalued at this point. One can interpret it from an EFT point
of view (which is always the case in any realistic model with
interactions): the value of the field at the point @xmath is the one at
the neighborhood but outside the core of the @xmath -brane, since its
microscopic description is outside the range of validity of the EFT. One
should think the point @xmath of the graph as @xmath . Therefore, the
fact that the field is multivalued at the junction is not a problem. It
is convenient to define the field theory within a distributional
approach with respect to the coordinates @xmath , where the 5D fields
are functions of @xmath but linear forms which act on functions of
@xmath .

#### 6.3 5D Klein-Gordon Field on a Star/Rose Graph

##### 6.3.1 Klein-Gordon Equation & Junction/Boundary Conditions

We study a 5D real scalar field @xmath of mass dimension 3/2 and of mass
@xmath defined on @xmath . The 5D fields @xmath are supposed to be
smooth functions on the interval @xmath . We associate to @xmath a
regular distribution @xmath . The Lagrangian @xmath describing the
dynamics of @xmath is defined at the level of distributions. The action
is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

with the unit test function @xmath , and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath . We do not include brane-localized kinetic/mass/interaction
terms, and the boundary terms are chosen to have Neumann-like conditions
at the junction and boundaries. The action reduces to the standard form
for a Klein-Gordon field:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the boundary terms coming from the distributional derivatives
cancel each other.

@xmath can be continuous or discontinuous across the @xmath -brane. This
feature depends on the microscopic structure of the @xmath -brane in the
UV completion. We apply Hamilton’s principle to the action @xmath , with
arbitrary variations @xmath of @xmath in the bulk and on the branes. The
@xmath ’s inherite the (dis)continuity properties from @xmath across the
@xmath -brane and we extract the junction and boundary conditions from
integrals over total derivatives. We get the Klein-Gordon equation:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

Neumann boundary conditions on the @xmath -branes:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the junction condition depends on the (dis)continuity of @xmath :

-   If @xmath is allowed to be discontinuous across the junction, we get
    Neumann junction conditions:

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.40)
      -- -------- -- --------

    We say that the @xmath -brane is airtight to the field @xmath ,
    which means that the spectrum is equivalent to the one obtained by
    disconnecting the @xmath bonds at the vertex @xmath into @xmath
    disjoined intervals. A brane which is airtight to the field behaves
    like a boundary for this field.

-   If we impose to @xmath to be continuous across the junction, we get
    a Neumann-Kirchhoff junction condition:

      -- -- -- --------
               (6.41)
      -- -- -- --------

    with @xmath . When @xmath is continuous across the junction, the
    leaves/petals communicate through the @xmath -brane which is thus
    not airtight.

##### 6.3.2 Kaluza-Klein Dimensional Reduction

We will not study here the KK dimensional reduction when @xmath is
allowed to be discontinuous across the junction since it reduces to a 5D
scalar field on @xmath disjoined intervals. The case of a 5D scalar
field on an interval is very well known in the literature [ 417 ] . In
the following, we focus on the continuous case.

###### Separation of Variables

We perform the KK dimensional reduction of the 5D field theory to an
effective 4D one in terms of KK degrees of freedom. A general 5D field
@xmath can be expanded as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

We label each KK mode solution by a triplet @xmath , where:

-   @xmath labels the different KK towers for the same 5D field which
    are defined by different mass spectra (see below);

-   @xmath labels the levels in the KK tower @xmath ;

-   @xmath labels the degenerate modes for each KK level @xmath . We
    choose the notation @xmath , instead of the more appropriate one
    @xmath , for simplifying the notations since we will see that each
    KK level for a KK tower @xmath has the same degeneracy: there is
    thus no ambiguity.

The 5D equation ( 6.38 ) splits into the Klein-Gordon equations for the
4D fields @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

with

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the differential equations for the wave functions @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the mass squared of the KK modes @xmath , and @xmath is
an eigenvalue of the operator @xmath on @xmath associated to the
eigenfunctions @xmath . The orthonormalization conditions for the wave
functions @xmath are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

The conditions on the 5D field @xmath on the 3-branes are naturally
transposed to conditions on the KK wave functions @xmath .

###### Zero Modes

We are looking for zero mode solutions ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ) of
Eq. ( 6.45 ). For both compactifications on @xmath and @xmath , there is
only one zero mode ( @xmath ) whose wave function is flat, such that:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Excited Modes

###### @xmath @xmath-Star

The general solutions of Eq. ( 6.45 ), satisfying the Neumann boundary
conditions ( 6.39 ), are of the form:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath . The continuity condition on the wave functions at the
@xmath -brane gives

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

which leads to two kinds of excited KK modes: the KK wave functions
@xmath can vanish or not on the @xmath -brane.

###### First case: @xmath

Eq. ( 6.49 ) gives the KK mass spectrum

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

which defines the KK tower @xmath . The Neumann-Kirchhoff junction
condition ( 6.41 ) implies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

Each KK level @xmath is thus @xmath times degenerate ( @xmath ) and the
KK wave functions are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

with the @xmath -vector basis:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath               
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.53)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

###### Second case: @xmath

We have @xmath so Eq. ( 6.49 ) gives

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Kirchhoff junction condition ( 6.41 ) leads to the KK mass spectrum

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

which defines the KK tower with @xmath whose KK levels are not
degenerate ( @xmath ). The KK wave functions are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### @xmath @xmath-Rose

Again, to satisfy the continuity condition at the @xmath -brane, the KK
wave functions @xmath can vanish or not at the vertex.

###### First case: @xmath

The general solutions of Eq. ( 6.45 ) with @xmath are of the form:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath . The periodicity condition for each petal at the vertex
gives @xmath . Moreover, the Neumann-Kirchhoff junction condition ( 6.41
) implies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

There are thus two possibilities:

-   First possibility:
    The KK mass spectrum is

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.59)
      -- -------- -- --------

    and defines the KK tower @xmath . From the conditions ( 6.58 ), we
    get Eq. ( 6.51 ) so @xmath and the KK wave functions are

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.60)
      -- -------- -- --------

    with the @xmath -vector basis ( 6.53 ).

-   Second possibility:
    The KK mass spectrum is

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.61)
      -- -------- -- --------

    which satisfies Eq. ( 6.58 ) and defines the KK tower @xmath . We
    get @xmath and the KK wave functions are

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.62)
      -- -------- -- --------

    with the @xmath -vector basis:

      -- -------- -------- -- --------
         @xmath   @xmath      
         @xmath   @xmath      
         @xmath               
         @xmath   @xmath      (6.63)
      -- -------- -------- -- --------

###### Second case: @xmath

The KK mass spectrum is the same as in Eq. ( 6.61 ). Each KK level
@xmath is thus degenerate with the @xmath KK modes of the level @xmath
so @xmath : we label the KK modes with non-vanishing wave functions at
the junction by the triplet @xmath . The KK wave functions are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

Finally, we insist on the fact that all KK towers labeled by @xmath are
present in the spectrum: they do not correspond to different models. The
5D field @xmath has one zero mode of mass @xmath in both geometries (
@xmath or @xmath ) and excited modes. For a massless 5D field ( @xmath
), the mass gap between the KK modes is of the order of @xmath . Some of
the KK modes have wave functions which vanish at the junction. We will
see a physical application of these results in Subsection 6.5.3 , where
we will study a toy model of a 5D spinless graviton which is just a real
scalar field with @xmath . The zero mode is thus identified with the 4D
massless graviton (where we do not take into account the spin).

#### 6.4 5D Massless Dirac Field on a Star/Rose Graph

##### 6.4.1 Dirac-Weyl Equations & Junction/Boundary Conditions

We study a 5D massless Dirac field

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.65)
  -- -------- -- --------

of mass dimension 2 defined on @xmath , where the fields @xmath and
@xmath describe fermion fields of left and right-handed 4D chirality
respectively. To the function @xmath , we associate the regular
distribution @xmath . The action is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

with the Lagrangian

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are the 5D Dirac matrices ⁴ ⁴ 4 Our
conventions for the Dirac algebra is given in Appendix A . We include
the bilinear boundary terms at the vertices with @xmath . The relative
sign between the HS terms at @xmath and @xmath is chosen in order to
allow the existence of zero modes [ 1 , 409 ] . If we flip the sign of
@xmath , we exchange the features of the left and right-handed KK modes.
In what follows, we choose @xmath .

The action can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.68)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the boundary terms coming from the distributional derivatives
cancel each other. The conserved Noether current associated to the
symmetry @xmath , with @xmath , is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.69)
  -- -------- -- --------

Current conservation requires a Kirchhoff condition for the current at
the junction:

  -- -- -- --------
           (6.70)
  -- -- -- --------

For the component @xmath one gets at the junction:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.71)
  -- -------- -- --------

We apply Hamilton’s principle to the action @xmath , with arbitrary
variations of the fields @xmath in the bulk and on the branes. We get
the massless Dirac-Weyl equations for the 5D fields @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.72)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore, when the fields are on-shell, @xmath and @xmath are not
independent so the junction/boundary conditions must not overconstrain
@xmath and @xmath at the same point [ 65 , 66 , 409 ] . The addition of
the HS terms guarantee that only @xmath is constrained on the branes by
the minimization of the action [ 65 , 66 , 1 , 409 ] . We get the
Dirichlet boundary conditions at the @xmath -branes:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.73)
  -- -------- -- --------

The fields @xmath and @xmath can be taken independently (dis)continuous
across the junction. @xmath is (dis)continuous as @xmath . One can
explore the different possibilities of junction conditions for @xmath ,
depending on the (dis)continuity of the fields here, summarized in Tab.
6.2 :

-   Case 1: If both @xmath and @xmath are allowed to be discontinuous,
    one gets Dirichlet junction conditions:

      -- -- -- --------
               (6.74)
      -- -- -- --------

    which correspond to a 5D field @xmath defined on @xmath disjoined
    intervals. The spectrum of a 5D fermion on an interval is well known
    in the literature [ 50 ] . The @xmath -brane is airtight, which is
    illustrated by the fact that each incoming or outcoming current at
    the @xmath -brane vanishes like at a boundary ( 6.71 ). There is a
    chiral zero mode (here right-handed) in each leaf/petal and a KK
    tower of vector-like fermions with a mass gap of @xmath . If one
    generation of the SM fermion sector propagates on a @xmath -star/
    @xmath -rose it is possible to generate three generations at the
    level of zero modes with a airtight @xmath -brane. The mechanism is
    the same as Refs. [ 418 , 419 , 420 , 421 , 422 , 423 ] with point
    interactions along an interval/circle to generate several zero modes
    from a unique discontinuous 5D fermion field.

-   Case 2: If we impose that both @xmath and @xmath are continuous, we
    obtain no additional boundary condition at the @xmath -brane, but a
    Dirichlet condition ( 6.74 ) for @xmath at the @xmath -brane.

-   Case 3: If we impose only the continuity on @xmath , there is a
    Dirichlet condition ( 6.74 ) for @xmath at the @xmath -brane.

-   Case 4: If we impose only the continuity on @xmath , Hamilton’s
    principle gives a Kirchhoff junction condition for @xmath at the
    @xmath -brane:

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.75)
      -- -------- -- --------

    which solves the current condition ( 6.71 ).

For the physical applications in this article, we will add
brane-localized terms at the junction for @xmath , which are in general
are incompatible with the continuity of @xmath [ 1 , 409 ] . In this
article, we will not consider airtight branes so we impose only that
@xmath is continuous at the junction in what follows.

##### 6.4.2 Kaluza-Klein Dimensional Reduction

###### Separation of Variables

In order to perform the KK dimensional reduction of the 5D field theory,
we use the same method as in Subsection 6.3.2 for the scalar field, with
the same system of labels for the KK modes. We expand the 5D fields
@xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.76)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are 4D Weyl fields and @xmath are wave functions defined on
@xmath . The 5D equations ( 6.72 ) split into Dirac-Weyl equations for
the 4D fields @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.77)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the differential equation for the wave functions @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.78)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the mass of the KK modes @xmath . The wave functions
@xmath are orthonormalized with the conditions

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.79)
  -- -------- -- --------

The conditions on the 5D field @xmath at the vertices are naturally
transposed to conditions on the KK wave functions @xmath .

###### Zero Modes

We are looking for zero mode solutions ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ) of
Eq. ( 6.78 ) for which the first order differential equations are
decoupled. For both compactifications on @xmath and @xmath , there is
only one right-handed zero mode ( @xmath ). Its wave function is
continuous across the @xmath -brane and flat:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.80)
  -- -------- -- --------

For the left-handed zero modes, it is necessary to distinguish between
the compactification on @xmath and @xmath .

###### @xmath @xmath-Star

There is no left-handed zero mode for @xmath . The theory is thus chiral
at the level of the zero mode, which generalizes the well known result
of the particular case of a compactification on the interval @xmath .
The compactification on a star graph is thus very interesting since it
allows to build models where the SM fields propagate in the extra
dimension: the SM particles are identified with the zero modes of the 5D
fields. In Section 6.6 , we will identify the right-handed neutrinos
with the zero modes of 5D Dirac fields coupled to brane-localized 4D
left-handed neutrinos. The goal is to propose a toy model to obtain
small Dirac neutrino masses.

###### @xmath @xmath-Rose

For @xmath , we have @xmath degenerate left-handed zero modes ( @xmath
). The theory is vector-like at the level of the zero modes, which
generalizes the result of the compactification on a circle @xmath in the
literature. Therefore, with the compactification on a rose graph and
without an airtight @xmath -brane, one cannot build models with the SM
fields propagating in the extra dimension except if one is able to
propose a mechanism which generates chirality by giving a mass to the
mirror partners of the SM fermions. If this is possible, one recovers
the three SM generations by taking @xmath . The KK wave functions @xmath
are flat in each petal and discontinuous across the @xmath -brane
(except for @xmath , the circle, where they can be taken continuous):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.81)
  -- -------- -- --------

with the @xmath -vector basis ( 6.63 ).

###### Excited Modes

We are looking for massive KK modes ( @xmath ). The coupled first order
differential equations ( 6.78 ) can be decoupled into second order ones:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.82)
  -- -------- -- --------

The KK wave functions @xmath are continuous across the junction. In the
same way as in the case of the scalar field, it is necessary to
distinguish between the cases where the @xmath ’s vanish or not at the
junction. One can follow the same method as in Subsection 6.3.2 . We
will not give again all the details here since there is no major
technical difference. We summarize the results in what follows.

###### @xmath @xmath-Star

###### First case: @xmath

The KK mass spectrum is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.83)
  -- -------- -- --------

and defines the KK tower @xmath . Each KK level is @xmath times
degenerate ( @xmath ) and the KK wave functions are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.84)
  -- -------- -- --------

with the @xmath -vector basis ( 6.53 ). The @xmath ’s are discontinuous
across the @xmath -brane (except for @xmath , the interval, where they
are taken continuous).

###### Second case: @xmath

The KK mass spectrum is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.85)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is not degenerate ( @xmath ) and defines the KK tower @xmath . The
KK wave functions are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.86)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the @xmath ’s can be taken continuous across the @xmath -brane.

###### @xmath @xmath-Rose

###### First case: @xmath

There are two cases:

-   First case:
    The KK mass spectrum is

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.87)
      -- -------- -- --------

    and defines the KK tower @xmath with @xmath . The KK wave functions
    are

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.88)
      -- -------- -- --------

    with the @xmath -vector basis ( 6.53 ). The @xmath ’s are
    discontinuous across the @xmath -brane.

-   Second possibility:
    The KK mass spectrum is

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.89)
      -- -------- -- --------

    and defines the KK tower @xmath with @xmath . The KK wave functions
    are

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.90)
      -- -------- -- --------

    with the @xmath -vector basis ( 6.63 ). The @xmath ’s are
    discontinuous across the @xmath -brane (except for @xmath , the
    circle, where they can be taken continuous).

###### Second case: @xmath

The KK mass spectrum is the same as in Eq. ( 6.89 ). Each KK level
@xmath is thus degenerate with the @xmath KK modes of the level @xmath
so @xmath : we label the KK modes with non-vanishing wave functions at
the junction by the triplet @xmath . The KK wave functions are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.91)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the @xmath ’s can be taken continuous across the @xmath -brane.

Like for the scalar field, all KK towers labeled by @xmath are present
in the spectrum. Each excited KK level is vector-like for both
compactifications, and the mass gap between the KK modes is of the order
of @xmath .

#### 6.5 A Low 5D Planck Scale with a Star/Rose Extra Dimension

In this section, we propose an ADD model with brane-localized 4D SM
fields where gravity propagates in a large star/rose extra dimension
with large @xmath and a natural value for @xmath .

##### 6.5.1 Lowering the Gravity Scale

With a LED compactified on a metric graph @xmath or @xmath , one can
obtain a low 5D Planck scale. In this case, Eq. ( 6.2 ) gives

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.92)
  -- -------- -- --------

To solve the gauge hierarchy problem with the hypothesis of an exact
global @xmath symmetry (see Section 6.7 for a discussion when this
hypothesis is relaxed), we choose @xmath TeV, obtained with @xmath m. In
order to be in the EFT regime, i.e. below the 5D Planck scale, we need
@xmath , with @xmath m. In practice, @xmath with a large @xmath should
be enough, and thus a KK mass scale near the EW scale: @xmath GeV. Such
heavy KK-gravitons evade completely the constrains from submillimeter
tests of 4D gravitational Newtons’s law, stellar physics and cosmology
(c.f. footnote 2 p. 2 ). If one allows for @xmath of fine tuning for
@xmath by pushing @xmath up to 10 TeV with @xmath , one can even allow
for @xmath TeV. Moreover, if the concepts of space and volume still make
sense at the Planck scale @xmath , by taking @xmath and @xmath to get
@xmath TeV, there is no tower of KK-gravitons in the EFT, instead the
first experimental hints for a low 5D Planck scale are strongly coupled
quantum gravity phenomena near @xmath . Such a large @xmath seems
puzzling at first glance: the reader would wonder whether our
proposition is just a reformulation of the gauge hierarchy into why
@xmath is large. However, in the EFT, @xmath is a conserved integer so
it is stable under radiative corrections, it does not need to be
dynamically stabilized, and has no preferred value. When @xmath , the
models proposed in this article are formulated in the context of EFTs
defined on a classical background spacetime @xmath , where the number of
leaves/petals @xmath is fixed by the definition of the model, even in
presence of gravity. Possibly, @xmath becomes a dynamical quantity in a
theory of Planckian gravity involving a quantum spacetime. The situation
is somewhat similar to other beyond SM scenarii in the literature to
solve the hierarchy problem:

-   The model of Ref. [ 251 ] where @xmath spacelike dimension are
    compactified on a compact hyperbolic manifold of genus @xmath (the
    number of holes) and of volume @xmath . A compact hyperbolic
    manifold has two length scales: a curvature radius @xmath and a
    linear size @xmath . For @xmath , we have

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.93)
      -- -------- -- --------

    For @xmath , @xmath TeV, and @xmath , the formula gives @xmath so
    the number of holes is very large: @xmath .

-   The model of Refs. [ 237 , 424 ] , where @xmath spacelike extra
    dimensions are stabilized by a large number @xmath of branes with
    inter-brane forces, forming a brane crystal.

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.94)
      -- -------- -- --------

    for @xmath TeV, where @xmath is a parameter which controls the
    inter-brane distance. One should have @xmath in order to be in the
    regime where general relativity is valid and also to avoid a new
    fine tuning.

-   The model proposed by G.R. Dvali et al. in Refs. [ 154 , 155 , 425 ,
    426 , 427 , 428 , 429 ] involving a large number @xmath of particle
    species. This is a 4D model where the scale at which gravity becomes
    strongly coupled @xmath is given by

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.95)
      -- -------- -- --------

    This effect can be understood perturbatively as being the result of
    the radiative corrections of @xmath particle species to the graviton
    propagator. Then, @xmath TeV for @xmath . From Eqs. ( 6.92 ) and (
    6.95 ) it is a curious coincidence that @xmath when @xmath . One can
    make the same remarks for the number of branes in the brane crystal
    model when @xmath in Eq. ( 6.94 ), which means that the inter-brane
    distance is the fundamental Planck length.

-   The model of @xmath -naturalness proposed by N. Arkani-Hamed et al.
    in Ref. [ 430 ] . There are @xmath SM-like sectors which are
    mutually non-interacting. The Higgs mass parameter squared @xmath
    takes values between @xmath and @xmath , where @xmath is the scale
    common to the @xmath sectors that cuts the quadratic divergences to
    @xmath . Then, for a wide range of @xmath distributions, one expects
    that some sectors are accidentally tuned at the @xmath level, such
    that @xmath . The sector with the smallest non-zero Vacuum
    Expectation Value (VEV) is identified with our sector. When @xmath ,
    @xmath has thus to be large in order to have @xmath GeV. There is no
    need for new physics at the TeV scale!

The only quantity which needs to be dynamically stabilized is the leaf
(petal) length (circumference) @xmath , otherwise the radion, i.e. the
scalar field which represents the fluctuations of @xmath , remains
massless and conflicts with the null result from the search for a new
force of infinite range. Moreover, if only the graviton propagates into
the extra dimension, the bosonic quantum loops are known to make the
extra dimension unstable, which shrinks to a point [ 431 , 432 ] . On
the one hand, if @xmath , the corrections of Planckian gravity can
safely be neglected (EFT regime), and it is important to add a field
theoretical mechanism to the model to stabilize @xmath . On the other
hand, if @xmath , one expects @xmath corrections from Planckian gravity,
and one needs a complete theory of gravity to formulate the model and to
address its stabilization.

In the EFT regime, we have supposed the existence of an exact global
@xmath symmetry of the @xmath -star/rose, which is not realistic since
gravity is supposed to break global symmetries (see Section 6.7 for a
discussion on the impact on the resolution of the gauge hierarchy
problem). This is reminiscent of the 5D models with a Universal Extra
Dimension (UED) compactified on an interval symmetric under an exact
@xmath reflection with respect to its midpoint [ 209 ] . One can also
mention the model of Ref. [ 433 ] where two identical slices of AdS
@xmath are glued to a common UV-brane. The extra dimension of these
models can be stabilized by the dynamics of additonal bulk fields at the
quantum level by a balance between the contribution of bosonic and
fermionic loops [ 434 ] , or at the classical level by a potential for a
scalar field as in the Goldberger-Wise mechanism originally proposed for
the RS1 model [ 260 , 435 , 261 ] . In Ref. [ 351 ] , it is shown how to
stabilize a @xmath -star @xmath with the potential of a different scalar
field in each leaf, these @xmath scalar fields are related by the @xmath
symmetry. One can apply these mechanisms here with @xmath large. Other
stabilization mechanisms were proposed in Ref. [ 237 ] , in particular
it is possible to stabilize an extra dimension compactified on a circle
with the help of a complex scalar field with a topologically conserved
winding number. As it is possible to stabilize one petal by this
mechanism, one can repeat it with a different scalar field in each petal
of the @xmath -rose @xmath . Both for @xmath and @xmath , the @xmath
scalar fields meet only at the junction @xmath and we assume that they
interact only through gravity, like the @xmath copies of the SM in Ref.
[ 155 , 428 ] . Therefore, the picture reduces to stabilize @xmath
independent leaves/petals, which is a simplified version of the
mechanism in Ref. [ 351 ] . If the bulk fields in all leaves/petals have
an exact global @xmath symmetry, the geometrical @xmath symmetry is
preserved (see Section 6.7 for a discussion when it is not the case).

##### 6.5.2 Embedding the Standard Model Fields

Up to this subsection we did not mention how we embed the SM fields into
the proposed spacetime geometries. On the one hand, in the ADD-like
models in the literature, the SM fields must be localized on a 3-brane,
while gravity and possibly other exotic fields propagate in the bulk [
34 , 35 , 36 , 38 , 237 , 303 , 302 ] . On the other hand, in the
RS1-like models, one can allow some or all SM fields to propagate in the
extra dimension [ 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 436 , 437 , 438 ] . One
reason is that the KK scale in the ADD and RS1 models are respectively
below and above the TeV scale. The absence of discovery of low mass KK
excitations for the SM particles rules out an ADD model with bulk SM
fields. In the case of an ADD model with a star extra dimension, where
it is possible to embed a chiral model at the zero mode level, one can
naively think that it allows the SM fields to propagate in the bulk with
a KK mass scale @xmath TeV. However, one should also consider the
magnitude of the couplings of the zero mode gauge bosons. In the RS1
model with a 5D gauge field, the 5D gauge coupling @xmath (of mass
dimension @xmath ) is related to the zero mode gauge coupling @xmath by
the relation [ 42 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.96)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the proper length of the warped extra dimension. @xmath
is not large compared to the 5D Planck length @xmath , so for a natural
gauge coupling

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.97)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is the good magnitude for a SM gauge coupling. However, in the ADD
model with a @xmath D gauge field, the higher dimensional gauge coupling
@xmath (of mass dimension @xmath ) is related to the zero mode gauge
coupling @xmath by the relation [ 225 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.98)
  -- -------- -- --------

With a natural value for the gauge coupling

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.99)
  -- -------- -- --------

one obtains with Eq. ( 6.2 ):

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.100)
  -- -------- -- ---------

so @xmath is a very tiny coupling and cannot be identified with a SM
gauge coupling. This result depends only on the volume of the
compactified space, i.e. on the hierarchy between the 4D and @xmath D
Planck scales. It is still valid for the geometries considered in this
article, where @xmath . Therefore, the gauge coupling argument is much
stronger than the one of the KK mass scale to rule out bulk SM fields:
it applies to every compactified geometry one can imagine to realize an
ADD model.

After this discussion, it is clear that in the case of a star/rose extra
dimension with a large @xmath , even if @xmath TeV, the SM fields must
be localized on a 3-brane, like in the other ADD models in the
literature. Consider a 5D EFT with a brane. The cut-off in the bulk and
the 3-brane thickness are noted @xmath and @xmath respectively. There
are two cases [ 382 ] :

-   The fat brane ( @xmath ): its microscopic description is in the
    range of validity of the 5D EFT. Usually, a fat brane is a
    topological defect [ 191 , 192 ] and it is necessary to provide a
    field theoretical mechanism to trap the zero modes of 5D fields of
    various spins in the neighborhood of the brane [ 193 , 194 , 198 ,
    439 , 199 ] . The topological defects are the first prototypes of
    braneworlds in the literature and are chosen by ADD to trap the SM
    fields in their first article on LEDs [ 34 ] . It is also possible
    to localize the zero modes of 5D fields towards orbifold fixed
    points or spacetime boundaries with large 5D masses of
    brane-localized kinetic terms [ 440 , 439 , 441 ] . Irrespectively
    of the trapping mechanism of the fat brane, we speak about
    quasi-localized 5D fields.

-   The thin brane ( @xmath ): its microscopic description is outside
    the range of validity of the 5D EFT. A thin brane is described in
    the EFT by an infinitely thin hypersurface where 4D fields are
    strictly localized [ 231 , 225 , 441 ] . The trapping mechanism of
    the fields is relegated to the UV completion. This case became
    popular when it was relalized that 4D fields can live in the
    worldvolume of solitonic objects in some UV completions, like
    D-brane stacks in superstring theories where matter fields are
    described by open strings attached to them [ 442 , 443 , 186 ] . In
    EFTs, orbifold fixed points, spacetime boundaries or metric graph
    vertices are perfect candidates for thin branes. One can also obtain
    a thin brane by integrating out the width of a fat brane: one gets
    an EFT with a cut-off equal to the the inverse of the brane width,
    and 4D fields (the zero modes of the quasi-localized 5D fields of
    the UV completion) strictly localized on the thin brane (depending
    on the quasi-localization mechanism, the excited KK-modes do not
    necessarily decouple [ 441 ] ). Quickly, after the theoretical
    discovery of D-branes, physicists explored the new possibilities
    offered by thin branes [ 35 , 36 , 40 , 208 , 444 , 445 , 446 , 157
    ] .

For the models studied in this article, if one considers quasi-localized
5D SM fields on the @xmath -branes (fat branes), one has a problem.
Indeed, consider the @xmath -star @xmath , the fat brane has a thickness
@xmath extended into each leaf, so a zero mode gauge coupling @xmath is
related to the 5D gauge coupling @xmath as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.101)
  -- -------- -- ---------

similar to Eqs. ( 6.96 )-( 6.98 ). As @xmath is large, the model will
suffer from the same problem as for bulk SM fields in ADD models: the
gauge couplings of the zero modes are too suppressed to match the values
measured in experiments. The same problem arises with a fat @xmath
-brane in the case of the @xmath -rose @xmath . However, there is no
problem with quasi-localized SM fields on a fat @xmath -brane where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.102)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Therefore, we will consider only 4D SM fields localized on thin @xmath
-branes ⁵ ⁵ 5 See Ref. [ 441 ] for a recent discussion on the
consistency of a 5D EFT coupled to gravity with 4D fields strictly
localized on a 3-brane. Only the argument in Subsection 5.1 in Ref. [
441 ] applies to our model (see discussion in Appendix B.5 ). : the SM
gauge fields do not arise from the limit of quasi-localized 5D fields
which propagate into the leaves/petals, so the gauge couplings are not
suppressed by @xmath . Moreover, spacetime symmetries allow us to
localize 4D degrees of freedom exactly on the 3-branes located at the
vertices. However, there are various arguments that gravity implies the
existence of a minimal length scale in Nature of the order of the
fundamental Planck length (see Ref. [ 447 ] for a review). Therefore, in
a UV completion including gravity, the singular behavior the singular
feature of the junction should be regularized. In Ref. [ 448 ] , it is
shown that the spectrum of a quantum graph can arise in the thin limit
of a “graph-like manifold”. Therefore, the metric graph structure of our
extra dimension could emerge from a UV completion where the internal
space is a @xmath D graph-like manifold with @xmath transverse
dimensions of 5D Planck size, and where the vertex at the junction is
regularized [ 350 ] . After integrating out these transverse dimensions,
one is left with only one extra dimension compactified on a metric
graph. Concerning the UV origin of the brane-localized 4D SM fields, we
adopt a bottom-up approach where we do not assume a specific UV
completion. We stress that it is crucial that it does not rely on
quasi-localized higher-dimensional fields propagating into the
leaves/petals. In fact, one can imagine a UV-completion with a @xmath D
graph-like manifold and a fat @xmath -brane made of @xmath D
quasi-localized fields. However, the wave functions of the zero modes
must be highly peaked inside the protrusion [ 398 ] at the vertex @xmath
, i.e. they must decrease quickly inside the vertex protrusion such that
they are suppressed at least by @xmath at the entrance of a leaf/petal
to avoid the problem of Eq. ( 6.101 ). One can also imagine another
UV-completion: if it is possible to generate graph-like 6D manifolds in
superstring theories, the 4D SM fields may live in the worldvolume of a
D-brane stack at the regularized @xmath vertex.

It is interesting to notice that if one localizes the SM fields on the
@xmath -branes of a star extra dimension, one has @xmath copies of the
SM fields, if one does not want to break explicitly the @xmath symmetry
of @xmath . Then, if one softly breaks this symmetry only by the mass
term of the Higgs field, one can hope to be able to realize the @xmath
-naturalness idea proposed in Ref. [ 430 ] , with the reheaton (the
field which populates the Universe after inflation by decaying into SM
particles and possibly other fields) as a bulk field. The Higgs mass
parameter is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.103)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where a first @xmath factor comes from the effect of the @xmath SM
fields copies coupled to gravity (c.f. ( 6.95 )), and a second one comes
from the uniform distribution of the parameters @xmath discussed in Ref.
[ 430 ] . Although there are @xmath copies of the SM fields, Ref. [ 430
] gives two explicit models where the reheaton decays preferencially
into our SM sector, which allows a large number of SM sectors subject to
the constraints from cosmology. Applied to our setup, it is thus
possible to have a higher @xmath with no new physics at the TeV scale,
which could explain the null result from the search for beyond SM
particles at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC, @xmath TeV). This idea
needs to be investigated deeper in the future. Here, we will consider
only one copy of the SM fields, and localize them on the @xmath -brane.
The gauge hierarchy is generated by the volume of the compactified extra
dimension, with strongly coupled quantum gravity effects accessible to
the LHC ( @xmath TeV) or a future hadronic collider.

##### 6.5.3 Phenomenology

###### Kaluza-Klein Gravitons

In an ADD model, gravity and possibly other exotic fields propagate into
the extra dimensions. It is crucial for our proposition to have an idea
of the implication of gravitons propagating into the bulk. The KK
dimensional reduction of a 5D graviton [ 225 ] leads to a tower of
KK-gravitons with a zero mode, and one massless graviscalar (the
radion). A massless graviphoton is also present if there is no boundary
for the extra dimension (present for the @xmath -rose @xmath and absent
for the @xmath -star @xmath ). As the existence of KK-gravitons can have
important phenomenological effects, one has to extract their KK mass
spectrum and their couplings to the SM fields. By a suitable gauge
choice, the Euler-Lagrange equations for a 5D massless graviton reduce
to Klein-Gordon equations. One can thus study a 5D massless real scalar
field coupled minimaly to the energy momentum tensor of the SM to obtain
the KK mass spectrum and the couplings of spinless KK-gravitons. This 5D
spinless graviton @xmath couples to the energy momentum sources through
the effective metric:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.104)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The metric @xmath and thus @xmath have to be continuous at the junction.
We focus on the compactification on @xmath . The case of @xmath is very
similar. The coupling of the 5D spinless graviton to the energy momentum
tensor

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.105)
  -- -------- -- ---------

of the 4D SM fields (of action @xmath ) localized on the @xmath -brane
is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.106)
  -- -------- -- ---------

One can use the KK decomposition of Subsection 6.3.2 with @xmath and
treat the brane-localized interactions with the SM fields as a
perturbation. The zero mode is identified with the 4D massless graviton.
We note @xmath the number of KK-modes which couple to the SM fields
below the cut-off @xmath . Only the KK-gravitons with a wave function
which does not vanish on the @xmath -brane couple to the SM fields. The
interaction term ( 6.106 ) gives

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.107)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.108)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The KK modes whose wave functions do not vanish at @xmath couple
individually to the energy momentum tensor of the SM with a coupling
suppressed by @xmath : they are thus very feebly coupled, and the
probability @xmath to emit a single KK-graviton is proportional to its
coupling squared:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.109)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the energy of matter originating from @xmath in Eq. (
6.107 ). We compare two benchmark scenarii with @xmath TeV:

###### Benchmark scenario #1 – @xmath.

This case is the traditional situation of ADD models in the literature
with only one extra dimension. From Eq. ( 6.92 ), we have @xmath eV,
which is excluded by the success of 4D gravitational Newton’s law at the
scale of the solar system. Eqs. ( 6.92 ) and ( 6.108 ) give

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.110)
  -- -------- -- ---------

so we have a large number of KK-gravitons below the cut-off. At
colliders with a center of mass energy which reaches @xmath , the
probability to produce one out of @xmath gravitons becomes then

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.111)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where we used Eqs. ( 6.92 ) , ( 6.108 ) and ( 6.109 ). This last result
is also valid in more realistic models with more than one extra
dimension which can pass with success the submillimeter tests of 4D
gravitational Newton’s law. The KK tower can thus be probed and
constrained at the LHC ( @xmath TeV), c.f. Ref. [ 386 ] .

###### Benchmark scenario #2 – @xmath.

In this case, the large volume in Eq. ( 6.92 ) is generated by a large
@xmath and @xmath GeV. Thus there are few KK modes which couple to the
SM fields: @xmath from Eq. ( 6.108 ), and @xmath at the LHC. So the KK
tower is completely invisible in current experiments. The
compactification on @xmath can thus circumvent the current LHC
constraints on the KK-gravitons of traditionnal ADD models.

However, these results follow from the zero-thickness brane hypothesis.
How are they modified by a brane width in the UV completion? Indeed, we
have already discussed that one expects that the singular behavior of
the junction is soften in a UV-completion including gravity. After
integrating out the UV degrees of freedom, one is left with an effective
brane form factor as in Ref. [ 449 ] to modelize the brane width ⁶ ⁶ 6
We stress that this effective brane form factor has nothing to do with
the wave function of the zero mode of quasi-localized 5D fields on the
@xmath -brane but is related to the UV description of the brane. We have
already discussed that the brane-localized SM fields are 4D degrees of
freedom in the EFT. . It is a function @xmath rapidly decreasing over a
distance @xmath and normalized such that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.112)
  -- -------- -- ---------

One can perform a moment expansion of @xmath , where @xmath is an
intermediate function defined for convenience, such that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.113)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.114)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The action describing the interaction between the spinless graviton and
the SM fields is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (6.115)
  -- -------- -- ---------

One can naively think that the large number of KK-gravitons which do not
couple to the SM fields through the operator ( 6.106 ) will have
non-vanishing couplings to the SM via the higher-dimensional operators.
Then, one expects that @xmath is less suppressed than in Eq. ( 6.109 ).
However, this is not the case. Indeed, by using the equations for the
wave functions ( 6.45 ), one can show that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.116)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Therefore, for @xmath even, again only the tower @xmath contributes,
with an extra suppression factor @xmath . For @xmath odd, the
Neumann-Kirchhoff junction conditions ( 6.41 ) imply that these
operators vanish. We conclude that even when we take into account the
brane width in the UV, the KK-graviton towers are still invisible at the
LHC ( @xmath TeV). The KK-gravitons with @xmath constitute a hidden
sector.

One notices also that this important feature of the @xmath -star
compactification is valid only if the SM fields are localized on the
@xmath -brane. If one localizes them on one of the @xmath -branes
instead, they couple also to the KK-gravitons whose wave functions
vanish at the @xmath -brane. One can easily show that this crucial
difference implies that @xmath is of the same form as in Eq. ( 6.111 ),
as in the case of standard ADD models, and one will be able to constrain
this scenario at the LHC.

###### Ultraviolet Gravitational Objects

Black holes are expected to appear near the cut-off scale @xmath , when
the coupling to 5D gravitons becomes non-perturbative. However, in the
case of the benchmark scenario #2, we saw that the coupling of the
energy-momentum tensor of the SM to the linear superposition of
KK-gravitons is suppressed by @xmath instead of @xmath , so one expects
that the couplings of the brane-localized SM fields to the tower of
KK-gravitons remains perturbative well above @xmath , questioning the
possibility of producing black holes in trans-Planckian collisions of SM
particles. However, once the linear superposition of KK-gravitons with a
trans-Planckian energy leaves the @xmath -brane, where it was
perturbatively produced through SM fields in a trans-Planckian
collision, it will interact with all the KK-gravitons, including those
whose wave functions vanish on the @xmath -brane. This last process is
non-perturbative above @xmath and will produce a black hole. Near this
threshold, the black holes are dominated by quantum corrections, we
speak about Quantum Black Holes (QBHs) [ 450 , 451 , 452 , 453 , 278 ,
279 , 454 , 411 , 455 , 456 , 457 , 458 , 459 , 460 ] which need a
complete theory of quantum gravity to be described. Besides, the
lightest QBH, the Planckion [ 414 , 415 ] , is the last stage of the
evaporation of a semi-classical black hole by Hawking radiation. In some
models, this black hole remnant [ 410 , 411 , 412 , 413 ] is stable and
one can speculate that it can constitute a part of dark matter [ 461 ,
411 , 462 ] . There are also a large number of KK-gravitons below the
TeV scale whose wave functions vanish on the @xmath -brane, where the SM
fields are localized (c.f. Subsection 6.3.2 ): these KK-gravitons
interact only with gravity in the bulk, and constitute a natural hidden
sector which could be populated by black hole evaporation during the
early Universe.

#### 6.6 Toy Model of Small Dirac Neutrino Masses

##### 6.6.1 Zero Mode Approximation

It is known from Refs. [ 37 , 38 , 39 ] that if the left-handed
neutrinos, localized on the SM brane, interact with gauge singlet
neutrinos, propagating in the bulk in the form of an internal torus
@xmath of radius @xmath and large volume @xmath , one can get small
Dirac masses for the neutrinos. With one left-handed neutrino and one
gauge singlet neutrino (without BLKTs), the Dirac mass is [ 38 ] :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.117)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the SM Higgs field VEV, and @xmath is the @xmath D
Yukawa coupling of mass dimension @xmath . Eq. ( 6.117 ) is valid if one
can use the zero mode approximation, i.e. neglect the mixing between the
zero mode and the KK-excitations of the bulk gauge singlet neutrino:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.118)
  -- -------- -- ---------

For a natural value

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.119)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath , one has, with Eq. ( 6.2 ),

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.120)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which is a good order of magnitude for the neutrino masses.

We want to see if it is possible to build such a model for a LED
compactified on the metric graph @xmath . For the compactification on a
star/rose graph, one takes a 4D left-handed neutrino @xmath of mass
dimension 3/2 localized on the @xmath -brane, and a 5D gauge singlet
neutrino @xmath of mass dimension 2 propagating into the bulk. The
action of the model is

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (6.121)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

The free action @xmath is given by Eq. ( 6.68 ), and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.122)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The brane-localized mass term is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.123)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath can be taken real since a phase shift of the Yukawa
coupling can be compensated by a phase shift of the field @xmath . We
have imposed that the leptonic number @xmath is conserved, so @xmath is
a symmetry of the model: in this way, bulk and brane-localized Majorana
mass terms for the neutrino fields are not allowed. We have also assumed
the absence of a bulk Dirac mass term to simplify the discussion. By
adopting a perturbative approach, where @xmath is treated as a
perturbation, one can perform the KK dimensional reduction of Section
6.4 . In the regime where we can use the zero mode approximation, i.e.
when

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.124)
  -- -------- -- ---------

we get a mass term for the zero mode neutrino:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.125)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.126)
  -- -------- -- ---------

For a natural value

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.127)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath , one has, from Eqs. ( 6.92 ), ( 6.117 ) and ( 6.126 ),

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.128)
  -- -------- -- ---------

As @xmath for the benchmark scenario #2, the zero mode approximation is
thus justified.

However, within the perturbative approach, we find that the @xmath
left-handed zero modes in Section 6.4 for the @xmath -rose @xmath do not
get masses from the brane-localized mass term ( 6.123 ). They remain
massless and do not mix with the left-handed neutrino localized on the
@xmath -brane: they are sterile neutrinos which do not participate in
neutrino oscillations. However, they are coupled to gravity and may have
an impact on the cosmological history. As our model requires a large
@xmath , it appears to be ruled out by cosmological constraints which
are sensible to the number of light fermionic degrees of freedom. Even
with a brane-localized reheaton, which does not couple to the modes with
discontinuous wave functions like the @xmath left-handed zero modes,
mini-black hole evaporation should produce them in the early Universe. A
solution could be to add a new ingredient to the model to give a mass to
these @xmath zero modes. A priori, our toy model is thus interesting
only for the compactification on a star graph.

##### 6.6.2 Exact Treatment

###### Euler-Lagrange Equations & Junction/Boundary Conditions

In this subsection, we take the effect of the brane-localized mass term
@xmath on the KK mass spectrum exactly into account with the 5D method
of Ref. [ 1 , 409 ] . From Hamilton’s principle applied to the action
@xmath ( 6.121 ), we get the Euler-Lagrange equations: Eq. ( 6.72 ) and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.129)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.130)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We get also a Kirchhoff junction condition for the left-handed field on
the @xmath -brane:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.131)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and Dirichlet boundary conditions ( 6.73 ) for the left-handed field on
the @xmath -branes.

###### Separation of Variables

We want to solve the field equations by separation of variables and sum
over all linearly independant solutions. We thus write the KK
decomposition ( 6.76 ) and expand @xmath as a linear superposition of
the left-handed KK modes which are mass eigenstates:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.132)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath . Indeed, the brane-localized mass term induces a mixing
between the field @xmath and the KK modes of @xmath obtained in Section
6.4 . Here, we expand the fields @xmath and @xmath in the same KK basis
spanned by the @xmath ’s (the basis of the mass eigenstates). The reader
can follow the discussion between Eqs. ( 6.76 ) and ( 6.79 ), we will
use the same notations but we stress that, in Section 6.4 , @xmath is an
element of the KK basis without brane-localized mass term but here it is
an element of the KK basis including the effect of the brane-localized
mass term. Besides, the orthonormalization conditions ( 6.79 ) for the
functions @xmath are replaced by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.133)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The conditions on the 5D fields @xmath become conditions on the KK wave
functions @xmath by using Eq. ( 6.76 ). There is a new Kirchhoff
junction condition on the @xmath -brane from Eq. ( 6.131 ):

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.134)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Moreover, Eq. ( 6.129 ), with Eqs. ( 6.77 ), ( 6.76 ) and ( 6.132 ),
gives:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.135)
  -- -------- -- ---------

For @xmath , Eqs. ( 6.134 ) and ( 6.135 ) together lead to:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.136)
  -- -------- -- ---------

###### Kaluza-Klein Mode Analysis on the Star Graph

We give here only the KK mode analysis of the @xmath -star @xmath ,
since the @xmath -rose @xmath compactification should be incompatible
with cosmology without additional assumptions. For completeness, we give
the KK-mode analysis on @xmath in Appendix B.6 .

There are no zero modes ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ) with @xmath for
@xmath . Let us look at massive KK modes ( @xmath ). The coupled first
order differential equations ( 6.78 ) can be decoupled into second order
ones: Eq. ( 6.82 ). The KK wave functions @xmath are still continuous
across the junction. We will use the same method as in Subsections 6.3.2
and 6.4.2 . We give the results in what follows.

###### First case: @xmath

The results are identical to the ones in Subsection 6.4.2 , Paragraph
“First case: @xmath ” of a) p. 6.4.2 . This condition gives the mass
spectrum ( 6.83 ) which defines the KK tower @xmath . We have @xmath
from Eq. ( 6.135 ) so the left-handed modes do not mix with @xmath :
they are completely sterile, interact only with gravity, and are thus
part of the hidden sector of the model.

###### Second case: @xmath

The KK mass spectrum is given by the transcendental equation:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.137)
  -- -------- -- ---------

whose solutions @xmath define the KK tower @xmath and are not degenerate
( @xmath ). We have @xmath from Eq. ( 6.135 ) so the left-handed modes
mix with @xmath . The lightest mode @xmath is identified with the
neutrino we observe in Nature ⁷ ⁷ 7 Of course, we observe three
generations of neutrinos in Nature and here we consider a toy model with
only one generation. . In the decoupling limit @xmath , the mass of this
mode is given by Eq. ( 6.126 ) in the zero mode approximation. Indeed,
in this limit the excited KK modes decouple and their mixing with the
lightest massive mode @xmath goes to zero. The KK wave functions are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.138)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the @xmath ’s are discontinuous across the @xmath -brane (except
for @xmath , the interval, where they are taken continuous). This
discontinuity is sourced by the brane-localized interaction.

In a nutshell, the massive KK modes have still a mass gap of order
@xmath . Only the KK modes, whose right-handed Weyl spinors have
non-vanishing wave functions at the junction without brane-localized
Yukawa couplings (c.f. Subsection 6.4.2 ), are affected by the addition
of the brane-localized SM left-handed neutrino @xmath and Higgs field.
The KK masses are shifted and the wave functions of the left-handed Weyl
spinors become discontinuous at the junction ⁸ ⁸ 8 In the literature, it
is known that an interaction localized on a brane away from a boundary
or at a fixed point of the orbifolds @xmath and @xmath implies a
discontinuity for a 5D fermion field [ 370 , 50 , 53 , 55 , 58 , 59 , 49
] . . This result is easy to understand when the Yukawa interaction with
the VEV of the Higgs field is treated as a perturbation: only
non-vanishing wave functions at the junction in Subsection 6.4.2 will
have non-vanishing matrix elements. These modes mix with the SM
left-handed neutrino. The other ones are completely sterile and interact
only through gravity.

#### 6.7 Conclusion & Perspectives

In this work, we have studied the possibily of compactifying a large
spacelike extra dimension on a star/rose graph with identical
leaves/petals. In Section 6.2 , we have adapted Kurasov’s distribution
theory to a star/rose graph. In this way, we have defined a rigorous
framework to build a field theory on these geometries.

In Sections 6.3 and 6.4 , we have worked out the KK decomposition of a
Klein-Gordon and Dirac field respectively. Our main contributions,
compared to the previous articles [ 69 , 407 ] , are discussions
concerning the different possibilities for the continuity of the fields
at the junction and the impact on the KK-spectrum. In particular, we
have pointed out the case of an airtight brane (when the off-shell
fields are allowed to be discontinuous), which is equivalent to @xmath
disconnected bonds. Moreover, we have studied for the first time the
KK-modes of a massless 5D Dirac fermion propagating into the whole
star/rose graph. We have also discussed the chirality of the zero modes.
For both bosonic and fermionic massless fields, the KK scale is given by
the inverse of the leaf/petal length/circumference.

One can realize a large compactified volume with a high KK scale for a
large number of small leaves/petals. This possibility has been
investigated in Section 6.5 in order to lower the gravity scale to the
TeV scale and solve the gauge hierarchy problem under the hypothesis of
an exact global @xmath symmetry. Moreover, we have shown that if the SM
fields are localized on the 3-brane at the junction of the star/rose
graph, they couple only to few modes of the whole tower of KK-gravitons,
even when a UV brane thickness is taken into account. The couplings of
the SM fields to this KK tower are suppressed by the large 4D Planck
scale instead of the 5D one at the TeV scale: the KK-gravitons are thus
completely invisible at the LHC ( @xmath TeV). This result is in sharp
contrast to standard ADD models in the literature with compactification
on a torus or its orbifolds, where the SM fields couple to the whole
tower of KK-gravitons, which implies couplings suppressed only by the 5D
Planck scale (near a TeV) which one can constrain at the LHC.

Besides KK-gravitons, our proposition can still be probed at hadronic
colliders through the search for strongly coupled phenomena induced by
gravity like QBHs at the LHC ( @xmath TeV) or semi-classical black holes
at the Future Circular Collider proton-proton (FCC pp, @xmath TeV). The
absence of a theory of Planckian gravity renders difficult to make
precise predictions concerning the production and decay of QBHs or other
exotic states near the Planck scale. It is thus delicate to translate
the LHC data ( @xmath TeV) into constraints on the 5D Planck scale of
our model and to estimate the degree of fine tuning which remains to
accomodate an EW scale at 100 GeV.

Finally, in Section 6.6 we have proposed to realize in our scenario a
toy model of small Dirac neutrino masses. For that purpose, we have
considered only one generation of neutrinos coupled to one gauge singlet
fermion in the bulk. The large compactified volume suppresses the 5D
Yukawa coupling of order unity, and we have been able to reproduce the
good order of magnitude for the mass of the neutrinos, with a model
which accomodates also a 5D Planck scale at the TeV scale. This kind of
model was discussed previously only with a toroidal/orbifold
compactification, and the adaptation to a star/rose graph is new. The
model is realistic only for the compactification on a star graph since
the rose graph predicts a large number of massless left-handed sterile
neutrinos incompatible with cosmology. Moreover, we have found that our
models have a hidden sector consisting in secluded KK-gravitons and
sterile KK-neutrinos possibly populated during the early Universe by the
decays of mini-black holes in the bulk. The Planckion could also be a
candidate to dark matter.

Our effective model (as well as the traditionnal UED models) has a
global @xmath symmetry which acts on the geometry. One of the Swampland
conjectures is the absence of global symmetries in a complete theory of
quantum gravity (see Refs. [ 268 , 269 ] for reviews on the Swampland
program). If true, there is no global @xmath symmetry and one has a
different leaf/petal size @xmath for each @xmath . One can define the
average of the leaf/petal size as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.139)
  -- -------- -- ---------

such that Eq. ( 6.92 ) is still valid but with @xmath . The mass
spectrum must be studied numerically. In general, the mass scale of the
lightest KK-mode is given by the inverse of the largest @xmath . If the
@xmath ’s are incommensurate (i.e. @xmath ), the KK-spectrum is chaotic
[ 463 , 464 , 465 , 466 , 467 , 468 , 350 ] . Moreover, there are more
KK-modes below the cut-off @xmath which couple to the @xmath -brane for
different @xmath ’s: @xmath is thus less suppressed than for identical
@xmath ’s such that one is in an intermediate situation between the
benchmark scenarii #1 and #2. If the @xmath ’s are incommensurate, there
are no KK modes whose wavefunctions vanish at the @xmath -brane and the
KK-spectrum is chaotic.

In a realistic model including gravitationnal effects, instead of an
exact global @xmath symmetry, one should consider a geometry with an
approximate one. In case of GW mechanisms within each leaf, the @xmath
’s would depend on the mass parameter for the GW scalar field within
each leaf. Identical leaf lengths (exact @xmath symmetry) corresponds to
@xmath symmetric mass parameters within all leafs. The question is then
in how far quantum gravity effects affect classically @xmath symmetric
mass parameters. If these modifications remain within @xmath for all
leafs, i.e. the effects of gravity can be considered as a perturbation
of the geometry with an exact @xmath symmetry, the hierarchy problem
could be considered as solved, with the common scale being given by
@xmath . On the other hand, if the modified leaf lengths follow a
statistical distribution (like a Gaussian) around a central value @xmath
, the hierarchy problem can be considered as solved only if this
distribution is extremely narrow such that the number of very light
KK-gravitons remains compatible with present constraints, see subsection
6.5.3 . In the absence of a concrete theory of quantum gravity it is
impossible to answer these questions. Therefore, the toy model of this
article with an exact global @xmath symmetry should not be considered as
a viable solution of the gauge hierarchy problem but as a scenario
within which (among others) a solution of the hierarchy problem may be
possible.

We also want to discuss some perspectives for future investigations. As
a follow-up of the present work, it would be important to study the
unitarity constraints on our models, since a low gravity scale is known
to need a UV completion at a scale lower than the higher-dimensional
Planck scale in standard ADD models with a toroidal compactification [
469 , 470 ] . It is also important to see how the mechanism to produce
small neutrino masses is influenced by adding bulk and brane-localized
Majorana mass terms, in the way of Ref. [ 37 ] . Moreover, strongly
coupled gravity at the TeV scale may generate dangerous brane-localized
higher-dimensional operators inducing proton decay, large Majorana
neutrino masses and Flavor Changing Neutral Currents (FCNCs) [ 35 ] .
Without knowledge of the UV completion, we cannot know if these
operators are naturally suppressed. If this is not the case, the natural
value of their Wilson coefficients are suppressed only by the TeV scale
and one has to add new ingredients to the scenarii to forbid them, like
gauging some global symmetries of the SM as the baryon and lepton
numbers [ 471 ] and other flavor symmetries [ 302 , 303 , 304 ] .

Beyond the motivations for the present work, we stress that the 5D
background geometries that we studied here can be used in general to
generate feebly coupled interactions. Indeed, the couplings of the whole
KK tower of a 5D field, coupled to SM fields localized at the junction
of the star/rose graph, are in general suppressed by the square root of
the compactified volume. One can easily imagine how it can be used to
build consistent models of axions and dark matter with order one 5D
couplings. Moreover, a 5D field has KK modes whose wave functions vanish
at the junction where the SM is localized: they are thus good candidates
for a hidden sector. The star graph compactification with a small number
of leaves can also be used to build models of 5D SM fields as the theory
is chiral at the level of zero modes for 5D fermions. Generating @xmath
fermion zero modes from only one 5D fermion propagating into a star/rose
graph with @xmath leaves/petals and an airtight brane is interesting
from the point of view of flavor physics. Moreover, it would be
interesting to see if one can implement a 5D supersymmetric field theory
or 5D supergravity on the star/rose background. In every scenario, it is
important to investigate different possibilities of field theoretical
mechanism to stabilize the leaf/petal length scale.

### Conclusion

In modern particle physics, the gauge and flavor hierarchies are one of
the main motivations for believing that new mass scales, at which new
degrees of freedom pop up, exist well above the TeV scale. This belief
motivates model building to stabilize the EW scale @xmath GeV against
radiative corrections. The paradigm of spacelike extra dimension offers
the possibility that all these new scales, including the gravity scale,
are in reality in the @xmath TeV range.

In the RS1 model, spacetime is a slice of AdS @xmath and the warp factor
redshifts the scale at which gravity becomes strongly coupled from the
4D Planck scale to the TeV scale on the IR-brane where the SM Higgs
boson is localized. If gauge bosons and fermions propagate into the
bulk, one can address the flavor hierarchy by quasi-localizing the
fermion zero modes along the warped extra dimension. In this picture, it
is important to understand the field theoretical treatment of 5D
fermions coupled to a Higgs field localized on a 3-brane, which is
treated in the literature with an unnecessary and incorrect brane
regularization procedure. This last point is at the heart of the first
part of this PhD thesis. We have shown that it is required to add BBTs
to the action for the 5D fermions in order to be able to employ natural
boundary conditions without overconstraining the system. These terms are
used for both free and interacting 5D fields. When the brane is a
boundary of the extra dimension, all 5D fields are continuous on this
brane and the BBTs must be added by hand from the start. Moreover, only
one of the two chiralities can have boundary localized kinetic and/or
interaction terms. However, when the Higgs field is localized on a brane
away from a boundary, the left or the right-handed field is
discontinuous across the brane. This jump generates BBTs at both sides
of the brane through the 5D kinetic term defined in distribution theory.
In this framework, only the field which is continuous across the brane
is allowed to have brane localized interactions with the Higgs field.
These results can be extended to any kind of brane localized kinetic or
interaction terms involving 5D fermions. They require to reexamine the
phenomenology of warped models with a brane localized Higgs field
coupled to 5D fermion and gauge fields when they were treated by the
brane-Higgs regularization as in previous studies.

In the ADD models, one adds @xmath LEDs compactified on a @xmath D torus
with a factorizable geometry. The large compactified volume dilutes
gravity which appears feebly coupled to an observer localized on a
3-brane. Nevertheless, gravity becomes strongly coupled at the TeV
scale. Within a UV completion in superstring/M-theory, one has @xmath ,
and the gauge hierarchy problem is reformulated as a geometrical
hierarchy problem: the compactification radii need to be stabilized at
large values compared to the @xmath D Planck length, which is difficult
to achieve in practice. In the second part of this PhD thesis, we have
proposed to compactify a single LED on a star/rose graph with a large
number of identical leaves/petals of length/circumference of @xmath ,
where the 5D Planck scale is of @xmath TeV (without a large geometrical
hierarchy to stabilize). The 4D SM fields are localized at the central
vertex of the star/rose graph. We predict a feebly coupled tower of
KK-gravitons invisible in current experiments with a KK scale of @xmath
. Our scenarii lead also to TeV scale strongly coupled gravitational
phenomena and to an infinite tower of trans-TeV semi-classical black
holes. If there is a stable black hole remnant after evaporation, the
Planckion, it could constitute a part of dark matter. Moreover, we
propose a toy model to generate light Dirac neutrinos, where the
right-handed neutrinos are KK modes of gauge singlet fermions
propagating in the extra dimension. In our models, a large number of
KK-gravitons and of sterile KK-neutrinos interact only with gravity and
consititute a dark sector. This part was also the opportunity to clarify
the field theory and KK decomposition of bosons and fermions propagating
into an extra dimension compactified on a metric graph. For that
purpose, we developped a distribution theory on these geometries. If the
brane is not airtight, the bosonic fields are continuous across the
vertices. For the fermions, the left and/or right-handed chirality must
be continuous across the vertices. Only the continuous field can have
brane localized kinetic and/or interaction terms at the vertices, which
generalizes the result of the first part.

Compactification of an extra dimension on metric graphs is an
interesting new area to build new 5D models. The traditional
compactifications on a circle, an interval and their orbifolds are the
smallest building blocks since one can glue them as we want in order to
get any metric graph. It would be interesting to explorate the various
possibilities that such new geometries allow in future works. Having KK
wave functions which vanish at the vertex where SM fields are localized
is a new portal for dark matter. Moreover, the compactification on a
rose graph with @xmath petals allows to have @xmath zero modes for one
chirality of the 5D field, and we have seen that a brane localized mass
term at the vertex gives a mass to the zero mode of opposite chirality.
It is thus tempting to imagine that one can generate the three
generations of SM fermions from only one 5D generation. In this
manuscript, we have sketched a model for small Dirac neutrino masses. It
is important to investigate the possibility of adding Majorana mass
terms and to take into account the mixings among the three generations
of neutrinos.

### Appendix B Supplement Material for 5D Models with Branes

#### b.1 Holography for Fermions

In this appendix, we recall the way of performing Hamilton’s principle
in a holographic context following Ref [ 66 ] , to show the effect of
the bilinear boundary terms. We want to describe a free fermion field
@xmath in a 5D bulk with the extra dimension compactified on an interval
@xmath . Usually, because of the AdS/CFT correspondence, the bulk is a
slice of AdS @xmath , but this is not essential for our discussion, so
we consider a flat extra dimension. The bulk part of the action is
similar to the one in Eq. ( 4.3 ),

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the holographic context, one has to choose a source field which has
to be fixed at one boundary, and allows the remaining degrees of freedom
to vary. One cannot fix simultaneously @xmath and @xmath on the brane at
@xmath because a 5D Lagrangian for a fermion contains only first order
derivatives. Here we choose @xmath as our source field,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

and @xmath is free to vary. Hamilton’s principle for each field leads to

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (B.3)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (B.4)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

@xmath , but @xmath is generic so the boundary variations at @xmath
vanish only if one adds a bilinear boundary term at @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

This bilinear boundary term at @xmath is thus essential to cancel the
brane variations in the holographic context. It is important to notice
that other brane terms (as brane kinetic terms for example) can be
localized at @xmath if they are functions of @xmath only ( @xmath so the
brane variations vanish). In the holographic approach, the value of the
field at @xmath is determined by the equations of motion for @xmath
after the bulk has been integrated out. The choice of @xmath as a source
field is equivalent to a Neumann boundary condition for it (and thus a
Dirichlet boundary condition for @xmath ). Brane localized terms for a
field are hence only consistent with a @xmath boundary condition. In the
same way, if @xmath is chosen as the source field ( @xmath is @xmath and
@xmath is @xmath ), the boundary variations vanish with a brane term as
in Eq. ( B.5 ) but with the opposite sign.

Since in the holographic approach the source fields are chosen at one
boundary so there is no similar motivation to introduce a bilinear
boundary term at @xmath . In the literature, the brane variations at
@xmath vanish by imposing by hand a Dirichlet boundary condition for
@xmath or @xmath at @xmath .

#### b.2 Note on the Continuity of the Fields on a Brane

A priori , a 5D field can be discontinuous across a brane. It is thus
important to investigate whether continuity is required by the
definition of the Lagrangian in order to know if one has to take
continuous or discontinuous variations of the field across the brane
when applying Hamilton’s principle. In order to deal with a
discontinuous field, it is convenient to use distribution theory. One
can associate a regular distributions @xmath to a 5D field ¹ ¹ 1 In
general, a 5D field is a sum of products of 4D fields with wave
functions along the extra dimension. @xmath . There are two cases to
distinguish for the brane position:

1) If the brane is at @xmath away from a boundary of the extra
dimension, the weak partial derivative with respect to @xmath is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the regular distribution associated to the partial
derivative @xmath . We distinguish two cases:

-   @xmath so the discontinuity implies non-vanishing brane localized
    terms proportional to @xmath from Eq. ( B.6 ). When one applies
    Hamilton’s principle, one has to take discontinuous field variations
    allowing for @xmath .

-   @xmath but @xmath so the term proportional to @xmath vanishes in
    Eq. ( B.6 ). One can define a continuous field @xmath such that
    @xmath and @xmath . According to distribution theory [ 373 , 372 ] ,
    @xmath and @xmath are associated to the same distribution @xmath
    since they are equal everywhere except on the hypersurface at @xmath
    . From the point of view of distribution theory, @xmath and @xmath
    belong to the same equivalence class so one can take a field @xmath
    continuous at @xmath from the beginning. In this case, when one
    applies Hamilton’s principle, the variations of the field @xmath are
    taken continous at @xmath too.

2) If the brane is the boundary at @xmath of the extra dimension, the
field @xmath can be discontinuous on this hypersurface: @xmath .
However, if we define the continuous field @xmath such that @xmath and
@xmath , it belongs to the same equivalence class as @xmath from the
point of vue of distribution theory, since the two fields are equal
everywhere except on the boundary at @xmath . As in the second case of
1), the weak partial derivative with respect to @xmath does not have a
singular term at @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

One can take a field @xmath continuous at @xmath as starting point. In
this case, when one applies Hamilton’s principle, the variations of the
field @xmath are taken continuous at @xmath too.

#### b.3 Hamilton’s Principle & Noether Theorem with Distributions

In this Appendix, we want to generalize Hamilton’s principle and
Noether’s theorem with the Lagrangian as a distribution. We have a 5D
field @xmath propagating into an extra dimension compactified on an
interval @xmath . We call @xmath , @xmath and @xmath the Lagrangians in
the bulk, on the boundary at @xmath and on the boundary at @xmath
respectively. The action is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

with the Lagrangian distribution

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , with the Heaviside distribution @xmath .

Hamilton’s principle gives:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (B.10)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

where we have used the fact that the integral of the 4-divergence give a
surface term at the infinity which vanishes. The field variations @xmath
are test functions whose supports are included into @xmath so @xmath ,
and we get the 5D Euler-Lagrange equations with distributions:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

Let the field transform under an infinitesimal global continuous
symmetry:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

If the symmetry is internal, the Lagrangian is invariant:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

so

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (B.14)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

When the Euler-Lagrange equations ( B.11 ) are satisfied, the current

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (B.15)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

is conserved:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

and we recover Noether’s theorem.

#### b.4 Hamilton’s Principle for 5D Fields on an Interval

In this appendix, we formulate the Hamilton’s principle for a field
theory with an extra dimension compactified an interval @xmath . We
consider a set of complex fields @xmath . The bulk Lagrangian is @xmath
. In general, there are boundary localized terms so we add a brane
Lagrangian at @xmath , @xmath , and at @xmath , @xmath . The 5D action
is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Hamilton’s principle applied to @xmath , varying the fields @xmath ,
reads

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
                          
                          
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (B.18)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

In the third equality we use an integration by parts, dropping as usual
the 4-divergence which gives boundary terms at infinity. For generic
field variations, the action variations in the bulk and at the
boundaries vanish separately, giving the bulk Euler-Lagrange equations,

  -- -- -- --------
           (B.19)
  -- -- -- --------

and the brane variations,

  -- -- -- --------
           (B.20)
  -- -- -- --------

  -- -- -- --------
           (B.21)
  -- -- -- --------

On the one hand, if the field values at the boundaries are prescribed by
a constraint, then the brane variations are zero so Eqs. ( B.22 ) and (
B.23 ) are satisfied. On the other hand, for unconstrained fields at the
boundaries, the field variations have to be generic and Eqs. ( B.22 )
and ( B.23 ) imply the so-called natural boundary conditions,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.22)

and

#### b.5 Ultraviolet Brane Thickness

In Ref. [ 441 ] , it is argued that a brane treated as an infinitely
thin hypersurface in an EFT coupled to gravity should have a thickness
in the UV completion. Indeed, if there is a minimal length scale in
Nature as argued in several approaches to quantize gravity, a brane
should have a thickness at least of the order of this minimal length. In
the EFT where the brane is treated as a hypersurface, the brane
thickness in the UV completion can manifest itself by the presence of
higher-dimensional operators such that the brane action is [ 441 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the coefficients @xmath vanish in the limit of an infinite Planck
scale. Ref. [ 441 ] claims that the fields localized on the brane must
be quasi-localized 5D fields (so they must have a @xmath -dependence) in
order to have non-vanishing higher-dimensional operators involving
derivatives of @xmath required by the UV completion. We find that this
argument can be easily circumvented if the Lagrangians @xmath involve
the 5D graviton field which depends on @xmath . Indeed, this is enough
to guarantee that the action of the products @xmath ( @xmath ) on the
test function @xmath are non-vanishing. In this case, the other
brane-localized fields can be 4D fields coupled to the 5D graviton
without any problem to UV complete the EFT with a theory involving a
brane thickness.

#### b.6 Kaluza-Klein Mode Analysis of a Neutrino Model on the Rose
Graph

This appendix refers to the model of Section 6.6 . We give the KK mode
analysis on the @xmath -rose @xmath of the exact treatment of Subsection
6.6.2 .

##### b.6.1 Zero Modes

We are looking for zero modes ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ) with @xmath
for which the first order differential equations ( 6.78 ) are decoupled.
For @xmath , there is no right-handed zero mode. However, we have @xmath
degenerate left-handed zero modes described by the wave functions of
Eq. ( 6.81 ): the theory is chiral at the level of the zero modes.
Therefore, the brane-localized mass term generates chirality in the rose
graph compactification by lifting the degeneracy between the right and
left-handed zero modes which exists in absence of brane-localized Yukawa
couplings (c.f. Subsection 6.4.2 ). Moreover, we have @xmath , which
means that the left-handed zero modes do not mix with the left-handed
neutrino localized on the @xmath -brane: they are sterile neutrinos
which do not participate in neutrino oscillations and they interact only
through gravity. As discussed previously, this scenario with large
@xmath should be ruled out by cosmological constraints on the number of
light fermion species.

##### b.6.2 Massive Modes

###### First case: @xmath

The results are identical to the ones in Subsection 6.4.2 , Paragraph
“First case: @xmath ” of b) p. 6.4.2 . By following this discussion, we
get two different mass spectra ( 6.87 ) and ( 6.89 ) which defines the
KK towers @xmath respectively. We have @xmath from Eq. ( 6.135 ) with
@xmath so the left-handed modes do not mix with @xmath : they are
completely sterile (hidden sector).

###### Second case: @xmath

The KK mass spectrum is given by the transcendental equation:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

whose solutions @xmath define the KK tower @xmath and are not degenerate
( @xmath ). We have @xmath from Eq. ( 6.135 ) so the left-handed modes
mix with @xmath . The lightest massive mode @xmath is identified with
the observed neutrino. In the decoupling limit @xmath , we recover that
the mass of this mode is given by Eq. ( 6.126 ) of the zero mode
approximation. The KK wave functions are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the @xmath ’s have a discontinuity across the @xmath -brane
sourced by the brane-localized interaction.

### Appendix C 4D Method with a Warped Extra Dimension

Unpublished work by Andrei Angelescu.

In this appendix, we calculate the fermionic mass spectrum and the
Yukawa couplings of the model in Section 5.1 by using the so-called 4D
method. The idea of this method is to treat the brane-localized Yukawa
interactions as perturbations. Thus, one solves the free Euler-Lagrange
equations to obtain the free fermionic KK wave functions, and then uses
these KK wave functions to calculate their overlaps with the brane
localized Higgs field, which in turn gives the fermionic mass and Yukawa
matrices in the interaction basis. To pass to the mass or physical
basis, the infinite mass matrix has to be diagonalized, and the Yukawa
matrix rotated to the mass basis. In the following, we describe this
calculation in detail.

The relevant part of the Lagrangian is the effective 4D mass Lagrangian,
given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

By choosing to work in the basis spanned by the 4D spinors @xmath and
@xmath ,

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (C.2)
     @xmath   @xmath      (C.3)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

the mass matrix reads, in block matrix notation, as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

The elements of the block matrices can be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath ¹ ¹ 1 Throughout this section, we will not use the Einstein
summation convention. Sums over indices will always be explicit. go from
@xmath to @xmath , @xmath being the number of KK levels taken into
account (which shall be sent to infinity at the end). @xmath ( @xmath )
represent the free KK masses of the @xmath ( @xmath ) 5D fermion KK
tower. Similarly, @xmath ( @xmath ) are the @xmath free fermion KK wave
functions evaluated on the IR brane and multiplied by a Yukawa coupling.
For the moment, we do not need the explicit expressions of the masses
and KK wave functions. We will specify them later on, when needed.

In order to obtain the 0-mode and KK fermion eigenmasses, one has to
diagonalize either one of the two "squared" mass matrices,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

Given the high (or infinite, when @xmath ) dimensionality, the usual
methods of finding the eigenvalues of @xmath or @xmath , such as
calculating the characteristic polynomial, would be cumbersome, if not
impossible. However, as we show in the following, there is a way of
circumventing this technical difficulty by closely inspecting the
unitary matrices that diagonalize @xmath and @xmath .

We thus consider the two unitary matrices @xmath and @xmath , which
diagonalize @xmath and @xmath respectively:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

At the same time, the two unitary matrices bi-diagonalize the
mass-matrix,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

Using the unitarity of @xmath and @xmath , @xmath , one derives the
following matrix equations:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

which represent the starting point for our calculation of @xmath .

We start by inspecting @xmath . Borrowing the bra-ket notation from
Quantum Mechanics (and slightly abusing it), we write @xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath denoting column vectors. By construction, @xmath are the
eigenvectors of @xmath , with the physical squared masses @xmath as
eigenvalues:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

Similarly to the block decomposition used in Eq. ( C.6 ), we write the
eigenvector @xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore, in block matrix notation, the eigenvector and eigenvalue
equation, Eq. ( C.11 ), becomes:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

The matrix equation above is equivalent to the system of equations

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (C.15)
     @xmath   @xmath      (C.16)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are the unknowns, and @xmath . Solving for the
unknowns, one finds

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we used the notation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

Although the two terms in @xmath diverge when @xmath , it turns out that
their sum, and hence @xmath , are finite, as we shall see below. Before
continuing, we define the following sums:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (C.19)
     @xmath   @xmath      (C.20)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

With the help of the two definitions above, and inserting Eq. ( C.17 )
in Eq. ( C.18 ), we find the following system of equations:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

Clearly, this system admits a solution only if

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

which represents the equation that determines the physical mass
spectrum, i.e. the eigenvalues @xmath . Thus, the matrix elements of
@xmath become:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

Computing the elements of @xmath proceeds in a similar fashion as for
the case of @xmath described above. Writing @xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

and decomposing its columns as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

we repeat the steps taken earlier for @xmath and find the same equation
for the mass spectrum, @xmath . We also find that the elements of @xmath
are given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

Moreover, the relation between @xmath and @xmath can be determined by
using the matrix equation @xmath , and reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

The expression of @xmath can be found through a multitude of ways, such
as enforcing unitarity for @xmath or inserting Eqs. ( C.26 ) and ( C.23
) into Eqs. ( C.7 ) or ( C.8 ). Either way, @xmath is given by the
equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

with

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

The expression of @xmath is important for calculating the mass basis
Yukawa couplings @xmath , which are given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is now clear that, in order to explicitly calculate the eigenmasses,
given by Eq. ( C.22 ), and the Yukawa couplings, given by Eq. ( C.30 ),
we need to evaluate the infinite sums @xmath and @xmath and their first
derivatives, both for @xmath . We detail this procedure in the
following.

To start with, we list the expressions of the free fermionic KK wave
functions, evaluated at @xmath , i.e. on the IR brane:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (C.31)
     @xmath   @xmath      (C.32)
     @xmath   @xmath      (C.33)
     @xmath   @xmath      (C.34)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . For @xmath (zero-mode KK wave functions), which
correspond to @xmath , only the @xmath fields have non-vanishing KK wave
functions, whose values on the IR brane read:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

These KK wave functions listed above are necessary for writing down the
expressions of @xmath and @xmath , which are given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

for all @xmath . In the previous equations, we used several simplifying
notations:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

Because of their similarity, the derivation of both @xmath and @xmath
proceeds along the same lines. Thus, we concentrate on the evaluation of
@xmath , defined in Eq. ( C.20 ), for which we rely on several
mathematical formulas presented in Ref. [ 472 ] , which provide
closed-form expressions for infinite sums involving Bessel functions.
Also, to avoid notation clutter, we write in the following @xmath and
@xmath . Thus, @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . While @xmath is straightforward to compute and reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

@xmath are more challenging, as they involve the calculation of the
normalization constant @xmath . This constant can be obtained by
imposing the normalization condition for @xmath , namely

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

The integral above can be computed with the help of Eq. (4.5) of Ref. [
472 ] , and gives the following value for the normalization constant:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

which in turn allows us to express @xmath in closed form for @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

Inserting Eqs. ( C.39 ) and ( C.42 ) into Eq. ( C.38 ), one can write
@xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

Clearly, the challenge is to evaluate the infinite sum in the equation
above. Fortunately, the infinite sum we are interested in can be
evaluated with the help of Eq. (4.19) from Ref. [ 472 ] . We take a
short break from our computation to briefly explain this equation.

Let @xmath be defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

and let @xmath ² ² 2 Here and in the following @xmath denotes a complex
variable and not the conformal coordinate along the extra dimension. be
a complex function satisfying certain properties listed in Ref. [ 472 ]
(all the cases of @xmath we are considering satisfy these properties).
Denoting as @xmath the poles of @xmath lying complex right half-plane
(including the imaginary axis and thus the origin), Eq. (4.19) from Ref.
[ 472 ] states that:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (C.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

with Res standing for residue. In our case, @xmath are given by the
equation @xmath , which coincides with the condition in Eq. ( C.44 ).
This means that indeed we can use Eq. ( C.45 ) to evaluate the infinite
sum arising in Eq. ( C.43 ). The function @xmath needed for our purpose
is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

whose only pole in the complex right half-plane is at @xmath (for a
given @xmath ), which is a simple pole. Using the expression of @xmath
and the Bessel function identity

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

the sum in Eq. ( C.45 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

Let us denote the function in above equation, whose residues have to be
evaluated, as @xmath . In the right half of the complex plane, @xmath
has a simple pole at @xmath (inherited from @xmath ) and another simple
pole at @xmath . The residue at the origin is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

with the residue at @xmath being

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath and @xmath being the exact KK wave functions obtained in the
so-called 5D approach. Gluing all the pieces together, we find that the
infinite sum from Eq. ( C.43 ) evaluates to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

Inserting the above equality into the expression of @xmath from Eq. (
C.43 ), we note that the contribution from the residue in @xmath exactly
cancels the contribution from the term corresponding to @xmath , leaving
a simple final expression for @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the same techniques as above, one can compute @xmath as well,
whose expression is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

The sign difference between the two sums comes from the negative sign in
front of @xmath , cf Eq. ( C.33 ). With the expressions of the two sums,
Eq. ( C.22 ), which determines the physical mass spectrum, translates to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

which indeed coincides with the mass spectrum ( 5.28 ) obtained in the
5D approach.

Having derived the mass spectrum, we now focus on the calculation of the
4D Yukawa couplings in the so-called "4D approach". In the following, we
work only with the exact KK wave functions, which we write below in a
way that will be convenient later on:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (C.55)
     @xmath   @xmath      (C.56)
     @xmath   @xmath      (C.57)
     @xmath   @xmath      (C.58)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Combining Eqs. ( C.18 ) and ( C.30 ), the expression for the effective
Yukawa couplings becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have use the mass spectrum equation ( C.22 ) for the second
step. In order to obtain the expressions for the Yukawa couplings, one
needs to calculate @xmath , defined in Eq. ( C.29 ):

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (C.60)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Note that in the above equation we took advantage of the logarithmic
derivative from Eq. ( C.29 ) to substitute @xmath by @xmath .

In tackling Eq. ( C.60 ), we first evaluate the part containing the
@xmath -KK wave functions:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the following two relations between Bessel functions,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.62)
     @xmath      (C.63)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath denotes either first ( @xmath ) or second order ( @xmath )
Bessel functions, we find that

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (C.64)
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (C.65)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Using the two equations above, the Bessel function recurrence relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

we obtain from Eq. ( C.61 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.68)
  -- -------- -- --------

Note that, at an intermediate step, we replaced @xmath and @xmath by the
exact KK wave functions, using Eqs. ( C.55 ) - ( C.58 ). We have also
used the simplifying notation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.69)
  -- -------- -- --------

In a similar way, one can obtain the piece containing the @xmath -KK
wave functions from Eq. ( C.60 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.70)
  -- -------- -- --------

Taking another step towards the final expression for @xmath , we make
use of the boundary conditions in @xmath of the exact KK wave functions,
@xmath and @xmath , and insert Eqs. ( C.68 ) and ( C.70 ) in Eq. ( C.60
) to get

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (C.71)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Note that, in the equation above, the quantity which is to be evaluated
between @xmath and @xmath is exactly the same quantity appearing in the
normalization condition for the KK wave functions, as described in the
section dealing with the 5D approach:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.72)
  -- -------- -- --------

With this observation, we arrive at the final expression for @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.73)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have used the definition of @xmath , @xmath . Inserting Eq. (
C.73 ) into Eq. ( C.59 ), and using the expression of @xmath and @xmath
form Eqs. ( C.20 ) and ( C.19 ), together with the boundary conditions
in @xmath , we find that the effective 4D Yukawa couplings are given by
( 5.42 ) which indeed matches the relation derived using the 5D
approach.

#### d.1 Introduction

Le modèle standard de la physique des particules connait un succès
expérimental indéniable. Son secteur électrofaible est basé sur le
mécanisme de brisure spontanée de symétrie de jauge dont la pierre
angulaire est le champ de Higgs. Cependant, le boson de Higgs est traité
dans le modèle standard comme une particule élémentaire de spin 0 qui
n’est pas protégée par une symétrie, donc sa masse est quadratiquement
sensible à toute échelle de nouvelle physique (critère de naturalité
technique de ’t Hooft) et les paramètres de la théorie UltraViolette
(UV) doivent être finement ajustés : c’est le problème de hiérarchie de
jauge. Si une telle nouvelle physique existe au-dessus du TeV, un
mécanisme devrait protéger la masse du Higgs des corrections radiatives
non loin de l’échelle électrofaible. L’existence d’au moins l’échelle de
Planck à @xmath GeV, où la plupart des théoriciens s’attendent à ce que
de nouveaux degrés de liberté apparaissent pour réguler le comportement
de la gravité dans l’UV, rend le problème de hiérarchie de jauge bien
réel.

L’hypothèse, que des dimensions spatiales supplémentaires compactifiées
et des branes existent, permet de construire des modèles où l’échelle de
gravité est ramenée au TeV sur la brane où se trouve le champ de Higgs :
elle agit comme une échelle de coupure sur les corrections radiatives,
et un boson de Higgs léger est naturel. Il existe deux classes de tels
modèles : ADD (Arkani-Hamed - Dimopoulos - Dvali) et RS (Randall -
Sundrum). Les modèles ADD utilisent des dimensions spatiales
supplémentaires compactifiées sur des espaces avec un grand volume, où
les champs du modèle standard sont localisés sur une 3-brane, et où la
gravité est diluée par le grand volume et apparaît faiblement couplée
sur la brane. En revanche, elle devient fortement couplée au TeV. Pour
un petit nombre de dimensions supplémentaires compactifiées sur un tore,
les rayons de compactification sont grands devant la longueur de Planck
dans le bulk. Cette nouvelle hiérarchie géométrique est en général
difficile à stabiliser dans un modèle réaliste. Quant au modèle RS, il
nécessite une seule dimension supplémentaire courbe compactifiée sur un
intervalle (ou de manière équivalente l’orbifold @xmath ). La courbure
entraine que les échelles de gravité aux deux bords de l’intervalle
soient exponentiellement séparées : l’une est à @xmath GeV, et
correspond à l’échelle de Planck 4D de la relativité générale, et
l’autre est au TeV. Si le boson de Higgs est localisé sur une 3-brane au
bord où l’échelle de gravité est au TeV, il n’y a plus de problème de
hiérarchie de jauge. Les bosons de jauge et les fermions du modèle
standard sont libres de se propager dans le bulk. Si les fermions ont
des masses de Dirac 5D différentes, il est possible de localiser
différemment les modes zéro le long de la dimension supplémentaire, et
on peut reproduire la hiérarchie de masse des fermions du modèle
standard : la fonction d’onde d’un fermion léger (lourd) aura un petit
(grand) recouvrement avec la brane où est localisé le champ de Higgs. Il
est alors crucial de comprendre comment traiter en théorie des champs
l’interaction de fermions 5D avec un champ de Higgs branaire.

#### d.2 Au-delà de la régularisation du champ de Higgs branaire

Au Chapitre 4 , on étudie un modèle jouet avec une dimension spatiale
supplémentaire compactifiée sur un intervalle. Deux champs de Dirac 5D
sont couplés à un scalaire localisé sur une 3-brane à un bord de
l’intervalle. Le champ scalaire acquiert une valeur moyenne dans le
vide, ce qui donne une masse localisée aux fermions. Ce modèle jouet est
ainsi inspiré du modèle de génération des masses des fermions dans le
modèle RS, avec les bosons de jauge et les fermions du modèle standard
dans le bulk.

On réexamine tout d’abord le cas d’un fermion 5D libre. Si on applique
naïvement le principe de Hamilton sur l’action du bulk, et que l’on
prend des conditions aux bords naturelles, on obtient des solutions pour
les champs nulles partout : le système est sur-contraint aux bords. Pour
avoir des solutions physiques, il faut imposer des conditions aux bords
essentielles de Dirichlet, compatibles avec l’annulation sur les bords
de la composante transverse du courant de Dirac conservé. Une autre
possibilité est d’ajouter des termes de bord qui sont des termes de
masse avec un coefficient fixé à @xmath , analogues aux termes de
Gibbons-Hawking en gravité. Ces termes de bord vont compenser la
variation sur le bord de l’une des deux chiralités du champ 5D, évitant
ainsi au système d’être sur-contraint.

Ensuite, on critique la procédure de régularisation du champ de Higgs
branaire de la littérature qui est en fait inutile et qui manque de
rigueur mathématique. Deux types de régularisations sont proposés dans
la littérature : déplacer la brane sur laquelle est localisé le champ de
Higgs dans le bulk ou lui donner une épaisseur. Dans les deux cas, les
auteurs incluent des termes de masse localisés qui impliquent le produit
d’une distribution de Dirac avec des champs discontinus en ce point, ce
qui n’est pas défini en théorie des distributions.

On propose alors une méthode 5D où les termes de masse localisés sont
pris en compte dans les conditions aux bords en résolvant les équations
différentielles donnant les fonctions d’onde dans le bulk de chaque mode
de Kaluza-Klein. Les termes de bord optionnels dans le cas libre sont
alors essentiels pour obtenir des solutions physiques viables. Le
principe de Hamilton entraîne que certains termes de masse localisés sur
les bords doivent être nuls pour ne pas que le système soit
sur-contraint : les termes de masse localisés ne peuvent faire
intervenir que l’une des deux chiralités des champs 5D. Le spectre de
masse est alors identique à celui de la méthode dite 4D, où on résout
d’abord le spectre de Kaluza-Klein libre, et où on inclut les termes de
masse localisés comme une matrice infinie à bi-diagonaliser. Dans cette
méthode, les opérateurs localisés, qui doivent être nuls dans la méthode
5D, ne contribuent pas car ils impliquent les champs libres qui
s’annulent sur les bords.

#### d.3 Généralisations

Au Chapitre 5 , on présente diverses applications et extensions de notre
méthode 5D pour des fermions avec des termes branaires.

Tout d’abord, on reprend le modèle du Chapitre 4 mais avec une dimension
spatiale supplémentaire courbe. On prend l’exemple d’une tranche AdS
@xmath . Ceci ne change pas le traitement des conditions aux bords de
l’intervalle et les conclusions sont similaires à celles dans le cas
d’une dimension plate.

On s’intéresse ensuite à différents termes localisés sur un bord que
l’on peut rencontrer dans la littérature sur les fermions 5D : termes
cinétiques branaires, masse de Majorana branaire, mélange avec un
fermion branaire. On se limite à une dimension spatiale supplémentaire
plate et on calcule le spectre de masse. À chaque fois, on montre qu’il
est nécessaire d’inclure les termes de bord, discutés plus haut, pour
avoir des solutions consistantes où le système n’est pas sur-contraint
(relations entre les paramètres indépendants du modèle).

On étudie également le modèle du Chapitre 4 avec les orbifolds @xmath et
@xmath . Les champs de chiralités opposées, provenant d’un même champ
5D, ont une parité différente sous les symétries @xmath et @xmath . On
définit la théorie des champs sur les espaces de recouvrement : les
branes ne sont alors plus sur les bords de l’espace. Les termes de masse
induisent des discontinuités à travers les branes pour les champs
impairs. Comme pour l’intervalle, le principe de Hamilton implique que
les termes de masse branaires pour les champs impairs doivent être nuls.
Quand les champs sont définis au sens des distributions, on peut passer
au formalisme des fonctions, et les champs discontinus génèrent ainsi
des termes de bord identiques à ceux que l’on doit ajouter ab initio
dans le cas de l’intervalle. Le spectre de masse est identique à celui
du modèle avec un intervalle (à un facteur 2 près qui peut être éliminé
par une redéfinition du couplage de Yukawa 5D). Ces modèles sont donc
duaux.

Pour terminer, on reprend le modèle du Chapitre 4 où on a déplacé la
brane sur laquelle est localisé le champ de Higgs dans le bulk. Les
termes de masse impliquent que certains champs sont discontinus à
travers la brane. La forme des termes cinétiques impose que l’une des
deux chiralités d’un champ 5D doit être continue. De la même manière que
pour les orbifolds, des termes de bord sur la brane sont générés par la
dérivée au sens des distributions des champs discontinus.

#### d.4 Grande dimension supplémentaire en étoile/rose avec de
petit(e)s branches/pétales

Au Chapitre 6 , on propose un type de modèle ADD qui ne souffre pas
d’une grande hiérarchie géométrique à stabiliser. L’idée est de
compactifier une dimension spatiale supplémentaire sur un graphe
étoile/rose avec un grand nombre @xmath de petit(e)s branches/pétales
identiques. Avec une échelle de Planck 5D @xmath TeV et une
longueur/circonférence des branches/pétales @xmath GeV, on obtient
@xmath . @xmath est fixé par la géométrie, il est donc conservé et
stable sous les corrections radiatives dans la théorie effective.
L’origine de la grande valeur de @xmath se trouve dans la théorie UV de
la gravité où on s’attend à ce que @xmath soit déterminé dynamiquement.

On étudie la décomposition de Kaluza-Klein d’un champ 5D scalaire réel
massif et d’un champ 5D de Dirac sans masse. Certains modes de
Kaluza-Klein ont leurs fonctions d’onde (celles qui sont continues) qui
s’annulent à la jonction de l’étoile/rose. On trouve que l’échelle de
Kaluza-Klein est donnée par @xmath . Pour un champ scalaire, il n’y a
qu’un seul mode zéro. Pour un champ de Dirac sur l’étoile, il n’y a un
mode zéro que pour le champ chiral continu à travers la jonction. Sur la
rose, le champ chiral continu n’a qu’un seul mode zéro alors que le
champ de chiralité opposée, qui peut être discontinu, en a @xmath . On
peut ainsi générer @xmath générations au niveau des modes zéro à partir
d’une seule génération de champ 5D.

En supposant les champs du modèle standard localisés sur une 3-brane à
la jonction de l’étoile/rose, on montre avec un modèle jouet de graviton
5D sans spin que les couplages de la tour de KK-gravitons au modèle
standard sont très supprimés comparés aux modèles ADD avec une
compactification toroïdale, car seul le petit nombre de KK-gravitons,
dont la fonction d’onde ne s’annule pas à la jonction, couple au modèle
standard. Les KK-gravitons, qui ne couplent pas au modèle standard,
constituent un secteur caché. On s’attend donc seulement à observer des
phénomènes de gravité quantique fortement couplés aux LHC à 14 TeV. Un
FCC-pp à 100 TeV permettrait d’observer la base de la tour de trous
noirs semi-classiques trans-planckiens. Un trou noir quantique au TeV,
le Planckion, est peut-être stable et constituerait ainsi une partie de
la matière noire.

Pour terminer, on étudie également un modèle jouet où une génération de
neutrino gauche est localisée à la jonction d’une étoile/rose, et est
couplée via le champ de Higgs à un neutrino 5D singulet de jauge. La
masse de Dirac du mode le plus léger est supprimée par la racine carrée
du volume du graphe, ce qui permet de générer le bon ordre de grandeur
pour la masse des neutrinos observés tout en ayant l’échelle de gravité
au TeV. Seul le graphe étoile est phénoménologiquement viable car, sur
la rose, on a @xmath neutrinos gauches stériles sans masse couplés
seulement à la gravité qui posent un problème pour la cosmologie du
modèle. Une partie des KK-neutrinos sont stériles et constituent un
secteur caché.

#### d.5 Perspectives

On a vu que certains opérateurs localisés doivent être nuls pour obtenir
des solutions physiquement intéressantes. On sait néanmoins que les
corrections radiatives génèrent des opérateurs localisés sur les branes.
En traitant les termes localisés comme des perturbations des solutions
libres, on voit que les opérateurs qui doivent être nuls à l’arbre ne
sont pas générés radiativement. Il paraît intéressant de vérifier cela
avec les solutions exactes.

Dans la littérature sur les modèles à 5D, la dimension spatiale
supplémentaire est généralement compactifiée sur un cercle ou un
intervalle (ainsi que sur les orbifolds équivalents). Quelques auteurs
ont généralisé la compactification à des graphes métriques. Le cercle et
l’intervalle sont alors vus comme les briques élémentaires que l’on
assemble pour obtenir n’importe quel graphe.

Il serait intéressant d’utiliser les propriétés géométriques des graphes
pour construire des modèles de matière noire où une KK-particule est
stable. Les exemples de l’étoile/rose, avec un grand nombre de
branches/pétales, permettent d’avoir des KK-particules très faiblement
couplées, ce qui est intéressant pour les modèles de matière noire,
d’axions, de neutrinos, etc.

On a vu également comment générer @xmath modes zéro pour un champ de
Dirac 5D sur une rose, et comment donner une masse au mode zéro miroir
en localisant une interaction sur le vertex. Il serait alors intéressant
de construire un modèle de saveur où les trois générations de fermions
du modèle standard sont les modes zéro d’une seule génération de
fermions 5D se propageant sur une rose à trois pétales. On pourrait
aussi rechercher d’autres graphes métriques qui ont la propriété de
générer plusieurs modes zéro fermioniques.

Pour terminer, il serait intéressant d’étudier aussi la construction de
théorie des champs 5D supersymétriques sur des graphes métriques.
