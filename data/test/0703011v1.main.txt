## Introduction

An important test of the standard model (SM) of particle physics [ 1 ]
is to measure and understand the properties of the highest
momentum-transfer particle collisions, which correspond to measurements
at the shortest distances. The predicted high energy behavior of the SM,
however, becomes unphysical at an interaction energy on the order of
several TeV. These phenomena beyond the SM may involve new elementary
particles, new fundamental forces, and/or a modification of space-time
geometry. These new phenomena are likely to show up as an anomalous
production rate of a combination of the known fundamental particles.

The unknown nature of possible new phenomena in the energy range
accessible at the Tevatron is the motivation for a search strategy that
does not focus on a single model of new physics, but presents a wide net
for new phenomena. We compared SM predictions with the rates measured at
the Tevatron with the CDF detector for final states with at least one
high-PT lepton (e or @xmath ) and photon ( @xmath ), plus other detected
objects (leptons, photons, jets, and missing transverse energy, ). A
priori definition of selection cuts for the search allows to test Run I
anomalies, such as the observation of an event consistent with the
production of two energetic photons, two energetic electrons, and large
(the “ @xmath event”), in Run II data. Another intriguing Run I result
that is important to test is a 2.7 @xmath excess above the Standard
Model expectations in the @xmath signature [ 2 , 3 ] .

The Fermilab Tevatron has the highest center-of-mass energy collisions
(per nucleon) of any accelerator to date, and thus has the potential to
discover new physics. The upgraded CDF II detector provides us better
solid angle coverage and particle identification. The production of two
vector gauge bosons, precisely predicted in the Standard Model, provides
a set of signatures in which to search for the production of new
particles which couple to the SM gauge sector (the top quark being the
last new example).

This analysis has been done with 305 @xmath of @xmath collisions at
@xmath = 1.96 @xmath , collected with CDF detector at the Tevatron,
Fermilab between March 23, 2002 and August 22, 2004. The main results of
this thesis have been published in [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] . Standard Model @xmath
and @xmath production CDF Run II results are published in [ 7 ] . The
status of the Lepton+Photon+X search has been presented at the APS
Conference (Philadelphia, 2003). The results have been presented at the
SUSY 2005 conference (Durham, 2005) [ 8 ] , the International School of
Subnuclear Physics (Erice, 2005) [ 5 ] , Lake Louise Winter Institute
(2006) [ 9 ] , and also at the CDF Collaboration Meeting (Sitges, 2005)
and at the Exotics, Photon and Very Exotic Phenomena working group
meetings.

At the International School of Subnuclear Physics (Erice, 2005) I
havereceived the “New Talents” Award for an Original Work in
Experimental Physics for the talk “Search for New Physics in Photon
Final states”. The work has been reviewed and approved for publication
in [ 4 , 5 ] by G. t’Hooft, 1999 Nobel Laureate in Physics.

One of the most important tools for a better understanding of the events
that could possibly be New Physics candidates is a CDF Run II Event
Display visualization package [ 10 , 11 ] , which is widely used for
offline analysis as well as to monitor online data taking [ 12 ] .
Development and Support of the EventDisplay package is a responsibility
of ITEP (Moscow) group at CDF. I am the project leader [ 13 ] and
responsible for this task.

The thesis consists of an introduction, 13 chapters, and conclusions.
Chapter 1 presents the motivation for the analysis, and gives an
introduction to the Run I results and Signature-Based searches. Chapter
2 gives a description of the CDF experiment at the Tevatron Collider. We
describe the CDF coordinate system, and give information about the
tracking, calorimetry, muon and luminosity systems. We introduce the
trigger and data acquisition systems.

Chapter 3 presents a detailed description of the CDF Run II Event
Display (EVD) package and related projects. The EVD is used for online
monitoring, offline analysis and for public relation (PR) purposes.

Chapter 4 presents the inclusive high- @xmath electron, muon, and photon
datasets from which we select @xmath candidates, as well as the time
intervals of data-taking, used to test the stability of the event yields
(Section 4.1 ). It also presents an overview of the kinematic selection
criteria for the @xmath events (Section 4.2 ).

The identification criteria for objects and control samples for muon
candidates are described in detail in Chapter 5 , for electron
candidates in Chapter 6 , and for photon candidates in Chapter 7 .
Chapter 8 describes how missing transverse energy ( ) is calculated, and
gives the definition and describes calculation of the total transverse
energy ( @xmath ).

Chapter 9 presents the Standard Model expectations from SM physics
processes that give the lepton-photon signature. The primary ones are
production of @xmath , @xmath ; we include estimates from the two-photon
(3-boson) processes @xmath and @xmath . For each of these predictions we
have used at least 2 independent Monte Carlo generators. Backgrounds
from SM processes with a ‘fake’ (misidentified other object, such as a
jet) photon or lepton are described in Chapter 10 . Chapter 11 gives an
overview of the experimental, theoretical and luminosity systematic
uncertainties.

Chapter 12 presents the topologies of the signatures we are looking for,
and gives the number of events observed. Section 12.4 gives the
comparison of the observed event counts with expectations from the sum
of SM physics processes and background. In conclusion we summarize the
results and present future prospects.

Appendix A presents lists of Lepton-Photon- and Multi-Lepton-Photon
events (Section A.1 ) and additional plots for @xmath and @xmath
signatures (Sections A.2 and A.3 ). It also presents the stability of
the event yields for W+jets and Z+jets (Section A.4 ), distributions of
the isolation variables for different muon types (Section A.5 ).
Finally, it presents supplementary information about conversion
electrons (Section A.6 ) and additional checks for non-Z backgrounds for
the @xmath signature (Section A.7 ).

## Chapter 1 Motivation

The goal of elementary particle physics is to find the ultimate
constituents of matter and to study the fundamental interactions that
occur among them. To address these questions we need to perform
measurements at the shortest distances, and therefore to study the
properties of the highest momentum-transfer particle collisions.
Particle physics seeks a classification of the elementary particles and
a consistent theoretical description of their interactions that leads to
an accurate description of experimental observables.

### 1.1 Standard Model, Supersymmetry, or Something Else?

The Standard Model (SM) is an effective field theory [ 1 ] that has so
far described the fundamental interactions of elementary particles
remarkably well. All of the data from collider experiments, are
explained and (in principle) are calculable in the framework of the SM.
However, the SM does not include gravity and is expected to be an
effective low-energy field theory [ 14 ] . The SM contains no dark
matter candidate(s). The SM higgs boson mass receives quadratically
divergent loop corrections. This results in the well-known hierarchy
problem [ 15 ] of the SM.

The different approaches to solving the hierarchy problem include
eliminating the Higgs scalar entirely from the theory (Technicolor [ 16
] ), lowering the cutoff scale (large extra dimensions [ 17 ] ), or
embedding the Higgs field in a multiplet of a symmetry group larger than
the 4D Poincare group (supersymmetry [ 18 , 19 ] ).

The existence of supersymmetry (SUSY) would provide solutions to the
fine tuning problem [ 20 ] , and possibly the hierarchy problem, which
we currently encounter in the SM. The experimental signatures of
supersymmetry are complex, as all known fermions of the SM have bosons
as supersymmetric partners while all bosons acquire fermions as
superpartners. Due to the large number of free parameters, it is
necessary to make further assumptions in the context of specific SUSY
models [ 21 ] for specific searches.

Part of the SM unified ”electroweak” theory of the electromagnetic and
weak forces is based on the exchange of four particles: the photon for
electromagnetic interactions, and two charged W particles and a neutral
Z particle for weak interactions. These particles, @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath , are fundamental in the SM.

In searching for new particles/quantum numbers, the signature of pairs
of gauge bosons ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ) is
natural if pairs of particles with a conserved quantum number are
produced because of flavor conservation in QCD. @xmath and @xmath SM
physics processes lead to inclusive production of events with a
high-energy lepton and a high-energy photon.

### 1.2 The Lepton-Photon Events

Besides the specific theoretical models, searching for new physics with
photons has several advantages. For example, the photon is one of the
three SU(2) x U(1) gauge bosons and as such is likely to be a good probe
of new interactions since it might couple to any new gauge sector.
Final-state photons have additional distinct detection advantages over
@xmath or @xmath bosons since they do not decay. Thus they do not suffer
a sensitivity loss from branching ratios and momentum sharing between
the decay products. The photon is coupled to electric charge, and thus
is radiated by all charged particles, including the incoming states,
which is important for searching for invisible final states. The photon
is a boson and could be produced by a fermiphobic parent. For the search
we also require a lepton: the events containing high- @xmath photon and
high- @xmath lepton, @xmath , are rare in the SM, and therefore
backgrounds are low.

There are many models [ 22 ] of new physics that could produce @xmath
events. Gauge-mediated models of supersymmetry [ 23 ] , in which the
lightest super-partner (LSP) is a light gravitino, provide a model in
which each partner of a pair of supersymmetric particles produced in a
@xmath interaction decays in a chain that leads to a produced gravitino,
visible as . If the next-to-lightest neutralino (NLSP) has a photino
component, each chain also can result in a photon. Models of
supersymmetry in which the symmetry breaking is due to gravity also can
produce decay chains with photons [ 24 ] . For example, if the NLSP is
largely photino-like, and the lightest is largely higgsino, decays of
the former to the latter will involve the emission of a photon [ 25 ] .
More generally, pair-production of selectrons or gauginos can result in
final-states with large , two photons and two leptons and lead to events
like the Run I @xmath candidate event (Section 1.4 ).

For example, an initial model invoked low-energy supersymmetry with a
neutralino LSP as a possible interpretation of the CDF Run I @xmath
event [ 26 ] via the process:

@xmath , @xmath , @xmath

where @xmath is the selectron (the bosonic partner of the electron), and
and are the lightest and next-to-lightest neutralinos, the fermionic
partners of the neutral bosonic states formed by mixing the fermionic
partners @xmath , the @xmath , and the neutral Higgses into mass
eigenstates.

Gauge-mediated models in which a photino decays into a gravitino are
also popular choices [ 24 ] , and have the appealing feature that they
have a natural dark matter candidate.

Further expanding the space of parameters, a more recent SUSY
interpretation of the CDF @xmath events [ 19 ] is resonant smuon @xmath
production with a single dominant R-parity violating coupling(Figure 1.1
).

The current interest in models of extra dimensions [ 17 ] , which can
produce events of interest to the @xmath search, is a good example of an
innovation that was searched for before it was conceived. These models
predict excited states of the known standard model particles. The
production of a pair of excited electrons [ 27 ] would provide a natural
source for two photons and two electrons (although not unless the pair
were produced with some other, undetected, particle.). As in the case of
supersymmetry, there are many parameters in such models, with a
resulting broad range of possible topologies with multiple gauge bosons.

However the parameter space of SUSY models is so large, and there are so
many other models beyond SUSY, including ones that have not yet been
thought of, that we have adopted the strategy of testing the SM
predictions in promising signatures. This strategy, the Signature-Based
Search , is nothing more than testing the SM [ 1 ] .

### 1.3 Signature-Based Searches

While it is good to be guided by theory, one should also remain open to
the unexpected. Therefore we use a quasi-model-independent
Signature-Based Searches technique, and look for significant deviations
from the SM [ 28 , 29 , 30 ] . In the Run I dataset, no significant
evidence for new physics was found, but there were some hints that the
SM may be incomplete (Section 1.4 ). CDF has preferred to highlight some
potential anomalies as worth pursuing in Run II, thus setting up
selection criteria in a priori fashion.

We perform the search by systematically looking at events by their final
state particles. The strategy for the Signature-Based Search is to test
the SM by looking for an excess over the SM prediction. The challenge
also extends to the theoretical community - to look for something new we
will need to understand the non-new, i.e. the SM predictions, at an
unprecedented level of precision. Some amount of this can be done with
control samples - it is always best to use data rather than Monte Carlo,
but this is not always possible.

### 1.4 Run I Results and Present Analysis

#### 1.4.1 The @xmath Candidate Event

In 1995 the CDF experiment, measuring @xmath collisions at a
center-of-mass energy of 1.8 TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron, using 85
@xmath of data, observed an event consistent with the production of two
energetic photons, two energetic electrons, and large missing transverse
energy [ 31 , 32 , 28 ] (Figure 1.2 ).

This signature is predicted to be very rare in the Standard Model of
particle physics, with the dominant contribution being from the WW
@xmath production: @xmath , from which we expect 8 @xmath 10 @xmath
events. All other sources (mostly due to detector misidentification)
lead to 5 @xmath events. Therefore, we expect (1 @xmath 1) @xmath 10
@xmath events, which would give us one @xmath candidate event if we have
taken one million times more data than we actually had in Run I.

The event raised theoretical interest, however, as the two-lepton
two-photon signature is expected in some models of physics ‘beyond the
Standard Model’ [ 1 ] such as gauge-mediated models of supersymmetry [
19 , 25 ] .

#### 1.4.2 @xmath+X Search

The detection of this single event led to the development of
‘signature-based’ inclusive searches in Run I to cast a wider net: in
this case one searches for two photons + X [ 31 , 32 , 28 ] , where X
stands for anything, with the idea that if pairs of new particles were
being created these inclusive signatures would be sensitive to a range
of decay modes or the creation and decay of different particle types.

In Run I Searches for @xmath +X , all results were consistent with the
SM background expectations with no other exceptions other than
observation of @xmath candidate event(Table 1.1 ) [ 32 ] .

#### 1.4.3 From @xmath to @xmath: @xmath Search

Another ‘signature-based’ inclusive search, motivated by @xmath event
was for one photon plus one lepton + X [ 2 , 3 , 29 ] . In general data
agrees with expectations, with the exception for the @xmath category. We
have observed 16 @xmath events on a background of 7.6 @xmath 0.7
expected. The 16 @xmath events consist of 11 @xmath events and 5 @xmath
events, versus expectations of 4.2 @xmath 0.5 and 3.4 @xmath 0.3 events,
respectively. The SM prediction yields the observed rate of @xmath with
0.7% probability (which is equivalent to 2.7 standard deviations for a
Gaussian distribution). One of the first SUSY interpretation of the CDF
@xmath events [ 19 ] was resonant smuon @xmath production with a single
dominant R-parity violating coupling(Figure 1.1 ).

The Run I search was initiated by an anomaly in the data itself, and as
such the 2.7 sigma excess above the SM expectations must be viewed
taking into account the number of such channels that a fluctuation could
have occurred in. The Run I paper concluded: “However, an excess of
events with 0.7% likelihood (equivalent to 2.7 standard deviations for a
Gaussian distribution) in one subsample among the five studied is an
interesting result, but it is not a compelling observation of new
physics. We look forward to more data in the upcoming run of the
Fermilab Tevatron.” [ 3 ] .

## Chapter 2 The CDF Experiment at the Tevatron Collider

An important part of the study of elementary particle physics is to
understand experimental tools - the accelerators, beams and detectors by
means of which particles are accelerated, their trajectories controlled
and their collisions studied.

The Tevatron is currently the world’s highest energy particle
accelerator. Protons(p) and anti-protons ( @xmath ) are accelerated to
be brought into collision with a center of mass energy of 1.96 TeV. Two
detectors are situated at the B @xmath and D @xmath collision points,
the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) and D @xmath .

### 2.1 The Tevatron

Fermilab uses a series of accelerators to create the world’s most
energetic particle beams. The diagram in Figure 2.1 shows the paths
taken by p and @xmath from initial acceleration to collision in the
Tevatron. In the first stage of acceleration H @xmath ions are created
from the ionization of the hydrogen gas and accelerated to a kinetic
energy of 750 KeV in the Cockcroft-Walton pre-accelerator [ 33 ] . The H
@xmath ions enter a linear accelerator (Linac) [ 34 ] , where they are
accelerated to 400 MeV. The acceleration in the Linac is done by a
series of “kicks” from Radio Frequency (RF) cavities. The oscillating
electric field of the RF cavities groups the ions into bunches. Before
entering the next stage, a carbon foil removes the electrons from the H
@xmath ions at injection, leaving only the protons. The 400 MeV protons
are then injected into the circular synchrotron (“Booster”). The protons
travel around the Booster to a final energy of 8 GeV.

Protons are then extracted from the Booster into the Main Injector [ 35
] , where they are accelerated from 8 GeV to 150 GeV before the
injection into the Tevatron. The Main Injector also produces 120 GeV
protons. These protons are extracted and collide with a nickel target,
producing a wide spectrum of secondary particles, including @xmath . In
the collisions, about 20 @xmath are produced per one million protons.
The @xmath are collected, focused, and then stored in the Accumulator
ring. Once a sufficient number of @xmath are collected, they are sent to
the Main Injector and accelerated to 150 GeV.

Finally, both the p and @xmath are injected into the Tevatron. The
Tevatron, the last stage of Fermilab’s accelerator chain, receives
150 GeV p and @xmath from the Main Injector and accelerates them to
980 GeV. The p and @xmath travel around the Tevatron in opposite
directions. The beams are brought to collision at the center of the two
detectors, CDF II and D @xmath II (see Figure 2.1 ).

### 2.2 The CDF Detector

A discovery will rely heavily on a thorough understanding of the
detector. Two aspects are critical: the identification of objects that
make up each signature, and the understanding of the calibration and
resolution of the detector. The objects for which we have a good
understanding of the efficiencies and fake-rates are those for which
tracking is essential: electrons, muons, and photons (i.e. a high
confidence of the absence of a track), all in the central region.
Similarly, the energy scale and resolutions of the calorimeters are well
understood in the central region, where the magnetic spectrometer is
used to calibrate the calorimeters.

The CDF II detector is a cylindrically-symmetric spectrometer designed
to study @xmath collisions at the Fermilab Tevatron based on the same
solenoidal magnet and central calorimeters as the CDF I detector [ 36 ]
. A cross-section of one half of the detector is shown in Figure 2.2 .

Because the analysis described here is intended to repeat the Run I
search as closely as possible, we note especially the differences from
the CDF I detector relevant to the detection of leptons, photons, and .
The tracking systems (Section 2.2.2 ) used to measure the momenta of
charged particles have been replaced with a central outer tracker (COT)
that has smaller drift cells [ 37 ] , and an enhanced system of silicon
microstrip detectors [ 38 ] . The calorimeters in the regions (Section
2.2.1 ) with pseudorapidity @xmath have been replaced with a more
compact scintillator-based design, retaining the projective geometry
(Section 2.2.3 ). The coverage in @xmath of the central upgrade muon
detector (CMP) and central extension muon detector (CMX) systems
(Section 2.2.4 ) has been extended; the central muon detector (CMU)
system is unchanged.

The main upgrades to the CDF detector from Run I to Run II, relevant to
the analysis, can be summarized as follows:

-   Fully digital DAQ system designed for 132 ns bunch crossing times

-   Significantly upgraded silicon detector:

    – 707,000 channels compared with 46,000 in Run I

    – Axial, stereo, and 90 @xmath strip readout

    – Full coverage over the luminous region along the beam axis

    – Radial coverage from 1.35 to 28 cm for @xmath

    – Innermost silicon layer(“L00”) on the beampipe with 6 @xmath m
    axial hit resolution

-   Outer drift chamber capable of 132 ns maximum drift

    – 30,240 sense wires, 44-132 cm radius, 96 d @xmath /d @xmath
    samples possible per track

-   Fast scintillator-based calorimetry out to @xmath

-   Expanded muon coverage

-   Improved trigger capabilities

    – Drift chamber tracks with high precision at Level-1

    – Silicon tracks for detached vertex triggers at Level-2

-   Expanded particle identification via time-of-flight and d @xmath /d
    @xmath

#### 2.2.1 CDF Coordinate System

The CDF detector uses a right-handed coordinate system. The horizontal
direction pointing out of the ring of the Tevatron is the positive
@xmath -axis. The vertical direction pointing upwards is the positive
@xmath -axis. The proton beam direction, pointing to the east, is the
positive @xmath -axis.

A spherical coordinate system is also used. The radius @xmath is
measured from the center of the beamline. The polar angle @xmath is
taken from the positive @xmath -axis. The azimuthal angle @xmath is
taken counter-clockwise from the positive @xmath -axis.

At a @xmath collider, the production of any process starts from a
parton-parton interaction which has an unknown boost along the @xmath
-axis, but no significant momentum in the plane perpendicular to the
@xmath -axis, i.e. the transverse plane. This makes the transverse plane
an important plane in a @xmath collision. Momentum conservation requires
the vector sum of the transverse energy and momentum of all of the final
particles to be zero. The transverse energy @xmath and transverse
momentum @xmath for a particle produced in a @xmath collision are
defined by @xmath and @xmath . We use the convention that “momentum”
refers to @xmath and “mass” to @xmath .

Another quantity invariant under Lorentz boosts along the beamline is
Rapidity, which is defined as @xmath , where @xmath is the longitudinal
momentum along the beamline and E is the energy.

Pseudorapidity @xmath is used by high energy physicists and is defined
as @xmath . For massless particles @xmath .

Hard @xmath head-on collisions produce significant momentum in the
transverse plane. The CDF detector has been optimized to measure these
events. Typically, particles in a @xmath collision event tend to be more
in the forward and backward regions than in the central region because
there is usually a boost along the @xmath -axis. The derivative of
@xmath is @xmath .

A constant @xmath slice corresponds to variant @xmath slice which is
smaller in the forward and backward regions than in the central region.
This makes the @xmath occupancy more uniform than @xmath occupancy.
Therefore, for example, calorimeters are constructed in @xmath slices
instead of @xmath slices.

#### 2.2.2 Tracking

The CDF detector features excellent charged particle tracking and good
electron and muon identification in the central region. The detector is
built around a 3 m diameter, 5 m long superconducting solenoid operated
at 1.4 T. The tracking volume is surrounded by the solenoid magnet and
the endplug calorimeters as shown in Figure 2.3 .

The CDF tracking system includes a central outer drift chamber (COT) and
the silicon tracker. The main parameters of the CDF tracking system are
summarized in Table 2.1 .

The Silicon Tracker

Enhanced system of silicon microstrip detectors [ 38 ] consists of three
components: Layer 00, the Silicon VerteX detector II (SVX II), and the
Intermediate Silicon Layers (ISL). @xmath view of the silicon tracker is
shown in Figure 2.5 .

A single layer rad-hard Layer 00 detector is mounted on and supported by
the beam pipe. The Layer 00 single-sided sensors provide 6 @xmath m
axial hit resolution.

The next five layers compose the SVX II and are double-sided detectors.
The axial side of each layer is used for @xmath - @xmath measurements.
The stereo side of each layer is used for @xmath - @xmath measurements.

The two outer layers compose the ISL and are double-sided detectors.
This entire system allows charged particle track reconstruction in three
dimensions. The impact parameter resolution of SVX II + ISL is 40 @xmath
m including 30 @xmath m contribution from the beamline. The @xmath
resolution of SVX II + ISL is 70 @xmath m. The main parameters of the
silicon tracker are summarized in Table 2.1 .

The Central Outer Tracker (COT)

The COT [ 37 ] is a multi-wire open-cell drift chamber for charged
particle reconstruction, occupying the radial region from 44 to 132 cm
and @xmath 155 cm. The COT replaced the Central Tracking Chamber (CTC),
which, in addition to aging problems observed during Run I, would also
suffer from degraded performance at @xmath . The major problem with the
CTC would be its maximum drift time (800 ns) relative to the expected
bunch crossing time in Run II (132 ns).

To address this, the COT uses small drift cells ( @xmath 2 cm wide, a
factor of 4 smaller than the CTC) and a fast gas to limit drift times to
less than 130 ns. Each cell consists of 12 sense wires oriented in a
plane, tilted with respect to the radial (Figure 2.5 ). A group of such
cells at a given radius is called a superlayer. There are eight
alternating superlayers (Figure 2.5 ) of stereo (nominal angle of 2
@xmath , used for @xmath - @xmath measurement) and axial (used for
@xmath - @xmath measurement) wire planes. The main parameters of the COT
are summarized in Table 2.1 .

The COT is filled with a mixture of Argon:Ethane = 50:50 which
determines the drift velocity. A charged particle travels through the
gas mixture and produces ionization electrons. The electrons drift
toward the sense wires in the electric field created by cathode field
panels and potential wires of the cell. In the crossed magnetic and
electric fields electrons originally at rest move in the plane
perpendicular to the magnetic field at an angle @xmath with respect to
the electric field lines. The value of @xmath depends on the magnitude
of both magnetic and electric fields and the properties of the gas
mixture. In the COT @xmath .

The optimal situation for the resolution is when the drift direction is
perpendicular to that of the track, which is true for high @xmath tracks
because they are almost radial. To make the ionization electrons drift
in the @xmath direction all COT cells are tilted by 35 @xmath with
respect to the radial.

When an electron gets near a sense wire the local 1/r field accelerates
them causing more ionization and thus forms an ”avalanche” producing a
signal (hit) on the sense wire. By measuring the arrival time of “first”
electrons (drift time) at sense wire relative to collision time, the
distance of the hit is calculated.

COT tracks above 1.5 GeV are available for triggering at Level 1 (XFT
tracks). SVX layers 0-3 are combined with XFT tracks at Level-2 (SVT
tracks) (see Section 2.2.7 for the description of CDF Run II trigger
system).

#### 2.2.3 Calorimetry

The energy measurement is done by sampling calorimeters, which are
absorber and sampling scintillator sandwiches with phototube readout.
Outside the solenoid, Pb-scintillator electromagnetic (EM) and
Fe-scintillator hadronic (HAD) calorimeters cover the range @xmath . The
central calorimeter systems have been retained from Run I, but the plug
calorimeters are new detectors for Run II.

Both the central ( @xmath ) and plug ( @xmath ) electromagnetic
calorimeters have fine grained shower profile detectors at electron
shower maximum, and preshower pulse height detectors at approximately
@xmath depth. Electron identification is accomplished using @xmath from
the EM calorimeter; using @xmath ; and using shower shape and position
matching in the shower max detectors. The calorimeter cell segmentation
is summarized in Table 2.2 and shown in Figure 3.5 . A comparison of the
central and plug calorimeters is given in Table 2.3 .

The region 0.77 @xmath 1.0, 75 @xmath 90 @xmath is uninstrumented to
allow for cryogenic utilities servicing the solenoid.

Any high energy electron or photon passing through the electromagnetic
calorimeters, will undergo pair production ( @xmath ) and bremsstrahlung
( @xmath ) thus producing an electromagnetic shower. The point at which
the electromagnetic shower consists of the largest amount of particles
is known as the shower maximum. At this point the average energy per
particle becomes low enough to prevent further multiplication. After the
shower maximum, the shower decays slowly through ionization losses for
the electrons and positrons or by Compton scattering for the photons.
The calorimeters measure the energy deposited by these showers, and
hence the energy of the incident particle. Electromagnetic calorimeters
are designed to fully contain showers from electrons and photons.

Hadrons lose energy by nuclear interaction cascades which can have
pions, protons, kaons, neutrons, neutrinos, muons, photons, etc. This is
significantly more complicated than an electromagnetic cascade and thus
results in a large fluctuation in energy measurement.

##### Central Calorimeters

The central calorimeters consist of the central electromagnetic
calorimeter (CEM) [ 39 ] , the central hadronic calorimeter (CHA) [ 40 ]
, and the end wall hadronic calorimeter (WHA).

The CEM and CHA are constructed in wedges which span 15 @xmath in
azimuth and extend about 250 cm in the positive and negative @xmath
direction, shown in Figure 2.9 . There are thus 24 wedges on both the
@xmath and @xmath sides of the detector, for a total of 48. A wedge
contains ten towers, each of which covers a range 0.11 in
pseudorapidity. Thus each tower subtends @xmath in @xmath . The CEM
covers @xmath , the CHA covers @xmath , and the WHA covers @xmath .

The CEM uses lead sheets interspersed with polysterene scintillator as
the active medium and employs phototube readout, approximately 19 @xmath
in depth, and has an energy resolution of @xmath ¹ ¹ 1 @xmath denotes
addition in quadrature .

To provide more accurate information on the position of the
electromagnetic shower inside the calorimeter, the Central
Electromagnetic Shower (CES) [ 39 ] detector is embedded inside the CEM
at the shower maximum, at a depth of approximately 6 radiation lengths.
The CES detector is a proportional strip and wire chamber situated at a
radius of 184 cm from the beamline. In the azimuthal direction, cathode
strips are used to provide the z position and in the @xmath direction,
anode wires are used. These wires can effectively measure the transverse
shower profile to distinguish between a single shower from a prompt
photon and two showers from a decay of a neutral meson to two photons,
e.g. @xmath , with a position resolution of 2 mm at 50 GeV.

In order to help particle identification, specifically between
electromagnetic and hadronic showers the central preradiator detector
(CPR) is mounted on the front of the calorimeter wedges, at a radius of
168 cm from the beamline, and uses the solenoid and tracking detectors
as a radiator. It uses proportional chambers to sample the early
development of the shower to measure conversions in the coil, helping to
distinguish prompt photons and electrons from photons originating from
@xmath decays and electrons from conversions. A prompt photon has a 60%
probability of converting, while the conversion probability of at least
one photon from @xmath is about 80% [ 41 ] .

The CHA and WHA use steel absorber interspersed with acrylic
scintillator as the active medium. They are approximately 4.5 @xmath in
depth, and have an energy resolution of @xmath , as measured on the test
beam for single pions [ 40 ] .

##### Plug Calorimeters

The plug calorimeters consist of the plug electromagnetic calorimeter
(PEM) [ 42 ] , and the plug hadronic calorimeter (PHA). At approximately
6 @xmath in depth in PEM is the plug shower maximum detector (PES).
Figure 2.9 shows the layout of the detector and coverage in polar angle
@xmath ( @xmath ). Each plug wedge spans 15 @xmath in azimuth, however
in the range @xmath ( @xmath ) the segmentation in azimuth is doubled
and each tower spans only 7.5 @xmath .

The PEM is a lead-scintillator sampling calorimeter. It is approximately
21 @xmath in depth, and has an energy resolution of @xmath . The PES
consists of two layers of scintillating strips: U and V layers offset
from the radial direction by @xmath and @xmath respectively, as shown in
Figure 2.9 . The position resolution of the PES is about 1 mm. The PHA
is a steel-scintillator sampling calorimeter. It is approximately 7
@xmath in depth, and has an energy resolution of @xmath , as measured on
the test beam for single pions [ 40 ] .

#### 2.2.4 Muon Systems

The muon is a minimum ionizing particle which loses very little energy
in detector materials. The muon’s lifetime, 2.2 @xmath s, is long enough
for the muon to pass through all the detector components, reach the muon
chambers and decay outside.

There are four independent muon systems: the central muon detector (CMU)
[ 43 ] , the central muon upgrade (CMP) [ 44 ] , the central muon
extension (CMX) [ 45 ] , and the intermediate muon detector (IMU). The
calorimeter steel serves as a filter for muon detection in the CMU and
CMX, over the range @xmath , @xmath GeV. Additional iron shielding,
including the magnet yoke, provides a muon filter for the CMP in the
range @xmath , @xmath GeV. The (non-energized) forward toroids from
Run I provide muon filters for IMU in the range @xmath for @xmath GeV.
Scintillators for triggering are included in CMP, CMX, and IMU.

Muon identification is accomplished by matching track segments in the
muon chambers with COT/SVX tracks; matching is available in @xmath for
all detectors and in @xmath in CMU and CMX. The parameters for the muon
systems are summarized in Table 2.4 . The IMU, which provides coverage
in the forward region will not be discussed in detail, as it is not used
for this analysis.

The coverage for the muon systems in @xmath space is shown in Figure
2.12 . CMU, CMP and CMX muon systems are also shown in Figure 3.6 .

A muon chamber contains a stacked array of drift tubes and operates with
a gas mixture of Argon:Ethane = 50:50. The basic drift principle is the
same as that of the COT, but the COT is a multi-wire chamber, whereas at
the center of a muon drift tube there is only a single sense wire. The
sense wire is connected to a positive high voltage (HV) while the wall
of the tube is connected to a negative HV to produce a roughly uniform
time-to-distance relationship throughout the tube. The drift time of a
single hit gives the distance to the sense wire, and the charge division
at each end of a sense wire can in principle be used to measure the
longitudinal coordinate along the sense wire. The hits in the muon
chamber are linked together to form a short track segment called a muon
stub (Figure 2.10 ). If a muon stub is matched to an extrapolated track
in the tracking system (Section 2.2.2 ), a muon is reconstructed.

##### CMU and CMP

The CMU is unchanged from Run I. It is located behind the towers of the
CHA and divided into wedges covering 12.6 @xmath in azimuth for @xmath
0.6. Only muons with a @xmath 1.4 GeV reach the CMU. Each wedge has
three towers, each comprised of four layers of four drift tubes. The
second and fourth layers are offset by 2 mm in @xmath direction from the
first and third as shown in Figure 2.10 . Six CMU wedges and their
relative location with respect to CMX and CMP (outer box) subsystems are
shown in Figure 2.12 .

A 50 @xmath m diameter stainless steel resistive sense wire is located
in the center of each cell. The wires in the cells in the first and
third (second and fourth) layers are connected in the readout. Each wire
pair is instrumented with a time-to-digital converter (TDC) to measure
the @xmath -position of the muon and an analogue-to-digital converter
(ADC) on each end to measure z position via charge division. The
position resolution of the detector is 250 @xmath m in the drift
direction (r- @xmath ) and 1.2 mm in the sense wire direction (z).

Approximately 0.5% of high energy hadrons produced will pass through the
CMU creating an irreducible fake muon background. In order to reduce
this effect, an additional muon chamber (CMP) is installed behind 60 cm
of steel.

The CMP consists of a four-sided box placed on the outside of the CDF
detector. Muons with @xmath 2.2 GeV can reach the CMP. The rectangular
form of the CMP detector means that its @xmath varies in azimuth (Figure
2.12 ). The CMP covers @xmath .

The maximum drift time of the CMU is longer than the @xmath bunch
crossing separation, which can cause an ambiguity in the Level 1 trigger
(Section 2.2.7 ). To resolve the ambiguity scintillation counters are
used. The scintillation counters (CSP) are installed on the outer
surface of the CMP.

##### Central Muon Extension (CMX)

The CMX has eight layers and extends the @xmath coverage to @xmath . It
consists of two 120 @xmath arches located at each end of the central
detector, as shown in Figure 2.12 . The uninstrumented regions have been
filled by the insertion of a 30 @xmath keystone at the top, and two 90
@xmath miniskirts for the lower gaps. There is a gap in the coverage on
the east side due to cryogenic utilities servicing the solenoid as shown
in Figure 2.12 , known as the ”chimney”.

A layer of scintillation counters (the CSX) is installed on both the
inside and the outside surfaces of the CMX. No additional steel was
added for this detector because the large angle through the hadron
calorimeter, magnet yoke, and steel of the detector end support
structure provides more absorber material than in the central muon
detectors.

#### 2.2.5 Time of Flight System

The Time of Flight detector (TOF) [ 46 ] measures the time taken by a
particle to travel from the interaction point to the detector, and has a
particle timing resolution of 100 ps. This information can be used to
differentiate between different particle types (e.g. kaons, pions) and
also to help tag cosmic ray events.

The TOF is situated between the COT and the solenoid. It consists of 216
scintillator bars with dimensions 4 @xmath 4 @xmath 276 cm. At each end
of the scintillator bars a photomultiplier tube is mounted

#### 2.2.6 Cherenkov Luminosity Counters

Luminosity ( @xmath ) is a measure of particle interaction, specifically
the chance that a proton will collide with an antiproton. The rate of
inelastic scattering in @xmath interactions can be used to determine the
@xmath .

A gas Cherenkov Luminosity Counter (CLC) [ 47 ] measures the number of
interactions per beam crossing to determine the luminosity of the
Tevatron. There are two CLCs positioned between the beam-pipe and the
plug calorimeters, covering the region 3.7 @xmath 4.7. Each CLC consists
of 48 thin, conical gas-filled Cherenkov counters. They are arranged in
three concentric circles, each consisting of 16 counters (see, for
example, Figure 3.7 ).

The luminosity of a @xmath collider can be estimated using the equation:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where f is the frequency of bunch crossing, @xmath is the average number
of interactions per beam crossing, given by the CLC hit rate (about
5-6), and @xmath is the inelastic cross-section of @xmath scattering.
The average of the inelastic cross-sections as measured by CDF Run I and
the E811 [ 48 ] is 60.7 @xmath 2.3 mb [ 49 ] .

A total systematic uncertainty of 6% is quoted for all luminosity
measurements. This includes a 4.4% contribution from the acceptance and
operation of the luminosity monitor and 4.0% from the theoretical
uncertainty on the calculation of the total @xmath cross-section [ 49 ]
.

#### 2.2.7 Trigger and Data Acquisition

Many interesting physics processes have cross sections which are many
orders of magnitude smaller than the total inelastic cross section. The
collision rate at the Tevatron is much higher than the rate at which
data can be recorded. Therefore, the trigger needs to be fast and
accurate to record as many interesting events as possible, while
rejecting uninteresting events.

To accomplish this, the CDF trigger system has a three-level
architecture: Level 1 (L1), Level 2 (L2), and Level 3 (L3). The data
volume is reduced at each level, which allows more refined filtering at
subsequent levels with minimal deadtime. Each sub-detector generates
primitives which can be used in the trigger system to select events. The
trigger system block diagram is shown in Figure 2.13 .

At L1 axial layers of the COT are used by eXtreme Fast Tracker (XFT) to
reconstruct @xmath and @xmath for the tracks. Based on the XFT tracks
and a ratio of the hadronic energy to the electromagnetic energy of a
calorimeter tower (HAD/EM ratio) electrons and photons are then
reconstructed. Muons are reconstructed by matching XFT and muon hits.
Jets are reconstructed based on a sum of the electromagnetic and
hadronic energies for a tower. and @xmath (a scalar sum of the energies
of all of the calorimeter towers) are also reconstructed at L1.

L1 is a synchronous hardware trigger and it makes a decision within 4
@xmath s. This trigger reduces the event rate from 7.6 MHz to 50 KHz,
which is limited by the L2 processing time. Accepted events are then
passed to the L2 hardware.

At L2 SVX layers 0-3 are combined with XFT tracks (Figure 2.13 .). The
L2 uses jet clustering as well as improved momentum resolution for
tracks, finer angular matching between muon stubs and central tracks and
data from the CES for improved identification of electrons and photons.

The L2 decision time is about 20 @xmath s. L2 is a combination of
hardware and software triggers and is asynchronous. If an event is
accepted by L1, the front-end electronics moves the data to one of the
four onboard L2 buffers. This is sufficient to process a L1 50 KHz
accept rate and to average out the rate fluctuations. The L2 accept rate
is about 300 Hz which is limited by the speed of the event builder in
L3.

L3 is a purely software trigger consisting of the event builder running
on a large PC farm. Data which passes one of the specified trigger paths
is reconstructed at L3 using full detector information and the latest
calibrations. The L3 accept rate of about 75 Hz is limited by the speed
of writing data to tape for the permanent storage.

As soon as an event passes L3 it is delivered to the data-logger
subsystem which sends the event out to permanent storage for offline
reprocess, and to online monitors which verify that the entire detector
and trigger systems are working properly. One of the online monitors,
CDF Run II Event Display, is described in detail in Section 3 .

## Chapter 3 CDF Run II Event Display

Event displays are indispensable tools for data analysis in high energy
physics experiments. They help to understand the physics of a recorded
interaction, to diagnose the apparatus, to make the detector geometry
imaginable and to illustrate the whole matter to general audiences.

CDF Run II Event Display (EVD) [ 11 ] is a major contribution to the
commissioning and operation of CDF II detector. Development and support
of the EVD package [ 10 ] is one of the responsibilities of the
ITEP(Moscow) group at CDF [ 13 ] .

The data from the collider experiment is a stream of signals from
subdetectors. The detector ”sees” these signals as sequences of
impulses, distributed over many channels of different subdetectors (see
Section 2.2 ). The signals are analyzed by powerful pattern recognition
and analysis programs, which create more sophisticated objects like
clusters, segments, stubs and then tracks, muons, electrons/photons,
jets, etc.

Typically physics results are based on statistical analysis of many
events. The standard forms of presentation are histograms, graphs and
tables. However, a graphical representation of a single event a powerful
tool for checking the validity of reconstruction or analysis algorithms.
For a quick assessments of error conditions as well as for public
presentations the visual representation is the most efficient way to
transfer information to a human brain.

Higher event multiplicities and higher momenta of outgoing particles are
matched by detectors with a growing number of subunits of increasing
granularity, resolution and precision. As a consequence pictures of
detectors and events are getting more complicated and may even get
incomprehensible. This leads to a question if the presentation of data
via visual techniques is useful for complicated events at the Tevatron.

### 3.1 Overview

The aim of the EVD is to enable visual representation of the objects
existing in the CDF Run II software. EVD interacts both with the data
and with the simulation and reconstruction packages. For simulated data
EVD visualizes the Decay Tree, which is constructed from HEPG
information.

It is natural to define three kinds of objects: Real Objects (Section
3.1.1 ), Graphical Objects (Section 3.1.2 ), and Views (Section 3.1.3 ).
To visualize Real Objects and to access information about the event,
Operations (Section 3.1.4 ) are performed on the Graphical Objects and
Views .

#### 3.1.1 Real Objects

A Real Object is information from a subdetector or combined information
from several subdetectors. For example, to identify electron one needs
calorimeter and tracking information. Some of the Real Objects in CDF
are listed below:

-   Tracking information (Section 2.2.2 )
    – axial and stereo hits from the COT
    – hits from the silicon tracker
    – tracks reconstructed with different tracking algoritms

-   Calorimeter information (Section 2.2.3 )
    – Central and Plug Shower Chambers information
    – Central and Plug Preradiator information

-   Hits from TOF system (Section 2.2.5 )

-   Information from the muon systems (Section 2.2.4 )
    – Hits from the muon systems
    – Track segments reconstructed in the muon chambers

-   Information from East and West CLC subdetectors, which are used to
    monitor luminosity and to identify diffractive events (Section 2.2.6
    )

-   Information from Beam Shower Counters [ 50 ] , used to identify
    diffractive events

-   Information from CDF Run II L1/L2/L3 Trigger System (Section 2.2.7 )

-   EM Timing information [ 51 ]

-   Pre-reconstructed objects, such as Muon, Electron, Photon, Jet
    Candidates,

-   Full information about raw and reconstructed data
    – access to banks and collections in the event

A major requirement has been made to keep analysis in the EVD to a
minimum, as objects are identified differently in different analyses
(i.e. loose electron for one analysis may be a jet in some other
analysis). However, EVD has a functionality to clean complicated events
by selective presentation of parts of the data and the detector.
(Section 3.1.4 ). For example, EVD can show or hide tracks depending on
their properties ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , number of hits in
a subsystem etc.).

#### 3.1.2 Graphical Objects

Real Objects in the EVD are mapped to their visual representation into
Graphical Objects of different types, corresponding to different Views .
The graphical objects correspond to the stored real objects (for
example, to the list of hits and tracks) and other real objects (for
example, to electron, muon and photon candidates) created from them.

The properties of Real Objects are used to display Graphical Objects .
For instance, information from the calorimeter is shown as towers with a
size proportional to the deposited energy. We use graphics libraries
available in the ROOT package [ 52 ] .

#### 3.1.3 Views

View is a method of visualizing a set of graphical objects. For a user,
view is generally a window with a defined way of displaying Graphical
Objects . We define three categories of views for the CDF Run II Event
Display:

1.   Realistic Views are obtained by either a sequence of rotations,
    linear scaling, and projections of a geometry of detector/identified
    objects. Realistic views are understood intuitively, although the
    pictures may become too complex (for example, see Figures 3.4 and
    3.6 ).

    Hits density as well as detector precision grow towards the
    interaction point. Therefore, an ability to hide parts of the
    detector obscuring the picture is crucial. Another feature of the
    EVD is to show or hide Graphical objects depending on the properties
    of Real Objects (number of hits, drift time etc.)

2.   Schematic Views can be obtained from realistic views by changing
    the aspect ratio or focal length for a subdetector. For example, the
    scale may be decreased with increasing radius, so that the inner
    subdetectors appear enlarged. This emphasizes the commonly used
    construction principle of detectors, namely that precision and
    sampling distance decrease, when stepping from the inner to the
    outer detectors.

    Schematic Views do not necessarily represent the detector in its
    real proportions or shapes. For example a box that changes color
    depending on error conditions may serve as a schematic view of any
    detector component. In many cases the schematic views are relatively
    easy to understand and very efficient to use (for example, see
    Figure 3.3 ).

3.   Abstract Views have little resemblance to the detector image in
    cartesian space. These views are not intuitively understood but
    given some training may be the most powerful. Examples of abstract
    views are angular projections, histograms, LEGO plots, etc. (for
    example, see Figure 3.5 )

#### 3.1.4 Operations

Operations on Graphical Objects :
These operations only change the visual properties of the graphical
objects, the real objects are not changed. Visual operations can be
performed on the graphical objects or on the views. The following
operations on graphical objects are supported:

-   rotation, zooming, translation, scaling

-   viewpoint changing

-   object hiding/unhiding

-   sub-view creation

-   redefinition of visual properties of graphical objects

Operations on Real Objects :
Operations on real objects can access information about the objects or
change the state of these objects. In addition, visual properties of the
corresponding graphics objects can also be changed as a result of
changing real objects. The following operations on real objects are
supported:

-   access to public member functions for an object from the EVD

-   obtaining the detailed information on an object properties (for
    example, for tracks one can access information on number/type of
    hits in COT/Silicon detectors, dE/dx, @xmath , @xmath , @xmath etc.)

-   access to event record information (data banks and collections)

-   application of identification cuts

-   interface to a histogramming package

### 3.2 CDF Run II Application Framework

The design of the EVD is based on the belief that both requirements and
graphics software abilities will be very broad at any time and will
constantly evolve. The EVD is designed to accommodate that diversity and
change. This can be accomplished only by sufficient flexibility and
modularity of the core control structure [ 53 ] .

An application framework, in the context of a high energy physics
experiment, is a ”system” that allows physicist-developed code to be
combined with code developed by other people and to be used in both the
online and offline environments. Either real or simulated data can be
used as the input and the output can include (modified) copy of the
input as well as additional reconstructed quantities. This output then
forms the input in the next stage of a multi-stage data reduction
environment. CDF Run II Application Framework (AC++) is based on the
ROOT object oriented analysis framework [ 52 ] , which is incorporated
in CDF Run II C++ software.

The AC++ provides a unified framework for event reconstruction,
post-production analysis and online monitoring, triggering and
calibration. The goals of the framework is to provide a simple and
straightforward means of combining any number of independent classes,
called modules, into a single executable and to provide a flexible
system for specifying (either interactively or in a batch mode) how
these modules are run.

Therefore, EVD has the flexibility to enable/disable different modules,
so that one can work with unprocessed data for the immediate feedback.
Alternatively, one can also run reconstruction modules inside the EVD
with user-defined parameters for debugging purposes.

### 3.3 Graphical User Interface

The start of the EVD is signalled by the appearance of the manager
window (Figure 3.1 ,a). From the manager window user select one of the
event displays, and control automatic looping through events, as is done
in the CDF Run II control room at @xmath . The name of the input file is
displayed at the bottom.

Clicking the Panel button brings up the EVD control panel (Figure 3.1 ,
b). The control panel allows user to configure the behavior of the EVD.
User may select which data to read using the DataMenu (Figure 3.1 , c)

Complicated events might be cleaned by selective presentation of parts
of the data and the detector. User can specify cuts on physical
quantities of the displayed objects, such as the @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath of tracks or the energies deposited in the calorimeter towers.
This helps to clean up the event by removing low- @xmath tracks and low-
@xmath towers, or to debug reconstruction problems by requiring EVD to
show objects which pass some cuts (e.g. number of COT or Silicon hits,
or tracks with large @xmath etc.). Figure 3.2 shows sample Cut Manager
session.

### 3.4 Displays

#### 3.4.1 @xmath and @xmath Views

In layered projections, each geometry object acquires a 2-dimensional
shape which can be different in each projection. For example, the drift
chamber outline is a circle in the @xmath view and a rectangle in the
@xmath view.

The @xmath view (COT Display, Figure 3.3 ) shows hits in the
subdetectors (COT, Silicon trackers, Muon Chambers, TOF, XTRP etc.),
energies in the central EM and HAD calorimeter towers (summed over
@xmath ), missing @xmath information, information about CDF
reconstructed objects, such as @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , jet
candidates. It also gives the information about run/event number, as
well as trigger information.

Figure 3.3 is an example of a schematic view (Section 3.1.3 ), and it is
obtained from a realistic @xmath projection by applying a fish-eye
transformation to a COT volume.

A fish-eye view introduces a nonlinear transformation of radius in the
layered @xmath projection, with the aim to enable simultaneous
inspection of tracking chambers, calorimetry and muon system within the
same picture (Figure 3.3 ).

The @xmath view (Figure 3.4 ) is designed to show the same information
as @xmath view, but in @xmath projection. The only exception are COT
hits, which do not have z coordinate and therefore are displayed in
@xmath projection only. Energies in the central EM and HAD calorimeter
towers are summed over @xmath . Figure 3.4 is an example of a realistic
view (Section 3.1.3 ).

User can “slice” the detector by selectin pair of opposite wedges
(”Select Slice” option at the bottom of the RZ display menu, Figure 3.4
) to reduce the amount of information displayed. In this case one will
have only those wedges’ tracks, hits, bits, and calorimeter towers.
There are 24 15 @xmath wedges, which are displayed in 12 opposite pairs.
The default slice value is -1, which folds all upper wedges onto the top
and all lower wedges onto the bottom, which is the way the RZ display
used to work in CDF Run I.

#### 3.4.2 Lego Displays

These are generic LEGO plot windows (Figure 3.5 ) showing a variable (E,
@xmath , ADC counts) as a function of eta-phi. Figure 3.5 is an example
of an abstract view (Section 3.1.3 ). @xmath grid corresponds to @xmath
segmentation of CDF calorimeter system (Section 2.2.3 ); each bin on the
lego display represents a tower. Towers corresponding to CDF Run II
particle candidates (e, @xmath , @xmath , jets) have been added to LEGO
views to improve the display (see Figure 3.5 ). User can interactively
rotate LEGO display/change default settings to obtain a better view of
an event.

There also many other LEGO-based views, used to monitor/debug specific
subdetectors, such as the PLUG/PPR Views to visualize Plug Calorimeter
information, and the CES View to show the sums of energies for CES
Strips and Wires. In addition to the views itself there is an interface
to a histogramming package to obtain specific distributions. For
example, one can see distributions of measurements in strips/wires of
the CES. Views are designed to give a general idea about an event, and
histograms allow to see more detailed picture for a part of a
subdetector.

#### 3.4.3 3D Displays

Perspective 3-dimensional views with hidden lines and hidden surface
removal are very useful for understanding detector geometry, and provide
attractive pictures for public relation (PR) purposes (Figure 3.6 ).
Analyzing the event itself is often less successful in this mode, since
the complicated geometry tends to obscure the tracks and hits.

Figure 3.6 is an example of a realistic view (Section 3.1.3 ). There are
several available 3D views which one can use separately for specific
needs or combine to obtain a complicated view.

-   CDF 3D display
    – 3-dimensional view of the CDF detector with tracks/silicon
    hits/muon hits and stubs)

-   3D calorimeter display
    – central and plug calorimeter towers together with tracks

-   SVX 3D display
    – dedicated silicon detector display, which shows the silicon
    hits/strips together with tracks). SVX 3D display is designed to
    obtain detailed information for all silicon hits associated with a
    given track, which is helpful for debugging purposes.

Three-dimensional Views with hidden lines and surface removal are
possible through the special OpenGL viewer which is integrated in view.
Figure 3.6 has been obtained using OpenGL. In this mode live rotations
are possible given a suitable hardware acceleration for the
instantaneous response.

#### 3.4.4 Other Displays

There many other views (see Figure 3.7 ), used to monitor different CDF
Run II subsystems and to analyze real and simulated data:

-   Wedge Display
    – CES/CPR information together with central calorimeter information

-   Trigger Display
    – Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 trigger bits and corresponding names

-   BSC Display
    – shows ADC counts from beam shower counter subdetectors

-   CLC Display
    – shows ADC counts from Cherenkov Luminosity Counters

-   MC Decay Tree Display
    – decay tree constructed from HEPG information for the simulated
    data

### 3.5 Live Events

The Live Events page has been designed to provide attractive pictures
for PR purposes [ 12 ] . The Views displayed on Figure 3.7 from the top
to the bottom are as follows:

    information. COT Display zoomed to access silicon tracker

### 3.6 Conclusions

From the very beginning of Run II data taking EVD is in continuous use
for the online monitoring and for the analyses. This answers the
question whether a presentation of data via visual techniques is
possible for complicated events at the Tevatron. More importantly,
features of the EVD make it to be one of the most important tools for a
better understanding of the events which could possibly be New Physics
candidates in a CDF Run II data.

## Chapter 4 @xmath Selection

### 4.1 Datasets

The data presented in the thesis was taken between March 21, 2002, and
August 22, 2004 and represent @xmath for which the silicon detector
(Section 2.2.2 ) [ 38 ] , and all three central muon systems (CMP, CMU
and CMX), described in Section 2.2.4 were operational.

The @xmath candidates are taken from a logical ‘OR’ of the inclusive
high- @xmath muon sample and the inclusive high- @xmath photon sample;
this was done to ensure a high and stable trigger efficiency for the
muons. For consistency, @xmath candidates are also obtained from a
logical ’OR’ of the inclusive high- @xmath electron sample and the
inclusive high- @xmath photon sample. Each of the samples ¹ ¹ 1 We used
bhel0d as high- @xmath electron sample; bhmu0d as high- @xmath muon
sample; and cph10d as high- @xmath photon sample was ntupled using the
UC flat ntuple [ 54 ] .

To accept an event from the inclusive high- @xmath lepton sample we
require the event to have a loose lepton and a photon, or two leptons
(either tight or loose), or a tight lepton and @xmath (see Tables 5.1 ,
6.1 , 6.2 and 7.1 ).

To accept an event from the inclusive high- @xmath photon sample we
require the event to have a tight photon (see Table 7.1 ) and a loose
lepton. The muon selection criteria are listed in Table 5.1 ; the
electron selection criteria are listed in Tables 6.1 and 6.2 ;

We check data integrity during the run by plotting the stability of the
event yields for the control samples. We use the 8 time intervals
defined in Table 4.1 [ 55 ] . The boundaries of the intervals have been
chosen to correspond to shutdowns or to major changes in the trigger
table. The luminosity in each bin is plotted in Figure 4.1 .

To summarize, in the resulting inclusive electron and muon samples every
event contains either a @xmath candidate, or a candidate for the @xmath
and @xmath control samples, described in detail below in Chapters 5 and
6 .

### 4.2 Selection Overview

Events with a high transverse momentum ( @xmath ) lepton or photon are
selected by a three-level trigger [ 43 ] that requires an event to have
either a lepton with @xmath or a photon with @xmath within the central
region, @xmath . The trigger system selects photon and electron
candidates from clusters of energy in the central electromagnetic
calorimeter. Electrons are further distinguished from photons by
requiring the presence of a COT track pointing at the cluster. The muon
trigger requires a COT track that extrapolates to a reconstructed track
segment (“stub”) in the muon drift chambers.

We use the same kinematic event selection as in the Run I analysis:
inclusive @xmath events are selected by requiring a central photon
candidate with @xmath @xmath , a central lepton candidate ( @xmath or
@xmath ) with @xmath @xmath passing the “tight” criteria listed below,
and a point of origin along the beam-line not more than 60 cm from the
center of the detector.

A muon candidate (Chapter 5 ) passing the “tight” cuts has the following
properties: a) a well-measured track in the COT; b) energies deposited
in the electromagnetic and hadron compartments of the calorimeter
consistent with expectations; c) a muon “stub” track in the CMX detector
or in both the CMU and CMP detectors [ 43 ] consistent with the
extrapolated position of the COT track; and d) COT timing measurements
consistent with a track from a @xmath collision and not from a cosmic
ray.

An electron candidate (Chapter 6 ) passing the “tight” selection has the
following properties: a) a high-quality track with @xmath of at least
half the shower energy, unless the @xmath @xmath , in which case the
@xmath threshold is set to 25 @xmath ; b) a transverse shower profile
consistent with an electron shower shape and that matches the
extrapolated track position; c) a lateral sharing of energy in the two
calorimeter towers containing the electron shower consistent with that
expected; and d) minimal leakage into the hadron calorimeter.

Photon candidates (Chapter 7 ) are required to have no track with @xmath
@xmath , and at most one track with @xmath @xmath , pointing at the
calorimeter cluster; good profiles in both transverse dimensions at
shower maximum; and minimal leakage into the hadron calorimeter.

To reduce background from photons or leptons from the decays of hadrons
produced in jets, both the photon and the lepton in each event are
required to be “isolated”. The @xmath deposited in the calorimeter
towers in a cone in @xmath space of radius @xmath around the photon or
lepton position is summed, and the @xmath due to the photon or lepton is
subtracted. The remaining @xmath in the cone is required to be less than
@xmath for a photon, or less than 10% of the @xmath for electrons or
@xmath for muons. In addition, for photons the sum of the @xmath of all
COT tracks in the cone must be less than @xmath .

Missing transverse energy (Section 8.1 ) is calculated from the
calorimeter tower energies in the region @xmath . Corrections are then
made to the for non-uniform calorimeter response [ 56 ] for jets with
uncorrected @xmath @xmath and @xmath , and for muons with @xmath @xmath
.

We use @xmath and @xmath production as control samples (see Section 5.2
for the details for the muon channel and Section 6.2 for the electron
channel) to ensure that the efficiencies for high- @xmath electrons and
muons, as well as for , are well understood. The photon control sample
is constructed from the events in which one of the electrons radiates a
high- @xmath photon, with an additional requirement that the @xmath
invariant mass be within 10 @xmath of the @xmath mass.

The first search we perform is in the @xmath subsample, defined by
requiring that an event contain @xmath (Section 8.1 ) in addition to the
photon and “tight” lepton.

A second search, for the @xmath signature, is constructed by requiring
another muon (Chapter 5 ) or electron (Chapter 6 ) in addition to the
“tight” lepton and the photon. The additional muons are required to have
@xmath and to satisfy at least one of two different sets of criteria:
the same as those above for “tight” muons but with fewer hits required
on the track, or a more stringent cut on track quality but no
requirement that there be a matching “stub” in the muon systems.
Additional central electrons are required to have @xmath and to satisfy
the same criteria as tight central electrons but with a track
requirement of only @xmath @xmath (rather than 0.5 @xmath ), and no
requirement on a shower maximum measurement or lateral energy sharing
between calorimeter towers. Electrons in the end-plug calorimeters
(Section 6.1.3 ), @xmath , are required to have @xmath , minimal leakage
into the hadron calorimeter, a “track” containing at least 3 hits in the
silicon tracking system, and a shower transverse shape consistent with
that expected, with a centroid close to the extrapolated position of the
track [ 57 ] .

The analysis includes a search for @xmath events, for which the
estimated SM expectation is of order of 0.2 events. We also search for
@xmath events by requiring another photon with @xmath 25 GeV in addition
to the “tight” lepton and the photon. The additional photons are
required to pass standard photon cuts, described in Chapter 7 .

## Chapter 5 Muon Identification and Control Samples

This chapter describes the selection of muon objects that are used both
in the searches and for the control samples. We require at least one
‘tight central muon’ in an event for it to be classified as a @xmath
event. In both @xmath and @xmath events we search for additional muons
using a definition of ‘loose central muon’. In this chapter we describe
these two sets of cuts and the numbers of muon objects passing each cut
below. As this is a chapter on object identification, the tables show
the number of objects passing each cut.

The summary on the number of events in the Muon Sample is shown in Table
5.8 . The counting experiments based on event counts rather than object
counts for the @xmath candidates are described in Chapter 12 . This
chapter also describes the control samples of and decays used to check
the temporal stability, and also the product of acceptance and
efficiency.

### 5.1 Muon Selection Criteria

The muon selection cuts are similar to the standard CDF Run II cuts [ 58
] . We describe the selection of the tight muons in Section 5.1.1 . The
selection of loose muons is described in Sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.3 .

#### 5.1.1 Tight Central CMUP and CMX Muons

The muon selection criteria for a tight central muon are listed in
Tables 5.1 and are described below. Tight central muons are identified
by extrapolating tracks in the COT through the calorimeters, and the
extrapolation is required to match to a stub either in both the CMU and
CMP muon detectors (‘CMUP’ muon) or in the CMX system (’CMX’ muon), see
Table 5.2 ). Tight central muons are required to have a track-stub
matching distance less than 3 cm for CMU, less than 5 cm for CMP, and
less than 6 cm for CMX. For a CMX muon we also require COT exit radius
of the muon track @xmath (COT) to be greater than 140 cm to ensure that
the track is well-measured.

The CMUP and CMX muon identifications require a muon object with the
requisite muon stubs. There are 355105 such objects in the @xmath events
of the muon sample. These are then divided into CMUP muon candidates and
CMX muon candidates. Stubless muon candidates are treated separately in
Section 5.1.3 ; there are 55346 stubless muon objects in the @xmath
events.

The impact parameter calculation uses the default muon track rather than
the parent COT track, and a tighter impact parameter cut is applied if
the track does in fact contain silicon hits. Instead, we have tabulated
this @xmath cut for reference but we do not use it to select tight or
loose muons. The muon tracks used in the initial selection for this
analysis are beam-constrained COT-only [ 58 ] . For default muon tracks
that contain silicon we link backwards to the COT-only parent track and
use that track for all subsequent analysis. This technique, while losing
valuable information from the silicon at this stage, puts all prompt COT
tracks on the same footing.

The @xmath distributions are shown in Figure 5.1 for the muons that pass
the loose muon identification cuts (Table 5.1 ). Muon candidates which
have stubs reconstructed from hits in either the ’bluebeam’, ’miniskirt’
or ’keystone’ regions [ 58 ] of the detector are rejected. These
sections of the detector were not fully operational for the entire data
sample.

All central muons are required to have @xmath so that the collision is
well-contained within the CDF detector. In order to be well-measured,
the muon track is required to have minimum of 3 axial and 3 stereo
superlayers with at least 5 hits in each superlayer.

High energy muons are typically isolated ‘minimum-ionizing’ particles
that have limited calorimeter energy. A muon traversing the central
electromagnetic calorimeter(CEM) deposits an average energy of @xmath
0.3 GeV. Therefore we require muon candidates to deposit less than 2 GeV
total in the CEM towers (we take into account two towers in the CEM) the
muon track intersects. Similarly, muons transversing the central
hadronic calorimeter(CHA) deposit an average energy of @xmath 2 GeV; we
consequently require muon candidates to deposit a total energy less than
@xmath 6 GeV, also increasing with muon momentum, in the CHA towers
intersected by the track extrapolation. To take into account the (slow)
growth of energy loss with momentum, for very high energy muons ( @xmath
) we require the measured CEM energy to be less than @xmath and CHA
energy to be less than @xmath .

To suppress hadrons and decay muons created from hadrons in jets we
require the total transverse energy deposited in the calorimeters in a
cone of R=0.4 around the muon track direction(known as the fractional
calorimeter isolation @xmath ) to be less than 0.1 of the muon track pt.

The COT cosmic finder by itself is essentially fully efficient.
Therefore, to suppress cosmic rays we use the COT-based cosmic rejection
[ 59 ] and reject events which it tagged as cosmic ray muons.

#### 5.1.2 Loose Central CMUP and CMX Muons

While each @xmath event has to contain at least one tight CMUP or CMX
muon, both @xmath and @xmath events are searched for additional high-
@xmath muons that could come from the decays of heavy particles. There
are two types of secondary muons we accept: ‘Loose’ CMUP and CMX muons,
described here, and stubless muons (see Section 5.1.3 ).

Loose muons are muon objects with either CMUP or CMX stubs, but with
looser COT cuts than the tight CMUP or CMX muons (see Table 5.1 ). We
require 3 axial and 2 stereo COT super layers with at least 5 hits each
for loose CMUP and CMX muons.

#### 5.1.3 Loose Central Stubless Muons

The cuts for the Stubless muons, described in Table 5.3 , are looser
than the tight cuts, and in particular do not require a stub in the muon
chambers. There are three types of ‘Stubless‘ muons:

-   CMU muons (muon track matches the CMU stub only)

-   CMP muons (muon track matches a stub in the CMP only)

-   CMIO muons (muon track does not match a stub in CMU, CMP or CMX)

To identify stubless muons, we require at least some energy in the
calorimeter towers that the muon extrapolates to, Calorimeter Energy
(Em+Had) @xmath 0.1 GeV, and a good fit to the COT track, @xmath
/(Number of COT hits-5) @xmath 3 [ 58 ] . These two cuts are used to
reject charged kaon decays in flight in which a low-momentum kaon (
@xmath GeV, typically) decays inside the COT with the kaon and
decay-muon tracks forming a ‘seagull’ pattern which is reconstructed as
a single high-momentum track.

The pattern-finding algorithm often removes a complete stereo layer in
order to get a good fit, and so these tracks are badly mis-reconstructed
in polar angle. They consequently often are recorded to leave zero
energy in the extrapolated traversed calorimeter towers [ 60 ] .

### 5.2 Muon Control Samples

The @xmath and @xmath provide control samples for the @xmath samples. We
use data triggered by the high- @xmath muon trigger (MUON_CMUP_18 or
MUON_CMX_18) for both @xmath and @xmath candidates, where tight muons
are the muons that pass the cuts in Table 5.2 .

For comparisons with data we used the Monte Carlo sample [ 61 ] . We
applied the trigger efficiencies and scale factors [ 58 ] , listed in
Table 5.4 .

#### 5.2.1 The Control Sample

The selection criteria for the control sample are listed in Table 5.5 .
We require two muons in the event. One must pass the tight cuts (Table
5.2 ), and another must pass the loose cuts (Table 5.1 ). We further
require the two muons to have opposite charge, and require the
difference of the @xmath beam-line coordinates of the muon tracks to be
less than 4 cm. The last requirement for counting @xmath events is that
the invariant mass of the muon pair of the @xmath candidate should be
between 66 GeV and 116 GeV. We find @xmath @xmath events. We also find
@xmath same-sign ‘ @xmath ’ events, indicative of the maximum level of
track reconstruction problems. The selection variable distributions for
the control sample are shown in Figure 5.2 .

To normalize the MC sample, we used the measured @xmath ( ) @xmath BR [
62 ] . The comparison of data vs MC for different muon types is shown in
Table 5.7 . The event yields are shown in Figure 5.3 .

#### 5.2.2 The Control Sample

The selection criteria for the control sample are listed in Table 5.6 .
We require one tight muon ( @xmath GeV, see Table 5.2 ), and @xmath GeV
(Section 8.1 ). We require the transverse mass of the @xmath candidate
to be in the mass window 20-140 GeV.

To reject events in which one muon is not identified, events with a
second track with @xmath GeV and associated EM and HAD calorimeter
energies less than 3 and 9 GeV, respectively, are rejected. We find
@xmath events, @xmath positive and @xmath negative @xmath ’s. The event
yields are shown in Figure 5.3 .

#### 5.2.3 Summary of the Muon Control Sample Event Counts. Stability
Plots

We use the control samples of and decays to check temporal stability of
the event yields (Figure 5.3 ). The summary on the number of events in
the Muon Sample is shown in Table 5.8 .

## Chapter 6 Electron Identification and Control Samples

We require at least one ‘tight central electron’ in an event for it to
be classified as an @xmath event. In both @xmath and @xmath events we
search for additional ’loose’ electrons in the central and end-plug
electromagnetic calorimeters. We describe the tight central and loose
central and plug cuts below. The counting experiments based on event
counts rather than object counts for the @xmath candidates are described
in Chapter 12 . This chapter also describes the control samples of and
decays used to check the temporal stability, and also the product of
acceptance and efficiency.

### 6.1 Electron Selection Criteria

The electron selection cuts are similar to the standard CDF Run II cuts
[ 63 ] . We describe the selection of the tight central electrons in
Section 6.1.1 . The selection of loose central electrons is described in
Section 6.1.2 ; the selection of electrons in end-plug is presented in
Section 6.1.3 . The selection cuts are standard [ 63 ] with the
exception that the CES fiducial requirement (see Section 6.1.1 ) and the
conversion cut (see Sections A.6 and 10.2 ) are not applied.

#### 6.1.1 Tight Central Electrons

The selection criteria for tight central electrons are listed in Table
6.1 and are described below.

Electrons are identified in the CEM by matching high momentum tracks to
high-energy CEM clusters. The electron track is the highest momentum
track which intersects one of two towers in the CEM cluster. The
electron tracks that we use in this analysis are beam-constrained
COT-only. We apply the same corrections to the electron tracks as we do
to the muon tracks.

Fiduciality is a variable, which can have following values:

-   error (null strip/wire cluster)

-   not fiducial in central or plug

-   fiducial in central or plug

-   fiducial, but in CEM Tower 9

-   fiducial, but in Chimney wedge tower 7

-   fiducial in CEM using max pt track extrapolated to plane of CES

-   fiducial in PEM using PES

-   fiducial in PEM using max @xmath track extrapolated to plane of PES

An electron candidate is required to have tracking momentum (P) which
exceeds half of its calorimeter energy (E). The electron track is
required to have a minimum of 3 axial and 2 stereo SL segments
containing at least 5 hits each. In order that the momentum resolution
does not make for inefficiencies for very high-energy electrons, for
@xmath the E/P cut is not applied (leaving only the @xmath GeV cut as
the requirement on the track). The electrons are required to have the
track extrapolate to the beam line within @xmath so that CDF detector
contains the collision well.

The position of the track extrapolated to the CES radius must satisfy
the following requirements: it must fall within charge-signed CES shower
position of the cluster in the r-phi view -3.0 cm @xmath 1.5 cm and it
must fall within 3 cm of the CES shower position in the Z-direction(
@xmath ).

The CEM shower characteristics should be consistent with that of a
single charged particle. We require the ratio of the total energy of the
CHA towers located behind the CEM towers in the electron cluster to that
of the electron itself to be less than than 0.055+0.00045 @xmath E GeV.
A comparison of the lateral shower sharing with neighboring towers in
the CEM cluster with test-beam data is parameterized by a dimensionless
quantity, @xmath [ 39 ] , which must have a value less than 0.2.

We require the @xmath for the profile of energy deposited in the CES
strips compared to that expected from test beam data [ 39 ] to be less
than 10. No @xmath cut is made on the profile in the CES wires as
bremsstrahlung will separate from the electron in the @xmath view.

As an additional isolation requirement, the total transverse energy
deposited in the calorimeter in a cone R=0.4 around the electron track,
must be less than 0.1 of the @xmath of the electron. The isolation is
corrected via the standard algorithm [ 65 ] , for leakage, but not the
number of vertices.

We do not apply ’Conversion Flag’ and ’Fiducial’ cuts to select
electrons, they are tabulated for reference and to see their effects.

The acceptance gain by removing the fiduciality requirement is
approximately 14%. Figure 6.1 shows the distributions for the electrons
which pass all cuts but fiducial requirement.

#### 6.1.2 Loose Central Electrons

While each @xmath event has to contain at least one tight electron, both
@xmath and @xmath events are searched for additional high- @xmath
electrons that could come from the decays of heavy particles. The cuts
for these additional electrons are described in Table 6.1 . These cuts
are looser than the tight cuts, and in particular do not require any of
the CES variables, i.e. no track-cluster match in @xmath or @xmath and
no cut on strip @xmath , and also no cut on @xmath [ 39 ] .

#### 6.1.3 Plug Electrons

Additional isolated electrons in the plug calorimeter with @xmath GeV
are identified for measured PEM rapidities of @xmath . The cuts used for
plug electron identification are given in Table 6.4 . We require minimal
leakage or activity in the hadron calorimeter, Had/Em @xmath 0.05, a
fractional isolation (isolation energy over the electron energy) less
than 0.1, and the shower shape to satisfy the PEM 3x3 @xmath and PES
5by9 5-strip to 9 strip ratio cuts. These cuts are similar to standard
cuts [ 63 ] .

We apply face corrections to the PEM energy of the plug electron
candidate, add the PPR energy and scale resulting number by 1.0315 [ 66
] , as shown in Equation 6.1 .

  -- -- -- -------
           (6.1)
  -- -- -- -------

### 6.2 Electron Control Samples

As in the muon case, the W and @xmath provide control samples for the
@xmath samples. We require at least one tight electron pass the high-
@xmath electron trigger (ELECTRON_CENTRAL_18) for both W and @xmath
candidates, where tight electrons are the electrons that pass the cuts
in Table 6.1 .

For comparisons with data we used the MC sample [ 61 ] . We applied
trigger efficiencies [ 67 ] and scale factors [ 63 ] , which are listed
in table 6.5 . The CEM Trigger efficiency for high- @xmath electrons is
1-2.784*exp(-1.749*( @xmath - 17.86)) [ 67 ] . The total Track Trigger
efficiency is @xmath 96-98%, depending on the run number and
silicon/non-silicon list of good runs [ 67 ] .We apply this trigger
efficiency to our run-dependent MC sample.

#### 6.2.1 The Central-Central Control Sample

The selection criteria for the central-central control sample are listed
in Table 6.6 . For this sample a @xmath candidate is required to have
two central electrons, one passing the tight cuts, and the other the
loose cuts (Table 6.1 ). The mass of the Z candidate is required to be
within the window 66 GeV to 116 GeV. The difference in the @xmath
coordinates of the two electron tracks must be less than 4 cm. We find
@xmath opposite-sign events and @xmath same-sign central-central @xmath
events satisfying these criteria (the large number of same-sign events
in the electron sample but not in the muon sample is largely due to
photon conversions - see Chapter 10 ).

The distributions in mass, @xmath of the pair, and @xmath are shown in
Figure 6.2 . To normalize the MC sample, we used the measured @xmath ( )
@xmath BR [ 62 ] .

#### 6.2.2 The Central-Plug Control Sample

We also form a central-plug dielectron @xmath control sample to monitor
the identification performance for the electrons in end-plug
calorimeters. We require a tight central electron, and a plug electron
passing the cuts of Table 6.4 . The mass of the Z candidate is required
to be within the window 66 GeV to 116 GeV. We find @xmath ( @xmath )
central-plug @xmath events satisfying these criteria with the plug
electron in the East (West) calorimeter.

The distributions in mass, @xmath of the pair, and @xmath are shown in
Figure 6.3 . The comparison of data vs MC is shown in Table 6.8 . The
event yields are shown in Figure 6.4 .

#### 6.2.3 The Control Sample

The selection criteria for the control sample are listed in Table 6.7 .
We require one tight central electron (i.e. @xmath GeV), and corrected
(Section 8.1 ) greater than @xmath GeV. We require the transverse mass
of the W candidate to be in the mass window 20-140 GeV. We find @xmath
events, @xmath positive and @xmath negative W’s. The event yields are
shown in Figure 6.4 .

#### 6.2.4 Summary of the Electron Control Sample Event Counts and
Stability Plots

We use the control samples of and decays to check temporal stability of
the event yields (Figure 6.4 ). Table 6.8 presents summary of the
electron control sample event counts.

## Chapter 7 Photon Identification

The photon selection criteria are identical for photons in both the muon
and electron samples; the photon cuts, and the number of events passing
in each sample, are enumerated in Table 7.2 and are described below.

A sample of photons from events used to measure the probability of an
electron radiating an energetic photon is also introduced.

### 7.1 Photon Selection Criteria

A photon candidate is required to have corrected transverse energy
greater than 25 GeV. For photons or electrons the CES shower position is
determined by the energy-weighted centroid of the highest energy
clusters of those strips and wires in the CES which correspond to the
seed tower. The direction of the photon is determined by the line
connecting the primary event vertex to the shower position in the CES.
To ensure that events are well-measured the shower position of the
photon is required to fall within the fiducial region of the CES so that
the shower is fully contained in the active region.

Photon candidates are required to have characteristics consistent with
those of a neutral electromagnetically-interacting particle. No COT
track with @xmath 1 GeV may point at the photon cluster. One track with
@xmath 1 GeV may point at the cluster.

The variable ‘Iso @xmath ’ is the Run I cone @xmath isolation energy
with the Run I correction to isolation energy due to phi-crack leakage [
65 ] . The tracking isolation variable ‘Track Isolation’ is the sum of
the @xmath of tracks in a in a cone in @xmath space of radius @xmath
surrounding the photon, measured in GeV.

Table 7.2 summarizes the selection of photons in the muon and electron
subsamples (Section 4.1 ).

For the muon subsample we require the event to be triggered by either a
high- @xmath muon trigger (which is MUON_CMUP_18 or MUON_CMX_18) or by a
high- @xmath photon trigger (PHOTON_25_ISO). After requiring a Tight
muon (Table 5.1 ) to be in the event with the photon (Table 7.1 ) we
find a total of @xmath @xmath candidate events.

For the electron subsample we require event to be triggered by either
high- @xmath electron trigger (ELECTRON_CENTRAL_18) or by high- @xmath
photon trigger (PHOTON_25_ISO). After requiring a tight electron(Table
6.1 ) to be in the event with the photon(Table 7.1 ) we find a total of
@xmath @xmath candidate events. The disparity between this number and
the @xmath @xmath events is due to a number of causes, in particular
hard photon bremsstrahlung of an electron, as discussed later in Section
7.2 .

### 7.2 Introducing the Photon Control Sample

Unlike for the electron or muon, finding a pure sample of high-Pt
photons is difficult; the ‘Compton’ sample of @xmath -jet events has QCD
fake backgrounds, for example. We describe here a control sample of
high-Pt photons derived from the @xmath .

In looking for photons in the electron sample, one has to take into
account that the dominant source of fake background for @xmath events is
@xmath production, wherein one of the electrons undergoes hard photon
bremsstrahlung in the detector material, or the COT fails to detect one
of the electron tracks, and that electron subsequently passes all of the
photon cuts. There are approximately @xmath tight central electron pairs
in the CDF data, so a photon fake rate as low as @xmath will give rise
to @xmath @xmath background events, which would be unacceptably high for
finding sources of new physics comparable to @xmath production. The Run
II detector has significantly more material inside the outer tracking
chamber than the Run I detector had, and so the number of ‘ @xmath ‘
events from production will be significantly higher. We measure this
fake rate directly from the data (the material in simulated data is
underestimated, see Table 6.8 ).

A control sample of @xmath -like events, @xmath , is selected from the
@xmath two-body @xmath candidates (see Chapter 12 ) by requiring that
the invariant mass of the @xmath pair, @xmath , be within 10 GeV of the
@xmath mass (91 GeV). There are @xmath such events in the CDF data. It
is observed that the shapes of the distributions of the two samples (
and @xmath ) are similar to each other(Figure 7.1 ).

## Chapter 8 Calculating the Missing Transverse Energy and @xmath

This chapter describes how missing transverse energy ( ) is calculated,
and gives the definition and describes calculation of the total
transverse energy.

### 8.1 Calculating the

Missing transverse energy ( ) is associated with particles that escape
detection. For example, is the signature of weakly interacting neutral
particles such as neutrinos, or possible new particles such as the
gravitino or LSP. It also can come from mismeasurement of the true
@xmath of objects, or from backgrounds such as cosmic rays or beam halo.

Missing @xmath ( @xmath ) is defined by @xmath , where i is the
calorimeter tower number for @xmath 3.6, and @xmath is a unit vector
perpendicular to the beam axis and pointing at the i @xmath tower. We
define the magnitude @xmath .

Corrections are made to the for non-uniform calorimeter response [ 56 ]
for jets with uncorrected @xmath @xmath and @xmath , and for muons with
@xmath @xmath :

-   Muons:
    – correct for @xmath , where @xmath is a transverse energy deposited
    in electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters, and @xmath is a
    transverse momentum of a muon track. We correct for all muons with
    @xmath GeV.

-   Jets:
    – correct for @xmath , where @xmath is a transverse energy of an
    uncorrected jet, and @xmath is a transverse energy of a jet,
    corrected for non-uniform calorimeter response. We correct for jets
    with @xmath GeV.

When identifying jets we check that jet object does not have any of the
objects identified in the current analysis close to it (within @xmath
0.5).

For the @xmath analysis we set the cut on to be @xmath GeV.

### 8.2 Calculating the Total Transverse Energy

Total transverse energy @xmath is defined for each event as the sum of
the transverse energies of the leptons, photons, jets, and that pass the
analysis selection criteria. To calculate @xmath we use Tight and Loose
Central Electrons (Table 6.1 ), Tight Phoenix Electrons (Table 6.2 ),
Tight and Loose CMUP and CMX muons, Stubless muons (Table 5.1 ), , and
jets in the event with @xmath and @xmath .

## Chapter 9 Standard Model Predictions

The dominant source of @xmath events at the Tevatron is electroweak
diboson production (Figure 9.1 ), in which an electroweak boson ( @xmath
or @xmath ) decays leptonically ( @xmath or @xmath ) and a photon is
radiated from either an initial state quark, a charged electroweak boson
( @xmath ), or a final state lepton. The number of @xmath events from
electroweak diboson production is estimated using several leading-order
(LO) Monte Carlo (MC) event generator programs. These programs are
MadGraph [ 68 ] , CompHep [ 69 ] , and Baur [ 70 , 71 ] .

These programs output 4-vectors and helicities of particles emanating
from a diboson production event in an ASCII format. In addition the
information on how the particles are produced (“mother” and “daughter”)
is recorded, including the energy scale and other parameters used for
the matrix element calculation.

These files are then fed into the LesHouchesModule [ 72 ] , which runs
Pythia [ 73 ] to add parton fragmentation and final-state radiation and
initial-state radiation (both QED and QCD) , and then writes out the
events in CDF HEPG format. These files are then used as input to the CDF
detector simulation program. This program outputs simulated data in a
format identical to that of an actual CDF Run II event. Simulated @xmath
event rates are then estimated in a manner identical to that of CDF
data.

### 9.1 @xmath, @xmath, @xmath and @xmath MC Sets

The details on the generator level settings of the Baur [ 71 ] MC @xmath
, @xmath datasets can be found in Ref. [ 74 ] .

The MadGraph @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath datasets created for this
analysis are listed in Table 9.3 . Details on the MadGraph and CompHep
MC samples can be found in Ref. [ 75 , 76 ] .

The kinematic cuts used for the generation of @xmath , @xmath , @xmath
and @xmath MC Sets are listed in Table 9.1 .

To account for NLO corrections to the @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath
processes we use the @xmath -dependent K-factor= @xmath obtained using
Baur’s NLO calculation programs [ 77 ] .

We apply these corrections to our LO MC(MadGraph and Baur). For @xmath
and @xmath we used the same K-factor formulas as for @xmath and @xmath ,
respectively.

Since the Baur NLO program only considers the @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
channel contributions and not the bremstrahlung off the lepton lines(in
this case on the generator level @xmath , @xmath ) we apply the
inclusive W cross-section K-factor of 1.36 to the W+photon processes.

The K-factor applied to @xmath and @xmath MadGraph MC samples is shown
in Equation LABEL:kfactor_wgwgg.equation . The K-factor applied to
@xmath and @xmath MadGraph MC samples is shown in Equation
LABEL:kfactor_zgzgg.equation . In the Equations
LABEL:kfactor_wgwgg.equation and LABEL:kfactor_zgzgg.equation @xmath (
@xmath ) is the mass of the generated W(Z) system , and @xmath is a
(generated) photon transverse energy.

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Every MC event is weighted with the appropriate K-factor.

### 9.2 Checks

To be highly confident in the SM predictions, we compared the
predictions from the three independent LO matrix-element generators at
generator and HEPG level.

There is excellent agreement (within 10% or within statistics) between
MadGraph and CompHep in all channels. As the two generators are really
different in technique (a helicity amplitude calculation in MadGraph, as
opposed to the symbolic evaluation of squared matrix element in
CompHep), this gives us confidence in the predictions.

Figure 9.2 shows the integrated cross section versus @xmath of the
photon for the MadGraph and CompHep @xmath and @xmath samples [ 75 , 76
] . Figure 9.3 shows the integrated cross section versus @xmath of the
photon for the MadGraph and CompHep @xmath and @xmath samples [ 75 , 76
] .

We have compared MadGraph, CompHep and MadGraph samples at GENERATOR [
75 ] and HEPG [ 78 ] . The more detailed study for MadGraph and Baur
@xmath and @xmath samples have been performed at Ref. [ 79 , 80 ] . For
example, the distributions for the muon channel is shown in Figure 9.4 .

### 9.3 The SM Diboson @xmath and @xmath Processes as Sources of
Lepton-Photon Events

The @xmath channel was the main SM contributor to the @xmath signature
with the Run I cuts [ 29 ] . In the Run I analysis, @xmath was expected
to contribute @xmath events to the @xmath channel, out of a total of
@xmath , and @xmath , out of a total of @xmath for the @xmath channel.
Having a reliable prediction of this signature is crucial.

The photon can be radiated from the incoming quarks, from the outgoing
electron, or the intermediate W (Figure 9.1 ). More detail on the
kinematic distributions and the cross sections is available in Ref [ 75
] . Initial-state radiation is simulated by the pythia MC program [ 73 ]
tuned to reproduce the underlying event. The generated particles are
then passed through a full detector simulation, and these events are
then reconstructed with the same code used for the data.

The predicted numbers of detected @xmath and @xmath events in @xmath
from SM @xmath production satisfying the analysis cuts from MadGraph are
given in Table 9.4 .

The uncertainties on the SM contributions include those from parton
distribution functions (5%), factorization scale (2%), K-factor (3%), a
comparison of different MC generators ( @xmath 5%), and the luminosity
(6%) (Chapter 11 ).

We have studied predictions from MadGraph, CompHep and Baur generators
for data and MC reconstructed in Ref. [ 78 ] , and these studies showed
good agreement in predicted rates.

The process @xmath is also one of the major SM backgrounds for the
lepton+ photon+X searches. It is the largest contributor to the
inclusive multi-body category in the Run I search, with expected
contributions in 86 @xmath of 5.01 @xmath 0.54 events in the @xmath mode
and 4.60 @xmath 0.54 in the @xmath mode [ 2 ] . It is also significant
in the @xmath channel, especially for muons, as one muon can be missed
inducing . The expected contributions for the electron and muon channels
in Run I were @xmath and @xmath events, respectively, smaller than the
@xmath contributions, but still significant, with a total ( @xmath ) of
@xmath events out of the @xmath events expected in 86 @xmath .

The photon can be radiated from the incoming quarks or from the outgoing
electron (Figure 9.1 ). More detail on the kinematic distributions and
the cross sections is available in Ref [ 75 ] .

The predicted numbers of detected (inclusive) @xmath and @xmath events
in @xmath from SM @xmath production satisfying the analysis cuts from
MadGraph are given in Table 9.5 . The uncertainties on the SM
contributions include those from parton distribution functions (7%), a
comparison of different MC generators ( @xmath 5%), and the luminosity
(6%) (Chapter 11 ).

### 9.4 The SM Triboson @xmath and @xmath Processes as Sources of
Lepton-Photon Events

While small, the @xmath , @xmath processes are the largest true SM
sources of a signature of a high- @xmath lepton plus two photons. The
observation of several such events has motivated a careful study of the
cross-sections for these sources [ 75 ] . In this study we have used
both MadGraph and Comphep; we get excellent agreement between the two
generators (Figure 9.3 ), giving us confidence in the predictions.

The final state of one lepton and two photons, @xmath , is produced in
the SM through an intermediate W, with radiation off of any of the
charged lines in the diagrams. We denote the final state of @xmath as ‘
@xmath ’ for convenience, although the @xmath is virtual and the
kinematics of the final state are more complicated than the name would
suggest. Note that this is process has three spin-one bosons in the
final state; MadGraph treats the helicities correctly and writes them
into the output file as input to the next steps.

The predicted numbers of detected @xmath and @xmath events in @xmath
from SM @xmath production satisfying the analysis cuts from MadGraph are
given in Table 9.6 . The agreement on the generator level for @xmath
between the two monte carlos, CompHep and MadGraph is good (Figure 9.3
), and we will use MadGraph @xmath to get predicted rates. More details,
including kinematic distributions, can be found in Ref. [ 75 ] .

The final state of two leptons and two photons, @xmath , is generated
through the intermediate photon and @xmath states, with radiation off of
any of the charged lines in the diagrams. We denote this as ‘ @xmath ’
for convenience, but the two amplitudes modify the mass spectra and
angular distributions, and so are both important.

This process is one of the SM mechanisms that could produce the @xmath
event [ 28 ] (although with an extra two jets), and is of interest in
the dilepton-diphoton searches as a background. As one can see below the
SM cross sections are small, typically one femtobarn or less.

The predicted numbers of detected @xmath and @xmath events in @xmath
from SM @xmath production satisfying the analysis cuts from MadGraph are
given in Table 9.6 . The agreement on the generator level for @xmath
between the two monte carlos, CompHep and MadGraph is good (Figure 9.3
), and we will use MadGraph @xmath to get predicted rates. More details,
including kinematic distributions, can be found in Ref. [ 75 ] .

### 9.5 The Sum of Contributions for SM @xmath, @xmath, @xmath, @xmath
Processes

Table 9.7 gives the sum of the expected contributions to the @xmath and
@xmath channels from SM @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath processes.
We have multiplied the average LO predictions for each channel by the
K-factors listed in Equations LABEL:kfactor_wgwgg.equation and
LABEL:kfactor_zgzgg.equation . As we require the event to be triggered
either by the lepton or by the photon trigger, this combination of
triggers is fully efficient.

### 9.6 @xmath and @xmath Followed by or @xmath and @xmath or @xmath

The last SM direct contribution (as opposed to misidentification) we
consider is @xmath and @xmath production followed by the boson leptonic
decay in the @xmath channel(“ @xmath background”). The tau can then
decay into an electron or muon. These events are not fakes, in the sense
that the electron or muon is real, although not a direct product of the
vector boson decay.

Table 9.8 gives a summary of the contributions to the @xmath and @xmath
channels from @xmath events ( @xmath and @xmath decaying to taus). Shown
are numbers of expected tau events from different processes ( @xmath ,
@xmath ) making a signature of @xmath , @xmath and @xmath for the
different categories defined in the analysis. The final lepton is either
an electron or muon.

Background from @xmath , where @xmath ( @xmath 1/4 of the @xmath
branching fraction), then @xmath , which could mimic a single track +
photon signature that looks like @xmath is a part of @xmath background
estimated.

## Chapter 10 Backgrounds: Fakes

In addition to the expectations from real SM processes that produce real
@xmath events described in Chapter 9 , there are backgrounds due to
misidentified leptons and photons, and also incorrectly calculated . We
generically call these misidentifications ‘fakes’. In this chapter we
first treat backgrounds from fake photons, then from fake leptons,
including backgrounds to the W samples due to events with a fake lepton
and false .

### 10.1 Fake Photons

We consider two sources of fake photons: QCD jets in which a neutral
hadron or photon from hadron decay mimics a direct photon, and electron
bremsstrahlung, in which an energetic photon is radiated off of an
electron which is then much lower energy and curls away from the photon.

#### 10.1.1 Fake Photons from Jets

High @xmath photons are copiously created from hadron decays in jets
initiated by a scattered quark or gluon. In particular, mesons such as
the @xmath or @xmath decay to photons which may satisfy the photon
selection criteria.

The number of lepton-plus-misidentified-jet events in the @xmath and
@xmath samples is determined by measuring the jet @xmath spectrum in
@xmath jet and @xmath jet samples, respectively, and then multiplying by
the probability of a jet being misidentified as a photon, @xmath . The
uncertainty on the number of such events is calculated by again using
the measured jet spectrum and the upper and lower bounds on the @xmath
-dependent misidentification rate. An overview of the fake rate method
is given in Ref. [ 41 ] .

Any photon that is due the decay of a meson ( @xmath , @xmath ) is
classified as FAKE and any photon that is created in the hard scattering
process or radiated off a quark is classified as a TRUE photon. The
strategy is first to measure the RAW fake rate. The fraction of jets
which are matched to a photon candidate

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

We estimate TRUE fake as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

To distinguish @xmath from @xmath or other hadrons, the following
variables have been used in the jet fake rate studies:

-   CES @xmath
    – @xmath typically have higher @xmath than prompt photons

-   Isolation in a cone in @xmath space of radius R=0.4 around the
    @xmath candidate
    – the background is usually produced as a part of a jet @xmath
    @xmath is higher than for @xmath

-   Hit rate in the CPR (Central Preradiator Detector, see Section 2.2.3
    )
    – CPR is between solenoid and calorimeter. @xmath converts in the
    coil and therefore we measure charge. Photons and fakes have
    different conversion probabilities.

Technical details on the studies of jets faking photons in CDF II are
available in Ref. [ 81 ] . The most recent numbers are available in Ref.
[ 41 ] and resulting distribution for @xmath and @xmath are shown in
Figure 10.2 . We follow this study closely in our estimates. We use jets
from the inclusive high- @xmath muon and high- @xmath electron lepton
samples (Section 4.1 ) to evaluate the background from jets faking
photons.

The above studies show that the (fake) photon carries about 94% of the
jet @xmath , and the resolution on the photon @xmath is about 5%. We
consequently scale and smear the jet @xmath by these numbers to get the
@xmath of the fake photon. We then select jets with @xmath and @xmath 25
GeV after the scaling and smearing. The jets are then weighted with by
the jet fake rate [ 81 ] .

The number of fake events versus the @xmath of the fake photon are shown
in Figure 10.3 for the @xmath and @xmath samples in both the electron
and muon channels. We count lepton-‘fake photon‘ candidates in the same
way as we do for real photons to calculate background for each
subcategory. Table 10.1 summarizes the number of events in the @xmath
and @xmath samples for the sub-categories used in the analysis.

#### 10.1.2 Fake Photons from Electron Bremsstrahlung

We can measure the probability that a high- @xmath electron ‘brems’ an
energetic photon in the material before the COT tracking volume in such
a way that it fakes a photon, by using the @xmath as a source of
‘tagged’ electrons. We look for a back-to-back @xmath pair close to the
@xmath mass ( @xmath and @xmath ) - this is the sub-category labeled
‘Z-like’. For the @xmath sample the requirements are an exactly 1
electron and 1 photon, with @xmath and @xmath . From the number of these
events and the number of events we can measure the probability per ‘leg’
of a @xmath that an electron is misidentified as a photon. We require
both electrons in to be central and pass tight cuts, so that the
kinematic requirements will be the same as for the @xmath sample (i.e.
two tight central electromagnetic objects).

The events in the 2nd row (labeled as ) of the Table 10.2 have the same
signature as @xmath events (see Figure 12.1 ), but instead of a photon
we require a tight central electron(Table 6.3 ).

For instance, to estimate contribution from electron faking photon to
@xmath category we count events with ee+ (both electrons are tight
central, Table 6.3 ). For Multi-Lepton + Photon we count events with
three electrons, of which two electrons should be tight central, and the
third one can be tight or loose central (Table 6.1 ), or phoenix tight
(Table 6.2 ). Finally, for Multi-Photon + Lepton category we use @xmath
events, both electrons are Tight Central.

Using the numbers in Table 10.2 we calculate the background from
electrons misidentified as photons. For example, for @xmath subcategory
the estimated number of electron-fake-photon events(“ @xmath ”) is
calculated as follows:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

-   @xmath @xmath events in the sample

-   @xmath @xmath @xmath -like events

-   @xmath @xmath @xmath -like events expected from diboson events(
    @xmath , @xmath )

-   @xmath @xmath + jet faking photon @xmath -like events expected from
    misidentified jets

-   @xmath events (81 GeV @xmath 101 GeV, @xmath 150)

We take all numbers from data, with the exception that we get number of
@xmath events expected from diboson events, @xmath and @xmath , from MC
(we take into account contribution from @xmath and @xmath , although
it’s @xmath 1% of that from @xmath and @xmath ).

Finally, we estimate the number of electron-fake-photon events in @xmath
to be

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

Table 10.2 summarizes the calculated number of events in each analysis
subcategory for electrons faking photons by catastrophic bremsstrahlung.
The upper three rows are the input numbers used in the calculation,
which is given by Equation 10.3 . The last row gives the estimated
number of events detected with fake photons from electron
bremsstrahlung.

### 10.2 QCD (’Non-W/Z’) Backgrounds

To measure the QCD backgrounds from fake leptons and or fake , we form a
‘non-W/Z’ sample we expect to have very little real lepton content [ 82
] by selecting on loose leptons, rejecting events from the W or Z.

To estimate Non-W/Z background we use four samples:

-    Non-W/Z sample : 1 @xmath + jet(s), no W or Z candidates

-    Signal Sample : @xmath or @xmath

-    Golden-Lepton : tight e’s, CC ; tight @xmath ’s

-    Jet Faking Photon : @xmath or @xmath

In these samples we define three track isolation regions:

-    Track-Isolated : 0 GeV @xmath Track Isolation @xmath 2 GeV

-    Non-Track-Isolated : Track Isolation @xmath 4 GeV

-    Intermediate : 2 GeV @xmath Track Isolation @xmath 4 GeV

The procedure we use is to:

-   Estimate fraction of golden leptons with bad track isolation

-   Estimate fraction of non-W/Z leptons with good track isolation

-   Estimate QCD(Jet faking lepton and ) background

-   Vary track isolation regions to get systematics

We describe the selection and the procedure in detail below. We define
’Non-W/Z’ sample in Section 10.2.1 . We describe the basic method in
Section 10.2.2 , and then modify it to avoid double counting and to
include systematics in Section 10.2.4 . We estimate QCD (non-W/Z)
background for and in Section 10.2.5 to make sure we obtain results
consistent with Ref. [ 62 ] .

#### 10.2.1 Non-W/Z Sample

To select an event for the Non-W/Z sample we require the event to have
no W or Z candidates. Therefore, we require the event to have exactly
one tight lepton and no additional loose leptons or @xmath . We also
require the event to have at least one hadronic jet. For the electron
Non-W/Z sample the jet is required to have EM Fraction @xmath 0.8,
@xmath , @xmath GeV. For the muon Non-W/Z sample the jet is required to
have 0.1 @xmath EM Fraction @xmath 0.9, @xmath , @xmath GeV.

To reject events in which one muon is not identified, events with a
second track with @xmath GeV and associated EM and HAD calorimeter
energies less than 3 and 9 GeV, respectively, are rejected (we used the
same requirements to select control sample in Section 5.2.2 ).

#### 10.2.2 Track Isolation Method

To calculate the backgrounds from fake W’s and fake Z’s in which the
lepton comes from a jet, we use the track isolation of the lepton and
the samples of good electrons from Z’s and QCD background from the
non-WZ sample described above. The procedure is as follows:

-   Assume W, Z, @xmath , @xmath all have the same underlying event
    structure, including jets (good assumption to first order in the SM,
    see for example Figure 10.6 ).

-   Define 3 samples:

    -   @xmath or @xmath (signal region)

    -   golden-lepton (tight central-central electrons , tight muons )

    -   Non-W/Z QCD background

-    [0] @xmath : Number of events in a signal sample
    Count @xmath events of @xmath ( @xmath )

-    [1] @xmath : fraction of golden leptons with bad track isolation
    From the golden-lepton sample find the fraction @xmath of golden
    leptons that have bad track isolation (tiso @xmath 4).

-    [2] @xmath : number of signal in a @xmath region
    @xmath represents the number of real electrons we will lose by
    subtracting off electrons with tiso @xmath 4 in the @xmath ( @xmath
    ) sample. This has an uncertainty ( @xmath ) @xmath
    @xmath

-    [3] @xmath : ratio of background with good track isolation to the
    bad track isolation
    From the non-WZ sample find the ratio @xmath of background with good
    track tiso ( @xmath ) to those with bad track tiso ( @xmath ). We
    use this to estimate how many of the tiso @xmath 2 candidates are
    really QCD background.
    @xmath

-    [4] @xmath : the number of background with @xmath
    From the @xmath ( @xmath ) sample, the number of background with
    tiso @xmath 4 should be the number of candidates with tiso @xmath 4
    minus the expected number of real electrons with tiso @xmath 4:
    @xmath

-    [5] @xmath : the number of background with @xmath
    The number of background with @xmath is
    @xmath

-    [6] @xmath : the number of background with @xmath
    From number of background in @xmath @xmath and number of events in
    Non-WZ sample with @xmath and @xmath we estimate number of
    background with @xmath . The number of background with @xmath is
    @xmath

-    [7] @xmath : QCD background
    Resulting Number of QCD background
    @xmath

#### 10.2.3 Non-W/Z Results

We have used track isolation to make estimates of the non-W backgrounds
in the control sample (Section 10.2.5 ).

Table 10.3 summarizes the numbers of track-isolated and
non-track-isolated events in the good electron, non-WZ, and signal
samples. In addition, we add numbers of events from W+jet and Z+jet
categories, used to estimate jet faking photon background.

The good electrons are heavily track-isolated ( @xmath ); the QCD
background ‘electrons’ are predominantly track-non-isolated ( @xmath ).

Table 10.6 shows step-by-step calculation of predicted QCD (Non-WZ)
backgrounds.

#### 10.2.4 Modified Track Isolation Method

From the jet fake rate we obtain (fake gamma + real W) and (fake gamma +
fake W) backgrounds. From Track Isolation Method we obtain (real gamma +
fake W) and possibly (fake gamma + fake W).

To summarize, there are three sources of faking @xmath with either fake
gamma and/or fake W:

1.  fake gamma + real W (from jet fake rate)

2.  fake gamma + fake W (also part of jet fake rate and possibly part of
    non-W/Z background)

3.  real gamma + fake W (from non-W/Z background)

If fake W is a part of non-W/Z background it should contribute to
track-non-isolated regions. Real W’s from W+jet should have the same
track isolation distribution as W+ @xmath (we have performed the checks
for all the samples we use, see for example Figure 10.6 ).

To avoid double counting, we modify Track Isolation Method as follows:
we subtract W+jet faking photon contribution from @xmath trackiso
regions, we subtract Z+jet faking photon contribution from @xmath
trackiso regions. Then we repeat procedure, documented in Section 10.2.2
, with these modified @xmath and @xmath numbers (Table 10.6 ).

To take into account systematic error of 100% for jet faking photon rate
(Table 10.6 ) we repeat these procedure, subtracting W+jet and Z+jet
contribution multiplied by 2. Therefore, to avoid double-counting we use
background estimates from “Predicted QCD Backgrounds with Jet Fakes
Subtracted” (Table 10.6 ).

Finally, Non-W/Z backgrounds for @xmath and @xmath signatures are
summarized in Table 10.7 . Systematic errors are obtained by varying
track isolation regions. Further checks for Non-WZ background for and
are described below in Section 10.2.5 .

#### 10.2.5 Non-W/Z background for and

We have used track isolation to make estimates of the non-WZ backgrounds
in the control sample and @xmath and @xmath signal samples. Table 10.8
shows the estimated ‘non-W’ background in the W samples for 5 different
track-iso regions. This is for a check- the values are consistent with
known QCD backgrounds for W’s [ 62 ] . The method uses track isolation
and two regions, one at low track-iso and one at high. Leptons from the
golden Z sample are used to estimate the number of leptons in the
high-track-iso region; ‘leptons’ from the non-WZ sample are used to
estimate the number of leptons in the low-track-iso region. The first
column of the table gives the ranges in GeV for the low and high
track-iso regions, respectively.

## Chapter 11 Systematic Uncertainties

In this chapter we summarize estimates of the systematic uncertainties
on the SM predicted rates and on the measured event counts.

The errors are categorised as theoretical (Section 11.1 ), luminosity
(Section 11.2 ) and experimental (Section 11.3 . The contributing
effects for the SM predictions we have considered are:

-   7% error is on the total theoretical prediction, including the NLO
    uncertainties.

-   Luminosity: 6%

-   Trigger Efficiencies: 2% for muons and 1% for electrons for lepton
    triggers only. We OR’ing lepton trigger with photon trigger, and
    therefore this combination of triggers is fully efficient.

-   @xmath z_vert @xmath @xmath 60: 1%

-   Muon ID Efficiencies: 2%

-   Electron ID Efficiencies: 1%

-   Photons ID Efficiencies: 4%

The systematic uncertainties on the backgrounds are included in the
background estimates, discussed in Chapter 9 and Chapter 10 . For the SM
predictions the total systematic uncertainty is 10.2% for @xmath and
@xmath for electrons, and 10.5% for @xmath and @xmath for muons (Chapter
9 ).

### 11.1 Theoretical Systematic Uncertainties

Limitations in the theoretical precision of the calculation, result in
an uncertainty on the cross-section prediction. The effect of these
errors on the cross-section is studied in [ 7 , 41 , 83 ] and is
summarized in Table 11.1

#### 11.1.1 Factorization Scale

The factorization scale is the minimum @xmath value calculated [ 41 , 83
] for photon emission in the ZGAMMA and WGAMMA programs [ 70 ] . This
value will affect the maximum @xmath value for post generation Pythia
fragmentation. The default factorization scale was @xmath , the square
of the collision energy of the event. The cross-section and acceptance
were measured using four other values, 2 @xmath , 3/2 @xmath , 2/3
@xmath and 1/2 @xmath . The greatest variation in the cross-section from
the default value of Q2 was 2%.

#### 11.1.2 Parton Density Function Choice

Protons and anti-protons are composite particles. Therefore, any
interactions between them must be described using parton density
functions (PDF). The PDF describes the energy distributions of the
valence quarks, gluons and sea quarks inside the proton/anti-proton.

The PDF chosen for use with ZGAMMA [ 70 ] was the CTEQ5L PDF. In order
to determine the systematic error from this choice, the LO cross-section
is compared to the corresponding predictions calculated from the MRST 72
- 76 PDFs. The MRST cross-sections range between 1.604 and 1.625 @xmath
whereas the cross-section using CTEQ5L is 1.72 @xmath . The difference
between the two was taken to be the systematic error [ 41 , 83 ] , of
6%.

#### 11.1.3 K-factor

The calculated K-factor only takes into account O( @xmath ) corrections.
To take into account higher order corrections, the Q scale in the NLO
calculation was varied by factors of 2 and 1/2. A 3% variation in the
cross-section calculation was observed, and taken to be a systematic
error.

### 11.2 Luminosity Systematic Uncertainties

The luminosity error is estimated to be 6%, which includes a 4.4%
contribution from the acceptance and operation of the luminosity monitor
and 4.0% from the theoretical uncertainty on the calculation of the
total @xmath cross-section [ 49 ] .

### 11.3 Experimental Systematic Uncertainties

The sources of experimental systematic errors [ 7 , 41 , 83 ] for the
@xmath analysis subcategories are summarized in Table 11.2 . Jet Fake
systematic error is discussed in Section 10.1.1 .

Systematic uncertainty on jet faking photon rate is one of the
dominating errors. The uncertainty is limited by the statistics for the
high- @xmath photons, so we expect it to significantly improve with more
data. At that point we’ll be dominated by the systematic uncertainty.
Therefore, the biggest contribution will be from the SM estimates on
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath production.

## Chapter 12 The @xmath Search

This chapter presents the results of the @xmath search for the three
signatures of interest - @xmath , @xmath and @xmath .

Section 12.1 describes the ‘analysis subcategories’ established in the
Run I analysis [ 2 ] , and used again here so as to be a priori .
Section 12.2 presents the number of events in each analysis subcategory
for the @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath (the sum of @xmath ) samples.
Section 12.3 discusses the stability of the observed numbers during the
course of the run. The predicted and observed totals for the @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath and comparison of observed kinematic distributions to
the SM predicted shapes is done in Section 12.4 .

### 12.1 Defining the Event Categories by Topology

Categories of photon-lepton events were defined a priori in a way that
characterized the different possibilities for new physics. For each
category, the inclusive event total and basic kinematic distributions
can be compared with standard model expectations. The decay products of
massive particles are typically isolated from other particles, and
possess large transverse momentum and low rapidity.

Therefore, inclusive @xmath events are selected by requiring a central
tight photon with @xmath @xmath and a central @xmath or @xmath with
@xmath @xmath . Both signal and control samples are drawn from this
@xmath sample (Figures 12.3 , 12.1 and 12.2 ).

Considering the control samples first, from the @xmath sample we select
back-to-back events with exactly one photon and one lepton (i.e. @xmath
); this is the dominant contribution to the @xmath sample, and has a
large Drell-Yan component. A subset of this sample is the ‘Z-like’
sample, which provides the calibration for the probability that an
electron radiates and is detected as a photon, as discussed in Section
10.1.2 . The remaining back-to-back events are called the Two-Body
Events and were not used in this analysis.

All events which either have more than one lepton or photon, or in which
the lepton and photon are not back-to-back (and hence the event cannot
be a Two-Body event), are classified as ‘Inclusive Multi-Body @xmath ’.
These are further subdivided into three categories: @xmath (Section 12.5
) (‘Multi-Body @xmath Events’), for which the (Section 8.1 ) is greater
than 25 GeV , @xmath (Section 12.6 ) and @xmath (Section 12.7 )
(‘Multi-Photon and Multi-Lepton Events’), and events with exactly one
lepton and exactly one photon, which are not back-to-back. The events
with exactly one lepton and exactly one photon, which are not
back-to-back were not used in the analysis.

### 12.2 The Number of Events Observed

Figure 12.1 shows the results of this classification for the inclusive
electron data sample. We find @xmath @xmath events, of which @xmath are
in the Inclusive Multi-Body category. Of these, @xmath are classified as
@xmath events and @xmath and @xmath as Multi-Photon and Multi-Electron
events respectively.

Figure 12.2 shows the results for the inclusive muon sample.We find
@xmath @xmath events, of which @xmath are in the Inclusive Multi-Body
category. Of these, @xmath are classified as @xmath events and @xmath
and @xmath as Multi-Photon and Multi-Muon events.

Figure 12.3 shows the sum of the electron and muon entries in the
analysis subcategories. There are @xmath @xmath events, @xmath
Multi-Photon events, and @xmath Multi-Lepton events. It is these
categories, shown in red in the figures, that are of particular interest
due to the Run I results.

### 12.3 Stability of the Event Rates versus Run Number

This sub-section looks at the rate for the analysis subcategories as a
function of run number. We use the same eight luminosity bins used to
check the stability of the control samples, described in Section 4.1 .
We see no obvious problems, although the statistics are low. Figure 12.4
shows the rates in events/ @xmath for the @xmath and @xmath signal
subcategories in each run segment in the muon channel; Figure 12.5 does
the same for the electron channel.

### 12.4 Results

In this section we summarize the predicted and observed totals for the
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath searches. We compare observed kinematic
distributions to the SM predicted shapes.

### 12.5 @xmath Search

The predicted and observed totals for the @xmath search are shown in
Table 12.1 . We observe @xmath @xmath events compared to the expectation
of @xmath events.

There is no significant excess in the @xmath signature. Figure 12.6
shows the observed distributions summed over the @xmath and @xmath
events in a) the @xmath of the photon; b) the @xmath of the lepton; c)
the missing transverse energy, ; and d) the transverse mass of the
@xmath system, where @xmath - @xmath .

The predicted and observed kinematic distributions for @xmath are
compared in Figure 12.7 . The distributions for @xmath signature are
compared in Figure 12.8 .

The additional plots of the identification variables for @xmath and
@xmath are available in Section A.2 .

### 12.6 @xmath Search

The predicted and observed totals for the @xmath search are shown in
Table 12.2 . We observe @xmath @xmath events compared to the expectation
of @xmath events.

The @xmath search criteria select @xmath events ( @xmath @xmath and
@xmath @xmath ) of the @xmath @xmath events. No @xmath events are
observed. Figure 12.9 shows the observed distributions in a) the @xmath
of the photon; b) the @xmath of the leptons; c) the 2-body mass of the
dilepton system; and d) the 3-body mass @xmath . For the @xmath process
occurring via initial state radiation, the dilepton invariant mass
@xmath distribution is peaked around the @xmath -pole. For the final
state radiation, the three body invariant mass @xmath distribution is
peaked about the @xmath -pole.

The predicted and observed kinematic distributions for @xmath are
compared in Figure 12.10 . The distributions for @xmath signature are
compared in Figure 12.11 . The dominant contribution for the @xmath and
@xmath signatures is from the SM @xmath production.

We do not expect events with large in the @xmath sample, based on the SM
backgrounds; the Run I @xmath event was of special interest in the
context of supersymmetry [ 18 , 19 ] due to the large value of (55
@xmath 7 @xmath ). Figure 12.12 shows the distributions in for the
@xmath and @xmath subsamples of the @xmath sample. No events are
observed with @xmath @xmath .

The additional plots of the identification variables for @xmath and
@xmath are available in Section A.3 .

### 12.7 @xmath Search

The predicted and observed totals for the @xmath search are shown in
Table 12.3 . We do not observe any @xmath candidate events compared to
the expectation of @xmath events.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, we have searched for physics beyond the Standard Model in
a channel in which new phenomena due to supersymmetry or extra
dimensions, for example, could well appear. In particular, we have
repeated the Run I CDF search for inclusive lepton + photon production,
a final state in which both a very rare event appeared and also in which
there seemed to be an excess over SM predictions. The new analysis, the
subject of this thesis, was done specifically with the same kinematic
requirements as the Run I search, but with a significantly larger data
sample and a higher collision energy.

We conclude that the excess in the @xmath signature in Run I of 2.7
sigma was at least largely a statistical fluctuation. If the Run I ratio
of the number of @xmath events observed to the number expected, 16/7.6,
had held up, the “2.7 @xmath excess” in this channel observed in Run I
would have resulted in an observation of 78 @xmath 11 events when @xmath
are expected in the Run II repeat of the analysis, versus the @xmath
events observed.

We find that the numbers of events in the @xmath and @xmath subsamples
of the @xmath sample agree with the SM predictions. We find no events
like the @xmath candidate event of Run I, and, even more generally,
observe no @xmath events with anomalous large or with multiple photons.
We have no explanation for the Run I @xmath event, and nothing we have
measured leads us to believe that is background.

However, we still find that in the @xmath signature in the Run II data
the number of observed events is higher than predicted, although the
excess is now slight. It is possible that the leading-order + K-factor
theoretical calculations of the diboson @xmath and @xmath channels,
which contain many diagrams including initial state radiation, are not
precise enough for the precision we have now reached.

Alternatively, or perhaps in addition, this analysis has observed a
small number of events on the ‘tails’ of the kinematic distributions, in
regions we expect few SM events. These events contribute to the
observation of more events than expected in the @xmath signature, much
as the @xmath event contributed to the excess in the Run I search.
Whether these are very rare backgrounds or something new will require
yet more data.

The Fermilab plan is to have a factor of 10-20 more data than presented
here by the end of Run II of the Tevatron. The increased statistics will
require an improved understanding of backgrounds as well as better SM
predictions. In particular the estimate of the rate for a jet to be
misidentified as a photon is limited now by the statistics for high-
@xmath photons; we expect the estimate will significantly improve with
more data.

In summary, while it would have been very exciting to find physics
beyond the Standard Model, we found no more @xmath events in a much
larger sample than in Run I, and the Run I excess in @xmath became less
significant rather than more. However, we have conclusively settled a
question that generated much interest in the theoretical community. The
channels we have investigated will remain interesting, and the
techniques we have developed and the knowledge gained will be useful for
similar searches at the LHC.

@xmath in the 8 bins of luminosity (Table 4.1 ) in Figure A.11 .

### a.5 CMX vs CMUP muons: Comparison of Isolation Variables

We have checked that muons that go into the CMX system have the same
isolation properties as CMUP muons. Figure A.12 shows the distributions
in calorimeter isolation, relative track isolation (total @xmath of
tracks in a cone in @xmath space of radius @xmath around the muon track
divided by @xmath ) and absolute track isolation for and events.

### a.6 Fake Electrons from Photon Conversions

There are three dominant sources of fake electrons: a) photons from
@xmath , @xmath and other mesons, that convert into asymmetric @xmath
pairs in the material before the COT volume, b) charged hadrons in jets
that either interact in the electromagnetic volume of the calorimeter or
overlap with a @xmath or secondary photon in the jet, and c) electrons
from the decay of heavy flavor ( @xmath , @xmath , and maybe even @xmath
). We estimated these backgrounds in Section 10.2 by studying the total
@xmath of tracks in a cone in @xmath space of radius @xmath around the
lepton track.

We consider fake electrons from photon conversions below. Electrons
coming from photon conversion are identified by conversion algorithm,
which looks for couple of opposite sign tracks with @xmath 0.2 cm and
@xmath 0.04.

For each electron a conversion flag is tested. We define if the electron
is flagged as coming from a conversion ( @xmath ) or from trident events
where a conversion is caused by a bremsstrahlung photon ( @xmath ). We
study same-sign events in sample and then check how many of them contain
electrons tagged as conversions or tridents.

Figure A.13 shows the distributions for same-sign and opposite-sign
@xmath pairs. The invariant mass of the same-sign electrons is shifted
with respect to the invariant mass of (Figure A.13 , a). We observe
similar behavior (shift in invariant mass distribution) in the MC as in
data (Figure A.14 ).

To develop an understanding of the conversion cut for the candidate
events, we summarize the same-sign events in sample. Out of @xmath
events in this sample only @xmath are not tagged as either a conversion
electron or a trident. We find that we have @xmath same sign muon
events, which is comparable to @xmath non-conversion/trident same-sign
electron events.

### a.7 Checking the @xmath and @xmath for Additional Backgrounds

We have used a number of techniques, described below, to look for
additional backgrounds in the @xmath and @xmath samples.

##### Same-Sign Leptons to Estimate Jets Faking one or More Leptons

We used results from Ref. [ 84 ] on the numbers of same-sign (SS) and
other-sign (OS) muon pairs in the dimuon sample. The expected background
from SS muon pairs to @xmath is calculated as follows.

First we obtain the ratio of W+1 jet events to OS events, x, expected in
the dimuon sample: x = SS/OS @xmath 1.51 @xmath 0.05. For the @xmath
sample ratio of SS/OS is of order of 0.05% and therefore x=0.1%. In the
@xmath sample we have 12 OS events, and therefore the expected
background from W+1 jet is negligible, 0.1% @xmath 12 = 0.012 @xmath
0.001 events.

##### Decays in flight of Low Momentum @xmath Faking a High-Momentum
Muon

A low-momentum hadron, not in an energetic jet, can decay to a muon
forming a “kink” between the hadron and muon trajectories (Figure A.16
). In this case a high-momentum track may be reconstructed from the
initial track segment due to the hadron and the secondary track segment
from the muon. A kaon that decays before the COT volume results in a
muon whose momentum is correctly measured; a kaon that decays after the
COT is itself correctly measured. These contributions are included in
the total background estimate (see Section 10.2 ).

The contribution from this background is estimated by identifying tracks
consistent with a “kink” in the COT. We count the number of times that,
proceeding radially along a COT track, a “hit” in the n+1 layer of
sense-wires is on the other side of the fitted track from the hit in the
nth layer. Real tracks will have hits distributed on both sides of the
fit, and will therefore have many “transitions”. A mis-measured track
from a 5- @xmath @xmath (for example), on the other hand, will consist
of two intersecting low-momentum arcs fit by a high momentum track, and
will have a small number of transitions [ 85 ] .

Figure A.16 shows the number of transitions in muons in the control
sample, and in a sample enriched in hadron decays by selecting events
with a large @xmath , at least one jet and muon that have large impact
parameter @xmath cm. Figure A.17 shows the number of transitions for
muon tracks with and without silicon hits. The red curve is the
distribution for the muons from sample. Decays-in-flight have a
distribution that peaks much lower, with few events above 30
transitions. We see no evidence that any of these tracks are DIF muons.

##### @xmath, @xmath Cosmics Background

For this we invert cosmic cut, and require the event to be tagged as
cosmic [ 59 ] . We processed the unstripped high- @xmath muon sample
with this inverted requirement and found no @xmath or @xmath candidate
events.

In addition we scanned our @xmath and @xmath candidate events with CDF
Run II Event Display (Section 3 ) and made sure that none of them look
like beam halo or cosmics events.
