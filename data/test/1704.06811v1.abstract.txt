Einstein’s field equation of General Relativity (GR) has been known for over 100
years, yet it remains challenging to solve analytically in strongly relativistic regimes,
particularly where there is a lack of a priori symmetry. Numerical Relativity (NR) -
the evolution of the Einstein Equations using a computer - is now a relatively mature
tool which enables such cases to be explored. In this thesis, a description is given of
the development and application of a new Numerical Relativity code, GRChombo.
GRChombo uses the standard BSSN formalism, incorporating full adaptive mesh
refinement (AMR) and massive parallelism via the Message Passing Interface (MPI).
The AMR capability permits the study of physics which has previously been compu-
tationally infeasible in a full 3 + 1 setting. The functionality of the code is described,
its performance characteristics are demonstrated, and it is shown that it can stably
and accurately evolve standard spacetimes such as black hole mergers.
We use GRChombo to study the effects of inhomogeneous initial conditions on
the robustness of small and large field inflationary models. We find that small field
inflation can fail in the presence of subdominant scalar gradient energies, suggesting
that it is much less robust than large field inflation. We show that increasing
initial gradients will not form sufficiently massive inflation-ending black holes if the
initial hypersurface is approximately flat. Finally, we consider the large field case
with a varying extrinsic curvature K, and find that part of the spacetime remains
inflationary if the spacetime is open, which confirms previous theoretical studies.
We investigate the critical behaviour which occurs in the collapse of both spheri-
cally symmetric and asymmetric scalar field bubbles. We use a minimally coupled
scalar field subject to a “double well” interaction potential, with the bubble wall
spanning the barrier between two degenerate minima. We find that the symmetric
and asymmetric cases exhibit Type 2 critical behaviour with the critical index con-
sistent with a value of γ = 0.37 for the dominant unstable mode. We do not see
strong evidence of echoing in the solutions, which is probably due to being too far
from the critical point to properly observe the critical solution.
We suggest areas for improvement and further study, and other applications.
