In this thesis we study the classical and quantum momentum maps and the
theory of reduction. We focus on the notion of momentum map in Poisson
geometry and we discuss the classification of the momentum map in this
framework. Furthermore, we describe the so-called Poisson Reduction, a
technique that allows us to reduce the dimension of a manifold in
presence of symmetries implemented by Poisson actions.

Using techniques of deformation quantization and quantum groups, we
introduce the quantum momentum map as a deformation of the classical
momentum map, constructed in such a way that it factorizes the quantum
action. As an application we discuss some examples of quantum reduction.
