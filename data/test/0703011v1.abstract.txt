We present results of a search for for the anomalous production of
events containing a high-transverse momentum charged lepton ( @xmath ,
either @xmath or @xmath ) and photon ( @xmath ), accompanied by missing
transverse energy ( ), and/or additional leptons and photons, and jets
(X). We use the same kinematic selection criteria as in a previous CDF
search, but with a substantially larger data set, @xmath @xmath , a
@xmath collision energy of 1.96 @xmath , and the upgraded CDF II
detector. We find @xmath @xmath events versus a standard model
expectation of @xmath events. The level of excess observed in Run I, 16
events with an expectation of 7.6 @xmath 0.7 events (corresponding to a
2.7 @xmath effect), is not supported by the new data. In the signature
of @xmath we observe @xmath events versus an expectation of @xmath
events. In this sample we find no events with an extra photon or and so
find no events like the one @xmath event observed in Run I.
