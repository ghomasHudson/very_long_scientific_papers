A well known result of Drinfeld classifies Poisson Lie groups @xmath in
terms of Lie algebraic data in the form of Manin triples @xmath ; he
also classified compatible Poisson structures on @xmath -homogeneous
spaces @xmath in terms of Lagrangian subalgebras @xmath with @xmath Lie
@xmath . Using the language of Courant algebroids and groupoids,
Li-Bland and Meinrenken formalized the notion of Dirac Lie groups and
classified them in terms of so-called “ @xmath -equivariant Dirac Manin
triples” @xmath ; this generalizes the first result of Drinfeld, as each
Poisson Lie group gives a unique Dirac Lie group structure.
In this thesis, we consider a notion of homogeneous space for Dirac Lie
groups, and classify them in terms of @xmath -invariant coisotropic
subalgebras @xmath , with @xmath . The relation between Poisson and
Dirac morphisms makes Drinfeld’s second result a special case of this
classification.
