## Chapter \thechapter Introduction

Supernovae (hereafter SNe) correspond to the explosive, high-energy
final stages of some stars. The mechanical energy released in these
powerful events can reach as much as 10 @xmath erg (or 1 foe), and their
peak luminosities can be comparable to the total light of their
host-galaxies. SNe can be classified in two types, either “Core
Collapse” or “Thermonuclear”, depending on their explosion mechanisms.

Core-collapse SNe (CCSNe) are closely associated to star forming regions
in late-type galaxies (Anderson & James 2008 ) . Therefore they have
been attributed to massive stars born with @xmath 8 \msun that undergo
the collapse of their iron cores after a few million years of evolution
and the subsequent ejection of their envelopes (Burrows 2000 ) . These
SNe leave a compact object as a remnant, either a neutron star or a
black hole (Baade & Zwicky 1934 ; Arnett 1996 ) . The core-collapse
model received considerable support with the first detection of
neutrinos from the Type II SN 1987A (Svoboda et al. 1987 ) , although no
compact remnant has been found so far in the explosion site. Among CCSNe
we can observationally distinguish those with prominent hydrogen lines
in their spectra (dubbed Type II), those with no H but strong He lines
(Type Ib), and those lacking H or He lines (Type Ic) (Minkowski 1941 ;
Filippenko 1997 ) . Although all of these objects are thought to share
the same explosion mechanism, their different observational properties
are explained in terms of how much of their H-rich and He-rich envelopes
were retained prior to explosion. When the star explodes with a
significant fraction of its initial H-rich envelope, in theory it should
display a H-rich spectrum and a light curve characterized by a phase of
@xmath 100 days of nearly constant luminosity followed by a sudden drop
of 2–3 mag (Nadyozhin 2003 ; Utrobin 2007 ; Bersten et al. 2008 ) .
Nearly 50% of all CCSNe belong to this class of Type II “Plateau” SNe (
\sneiip ).

Thermonuclear SNe are characterized by the lack of hydrogen and helium
in their spectra. Their early-time spectra show strong lines due to
intermediate mass elements (e.g. \ion Si2, \ion Ca2, \ion Mg2;
Filippenko 1997 ) . They are found both in elliptical, spiral, or
irregular galaxies. These objects are thought to originate in low-mass
stars that end their lifes as white dwarfs and explode after a period of
mass accretion from a companion star, leaving no compact remnants behind
them (Hillebrandt & Niemeyer 2000 ) . Observationally they are referred
as Type Ia SNe.

Given their large intrinsic luminosities, SNe have long been considered
potential probes for extra-galactic distance determinations and the
measurement of the cosmological parameters that drive the Universe
dynamics. Among all types of SNe, the Type Ia family is the one
displaying the highest degree of homogeneity (Li et al. 2001 ) , both
photometrically and spectroscopically. However, these objects are not
perfect standard candles. Empirical calibrations have allowed us to
standardize their luminosities to levels of @xmath 0.15–0.22 mag and
determine distances to their host-galaxies with an unrivaled precision
of @xmath 7%–10% (Phillips 1993 ; Hamuy et al. 1996 ; Phillips et al.
1999 ) . This powerful technique led a decade ago to the construction of
Hubble diagrams between @xmath –0.5 and measure very precisely the
history of the expansion of the Universe over 5 Gyr of look-back time.
Contrary to our intuition these observations revealed that the Universe
dynamics is described by an accelerated expansion (Riess et al. 1998 ;
Perlmutter et al. 1999 ; Astier et al. 2006 ; Wood-Vasey et al. 2007 ) .
The discovery of the accelerating Universe is profoundly connected with
theoretical cosmology as it implies the possible existence of a
cosmological constant, a concept initially introduced by Albert Einstein
at the beginning of the 20th century, whose origin still is a mystery.

Although the acceleration of the Universe has been indirectly confirmed
by other independent experiments such as the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP; Spergel et al. 2007 ; Bennett et al. 2003 ) and
the Baryon Accoustic Oscillations (BAO; Blake & Glazebrook 2003 ; Seo &
Eisenstein 2003 ) , it is important to obtain independent confirmation
of the Type Ia results. Although not as bright and uniform as the
Type Ia’s, Hamuy & Pinto ( 2002 ) showed that the luminosities of
\sneiip can be standardized to levels of 0.4 and 0.3 mag in the @xmath -
and @xmath -bands respectively, thus converting these objects into
potentially useful tools to measure cosmological parameters.

Even though \sneiip are 1–2 mag fainter and much less homogeneous than
SNe Ia, these objects provide two interesting routes to distance
determinations. First, the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM, Kirshner &
Kwan 1974 ) , a theoretical technique based on atmosphere models that is
independent of the extra-galactic distance scale (Eastman et al. 1996 ;
Dessart & Hillier 2005 ) . This method can achieve dispersions of
0.3 mag in the Hubble diagram, which translates into a 14% precision in
distance (Schmidt et al. 1994 ; Hamuy 2001 ; Jones et al. 2008 ) .
Second, the Standardized Candle Method (SCM for short), an empirical
technique initially proposed by Hamuy & Pinto ( 2002 ) that is based on
an observational correlation between the absolute magnitude of the SN
and the expansion velocity of the photosphere, the Luminosity-Expansion
Velocity ( \lumvel ) relation. This correlation shows that \sneiip with
greater luminosities have higher expansion velocities, which permits one
to remove the large ( @xmath 4 mag) luminosity differences displayed by
these objects to levels of only 0.3 mag. So far, the SCM has been
applied to 24 low- @xmath ( @xmath ) SNe (Hamuy 2003 ) and more recently
by Nugent et al. ( 2006 ) to 5 high- @xmath ( @xmath ) SNe. The latter
work was the first attempt to derive cosmological parameters from
\sneiip and demonstrated the enormous potential of this class of objects
as cosmological probes.

The upcoming years will witness the deployment of several survey
telescopes, such as the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response
System (Pan-STARRS; Hodapp et al. 2004 ) , the Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope (LSST; Tyson et al. 2003 ) , the Visible and Infrared Survey
Telescope (VISTA; Emerson et al. 2004 ) , the VLT Survey Telescope (VST;
Capaccioli et al. 2003 ) , the Dark Energy Survey (DES; Castander 2007 )
, and the Skymapper (Granlund et al. 2006 ) , all of which offer the
promise to discover SNe by the thousands. Whether we use it or not, we
will be inevitably confronted by enormous amounts of data on \sneiip
which will contain valuable cosmological information. In spite of the
great promise shown by the SCM, it still suffers from a variety of
problems which need to be addressed: 1) the lack of a well-defined
maximum in the light curves has prevented us from defining the phase of
each event; 2) each SN shows a different color evolution, which has
compromised the use of the photometric data for the determination of
host-galaxy extinction; 3) the assumption for dereddening employed by
Hamuy & Pinto ( 2002 ) , namely that all SNe reach the same asymptotic
color toward the end of the plateau phase, has often led to negative
extinctions so it still needs to be further tested; 4) the small sample
size used so far, especially the scarcity of SNe in the Hubble flow, has
prevented a proper determination of the intrinsic precision of the
method.

The purpose of this research is to take advantage of the larger and more
distant sample of \sneiip available to us today to address the issues
mentioned above, refine the SCM, and assess the feasibility of using
\sneiip to measure distances in the Universe, in preparation for the
massive samples of high- @xmath SNe which will be produced in the years
to come. With this purpose in mind we have developed a robust
mathematical procedure to model the light curves, color curves, and
velocity curves, in order to obtain a more accurate determination of the
relevant parameters required by the SCM (magnitudes, colors and ejecta
velocities). This work makes use of 37 SNe to construct a Hubble diagram
(HD), evaluate the accuracy of the SCM, and obtain an independent
determination of the Hubble constant. Since our sample has several
objects in common with the recent EPM analysis of Jones et al. ( 2008 )
, we perform a comparison between SCM and EPM.

We organize this thesis as follows. In § EL MÉTODO DE PATRONES
ESTANDARIZABLES PARA SUPERNOVAS TIPO II-PLATEAU we describe all of the
observational material used in this work such as the telescopes,
intruments and surveys involved. The analysis, methodology and
procedures, such as the @xmath and @xmath corrections, are explained in
detail in § EL MÉTODO DE PATRONES ESTANDARIZABLES PARA SUPERNOVAS TIPO
II-PLATEAU . The dereddening analysis, the Hubble diagram, the value of
the Hubble constant, and the distance comparison between SCM and EPM are
addressed in § EL MÉTODO DE PATRONES ESTANDARIZABLES PARA SUPERNOVAS
TIPO II-PLATEAU . The final remarks in § EL MÉTODO DE PATRONES
ESTANDARIZABLES PARA SUPERNOVAS TIPO II-PLATEAU provide a discussion
about possible variations of the reddening law for \sneiip along with
comparisons between the value of @xmath computed by us and those derived
from other methods. The first part of this section explores the
possibility of a non-standard extinction law in the SN host-galaxies. We
present our conclusions in § EL MÉTODO DE PATRONES ESTANDARIZABLES PARA
SUPERNOVAS TIPO II-PLATEAU .

## Chapter \thechapter Observational Material

This work makes use of data obtained in the course of four systematic SN
follow-up programs carried out between 1986–2003: 1) the Cerro Tololo SN
program (1986–1996); 2) the Calán/Tololo SN program (CT, 1990–1993);
3) the Optical and Infrared Supernova Survey (SOIRS, 1999–2000); 4) the
Carnegie Type II Supernova Program (CATS, 2002–2003). As a result of
these efforts photometry and spectroscopy (some IR but mostly optical)
was obtained for nearly 100 SNe of all types, 51 of which belong to the
Type II class. All of the optical data have been already reduced and
they are being prepared for publication (Hamuy et al. 2008 ) . Next we
describe in general terms the data acquisition and reduction procedures.
For more details the reader can refer to Hamuy et al. ( 2008 ) .

### 1 Photometric Data

The photometry was acquired with telescopes from Cerro Tololo
Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), Las Campanas Observatory (LCO), the
European Southern Observatory (ESO) in La Silla, and Steward Observatory
(SO). A host of different telescopes and intruments were used to
generate this dataset as shown in Table 1 . In all cases we employed CCD
detectors and standard Johnson-Kron-Cousins-Hamuy @xmath filters
(Johnson et al. 1966 ; Cousins 1971 ; Hamuy et al. 2001 ) .

The images were processed with IRAF ¹ ¹ 1 IRAF is distributed by the
National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which are operated by the
Association of Universities for Research in Astyronomy, Inc., under
cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation. through bias
subtraction and flatfielding. All of them were further processed through
the step of galaxy subtraction using template images of the
host-galaxies. Photometric sequences were established around each SN
based on observations of Landolt and Hamuy standards (Landolt 1992 ;
Hamuy et al. 1992, 1994 ) . The photometry of all SNe was performed
differentially with respect to the local sequence on the
galaxy-subtracted images. The transformation of instrumental magnitudes
to the standard system was done by taking into account a linear
color-term and a zero-point. Although this procedure partially removes
the instrument-to-instrument differences in the SN magnitudes, it should
be kept in mind that significant systematic discrepancies can still
remain owing to the non-stellar nature of the SN spectrum (e.g.  Hamuy
et al. 1990 ) .

### 2 Spectroscopic Data

The spectroscopic data were also obtained with a great variety of
instruments and telescopes as shown in Table 1 . The observations
consisted of the SN observation immediately followed by an arc lamp
taken at the same position in the sky, and 2–3 flux standards per night
from the list of Hamuy et al. ( 1992, 1994 ) .

We always used CCD detectors, in combination with different
gratings/grisms and blocking filters. The reductions were performed with
IRAF and consisted in bias subtraction, flatfielding, 1D spectrum
extraction and sky subtraction, wavelength and flux calibration. No
attempts were done to remove the telluric lines.

### 3 Subsample used for this work

Of the 51 SNe II observed in the course of these four surveys, a subset
of 33 objects comply with the requirements of 1) having light curves
with good temporal coverage; 2) having sufficient spectroscopic temporal
coverage; 3) being a member of the plateau class. To this sample we
added four SNe from the literature: SN 1999gi, SN 2004dj, SN 2004et, and
SN 2005cs. Complementary photometry for SN 2003gd obtained by Van Dyk et
al. ( 2003 ) and Hendry et al. ( 2005 ) was also incorporated in our
analysis. Table 2 lists our final sample of 37 \sneiip . For each SN
this table includes the name of the host-galaxy, equatorial coordinates,
the heliocentric redshift and its source, the reddening due to our own
Galaxy (Schlegel et al. 1998 ) and the survey or reference for the data.

## Chapter \thechapter Methodology and Procedures

### 4 AKA corrections

The photon flux measured by an observer is related to the intrinsic
luminosity of the source, its distance, dust extinction along the line
of sight, and the shift of the spectral energy distribution (SED) to
longer wavelengths caused by the expansion of the Universe. More
specifically, if @xmath is the SN rest-frame emergent luminosity in
units of @xmath Å @xmath , the photon flux per unit wavelength seen by
the observer (in units of @xmath Å @xmath ), is

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (1)
  -- -------- -- -----

where @xmath is the SN rest-frame wavelength, @xmath = @xmath is the
observer’s wavelength, and @xmath is the luminosity distance to the
source.

The flux is modified along its journey to the observer in the following
order: host-galaxy reddening ( @xmath ), redshift ( @xmath -term), and
Galactic reddening ( @xmath ) (or AKA, for short). In order to be able
to extract the distance from the observed fluxes, it proves necessary to
remove Nature’s imprint on the observed magnitudes in reverse order. To
undo Nature’s work, we first need to correct the observed magnitudes for
Galactic extinction ( @xmath ), which is equivalent to moving the
observer outside the Milky Way. Then we must move the observer just
outside the host-galaxy, for which we must correct the spectrum for the
redshift caused by the expansion of the Universe ( @xmath correction).
Finally, we must correct the magnitudes for host-galaxy extinction (
@xmath ), which brings the observer to the SN rest-frame. For the latter
step we used as a first approximation the reddenings determined by
Dessart ( 2008 ) . In a second iteration we applied our own reddenings
(see § 6 ).

In this work the AKA corrections are computed numerically using a
library of 196 \sneiip optical spectra. Most of the spectra comes from
our own database of 44 Type II SNe, 10 of which are not included in
Table 2 (SN 1987A, SN 1988A, SN 1989L, SN 1990E, SN 1990K, SN 1993S,
SN 1999eg, SN 2000cb, SN 2002gd, and SN 2003ib). These 10 additional
objects belong to the Type II class, although do not comply with the
requirements of § 3 to be included in this analysis. The database
comprises spectra covering the plateau and nebular phases. Each spectrum
is brought to the SN rest-frame, i.e., to redshift zero and null
Galactic reddening using the redshifts and Galactic reddenings listed in
Table 2 . Also the spectra are corrected using our own host-galaxy
reddenings, as determined below (see § 6 ).

#### 4.1 @xmath corrections

We define the synthetic apparent Galactic extinction correction as the
difference between the magnitude of an unextinguished SED and the
magnitude of the extinguished SED, i.e.,

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (2)
  -- -------- -- -----

where @xmath is the filter transmission function (see Appendix EL MÉTODO
DE PATRONES ESTANDARIZABLES PARA SUPERNOVAS TIPO II-PLATEAU ). We apply
this definition to all the spectra of our library using the @xmath
bandpasses. Since the effective wavelength @xmath changes as the SN
spectrum evolves, we expect the apparent @xmath to be a function of the
color of the SED. To examine this point, Figure 1 shows @xmath against
\bv for the specific case of @xmath ² ² 2 @xmath is the visual absolute
extinction at 5500 Å as defined by Cardelli et al. ( 1989 ) . = 1 mag,
where we identify with different colors spectra from the plateau and
nebular phases.

Although the apparent @xmath does not show large variations, the
dependence on color is evident and must be taken into account. For this
purpose we chose to fit these relations with 3rd order polynomials. With
this calibration we can proceed to interpolate the corresponding value
of the apparent @xmath for the specific color of the SN and subtract
this value from the observed magnitudes at every epoch we have
photometry to obtain ( @xmath ). The RMS of our calibration —0.0008 mag—
provides an estimate of the uncertainty in the correction, so we add
this number in quadrature to the uncertainty in the observed magnitudes.

#### 4.2 @xmath corrections

We use a similar procedure to compute the @xmath corrections. The
synthetic @xmath -term is defined as the difference between the
magnitude of a redshifted SED and the magnitude of the zero-redshift
SED, i.e.,

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (3)
  -- -------- -- -----

This definition is equivalent to that given by Schneider et al. ( 1983 )
except that they use fluxes per unit frequency. By definition the @xmath
-term is a color, therefore we expect it to correlate with the
broad-band colors of the SED. To demonstrate this point, Figure 2 shows
@xmath versus \bv for the specific case of the @xmath -band for @xmath
=0.05.

This dependence is very useful as it permits us to interpolate @xmath
values for the specific color of the SN and correct the photometry at
the plateau or nebular phases separately. The result of this correction
is the quantity ( @xmath ). The RMS of the points around the polynomial
fits are of the order of @xmath 0.001–0.01 mag, and these are
quadratically added to the error of ( @xmath ) in order to account for
the uncertainties in the @xmath correction.

#### 4.3 @xmath corrections

Finally, we must repeat the previous process for the @xmath correction.
The following equation

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (4)
  -- -------- -- -----

defines the apparent @xmath and gives the difference between the
magnitude of the supernova right outside the host-galaxy ( @xmath ) and
the magnitude free of host-galaxy dust ( @xmath ).

Figure 3 shows this correction for all the plateau and nebular spectra
of our library separately for the specific case @xmath ³ ³ 3 @xmath is
the visual absolute extinction at 5500 Å as defined by Cardelli et al. (
1989 ) . = 1 mag, which confirms the previous results, namely that the
apparent @xmath is a function of the broad-band colors. We fit these
relations with a 3 @xmath order polynomial and apply these calibrations
to the SN magnitudes, making sure to include the RMS of the fits
—varying between 0.003–0.01— in the error budget. At this point, we
obtain the magnitude of the SN corrected for Galactic extinction,
redshift and host-galaxy extinction for all epochs (colors) of the SN.

### 5 Fits to light, color and velocity curves

In the first incarnation of the SCM Hamuy & Pinto ( 2002 ) measured all
the relevant quantities (magnitudes, colors and velocities) at fixed
epochs with respect to the time of explosion. In most cases, however, it
proves hard to constrain this time, thus hampering the task to compare
data obtained for different SNe. It would be ideal to have a conspicuous
feature in the light curves but, unlike other SN types, \sneiip
generally do not show an obvious maximum during the plateau phase.

One way around this is to use the end of the plateau as an estimate of
the time origin for each event. Although simple in theory, in practice
it is not easy to measure this time owing to the coarser sampling of the
light curves at this phase. Thus, our first aim is to implement a robust
light curve fitting procedure in order to obtain a reliable time origin
to be used as a uniform reference epoch to measure magnitudes, colors,
and expansion velocities. In the remainder of this section we proceed to
implement fitting methods to measure reliable colors and expansion
velocities.

#### 5.1 @xmath light curve fits

Figures 4 and 5 show @xmath light curves of eight well-observed \sneiip
. These SNe are representative of the whole sample. As can be seen,
there are three distinguishable phases in the light curves:

  —  

    The Plateau phase in which the SN shows an almost constant
    luminosity during the first @xmath 100 days of its evolution. This
    phase corresponds to the optically thick period in which a hydrogen
    recombination wave recedes in mass, gradually releasing the internal
    energy of the star (Nadyozhin 2003 ; Utrobin 2007 ; Bersten et al.
    2008 ) .

  —  

    The Linear or Radioactive Tail , a linear decay in magnitude
    (exponential in flux) starting about 100 days after the explosion.
    This phase corresponds to the optically thin period powered by the
    @xmath Co @xmath @xmath Fe radioactive decay (Weaver & Woosley 1980
    ) .

  —  

    A Transition phase of @xmath 30 days between the plateau and linear
    phases.

Both the plateau and linear phases are trivial to model if taken
separetely, but the abrupt transition makes the fitting task much more
challenging, especially with coarsely sampled light curves. The first
attempt consisted in using the Local Polynomial Regression Fitting , a
technique developed by Cleveland et al. ( 1992 ) within the framework of
the R environment for statistical computing. The name of the method is
self-explanatory, since it performs a polynomial regression over small
local intervals along the domain using a routine called loess . Figure 7
shows the resulting fits when all the data are fitted simultaneously by
loess . The small scale features of the plateau are nicely reproduced,
but loess is unable to model the transition satisfactorily. Another
attempt was done by fitting separately the three phases of the light
curves. The results, shown in Figure 7 , satisfy our needs, but the lack
of continuity at the two interfaces led us to look for alternative
approaches.

After experimenting with several fitting approaches we concluded that
the best fits could be achieved with analytic functions. After examining
several options we ended up using the arithmetic sum of the three
functions shown in Figure 8 :

 @xmath 

    A Fermi-Dirac function (red dashed line in Fig. 8 ) which provides a
    very good description of the transition between the plateau and
    radioactive phases.

      -- -------- -- -----
         @xmath      (5)
      -- -------- -- -----

        @xmath : represents the height of the step in units of
        magnitude.

        @xmath : corresponds to the middle of the transition phase and
        is a natural candidate to define the origin of the time axis.

        @xmath : quantifies the width of the transition phase. At @xmath
        the height of the step has been reduced by 4.7%, and it
        decreases down to 95.3% at @xmath .

 @xmath 

    A straight line (green dashed line in Fig. 8 ) which accounts for
    the slope due to the radiactive decay.

      -- -------- -- -----
         @xmath      (6)
      -- -------- -- -----

        @xmath : corresponds to the slope of radioactive tail and an
        approximate slope for the plateau in units of magnitudes per
        day.

        @xmath : corresponds to the zero point in magnitude at @xmath .

 @xmath 

    A Gaussian function (blue dashed line in Fig. 8 ) which serves
    mainly for fitting the @xmath light bump curve and the @xmath light
    curve curvature during the plateau phase.

      -- -------- -- -----
         @xmath      (7)
      -- -------- -- -----

    The Gaussian function is also useful for reproducing the small scale
    features that can appear in the @xmath -band plateau.

        @xmath : height of the Gaussian peak in units of magnitudes.

        @xmath : center of the Gaussian function in days.

        @xmath : width of the Gaussian function.

The resulting analytic function we use to model the light curves, is the
sum of the three functions detailed above

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -----

which has 8 free parameters. It is fitted to the individual light curves
using a @xmath minimizing procedure. In order to find the minimum @xmath
we use the Downhill Simplex Method (see Appendix EL MÉTODO DE PATRONES
ESTANDARIZABLES PARA SUPERNOVAS TIPO II-PLATEAU ), which although is not
very efficient in terms of the number of iterations required, provides
robust solutions. Examples of the analytic fits are shown as dotted
lines in Figures 4 and 5 . Although we cannot model most of the small
scale features in the plateau, the fitting does a really good job
modelling the transition. Furthermore, the analytic function gives us
important parameters that characterize the light curve shape,
particularly @xmath which provides a time origin. In the plots in Fig. 4
the time axis is chosen to coincide with the value of this parameter
obtained from the @xmath light curve. A critical quantity in the
analysis that follows is @xmath and its uncertainty, both of which
determine the uncertainties in all the relevant SCM quantities.
Normally, when the tail phase has been observed the @xmath minimizing
routine has no difficulties finding @xmath and delivers a credible
error. On the other hand, when the light curve does not have any
late-time data points the routine underestimates @xmath , in which case
we need to provide a more realistic estimate of this uncertainty. The
criteria to fix @xmath depend on what fraction of the transition phase
was sampled. Two useful parameters are introduced to describe such
sampling:

    @xmath : the day of the last data point for a given SN.

    @xmath : the approximate day of the end of the @xmath -band plateau.
    We estimate this time around each observed point, by calculating the
    magnitude difference, @xmath , between the previous and the
    following point. We start from the earliest epochs onward in time,
    until @xmath exceeds 0.7 mag. This value is an input parameter for
    the fitting routine (see Appendix EL MÉTODO DE PATRONES
    ESTANDARIZABLES PARA SUPERNOVAS TIPO II-PLATEAU ).

The criteria to estimate @xmath and @xmath are the following,

1.  When the transition can be clearly seen, but if we are uncertain
    that the last data point (at @xmath ) belongs to the tail phase, we
    set a conservative estimate of @xmath =5 days. An example of such a
    case is SN 2003hl (Fig. 4 ).

2.  When the transition can be clearly seen, but we are sure that the
    last data point (at @xmath ) does not belong to the tail phase (see
    SN 2003hg and SN 2003iq in Fig. 5 ), the routine usually fails to
    converge to a reasonable value because there are not enough
    constraints on the transition phase. We identify the failing cases
    when @xmath because @xmath is never greater than @xmath . In these
    cases, we set @xmath since the typical value for the width of the
    transition is 30 days. For this same reason the value of @xmath is
    set to 15 days, a very conservative value as it encompasses the full
    possible range of @xmath values.

3.  When the plateau was extensively observed for more than 100 days but
    could not detect any hints of the transition (see SN 1999br in Fig.
    5 ), we arbitrarily set @xmath , because the plateau phase usually
    lasts @xmath 100 days. In the two cases where we face this
    situation, @xmath is set to 20 days, which generously covers the
    possibility of a longer plateau.

Regardless of the sampling of the light curves, we assign a minimum of
@xmath .

The light curve fits also have a healthy benefit: they allow us to
interpolate magnitudes at epochs where only one of the magnitudes was
obtained and the second magnitude, necessary to construct a color, is
missing. Without a color we would be unable to calculate the AKA
corrections, so that the interpolation feature is extremely beneficial
as it permits one to correct magnitudes at all epochs.

#### 5.2 Color curves fits

Figure 9 shows the ( \bv ), ( \vr ), and ( \vi ) colors of three
proto-typical Type II-P SNe corrected for @xmath and @xmath -terms.

The time origin (the @xmath -axis) corresponds to @xmath , i.e. the
middle of the transition phase. In each case we employ all the data
points between day –100 and  –10 to fit a Legendre polynomial shown with
solid lines in Fig. 9 . The degree of the polynomial was chosen on a
case-by-case basis and varied between 3rd and 6th order. It is evident
that, during the plateau phase, the photosphere gets redder with time
owing to the decrease of the surface temperature as the SN expands. In
theory the photospheric temperature should approach and never get below
the temperature of hydrogen recombination around 5,000 K. Based on this
physical argument, Hamuy & Pinto ( 2002 ) argued that all \sneiip should
reach the same intrinsic colors toward the end of the plateau phase and,
therefore, they proposed that the color excesses measured at this phase
could be attributed to dust reddening in the SN host-galaxy and be
exploited to measure @xmath . Hamuy & Pinto ( 2002 ) performed their
analysis with a simple naked-eye estimate of the asymptotic colors. Here
we improve significantly this situation through the formal color curve
fitting procedure describe above.

Armed with the polynomial fits we proceeded to interpolate colors on a
continuous one-day spaced grid between day –80 and –10 for analyzing
colors at multiple epochs (see § 6 ). In a handful of cases the data did
not encompass the whole grid and we had to extrapolate colors, but never
by more than 3 days from the nearest data point.

#### 5.3 \ionFe2 based expansion velocity curves

The third ingredient for SCM is the velocity of the SN ejecta. It is
well known that different spectroscopic lines yield different expansion
velocities. The \ion Fe2 @xmath line is thought to closely match the SN
photospheric velocity and has been usually employed for SCM and EPM.
Here we use that line as a proxy for the velocity of the SN ejecta. Due
to the expansion of the envelope, the spectral lines show a P-Cygni
profile with an emission centered at the rest-frame wavelength @xmath
and an absorption shifted bluewards by @xmath . From a measurement of
@xmath we can compute an expansion velocity

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (9)
  -- -------- -- -----

In this study we use the expansion velocities measured by Jones et al. (
2008 ) . Figure 10 shows \ion Fe2 velocities as a function of SN phase,
for four different SNe selected for their wide range of sampling
characteristics.

In all cases the SNe show a systematic decrease of their velocities with
time. Two physical arguments support this observational fact: 1) all the
shells of the SN undergo an homologous expansion, i.e. the outer shells
move faster than the inner shells, and 2) the photosphere recedes in
mass allowing us to observe deeper and slower layers of the SN as time
passes. As shown by Fig. 10 the \ion Fe2 @xmath expansion velocity curve
during the plateau phase can be properly modeled with a power law of the
form

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (10)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are three free fitting parameters
without obvious physical meaning.

In general we fit for three free parameters ( @xmath ), but when only
two velocity measurements are available (e.g. SN 1992af in the upper
left panel of Fig. 10 ) we fix the @xmath exponent to –0.5, which
corresponds to a typical value for our sample. As shown with solid lines
in Figure 10 the fits are quite satisfactory. Here we choose to restrict
the power-law fits to the plateau phase, since the power-law behavior is
not observed for expansion velocities beyond the transition phase. We
use the same one-day continous grid as the color curves in order to
interpolate velocities at different epochs between –80 to –10 days.
Given the good quality of the fits and the shallow slope at late epochs,
we allow extrapolations of up to 15 days past the nearest data point
(see SN 1999cr in Fig. 10 ). At the left boundary we reduce the
extrapolations to 10 days prior to the first point, because the power
law gets steeper at early times (see SN 2003gd and SN 2004dj in Fig. 10
). When only two velocity measurements are available we reduce the
extrapolations by 5 days.

### 6 Host Extinction Determination

While the determination of Galactic reddening is straighforward —thanks
to the IR dust maps of Schlegel et al. ( 1998 ) —, it is much more
challenging to ascertain the extinction due to host-galaxy dust. To
address this issue here we assume that, owing to the hydrogen
recombination nature of their photospheres, all \sneiip should evolve
from a hot initial stage to one of similar photospheric temperature. If
two SNe have similar spectra but suffer different amounts of extinction,
all color indices of one object should be redder than the corresponding
color indices of the other object. This is the hypothesis we want to
test in this section.

Although simple in theory there are a couple of practical difficulties
to perform this test. First, it is not always possible to contrain the
time of explosion and line up color curves from different objects. One
way around this is to use the transition time @xmath defined in § 5.1 .
The second problem is illustrated in Figure 9 : the color curve shapes
can vary significantly from SN to SN, preventing one to measure a single
color offset between two SNe. Our approach to get around this is to pick
a single fiducial epoch in the color evolution and assess the
performance of such color as reddening estimator. Our polynomial fits to
the color curves are very convenient for this purpose as they allow us
to interpolate reliable colors on a day-to-day basis over a wide range
of epochs and explore which epoch is the one that gives the best
results.

If all SNe share the same intrinsic temperature at some epoch we expect
the subset of dereddened SNe to have nearly identical colors ( @xmath )
and the remaining objects should show color excesses, @xmath , in direct
proportion to their extinctions. A useful diagnostic to check our
underlying assumption is the color-color plot. Unreddened SNe should
occupy a small region in this plane. If we further assume the same
extinction law in the SN host-galaxies, the subset of extinguished
objects should describe a straight line originating from such region.
The figures of merit in this test are 1) the color dispersion displayed
by the unreddened SNe, 2) the slope described by the reddened SNe (which
is determined by the extinction law), and 3) the dispersion relative to
the straight line (the smaller the better).

We have identified four objects in our sample (SN 2003B, SN 2003bl,
SN 2003bn, SN 2003cn) consistent with zero reddening. Such objects were
selected for having: 1) no significant \nad interstellar lines in their
spectra at the redshifts of their host-galaxies, and 2) dust-free
early-time spectra. For the latter we used extinction values determined
by Dessart ( 2008 ) from fits of Type II-P SN atmosphere models to our
early-time spectra. Such models use the SN spectral lines to constrain
the photospheric temperature and the continuum to restrict the amount of
extinction. As shown in Figure 11 , the atmosphere models successfully
reproduce the early-time SN spectra.

We investigated two color-color plots ( \vi versus \vr , and \vi versus
\bv ) over a wide range (from day –50 to –15) of epochs after correcting
the photometry for Galactic extinction and @xmath -terms. The best
results obtained from our scrutiny is the ( \vi ) versus ( \vr ) diagram
constructed from day –30 and shown in Figure 12 . At this epoch
—approximately the end of the plateau— we obtain the linear behavior
expected for a sample with the same intrinsic color but different
degrees of extinction. Shown with a blue dot is the one SN consistent
with zero extinction which is, remarkably, one of the bluest objects in
this diagram; the other three unextinguished SNe do not have @xmath
-photometry. A least-squares fit to the data yields a slope of @xmath ,
which is close but not exactly equal to the @xmath ratio expected for a
Galactic extinction law ( @xmath ), shown as a vector in Figure 12 .
This suggests a somewhat different extinction law in the SN hosts
compared to the Galaxy. The dispersion of 0.059 in \vi is a promising
result as it translates into an uncertainty of @xmath mag, which
corresponds to the limiting precision of this method. The reduced @xmath
of 1.55 implies that the dispersion can be accounted almost solely by
our error bars and that any instrinsic color dispersion in our sample is
@xmath . The bottom line is that both the ( \vr ) and ( \vi ) colors
fulfill the minimum requirements as reddening indicators.

The best results from the ( \bv ) versus ( \vi ) analysis were obtained
from day –30, which are shown in Figure 13 . The four SNe consistent
with zero extinction, shown with red dots, average colors @xmath and
@xmath . Note that there are five SNe in this diagram which are slightly
bluer than the unreddened sample. The \vi color dispersion of 0.076 is
greater than that obtained in Fg. 12 and is most likely due to the \bv
color, since the @xmath -band is more sensitive to the metallicity of
the SN, owing to several absorption lines that lie in this spectral
region. Therefore we believe that the greater dispersion in this diagram
could be due to the different metallicities of our SN sample. A
least-squares fit to the data yields a slope of @xmath . This slope is
quite different than the @xmath ratio expected for the Galactic
extinction law (shown as a vector in Figure 13 ), in agreement with the
suggestion made in the previous paragraph from the ( \vi ) versus ( \vr
) diagram.

We conclude from our exploration that, while the \bv color is
problematic, both the ( \vr ) and ( \vi ) colors offer a promising route
for dereddening purposes. In what follows we will employ solely the \vi
color since only a small subset of our objects possess @xmath
photometry. Although the evidence points to a non-Galactic reddening
law, for now we will assume a standard reddening law (later on we will
relax this assumption; see section 9.2 ). Using our library of SNe II
spectra we computed synthetically the appropriate conversion factor
between @xmath and @xmath for Type II SNe and a standard reddening law (
@xmath ), which yielded:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (11)
  -- -------- -- ------

Assuming an intrinsic ( \vi ) @xmath the host-galaxy extinction can be
computed, with its corresponding uncertainty, from:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (12)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

where \vi corresponds to the color of a given SN at day –30 (corrected
for @xmath -terms and foreground extinction) and @xmath combines the
instrumental errors in the @xmath and @xmath magnitudes, the RMS of the
@xmath and @xmath terms (see § 4.1 and § 4.2 respectively), and the
uncertainty in @xmath (§ 5.1 ). The uncertainty in the intrinsic ( \vi )
@xmath color was also included in the error of @xmath along with the (
\vi ) RMS in the ( \vi ) versus ( \vr ) diagram. The host-galaxy
reddening values obtained from this technique are listed in column 5 of
Table 3 (with the uncertainties given in parenthesis for the whole
sample of 37 SNe). There are eight SNe with ( \vi ) colors bluer than (
\vi ) @xmath which stand out in this table for their negative
reddenings. Although not physically meaningful, these negative values
are statistically consistent with zero or moderate reddenings. In fact,
seven out of these eight objects differ by @xmath from zero reddening.
Only SN 1992af differs by @xmath from @xmath . In the following section
we compare this method to other dereddening techniques.

## Chapter \thechapter Analysis

### 7 Comparing dereddening techniques

At our request, Dessart ( 2008 ) has kindly performed fits of \sneiip
atmosphere models to our library of spectra. In these fits the spectral
lines are used to constrain the photospheric temperature and the
corresponding continuum is employed to estimate the extinction. A
crucial condition for this technique to work is the spectrophotometric
quality of the spectra.

In general our observations were obtained with the slit oriented along
the paralactic angle and the relative shape of the spectra should be
accurate. However, this was not always possible and sometimes the
spectra were contaminated from light of the host-galaxy or the slit
could not be rotated. For all these reasons we first checked the flux
calibration of each spectrum by synthesizing magnitudes and comparing
them to the observed magnitudes, duly interpolated to the time of the
spectroscopy. In general we found good agreement between the observed
and synthetic colors (Figure 14 ), thus confirming our confidence in the
flux calibration.

In the 64 cases (18% of all cases) where we found significant
differences between synthetic and observed colors ( @xmath 0.1 for any
color) we applied a low-order polynomial correction to the spectrum.
Basically, this “mangling” correction used the observed photometry to
change the slope of a spectrum. After checking the flux calibration (and
mangling it, if needed) the next step was to correct for Galactic
absorption and de-redshift the spectra. This database was then used by
Dessart ( 2008 ) for the atmosphere model fits. Examples of the fits are
shown in Fig. 11 .

The resulting spectroscopic reddenings are summarized in column 2 of
Table 3 . As pointed out by Dessart ( 2008 ) , the spectrum fitting
technique works much better with early-time spectra than with late-time
observations. At late times the photosphere has receded in mass exposing
inner and more metal-rich layers, which translates into an
over-abundance of heavy-elements absorption lines. Therefore the fitting
to the continuum —practically a temperature fitting— is hampered by the
presence of strong absorption lines at late times. According to this we
divided our sample in four quality subcategories based on the epoch and
the flux quality of the spectra used in the reddening determination:

  @xmath  

     gold : early-time spectra, without mangling correction

  @xmath  

     silver : early-time spectra, with mangling correction

  @xmath  

     bronze : late-time spectra, without mangling correction

  @xmath  

     coal : late-time spectra, with mangling correction

Note that the main criterion is whether the spectrum is early or late
and the second criterion corresponds to the flux calibration quality. We
trust more the spectra that do not require any corrections as they
reflect that the observations were better performed, so we consider the
unmangled spectra as higher-quality than the mangled ones. This
sub-classification is given for each SN in column 3 of Table 3 . As the
reader can notice, the error is directly related to this
sub-classification. Dessart ( 2008 ) assigns an error of @xmath when
using early-time spectra, and @xmath when using late-time spectra. We
refine this argument ramping up from 0.05 to 0.10, depending on the
number of spectra employed for each extinction determination. These
values are given in Table 3 in units of @xmath .

Figure 15 shows a comparison between the spectroscopic reddenings @xmath
(spec) and our color reddenings @xmath derived in § 6 , for the 17 SNe
belonging to the top three subclasses ( gold + silver + bronze ). A good
agreement is displayed between both techniques with a dispersion of
0.38 mag. The resulting @xmath suggests that this dispersion is
consistent with the combined errors between both techniques. The
exceptions are two objects: SN 1999br and SN 2003ho. The first object
(SN 1999br) only has plateau photometry making hard the determination of
@xmath . Although the error in @xmath is quite large (20 days), this
uncertainty does not have a great impact on the error of the \vi color
due to the flatness of the color curve at these epochs (+0.0024 per
day). Another cause for the disagreement is the extreme properties (low
luminosity and velocity) of this SN which might also have a \vi color
instrinsically redder than that of the bulk of the SNe. The second
discrepant object (SN 2003ho) belongs to the bronze group so it is
possible that the difference could be due to the use of a late-time of
the spectrum in the determination of the spectroscopic reddening.

Figure 16 shows the same comparison, but this time we include the
16 lowest-quality coal SNe. This inclusion clearly deteriorates the good
agreement seen in Fig. 15 from @xmath mag to @xmath mag ( @xmath ),
namely due to SN 1992af, SN 2003cx, SN 2003hd, and SN 2003fb. This
confirms the warning by Dessart ( 2008 ) , namely, that his
spectroscopic technique works much better with early-time spectra. The
large value of @xmath also suggests that the errors in the spectroscopic
reddenings derived from late-time spectra are underestimated.

Another way to estimate host-galaxy reddening is from the \nad @xmath
5893,5896 interstellar absorption doublet observed in the SN spectrum at
the host-galaxy redshift. Whenever the line was detected we measured its
equivalent width; in those cases where we did not detect the \nad line
we assigned it a null value. In all cases we estimated the uncertainty
in the equivalent width ( @xmath ) based on the signal-to-noise of the
continuum around this line. We converted these measurements into visual
extinctions @xmath ( \nad ) using the calibration of Barbon et al. (
1990 ) :

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (13)
  -- -------- -- ------

and tabulate our results in column 4 of Table 3 . The comparison between
@xmath ( \nad ) and our technique, shown in Figure 17 , exhibits a
dispersion of 0.53 mag ( @xmath ), which is much higher than the @xmath
=0.38 mag obtained from the previous comparison. The disagreement can be
attributed to the fact that the absorption line traces the gas content
along the line of sight, but does not necessarily probe dust (Munari &
Zwitter 1997 ) . Furthermore, reddenings derived from the EW of the \nad
lines measured from low-dispersion spectra simply cannot be expected to
be precise which is exactly our case. The basic problem is that the D
lines produced by a typical interstellar cloud are saturated (Hobbs 1974
) . The only way that one can hope to derive the reddening from the D
lines is via very high-dispersion spectra that resolve the lines and
allow the column density to be derived.

### 8 The Luminosity-Expansion Velocity relation

Armed with the dereddening method based on late-time colors we can now
revisit the \lumvel relation originally discovered by Hamuy & Pinto (
2002 ) which is at the core of the SCM. For this purpose we applied AKA
corrections (§ 4 ) to our photometry, we used our analytic fits (§ 5.1 )
to interpolate @xmath magnitudes on day --30, and we employed the CMB
redshifts ⁴ ⁴ 4 the CMB redshifts were computed by adding the
heliocentric redshifts given in Table 2 and the projection of the
velocity of the Sun relative to the CMB in the direction of the SN host
galaxy. For the latter we adopted a velocity of 371 \kmpsec in the
direction @xmath given by Fixsen et al. ( 1996 ) . in Table 4 to convert
apparent magnitudes to absolute values (assuming @xmath \dimho ). The
expansion velocities were determined from the minimum of the \ion Fe2
@xmath 5169 P-Cygni line profiles. We performed a power-law fit to
interpolate a velocity contemporaneous to the photometry (day –30) as
described in section 5.1 . From our original sample of 37 \sneiip we
were able to use 30 SNe to build this relation, since five of them do
not have \ion Fe2 velocities at day –30, and two others have extremely
low redshifts ( @xmath \kmpsec ).

Figure 18 shows the resulting \lumvel relation (absolute magnitude
versus expansion velocity) for all @xmath bands. Evidently we recover
the result of Hamuy & Pinto ( 2002 ) , namely that the most luminous SNe
have greater expansion velocities. In their case the data were modeled
with a linear function. Our sample suggests that the relation may be
quadratic, but we need more SNe at low expansion velocities to confirm
this suspicion. Linear least-squares fits to our @xmath data yields the
following solutions

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (14)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (15)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (16)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

which are shown with solid lines in Figure 18 .

The relation found by Hamuy & Pinto ( 2002 ) for the @xmath -band is
shown with the dashed line in the middle panel of the same figure. Given
that the study of Hamuy & Pinto ( 2002 ) was performed using data at
day 50 after the explosion (around day –60 in our time scale), it is not
unexpected that their \lumvel relation is shifted to higher expansion
velocities. Some of the difference in slope is explained by the
inclusion of SN 2003bl in our sample, which flattens the correlation.
This relation exhibits a dispersion of 0.3 mag, similar to that reported
before. This low scatter is very encouraging as it implies that the
expansion velocities can be used to predict the SN luminosities, to
standardize them, and to derive distances.

### 9 Hubble diagrams

The \lumvel relation shown in the previous section implies that a
spectroscopic measurement of the expansion velocity of a SN II-P can be
used to compute a corrected luminosity which should be approximately the
same for all SNe. We examine the reality of this property of \sneiip in
the magnitude-redshift Hubble diagram. For this purpose we employ \ion
Fe2 velocities (in units of \kmpsec ), @xmath apparent magnitudes
corrected for @xmath -terms, Galactic reddening, and host-galaxy
reddening determined from \vi colors, and host-galaxy redshifts in the
CMB frame. Table 4 lists these values for the 37 SNe of our sample, of
which 35 meet the requirement of being in the Hubble flow ( @xmath
\kmpsec ). A perfect distance indicator would describe a straight line
in the Hubble diagram, so the figure of merit to assess the performance
of this method is the dispersion from the fit. Along this section we use
dispersions weighted by the errors to evaluate the precision of the
Hubble diagrams.

#### 9.1 Using @xmath( \vi) and @xmath(spec)

The top left panel of Figure 19 shows a Hubble diagram constructed from
@xmath -band magnitudes interpolated to day –30 previously corrected for
Galactic extinctions and @xmath -terms. The top right panel shows
magnitudes additionally corrected for the \lumvel relation, the bottom
left panel includes further corrections for host-galaxy extinction
(using the \vi color calibration given in section 6 ). In each case we
perform a linear least-squares fit of the form,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (17)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the apparent magnitude corrected for @xmath -terms and
Galactic absorption, @xmath is the expansion velocity, @xmath is the
host-galaxy absorption, and @xmath is the CMB redshift. The only fitting
parameters are @xmath and @xmath ; in the top left panel we set @xmath
and we only fit for the zero point.

The dramatic decrease in the dispersion, from 0.72 to 0.36 mag clearly
demonstrates the benefitial effects of adding the velocity and
host-galaxy extinction terms. An inspection of the @xmath -band diagram
(Fig. 20 ) shows a large scatter of 0.54 mag in the top left panel. When
we correct for expansion velocities, the scatter drops to 0.50 mag. This
is certainly not unexpected given the \lumvel relation reported in the
previous section. It is encouraging to notice that the dispersion drops
from 0.50 to 0.45 mag when we include our host-galaxy extinction
corrections. This indicates the usefulness of our color-based
dereddening technique. The reduced @xmath value of 2.45 implies that
most of the scatter is accounted by the observational errors. We
performed the same analysis using other epochs and we found that day –30
yielded the lowest dispersion. This is also the day for which we reach
the maximum number of SNe in our HDs, i.e. moving backwards or forwards
in time means losing SNe data (velocity or magnitudes out of the
observation range).

If we turn our attention to the @xmath -band (Figure 21 ) the final
dispersion is 0.45 mag, identical to that found in the @xmath -band. It
seems that the dispersion could have some dependence on wavelength,
since it decreases from 0.45 in @xmath to 0.36 mag in @xmath . However,
it may be due to a sampling effect, because the @xmath diagrams have one
SN more than the @xmath diagram. The scatter of @xmath 0.4 mag in @xmath
is comparable but somewhat larger than the @xmath 0.34 dispersion
obtained in previous SCM studies (Hamuy & Pinto 2002 ; Hamuy 2003 ) . It
is important to notice that the dispersions are independent of the
intrinsic ( \vi ) @xmath color calculated in section 6 .

In the bottom right panels of Figs. 19 , 20 , and 21 we examine the SCM
using the spectroscopic reddenings determined by Dessart ( 2008 ) for a
set of 28 \sneiip (Table 3 ) instead of our color-based extinctions. The
resulting dispersions in @xmath are (0.67, 0.54, 0.42), which compare to
(0.36, 0.45, 0.45) when using color-based extinctions. All the fitting
parameters derived from both dereddening techniques are compiled in
Table 5 .

#### 9.2 Leaving @xmath as a free parameter

The previous analysis suggests that the dispersions are somewhat larger
than the observational errors. One possible source of scatter could be
the reddening law. As shown in § 6 and Fig. 12 we have evidence pointing
toward a somewhat different extinction law in the SN hosts compared to
the Galaxy. Here we take this idea a step further and we analyze the
Hubble diagram leaving @xmath as a free parameter. To accomplish this we
model the data with the following expression

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (18)
  -- -------- -- ------

Note that we are replacing @xmath in equation 17 with the term @xmath (
\vi ). The @xmath factor is a new free parameter to be marginalized
along with @xmath and @xmath , and \vi is the color on day –30 corrected
for @xmath -terms, Galactic extinction but uncorrected for host-galaxy
dust. Once @xmath is known we can used it to solve for host-galaxy
extinction from @xmath ( \vi ) @xmath , where 0.656 is the intrinsic \vi
color of \sneiip (see equations 11 and 12 in § 6 ).

Figure 22 shows the @xmath Hubble diagrams for our set of 30 \sneiip .
We get dispersions of (0.28, 0.31, 0.32) in @xmath respectively, which
compare to (0.36, 0.45, 0.45) when @xmath is kept fixed. The increase in
@xmath is due to the fact that we are not using the intrinsic color,
which gives the major contribution to the errors. Although we expect a
reduction in the scatter due to the inclusion of an additional
parameter, the large drop in the dispersion is remarkable. The last
three lines of Table 5 shows the parameters we obtain by minimizing the
dispersion in the HD for each band. When we restrict the sample to
objects with @xmath \kmpsec (leaving aside SNe with potentially greater
peculiar velocities), we end up with 19 SNe in the @xmath -band and
20 SNe in the @xmath bands. The resulting HDs in @xmath show dispersions
of (0.25, 0.28, 0.30), respectively. Not surprisingly these are lower
than the (0.28, 0.31, 0.32) dispersions obtained from the whole sample,
and the Hubble constant shows only a mild increase of 3%.

By definition the term @xmath ( \vi ) in equation 18 corresponds to the
extinction in a broad-band magnitude (with central wavelenth @xmath ).
Thus, @xmath is the ratio @xmath (see eq. 11 in § 6 ) and is related to
the shape of the extinction law. For each of the @xmath bands we used
our library of SNe II spectra to compute synthetically the value of
@xmath as a function of @xmath (see Figure 23 ). This allowed us to
convert the @xmath values resulting from our fits into @xmath values.
Our fits yield @xmath for the @xmath bands, which translate into @xmath
. These values are remarkably consistent to each other and significantly
lower than the @xmath value of the standard reddening law. Independent
evidence for a low @xmath law has been already reported from studies of
SNe Ia (see § EL MÉTODO DE PATRONES ESTANDARIZABLES PARA SUPERNOVAS TIPO
II-PLATEAU ).

The dispersion of 0.28–0.32 mag in the HDs translates into an accuracy
of 13–14% in the determination of distances. Although not as good as the
@xmath 7%–10% precision of SNe Ia (Phillips 1993 ; Hamuy et al. 1996 ;
Phillips et al. 1999 ) , this is a very encouraging result which
demonstrates that \sneiip have great potential to determine
extra-galactic distances, and therefore, cosmological parameters.

### 10 The Hubble constant

The Hubble constant is a parameter of central importance in cosmology
which can be determined from our Hubble diagrams. This can be
accomplished as long as we can convert apparent magnitudes into
distances. This calibration was done with two objects for which we found
Cepheid distances in the literature: SN 1999em ( @xmath ; Leonard et al.
2002 ) and SN 2004dj ( @xmath ; Freedman et al. 2001 ) . For each
calibrating SN we can solve for @xmath using the following expression

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (19)
  -- -------- -- ------

In this equation @xmath is the apparent magnitude corrected for Galactic
absorption and @xmath -terms, @xmath is the expansion velocity, and \vi
is the color of the calibrating SN, all measured on day –30 and given in
Table 4 ; @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath are the fitting parameters given
in the bottom three lines of Table 5 .

Table 6 summarizes our calculations for the two calibrators. This table
shows that the corrected @xmath absolute magnitudes of SN 1999em and
SN 2004dj differ from each other by 0.86–1.13 mag. This is somewhat
greater than the scatter of 0.3 mag in the \lumvel relation, but
statistically plausible. This can be seen in Figure 24 where we plot
with red dots the corrected absolute magnitudes of the two calibrating
SNe, on top of the whole sample of SNe employed in the HDs (black dots).
This difference leads to @xmath values in the range 62–105 \dimho . A
weighted average of the values of Table 6 yields a Hubble constant

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (20)
  -- -------- -- ------

This value compares very well with that derived by Freedman et al. (
2001 ) from SNe Ia ( @xmath \dimho ), and reasonable well with that
found by Sandage et al. ( 2006 ) ( @xmath \dimho ) with a similar
Type Ia sample. With only two calibrating SNe the SCM still has plenty
of room to deliver a more precise value for @xmath .

### 11 Distances

Armed with standardized absolute magnitudes for \sneiip , we are in a
position to calculate distances to all the SNe of our sample. This can
be done with the following expression

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (21)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the weighted mean of the corrected absolute magnitudes
of the two calibrating SNe given in Table 6 . The resulting values are
given in Table 7 for the 37 \sneiip . The last column of the table shows
the weighted averages of their distance moduli.

As mentioned in the introduction, we can evaluate the precision of the
SCM from a comparison with EPM distances. For this purpose we employ EPM
distances recently calculated by Jones et al. ( 2008 ) which are
summarized in Table 8 along with our distances for the 11 objects in
common between SCM and EPM. Jones et al. ( 2008 ) determine EPM
distances with two different sets of atmosphere models. The EPM
distances determined using the models of Eastman et al. ( 1996 ) (E96;
column 2) are 12% @xmath 5% shorter than our SCM distances. On the other
hand, the EPM distances determined using the models of Dessart & Hillier
( 2005 ) (D05; column 3) are 40% @xmath 10% greater than our SCM
distances. These shifts are calculated weighting by the error in the EPM
and SCM distances. These systematic differences can be clearly seen in
the upper panel of Figure 25 , and more clearly in the fractional
differences @xmath plotted in the bottom panel.

The systematic differences among the two sets of EPM distances can be
solely attributed to the atmosphere models of E96 and D05. New radiative
transfer models of \sneiip are necessary to understand the origin of
this discrepancy. Besides the systematic errors in both EPM
implementations, we can get an understanding of the internal precision
of EPM and SCM after removing the systematic differences and bringing
all distances to a common scale. For this purpose we correct the EPM
distances to the SCM distance scale by removing the percentage shifts of
1.40 and 0.88. The comparison is shown in Figure 26 . The distance
differences have dispersions of @xmath 13% and @xmath 16% using D05 and
E96 respectively. This implies that either SCM or EPM produce relative
distances with an internal precision between 13–16%. This agrees with
the dispersions of 0.25–0.30 mag seen in the HDs restricted to SNe with
@xmath \kmpsec .

## Chapter \thechapter Discussion

### 12 Variations of the extinction law

The reddening law that minimizes the dispersion in the @xmath Hubble
diagrams ( @xmath ) turns out to be very different than the standard
Galactic extinction law ( @xmath ; Cardelli et al. 1989 ) . To our
knowledge this is the first study of the interstellar extinction in
external galaxies based on \sneiip . On the other hand, there have been
several studies on this subject using Type Ia SNe. Most recently,
Folatelli et al. ( 2008 ) solved for @xmath in a similar manner to our
approach, i.e., by minimizing the dispersion in the Hubble diagram and
obtained a value of @xmath , remarkably consistent with our value.
Altavilla et al. ( 2004 ) and Reindl et al. ( 2005 ) applied a similar
procedure by minimizing the dispersion in the @xmath relation for SNe Ia
and found @xmath ranging between 3.5 and 3.7, significantly smaller than
the standard value of 4.3. An even smaller value of @xmath was found by
Capaccioli et al. ( 1990 ) based on the same kind of analysis for
SNe Ia. Further evidence for low @xmath values were reported by Phillips
et al. ( 1999 ) and Knop et al. ( 2003 ) . Studies of individual Type Ia
SNe, such as SN 1999cl (Krisciunas et al. 2007 ) , SN 2003cg (Elias-Rosa
et al. 2006 ) , SN 2002cv (Elias-Rosa et al. 2008 ) , and SN 2006X (Wang
et al. 2008 ) also yielded low values around @xmath . Other studies of
dust reddening based on diverse methods were performed to nearby
galaxies obtaining values for @xmath ranging between 2.4 and 4.3
(Rifatto 1990 ; Della Valle & Fanagia 1992 ; Brosch & Loinger 1991 ) .
The ratio of total to selective absorption varies significantly between
@xmath even within our own Galaxy (Clayton & Cardelli 1988 ) . A lower
value of @xmath could be due to dust grains smaller than those in our
Galaxy, since for a given value of @xmath the @xmath reddening decreases
if the size of the grains grows. On the other hand, Wang ( 2005 )
suggests the idea that scattering by dust clouds located in the
circumstellar medium of the SN tends to reduce the effective @xmath in
the optical. This effect should be opposite in the ultraviolet, hence it
could be further tested with photometry at these wavelenghts.

### 13 @xmath comparison with other methods

The HDs constructed from the \vi color at day –30 as the extinction
estimator (§ 9.1 ) give values of @xmath between 70–73 \dimho , which
turn out to be very similar to those derived from the HDs where we leave
@xmath as a free parameter ( @xmath \dimho ). This shows that if we use
\vi color based extinctions, the value of the Hubble constant is not be
too sensitive to the adopted @xmath .

Table 9 summarizes several modern measurements of the expansion rate of
the Universe, @xmath , derived from different methods: SNe Ia, EPM and
SCM for \sneiip , the Tully-Fisher relation, tip of the red giant branch
(TRGB) distances, the surface brightness fluctuations (SBF) method, and
the “fundamental plane” method for early type galaxies. According to
Table 9 the value of the Hubble constant ranges between 52–82 \dimho ,
and the most accepted value today is 70 \dimho , which is in very good
agreement with our SCM value of @xmath \dimho .

This study shows that the SCM can deliver accurate distances. The @xmath
Hubble diagrams yield scatter of 0.3 mag which implies a precision in
individual distances @xmath 15%. Part of this scatter could be due to
the peculiar velocities of the SN host galaxies and the intrinsic
precision of SCM could be even lower than this. In fact, when we perform
a comparison for SNe in common between SCM and EPM, the distance
differences range between 13–16% (after removing the systematic
differencce among the SCM and EPM). This comparison is independent of
the SN host-galaxy redshifts and implies that the internal precision in
any of these two techniques must be lower than 13–16%, since these
differences comprise the combined uncertainties of both methods. This is
an encouraging result, since it implies that both EPM and SCM can
produce high precision relative distances, thus offering a new route to
cosmological parameters.

### 14 Final remarks

We note that the dispersion in the HDs increases with wavelength. This
seems contrary to expectations given that 1) the extinction effects
decrease with wavelength, and 2) metallicity affects the @xmath -band.
Perhaps the luminosity is not only a function of velocity but also of
metallicity, i.e., @xmath . If so, the velocity term in eqs. 17 – 18
might be removing metallicity effects, more efficientlyat shorter
wavelengths. This could be tested with [Fe/H] measurements of the
Type II-P SNe. We plan to address this issue in the near future. Given
the evidence we have, we can only claim a dependence of @xmath with
@xmath . The obvious physical explanation is that the internal energy is
correlated with the kinetic energy. The implication is that the ratio
between the internal energy and kinetic energy is approximately
independent of the explosion energy.

## Chapter \thechapter Conclusions

We established a library of 196 SN II optical spectra and developed a
code which allows us to correct the observed photometry for Galactic
extinction, @xmath -terms and host-galaxy extinction. We applied our
code to the @xmath photometry of 37 \sneiip (§ 4 ). We developed fitting
procedures to the light curves, color curves and velocity curves which
allow us to precisely determine the transition time between the plateau
and the tail phases. The use of this parameter as the time origin
permited us to line up the SNe to a common phase. The additional benefit
of these fits is the interpolation of magnitudes, colors and velocities
over a wide range of epochs. The methodology explained above yields the
following conclusions:

1.  The comparison between our color-based dereddening technique and the
    spectroscopic reddenings of Dessart ( 2008 ) is satisfactory within
    the errors of both techniques. This is particularly encouraging
    since our method uses late-time photometric information, while the
    other method uses early-time spectroscopic data, i.e. completely
    independent information.

2.  Using our new sample of SNe we recover the luminosity-velocity trend
    ( \lumvel relation) previously reported by Hamuy & Pinto ( 2002 ) .

3.  We construct @xmath HDs using two sets of host-galaxy reddenings. We
    demonstrated that the ( \vi )-based extinctions do a much better job
    than the spectroscopic determinations by Dessart ( 2008 ) , reaching
    dispersions of @xmath 0.4 mag in the Hubble diagrams. This scatter
    is somewhat higher than that found previously by Hamuy ( 2003 ) of
    0.35 mag. A much smaller dispersion of 0.3 mag was achieved when we
    used \vi colors to estimate reddening and allowed @xmath to vary. We
    obtain @xmath , much smaller than the Galactic value of 3.1. The low
    value of @xmath can be explained by a different nature of the dust
    grains in host-galaxies along the line of sight to Type II-P SNe.

4.  We derive a Hubble constant of @xmath \dimho from @xmath photometry,
    calibrating our HDs with Cepheid distances to SN 1999em and
    SN 2004dj, which agrees very well with the value obtained by the HST
    Key Project (Freedman et al. 2001 ) .

5.  Finally, we calculate the distance moduli to our SN sample, and make
    a comparison against EPM distances from Jones et al. ( 2008 ) . The
    11 SNe in common show a systematic difference in distance between
    EPM and SCM, depending on the atmosphere models employed by EPM.
    Correcting for these shifts we bring the EPM distances to the SCM
    distance scale, from which we measure a dispersion of 13–16%. This
    spread reflects the combined internal precision of EPM and SCM.
    Therefore the internal precision in any of these two techniques must
    be @xmath 13–16%.

This analysis reconfirms the usefulness of \sneiip as cosmological
probes, providing strong encouragement to future high- @xmath studies.
We found that one can determine relative distances from \sneiip with a
precision of 15% or better. This uncertainty could be further reduced by
including more SNe in the Hubble flow. In its current form the SCM
requires both photometric and spectroscopic data. Since the latter are
expensive to obtain (especially at high- @xmath ) it would be desirable
to look for a photometric observable as a luminosity indicator instead
of the expansion velocities.

## Chapter \thechapter The Computation of Synthetic Magnitudes

The implementation of SCM requires the implementation of AKA corrections
to the observed SN magnitudes (§ 4 ). This process involves synthesizing
broadband magnitudes from the library of \sneiip spectra. It is crucial,
therefore, to place the synthetic magnitudes on the same photometric
system employed in the observations of the SN.

Since the SN magnitudes are measured with photon detectors, a synthetic
magnitude is the convolution of the observed photon number distribution,
@xmath , with the filter transmission function @xmath , i.e.,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (22)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the zero point for the magnitude scale and @xmath is the
wavelength in the observer’s frame.

For an adequate use of equation 22 , S( @xmath ) must include the
transparency of the Earth’s atmosphere, the filter transmission, and the
detector quantum efficiency (QE). For @xmath I adopt the filter
functions @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath published by Bessell ( 1990
) . However, since these curves are meant for use with energy and not
photon distributions (see Appendix in  Bessell 1983 ) , I must divide
them by @xmath before employing them in equation 22 . Also, since these
filters do not include the atmospheric telluric lines, I add these
features to the @xmath and @xmath filters (in @xmath and @xmath there
are no prominent telluric features) using my own atmospheric
transmission spectrum. Figure 27 shows the resulting curves.

The @xmath in eq. 22 must be determined by forcing the synthetic
magnitude of a star to match its observed magnitude. I use the
spectrophotometric calibration of Vega published by Hayes ( 1985 ) in
the range 3300-10405 Å and the @xmath magnitude of 0.03 mag measured by
Johnson et al. ( 1966 ) , from which I solve for the @xmath in the
@xmath -band. In principle, I can use the same procedure for @xmath ,
but Vega’s photometry in these bands is not very reliable as it was
obtained in the old Johnson standard system. To avoid these problems I
employ ten stars with excellent spectrophotometry (Hamuy et al. 1992,
1994 ) and photometry in the modern Kron-Cousins system (Cousins 1971 ,
1980 , 1984 ) . Before using these standards I remove the telluric lines
from the spectra since the filter functions already include these
features. With this approach I obtain an average and more reliable zero
point for the synthetic magnitude scale with rms uncertainty of @xmath
0.01 mag. With these @xmath s I find that the synthetic magnitudes of
Vega are brighter than the observed magnitudes (Johnson et al. 1966 ) by
0.016 mag in @xmath , 0.025 in @xmath , and 0.023 in @xmath (see Table
10 ), which is not so surprising considering that this comparison
requires transforming the Johnson @xmath magnitudes to the Kron-Cousins
system (Taylor 1986 ) . Figure 28 shows the adopted spectrophotometric
calibration for Vega.

Table 10 summarizes the zero points computed with eq. 22 , and the
corresponding magnitudes for Vega in such system. For the proper use of
these @xmath s it is necessary to express @xmath in sec @xmath cm @xmath
cm @xmath and @xmath in Å. From the ten secondary standards I estimate
that the uncertainty in the zero points is @xmath 0.01 mag in @xmath .

## Chapter \thechapter Finding @xmath using the DSM in Multidimensions

Given the 8-parameter function we have to deal with (refer to @xmath in
eq. 5 ), we had to explore different methods of multidimensional
minimization. The Downhill Simplex Method (DSM) ⁵ ⁵ 5 Consult for
further details Numerical Recipes in Fortran (chapter 10.4; Press et al.
1992 ) as the main bibliographic reference of this appendix. , due to
Nelder & Mead ( 1965 ) , does not use one-dimensional minimization as a
part of their computational strategy. Derivatives are not required, only
function evaluations. Its funcionality is based on the simplex, a
geometrical figure consisting in @xmath dimensions, of @xmath vertices,
all their interconecting line segments, and polygonal faces. For
example, in 2-dimensional space a simplex is a triangle. The starting
guess should not be just a single point, but @xmath , defining an
initial simplex. The DSM now takes a series of steps (shown in Figure 29
), most steps just moving the vertice of the simplex where the function
is largest through the opposite face of the simplex to a vertice with a
lower value of the function. The routine amoeba , called after the
unicellular organism, tries to “swallow” the minimum being intended to
be descriptive of this kind of behavior. The hungry amoeba is the
simplex which is “fed” with minima. The purpose after a few step is the
reduction of the @xmath -dimensional volume of the simplex as shown in
Fig. 29 for the 3D case. Hence the minimum gets enclosed and finally
found with an accuracy given by the size of the simplex.

The input parameters for the Fortran version of this routine are the
following

amoeba (isimplex[mp,np],y[mp],mp,np,ndim,ftol,funk,iter)

where

     isimplex[mp,np] : the matrix containing the coordinates of the
    initial simplex, np+1 vertices defined by a np -dimensional vector

     y[mp] : vector composed by the value function evaluated in each of
    the np+1 initial vertices (rows) of isimplex

     mp = np + 1

     np = ndim

     ndim : number of dimensions or variables of the function
    (parameters to be fitted)

     ftol : the fractional convergence tolerance to be achieved in the
    value of the function

     funk : function of the form funk(x) where x[mp] is a np+1
    -dimensional vector

     iter : total number of function evaluations after the convergence

The output consists of the isimplex matrix and the y vector overwritten
by np+1 new points all within a tolerance ftol of the minimum function
value, whereas the number of function evaluations is saved in iter .
Thus, the result is a new and smaller simplex containing the minimum.
This procedure guarantees a succesful search of at least a local minimum
value of the function.

In our specific case we want to minimize @xmath as a function of the
parameter vector @xmath , which is written as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (23)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the function defined in eq. 8 whose role is to model the
\sneiip light curves. ( @xmath ) is the observed magnitude of the SN
with its associated uncertainty for a given Julian date @xmath , all
together completing a total of @xmath measurements that, basically, draw
the observed SN light curve.

Although simple and user-friendly, the DSM finds problems working on an
8-dimensional space but not as most algorithm would do. In most cases
the initial simplex has to be accurately defined according to the
desired results. In order to make a semi-automatic search for the
initial simplex, we introduce new parameters in the minimization
routine. From the photometric observations we extract the date of the
first data point @xmath , and using a simple algorithm we calculate the
approximate end of the plateau @xmath (refer to § 5.1 ). By means of
these calculations we constrain the @xmath -parameters having temporal
components. In order to contract the magnitude component of the @xmath
-parameters we extract from the photometry the brightest and the dimmest
magnitude, @xmath and @xmath respectively. For example, below is shown
the initial simplex we feed into amoeba to fit the V light curve of
SN 1999em,

  -- -- -- ------
           (24)
  -- -- -- ------

where the rows are the 9 initial vertices of the simplex in the
8-parameter coordinate system. This is one structure of the many one can
choose to build the isimplex that gives us the best convergence. Each
filter requires slightly different parameter ranges. By averaging the
vertices of the final converging simplex, we obtain a unique parameter
vector with its corresponding uncertainty vector calculated from the
dispersions of the 9 vertices around the mean. The resulting fits for
SN 1999em are shown in the upper-right panel of Fig. 4 and the
corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 11 .
