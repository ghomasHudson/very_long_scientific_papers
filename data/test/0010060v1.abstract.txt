What are the information processing capabilities of physical systems?

As recently as the first half of the @xmath century this question did
not even have a definite meaning. What is information, and how would one
process it? It took the development of theories of computing (in the
1930s) and information (late in the 1940s) for us to formulate
mathematically what it means to compute or communicate.

Yet these theories were abstract, based on axiomatic mathematics: what
did physical systems have to do with these axioms? Rolf Landauer had the
essential insight — “Information is physical” — that information is
always encoded in the state of a physical system, whose dynamics on a
microscopic level are well-described by quantum physics. This means that
we cannot discuss information without discussing how it is represented,
and how nature dictates it should behave.

Wigner considered the situation from another perspective when he wrote
about “the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural
sciences”. Why are the computational techniques of mathematics so
astonishingly useful in describing the physical world [ 1 ] ? One might
begin to suspect foul play in the universe’s operating principles.

Interesting insights into the physics of information accumulated through
the 1970s and 1980s — most sensationally in the proposal for a “quantum
computer”. If we were to mark a particular year in which an explosion of
interest took place in information physics, that year would have to be
1994, when Shor showed that a problem of practical interest
(factorisation of integers) could be solved easily on a quantum
computer. But the applications of information in physics — and vice
versa — have been far more widespread than this popular discovery. These
applications range from improved experimental technology, more
sophisticated measurement techniques, methods for characterising the
quantum/classical boundary, tools for quantum chaos, and deeper insight
into quantum theory and nature.

In this thesis I present a short review of ideas in quantum information
theory. The first chapter contains introductory material, sketching the
central ideas of probability and information theory. Quantum mechanics
is presented at the level of advanced undergraduate knowledge, together
with some useful tools for quantum mechanics of open systems. In the
second chapter I outline how classical information is represented in
quantum systems and what this means for agents trying to extract
information from these systems. The final chapter presents a new
resource: quantum information. This resource has some bewildering
applications which have been discovered in the last ten years, and
continually presents us with unexpected insights into quantum theory and
the universe.

This thesis was begun as an intrepid adventure. It caught me quite
unexpectedly: a suggestion from a friend who heard quantum computing was
the next big thing; some enquiries as to whether anybody in South Africa
would be interested in supervising this “fringe” science; and then
suddenly I moved town, university and field within one month.

I owe most of the success of this venture to three people: Professor
Hendrik Geyer, Chris Fuchs and Marcelle Olivier.

Professor Geyer — who had dabbled in the quantum computing literature —
agreed to supervise a thesis in quantum computing which subsequently
evolved into the present work. He has provided an excellent example to
me of a scientist, a leader in science and as an intellectual.

My correspondence with Chris Fuchs only began a few months before the
completion of this thesis, but I have felt his presence since meeting
him in Turin and delving through his contributions to quantum
information theory. His support and input have been rewarding and
enlightening.

Marcelle, as a perfectionist herself, indulged me in my fits of writing,
reading and not doing enough work. She is my muse.

Thanks are also due to my various colleagues at the Instituut vir
Teoretiese Fisika: Andrew van Biljon (who’s always been here), Leandro
Boonzaaier, Lucian Anton, Professor Frikkie Scholtz and Jacques Kotze. I
gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the National Research
Foundation, in particular for the funds made available for my attendance
at the TMR Network summer school on quantum computing and quantum
information theory in Turin, Italy in 1999. Thanks also to my parents,
who are a little bewildered at what I do (and would prefer it if I were
making money) but love me anyway. Many more people have helped and
encouraged me during my time at Stellenbosch — and before — and their
contribution to making me is also appreciated.

And to Debbie, who watched me suddenly develop into a Quantum Computer
Scientist after her brother mentioned it.
