This chapter deals with black holes in anti de Sitter spaces. The latter
are the simplest non flat solutions to Einsteinâ€™s equations with
constant negative cosmological constant; they are in particular
pseudo-Riemannian manifolds that carry a causal structure, physically
due to the finiteness of speed of light. That physical restriction is
mathematically encoded by the existence of three types of geodesics: the
space-, time- and light-like ones, existence which is in turn implied by
the non positivity of the metric. A causal structure is introduced by
defining two points as causally connected when there exists a time- or
light-like path connecting them.

The originality of our approach is that the @xmath -dimensional space
@xmath is seen as a quotient of groups @xmath , and that the special
causal black hole structure is described in terms of orbits of the
action of a subgroup of the isometry group of the manifold.

Using symmetric spaces techniques, we show that closed orbits of the
Iwasawa subgroup of @xmath naturally define a causal black hole
singularity in anti de Sitter spaces in @xmath dimensions. In
particular, we recover for @xmath the non-rotating massive BTZ black
hole. The method presented here is very simple and in principle
generalizable to any semisimple symmetric space.
