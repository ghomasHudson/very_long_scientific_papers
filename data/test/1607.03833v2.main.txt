## Introduction

### Foreword

The results summarized here are intended as rigorous mathematical
statements on various physical models coming from condensed matter
physics, statistical mechanics (classical and quantum), quantum field
theory and cold atoms physics. The main tools are mostly those of the
mathematical analyst: partial differential equations, functional
analysis, spectral theory, calculus of variations, with some incursions
into probability theory. A running thread is the construction, by
rigorous asymptotic analysis most of the time, of bridges between
different levels of mathematical modeling of physical phenomena.

In choosing a title for this memoir I have followed an interesting piece
of advice put forward in [ 182 ] . Quoting Sergiu Klainerman: “I think
we need to reevaluate our current preconception about what subjects we
consider as belonging properly within Mathematics.” Personally, I would
also agree to the same statement had “Physics” been substituted for
“Mathematics”.

The pun with “Many-body quantum mathematics”, as compared with
“Many-body quantum physics” or “Many-body quantum mechanics”, stresses
that the mathematical analysis of models and problems from many-body
physics has long since grown into a field of its own, within the more
general mathematical physics literature.

There is an ever-going debate trying to decide whether the latter field
consists of the intersection of mathematics with physics, or of their
union, or something in between. I could personally be happy with the
conservative alternative, namely the intersection. It is my impression
however that the overlap is considerably larger than usually agreed on.
In particular, all the material discussed in the sequel fits therein.

‘‘Many-body quantum mathematics’’ provides a unifying theme every
chapter can be loosely related to, although not all deal with quantum
mechanics and not all with many-body theory. It is my hope that the
contributions summarized in this memoir will be of interest not only to
pure mathematical physicists ¹ ¹ 1 A “purely interdisciplinary” field
seems to contain somewhat of a contradiction anyway. but also to
mathematicians and physicists with an interest in rigorous mathematical
foundations of physical theories.

Let me emphasize that, this being a habilitation thesis, everything
contained herein is completely and (almost) unashamedly biased towards
my own work. Only papers to which I contributed (all in collaboration
with subsets of the co-authors list on the front page) are discussed in
some detail, along with the necessary elements of context and
perspective.

This memoir is thus not a review paper: contributions by other authors
are of course mentioned when appropriate, but I have neither tried to be
exhaustive nor to give the amount of details that would be required. I
still hope that this text can be useful to an extended readership, in
particular because some of the chapters contain the first streamlined
discussion (as opposed to the original research papers) of projects I
have been involved in. Any comment is welcome and can be sent to the
author by email.

### Content of Chapter 1

Papers 1 and 2, joint work with Mathieu Lewin.

A polaron is the quasi-particle formed by the interaction between a
charged particle and a deformation of an underlying polarizable medium.
We shall discuss a new model for coupling several charged particles to a
mean-field theory of an infinite quantum crystal. The model for the
latter is microscopic. We may thus describe the small polaron regime
where the immersed particles’ extension is comparable to the crystal’s
lattice spacing.

We first study the well-posedness of the new model, at the level of the
ground state. We prove binding (existence of a ground state) for a
single polaron and reduce the question of binding for several polarons
to the study of HVZ-type inequalities. Physically, this corresponds to
the fact that each polaron is trapped in a polarization field it creates
in the medium.

Next, we consider the macroscopic limit of the new model. When the
immersed polarons live on a scale much larger than the underlying
crystal’s lattice spacing, we recover the Landau-Pekar-Tomasevich model.
In this description, the polarons interact with a continuous polarizable
medium, characterized by the crystal’s dielectric matrix.

### Content of Chapter 2

Papers 3, 8, 12 and 18, joint work with Michele Correggi.

We study two related mean-field models for the response of
superfluids/superconductors to external gauge fields.

In Section 2.1 we address the nucleation of vortex lattices in rotating
Bose-Einstein condensates, within the framework of 2D Gross-Pitaevskii
theory. We consider an asymptotic limit corresponding to strong
interparticle interactions, with the rotation frequency tuned so as to
capture the critical value where vortices first appear. In this regime,
vortices are tightly packed in the condensate and their density is
inhomogeneous. We investigate their distribution’s subtle dependence on
the underlying matter density profile via the derivation of an effective
electrostatic model. As expected, for large rotation speeds (compared to
the first critical value), the vortex density fills the whole sample and
becomes homogeneous.

In Section 2.2 we focus on the surface superconductivity regime of type
II superconductors. In this phase, the sample is normal in the bulk but
superconductivity persists close to the boundary. We use 2D
Ginzburg-Landau theory to obtain a detailed description of the
phenomenon, in the asymptotic limit of “extreme-type II
superconductors”. We derive a limit model for the distribution of
superconductivity along the boundary, deducing a few important facts:
absence of normal inclusions in the surface superconductivity layer,
estimate of the phase circulation along the boundary, description of the
order parameter’s dependence on the curvature of the sample’s boundary.

### Content of Chapter 3

Papers 4, 5, 10 and 14, joint work with Sylvia Serfaty and Jakob
Yngvason.

The Laughlin wave-function and its descendants form the basis of our
current understanding of the fractional quantum Hall effect. They
describe strongly correlated quantum fluids, where the interplay between
a strong external magnetic field and repulsive interactions forces a
very special and rigid form on the ground state of a 2D many-body
system. Most of the chapter is concerned with the response of the
Laughlin state to external fields modeling trapping and/or disorder.

We first discuss results bearing on a model for trapped rotating bosons,
where we investigate the effect of varying the shape of the trapping
potential. This is motivated by experimental issues, in particular the
instability of the system due to the centrifugal force.

Then we turn to a more general study of incompressibility/rigidity
properties. We formulate and prove some asymptotic bounds, coined
“incompressibility estimates”. Those give some rigorous basis to the
conjectured stiffness of the Laughlin state in its reaction to external
fields. The proofs proceed via an analogy with the 2D Coulomb gas
(one-component plasma), and generalizations thereof.

### Content of Chapter 4

Paper 7, joint work with Sylvia Serfaty.

The classical Coulomb gas is a much studied model of statistical
mechanics, both for its own sake (that is, as a basic model for bulk
matter and trapped plasmas) and for its relation to other fields (random
matrix theory, classical and quantum vortices, the fractional quantum
Hall effect …). In this chapter we investigate the ground and thermal
states of the trapped Coulomb gas, in any spatial dimension larger than
two, and in the mean-field regime. We characterize fluctuations around
mean-field theory in terms of a “renormalized jellium energy” giving the
energy per unit volume of an infinite system of point charges in a
neutralizing background. We obtain an asymptotic expansion of the ground
state configurations, showing that the renormalized jellium energy
governs the distribution of charges at the microscopic scale. We next
prove large deviations estimates for the Gibbs states at small enough
temperature. We also use the renormalized energy to derive new estimates
on the local charge deviations and correlation functions.

### Content of Chapter 5

Papers 6, 9, 11, 15 and 17, joint work with Mathieu Lewin, Phan Thành
Nam and Robert Seiringer.

This long chapter is devoted to a summary of several related works on
the interacting Bose gas, in connection with the Bose-Einstein
condensation phenomenon. We introduced a general method, based on (new
versions of) the quantum de Finetti theorem, in order to derive
mean-field descriptions of the ground state of a generic Bose system. We
avoid as much as possible to rely on specific properties of physical
models, using instead structural results on large bosonic states. This
allows to treat a large variety of models and scaling limits in a
unified way. For so-called mean-field limits, essentially no other
ingredient is needed to derive non-linear Schrödinger models from
many-body quantum mechanics. For the more delicate dilute limits, we
have to rely in addition on some new many-body estimates for the ground
states of specific models, but the general strategy still constitutes
the backbone of the proofs.

### Content of Chapter 6

Paper 13, joint work with Mathieu Lewin and Phan Thành Nam.

Here we move on to studying thermal states of the interacting Bose gas,
with the long-term goal of discussing the Bose-Einstein phase
transition. For an interacting gas, this is a very delicate problem, and
we mostly obtain preliminary results. The general strategy is to relate,
in a mean-field limit with an appropriate scaling of the temperature,
many-body Gibbs states to non-linear Gibbs measures (classical field
theory). This is a semi-classical limit, which requires specific tools
(inter alias, a new Berezin-Lieb inequality), in addition to the quantum
de Finetti theorem previously alluded to. For the 1D Bose gas we obtain
a full derivation of the non-linear Gibbs measure based on the
mean-field energy functional. For larger spatial dimensions, well-known
obstructions to the measure’s construction lead us to consider
simplified models, with a smooth interaction. The analysis is
nevertheless highly non trivial because the limit objects are not
trace-class operators.

### Content of Chapter 7

Papers 16 and 19, joint work with Douglas Lundholm.

Anyons are (hitherto hypothetical) quantum particles with statistical
properties not falling in the ubiquitous bosons/fermions dichotomy. They
have been conjectured to emerge as quasi-particles of low-dimensional
systems. One of the most promising candidate physical systems comes from
fractional quantum Hall physics: it is widely believed that the
elementary excitations of the Laughlin (and related) states should
behave as anyons. In this chapter we do two things:

First, we give a new argument for the emergence of anyon statistics, in
the context of the Laughlin phase. While not mathematically rigorous, we
believe that the derivation settles some issues with previous arguments.
In brief, we show that tracer particles in a Laughlin liquid, by
coupling to quasi-holes of the Laughlin wave-function, acquire an
emergent anyonic behavior.

We next consider the rigorous derivation of simplified models for 2D
anyon systems. Because of the intricacies of the many-anyons problem,
there is a crucial need for those. We make a step in this direction by
rigorously deriving an effective one-body energy functional for almost
bosonic anyons. Its main unusual feature is that it contains a
self-consistent magnetic field. The general proof strategy is inspired
by that of Chapter 5 , but the peculiarities of the anyon Hamiltonian
require some specific tools and techniques.

## Chapter 1 Polarons in quantum crystals

In condensed matter physics (see e.g. [ 12 ] ), one calls a polaron the
system formed by the interaction between a crystal and a charged
particle (an electron, most of the time). Similarly, one calls
multi-polaron the system formed by several charged particles interacting
among themselves and with a crystal. A remarkable fact is the
possibility to obtain bound states in such a situation. Indeed, in
vacuum, the dispersive nature of the quantum kinetic energy and the
Coulomb repulsion between particles of the same charge prevent bound
states of electrons from being energetically favorable. The interaction
with the crystal results in an attractive force that allows electrons to
form a stable bound state. Roughly, the mechanism is the following: each
electron creates a local polarization of the crystal’s atoms by
attracting their nuclei and repelling their electrons. This local
polarization around each electron is in turn felt by the other electrons
forming the multi-polaron. The effective interaction thus mediated by
the crystal can eventually overcome the Coulomb repulsion between the
charged particles one adds to the crystal.

The polaron is the effective quasi-particle formed by the electron added
to the crystal, together with the polarization field it creates by
locally moving the crystal’s charges. The dressing of the electron by
the interaction with the Fermi sea of the crystal is somewhat similar to
the dressing all actual electrons experience through their interaction
with the “fictitious” particles of the Dirac sea in quantum
electrodynamics. In the following presentation we shall refer to the
charged quantum particles added to an otherwise stable quantum crystal
as “polarons”, in order to distinguish them from the electrons of the
crystal, which will not be modeled on the same footing.

In this chapter, which summarizes the findings of [ 211 , 212 ] , we
discuss a new polaron model obtained by coupling the @xmath -body
Schrödinger equation with a mean-field model of a quantum crystal with a
charge defect. The main results are:

-   existence of bound states, i.e. minimizers of the energy functional
    of the model.

-   derivation of the Pekar functional from the new model, in a
    macroscopic limit.

The present exposition is based on [ 298 ] where the french reader can
find a more detailed review of the context and results.

### 1.1. Models for quantum crystals

#### 1.1.1. The perfect crystal

Our model for the host quantum crystal is Born-Oppenheimer-like, in that
the nuclei are considered as fixed classical particles, but the
electrons as mobile quantum particles that optimize their configuration
to take the nuclei’s distribution into account. The electron’s
configuration is determined within a mean-field approximation, through
the minimization of a reduced Hartree-Fock (a.k.a. Hartree) functional.

Let thus @xmath be a positive measure on @xmath , periodic with respect
to a given lattice @xmath corresponding to the nuclei’s periodic
arrangement. We should first give a meaning to the reduced Hartree-Fock
functional

  -- -- -- ---------
           (1.1.1)
  -- -- -- ---------

giving the energy of a given infinite electron configuration. Here,
@xmath is a reduced one-particle density matrix, a self-adjoint,
positive, trace-class operator on @xmath . Identifying @xmath with its
kernel, we denote @xmath the corresponding one-body density. The above
is a mean-field model where correlations beyond those imposed by the
Pauli principle are neglected. The first term is the quantum kinetic
energy, the second one the Coulomb attraction to the nuclei, and the
third one the Coulomb repulsion between electrons. Note the absence of
an exchange term, which would be of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and would render the functional non-convex in @xmath . We neglect such a
term for several reasons, both physical (it usually plays a second order
role) and mathematical (due to its non-convexity, the behavior of the
functional including exchange is much more involved). The one-body
density matrix @xmath should satisfy

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

as appropriate for fermions (this inequality embodies the Pauli
exclusion principle).

The first challenge here is that we want to see the crystal as an
ambient medium. To avoid boundary effects we have to give a meaning to
the above energy functional for an infinite locally neutral system of
nuclei and electrons. This is done by considering a thermodynamic limit
(infinite volume with fixed charge density) as in [ 233 , 57 , 58 , 59 ]
. The variational problem obtained by this procedure is posed on the set
of one-body density matrices that commute with the translations of the
lattice @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the set of bounded operators on some Hilbert space
@xmath . The energy (per unit volume) can then be given a meaning
through Bloch-Floquet theory [ 285 ] . We will not recall all the
details. Most relevant for the forthcoming discussion of the polaron
model is the Euler-Lagrange equation of the infinite-volume energy
functional. It is established in [ 59 , 52 ] that the unique minimizing
density matrix @xmath satisfies

  -- -- -- ---------
           (1.1.4)
  -- -- -- ---------

with @xmath the associated density and @xmath the Lagrange multiplier
(or chemical potential, or Fermi level). Here @xmath denotes the
spectral projector up to the Fermi level @xmath . The interpretation
of ( 1.1.4 ) is as follows: because of the Pauli principle,
non-interacting electrons fill the successive energy levels of their
Hamiltonian. In the presence of mean-field interactions, the electrons
of the crystal feel an effective self-consistent Hamiltonian @xmath and
fill its energy levels up to the Fermi level. The latter is set so as to
ensure local neutrality of the crystal.

In all the following we assume that the host crystal is an insulator,
i.e. that the spectrum of @xmath (made of Bloch band) has gaps, and that
the Fermi level @xmath lies in one of those.

#### 1.1.2. Crystal with local charge defects

The natural idea to insert polarons in the previous model is to see them
as a local charge defect in an otherwise perfect crystal. To this end,
we make use of the model introduced in [ 52 , 53 ] where the energy of
the crystal in presence of a defect is defined by reference to that of
the perfect crystal discussed previously. The following description is
inspired by the works [ 62 , 63 , 149 , 150 , 151 ] where the energy of
relativistic particles in the presence of a Dirac sea of virtual
electrons is rigorously defined (see [ 152 , 202 ] for reviews).

In the presence of a charge defect @xmath perturbing the periodic nuclei
density @xmath , we write the density matrix @xmath of the crystal’s
electrons as a perturbation of the density matrix of the perfect
crystal:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The energy as a function of @xmath is given by the formal computation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

the Coulomb interaction energy and @xmath the charge density associated
with @xmath . Of course, in infinite volume, both terms of the left-hand
side of ( 1.1.5 ) are infinite. One can however give a rigorous meaning
to their difference in the sense that, when first defined in finite
volume, it has a well-defined thermodynamic limit which coincides with
the right-hand side.

Actually (we again refer to [ 52 , 54 ] for more details) the
appropriate functional setting for the minimization of ( 1.1.5 ) is
highly non-trivial. This is because the response of the crystal to a
local charge defect is highly non-local. Due to the long range nature of
the Coulomb interaction, the charge density of @xmath has long range
oscillations and fails to be in @xmath as one might have naively hoped.
Then, defining an appropriate notion for the trace of @xmath is highly
not immediate. We follow [ 22 , 149 , 150 ] and split @xmath as

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (1.1.7)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

One can then define a generalized trace in the manner

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.1.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Of course, for a trace-class operator @xmath , the generalized trace
coincides with the usual notion, but this need not be the case in
general. We shall also make use of the fact that, because of the Pauli
principle ( 1.1.2 ), @xmath should satisfy the operator inequality

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.1.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which turns out to be equivalent to

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.1.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The natural interpretation of the kinetic energy term in ( 1.1.5 ) is
then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The coercivity property

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.1.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

allows to define a natural variational space ¹ ¹ 1 The reader should
bear in mind the rule of thumb @xmath .

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.1.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the @xmath -th Schatten class is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For all @xmath , there exists a charge density @xmath ) such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for all sufficiently regular @xmath , and one has @xmath . In this
setting, one can give a meaning to the expression

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.1.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

for the energy change of the crystal in the presence of the charge
defect @xmath . The minimal energy is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.1.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and it is shown in [ 52 ] that a minimizer exists. Some of its
properties are worked out in [ 54 ] .

### 1.2. A new polaron model, existence of bound states

Now we can define the polaron model introduced in [ 211 , 212 ] . The
idea is simply to set the charge defect @xmath in ( 1.1.13 ) equal to
the charge density of the (multi)-polaron, and add the energy of the
(multi)-polaron in vacuum. One should not forget to include the energy
due to the polaron feeling the electrostatic potential of the perfect
crystal.

Thus, for one polaron with wave-function @xmath , we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and for @xmath interacting polarons,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the multi-polaron’s many-body wave-function, with
associated charge density

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Since @xmath describes electrons, it should satisfy the Pauli exclusion
principle, i.e. be antisymmetric:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for all @xmath and all @xmath . Note that this assumption is not crucial
for the results of [ 211 , 212 ] . We could deal with the case where the
polarons are actually bosons, so that the wave-function is symmetric (no
minus sign in the right-hand side of ( 1.2.4 )).

In the above, the potential @xmath is that generated by the perfect
crystal in ( 1.1.4 ) and the energy @xmath is defined via ( 1.1.14 ). A
few comments are in order:

-   The main novelty of this model is that it makes no assumption on the
    ratio of the size of the (multi)-polaron to the crystal’s lattice
    spacing. It is thus appropriate for describing a “small polaron” as
    opposed to the more famous and widely used Fröhlich and Pekar
    models, that can only handle the case of a “large polaron”.

-   The Fröhlich and Pekar models are based on an effective description
    of the crystal’s excitations in terms of phonons. Our model can take
    into account the detailed structure of the host quantum crystal.

-   The price to pay for these advantages is the highly non-linear
    nature of the above functional. It is the source of very serious
    mathematical difficulties in the proofs.

-   We have neglected possible correlations between the polarons and the
    crystal. In that sense it does not cover some of the physics
    included in the Fröhlich model. However, the Pekar model can be
    derived from ours, as we shall discuss in Section 1.3 .

We now state the main results of [ 212 ] , referring to the original
paper for their proofs and to [ 298 ] for streamlined comments. We
denote

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.2.5)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.2.6)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

the minimal energies for a single polaron and a multi-polaron,
respectively. We have

###### Theorem 1.2.1 (Existence of small polarons [212]).

All minimizing sequences for @xmath converge to a minimizer, strongly in
@xmath , up to extraction and translation.

In other words, the model ( 1.2.1 ) does account for the binding of a
single polaron in an insulating quantum crystal: the attraction due to
the crystal’s deformation is sufficient to overcome the dispersive
nature of the quantum kinetic energy.

The case of a multi-polaron is more subtle since the attraction mediated
by the host crystal also has to overcome the usual Coulomb repulsion
between the additional electrons. The existence of a bound state depends
on the balance between the two forces, and we can give necessary and
sufficient conditions for binding to occur:

###### Theorem 1.2.2 (HVZ theorem for small multi-polarons [212]).

Let @xmath . The following assertions are equivalent:

1.   One has the binding inequality

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (1.2.7)
      -- -------- -- ---------

2.   All minimizing sequences for @xmath converge to a minimizer,
    strongly in @xmath , up to extraction and translation.

This is the natural generalization of the celebrated HVZ theorem [ 163 ,
342 , 362 ] to the non-linear setting of the multi-polaron. The binding
inequalities ( 1.2.7 ) express the fact that it is not favorable to
split the @xmath -polaron into two smaller objects, a @xmath -polaron
and a @xmath -polaron. It is easy to see that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

always holds, and the case of equality corresponds to dichotomy in the
concentration-compactness principle [ 243 , 244 , 245 ] . One can still
imagine that there are minimizers in this case, but then not all
minimizing sequences will converge, see [ 129 ] where such a case is
discussed. Note finally that checking the binding inequalities in
practice would be very difficult for our model. One can however use that
its macroscopic limit is given by the simplest Pekar functional, for
which some results on binding are known [ 146 , 130 , 131 , 201 ] .

As regards the proofs of the above results, they are based on a standard
concentration-compactness approach in the case of one polaron, and on
the natural generalization to non-linear quantum many-body systems
thereof [ 201 ] in the case of the multi-polaron. The main difficulty is
to rule out the dichotomy case in the concentration-compactness
principle. This is made highly non-trivial by the long range
oscillations in the response of the Fermi sea to a local charge defect.
It is not at all obvious that if the defect splits into two independent,
well-separated pieces, so does the perturbation of the Fermi sea.
Proving that this nevertheless happens, in a sufficiently strong sense,
is the key lemma of [ 212 ] .

### 1.3. Derivation of the Pekar functional

#### 1.3.1. Macroscopic limit

The Pekar model is appropriate for a “large polaron”, where large means
“compared to the host crystal’s lattice spacing”. To derive it from the
model we previously defined, we thus introduce a small parameter @xmath
to quantify the ratio between macroscopic and microscopic length scales:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath et @xmath defined as previously. The corresponding ground
state energy is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Similarly, for @xmath the energy functional of the @xmath -polaron is
defined as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with the one-body density @xmath given by ( 1.2.3 ). The associated
ground state energy is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.3.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Here we impose the scale separation by choosing a lattice whose unit
cell has a characteristic length of order @xmath . The weights of the
different terms of the functional are chosen in view of the scaling
properties of electrostatic energies, so that all terms contribute in
the limit @xmath .

A change of length and density units @xmath shows that, from the
(microscopic) point of view of the crystal (the macroscopic point of
view of the polaron being expressed in ( 1.3.1 )), the energy looks like

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.3.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Our choice of scaling is thus equivalent to having a fixed crystal and a
very light polaron, with mass @xmath (which justifies the choice of
notation).

In the rest of this section we explain how to recover the Pekar
functional in the limit @xmath . Note that this is very different from
the usual derivation starting from the Fröhlich model. In the latter
derivation [ 105 , 238 , 262 ] , the point is to understand why, in a
strong coupling limit, the polaron and phonons degrees of freedom
decorrelate. Here we have already neglected possible polaron/crystal
correlations in writing our small polaron model, and our task is to see
how, in a large polaron limit, one can reduce the description of the
crystal to its macroscopic dielectric properties.

#### 1.3.2. Anisotropic Pekar functional

The model we will obtain in the limit takes the dielectric matrix @xmath
of the crystal as a parameter. This is a scalar only in the case of a
cubic crystalline lattice, @xmath . Here is the Pekar functional
defining the limit problem:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.3.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is defined using Fourier variables

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.3.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Equivalently, one can define @xmath and @xmath by considering the
solution @xmath to the Poisson equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.3.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Then

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.3.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and the corresponding ground state energy is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.3.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Since a dielectric matrix always satisfies @xmath as an operator, it is
clear that the interaction @xmath is attractive.

For a @xmath -polaron we define similarly

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.3.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.3.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The case mostly considered in the literature [ 216 , 201 , 105 , 130 ,
131 , 146 ] has @xmath proportional to the identity matrix (isotropic
Pekar model), but see [ 290 ] for results on the anisotropic functional.

#### 1.3.3. The dielectric matrix of the crystal

Theres is an explicit formula for the dielectric matrix of a given
crystal [ 25 , 54 ] , but the most convenient definition in the present
context is through the approach of [ 54 ] . The matrix @xmath is
obtained by considering a macroscopic excitation of the Fermi sea: take
a charge defect of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with @xmath fixed, and insert this in the model discussed in Section 1.1
. We call @xmath an associated solution to ( 1.1.14 ) and @xmath the
corresponding electrostatic potential, rescaled back:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.3.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Cancès and Lewin proved in [ 54 , Theorem 3] that there exists a matrix
@xmath (that one can calculate given @xmath and @xmath ) such that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.3.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with @xmath the unique solution to Equation ( 1.3.8 ) where @xmath is
set equal to @xmath . This will serve as our definition of the
dielectric matrix: take a charge defect, smear it over a large length
scale while fixing the charge, compute the electrostatic response of the
Fermi, properly rescaled.

We first state a theorem giving the link between ( 1.1.14 ) and ( 1.3.7
), where the matrix @xmath entering the above quantity is defined as
above:

###### Theorem 1.3.1 (Macroscopic limit of the crystal’s energy [211]).

Let @xmath be a bounded sequence in @xmath , for some @xmath . Then

  -- -- -- ----------
           (1.3.15)
  -- -- -- ----------

This is the key ingredient in our approach. The assumption on the
sequence @xmath ensures local compactness to be able to pass to the
limit. Without such an assumption, the sequence might concentrate on too
small a scale for the energy to be given only in terms of macroscopic
dielectric properties (see [ 211 , Section 3.3] for an example).

#### 1.3.4. The anisotropic Pekar model as the macroscopic limit of the
small polaron

In order to discuss the main results in [ 211 ] , we note that the
potential @xmath appearing in ( 1.3.1 ) lives on the scale of the
crystal, much smaller than that of the polaron. One should thus expect
that the wave-function of the polaron will have fast oscillations to
accommodate this potential. Those are neglected in the Pekar functional,
but can be taken into account via a very simple eigenvalue problem: we
denote @xmath the unique positive solution to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the unit cell of the lattice @xmath and

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.3.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

gives the energy of particle of mass @xmath in the periodic potential
@xmath .

By periodicity one can extend @xmath to the whole of @xmath . A simple
perturbative argument shows that @xmath in @xmath when @xmath , and that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.3.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the unique @xmath -periodic solution to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This function shows up in a perturbative expansion of @xmath , see [ 211
, Section 2] :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (1.3.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

One can in fact rather easily get rid of the microscopic oscillations of
the polaron’s wave function by an energy decoupling. This leads to the
main result of this section:

###### Theorem 1.3.2 (Pekar’s functional as a macroscopic limit [211]).

We denote @xmath the dielectric matrix defined by ( 1.3.8 ) and ( 1.3.14
). Let @xmath be an integer.

-    (Convergence of the ground state energy) . We have

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (1.3.19)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    with @xmath given in ( 1.3.17 ), and @xmath the Pekar energy defined
    by ( 1.3.10 ) for @xmath and ( 1.3.12 ) for @xmath .

-    (Convergence of states) . Let @xmath be a sequence of approximate
    minimizers for @xmath , in the sense that

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    Define @xmath by setting

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (1.3.20)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    Then @xmath is a minimizing sequence for the Pekar energy @xmath .

    If either @xmath or @xmath and binding inequalities hold for the
    Pekar model, there exists a sequence of translations @xmath and a
    minimizer @xmath for @xmath such that

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (1.3.21)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    along a subsequence when @xmath .

Two concluding comments:

-   The result ( 1.3.20 ) shows the micro/macro scale separation. The
    polaron’s wave-function follows at the macroscopic scale a profile
    given by minimizing the Pekar functional, but also incorporates
    microscopic oscillations on the scale of the crystal, described by
    @xmath . We could just as well use the expansion ( 1.3.18 ) to
    replace @xmath . The fast oscillations would not appear in a result
    phrased in terms of a norm not involving derivatives. In view of (
    1.3.19 ) they however contribute to the energy at the same level as
    the Pekar energy and it is crucial to extract them to obtain
    convergence in @xmath .

-   Combining with a result of Lewin [ 201 , Theorem 28] , we see that
    for certain values of @xmath and @xmath , and in the macroscopic
    limit, minimizing sequences of our small polaron model do converge
    strongly, thus correctly accounting for the binging phenomenon, at
    least for large polarons.

## Chapter 2 Mean-field models of superfluids and superconductors

This chapter describes results on two related models: Ginzburg-Landau
theory for type II superconductors and Gross-Pitaevskii theory for
rotating superfluids. In both cases, the main question is the response
of a superfluid (or superconductor, which is often thought of as a
charged superfluid) to external gauge fields. This response is indeed
subtle and beautiful, and constitutes a hallmark of
superfluidity/superconductivity. In this memoir we describe works in two
directions:

-   on the appearance and theoretical description of vortex lattices in
    rotating trapped Bose gases, Section 2.1 .

-   on the surface superconductivity state of type II superconductors,
    Section 2.2 .

Previous contributions to the field by the author (in collaborations
with Xavier Blanc, Michele Correggi, Florian Pinsker and Jakob Yngvason)
can be found in [ 35 , 93 , 295 , 296 , 297 , 82 , 83 , 84 ] . They
shall not be discussed here, see rather [ 85 , 86 , 294 ] for overviews.

### 2.1. Inhomogeneous vortex lattices in rotating Bose-Einstein
condensates

One of the remarkable properties of Bose-Einstein condensates is their
superfluidity. It leads in particular to the nucleation of quantized
vortices, i.e. isolated zeros of the matter density surrounded by a
quantized phase circulation, in response to rotation. Among other
spectacular observations, that of triangular lattices ¹ ¹ 1 ‘Abrikosov
lattices’ of vortices analogous to those occurring in type-II
superconductors. containing up to hundreds of vortices (see, e.g., [ 254
, 46 , 1 , 74 , 283 ] ) gave a strong motivation for theoretical
studies.

The rigorous mathematical understanding of vortex patterns in
superfluids and superconductors has grown into a field of its own in the
past 20 years [ 3 , 34 , 311 ] . In particular, for a rotating trapped
Bose-Einstein condensate, several transitions characterized by the
number and arrangement of vortices have been rigorously investigated [ 3
, 4 , 10 , 166 , 165 , 88 , 87 , 82 , 84 , 296 , 297 ] . In this section
we discuss the results of [ 89 ] , where the onset of vortex lattices is
studied in a two-dimensional rotating condensate, starting from 2D
Gross-Pitaevskii theory.

The main finding is that, if the rotation frequency is larger than, but
of the same order of magnitude as, a certain critical value, a dense
pattern of vortices fills part of the condensate. One can derive an
explicit formula for the mean distribution of vortices, showing that in
this regime, the distribution is not uniform but responds to the
underlying inhomogeneous matter density. This contrasts with the
situation for larger angular velocities, where the vortex density is
uniform, although the matter density might vary in space.

#### 2.1.1. 2D Gross-Pitaevskii theory of the rotating Bose gas

The mathematical framework is as follows: we consider a two-dimensional
rotating BEC confined by a trapping potential. After a suitable scaling
of length units (see [ 84 , Section 1.1] ), the GP energy functional can
be written

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the angular velocity, the axis of rotation being
perpendicular to the plane of the condensate. For simplicity, we
consider a homogeneous trapping potential of the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In ( 2.1.1 ), @xmath stands for the vertical component of the angular
momentum. In polar coordinates @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

or equivalently

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The coupling parameter @xmath is going to be assumed small ( @xmath ),
i.e., we study the so called Thomas-Fermi (TF) limit of strong
interactions. The ground state energy of the system is obtained by the
minimization of @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We denote by @xmath any associated minimizer (there is no uniqueness in
the presence of vortices [ 316 , 88 , 84 ] ).

#### 2.1.2. Thomas-Fermi approximation for the density profile

In the regime we shall study, the vortex distribution in the condensate
will depend on the variations of the underlying matter density profile.
The latter, given by @xmath , can be approximated in the regime @xmath ,
by minimizing the simplified Thomas-Fermi (TF) functional

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

obtained by dropping the kinetic terms in ( 2.1.1 ). Here @xmath plays
the role of the matter density, normalized in @xmath . The minimizer of
( 2.1.4 ) is the explicit radial function

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath stands for the positive part and @xmath is a normalization
parameter that ensures

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Note that @xmath has compact support in a ball of radius @xmath and that
a rather simple computation yields

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath standing for the TF ground state energy. Essentially, @xmath
is the region occupied by the condensate: we are able to prove that that
@xmath decays exponentially (both as a function of @xmath and @xmath )
in @xmath .

#### 2.1.3. The cost function and the critical velocity

The mechanism for vortex nucleation in rotating superfluids is now
rather well understood [ 4 , 166 , 165 , 93 , 297 ] . One can encode in
a so-called cost function the energetic contribution of a vortex located
at a given point. We construct this function from two ingredients:

-   The energetic cost for vortex nucleation, given by

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (2.1.7)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    with @xmath the degree of the vortex and @xmath its location. This
    is the kinetic energy that is needed to generate the phase
    circulation around the vortex. The dependence on @xmath is due to
    the fact that the healing length of the condensate, which sets the
    vortex core radius, is equal to @xmath .

-   The energetic gain brought by the vortex locally compensating the
    rotation field. This, it turns out, we can express using a potential
    function

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (2.1.8)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    The energetic gain associated with a single vortex of degree @xmath
    located at @xmath is then

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (2.1.9)
      -- -------- -- ---------

The cost function we shall use to determine whether or not a vortex can
become energetically favorable at a given location is then

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Here we take into account the facts that vortices should have positive
degrees @xmath , because @xmath is clearly negative, and that several
vortices of degree @xmath are known to be more favorable than a single
vortex of larger degree.

Looking for the minimum of @xmath , one finds that it lies at @xmath ,
indicating that this is where a vortex is most favorable. Equating gain
and cost of a vortex at the origin, one can see that the critical speed
for vortex nucleation is given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

namely @xmath for @xmath and @xmath for @xmath . The above value is that
already found in [ 166 , 10 ] .

#### 2.1.4. The limit problem for the vorticity

The question we address here is what happens when @xmath is chosen of
the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

i.e., when @xmath is strictly larger than the first critical speed but
of the same order of magnitude when @xmath . In this regime many
vortices are nucleated in the condensate, and their mean distribution is
found by minimizing a certain energy functional that we now describe.

The energy of a given vorticity measure @xmath , i.e. a given mean
distribution of vortices is given in units of @xmath by the expression

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and the potential @xmath is determined through the elliptic PDE

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The last two terms of the functional give, as previously mentioned, the
balance of local energy cost and gain of individual vortices. The first
term accounts for the long-range, Coulomb-like, interaction between
vortices. Note indeed the analogy between this expression and classical
electrostatics: @xmath corresponds to a potential generated by @xmath in
a medium with inhomogeneous conductivity (encoded in the variations of
@xmath ).

The minimization of @xmath in its natural energy space

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

turns out to be explicit. We proved that @xmath has a unique minimizer
@xmath among the measures in @xmath . It is explicitly given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and we also get

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Note that ( 2.1.17 ) can be rewritten as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

a formula that had previously been obtained by formal means in [ 325 ,
326 ] . Our goal will be to derive it rigorously from the full GP
theory.

#### 2.1.5. Definition of the vorticity measure

It is convenient to be a little bit more precise in our way of
describing the variations of matter density. Corrections to the
Thomas-Fermi profile previously introduced can be taken into account
through the energy functional

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

i.e. the original GP functional ( 2.1.1 ) restricted to real functions.
It is a standard fact that the ground state energy

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

is achieved by a function @xmath which is unique up to sign. We take the
convention that @xmath and one can show that @xmath does not vanish.
This function corresponds to a vortex-free profile, taking into account
radial kinetic energy corrections to the TF minimizer due to the bending
of the matter density.

It is natural to write @xmath in the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is essentially a phase factor accounting for the vortices
of @xmath . A convenient way of spotting those is to use the so-called
vorticity measure

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which is (up to the @xmath factor) nothing but the curl of the
superfluid current

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and thus (in analogy with fluid mechanics) a good candidate to count the
vortices of @xmath . On can indeed show that, in the regime of our
interest, this “intrinsic” measure is very-well approximated by an
“explicit” measure counting the vortices of @xmath , weighted by their
degrees.

#### 2.1.6. Main theorem: the onset of vortex lattices

We may now state the main result of [ 89 ] . As usual [ 4 , 165 , 297 ]
, one cannot spot vortices lying too close to the boundary of the
domain. Indeed, @xmath vanishes on @xmath and thus, according to ( 2.1.7
), a vortex lying close to the boundary carries very little energy. We
will thus limit ourselves to analyzing the behavior of @xmath in the
smaller ball @xmath with @xmath satisfying

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The convergence of the vorticity measure will be quantified in the norm

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which turns our to be well-adapted to both the study of the limit
problem ( 2.1.13 ) and to the methods of proofs we use. The statement is
as follows:

###### Theorem 2.1.1 (Asymptotics for the vorticity measure).

Let @xmath and @xmath be defined respectively in ( 2.1.23 ) and ( 2.1.17
). Then we have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

in the limit @xmath .

In the course of the proof we establish the following energy estimate,
showing that the vortex energy gives the first correction to the density
profile energy in the limit @xmath :

###### Theorem 2.1.2 (Ground state energy asymptotics).

If @xmath , with @xmath , then

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.28)
  -- -------- -- ----------

in the limit @xmath .

To conclude, we discuss several properties of the (average) vortex
distribution that can be read off from ( 2.1.19 ).

-   When @xmath in ( 2.1.11 ), a straightforward computation reveals
    that the cost function @xmath is positive everywhere. Vortices are
    thus not favorable and the vortex distribution vanishes identically.
    We thus recover the expression of [ 166 , 10 ] for the first
    critical speed.

-   In the regime ( 2.1.12 ), one can compute that there is a non-empty
    region where @xmath and @xmath , whose size increases with
    increasing @xmath until it finally fills the whole sample in the
    limit @xmath . This region is, according to ( 2.1.19 ), filled with
    vortices, a behavior that is reminiscent of the ‘obstacle problem
    regime’ in Ginzburg-Landau theory [ 311 ] .

-   The first term in the right-hand side of ( 2.1.19 ) cannot be
    constant, except when @xmath is constant itself, which can only
    happen in the flat trap, where one formally sets @xmath . This term
    is thus responsible for an inhomogeneity of the vortex distribution,
    whereas the second term yields a constant contribution of @xmath (
    @xmath in the physical variables) units of vorticity per unit area.

-   The first term in ( 2.1.19 ), responsible for the inhomogeneity, is
    independent of @xmath . Its importance relative to the second one
    thus diminishes with increasing @xmath . The inhomogeneity then
    becomes a second order correction in the limit @xmath , which
    corresponds to @xmath . This is observed in experiments [ 74 ] and
    numerical simulations [ 97 ] and bridges with the situation
    considered in [ 84 ] , where we proved that, if @xmath , the vortex
    density is to leading order constant and proportional to @xmath .

### 2.2. The surface superconductivity regime in Ginzburg-Landau theory

The response of a superconducting material to an applied magnetic field
displays very rich physics. It is commonly [ 311 , 124 ] studied within
the effective mean-field/semi-classical Ginzburg-Landau theory. The
latter has been introduced on phenomenological grounds in [ 135 ] and
later derived [ 142 , 100 ] from the microscopic
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer [ 24 ] theory. The derivation has been made
mathematically rigorous only very recently [ 128 ] .

Here we describe the results of [ 90 , 91 , 92 ] on the surface
superconductivity state of type II superconductors. This is one of the
two main types of mixed phases occurring for large Ginzburg-Landau
parameter when a magnetic field is applied. Indeed, the phenomenology is
as follows:

-   For low applied magnetic field @xmath , the full sample is
    superconducting and the applied magnetic field is expelled (zero
    magnetic field in the sample). This is the so-called Meissner
    effect.

-   When the applied field reaches a first critical value @xmath ,
    vortices start to appear in the sample. These are small regions
    where the material is in its normal, non-superconducting, phase,
    surrounded by a sea of the superconducting phase. The vortices carry
    a phase circulation and organize in triangular lattices, see [ 157 ]
    for experiments. The situation in this regime is reminiscent of what
    has been discussed in Section 2.1 for trapped superfluids (see [ 311
    ] for review) but shall not concern us here.

-   At a second critical value @xmath of the applied field,
    superconductivity is lost uniformly in the bulk of the material, but
    survives close to the boundary. This is the surface
    superconductivity phenomenon we shall focus on, first predicted in [
    309 ] . Although clear experimental evidence has been reported
    pretty soon after the prediction [ 334 ] , it seems that direct
    experimental pictures of this phase became available only very
    recently [ 269 ] .

-   Finally, for applied fields larger than a third critical value
    @xmath , even surface superconductivity is destroyed by the magnetic
    field, and the full sample is in the normal phase.

Note that the above phenomenology stricto sensu applies only to samples
with smooth boundaries. If the boundary has corners, superconductivity
can survive in those for fields @xmath where @xmath is yet another,
distinct, critical value. We shall not discuss this case here: we
restrict to smooth boundaries, and thus there are only three critical
fields. We shall work in the regime @xmath . A review of the state of
the art on this regime, prior to our papers [ 90 , 91 , 92 ] , can be
found in the monograph [ 124 ] .

#### 2.2.1. 2D Ginzburg-Landau theory

We consider an infinitely long superconducting cylinder of cross-section
@xmath . Throughout, we assume that @xmath is compact and simply
connected, with smooth boundary. The state of a superconductor is
described by an order parameter @xmath and an induced magnetic vector
potential @xmath generating an induced magnetic field

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which is different from the applied field.

We write the Ginzburg-Landau energy functional in units convenient for
the discussion of surface superconductivity (other conventions are
commonly used [ 311 , 124 ] ):

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Here we use the standard covariant derivative

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

@xmath and @xmath are positive parameters depending on the material and
the applied field, that we assume to be constant. Units have been chosen
in such a way that @xmath measures the intensity of the external
magnetic field. We shall study the asymptotic regime @xmath , for values
of @xmath satisfying

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a spectral parameter (minimum ground state energy of the
shifted harmonic oscillator on the half-line):

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The case @xmath (respectively @xmath ) corresponds to the second
critical field (respectively the third critical field).

The above functional is invariant under the change of gauge

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, the only physically relevant quantities are the gauge invariant
ones such as the density @xmath , which provides the local relative
density of superconducting electrons (bound in Cooper pairs). Any
minimizing @xmath must satisfy @xmath . A value @xmath (respectively,
@xmath ) corresponds to the superconducting (respectively, normal) phase
where all (respectively, none) of the electrons form Cooper pairs. We
are interested in the ground state problem

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and denote @xmath any minimizing pair.

#### 2.2.2. Effective functionals

In the surface superconductivity regime ( 2.2.2 ), the order parameter
@xmath is concentrated on a length scale of order @xmath close to the
boundary of the sample. In addition, the applied magnetic field
essentially penetrates the sample, so that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Justifying these expectations mathematically is a hard task [ 124 ] .
Accepting them, one is lead to natural reduced models describing the
physics in the boundary layer. We use scaled boundary coordinates @xmath
and @xmath (tangential and normal coordinates, in units of @xmath ).
Performing a suitable choice of gauge, one may obtain:

-   A functional corresponding to the case of a half-plane sample

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (2.2.4)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    Here one approximates the physical boundary by a straight line using
    the fact that all the physics happens at distance @xmath of the
    boundary and neglecting lower order corrections in @xmath .

-   A 1D functional obtained by inserting an ansatz @xmath in the above:

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (2.2.5)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    It is certainly not obvious, but nevertheless true and part of our
    results, that such an ansatz is optimal for computing the energy in
    the regime ( 2.2.2 ).

-   The above functionals neglect the boundary’s curvature altogether.
    One can, and must, go beyond this approximation for the next
    results. This is done by introducing a refined 1D functional

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (2.2.6)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    where @xmath plays the role of a local curvature and @xmath is an
    (essentially) arbitrary constant. This is the natural refinement
    of ( 2.2.5 ) one should introduce in the case of a disk sample of
    radius @xmath One can then use it to locally approximate the
    physical sample’s boundary by the auscultating circle rather than by
    the tangent.

#### 2.2.3. Energy and density asymptotics

The link between the full Ginzburg-Landau energy and the above reduced
functionals is given by the next theorem. Minimizing ( 2.2.6 ) with
respect to both the function @xmath and the real number @xmath we obtain
an optimal energy @xmath , an optimal profile @xmath and an optimal
phase @xmath . The rationale is that essentially

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

up to a suitable gauge choice, i.e. that for a fixed tangential
coordinate @xmath , @xmath is well-approximated by minimizing the
reduced energy ( 2.2.6 ).

###### Theorem 2.2.1 (Surface superconductivity: energy and density
asymptotics).

Denote @xmath the curvature of the boundary @xmath . For any fixed
@xmath , in the limit @xmath , we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for some power @xmath .

Note that the error terms in the estimates are much smaller than the
subleading order of the main terms, as one can easily realize. The above
generalizes and complements previous results of [ 274 , 13 , 125 ] in
two directions:

-   The theorem is valid for the full surface superconductivity regime (
    2.2.2 ). The only previous result holding in this generality is that
    of [ 274 ] where an energy estimate in terms of ( 2.2.4 ) is
    obtained. The reduction to a 1D functional was performed in [ 13 ,
    125 ] but only for @xmath . This was accomplished by perturbative
    methods: the limiting regime @xmath being essentially linear, one
    can use several spectral theory tools there and try to push the
    regime of applicability as far as one can. It turns out that this
    approach does not cover the full physical regime ( 2.2.2 ) and
    indeed, we use a completely different method for the 1D reduction.

-   The estimates above contain information at subleading order: the
    minimization of ( 2.2.5 ) gives the leading order of Problem ( 2.2.6
    ) and previous results were all limited to that level of precision.
    In this theorem, one actually computes the energetic contribution of
    the domain’s curvature, something that had so far remained elusive
    in the regime ( 2.2.2 ). This bridges with previous results [ 124 ]
    in the regime @xmath where the role of curvature is much better
    understood.

#### 2.2.4. Absence of vortices and estimate of the phase circulation

The above theorem only gives averaged (in the @xmath sense) information
about the Ginzburg-Landau minimizer. In particular, in the absence of
uniform estimates, it does not rule out the possibility that the surface
superconductivity layer might contain normal inclusions, e.g. vortices.
This seems rather unnatural from a physical point of view, but had never
been ruled out in a mathematically rigorous manner. We can deduce from
the refined energy estimates of Theorem 2.2.1 a @xmath estimate in the
boundary layer

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath stands for “boundary layer” and @xmath is any quantity such
that ² ² 2 @xmath is a suitably large constant.

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

###### Theorem 2.2.2 (Uniform density estimates and Pan’s conjecture).

Under the assumptions of the previous theorem, it holds

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

for some constant @xmath . In particular for any @xmath we have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath does not depend on @xmath .

Estimate ( 2.2.12 ) solves the original form of a conjecture by Xing-Bin
Pan [ 274 , Conjecture 1] . In addition, since @xmath is strictly
positive, the stronger estimate ( 2.2.11 ) ensures that @xmath does not
vanish in the boundary layer ( 2.2.9 ). A physical consequence of the
theorem is thus that normal inclusions such as vortices may not occur in
the surface superconductivity phase.

Since @xmath cannot vanish on @xmath , its phase is well-defined there,
and one could try to estimate it. Of course, only gauge invariant
quantities make sense physically. One such quantity is the winding
number (a.k.a. phase circulation or topological degree) of @xmath around
the boundary @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

@xmath standing for the tangential derivative. Theorem 2.2.2 ensures
that @xmath is well-defined. Roughly, this quantity measures the number
of quantized phase singularities (vortices) that @xmath has inside
@xmath . Our estimate is as follows:

###### Theorem 2.2.3 (Winding number of @xmath on the boundary).

Under the previous assumptions, any GL minimizer @xmath satisfies

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

in the limit @xmath .

Note that the last two theorems only capture the leading 1D contribution
of ( 2.2.5 ), and do not show curvature corrections. Their proofs
however require the full precision of the energy estimate ( 2.2.7 ).
Indeed, one can easily see that the energetic cost of a normal inclusion
would scale as @xmath . It is thus necessary to expand the energy at
least to that order if one is to rule this possibility out.

#### 2.2.5. Influence of boundary curvature

As already mentioned, one of the main novelties of Theorem 2.2.1 is that
it exhibits energetic contributions due to the sample’s curvature. It is
desirable to obtain more precise results, expliciting the distribution
of superconducting electrons along the boundary, as a function of
curvature. For obvious physical reasons, it would be desirable to have
estimates of the density @xmath . This we cannot do with the desired
precision, but we can obtain a rather explicit estimate of @xmath :

###### Theorem 2.2.4 (Curvature dependence of the order parameter).

Let @xmath be a Ginzburg-Landau minimizer and @xmath a measurable set
whose boundary @xmath intersects @xmath with @xmath angles. Denote
@xmath the curvature of @xmath as a (smooth) function of the tangential
coordinate @xmath .

For any @xmath , in the limit @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath stands for the 1D Lebesgue measure along @xmath and

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.2.16)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.2.17)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

Moreover, for @xmath small enough (independently of @xmath ), @xmath

The leading order term in ( 2.2.15 ) had previously been computed [ 126
, 169 , 274 ] , with a less explicit expression of the constant @xmath
however. The above theorem shows that the concentration of
superconducting electrons along the boundary depends linearly on the
curvature. Close to the third critical field, we are able to show that
curvature, counted inwards, favors surface superconductivity. This is in
accord with previous results (see again [ 124 ] for review) obtained in
the perturbative regime @xmath , in particular with known corrections to
the expression of the third critical field. Note that the assumption
that the set @xmath intersects @xmath at right angles is probably
necessary to state the result in the form above: integration along lines
of constant tangential coordinate and delicate estimates of tangential
variations of the order parameter are involved in the proof.

Let us explain briefly how one obtains the above expressions. The
variations due to the boundary’s geometry are encoded in the behavior of
the 1D functional ( 2.2.6 ). Since we work in the regime @xmath , it is
natural to consider a perturbative expansion of @xmath . We then get
that the leading order is given by the @xmath functional ( 2.2.5 ) and
that the first correction is @xmath times

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which is obtained by retaining only linear terms in @xmath when
expanding ( 2.2.6 ). It turns out that this correction, evaluated at
@xmath , is equal to @xmath defined above. Then, if one can localize in
the set @xmath the energy estimate ( 2.2.7 ), a version of ( 2.2.15 )
with @xmath replaced by the Ginzburg-Landau energy density results.
Integrating the Ginzburg-Landau variational equation over @xmath and
estimating a boundary term (a delicate step) leads to the result for the
distribution of @xmath .

## Chapter 3 Rigorous studies of fractional quantum Hall states

The Hall effect has been discovered in the 19th century: if an electric
current is imposed on a 2D sample in the presence of a perpendicular
magnetic field, a voltage drop perpendicular to both the current and the
magnetic field develops, due to the Lorentz force acting on charge
carriers. This effect is in fact a popular way to measure the carriers’
density and charge in a sample. The more recent discovery of the quantum
Hall effects (integer, and then fractional) has lead to two Nobel prizes
in physics (von Klitzing in 1985, Laughlin-Störmer-Tsui in 1998). The
conductance associated to the perpendicular voltage drop is in fact
quantized in certain fractions ¹ ¹ 1 With @xmath and @xmath the charge
of the electron and Planck’s constant, respectively. of @xmath . The
precision of the quantization is astonishing, independently of the
sample’s details. So much so that it is nowadays used to set the
resistivity standard.

The integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) can be understood within
non-interacting electron models. While a full theoretical understanding
is lengthy and difficult (see e.g. [ 26 , 139 ] for reviews), the basic
ingredients are the well-known Landau quantization of kinetic energy
levels in presence of a magnetic field, and the Pauli principle. The
fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) on the other hand has been
recognized very early as being due to the occurrence of new, strongly
correlated, electronic ground states (see [ 137 , 139 , 333 , 189 , 167
] for reviews). The theoretical understanding of these new states of
matter is still one of the most challenging problems of condensed matter
physics. Very little is known at a full mathematical level of rigor. In
this chapter we describe some results aiming at filling part of this
gap. We focus on studies of the most basic fractional quantum Hall
states, introduced by Laughlin in 1983.

As happened with many condensed matter phenomena, it has been suggested
[ 36 , 345 , 77 ] that insight on the FQHE could be gained by emulating
(part of) the physics in a cold atoms system. This has so far remained
elusive (see however [ 242 , 190 ] for recent experimental progress),
but this promising possibility opens new theoretical questions. These
regard both the proposed specific cold atoms realizations of FQHE
physics, and basic properties of FQHE states that could be probed more
easily in those than in actual 2D electron gases.

Section 3.1 below is a short general introduction to the topics
addressed in this chapter. In Section 3.2 we discuss FQHE states in
rotating trapped Bose gases, with a special emphasis on how the trap
should be taken into account. This issue, and related ones in the 2D
electron gas setting, leads to the introduction of a new variational
problem and related asymptotic estimates that we study in Section 3.3 .
We refer to these inequalities as “incompressibility estimates” because
they shed light on the rigidity that the Laughlin state displays in its
response to external potentials, a crucial property in FQHE physics. A
(very) streamlined review of this material has already appeared in [ 302
] .

### 3.1. General framework

The situation of interest for this chapter is that of interacting
particles confined in two space dimensions, submitted to a perpendicular
magnetic field of constant strength. The Hamiltonian of the full system
is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the vector potential of the applied magnetic field of
strength @xmath , given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

in the symmetric gauge. The pair interaction potential is denoted @xmath
, the coupling constant @xmath . Here we think of repulsive
interactions,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Units are chosen so that Planck’s constant @xmath , the velocity of
light and the charge are equal to 1, and the mass is equal to 1/2. The
potential @xmath can model both trapping of the particles and disorder
in the sample. We will study systems made of fermions or bosons, so
@xmath will act either on @xmath or @xmath , the anti-symmetric or
symmetric @xmath -fold tensor products of @xmath .

The quantum Hall effect (integer or fractional) occurs in the regime of
very large applied magnetic fields, @xmath . We shall thus here restrict
attention to single particle states corresponding to the lowest
eigenvalue of @xmath , i.e., the lowest Landau level (LLL)

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

as the single-particle Hilbert space. Here and in the sequel we identify
vectors @xmath and complex numbers @xmath . We choose units so that the
magnetic field is @xmath , in order to comply with the conventions for
rotating Bose gases as in [ 304 , 305 ] where @xmath corresponds to
@xmath times the angular velocity.

The best understood situation leading to a FQHE is that where the
interactions are repulsive enough to force the many-body wave-function
to vanish whenever particles come close together. Laughlin [ 187 ]
suggested the very fruitful idea that the ground state of a 2D electron
gas could be described, in such a parameter regime, by many-body
wave-functions of the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Here @xmath is an odd integer and @xmath the coordinates of the 2D
electrons, identified with complex numbers, and measured in units of the
magnetic length. The constant @xmath normalizes the state in @xmath .
One can trivially adapt the wave-function to the bosonic case by taking
@xmath even, @xmath being the most relevant case. Much of FQHE physics
is based on the strong inter-particle correlations included in
Laughlin’s wave-function.

The proposed trial state ( 3.1.3 ) satisfies three requirements:

-   it is built solely out of one-particle orbitals of the lowest Landau
    level, and thus minimizes the magnetic kinetic energy;

-   it vanishes when two electrons collide, at a faster rate than that
    imposed by the Pauli principle (which corresponds to @xmath );

-   one can argue that it corresponds to a filling factor @xmath (number
    of electrons per unit magnetic area) of approximately @xmath .

It historically served as the basis of a theory explaining the FQHE at
@xmath , the first case where it was observed. It also allowed to
predict the effect at @xmath , observed later. Noteworthily, this
wave-function is proposed as a ground state ansatz for the Hamiltonian (
3.1.1 ) with @xmath . The rationale is that the FQHE happens when the
energy scales are, by order of importance ² ² 2 Actually, one assumes
first that the electrons’ spins are all aligned with the magnetic field,
but this is already implicit in ( 3.1.1 ). , first the magnetic kinetic
energy, then the repulsive interactions and last the potential energy
due to trapping and disorder.

More generally, one may restrict the wave function to live in the space

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is the @xmath -body bosonic Bargmann space (symmetric here means
invariant under exchange of two particles @xmath , @xmath ), with scalar
product

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In allowing this more general class of states we want to have some
flexibility to accommodate the external potential @xmath in ( 3.1.1 ).
We still assume that the main energy scales are set by the magnetic
kinetic energy and the repulsive interactions, but this leaves some
freedom, which is important in applications:

-   In the 2D electron gas where the FQHE is observed, the disorder
    potential due to impurities is absolutely crucial to explain the
    effect. Indeed, a large part of Laughlin’s theory concerns the
    response of his proposed ground state to disorder.

-   In experiments with cold Bose gases, a trapping potential is
    ubiquitous, and it is of importance to understand how the Laughlin
    state responds to it. Actually, some recent proposals [ 263 , 291 ,
    276 ] to emulate FQHE physics with cold atoms require some
    non-trivial engineering of the trap.

It is of some importance in Laughlin’s theory that the system actually
chooses simple functions such as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for some one-particle analytic function @xmath , rather than having a
genuine general @xmath in ( 3.1.4 ). Comparisons with experiments are
pretty convincing, but the profound reason for the emergence of such
forms is not quite obvious. A large part of the works presented here is
motivated by this issue.

### 3.2. The fractional quantum Hall regime in rotating trapped Bose
gases

The formal similarity between the Hamiltonian of a rotating Bose gas and
that of a 2D electron gas in a magnetic field suggests the possibility
of studying bosonic analogues of the FQHE in cold quantum gases set in
rapid rotation. In particular, a phase transition from a Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) with a vortex lattice (studied e.g. in [ 7 , 5 , 9 , 8
] ) to a strongly correlated Laughlin state should happen [ 33 , 79 , 80
] at total angular momentum @xmath (filling factor of order @xmath ),
where @xmath denotes the particle number. This phase transition has not
been observed yet because it is extremely difficult to reach such high
angular momenta in the laboratory.

The reasons for this difficulty can be understood as follows. The usual
experimental setup consists of bosonic atoms in a rotating trap modeled
by a harmonic potential. The usual approximations for large rotation
frequency are that the gas is essentially 2D, that single-particle
orbitals are confined to the lowest Landau level and that the
inter-particles interactions are described by a Dirac delta potential.
These can to some extent be backed with rigorous mathematics [ 213 ] .
Accepting them, the relevant Hamiltonian boils down to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

operating on wave functions @xmath , @xmath , in the lowest Landau level
(LLL) of a two-dimensional magnetic Hamiltonian. Here @xmath is half the
difference between the squares of the frequency of the harmonic trap and
of the rotation velocity, measured in units of the latter, and @xmath is
the coupling constant of the interaction. When @xmath is large, one can
prove [ 232 ] that the ground state of @xmath shows Bose-Einstein
condensation, i.e. correlations between particles almost vanish. To
obtain correlated states, one wants to favor the interaction, i.e.,
consider small values of @xmath . Clearly this corresponds to a singular
limit where the gas is no longer confined against centrifugal forces.
This is the main source of difficulty that has to be overcome to create
the Bose-Laughlin state (see [ 291 ] for a more quantitative
discussion).

A natural proposal [ 46 , 345 , 263 ] is to add a confining term that
should be stronger than quadratic (i.e., stronger than the centrifugal
force). Here we investigate asymptotic properties of ground states after
such an addition to the Hamiltonian. We focus in a regime where the
parameters are tuned to favor strong correlations. A simple model for
the additional term is @xmath with @xmath , that has already been
considered in the context of rotating BECs [ 4 , 46 , 35 , 83 , 84 , 295
] . A new problem that has to be tackled is the lack of commutativity of
the anharmonic potential term, projected onto the lowest Landau level,
and the interaction. This implies that the Laughlin state is not an
exact eigenstate of the modified Hamiltonian as it is for the
Hamiltonian in a purely harmonic trap. In this section we summarize the
papers [ 304 , 305 ] where we studied this situation from a mathematical
point of view.

#### 3.2.1. Model for the quantum Hall regime

Taking for granted the approximations mentioned previously, we shall
consider a model with one-particle states reduced to the lowest Landau
level ( 3.1.2 ). For a rotating Bose gas, the role of the magnetic field
@xmath is played by twice the rotation frequency. Setting the latter
equal to @xmath for simplicity, the @xmath -particle Hilbert space is
thus

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the Bargmann space for @xmath bosons is defined as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This is a Hilbert space with scalar product inherited from the usual
@xmath product:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We are interested in an energy functional corresponding to ( 3.2.1 ),
with an additional quartic term in the one-body potential:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is the one-body density of @xmath , normalized to @xmath , and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The second term in ( 3.2.5 ) corresponds to contact interactions, where
only the value of the wave-function along the diagonals of configuration
space is penalized. For a general wave-function @xmath this is of course
ill-defined, but we are interested in minimizing amongst the extremely
regular functions of the @xmath -particles LLL ( 3.2.2 ):

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Then, the energy functional ( 3.2.5 ) is perfectly well-defined, and one
can show that it is in fact the quadratic form associated with a certain
bounded operator on the Bargmann space ( 3.2.3 ):

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

the angular momentum operator in the @xmath -th variable and

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We state the correspondence between ( 3.2.5 ) and ( 3.2.9 ) as a lemma,
whose proof is a combination of well-known arguments (see [ 6 , 275 ,
305 ] ):

###### Lemma 3.2.1 (Hamiltonian in the Bargmann space).

We have, for any @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In particular

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Moreover, @xmath is an eigenvalue of @xmath with (possibly non unique)
eigenfunction @xmath . One may choose @xmath to have a definite total
angular momentum, say

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Equivalently, the infimum in ( 3.2.8 ) is attained. One may choose a
minimizer @xmath with definite angular momentum @xmath .

In the sequel we are interested in properties of a ground state with
fixed angular momentum, in the regime where correlations between
particles are so strong that the wave-function essentially belongs to a
space of the form ( 3.1.4 ), and thus contains (at least) the
correlations built-in in the Laughlin state.

#### 3.2.2. Criteria for strong correlations in the ground state

It is easy to see that the space ( 3.1.4 ), for @xmath , corresponds to
the null space of the total interaction operator

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

i.e. for @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We first state criteria ensuring that the ground state of our problem
almost fully lives in @xmath . These are stated in terms of the gaps of
the so-called yrast curve ³ ³ 3 Note that the total angular momentum
commutes with the total interaction.

  -- -- -- ----------
           (3.2.15)
  -- -- -- ----------

whose dependence on the total particle number @xmath and angular
momentum @xmath is unfortunately unknown at present.

###### Theorem 3.2.2 (Criteria for strong correlations in the ground
state).

Let @xmath be a minimizer of ( 3.2.8 ) and @xmath the projector on the
orthogonal complement of @xmath . Define the spectral gaps

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

in the limit @xmath , @xmath if one of the following conditions holds :

Case 1. @xmath and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Case 2. @xmath and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Case 3. @xmath and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Case 4. @xmath and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We believe that these criteria for entering the strongly correlated
Laughlin phase @xmath are essentially optimal. They set bounds on
parameters of a putative experiment needed to obtain the new physics
(beyond that of Bose-Einstein condensates) of the FQHE regime.

Note that obtaining such a theorem in the case @xmath is essentially
trivial since in that case the Hamiltonian is made of two parts, one
proportional to the total angular momentum and the other to the total
interaction. These commute with one another (because of rotational
invariance of the full interaction) and may thus be jointly
diagonalized, so that the ground state must lie on the yrast line, i.e.
achieve the infimum in ( 3.2.15 ) for some @xmath . The difficulties in
the proof of Theorem 3.2.2 thus reside in the quartic addition to the
trapping potential, which destroys the nice structure of the @xmath
case.

Of course, one would be interested in gaining more knowledge on the
@xmath -dependence of the gaps ( 3.2.16 ) setting the conditions for
strong correlations. In view of existing numerical results [ 286 , 287 ,
288 , 346 ] , a natural conjecture seems to be that

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.2.19)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.2.20)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

so that one could replace @xmath by universal constants in the
statement, but this remains an open problem. The different cases in the
theorem correspond to changes in the nature of the ground state, as we
discuss next.

#### 3.2.3. Angular momentum estimates

We have just introduced criteria for entering the strongly correlated
regime. In the purely harmonic case @xmath , one can easily show that as
soon as the ground state essentially lives on @xmath , then it is
essentially proportional to the Laughlin state ( 3.1.3 ). This is
because the Laughlin state clearly has the smallest angular momentum
amongst functions canceling the interaction operator. When @xmath and
@xmath , the one-body potential develops a local maximum at the origin,
which results in new physics: a state of @xmath with larger angular
momentum can be preferred over the Laughlin state.

###### Theorem 3.2.3 (Angular momentum estimates).

In the limit @xmath , @xmath the angular momentum @xmath of a ground
state of @xmath satisfies

1.   If @xmath ,

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (3.2.21)
      -- -------- -- ----------

2.   If @xmath and @xmath ,

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (3.2.22)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    where

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (3.2.23)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    In particular @xmath if @xmath .

3.   If @xmath and @xmath

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (3.2.24)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    In particular @xmath if @xmath .

The first estimate is compatible with the Laughlin state staying an
(approximate) ground state, and we indeed believe this is the case. On
the contrary, in the other two cases, the theorem shows that the ground
state has a strictly larger angular momentum (for @xmath , the Laughlin
state has angular momentum @xmath ). There should be a phase transition
associated with the passage from a strictly increasing trap when @xmath
to a mexican-hat potential when @xmath . We are not able at present to
characterize more precisely the ground states. A possible track to do so
is discussed in Section 3.3 . Before proceeding to this, we illustrate
the expected behavior by considering trial states.

#### 3.2.4. Behavior of trial states

The proof of the above results relies heavily on the construction and
analysis of suitable trial states. We believe , but cannot prove at
present, that those are essentially optimal in the regime of parameters
discussed in Theorem 3.2.2 . The structural changes in these trial
functions provides the rationale for the occurrence of different
regimes, and in particular for the changes in the total angular momentum
of the ground state obtained in Theorem 3.2.3 .

As noticed above, the one-body potential of our problem changes from
having a local minimum at the origin to having a local maximum when
@xmath is decreased. We need to have some flexibility in the matter
density of our trial states to adapt to this behavior, which leads us to
the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

were @xmath is a normalization constant. One recovers the pure Laughlin
state for @xmath and the states with @xmath are usually referred to as
Laughlin quasi-holes (whence the label @xmath ). The factor @xmath is
interpreted as a multiply quantized vortex located at the origin. Its
role is to deplete the density of the state when @xmath to reduce
potential energy. We shall be lead to taking @xmath rather large, and
will thus also refer to the above functions as “Laughlin + giant vortex”
states.

Our task is to calculate the potential energy

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

of our trial states, with @xmath as in ( 3.2.6 ). Given a candidate
trial state we thus want to evaluate precisely what the corresponding
matter density is. It is convenient to work with scaled variables,
defining (we do not emphasize the dependence on @xmath )

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We compare the one-body density corresponding to ( 3.2.27 ), i.e.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with the minimizer @xmath of the mean-field free energy functional

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.28)
  -- -------- -- ----------

amongst probability measures on @xmath . Here

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the notation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

stands for the 2D Coulomb energy. Our results on the trial states’
density profiles may be summarized as follows:

###### Theorem 3.2.4 (Density estimates for Laughlin + giant vortex
trial states).

There exists a constant @xmath such that for large enough @xmath and any
smooth function @xmath on @xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.30)
  -- -------- -- ----------

if @xmath , and

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.31)
  -- -------- -- ----------

if @xmath .

Our main tool is the well-known plasma analogy, originating in [ 187 ,
188 ] , wherein the density of the Laughlin state is interpreted as the
Gibbs measure of a classical 2D Coulomb gas (one component plasma). More
precisely, after the scaling of space variables, one can identify the
@xmath -particle density of the Laughlin state with the Gibbs measure of
a 2D jellium with mean-field scaling, that is a system of @xmath
particles in the plane interacting via weak (with a prefactor @xmath )
logarithmic pair-potentials and with a constant neutralizing background.
Within this analogy the vortex of degree @xmath in ( 3.2.25 ) is
interpreted as an additional point charge pinned at the origin.

Existing knowledge about the mean-field limit for classical particles
then suggests the approximation made rigorous in the above theorem. For
our purpose, precise estimates that were not available in the literature
are required, so we developed a new strategy for the study of the mean
field limit that gives explicit and quantitative estimates on the
fluctuations around the mean field density that are of independent
interest.

This result allows to evaluate the one-particle density of our trial
states in a simple and explicit way and deduce estimates of the
potential energy ( 3.2.26 ). Optimizing these over @xmath , we find

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.2.32)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We interpret this as a strong indication that, within the fully
correlated regime, a transition occurs for @xmath and @xmath between a
pure Laughlin state and a correlated state with a density depletion at
the origin. Interestingly we also find that the character of the
mean-field density @xmath and thus that of the one-particle density of
the state ( 3.2.25 ) strongly depends on @xmath : For @xmath it is
correctly approximated by a flat density profile located in a disc or an
annulus (depending on the value of @xmath ), whereas for @xmath the
density profile is approximately a radial Gaussian centered on some
circle. This is due to a transition from a dominantly electrostatic to a
dominantly thermal behavior of the 2D Coulomb gas to which we compare
our trial states. Using the expression of the optimal value of @xmath
given in ( 3.2.32 ) this suggests a further transition in the ground
state of ( 3.2.8 ) in the regime @xmath . Establishing these phenomena
rigorously remains a challenging open problem, but they provide a
rationale for the estimates on the true ground states that we stated
previously.

### 3.3. Incompressibility estimates for the Laughlin phase

In the previous section we were interested in a cold-atoms physics
situation where ground states should be of the form ( 3.1.4 ), and we
were looking for a factor @xmath (or more simply, a @xmath in ( 3.1.7 ))
that would optimize the potential energy in a trapping potential. As
discussed earlier this kind of situation also occurs in FQHE physics
proper (i.e. in 2D electron gases) where the one-body potential accounts
for trapping, but also, more importantly, for disorder. The recurrence
of this kind of problem has lead us to consider in the papers [ 306 ,
307 ] a general framework for studying such questions. We summarize this
work in this section. In short, the programme is:

1.  Assume, as is often done in FQHE physics, that the interaction is
    strong enough to force the ground state to live in ( 3.1.4 ) for
    some @xmath .

2.  Assume further, in first approximation, that choosing such a form
    renders the interaction energy negligible.

3.  Consider then minimizing the remaining part of the energy, namely
    that due to the one-body potential, within the class ( 3.1.4 ).

4.  What can be said in general of the minimization problem, of the
    ground state energy ?

5.  What general features do the one-body densities of states of the
    form ( 3.1.4 ) have in common ?

6.  In particular, can one argue rigorously for some form of
    incompressibility, as expected from physical arguments ?

7.  Can one show that, in this simplified context, minimizers always
    (approximately) take the form ( 3.1.7 ) ?

The physical motivation comes from Items 6 and 7. Incompressibility is
expected to be an essential feature of FQHE states, and trial states of
the form ( 3.1.7 ) play a very prominent role in the theory. Note that
the trial states ( 3.2.25 ) we have discussed previously are of this
form. The above programme, if completed, would confirm that they are
energetically optimal, as we discuss further below.

#### 3.3.1. A new variational problem

The programme sketched above leads us to the study of a very simple
energy functional. Given a one-body potential @xmath we consider the
energy of a state @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

depending only on the 1-particle probability density @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We will be interested in studying the ground state problem of
minimizing ( 3.3.1 ), within the Laughlin phase @xmath . We take for
granted the reduction to the LLL and cancellation of the interactions by
the vanishing of the wave function along the diagonals of configuration
space. We wish to see whether the Laughlin state, or a close variant,
emerges as the natural ground state in a given potential. In particular
we investigate the robustness of the correlations of Laughlin’s wave
function when the trapping potential is varied.

In view of ( 3.1.4 ) we are looking for a wave-function of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath and @xmath is a normalization factor. A natural guess is
that, whatever the one-body potential, the correlations stay in the same
form and the ground state is well-approximated by a wave function

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the additional holomorphic factor @xmath that characterizes
functions of @xmath is uncorrelated. Indeed, the energy functional
dictating the form of @xmath contains only one-body terms once the
form ( 3.1.4 ) is assumed. It thus does not seem favorable to correlate
the state more than necessary. Although intuitively appealing, this
reasoning is too simplistic, and the emergence of the ansatz ( 3.3.3 )
is far from trivial. This is because ( 3.3.1 ) is a one-body functional
in terms of @xmath , but the correlation factor @xmath itself really
sees an effective, complicated, many-body Hamiltonian. This is due to
the factor @xmath it is combined with to form the state @xmath .

#### 3.3.2. Incompressibility of the Laughlin phase

The energy functional ( 3.3.1 ) is of course very simple and all the
difficulty of the problem lies in the intricate structure of the
variational set ( 3.1.4 ). The expected rigidity of the strongly
correlated states of ( 3.1.4 ) should manifest itself through the
property that their densities are essentially bounded above by a
universal constant

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This is the incompressibility notion we will investigate, in the limit
@xmath . In view of existing numerical computations of the Laughlin
state [ 72 ] , Estimate ( 3.3.4 ) can hold only in some appropriate weak
sense. We now discuss the approach we follow, formulated in terms of the
previous variational problem.

It is a well-known fact [ 187 ] (a rigorous justification follows from
Theorem 3.2.4 above) that the one-particle density of the Laughlin state
is approximately constant over a disc of radius @xmath and then quickly
drops to @xmath . It is thus natural to also consider external
potentials that live on this scale, which amounts to scale space
variables ⁴ ⁴ 4 That we scale lengths by a factor @xmath instead of
@xmath is of course irrelevant for large @xmath . It only serves to
simplify some expressions. and consider rather the energy functional

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is of the form ( 3.1.4 ) and @xmath is the corresponding
matter density. We shall be concerned with the large @xmath behavior of
the ground state energy

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

By scaling, the bound

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

follows from the conjectured estimate ( 3.3.4 ). We thus expect the
bath-tub energy [ 219 , Theorem 1.14]

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

to play a role in this context. We recast ( 3.3.4 ) in a “weak dual
formulation” by conjecturing that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for any (reasonable) one-body potential @xmath . More generally,
introducing

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

we shall refer to a bound of the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

as an incompressibility estimate corresponding to a density bound

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

These bounds state that, whatever the external potential @xmath imposed
on the system, it is never possible to create a density bump above a
certain maximum value. Doing so might be energetically favorable to
accommodate the variations of @xmath , but is prohibited by the imposed
form @xmath .

#### 3.3.3. Unconditional incompressibility estimates

We can now state the main result of [ 307 ] :

###### Theorem 3.3.1 (Unconditional incompressibility for @xmath).

Let @xmath be increasing at infinity in the sense that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Then

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the bath-tub energy @xmath is defined as in ( 3.3.9 ).

As explained above, since this result holds for a very large class of
potentials @xmath , it can be interpreted as a weak formulation of the
density bound

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It thus misses the conjectured optimal bound ( 3.3.4 ) by a factor
@xmath , but has the correct order of magnitude (mind the scaling in the
definition of the energy). To appreciate this we make the

###### Remark 3.3.2 (Illustrative comparisons).

How would the energy ( 3.3.5 ) behave in less constrained variational
sets ? Three interesting cases are worth considering, keeping in mind
that @xmath sets the energy scale, and can with no loss of generality be
chosen to be @xmath :

-    Particles outside the LLL. Suppose the single-particle Hilbert
    space was the full space @xmath instead of the constrained space
    @xmath . The minimization is then of course very simple and we would
    obtain @xmath by taking a minimizing sequence concentrating around a
    minimum point of @xmath .

-    Uncorrelated bosons in the LLL. For non interacting bosons in a
    strong magnetic field, one should consider the space @xmath , the
    symmetric tensor product of @xmath copies of the LLL. The infimum
    in ( 3.3.5 ) can then be computed considering uncorrelated trial
    states of the form @xmath , @xmath . LLL functions do satisfy a kind
    of incompressibility property because they are of the form
    holomorphic @xmath gaussian. This can be made precise by the
    inequality [ 8 , 55 , 213 ]

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (3.3.14)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    This is a much weaker notion however: it only leads to @xmath for
    @xmath . One may still construct a sequence of the form @xmath
    concentrating around a minimum point of @xmath without violating (
    3.3.14 ). The liminf in ( 3.3.13 ) is thus also equal to @xmath in
    this case.

-    Minimally correlated fermions in the LLL. Due to the Pauli
    exclusion principle, fermions can never be uncorrelated: the
    corresponding wave functions have to be antisymmetric w.r.t.
    exchange of particles:

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (3.3.15)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    For LLL wave functions (which are continuous) this implies

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    i.e. the wave function vanishes on the diagonals of the
    configuration space. Due to the holomorphy constraint, any @xmath
    -body LLL fermionic wave-function is then of the form ( 3.1.4 ), for
    @xmath . If @xmath , one could then talk of “minimally correlated”
    fermions. This case is covered by our theorem, and one obtains
    @xmath as a lower bound to the energy.

∎

We call the above an “unconditional” result, because it is obtained
under the sole assumption that the variational set for the energy @xmath
is given by ( 3.1.4 ). This is in contrast with the result we discuss
next, where the optimal bound ( 3.3.8 ) is obtained under an additional
assumption.

#### 3.3.4. Conditional optimal estimates

We can obtain a sharper result than Theorem 3.3.1 if we follow
Laughlin’s original intuition that particles are correlated only
pairwise. This means that @xmath contains only two-body correlation
factors, i.e. that it can be written in the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with @xmath and @xmath two polynomials ( @xmath being in addition a
symmetric function of @xmath ). We also assume

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

for some constant @xmath independent of @xmath . The degree of @xmath is
here understood as the degree of the polynomial in @xmath with @xmath
fixed (and vice versa). Assumptions ( 3.3.16 ) and ( 3.3.17 ) are, of
course, restrictive, but still cover a huge class of functions with
possibly very intricate correlations.

Then, defining

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and the corresponding ground state energy

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

we have

###### Theorem 3.3.3 (Conditional optimal incompressibility estimates).

Let @xmath be increasing at infinity as in Theorem 3.3.1 . Then

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This is a weak formulation of the optimal density bound ( 3.3.4 ), under
a reasonable but unproven assumption on the states we minimize over. To
see that the lower bound ( 3.3.20 ) is indeed optimal and can, at least
in some cases, be achieved with a function of the form ( 3.1.7 ), we
state a result that follows rather straightforwardly from the analysis
of “quasi-holes trial states” in [ 305 ] (see Theorem 3.2.4 ):

###### Corollary 3.3.4 (Optimization of the energy in radial
potentials).

Let @xmath be as in Theorems 3.3.1 and 3.3.3 . Assume further that
@xmath is radial, has at most polynomial growth at infinity, and
satisfies one of the two following assumptions

1.  @xmath is radially increasing,

2.  @xmath has a “mexican-hat” shape: @xmath has a single local maximum
    at the origin and a single global minimum at some radius @xmath .

Then for @xmath large enough we have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

More precisely, in case @xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and in case @xmath one can find a fixed number @xmath and a sequence
@xmath with @xmath as @xmath such that, defining

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

we have

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Note that the potentials considered in Section 3.2 are of the form
above. That the Laughlin state itself is always (asymptotically) optimal
in case @xmath , whatever the rate of growth of @xmath , is a strong
manifestation of its rigidity. The only way to accommodate a steeper
potential barrier by creating a density maximum around the origin is to
leave the Laughlin phase ( 3.1.4 ), at the expense of increasing either
the kinetic energy or the interaction energy.

#### 3.3.5. Hints of proofs

As for the proof of Theorem 3.2.4 , the starting point is Laughlin’s
plasma analogy, which is reminiscent of the log-gas analogy in random
matrix theory [ 19 , 107 , 121 , 134 , 258 ] . The crucial observation [
187 , 188 ] is that the absolute square of the wave-function ( 3.1.3 )
can be regarded as the Gibbs state of a 2D Coulomb gas (one-component
plasma). To prove Theorems 3.3.1 and 3.3.3 , we generalize this idea and
map any state of @xmath to a Gibbs state of a classical Hamiltonian.

Let us consider a function of the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the Laughlin state ( 3.1.3 ), @xmath is holomorphic and
symmetric and @xmath is a normalization factor. The idea is simply to
write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and interpret @xmath as a classical Hamilton function. One of the
reasons why this is an effective procedure is that we can take advantage
of the good scaling properties of @xmath to first change variables and
obtain a classical Gibbs states with mean-field two-body interactions
and small effective temperature . Specifically, we define

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath ensures normalization of @xmath in @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the classical Hamiltonian is of the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We have here written

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.28)
  -- -------- -- ----------

for the 2D Coulomb kernel and defined

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We are ultimately interested in an incompressibility bound of the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.30)
  -- -------- -- ----------

in an appropriate weak sense, independently of the details of @xmath .
Here, the @xmath -th marginal of @xmath is defined as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The function ( 3.3.29 ) can be rather intricate and represents in
general a genuine @xmath -body interaction term of the Hamiltonian (
3.3.27 ). The only thing we know a priori about @xmath is that it is
superharmonic in each of its variables :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.31)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which follows from the fact that @xmath is holomorphic. Under the
additional assumption that @xmath belongs to @xmath , it is possible to
regard @xmath as a few-body interaction in a mean-field like scaling.
Then, a mean-field approximation for @xmath can be rigorously proven to
be accurate: We first justify that an ansatz of the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.32)
  -- -------- -- ----------

is effective for deriving density bounds on @xmath . We then show that
the appropriate @xmath should minimize an effective mean-field energy
functional, and thus satisfy a variational equation, depending on @xmath
. Using this equation jointly with ( 3.3.31 ) we obtain that the optimal
@xmath always satisfies

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and Theorem 3.3.3 follows. The difficult part in this approach is the
justification of the ansatz ( 3.3.32 ). In the general case there does
not seem to be any reason why it should be a good approximation, and
another strategy is called for.

There is another way to bound the one-particle density in ground states
of Coulomb systems without using any mean-field approximation. The
argument is due to Lieb (unpublished), and variants thereof have been
used recently in [ 278 , 293 , 303 ] . It is based solely on some
properties of the Coulomb kernel and general superharmonicity arguments,
so that it can be adapted to Hamiltonians of the form ( 3.3.27 ). Our
strategy to prove Theorem 3.3.1 is then the following:

-   We adapt Lieb’s argument to obtain a bound on the minimal separation
    of points in the ground state configurations . This implies a local
    density upper bound at the level of the ground state, but not yet
    the Gibbs state ( 3.3.26 ).

-   We exploit the fact that ( 3.3.26 ) is a Gibbs state for @xmath with
    small temperature @xmath in the limit @xmath . It is thus reasonable
    to expect the density bound on the ground state to also apply to the
    Gibbs state.

-   More precisely, appropriate upper and lower bounds to the
    free-energy @xmath confirm that it is close to the ground state
    energy of @xmath in the limit @xmath . Applying these bounds to a
    suitably perturbed Hamiltonian gives the desired estimates on the
    density by a Feynman-Hellmann type argument, i.e. by evaluating the
    derivative of the free-energy with respect to the perturbation.

## Chapter 4 On the classical Coulomb gas

Classical Coulomb systems are most central objects (see [ 323 , 324 ]
for reviews) in statistical mechanics, random matrix theory and
fractional quantum Hall physics (see Chapter 3 for this latter aspect).
They can be seen as a toy model for matter, containing the truly
long-range nature of electrostatic interactions. As was pointed out by
Wigner [ 352 , 353 ] and Dyson [ 107 , 108 , 109 ] , two-dimensional
Coulomb systems are directly related to Gaussian random matrices, more
precisely the Ginibre ensemble, and such random matrix models have also
received much attention for their own sake. A similar connection exists
between ‘‘log-gases” in dimension 1 and the GUE ¹ ¹ 1 Gaussian Unitary
Ensemble. and GOE ² ² 2 Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble. ensembles of
random matrices, as well as more indirectly to orthogonal polynomial
ensembles. For more details on these aspects we refer to [ 121 ] , and
for an introduction to the random matrix aspect to the texts [ 19 , 258
] .

In this chapter we discuss the main results of [ 303 ] . We shall be
concerned with the mean-field regime for many-particles trapped Coulomb
gases in any dimension @xmath , thus in particular the most physically
relevant case @xmath , and the case of interest for random matrix
theory, vortices in superfluids and quantum Hall physics @xmath . Some
of the methods can be applied to the one-dimensional log-gas (where the
interaction kernel is @xmath ) see [ 313 ] . Our goal is to
characterize, in terms of a new object, the renormalized jellium energy,
the fluctuations around mean-field theory in low temperature equilibrium
states. Results include

-   a subleading order expansion of the ground state energy and
    asymptotic results on corresponding equilibrium configurations that
    reveal a two scale structure,

-   a characterization of the microscopic distribution of charges in
    terms of the jellium problem,

-   similar results for the Gibbs states at sufficiently low
    temperature, together with free-energy estimates leading to a
    natural conjecture on the liquid to crystal phase transition,

-   precise estimates on the accuracy of mean-field theory for different
    observables of the systems.

We refer to [ 278 , 293 , 192 , 191 , 193 , 194 ] for more recent
developments.

We start by a short introduction to the problem in Section 4.1 , briefly
reviewing what is known about the mean-field limit on a macroscopic
scale. We then heuristically discuss the physics that should be expected
to govern the microscopic scale in Section 4.2 . This leads us to
defining the jellium renormalized energy, in a new, more flexible way
(as opposed to the previous works [ 312 , 314 ] ). We then state our
main results in two separate subsections, one concerning the ground
state problem, Section 4.3 , one concerning the equilibrium states at
positive temperature 4.4 . Finally, we state results quantifying the
precision of mean-field theory, obtained as corollaries of the main line
of attack, in Section 4.5 .

### 4.1. The Coulomb gas in the mean-field limit

Denoting @xmath the positions of the particles, the total energy at rest
of our system is given by the Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is a multiple of the Coulomb potential in dimensions @xmath , i.e. we
have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and @xmath is the Dirac mass at the origin. The one-body potential
@xmath is a continuous function, growing at infinity ( confining
potential). More precisely, we assume

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

For simplicity, we assume in this chapter that @xmath is smooth, see [
303 ] for the optimal assumptions. Note the factor @xmath in front of
the one-body term (second term) in ( 4.1.1 ) that puts us in a
mean-field scaling where the one-body energy and the two-body energy
(first term) are of the same order of magnitude. This choice is
equivalent to demanding that the pair-interaction strength be of order
@xmath . By scaling, one can always reduce to this situation in the
particular case where the trapping potential @xmath has some
homogeneity, which is particularly important in applications.

We are interested in equilibrium properties of the system in the regime
@xmath , that is on the large particle number asymptotics of the ground
state and the Gibbs state at given temperature. In the former case we
consider configurations @xmath that minimize the total energy ( 4.1.1 ).
We will denote

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

the ground state energy. To characterize ground state configurations we
shall consider the asymptotics of the empirical measure

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

At positive temperature we study the Gibbs state at inverse temperature
@xmath , i.e. the probability law ³ ³ 3 Remark the conventions in the
units, chosen to comply with standard choices in random matrix theory.

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a normalization constant (partition function). By
definition, the Gibbs measure minimizes the @xmath -body free energy
functional

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

over probability measures @xmath . We also have the standard relation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

between the minimal free-energy and the partition function @xmath .

In the mean-field regime of our interest, it is fairly standard to
derive the leading-order behavior of these objects when @xmath , as we
now recall.

#### 4.1.1. The mean-field regime: continuum limit

It is well-known that to leading order

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

in the limit @xmath where

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

is the mean-field energy functional defined for Radon measures @xmath ,
and @xmath (the equilibrium measure) is the minimizer of @xmath amongst
probability measures on @xmath . The functional ( 4.1.12 ) is nothing
but the continuum energy corresponding to ( 4.1.1 ): the first term is
the classical Coulomb interaction energy of the charge distribution
@xmath and the second the potential energy in the potential @xmath . If
the interaction potential @xmath was regular at the origin we could use
the empirical measure ( 4.1.7 ) to write

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath            
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

and ( 4.1.11 ) would easily follow from a simple compactness argument.
In the case where @xmath has a singularity at the origin, a
regularization procedure is needed but this mean-field limit result
still holds true, meaning that for minimizers of @xmath , the empirical
measure @xmath converges to @xmath , the minimizer of ( 4.1.12 ):

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

as measures. This is standard and can be found in a variety of sources.
The physics here is that (at least if @xmath is reasonably regular), the
many charges get confined in a bounded region of space and their
distribution thus converges to a continuum limit, given by minimizing
the continuum energy functional ( 4.1.12 ).

At small enough temperature (large enough @xmath ) one should
essentially expect that the above results hold @xmath -almost surely.
One can in fact derive a large deviation principle vindicating this
point, see [ 27 , 28 , 61 , 324 ] . For larger temperatures, the typical
behavior of the system is more easily guessed through an alternate point
of view on the mean-field regime, that we discuss next.

#### 4.1.2. The mean-field regime: vanishing of correlations

Another way to think of the mean-field limit, less immediate in the
present context but more suited for generalizations (see e.g. Chapter 5
), is as a regime of low correlations. In reality, particles are
indistinguishable, and the configuration of the system should thus be
described by a probability measure @xmath , which is symmetric under
particle exchange:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

A ground state configuration @xmath is found by minimizing the @xmath
-body energy functional

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

amongst symmetric probability measures @xmath . It is immediate to see
that @xmath must be a convex superposition of measures of the form
@xmath with @xmath minimizing @xmath (in other words it has to be a
symmetrization of some @xmath for a minimizing configuration @xmath ).
The infimum of the functional ( 4.1.15 ) of course coincides with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and a way to understand the asymptotic formula ( 4.1.11 ) is to think of
the minimizing @xmath as being almost factorized

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with a regular probability measure @xmath . Plugging this ansatz into (
4.1.15 ) we indeed obtain

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the optimal choice is @xmath . The mean-field limit can thus also be
understood as one where correlations amongst the particles of the system
vanish in the limit @xmath , which is the meaning of the factorized
ansatz.

This point of view readily generalizes to the Gibbs state. Imagine that
@xmath approximately factorizes:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and insert this ansatz in the free-energy functional ( 4.1.9 ). One
obtains the mean-field free-energy functional

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and the optimal choice of @xmath in ( 4.1.17 ) should minimize this
object. It is then clear that for @xmath , the entropy term becomes
negligible and we should expect ( 4.1.17 ) to hold with @xmath . At low
temperature we thus see no difference between Gibbs states and ground
states. For @xmath however the entropy is not negligible. Then ( 4.1.17
) should hold with @xmath the minimizer of ( 4.1.18 ). One way to give a
rigorous meaning to this is to consider the marginals

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

interpreted as the probability density for having one particle at @xmath
, one particle at @xmath , @xmath , and one particle at @xmath . Then
one can show [ 50 , 259 , 173 , 174 , 175 , 299 ] that for @xmath and
@xmath fixed

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and that for @xmath and @xmath fixed

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.1.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This essentially implies (see [ 156 , 260 , 261 ] and references therein
for discussions of this point) that for @xmath -almost every @xmath the
empirical measure converges to @xmath in case ( 4.1.20 ) and to @xmath
in case ( 4.1.21 ).

### 4.2. Beyond mean-field: the renormalized jellium energy

The main results of [ 303 ] concern the behavior of the Coulomb gas
beyond the mean-field asymptotics we just recalled. In this section we
motivate, and then define rigorously, an energy functional that is the
cornerstone of our approach. Previous versions of this object had been
defined, in 2D only, by Sandier and Serfaty [ 312 , 314 ] . The main
novelty here is to propose an alternate definition which is more wieldy
than the original one, in that it easily generalizes to higher
dimensions and significantly simplifies some proofs.

#### 4.2.1. Heuristics

As already mentioned, points minimizing @xmath tend to be densely packed
in a bounded region of space (the support of @xmath , that we shall
denote @xmath ) in the limit @xmath . Their distribution (i.e. the
empirical measure) has to follow @xmath on the macroscopic scale but
this requirement still leaves a lot of freedom on the configuration at
the microscopic scale , that is on length scales of order @xmath (the
mean inter-particle distance). A natural idea is thus to blow-up at
scale @xmath in order to consider configurations where points are
typically separated by distances of order unity, and investigate which
microscopic configuration is favored. On such length scales, the
equilibrium measure @xmath varies slowly so the points will want to
follow a constant density given locally by the value of @xmath . Since
the problem is electrostatic in nature it is intuitive that the correct
way to measure the distance between the configuration of points and the
local value of the equilibrium measure should use the Coulomb energy.
This leads to the idea that the local energy around a blow-up origin
should be the electrostatic energy of what is often called a jellium in
physics: an infinite collection of interacting particles in a constant
neutralizing background of opposite charge, a model originally
introduced in [ 351 ] . At this microscopic scale the pair-interactions
will no longer be of mean-field type, their strength will be of order
@xmath . A splitting formula will allow us to separate exactly the
Coulomb energy of this jellium as the next to leading order term, except
that what will come out is more precisely some average of all the
energies of the jellium configurations obtained after blow-up around all
possible origins.

Of course, it is a delicate matter to define the energy of the infinite
jellium in a mathematically rigorous way: one has to take into account
the pair-interaction energy of infinitely many charges, without assuming
any local charge neutrality, and the overall energy may be finite only
via screening effects between the charges and the neutralizing
background that are difficult to quantify. This has been done for the
first time in 2D in [ 312 , 314 ] , the energy functional for the
jellium being the renormalized energy @xmath alluded to above. As
already mentioned, one of the main contributions of the work reviewed
here is to present an alternate definition @xmath that generalizes
better to higher dimensions.

#### 4.2.2. The renormalized jellium energy

The renormalized energy is defined via the electric field @xmath
generated by the full charged system: a (typically infinite)
distribution of point charges in a constant neutralizing background.
Note first that the classical Coulomb interaction of two charge
distributions (bounded Radon measures) @xmath and @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is linked to the (electrostatic) potentials @xmath , @xmath that they
generate via the formula

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where we used the fact that by definition of @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The electric field generated by the distribution @xmath is given by
@xmath , and its square norm thus gives a constant times the
electrostatic energy density of the charge distribution @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The electric field generated by a jellium is of the form described in
the following definition.

###### Definition 4.2.1 (Admissible electric fields).

Let @xmath . Let @xmath be a vector field in @xmath . We say that @xmath
belongs to the class @xmath if @xmath with

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for some discrete set @xmath , and @xmath integers in @xmath .

In the present definition @xmath corresponds to the electrostatic
potential generated by the jellium and @xmath to its electric field,
while the constant @xmath represents the mean number of particles per
unit volume, or the density of the neutralizing background. An important
difficulty is that the electrostatic energy @xmath of a point charge,
where @xmath denotes the Dirac mass at @xmath , is infinite, or in other
words, that the electric field generated by point charges fails to be in
@xmath . This is where the need for a “renormalization” of this infinite
contribution comes from.

To remedy this, we replace point charges by smeared-out charges, as in
Onsager’s lemma [ 271 ] : We pick some arbitrary fixed radial
nonnegative function @xmath , supported in @xmath and with integral
@xmath . For any point @xmath and @xmath we introduce the smeared charge

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

A simple example is to take @xmath in which case

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We also define

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The numbers @xmath , @xmath , depend only on the choice of the function
@xmath and on the dimension. This non symmetric definition is due to the
fact that the logarithm behaves differently from power functions under
rescaling, and is made to simplify formulas below.

Newton’s theorem [ 219 , Theorem 9.7] asserts that the Coulomb
potentials generated by the smeared charge @xmath and the point charge
@xmath coincide outside of @xmath . A consequence of this is that there
exists a radial function @xmath solution to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and it is easy to define the field @xmath generated by a jellium with
smeared charges starting from the field of the jellium with (singular)
point charges, using @xmath :

###### Definition 4.2.2 (Smeared electric fields).

For any vector field @xmath satisfying

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

in some subset @xmath of @xmath , with @xmath a discrete set of points,
we let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and denoting by @xmath the map @xmath , we note that @xmath realizes a
bijection from the set of vector fields satisfying ( 4.2.7 ) and which
are gradients, to those satisfying ( 4.2.8 ) and which are also
gradients.

For any fixed @xmath one may then define the electrostatic energy per
unit volume of the infinite jellium with smeared charges as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is as in the above definition and @xmath denotes the cube
@xmath . Note that the quantity @xmath may not have a limit (this does
occur for somewhat pathological configurations). This motivates the use
of the @xmath instead.

This energy is now well-defined for @xmath and blows up as @xmath ,
since it includes the self-energy of each smeared charge in the
collection, absent in the original energy (i.e. in the Hamiltonian (
4.1.1 )). One should thus renormalize ( 4.2.9 ) by removing the
self-energy of each smeared charge before taking the limit @xmath . We
will see that the leading order energy of a smeared charge is @xmath ,
and this is the quantity that should be removed for each point. But in
order for the charges to efficiently screen the neutralizing background,
configurations will need to have the same charge density as the
neutralizing background (i.e. @xmath points per unit volume). We are
then led to the definition

###### Definition 4.2.3 (The renormalized energy).

For any @xmath , we define

  -- -- -- ----------
           (4.2.10)
  -- -- -- ----------

and the renormalized energy is given by

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

It is easy to see that if @xmath , then @xmath belongs to @xmath and

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.2.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

thus the same scaling formulae hold for @xmath . One may thus reduce to
the study of @xmath on @xmath , for which we have the following result:

###### Theorem 4.2.4 (Minimization of the renormalized energy).

The infimum

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.2.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

is achieved and is finite. Moreover, there exists a sequence @xmath of
periodic vector fields (with diverging period in the limit @xmath ) in
@xmath such that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.2.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We should stress at this point that the definition of the jellium
(renormalized) energy we use is essential for our approach to the study
of equilibrium states of ( 4.1.1 ). In particular it is crucial that we
are allowed to define the energy of an infinite system via a local
density (square norm of the electric field). For a different definition
of the jellium energy, the existence of the thermodynamic limit was
previously proved in [ 220 ] , using ideas from [ 195 , 218 ] . This
approach does not transpose easily in our context however, and our proof
that @xmath is finite follows a different route.

The natural, but so far unproven, conjecture is that @xmath can be
attained by a periodic (or crystalline) distribution of charge. In 2D,
it is known that the the optimal lattice is the triangular one [ 312 ] ,
but in higher dimensions, even the optimal arrangement amongst regular
lattices is unknown.

### 4.3. Asymptotics for the ground state

We are now equipped to investigate the corrections to ( 4.1.11 ) and (
4.1.13 ). The subleading behavior of the ground state energy is most
easily stated:

###### Theorem 4.3.1 (Expansion of the ground state energy).

Let @xmath denote the ground state energy ( 4.1.6 ) and @xmath denote
the minimum of @xmath for a jellium of density @xmath in dimension
@xmath , defined in Theorem 4.2.4 . In the limit @xmath , we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This result encodes the double scale nature of the charge distribution:
the first term is due to the points following the macroscopic
distribution @xmath – we assume that the probability @xmath has a
density that we also denote @xmath by abuse of notation. The next order
correction, which happens to lie at the order @xmath , governs the
configurations at the microscopic scale and the crystallization, by
selecting configurations which minimize @xmath (on average, with respect
to the blow-up centers).

The factors involving @xmath in the correction come from scaling, and
from the fact that the points locally see a neutralizing background
whose charge density is given by the value of @xmath . The scaling
properties of the renormalized energy imply that the minimal energy of a
jellium with neutralizing density @xmath is @xmath (respectively @xmath
when @xmath ). Integrating this energy density on the support of @xmath
leads to the formula.

The interpretation of the correction is thus that around (almost) any
point @xmath in the support of @xmath there are approximately @xmath
points per unit volume, distributed so as to minimize a jellium energy
with background density @xmath . Due to the properties of the jellium,
this implies that, up to a @xmath -dependent rescaling, the local
distribution of particles are the same around any blow-up origin @xmath
in the support of @xmath . This can be interpreted as a result of
universality with respect to the potential @xmath in ( 4.1.1 ), in
connection with recent works on the 1D log gas [ 39 , 40 , 192 , 313 ] .

We now proceed to give a rigorous meaning to the above, somewhat vague,
assertions about the ground state configurations. This requires a bit of
formalism. To describe the behavior of minimizers at the microscopic
scale we follow the same approach as in [ 314 ] and perform a blow-up:
For a given @xmath , we let @xmath and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Note that the associated electric field @xmath is in @xmath if and only
if @xmath . We next embed @xmath into the set of probabilities on @xmath
, for some @xmath . For any @xmath and @xmath we let @xmath where @xmath
and @xmath is the push-forward of the normalized Lebesgue measure on
@xmath by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Explicitly:

  -- -- -- ---------
           (4.3.3)
  -- -- -- ---------

This way @xmath is an element of @xmath , the set of probability
measures on @xmath (couples of blown-up centers, blown-up electric
fields) that measures the probability of having a given blown-up
electric field around a given blow-up point in @xmath . As suggested by
the above discussion, the natural object we should look at is really
@xmath and its limits up to extraction, @xmath .

Due to the fact that the renormalized jellium functional describing the
small-scale physics is invariant under translations of the electric
field, and by definition of @xmath , we should of course expect the
objects we have just introduced to have a certain translation
invariance, formalized as follows:

###### Definition 4.3.2 (@xmath-invariance).

We say a probability measure @xmath on @xmath is @xmath -invariant if
@xmath is invariant by @xmath , for any @xmath of class @xmath from
@xmath to @xmath .

Note that @xmath -invariant implies translation-invariant (simply take
@xmath ).

###### Definition 4.3.3 (Admissible configurations).

We say that @xmath is admissible if its first marginal is the normalized
Lebesgue measure on @xmath , if it holds for @xmath -a.e. @xmath that
@xmath , and if @xmath is @xmath -invariant.

We next define an “average with respect to blow-up centers” of @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.3.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

if @xmath is admissible, and @xmath otherwise. In view of the scaling
relation ( 4.2.11 ), we may guess that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.3.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Note that the minima on the right-hand side exist thanks to Theorem
4.2.4 . Also, the left-hand side is clearly larger than the right-hand
side in view of the definition of @xmath , that of admissible, and (
4.2.11 ). That there is actually equality is a consequence of the
following theorem on the behavior of ground state configurations (i.e.
minimizers of ( 4.1.1 )) :

###### Theorem 4.3.4 (Microscopic behavior of ground state
configurations).

Let @xmath minimize @xmath . Let @xmath be associated via ( 4.3.2 ) and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

be defined as in ( 4.3.3 ).

Up to extraction of a subsequence we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

in the sense of probability measures on @xmath , where @xmath is
admissible. Moreover, @xmath is a minimizer of @xmath and @xmath
minimizes @xmath over @xmath for @xmath -a.e. @xmath .

If the crystallization conjecture is correct, and if the only minimizers
of @xmath are periodic configurations, this means that after blow-up
around (almost) any point in @xmath , one should see a crystalline
configuration of points, the one minimizing @xmath , packed at the scale
corresponding to @xmath .

### 4.4. Asymptotics for the Gibbs states

We now turn to the case of positive temperature and study the Gibbs
measure ( 4.1.8 ). We shall need a slight strengthening of the
assumption ( 4.1.5 ): we assume that there exists @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.4.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We first state a generalization of Theorem 4.3.1 to positive
temperature:

###### Theorem 4.4.1 (Free energy/partition function estimates).

The following estimates hold in the limit @xmath .

1.   (Low temperature regime). Let @xmath be as in ( 4.3.5 ). For @xmath
    we have

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (4.4.2)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    if @xmath and

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (4.4.3)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    if @xmath .

2.   (High temperature regime). If @xmath and @xmath

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (4.4.4)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    respectively if @xmath and @xmath

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (4.4.5)
      -- -------- -- ---------

The dichotomy in the above suggests strongly that the liquid to crystal
transition must happen in the temperature regime @xmath . Indeed, for
lower temperatures, the free-energy can basically not be distinguished
from the ground state energy, and the occurrence of the jellium ground
state energy as the subleading order suggests crystallization of typical
thermal configurations. On the contrary, for larger temperature ⁴ ⁴ 4
Remark the small gap between the two regimes in 2D, due to scaling
properties of the @xmath kernel. , the subleading term is of entropic
nature, which suggests a melting of the crystal. This picture has been
recently strengthened in [ 194 , 191 ] by a more detail study of the
critical regime @xmath .

Our next result exposes the consequences of the low temperature
estimates ( 4.4.2 )-( 4.4.3 ) for the Gibbs measure itself. Roughly
speaking, we prove that it charges only configurations whose
renormalized energy @xmath is below a certain threshold. This is a large
deviations type upper bound, at speed @xmath . The threshold of
renormalized energy vanishes in the limit @xmath , showing that the
Gibbs measure charges only configurations that minimize the renormalized
energy at the microscopic scale. This is a step towards a proof of
crystallization, in that the crystallization for the thermal states in
the low temperature regime is reduced to a question (still open) about
ground states of the jellium problem.

The statement below uses the same framework as Theorem 4.3.4 , in terms
of the limiting probability measures @xmath , which should now be seen
as random, due to the temperature. We consider the limit of the
probability that the system is in a state @xmath for a given sequence of
sets @xmath in configuration space. Associated to this sequence we
introduce

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.4.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is as in ( 4.3.3 ) with @xmath and the convergence is
weakly as measures. The set @xmath can be thought of as the limsup of
the sequence @xmath .

###### Theorem 4.4.2 (Behavior of thermal states in the low temperature
regime).

For any @xmath let @xmath and @xmath be as above. Let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and @xmath be as in ( 4.3.5 ). Assume @xmath . There exists @xmath such
that @xmath for @xmath and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.4.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Note that the error term @xmath becomes negligible when @xmath . Thus
the Gibbs measure concentrates on minimizers of @xmath in that regime.
When @xmath , we have instead a threshold phenomenon: the Gibbs measure
concentrates on configurations whose @xmath is below the minimum plus
@xmath .

### 4.5. Fluctuations around mean-field theory

Our methods also yield some quantitative estimates on the fluctuations
around the equilibrium measure. These are obtained through nice
coercivity properties of (precursors of) the renormalized energy
functional. We shall focus on the low temperature regime for
concreteness and stress that the following estimates are insufficient
for a strong crystallization result (estimates on the location of
charges down to the optimal scale @xmath ). They however set bounds on
the possible deviations from mean-field theory in a stronger sense than
what has been considered so far in this memoir. In this sense they can
come in handy if such estimates are needed in applications (compare with
Theorem 3.2.4 in the previous chapter).

We shall estimate the following quantity, defined for any configuration
@xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.5.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

i.e. the deviation of the charge contained in a ball @xmath with respect
to the prediction drawn from the equilibrium measure. Here

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.5.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Note that since @xmath is a fixed bounded function, the second term in (
4.5.1 ) is of order @xmath , and typically the difference of the two
terms is much smaller than this, since the distribution of points at
least approximately follows the equilibrium measure.

We state three typical results:

1.  the probability of a large deviation of the number of points in a
    ball @xmath (i.e. a deviation of order @xmath ) is exponentially
    small as soon as @xmath .

2.  the probability of a charge deviation of order @xmath in a
    macroscopic ball @xmath with @xmath is exponentially small.

3.  an estimate on the discrepancy between @xmath and the equilibrium
    measure @xmath in weak Sobolev norms.

We denote @xmath the dual of the Sobolev space @xmath with @xmath , in
particular @xmath is the dual of Lipschitz functions.

###### Theorem 4.5.1 (Charge fluctuations).

Assume there is a constant @xmath such that @xmath . Then the following
holds for any @xmath .

1.   (Large fluctuations on microscopic scales). Let @xmath be a
    sequence of radii satisfying @xmath for some constant @xmath . Then,
    for any @xmath we have, for @xmath large enough,

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (4.5.3)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    for some @xmath depending only on dimension.

2.   (Small fluctuations at the macroscopic scale). Let @xmath be a
    fixed radius. There is a constant @xmath depending only on dimension
    such that for any @xmath , for @xmath large enough,

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (4.5.4)
      -- -------- -- ---------

3.   (Control in weak Sobolev norms). Let @xmath be some fixed radius.
    Let @xmath and define

      -- -------- -------- --
         @xmath   @xmath   
         @xmath   @xmath   
      -- -------- -------- --

    There is a constant @xmath such that the following holds for @xmath
    large enough, and any @xmath large enough,

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (4.5.5)
      -- -------- -- ---------

As regards ( 4.5.5 ), note that only estimates in @xmath norm with
@xmath make sense, since a Dirac mass is in @xmath if and only if @xmath
(hence the same for @xmath ). In view of the values of the parameters
@xmath and @xmath defined above, our results give meaningful estimates
for any such norm: a large deviation in a ball of fixed radius would be
a deviation of order @xmath . Since @xmath , equation ( 4.5.5 ) above
implies that such deviations are exponentially unlikely in @xmath for
any @xmath , in particular in @xmath for any space dimension.

Finally, we return to the “uncorrelated point of view” on the mean field
limit, stating some consequences for the reduced densities ( 4.1.19 ) of
the Gibbs state:

###### Corollary 4.5.2 (Reduced densities in the low temperature
regime).

Let @xmath be some fixed radius, @xmath . Under the same assumptions as
Theorem 4.5.1 , there exists a constant @xmath depending only on the
dimension such that the following holds:

-    (Estimate on the one-particle reduced density).

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (4.5.6)
      -- -------- -- ---------

-    (Estimate on @xmath -particle reduced densities). Let @xmath and
    @xmath be a smooth function with compact support, symmetric w.r.t.
    particle exchange. Then we have

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (4.5.7)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    where @xmath .

As our other results, Corollary 4.5.2 concerns the low temperature
regime. One may use the same technique to estimate the discrepancy
between the @xmath -body problem and mean-field theory in other regimes.
When @xmath becomes small however (large temperature), in particular
when @xmath so that entropy and energy terms in ( 4.1.18 ) are of the
same order of magnitude, a different method can give slightly better
estimates, see the original paper for details.

## Chapter 5 Ground states of large bosonic systems

The quest for Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) is a long story that
spanned most of the 20th century, from the original theoretical
prediction [ 38 , 112 ] to the first experimental realizations [ 81 ,
171 ] . In short, one of the main questions is to understand why, how,
and when, a system of bosons ¹ ¹ 1 i.e. quantum particles that do not
satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle. shows macroscopic occupancy, with
most particles residing in a single quantum state. This phenomenon paves
the way for the direct observation of macroscopic quantum effects, such
as superfluidity, alluded to in Section 2.1 of this memoir.

Ultimately, one would like to derive the existence of a critical
temperature under which BEC occurs in thermal equilibrium states of an
interacting bosonic system. This question is still mostly open from a
mathematical point of view, and shall be touched upon only in Chapter 6
below. In fact, for interacting Bose gases, even the existence of BEC in
the zero-temperature ground states is a very delicate question. In this
chapter we shall summarize the papers [ 204 , 206 , 208 , 205 , 267 ]
that deal with this issue. The general goal is to show that, in
appropriate scaling limits, the many-body bosonic problem reduces, at
the level of the ground state, to the study of effective one-body
nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) theories.

This problem corresponds to the existence of “molecular chaos” in
related fields such as kinetic theory. It logically precedes the
“propagation of chaos” problem. The latter deals with the same question
at the level of the appropriate evolution equation. Indeed, in the
dynamical problem, one assumes BEC and emergence of NLS theory (or
molecular chaos) in the initial datum and shows that it is propagated in
time by the many-body Schrödinger flow. The rationale is that, in most
experiments, the initial datum is a ground state for some many-body
Hamiltonian, and the evolution is generated by a sudden perturbation
thereof.

The chapter is organized as follows:

-   Section 5.1 sets the stage and discusses the various mathematical
    problems addressed here. There is actually a large variety of models
    and scalings for which one would like to study basically the same
    kind of questions. Several of these are described here, emphasizing
    various key difficulties one may encounter in the analysis.

-   Section 5.2 addresses the quantum de Finetti theorems, focusing on
    contributions from the author, together with Mathieu Lewin and Phan
    Thành Nam [ 204 , 206 ] . These tools offer a lot of flexibility in
    dealing with the problems discussed in Section 5.1 . Indeed, they
    describe remarkable structural properties of general admissible
    states for large bosonic systems. They can thus be applied (almost)
    independently of the particular physics at hand, provided one is
    dealing with bosons. This observation is the main key in the
    research program summarized in this chapter.

-   Section 5.3 contains the main results of [ 204 , 208 ] . They
    concern so-called mean-field limits where the occurrence of BEC is a
    consequence of inter-particles interactions being weak but frequent.
    In this case, very general proof strategies can be implemented,
    resting solely on the quantum de Finetti theorems and general tools
    of many-body quantum mechanics. Very little of the properties of the
    Hamiltonians at hand enter the proof strategy.

-   Section 5.4 is concerned with the more challenging, but also more
    experimentally relevant, dilute regimes wherein BEC occurs because
    interactions are strong but rare. Here one has to complement the
    very general tools discussed so far with methods and estimates more
    directly linked to specific models. We shall discuss a new treatment
    of the Gross-Pitaevskii limit for the 3D Bose gas [ 267 ] and a
    derivation of 2D NLS theory in the presence of possibly attractive
    interactions [ 205 ] .

More general discussions and extensive lists of references on various
aspects of the topics discussed here may be found in [ 36 , 95 , 96 ,
277 , 281 , 119 , 77 ] (physics literature) and [ 2 , 30 , 141 , 200 ,
227 , 299 , 300 , 315 , 318 , 344 ] (mathematics literature).

### 5.1. Models and scaling regimes

Let us first introduce the general type of problems we will be
interested in. All these being formulated in roughly the same way, they
should ideally also be treated in the same way. The results of this
chapter can be seen as means to this end.

#### 5.1.1. A general Hamiltonian

The Hamilton operator we will consider in this chapter can be written in
the general form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

acting on

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

as appropriate for a system made of bosons, whose many-body wave
function must satisfy the symmetry condition

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for every permutation @xmath of @xmath indices.

This model is not the most general one that can be dealt with using the
tools discussed here. However, it can already include most of the
technical difficulties one might encounter, as discussed below. As far
as applications are concerned, this is, to the best of the author’s
knowledge, the most general form relevant for the cold atoms experiments
where BEC is observed. Indeed

-   The space dimension @xmath can be @xmath , all three cases being
    relevant to current experiments. One can even allow for larger
    @xmath , with less practical relevance of course.

-   We allow for the presence of a gauge vector potential @xmath , which
    can reflect the fact that the problem is formulated in a rotating
    frame, model a (possibly artificial) magnetic field …

-   The one-body potential @xmath can be either trapping (increasing) or
    decaying at infinity.

-   We make no structural assumption on the interaction potential @xmath
    . We do not assume a priori that it has a sign, nor that its Fourier
    transform has. Provided stability holds, we can thus deal with
    either attractive or repulsive interactions.

-   We consider a general family of scaling limits by choosing @xmath of
    the form

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (5.1.4)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    Here @xmath shall be a fixed parameter in the limit @xmath . The
    larger it is, the more singular the interaction potential. The
    prefactor @xmath makes the one-body and two-body terms of ( 5.1.1 )
    of the same order of magnitude, so that one may hope for a
    well-defined limit problem. The potential @xmath has a fixed
    integral, so that one should think of it as being of order @xmath
    when @xmath .

In this chapter we are interested in the ground state problem of
minimizing the energy corresponding to ( 5.1.1 ):

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and in the associated minimizers (if they exist) or minimizing
sequences. Equivalently, we consider the lowest eigenvalue (or bottom of
the essential spectrum), and associated (generalized) eigenfunctions, of
@xmath .

#### 5.1.2. Limit problems

Roughly speaking, one is interested in showing that a minimizer of (
5.1.5 ) has, in a certain sense to be discussed below, all its particles
in the same quantum state. If one assumes this to be true and picks as
ansatz a pure BEC of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

evaluating the energy leads to a NLS-like functional

  -- -- -- ---------
           (5.1.6)
  -- -- -- ---------

Here, @xmath and @xmath are inherited from ( 5.1.1 ) but @xmath can
depend on the context. For @xmath in ( 5.1.4 ) one makes the obvious
choice @xmath . For @xmath the natural guess should be @xmath but this
can be misleading in some cases (an important example shall be discussed
in the sequel).

If we expect the guess @xmath to be correct, then the linear many-body
minimization problem ( 5.1.5 ) should be connected for @xmath large to
the nonlinear one-body minimization problem

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We shall denote a minimizer by @xmath if it exists. It might not be
unique, in which case we denote by @xmath the set of all minimizers.

#### 5.1.3. A meta-theorem

We now state a vague general theorem relating the minimization
problems ( 5.1.5 ) and ( 5.1.7 ). This statement will serve as a model
and will be declined in several rigorous avatars in the sequel,
depending on the various concrete choices of settings we will make.

The main thing we still have to specify is in which sense the
approximation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for a ground state (or approximate ground state) @xmath of ( 5.1.1 ) is
correct, where @xmath is a ground state for ( 5.1.6 ). Clearly, this
cannot be a convergence since both objects depend on @xmath . There are
known obstructions to obtaining an estimate in norm [ 103 , 145 , 210 ,
268 , 319 ] , connected to Bogoliubov’s theory. Moreover, there might
not be a unique relevant @xmath .

For all these reasons, the convergence of states will be expressed in
terms of the reduced density matrices of @xmath rather than on the
wave-function itself. Let us recall the definition: the reduced @xmath
-particles density matrix of @xmath is the positive trace-class operator
on @xmath defined by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the orthogonal projector onto @xmath , and the partial
trace can be taken, because of the symmetry ( 5.1.3 ), on any choice of
@xmath variables amongst the @xmath original ones. Note our choice of
normalization: @xmath has trace @xmath for all @xmath if @xmath is
@xmath -normalized.

We can now state the informal statement that will serve as a model for
more rigorous versions in the rest of the chapter:

###### Statement 5.1.1 (Derivation of NLS theory, informal version).

Suppose that the data @xmath and @xmath of the many-body Hamiltonian (
5.1.1 ) are such that @xmath makes sense as a self-adjoint operator, and
is bounded from below by @xmath for @xmath fixed. Then the energy
functional ( 5.1.7 ) is bounded from below and we have

1.   Convergence of the ground-state energy :

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (5.1.9)
      -- -------- -- ---------

2.   Convergence of states : let @xmath be a sequence of approximate
    minimizers for @xmath , i.e.

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    for large @xmath . Let @xmath be the corresponding reduced density
    matrix, defined as in ( 5.1.8 ). Then

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (5.1.10)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    weakly- @xmath in the trace-class when @xmath , where @xmath is a
    Borel probability measure concentrated on the weak limits of
    minimizing sequences for ( 5.1.7 ).

3.   Bose-Einstein condensation : if the infimum in ( 5.1.7 ) is reached
    at a unique (modulo a constant phase) @xmath , then

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (5.1.11)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    strongly in the trace-class when @xmath

A few comments:

-   Since this is not supposed to be a rigorous statement yet, we are a
    bit sloppy on the assumptions. Ideally they reduce to those ensuring
    that both the @xmath -body theory and the one-body NLS theory are
    reasonably well-defined. In most cases, we manage to get pretty
    close to that minimal requirement.

-   The choice of the effective interaction potential @xmath in ( 5.1.6
    ) depends on the value of @xmath . The larger it is, the harder the
    analysis, and one ideally wants to be able to push it as far as one
    can.

-   The fact that @xmath as an operator will in practice be part of the
    statement, under specified, more explicit, assumptions on the data
    of the problem.

-   Equation ( 5.1.10 ), involving a statistical mixtures of NLS
    “minimizers” described by the measure @xmath , is due to the fact
    that the latter might not be unique. This case does occur in several
    physically relevant situations and then one cannot hope for a
    stronger result.

-   The statement ( 5.1.10 ) is complicated by the fact that @xmath
    might not have minimizers. In this case, minimizing sequences for
    the NLS problem will only converge weakly in @xmath . This case does
    occur if the one-body potential @xmath is not strong enough to bind
    all particles (loss of compactness at infinity). If all minimizing
    sequences for @xmath converge strongly, the measure @xmath charges
    only minimizers, and since they all have mass @xmath , the
    convergence in ( 5.1.10 ) is strong in the trace-class.

-   The result ( 5.1.11 ) implies BEC in the usual sense: the
    eigenvalues of the one-body density matrix are interpreted as the
    (normalized) occupation numbers of single-particle orbitals present
    in a many-body state. The convergence in trace-class to a projector
    implies that one and only one of these occupation numbers is
    macroscopic. It corresponds to the single quantum state occupied by
    most of the particles.

Before we proceed to state several rigorous versions of Statement 5.1.1
in Sections 5.3 and 5.4 , we explain the general character of the result
by listing several key variations on a same theme that are included in
the above. We hope this will make it clear that general tools,
independent of the details of the Hamiltonian ( 5.1.1 ), are needed.
Section 5.2 is devoted to the discussion of the most useful of such
tools, that is used repeatedly to prove the rigorous versions of
Statement 5.1.1 .

#### 5.1.4. Several sources of mathematical difficulties

The ideal case for the above problem is that where @xmath , @xmath is
trapping, @xmath and @xmath is of positive type (positive Fourier
transform @xmath ). When the Hamiltonian has such a nice structure, one
may use it to give a relatively simple proof of Theorem 5.1.1 . This
approach has been pioneered in [ 31 ] and is used repeatedly in the
literature [ 319 , 145 , 320 ] . If instead @xmath , one can still
proceed [ 239 ] by using a trick due to Lévy-Leblond [ 199 , 237 ] . One
can actually merge the two methods [ 200 ] to deal with a general @xmath
but, at this stage, things are already considerably trickier. In fact,
violating any of the above conditions leads to considerable
difficulties, as we now explain.

1.  If @xmath , the Hoffmann-Ostenhof inequality [ 159 ] is not
    available, and one has thus no simple way of connecting the
    many-body kinetic energy to a one-body object. Moreover, for @xmath
    the bosonic ground state in general does not coincide with the
    absolute ground state (with no symmetry restriction). Deriving the
    NLS functional then requires to take bosonic symmetry explicitly
    into account. On top of that, the minimizer for the limit problem is
    then generically not unique, which causes difficulties in the proof.

2.  If @xmath is not trapping, it is far from obvious that one can pass
    to the limit in the energy, because a lack of compactness occurs at
    infinity. Mass may be lost if the potential is not strong enough to
    bind all particles, leading to a dichotomy situation in the
    concentration-compactness principle [ 243 , 244 , 245 ] . This is
    reflected by the convergence ( 5.1.10 ) being a priori only weak-
    @xmath .

3.  If @xmath there are in fact two limits to deal with at the same
    time: large particle number and short-range interaction. Compactness
    arguments are then either totally useless, or at least very
    difficult to employ. Moreover, the singularity of the interaction
    for large @xmath could quite simply render the result false.

4.  Note also that there is a clear physical dichotomy between the cases
    @xmath where the range of the interaction is much larger than the
    typical interparticle distance, and @xmath where it is the opposite.
    In the former case, interactions are frequent but weak, in the
    latter they are rare but strong. Nevertheless, the general result
    looks pretty much the same, although the choice of the effective
    potential can become subtle for large @xmath .

5.  One way to understand the emergence of ( 5.1.6 ) is that the
    particles become almost independent and identically distributed.
    That the interactions take a mean-field form is then a consequence
    of the law of large numbers. If @xmath has no particular structure,
    it is not so easy to understand why particles should become
    approximately independent in the limit.

Strategies based on structural properties of @xmath are particularly
sensitive to these difficulties, especially if at least two of them
occur at the same time. The general idea in the sequel is to avoid as
much as possible using the structure of the Hamiltonian. One can instead
rely on a remarkable property of bosonic states themselves, that is of
wave-functions satisfying ( 5.1.3 ). For ease of notation we focus on
the model ( 5.1.1 ) which includes the above sources of difficulties,
but let us quickly mention other possible generalizations not explicitly
considered here:

-   The dispersion relation could be more complicated, that is we could
    replace the (magnetic) Laplacian by a fractional (magnetic)
    Laplacian or a variant thereof. This is of relevance for
    relativistic bosonic systems.

-   The interaction term could be more general. Three-body or @xmath
    -body interactions for arbitrary @xmath could be included in the
    model. The interaction operator could also be a more general
    operator, e.g. mixing position and momentum variables. We refer to
    Section 7.3 where we shall be lead to consider such cases.

-   The Hilbert space could be restricted, and the Hamiltonian projected
    accordingly, to model particles constrained by very strong external
    forces. The particles could live on a lattice instead of in the
    continuum for example (tight-binding approximation) or in the lowest
    Landau level (large magnetic field limit).

-   More generally, at least for a trapped mean-field-like situation
    corresponding to @xmath and @xmath trapping, one could consider a
    fully abstract model, with a general separable Hilbert space @xmath
    replacing @xmath , and an abstract operator acting on @xmath .

### 5.2. Structure of bosonic states: quantum de Finetti theorems

Roughly speaking, the quantum de Finetti theorem asserts that any @xmath
-body bosonic state looks, for large @xmath , as a convex combination
(statistical mixture) of pure BECs. Let @xmath be any separable complex
Hilbert space and @xmath a (sequence of) bosonic @xmath -body states.
Thus @xmath is a self-adjoint, positive, trace-class operator on @xmath
, e.g. @xmath for @xmath . Then, modulo extraction of a subsequence, one
should have in mind an approximation of the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath a Borel probability measure on the one-body Hilbert space
@xmath . Thus, for large @xmath , there are so to say only pure BECs in
the @xmath -body state space. Of course the latter is convex, so it must
also obviously contain convex combinations of BECs, as in the right-hand
of ( 5.2.1 ), but these are, for many practical purposes, the only
relevant possibilities. The energy functional appearing in ( 5.1.5 )
being a linear function of @xmath , it becomes intuitively clear that it
is energetically favorable to have a single BEC as an approximate ground
state, provided one is able to pass to the large @xmath limit in the
energy.

There is actually a condition that @xmath should satisfy, namely it
should be a few-body Hamiltonian including only @xmath -body terms for
@xmath fixed, or at least @xmath small compared to @xmath . This is
because the correct meaning one should give to ( 5.2.1 ) involves
reduced density matrices: let

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The true statement is that, modulo extraction of a subsequence
independent of @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the measure @xmath does not depend on @xmath . This kind of result
is a quantum analogue of the famous classical de Finetti/Hewitt-Savage
theorem [ 98 , 99 , 158 , 104 , 156 , 261 , 246 , 11 , 170 ] , used
extensively to deal with classical mean-field limits. The quantum
version originates in [ 332 , 162 ] . Recent variants and improvements
may be found in [ 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 70 , 118 , 184 , 67 , 155 ] . In
this section we describe two results obtained jointly with Mathieu Lewin
and Phan Thành Nam, respectively in [ 206 ] and [ 204 ] . Put together,
these lead to a fully constructive proof of (the rigorous version of) (
5.2.3 ). I refer to my lecture notes [ 299 , 300 ] for a more detailed
exposition of this proof, which is reminiscent of a semi-classical
approach due to Ammari and Nier [ 14 , 15 , 16 ] .

#### 5.2.1. A finite dimensional quantitative version

The main content of [ 206 ] is a new proof of results originating in [
70 , 67 ] . It has also been found independently by Lieb and Solovej [
234 ] (for other purposes than the quantum de Finetti theorem), and yet
another proof appeared in [ 155 ] . Variants of the result have also
been considered [ 60 , 70 , 71 , 73 , 289 , 45 ] .

A question one might want to ask is whether ( 5.2.3 ) can be made
quantitative. The answer is known in the classical setting [ 104 , 156 ]
: it is possible to construct an explicit measure for which explicit
error estimates can be proven. Unfortunately, this construction cannot
be used in a quantum setting (it is based on empirical measures, a
purely classical concept). A quantum analogue of the Diaconis-Freedman
theorem is available only in the case where the one-body Hilbert space
is finite dimensional:

###### Theorem 5.2.1 (Quantitative quantum de Finetti theorem).

Let @xmath be a finite dimensional complex Hilbert space

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Let @xmath be a @xmath -body bosonic state and @xmath its reduced
density matrices. Let @xmath be the probability measure

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
                          (5.2.4)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath the Lebesgue measure on the unit sphere @xmath of @xmath .

Denoting

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

the associated state and @xmath its reduced density matrices, we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This implies in particular the bound

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for all @xmath .

A few comments:

-   As mentioned previously, the result is not new. The construction was
    first introduced in [ 70 ] , where a bound similar to ( 5.2.7 ) is
    derived. The explicit formula ( 5.2.6 ) originates in [ 67 ] . In [
    206 ] we re-derived the result using an analogy with well-known
    semi-classical ideas (coherent states, upper and lower symbols, cf [
    214 , 328 ] ) and the second-quantized formalism (the CCR algebra).

-   The error bound ( 5.2.7 ) easily follows from the explicit formula (
    5.2.6 ). The latter does come in handy in some cases, e.g. in the
    proof of some results of Chapter 6 below.

-   Note that the estimate ( 5.2.7 ) is interesting mostly when @xmath
    (think of @xmath as being fixed), i.e. when there are many more
    particles than available one-body states. It is rather intuitive
    that something special should happen in this case.

-   It is very satisfying that one has a simple explicit construction
    such as ( 5.2.1 ). The error bound we obtain can be shown to be
    (essentially) optimal with this construction, and it remains an open
    problem to see whether another one would improve the error.

-   However, the particular form of the approximate de Finetti measure
    used above is crucial in the proof of the results of Chapter 6 . In
    short, this has the form of a lower symbol in a coherent state
    basis, which allows to apply (variants of) the celebrated
    Berezin-Lieb inequalities [ 32 , 214 , 328 ] .

#### 5.2.2. The weak quantum de Finetti theorem

For infinite dimensional one-body Hilbert spaces such as @xmath , no
explicit error bound quantifying the precision of ( 5.2.3 ) is known at
present. One has to be content with formulating ( 5.2.3 ) as a limit
statement, or as an equality in the case of states having infinitely
many particles. This formulation is actually the original one [ 332 ,
162 ] . It provides useful information on the limit of @xmath -body
states only if one is able to pass to the strong @xmath - limit in
@xmath , where @xmath denotes the trace class. This requirement can turn
into a severe restriction in applications: if the system under
consideration is not confined, mass may be lost in the limit, and one
cannot hope for a strong limit.

To remedy this, we introduced and proved in [ 204 ] a so-called weak
quantum de Finetti theorem, which generalizes the original statement to
the case where one is able to pass to the weak- @xmath limit ² ² 2
Whence the name we coined. Beware that the weak theorem is actually
stronger than the usual version, refered to as “strong quantum de
Finetti” in [ 204 ] and subsequent papers. . Our proof is constructive,
reducing the infinite dimensional statement to the finite dimensional
case via “geometric localization” arguments as presented in [ 201 ] .

###### Theorem 5.2.2 (Weak quantum de Finetti).

Let @xmath be a complex separable Hilbert space and @xmath a sequence of
bosonic states with @xmath . We assume that for all @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

in @xmath . Then there exists a unique probability measure @xmath on the
unit ball @xmath of @xmath , invariant under the action of @xmath , such
that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.2.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for all @xmath .

A few comments:

-   The above essentially describes the generic case : given a sequence
    of @xmath -body states, one can always extract diagonal subsequences
    to ensure that ( 5.2.8 ) holds.

-   When the convergence in ( 5.2.8 ) is strong, the mass is conserved
    in the limit, and thus @xmath has to be concentrated on the unit
    sphere of @xmath . The converse is also true. Also, since @xmath
    does not depend on @xmath , we see that strong convergence for one
    particular @xmath implies convergence for all @xmath .

-   The constructive proof via geometric localization yields corollaries
    that turn useful when dealing with a mean-field problem with loss of
    mass at infinity.

-   Ammari and Nier have more general results [ 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 ] . In
    particular, it is not necessary to start from a state with a fixed
    particle number. One can consider a state on Fock space provided
    suitable bounds on its particle number (seen as a random variable in
    this framework) are available. See Chapter 6 below for a discussion
    of this situation.

### 5.3. Mean-field limits

We now turn to stating rigorous versions of the meta-Theorem 5.1.1 in
two cases where inter-particles interactions are frequent but weak. One
usually refers to this situation as the mean-field regime . Since every
particle interacts weakly with essentially all the others, one can hope
that correlations effects will average out. Then particles should behave
independently, and their interactions converge to a mean self-consistent
effect, because of the law of large numbers. The quantum de Finetti
theorem discussed above is the main tool we use to substantiate this
picture.

#### 5.3.1. Mean-field regime

The main focus in the paper [ 204 ] is the case where the one-body
potential @xmath is not trapping. Then, some particles can fly apart and
the issue is to prove that those which stay bound do form a
Bose-Einstein condensate. Note that there might be several clusters of
bound particles: those staying in the well of the one-body potential,
and those who are bound by the attractive part of the interaction
potential if it is strong enough. The proof of the following theorem
requires to show that all these clusters form BECs.

In this section we have to rely on several (concentration-)compactness
arguments. We can thus not deal with two limits at the same time and
take @xmath in ( 5.1.1 ). As for the external and interaction potentials
@xmath we make standard assumptions [ 284 , 285 ] ensuring
self-adjointness of the many-body Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath for @xmath and @xmath and decay at infinity. To state the
result, we denote

  -- -- -- ---------
           (5.3.2)
  -- -- -- ---------

the appropriate NLS functional, usually called Hartree functional in
this context where the interaction is non-local. To describe particles
escaping the potential wells, we also need the functional without
external fields:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The mass of minimizing sequences can be split into several clusters.
Accordingly, we denote

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

We may now state (a particular case of) the main result of [ 204 ] ,
where @xmath and the corresponding @xmath are defined as in Section 5.1
:

###### Theorem 5.3.1 (Derivation of Hartree’s theory in the mean-field
regime).

Under the preceding assumptions, we have:

@xmath Convergence of energy.

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

@xmath Convergence of states. Let @xmath be a sequence of @xmath
-normalized quasi-minimizers for @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and @xmath be the corresponding reduced density matrices. There exists
@xmath a probability measure on the unit ball of @xmath with @xmath ,
where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

such that, along a subsequence,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

weakly- @xmath in @xmath , for all @xmath .

@xmath If in addition the strict binding inequality

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

holds for all @xmath , the measure @xmath has its support in the sphere
@xmath and the limit ( 5.3.8 ) holds in trace-class norm. In particular,
if @xmath has a unique (modulo a constant phase) minimizer @xmath , then
for the whole sequence

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

for all fixed @xmath .

-   The main originality here is to deal with the case where mass is
    lost at infinity. When @xmath is trapping, similar results had been
    obtained previously [ 117 , 279 , 282 , 349 ] .

-   The measure appearing in the above is of course the de Finetti
    measure defined by Theorem 5.2.2 . The latter, together with its
    constructive proof and corollaries, is basically the only tool
    needed to prove Theorem 5.3.1 .

-   It is a classical fact that @xmath coincides with the set of weak
    limits of minimizing sequences for ( 5.3.2 ). This follows from the
    usual concentration-compactness method for non-linear one-body
    variational problems. Thus, the weak limits for the @xmath -body
    problem are fully characterized in terms of the weak limits for the
    one-body problem. Also, for large @xmath , the HVZ-like binding
    inequalities for the many-body problem reduce to binding
    inequalities for the Hartree functional.

-   It is certainly possible for the convergence in the above statement
    to be only weak- @xmath , which covers a certain physical reality.
    If the one-body potential is not attractive enough to retain all
    particles, we will typically have a scenario where

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    where @xmath is a critical mass that can be bound by the potential
    @xmath . In this case, @xmath will not be achieved if @xmath and one
    will have a minimizer for Hartree’s energy only for a mass @xmath .
    If for example the minimizer @xmath at mass @xmath is unique modulo
    a constant phase, the above result implies

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    and one should note that the limit has a mass @xmath . This scenario
    happens for example in the case of a “bosonic atom” [ 31 , 21 , 23 ,
    329 , 161 ] .

-   Note that, in actual experiments, one-body potentials that decay at
    infinity are always used to cool the gas below the critical
    temperature for BEC, by allowing the hotter atoms to escape the trap
    (evaporative cooling). Such a situation can be modeled by the above
    setting.

#### 5.3.2. Weak NLS regime

We next consider the case of small but positive @xmath in ( 5.1.1 ).
Then the effective interaction is short-range (a Dirac delta), although
the interaction range is much larger than the typical interparticle
distance. This is still a mean-field situation, but the fact that two
limits need to be dealt with at the same time adds some difficulties. In
particular, a quantitative argument is required: one cannot simply use
compactness arguments to pass to the limit. The estimates we rely on are
those of Theorem 5.2.1 . Since they are valid only in finite dimension
we need a way to project the many-body Hamiltonian and control the error
thus made. In [ 208 ] we project on the low-lying eigenstates of the
one-body Hamiltonian and control their number (which enters the error
in ( 5.2.7 )) via a semi-classical inequality à la Cwikel-Lieb-Rosenblum
(CLR) [ 94 , 217 , 292 ] . This method requires @xmath to be trapping,
but does not use any sophisticated estimate beyond Theorem 5.2.1 and the
CLR inequality. It is thus very general, and pays the price for this by
being limited to rather small @xmath , i.e. not too singular
interactions. We shall go beyond this limitation in Section 5.4 below.

We here deal with the case of trapped bosons, assuming that for some
constants @xmath

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In this case, the one-body Hamiltonian @xmath has a discrete spectrum on
which we have a good control thanks to Lieb-Thirring-like inequalities.
As for the vector potential @xmath , that can model a magnetic field or
Coriolis forces acting on rotating particles, it is sufficient to assume

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

A particularly relevant example is given by @xmath for @xmath and @xmath
for @xmath , corresponding to Coriolis forces due to a rotation at speed
@xmath around the @xmath -axis, or a constant magnetic field of strength
@xmath pointing in this direction.

Since @xmath becomes singular in the limit anyway, we make comfortable
assumptions on the unscaled potential @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We also assume that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which simplifies the replacement of @xmath by a Dirac mass to obtain the
limit functional

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and the associated ground state energy

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The latter being finite depends on the sign of the effective coupling
constant, which will in this section be taken as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In order for the limit problem to be well-defined, we need some
assumptions on @xmath . Indeed, if @xmath , the interaction is
attractive and it is not obvious that the quantum kinetic energy is
strong enough to stabilize the system. It in fact turns out that the
validity of the mean-field approximation demands slightly stronger
assumptions than those ensuring that ( 5.3.16 ) to be finite:

@xmath When @xmath , a ground state for ( 5.3.16 ) exists if and only if
@xmath . This is because the cubic non-linearity is super-critical ³ ³ 3
One may for example consult [ 176 , 337 ] for a classification of
non-linearities in the NLS equation. in this case: the interaction
energy dominates the quantum kinetic energy in stability issues. It is
moreover easy to see that @xmath if @xmath is negative at the origin.
The optimal assumption happens to be a classical stability notion for
the interaction potential:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This is satisfied as soon as @xmath , @xmath and @xmath with @xmath the
Fourier transform of @xmath . This assumption clearly implies @xmath ,
and one may easily see by changing scales that if it is violated for a
certain @xmath , then @xmath .

@xmath When @xmath , the cubic non-linearity is critical, i.e. it
competes with the quantum kinetic energy at the same order of magnitude.
A minimizer for ( 5.3.16 ) exists if and only if @xmath with

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the unique [ 185 ] (modulo translations) solution to

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The critical interaction parameter @xmath is the best possible constant
in the interpolation inequality

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

We refer to [ 148 , 255 ] for the existence of a ground state and to [
348 ] for the inequality ( 5.3.20 ). A pedagogical discussion may be
found in [ 127 ] .

In view of the above conditions, it is clear that in 2D we have to
assume @xmath , but this is in fact not sufficient: as in 3D, if the
interaction potential is sufficiently negative at the origin, one may
see that @xmath . The appropriate assumption is now

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

for all @xmath . Replacing @xmath by @xmath and taking the limit @xmath
shows that this implies

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If the strict inequality in ( 5.3.21 ) is reversed for a certain @xmath
, then @xmath . The case where equality may occur in ( 5.3.21 ) is left
aside here. It requires a more thorough analysis, see [ 148 ] where this
is provided at the level of the NLS functional.

@xmath When @xmath , the cubic non-linearity is sub-critical and there
always exists a NLS minimizer. In this case we need no further
assumption because the quantum kinetic energy always dominates the
interaction energy.

The following theorem is proved in [ 208 ] :

###### Theorem 5.3.2 (Weak NLS limit of the many-body problem).

Assume that either @xmath , or @xmath and ( 5.3.21 ) holds, or @xmath
and ( 5.3.17 ) holds. For @xmath further suppose that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the exponent appearing in ( 5.3.11 ). We then have

1.   Convergence of the energy:

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (5.3.23)
      -- -------- -- ----------

2.   Convergence of states: Let @xmath be a ground state of ( 5.1.1 )
    and @xmath its reduced density matrices. Along a subsequence we
    have, for all @xmath ,

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (5.3.24)
      -- -------- -- ----------

    strongly in @xmath . Here @xmath is a probability measure supported
    on

      -- -- -- ----------
               (5.3.25)
      -- -- -- ----------

    In particular, when ( 5.3.15 ) has a unique minimizer @xmath (up to
    a constant phase), we have for the whole sequence

      -- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath      (5.3.26)
      -- -------- -- ----------

-   Apart from the @xmath case (where there is no restriction), the
    assumption ( 5.3.22 ) we make on @xmath is rather strong. It can be
    improved a little bit, see the original paper for a discussion. In
    any case, the methods of [ 208 ] always require @xmath , i.e. a
    mean-field-like regime.

-   As previously mentioned, the assumptions on @xmath are close to
    optimal, thanks to the method of proof based on the quantum de
    Finetti theorem. In particular, the above result seems to be the
    first derivation of ground states with attractive interactions. This
    is particularly tricky in 2D, since such minimizers exist only for
    small enough values of the effective coupling constant.

### 5.4. Dilute limits

The next step of the program discussed in this chapter is to consider
dilute limits where interactions are rare but strong. In other words:
improve the range of @xmath obtained in Theorem 5.3.2 . This is very
important in practical applications: in the cold atoms context, the
emergence of BEC in interacting Bose gases has much more to do with
diluteness of the quantum gases under consideration than with the
weakness of the interactions.

The mathematical state of the art on this question, prior to the results
discussed below, is contained in a seminal series of papers by Lieb,
Seiringer and Yngvason [ 240 , 241 , 228 , 229 , 230 , 232 , 231 , 223 ,
224 , 317 ] , parts of which are reviewed in [ 227 , 318 , 359 ] . In
this approach, structural properties of the Hamiltonian play a key role
in the proofs. In particular, the interaction potential is required to
be positive. As we mentioned previously, in the dilute regime, delicate
estimates are required, and we cannot avoid relying on the structure of
the Hamiltonian to prove these. Nevertheless, the use of the quantum de
Finetti theorem simplifies a lot the proofs.

In the following we present two results, proved respectively in [ 267 ]
and [ 205 ] :

-   We first revisit the so-called Gross-Pitaevskii limit ( @xmath ) for
    the ground state of a trapped 3D Bose gas. Relying on the quantum de
    Finetti theorem and a new two-body estimate we simplify the
    Lieb-Seiringer-Yngvason approach of this problem. Interestingly, the
    new approach is rather insensitive to the presence of a gauge field
    @xmath , which is a considerable simplification. Indeed, improving
    the results of [ 228 ] to the case of non zero @xmath was a
    technical tour de force in [ 224 ] .

-   Next we discuss the case of the attractive 2D Bose gas. Using
    specific two-body estimates and a bootstrap argument, we can improve
    the range of @xmath available to @xmath with @xmath as in ( 5.3.11
    ). Note that [ 241 , 229 ] can go much further in the case of
    repulsive interactions. The novelty of [ 267 ] is thus to reach the
    dilute limit (it is always possible to take @xmath with this method)
    in the case of the attractive 2D Bose gas.

#### 5.4.1. 3D case, the Gross-Pitaevskii regime

In this section we start again from ( 5.1.1 ), with @xmath . The
one-body potential @xmath shall be trapping, but we do not need a
specific assumption on its growth at infinity:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.4.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

As for the gauge vector potential @xmath , only mild assumptions are
required:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.4.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for some constant @xmath . For simplicity, we assume that the
interaction potential @xmath is a fixed function which is non-negative,
radial and of finite range,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The main point in this section is that we shall take @xmath . This is
essentially the largest relevant value of @xmath in 3D, and the result
changes qualitatively in this regime, as we now explain.

For @xmath , the naive approximation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.4.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

does not capture the leading order behavior of the physical system. In
fact, strong correlations at short distances @xmath yield a nonlinear
correction, which essentially amounts to replacing the coupling constant
@xmath by @xmath the scattering length of @xmath , whose definition we
now recall (see [ 227 , Appendix C] ): Under our assumption on @xmath ,
the zero-energy scattering equation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

has a unique solution and it satisfies

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for some constant @xmath which is called the scattering length of @xmath
. In particular, if @xmath is the potential for hard spheres, namely
@xmath when @xmath and @xmath when @xmath , then the scattering length
of @xmath is exactly @xmath . In a dilute gas, the scattering length can
be interpreted as an effective range of the interaction: a quantum
particle far from the others is felt by them as a hard sphere of radius
@xmath . A useful variational characterization of @xmath is as follows:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.4.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Consequently, @xmath is smaller than @xmath . Moreover, a simple scaling
shows that the scattering length of @xmath is @xmath , so that the
scenario @xmath corresponds to fixing the scattering length of the
interaction potential, the so-called Gross-Pitaevskii limit. The limit
problem then consists in a NLS functional where the strength of the
interactions is set by the scattering length:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.4.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Note that this functional is not obtained by testing @xmath with
factorized states of the form @xmath . We shall denote

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.4.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

the Gross-Pitaevskii ground state energy.

###### Theorem 5.4.1 (Derivation of the Gross-Pitaevskii functional).

Under the above assumptions on @xmath and @xmath , we have, for @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.4.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Moreover, if @xmath is an approximate ground state for @xmath , namely

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

then there exists a Borel probability measure @xmath supported on the
set of minimizers of @xmath such that, along a subsequence,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.4.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

strongly in @xmath where @xmath is the @xmath -particle reduced density
matrix of @xmath . In particular, if @xmath subject to @xmath has a
unique minimizer @xmath (up to a complex phase), then there is complete
Bose-Einstein condensation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.4.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

As we mentioned previously, the result in itself is not new (only (
5.4.8 ) is for @xmath ): it was first proved in [ 228 ] in the case
where @xmath and then extended to non-zero @xmath in [ 224 ] . Both
proofs, in particular that for @xmath , are pretty difficult, and the
main contribution in [ 267 ] is to provide substantial simplifications.
We shall discuss only the energy lower bound and convergence of states
proofs, the energy upper bound being taken directly from [ 228 , 317 ] .

The main difficulty in dealing with the GP limit is that an ansatz
@xmath does not give the correct energy asymptotics. In this regime,
correlations between particles do matter, and one should rather think of
an ansatz of the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

or a close variant, where @xmath is linked to the two-body scattering
process. In the time-dependent literature, one may find different ways
of taking this most crucial fact into account, see [ 114 , 115 , 29 ,
280 ] . For the ground state problem we consider here, there seems to
exist only one approach, relying on an idea due to Dyson [ 106 ] ,
generalized several times as need arose [ 240 , 226 , 224 , 227 ] . The
trick is to bound the Hamiltonian from below by an effective one which
is much less singular (roughly, has a smaller @xmath ), but still
encodes the scattering length of the original interaction potential. The
philosophy is that if @xmath is the ground state of the original
Hamiltonian, then roughly

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath encodes the two-body scattering process and @xmath is a
ground state for the effective Dyson Hamiltonian.

The next task is then to justify the mean-field approximation for the
ground state @xmath of the Dyson Hamiltonian. There are two key
difficulties:

-   The effective Hamiltonian has a three-body interaction term.
    Obviously one has to show that it can be neglected, e.g. by showing
    that the probability of having three particles close by is small.

-   Although the Dyson Hamiltonian has a smaller @xmath than the
    original one, we still have to deal with the mean-field
    approximation in the “rare but strong collisions” limit if we are to
    be able to neglect three-body interactions. In other words, even
    though the effective Hamiltonian is much less singular than the
    original one, we do not have the freedom to reduce the singularity
    as much as we would like.

It is in treating these two difficulties that our new method
significantly departs from the previous works [ 208 , 224 ] . We shall
rely on a strong a priori estimate for ground states of the Dyson
Hamiltonian. Roughly speaking, we use the variational equation to prove
a bound of the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

independently of @xmath . This second moment estimate is the key point
in our analysis. It is reminiscent of similar estimates used in the
literature for the time-dependent problem [ 113 , 114 , 115 , 116 ] .
The use of Dyson’s lemma is crucial here: one should not expect ( 5.4.11
) to hold for the ground state of the original Hamiltonian.

We use ( 5.4.11 ) for two distinct purposes:

-   Control three-body contributions in the Dyson Hamiltonian, showing
    that they can safely be neglected. In [ 224 ] this was achieved by a
    complicated argument based on path integrals.

-   Improve the strategy of [ 208 ] (discussed in Section 5.3.2 ) to
    extend it to the “rare but strong collisions” regime. Indeed,
    although much less singular than the full model, the Dyson
    Hamiltonian still is in this regime. The two-body estimate ( 5.4.11
    ) gives a very strong control on the errors made by projecting the
    Dyson Hamiltonian onto low kinetic energy modes.

Finally, the use of the quantum de Finetti theorem as a basic building
block of the proof gives a simplified interpretation of the emergence of
the effective one-body energy. Moreover, it simplifies drastically the
convergence of states proof, which goes via a Feynman-Hellmann-type
argument. That is, by applying the whole strategy to an auxiliary
Hamiltonian with a smooth, small, @xmath -body say, perturbation and
ultimately taking the size of the perturbation to @xmath .

#### 5.4.2. 2D case, attractive interactions

As a last instance of Statement 5.1.1 , we consider the dilute limit for
2D particles with attractive interactions:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

As alluded to in Section 5.3.2 , this is the most delicate case in so
far as the interplay between quantum kinetic energy and pair
interactions is concerned. Indeed, for @xmath and @xmath , attractive
interactions generically lead to a collapse of the ground state, while
for @xmath , the system is stable for any interaction strength. In 2D,
the NLS functional is stable only for small enough values of the
coupling constant, which corresponds (beware the scaling of the coupling
constant in ( 5.1.1 )) to the existence of a critical mass for stability
of the many-body system. This mass-critical scenario at the level of the
ground state has a natural extension to the dynamical problem, where
global existence versus finite time blow-up are strongly conditioned by
the mass of the initial datum (see [ 176 , 337 ] and references
therein).

As in Section 5.3.2 , our results depend on the growth at infinity of
the one-body potential @xmath . We assume that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

To have a stable system we make an almost optimal assumption on the
interactions potential, similarly as in Section 5.3.2 :

  -- -- -- ----------
           (5.4.13)
  -- -- -- ----------

It is easy to see that this implies @xmath with @xmath the critical
coupling constant ( 5.3.18 ) for existence of a NLS ground state. Thus
the ground state energy

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

is well-defined, where

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

A simple condition implying ( 5.4.13 ) is @xmath .

The results of [ 208 ] allow to derive the above limit problem when
@xmath , provided

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In [ 205 ] we extend this range to

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This is a qualitative improvement: while @xmath , we have @xmath . We
can thus treat a dilute limit where interactions are rare but strong:

###### Theorem 5.4.2 (Attractive dilute 2D Bose gases).

Assume that @xmath , @xmath , @xmath satisfy the above. Then, for every
@xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Moreover, for any ground state @xmath of @xmath , there exists a Borel
probability measure @xmath supported on the ground states of @xmath such
that, along a subsequence,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

If @xmath has a unique minimizer @xmath (up to a phase), then for the
whole sequence

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.4.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

-   The estimates leading to the above result answer a question raised
    by Xuwen Chen and Justin Holmer in their derivation of focusing
    time-dependent NLS equations [ 65 , 64 ] . In the case of the
    harmonic trap @xmath , one can combine their BBGKY-type ⁴ ⁴ 4 That
    is, based on the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchy of
    evolution equations for reduced density matrices. approach and the
    results of [ 205 ] to derive the time-dependent 2D focusing NLS
    equation in the regime @xmath . If @xmath , the next order
    correction to the 2D focusing quantum dynamics can be obtained using
    the Bogoliubov approach [ 209 , 266 , 265 ] (see [ 37 ] for the
    defocusing case).

-   The basic strategy of proof is the same as in [ 208 ] , see Section
    5.3.2 : projection onto low-lying energy eigenstates of the one-body
    Hamiltonian and use of the finite dimensional quantum de Finetti
    theorem 5.2.1 .

-   The main novelty allowing to reach larger values of @xmath is the
    use of a priori moments estimates having the same flavor as ( 5.4.11
    ). Roughly speaking, the variational equation for ground states of (
    5.1.1 ) implies

      -- -------- -------- -- ----------
         @xmath   @xmath      
         @xmath   @xmath      (5.4.20)
      -- -------- -------- -- ----------

-   Note that the above estimates are not truly a priori bounds since
    they involve the many-body ground-state energy @xmath in the
    right-hand side. The ideal case would be to know stability of the
    second kind: @xmath . Of course, this is far from obvious: it should
    be the conclusion and not the premise. To put ( 5.4.2 ) to good use,
    the starting point is an energy lower bound obtained in [ 200 ] by
    the operator methods alluded to in Section 5.1 . This yields
    stability of the second kind for the mean-field regime @xmath and
    may be combined with ( 5.4.2 ) and the quantum de Finetti theorem in
    an induction procedure leading to stability for @xmath .

## Chapter 6 Bosonic thermal states and non-linear Gibbs measures

We now move one step further in the description of large bosonic systems
by considering equilibrium states at positive temperature, with the
upshot of gaining a better understanding of the BEC phase transition.
Here we present joint results with M. Lewin and P.T. Nam [ 207 ] ,
following mainly the expository note [ 203 ] . We refer to [ 301 ] for
another look at the main results of [ 207 ] , with an emphasis on their
relation to constructive quantum field theory [ 102 , 138 , 247 , 327 ,
335 , 343 ] and the use of invariant measures in the study of non-linear
dispersive partial differential equations [ 196 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 ,
341 , 48 , 47 , 338 , 49 ] .

Recall that full Bose-Einstein condensation is the phenomenon that,
below a certain critical temperature @xmath , (almost) all particles of
a bosonic system must reside in a single quantum state of low energy.
Ideally one would like to prove the existence of such a temperature and
provide an estimate thereof. For an interacting gas this has so far
remained out of reach. In particular, for the homogeneous Bose gas,
there is still no proof of Bose-Einstein condensation in the
thermodynamic limit, even in the ground state. However, this might not
be the main question of interest for the description of cold atoms
experiments. Indeed, those are performed in magneto-optic traps, which
set a fixed length scale to the problem. The gases in which BEC is
observed are thus not homogeneous, and the thermodynamic limit is not
the most physically relevant regime in this context.

A lot of progress has been achieved in recent years by considering
different scaling regimes, more adapted to the case of inhomogeneous
systems, e.g. the mean-field and the Gross-Pitaevskii limits. For
trapped systems, BEC in the ground state and its propagation by the
many-body Schrödinger dynamics is now fairly well understood (see [ 30 ,
141 , 200 , 227 , 299 , 300 , 315 , 318 ] and Chapter 5 for reviews).
Even in these somewhat more wieldy regimes, very little is known about
positive temperature equilibrium states. In particular, an estimate of
the critical temperature (or, more generally, temperature regime) is
lacking.

In this chapter, we discuss some of our recent results [ 207 ] , in the
perspective of the previously mentioned issues. The main idea is to
relate, in a certain limit, Gibbs states of large bosonic systems to
non-linear Gibbs measures built on the associated mean-field
functionals. This is a semi-classical method, where the BEC phenomenon
can be recast in the context of a classical field theory. Although, as
far as the study of BEC is concerned, our results are rather partial, it
is our hope that our methods might in the future help to shed some light
on the physics we just discussed.

### 6.1. The grand-canonical ensemble

We consider @xmath bosons living in @xmath and work in the
grand-canonical ensemble. Let thus @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

be the symmetric @xmath -fold tensor product appropriate for bosons and

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

be the bosonic Fock space. We are interested in the positive temperature
equilibrium states of the second-quantized Hamiltonian @xmath defined as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with ¹ ¹ 1 We do not consider a gauge field in this discussion. This is
for simplicity only, cf the original paper.

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

Here @xmath is a chemical potential, @xmath is a trapping potential,
i.e.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and @xmath is a positive , symmetric, self-adjoint operator on @xmath .
The methods of [ 207 ] are limited to rather smooth repulsive
interactions, thus @xmath will in general not be a multiplication
operator. We shall comment on this issue below but, for the time being,
think of a finite-rank @xmath with smooth eigenvectors, corresponding to
a regularization of a physical interaction.

We are interested in the asymptotic behavior of the grand-canonical
Gibbs state at temperature @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The partition function @xmath fixes the trace equal to @xmath and
satisfies

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the infimum of the free energy functional

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

over all grand-canonical states (trace-class self-adjoint operators on
@xmath with trace @xmath ). It turns out that an interesting limiting
behavior emerges in the regime

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

provided one makes the following assumptions:

###### Assumption 6.1.1 (One-body hamiltonian).

We assume that, as an operator on @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and that there exists @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Note that one can always find a @xmath such that ( 6.1.5 ) holds. The
easiest case, for which our results are the most satisfying, is that
where one can take @xmath (refered to as the trace-class case). This
happens only in 1D and if the trapping potential grows sufficiently fast
at infinity, i.e.

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath small enough and @xmath .

###### Assumption 6.1.2 (Interaction term).

We pick @xmath a positive self-adjoint operator on @xmath and
distinguish two cases:

-    either one can take @xmath in ( 6.1.5 ) and then we assume

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (6.1.7)
      -- -------- -- ---------

-    or @xmath in ( 6.1.5 ) and we make the stronger assumption that

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (6.1.8)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    for some @xmath .

In essence, these (rather restrictive) assumptions correspond to asking
that the non-interacting Gibbs state has a well-controlled interaction
energy. Indeed, one can compute that its two-body density matrix behaves
as @xmath in the limit @xmath . In the 1D case ( 6.1.6 ) where @xmath ,
we can take for example @xmath a multiplication operator, e.g. by a
bounded function @xmath . The assumption we make when @xmath does not
cover such operators.

### 6.2. Non-linear Gibbs measures

The natural limiting object in the setting we just described turns out
to be the non-linear Gibbs measure on one-body quantum states given
formally by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a partition function and @xmath is the mean-field energy
functional

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The rigorous meaning of ( 6.2.1 ) is given by the two following standard
lemmas/definitions:

###### Lemma 6.2.1 (Free Gibbs measure).

Write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and define the associated scale of Sobolev-like spaces

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Define a finite dimensional measure on @xmath by setting

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath and @xmath are the real and imaginary parts of the scalar
product.

Let @xmath be such that ( 6.1.5 ) holds. Then there exists a unique
measure @xmath over the space @xmath such that, for all @xmath , the
above finite dimensional measure @xmath is the cylindrical projection of
@xmath on @xmath . Moreover

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where this is seen as an operator acting on @xmath .

Note that the free Gibbs measure never lives on the energy space @xmath
. It lives on the original Hilbert space @xmath if and only if ( 6.1.5 )
holds with @xmath . We can now define the interacting Gibbs measure as
being absolutely continuous with respect to the free Gibbs measure:

###### Lemma 6.2.2 (Interacting Gibbs measure).

Let

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

If Assumptions 6.1.2 hold we have that @xmath is in @xmath . In
particular

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

makes sense as a probability measure over @xmath . That is, the relative
partition function satisfies

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Equation ( 6.2.5 ) is the correct interpretation of the formal
definition ( 6.2.1 ). It is this object that we derive from the bosonic
grand-canonical Gibbs state.

### 6.3. Mean-field/small temperature regime

Our main result in [ 207 ] relates, in the limit ( 6.1.4 ), the
grand-canonical Gibbs state ( 6.1.1 ) to the classical Gibbs measure on
one-body states defined in Lemma 6.2.2 . It is useful to recall the
notion of @xmath -particle reduced density matrix for states over @xmath
. For a “diagonal” state of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

this is the operator @xmath on the @xmath -particles space @xmath
defined by ² ² 2 The partial trace is taken over the symmetric space
only.

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for every bounded operator @xmath on @xmath . These are helpful for
rewriting expressions involving only @xmath -particle operators. Remark
that the normalization convention taken here differs from that of
Chapter 5 : if @xmath is a @xmath -body state, @xmath has trace @xmath .

###### Theorem 6.3.1 (Derivation of nonlinear Gibbs measures).

Under Assumptions 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the infimum of the free-energy functional ( 6.1.3 ) and
@xmath the relative partition function defined in Lemma 6.2.2 .

Let furthermore @xmath be the reduced @xmath -body density matrix of
@xmath . We have,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

strongly in the Schatten space @xmath . In case @xmath in ( 6.1.5 ) we
also have, for any @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

strongly in the trace-class.

An obvious caveat of our approach is the case @xmath where the result is
not as strong as one would hope. We conjecture that ( 6.3.3 ) continues
to hold strongly in the Schatten space @xmath also for @xmath , but this
remains an open problem. More importantly, it would be highly desirable
to go beyond the stringent assumption ( 6.1.8 ). There are however
well-known obstructions to the construction of the Gibbs measure @xmath
in this case. A minima, a Wick renormalization [ 102 , 138 , 327 ] must
be performed in order to make sense of the measure when @xmath is a
multiplication operator. The quantum Gibbs state one starts the analysis
from should also be modified accordingly. We refer to [ 133 ] for recent
results in this direction.

Let us comment on the relevance of this result to the BEC phenomenon:

-   First, this theorem seems to be the first giving detailed
    information on the limit of the thermal states of a Bose system at
    relatively large temperature. The result ( 6.3.2 ) clearly shows the
    absence of full BEC in the regime we consider. For finite
    dimensional bosons, things simplify a lot and versions of Theorem
    6.3.1 were known before, see [ 144 , 143 , 168 ] , [ 183 , Chapter
    3] , and [ 299 , Appendix B] .

-   The asymptotic regime ( 6.1.4 ) should be thought of as a mean-field
    limit. In fact, when @xmath , ( 6.3.2 ) indicates that the expected
    particle number behaves as @xmath , so that taking @xmath
    corresponds to the usual mean-field scaling where the coupling
    constant scales as the inverse of the particle number. Roughly
    speaking we are thus dealing with the regime

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

-   Still in the case @xmath , one should expect from a natural
    extrapolation of this theorem that full BEC does occur in the regime

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    which would indicate that the critical temperature scales in this
    case as the particle number. A natural idea would be to confirm this
    by studying the concentration of the non-linear Gibbs measure @xmath
    on the mean-field minimizer when the chemical potential is varied.

-   A comparison with the case of particles with no quantum statistics
    (boltzons) is instructive, see [ 203 ] for details. First, the
    emergence of the non-linear Gibbs measure truly requires Bose
    statistics. Next, for trapped boltzons, the critical temperature for
    BEC scales as @xmath when @xmath in the mean-field regime. Only when
    @xmath at the same time as @xmath does full BEC occur in the Gibbs
    state. One should expect that the critical temperature is much
    higher for bosons than for boltzons. This can be seen from comparing
    the above theorem and [ 336 , 204 , Section 3.2] : @xmath in the
    mean-field limit whereas @xmath . In fact, Theorem 6.3.1 suggests
    that in some situations the critical temperature for bosons can be
    as high as @xmath .

### 6.4. Berezin-Lieb inequality for relative entropies

The proof of Theorem 6.3.1 is lengthy and shall not be reviewed here. We
however discuss its main conceptual building blocks, restricting to the
trace-class case @xmath . First, as one easily realizes, @xmath
minimizes the relative free-energy functional (the second term is a von
Neumann relative entropy)

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (6.4.1)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

whose minimum is @xmath . It is crucial to work directly on that
difference, characterizing it as the minimum of some functional. We
expect that both terms taken individually diverge very fast.

On the other hand, @xmath is the infimum of some variational problem of
which @xmath is the solution: @xmath minimizes

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (6.4.2)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

amongst all @xmath -absolutely continuous measures @xmath on the
one-body Hilbert space @xmath . The second term is the classical
relative entropy of @xmath relative to @xmath .

The above observations make the semi-classical nature of Theorem 6.3.1
apparent. We have to relate the minimization problems for the quantum
and classical free-energy functionals ( 6.4 ) and ( 6.4 ). In order to
describe quantum objects, operators on a Hilbert space, in terms of
classical objects, probability measures, we rely on quantum de Finetti
theorems again, as discussed in Section 5.2 . This time we need
Fock-space versions thereof. In the trace-class case, the following
result of [ 15 ] is sufficient:

###### Theorem 6.4.1 (Grand-canonical quantum de Finetti theorem).

Let @xmath be a sequence of states on the Fock space @xmath . Assume
that there exists a sequence @xmath such that, for all @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.4.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Then, there exists a unique Borel probability measure @xmath on @xmath
such that, along a subsequence,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.4.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

weakly in the trace-class for every integer @xmath .

Some comments:

-   To deal with the non-trace-class case @xmath , some improvements are
    necessary, provided in [ 207 ] , but we shall not discuss this here.

-   The case @xmath of Theorem 6.3.1 could be rephrased as saying that
    the de Finetti measure of the sequence @xmath is the nonlinear Gibbs
    measure @xmath .

-   Here @xmath should be thought of as a semiclassical parameter
    essentially forcing the particle number to behave as @xmath . To
    apply this result in our context, we need to check that ( 6.4.3 )
    holds, with @xmath and @xmath . In the trace-class case, this is not
    too difficult because the particle number is well under control.

-   Since we have convergence of density matrices, a lower bound to the
    interaction energy term in ( 6.4 ) follows from this theorem.

In view of the last point, the main remaining task is to estimate the
relative entropy term in ( 6.4 ). One should keep the following in mind:

-   Contrarily to the energy, it is not expressed in terms of reduced
    density matrices only. It genuinely depends of the full state.

-   One should not “undo” the relative entropy to consider only the von
    Neumann entropies of @xmath and @xmath directly, since we do not
    expect a good control on those.

Well-known tools to link quantum entropy terms to their semiclassical
counterparts are the so-called Berezin-Lieb inequalities [ 32 , 214 ,
328 ] . Since we work in infinite dimensions and we cannot undo the
relative entropy to rely on known inequalities, we need the following
new result:

###### Theorem 6.4.2 (Berezin-Lieb inequality for the relative entropy).

Let @xmath and @xmath , @xmath be two sequences of states satisfying the
assumptions of Theorem 6.4.1 . Let @xmath and @xmath be their de Finetti
measures. Then

  -- -- -- ---------
           (6.4.5)
  -- -- -- ---------

Some comments:

-   Clearly, this will give the desired lower bound to the relative
    entropy term in ( 6.4 ) if we can prove first that the de Finetti
    measure of the free Gibbs state @xmath is given by @xmath . Since
    all the density matrices of @xmath can be explicitly computed, this
    is easily shown by direct inspection.

-   For the proof of this result, we rely heavily on a constructive
    approach to Theorem 6.4.1 , reminiscent of the proof of Theorem
    5.2.2 we discussed previously. The precise way one can approach the
    measure by explicit functions of the states, as in ( 5.2.1 ), is
    crucial.

-   The link with semi-classics proceeds by seeing the de Finetti
    measure both as a lower symbol/covariant symbol/Husimi
    function/anti-Wick quantization and as an approximate upper
    symbol/contravariant symbol/Wigner measure/Wick quantization based
    on a coherent state decomposition.

-   We also rely on deep properties of the quantum relative entropy:
    joint convexity and monotonicity under two-positive trace preserving
    maps [ 347 , 270 , 56 ] . These are in fact equivalent to the strong
    subadditivity of the quantum entropy, a crucial property proved by
    Lieb and Ruskai [ 221 , 222 ] .

## Chapter 7 Emergent fractional statistics

Traditionally, for sound experimental and theoretical reasons, quantum
particles are divided into two classes: bosons and fermions. The
many-body wave-function of a system of bosons is symmetric under
particle exchange, while that of a system of fermions is anti-symmetric.
This implies fundamental differences in their behavior: fermions satisfy
the Pauli exclusion principle (at most one particle per quantum state),
bosons do not. Consequently, fermionic bulk matter is stable, while
bosonic bulk matter is not [ 110 , 111 , 215 , 225 ] . Free bosons in
thermal equilibrium distribute in single-particle quantum states
following the Bose-Einstein statistics, while free fermions follow the
Fermi-Dirac statistics. Bosons condense into a single one-particle state
(see Chapters 5 - 6 and references therein) while fermions form a Fermi
sea. Some fundamental inequalities such as the Lieb-Thirring kinetic
energy lower bound hold only for fermions [ 235 , 236 , 225 ] .
Cherished physical principles, such as the classification of elements in
the Mendeleev periodic table, are valid because electrons are fermions.
Others, such as the possibility of creating a laser, are valid because
photons are bosons.

In this chapter we discuss some contributions to the theory of anyons ,
that is, of particles that do not fit in the bosons/fermions dichotomy.
The very possibility that such exotic objects could exist should be seen
as a daring hypothesis. We shall thus first start by a quick
introduction to the anyons concept in Section 7.1 , making no claim of
originality (see [ 132 , 198 , 356 , 164 , 123 , 264 , 172 , 273 ] for
general references). In brief, we shall recall that anyons can exist
only in low spatial dimensions, 1D or 2D, so that they can only be
quasi- or dressed particles of constrained systems. Next, in Section 7.2
we summarize the findings of [ 250 ] where we vindicate ¹ ¹ 1 Without a
mathematical proof, but what we think is a sounder physical proof than
what has appeared in the literature so far. the general belief [ 20 ,
189 , 167 ] that some quasi-particles arising in fractional quantum Hall
physics indeed behave as anyons. Finally, in Section 7.3 we summarize [
249 ] , giving modest elements of answer to the question “Suppose one
manages to create anyons in the lab, how can one probe their physics ?”
As we shall explain, appropriate effective models are necessary to
answer that question, and we focus on the derivation of one such model
from first principles.

### 7.1. The concept of 2D anyons

There does not seem to be a universal way of building a quantum theory,
starting from a reasonable classical one. The possibility for exotic
particle statistics has staid hidden in implicit quantization choices
for years, until those were recognized as true choices instead of
obvious necessities [ 136 , 140 , 197 , 330 , 331 , 354 , 355 ] . To
appreciate this, we shall first review the usual theoretical argument
supporting the bosons/fermions dichotomy.

#### 7.1.1. Bosons and fermions

Let us consider @xmath quantum particles living in the physical space
@xmath . The classical configuration space is @xmath and one describes
the quantum system with a complex-valued wave-function @xmath . Since
@xmath is interpreted as the direct-space probability density of the
system, and @xmath as the momentum-space probability density ² ² 2 With
the convention that the Fourier transform is a @xmath isometry. , we
have to impose

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

but this is not the only physical constraint. Indeed, actual particles
are indistinguishable , so that the labeling of coordinates @xmath is
arbitrary. Thus, one should obviously demand that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for any permutation @xmath of @xmath indices, where @xmath is the
unitary operator that permutes particle labels:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It is sometimes improperly claimed that ( 7.1.1 ) implies that @xmath is
either symmetric or anti-symmetric. There are counter-examples [ 136 ] ,
but one should realize that indistinguishability is a stronger concept
than ( 7.1.1 ). In quantum mechanics, every possible measurement on a
system is represented by a self-adjoint operator @xmath on @xmath . The
expected value of the quantity represented by @xmath , when measured in
the state @xmath , is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus one should demand that any such value does not depend on the
labeling of the particles, and the bosons/fermions dichotomy comes about
via the following elementary lemma:

###### Lemma 7.1.1 (Bosons and fermions).

Let @xmath with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

satisfy, for any bounded self-adjoint operator @xmath on @xmath and any
permutation @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Then either

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

or

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

###### Proof.

Take @xmath . According to ( 7.1.2 ), we must have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for all @xmath and hence

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for some complex number @xmath with modulus one. For consistency we see
that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

must hold for all @xmath . The map @xmath is a thus one-dimensional
representation of the permutation group and it follows that either
@xmath or @xmath ∎

Of course, this argument is mostly academic: that all known particles
behave as either bosons and fermions is quite simply an experimental
fact. But in view of the above, there seems to be little to no room,
even in theory, for other possibilities. One could then claim that the
dichotomy is a fundamental fact of nature. That is, provided one trusts
the (elementary) quantization procedure just described, which, in
hindsight, is more subtle than it looks.

#### 7.1.2. Anyons

The breakthrough leading to the introduction of anyons occurred in [ 197
] where it was realized

-   that there is one choice implicitly made in the above quantization
    procedure,

-   that a different quantization can lead to different particle
    statistics,

-   that these can occur only in low dimensions @xmath .

A parallel approach is that of [ 354 , 355 ] where it is argued that in
low dimensions the spin needs not be quantized. Hence, via the
spin-statistics theorem, one may hope for exotic particle statistics. We
shall not describe this approach here ³ ³ 3 The spin-statistics theorem
is a result of relativistic quantum field theory. One can prefer not
having to use it to discuss ordinary non-relativistic matter. , nor that
of [ 140 ] , and now turn to a (very crude) summary of the findings of [
197 ] .

In fact, the only choice made in the above quantization procedure that
is not a basic axiom of quantum mechanics, and that is not obviously
logically necessary, is that we have first quantized, then symmetrized .
Namely, we have first introduced wave-functions, and then restricted
possible choices thereof by a physical symmetry postulate. What happens
if we instead first symmetrize, then quantize ?

We shall not enter into the mathematical description of this process,
but state the essential conclusions, restricting ⁴ ⁴ 4 There is an
ambiguity in 1D, in that one cannot continuously exchange particles on a
line without making them collide. to @xmath :

-   In dimension @xmath , the former conclusion remains valid, only
    bosonic and fermionic wave-functions are logically consistent
    possibilities.

-   For @xmath , there is a whole continuum of other possible choices,
    labeled by a real number @xmath . Bosons correspond to @xmath ,
    fermions to @xmath

This difference is of topological origin: one removes particles
encounters points from the configuration space, because they are
somewhat singular. A given particle then moves in a punctured space. The
punctured 3D space is simply connected, while the punctured 2D space is
not. In 3D and higher, the first homotopy group of the classical
configuration space is the permutation group, in 2D it is the braid
group. The latter has a continuum of one-dimensional representations,
and this is where the continuum of possible statistics originates from [
357 , 358 ] .

In short, in 2D there is no inconsistency in demanding that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a real number that can be restricted to @xmath by
periodicity. One refers to @xmath as the statistics parameter, and
speaks of fractional statistics ⁵ ⁵ 5 Although, strictly speaking,
irrational @xmath is also allowed. if @xmath , that is when we deal with
particles that behave neither as bosons nor as fermions. The term anyons
(“any”-ons) was coined by Wilczek [ 355 ] because the statistics
parameter can a priori be any number.

Of course the above object cannot be a function, for it would be
multi-valued ⁶ ⁶ 6 Think of permuting a pair of indices twice; the
function then picks a phase @xmath . unless @xmath (bosons) or @xmath
(fermions). It should in fact be seen as a fiber bundle, which would
complicate any theoretical description and mathematical analysis.
Fortunately, there is a natural, albeit formal, way to fall back on the
familiar description in terms of wave-functions. We present this next.

#### 7.1.3. Magnetic gauge picture

In the sequel we shall be interested in the quantum mechanics of
non-relativistic 2D particles obeying fractional statistics. This means
that we are interested in acting on “functions” satisfying ( 7.1.5 )
with a many-body Hamiltonian of the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the usual momentum operator for particle @xmath , @xmath
is the vector potential of an external gauge field, @xmath a one-body
potential and @xmath a pair interaction potential. The usual way to
render this problem more tractable is to write

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the angle of the vector @xmath in the plane. That way,
@xmath has, at least formally, bosonic symmetry (its @xmath is @xmath
modulo @xmath ) and one might prefer to describe the system in terms of
it. The important observation is that acting on @xmath with @xmath is
formally equivalent to acting on @xmath with a new, effective
Hamiltonian:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The effective gauge vector potential is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and it depends on the position of the particles. The associated magnetic
field is a sum of delta functions

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.1.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

One can thus see non-relativistic anyons as ordinary bosons that carry
in addition fictitious Aharonov-Bohm-like flux tubes whose vector
potential influences the other particles. Of course one could choose a
convention where @xmath is fermionic instead, with obvious modifications
to the above equations. One could even (although this does not seem a
very good idea) describe 2D fermions as bosons coupled to flux tubes,
and vice-versa.

The above formalism based on ( 7.1.7 ) and ( 7.1.8 ) is called “magnetic
gauge picture” by opposition to the “anyon gauge picture” based on (
7.1.5 ) and ( 7.1.6 ). The obvious advantage is that we can now think in
terms of bosonic (or fermionic) wave-functions. The obvious drawback is
that the anyon Hamiltonian is pretty complicated. Even in the free case
@xmath , very few exact results on the spectrum or dynamics of @xmath
are known. Well-educated approximations are thus highly desirable, even
more so than for usual interacting bosons and fermions (the effective
magnetic interaction contained in ( 7.1.8 ) is considerably more
intricate than a simple pair interaction). Section 7.3 below is
concerned with this issue. Before entering this question, we discuss the
emergence of fractional statistics for a certain type of quasi-particles
in Section 7.2 . Interestingly, we shall see that it is the magnetic
gauge picture, and not the anyon gauge picture, that naturally emerges.
For all practical purposes relevant to this memoir we thus can, and
shall, consider only the former description. Anyons are thus identified
in the sequel as ordinary bosons or fermions feeling an effective
Hamiltonian of the form ( 7.1.8 )

### 7.2. Anyons in quantum Hall physics

That fractional statistics can occur only in low dimensions seems a
no-go for their relevance to fundamental particles. All of these
(electrons, photons, quarks …) are 3D objects. Even if restricted to
lower dimensions in the lab, they retain their 3D statistics, which can
only be bosonic or fermionic. The statistics of composite objects, such
as protons, neutrons and atoms, are obtained by adding the statistics of
their constituents: this can only produce bosons or fermions.

Anyons can thus only exist as quasi-particles of low dimensional
systems. In this section we discuss the emergence of 2D fractional
statistics for the most prominent candidates that seem to have been
considered in the literature so far: quasi-holes of the Laughlin state.
We have already studied the Laughlin wave-function in some detail in
Chapter 3 . Here we shall be interested in some of its elementary
excitations, called quasi-holes. We argue that, when coupled to tracer
particles, they effectively change the statistics of the latter. The
tracer particles, dressed by the quasi-holes of the Laughlin
wave-function, become anyons with statistics parameter

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the exponent in the Laughlin wave-function ( 3.1.3 ) and
@xmath the original statistics parameter of the tracer particles (thus
@xmath or @xmath , bosons or fermions). The possibility of creating
anyons in the fractional quantum Hall effect context seems to be widely
accepted [ 137 , 139 , 333 , 189 , 167 ] . It has recently been proposed
[ 77 , 36 , 263 , 276 , 291 , 345 ] that this physics could be emulated
in ultra-cold atomic gases subjected to artificial magnetic fields. It
is such a system we have in mind primarily, although the following might
still be of relevance to the usual 2D electrons gases where the FQHE is
observed.

Warning. The reader should be aware that the results of this section are
not mathematically rigorous, contrarily to everything discussed in this
memoir so far. They are included because

-   their authors (this is joint work with Douglas Lundholm [ 250 ] )
    have good hope to render them rigorous, at least in parts, in the
    near future;

-   they avoid some issues with the usual arguments in favor of
    fractional statistics;

-   they give a physical motivation to the rigorous results of Section
    7.3 below, and to future investigations.

#### 7.2.1. Tracer particles in a Laughlin liquid

Consider the following thought experiment: two different species of 2D
particles interact repulsively among themselves, and couple to a uniform
magnetic field. Such a set-up has already been suggested [ 78 , 360 ,
361 ] as a way to probe the emergence of fractional statistics, using
cold atomic gases.

The Hilbert space for the joint system is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the number of particles of the first type and @xmath the
number of particles of the second type. For definiteness we assume that
the two types of particles be bosons, whence the imposed symmetry in the
above Hilbert spaces. The following however applies to any choice of
statistics for both types of particles.

We write the Hamiltonian for the full system as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is the Hamiltonian for the first type of particles and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

that for the second type of particles. We shall denote @xmath and @xmath
the coordinates of the two types of particles and choose units so that
@xmath , and the mass and charge of the second type of particles are
respectively @xmath and @xmath . We keep the freedom that the first type
of particles might have a different mass @xmath and a different charge
@xmath . The first type of particles should be thought of as tracers
immersed in a large sea of the second type. We shall accordingly use the
terms “tracer particles” and “bath particles” in the sequel.

We have also introduced:

-   the usual momenta @xmath and @xmath .

-   a uniform magnetic field of strength @xmath . Our convention is that
    it points downwards:

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

-   intra-species interaction potentials, @xmath and @xmath . We think
    of short-range potentials for simplicity.

-   an inter-species interaction potential @xmath . Again, @xmath should
    be thought of as being short-range.

The next step is to assume a strong hierarchy of energy scales. The
requirements are rather stringent, but we think they are ultimately
necessary for the emergence of fractional statistics. We assume that the
energy scales of the problem are set, in order of decreasing
importance/magnitude, by

1.  the external magnetic field @xmath , which forces all bath particles
    to occupy lowest Landau levels orbitals. Note that the splitting
    between Landau levels for the tracer particles is rather
    proportional to @xmath so if @xmath it is reasonable to allow that
    they occupy several Landau levels.

2.  the interaction potential @xmath , which forces the joint
    wave-function of the system to vanish when two bath particles
    encounter.

3.  the interaction potential @xmath , which forces the joint
    wave-function of the system to vanish when a bath and a tracer
    particles encounter.

4.  all the rest, which, as we will argue, essentially boils down to an
    effective energy for the tracer particles.

This leads us to a reasonable ansatz for the joint wave-function of the
system:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath describes a Laughlin state of the @xmath bath particles,
coupled to @xmath quasi-holes at the locations of the tracer particles:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We have here identified @xmath and @xmath . We choose @xmath to enforce

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for any @xmath . We thus ensure normalization of the full wave function
@xmath by demanding that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In ( 7.2.5 ), @xmath and @xmath are two positive integers. The latter
should be even for symmetry reasons (it would be odd if the bath
particles were fermions).

#### 7.2.2. Derivation of the magnetic gauge Hamiltonian

The wave-function @xmath describing the tracer particles is the only
variable part left. One thus wants to choose it properly in order to
approximate the ground state of the full system. Our main claim is that
this can be achieved by taking @xmath as the ground state of some
effective Hamiltonian:

###### Statement 7.2.1 (Emergence of fractional statistics).

We make the previous assumptions on the energy scales of the problem. In
addition we suppose that @xmath and that @xmath contains a hard-core of
radius larger than @xmath . Then we claim the following:

1.   An ansatz of the form ( 7.2.4 ) is a good approximation for the
    ground state of the full system.

2.   The full ground state energy satisfies

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (7.2.7)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    where

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (7.2.8)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    @xmath being defined as in ( 7.1.9 ).

3.   Consequently, the optimal choice for @xmath is a ground state of
    @xmath and we have

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (7.2.9)
      -- -------- -- ---------

A few comments are in order, keeping in mind that this statement is not
a rigorous theorem:

-   We are lead to conjecture that all the physics boils down to the
    motion of the tracer particles. These are dressed by holes in the
    density of bath particles and thus become quasi-particles whose
    physics is determined by an emergent Hamiltonian.

-   A first remarkable fact about @xmath is that the charge of the
    tracer particles gets reduced: @xmath in the coupling to the
    external magnetic field. This comes about because Laughlin
    quasi-holes carry a fraction of an electron’s charge [ 187 , 188 ] .
    This is a well documented fact, including experimentally [ 310 , 101
    , 256 ] .

-   That the Laughlin quasi-holes have fractional statistics had also
    been conjectured early on [ 20 , 153 , 154 ] . This has so far not
    been confirmed experimentally, despite some promising hints [ 51 ]
    and some interesting proposals [ 308 , 147 , 177 , 178 , 78 , 360 ,
    361 ] .

-   In our approach, the emergence of fractional statistics comes about
    via the vector potential @xmath , as discussed in Section 7.1 .

-   One could formally gauge @xmath away and consider minimizing a usual
    magnetic Hamiltonian amongst wave functions satisfying ( 7.1.5 )
    with @xmath . This is not desirable since the magnetic gauge
    Hamiltonian acting on bosonic wave-functions we derive directly is
    more tractable, see Section 7.3 below and references therein.

-   The original paper [ 250 ] also discusses possible experimental
    signatures of the above statement. In some specific experimental
    regime, one can argue that a measurement of the density of the
    tracer particles should reveal a clear influence of fractional
    statistics.

-   The usual argument in favor of fractional statistics, originating in
    [ 20 ] (see also [ 179 , 180 , 181 , 264 ] ), proceeds by first
    treating the tracer particles/quasi-holes as classical parameters in
    the function ( 7.2.4 ). That is, we freeze the @xmath degree of
    freedom and consider @xmath as a family of parameters for the
    quasi-holes wave-function. One can compute that, upon moving a
    @xmath around another adiabatically, the quasi-holes wave-function
    picks a Berry phase @xmath . This Berry phase is then identified
    with the square of the statistics exchange phase quasi-holes should
    have in a quantum description. While certainly compelling, this
    argument is not devoid of issues (see for example [ 122 ] ).

-   The main leap of faith in the argument of [ 20 ] is the
    identification of the Berry phase picked by the bath particles’ wave
    function and the statistics phase of the tracer particles. This is
    completely avoided in our approach, since we do not appeal to the
    Berry phase concept at all.

### 7.3. Average-field approximation for almost bosonic anyons

Now that we have seen that anyons can emerge in some concrete physical
situations, we turn to the next obvious question. Namely: how does a
system of anyons behave, what characteristic features of it could be
observed ? Since the free anyon Hamiltonian ( 7.1.8 ) is pretty
intricate, and basically no general exact results are known (contrarily
to the case of free bosons or fermions), this raises the question of
deriving effective, simpler theories. In this section we report on the
results of [ 249 ] , where such an effective theory is rigorously
derived, in a mean-field-like limit.

#### 7.3.1. Model for trapped extended anyons

Here we consider the ground state problem for free anyons in a trapping
potential @xmath , that is we are interested in the bottom of the
spectrum of the Hamiltonian (we discard @xmath from the notation for
shortness)

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the gauge vector potential is again given by ( 7.1.9 ). Compared
to ( 7.1.8 ) and ( 7.2.8 ) we have discarded the external gauge vector
potential and the pair interaction. This is because they would not
complicate the picture significantly, at least with the approach we
follow in [ 249 ] . The above Hamiltonian can be rigorously defined and
shown to enjoy crucial functional inequalities [ 186 , 251 , 252 , 253 ]
. However, its complicated structure makes it very hard to draw precise
predictions, even about its ground state. To appreciate this, consider
formally expanding the squares in ( 7.3.1 ). We obtain

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (7.3.2)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

where we wrote

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for the 2D Coulomb kernel. We are thus dealing with ordinary bosons
(recall that we are interested in the action of @xmath on symmetric
wave-functions) that experience:

-   a two-body interaction mixing space and momentum variables (second
    line);

-   a three-body interaction (third line);

-   a singular two-body interaction (the terms on the fourth line are
    not locally integrable).

In this section we want to justify that, in spite of these peculiar
features, the ground state of @xmath can in some regime be approximated
in the form of a pure tensor power @xmath , in the spirit of Chapter 5 .
In the context of fractional statistics, such approximations are usually
refered to as “average-field models” [ 120 , 66 , 68 , 339 , 340 , 164 ,
350 ] .

An immediate difficulty is that pure tensor powers @xmath are not in the
domain of @xmath , because of the singular pair interaction. To remedy
this, we smear the Aharonov-Bohm flux carried by each particle on a disc
of radius @xmath : let

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and consider (observe that @xmath )

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.3.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

together with the regularized Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.3.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This so-called “extended anyons” model is discussed in [ 186 , 257 , 339
, 69 ] . Besides the fact that it offers a reasonable simplification of
the original Hamiltonian, one can motivate it because anyons should be
seen as emergent quasi-particles, and have thus a finite radius. In
Statement 7.2.1 , this is set by the radius of the hard-core we assumed
was contained in @xmath .

For fixed @xmath , this operator is self-adjoint on @xmath and we shall
denote

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.3.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

the associated ground state energy (lowest eigenvalue) for @xmath
extended anyons. We are interested in the asymptotics of @xmath and the
associated minimizers in the limit @xmath and @xmath .

#### 7.3.2. Justification of the average field approximation

To obtain a well-defined limit problem we set

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.3.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a given, fixed constant. This choice ensures that all
terms in ( 7.3.1 ) are formally of order @xmath or smaller. Physically
it means we consider “almost bosonic anyons”. One can also perturb
around fermions, but we have not studied this case. Note that if we
simply took @xmath at fixed @xmath , we would recover ordinary bosons at
leading order. One could then only see the effect of the non-trivial
statistics in a perturbative expansion, a route followed e.g. in [ 321 ,
76 , 322 , 272 , 75 ] .

The effective model we shall derive encodes the effect of anyon
statistics in the form of a self-consistent gauge field:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.3.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.3.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

One obtains this functional by the same kind of steps as in the case of
usual bosons with pair interactions: either replacing the magnetic gauge
vector potential by a mean-field, or by taking (essentially) an ansatz
of the form @xmath . We denote @xmath the ground state energy obtained
by minimizing ( 7.3.8 ) subject to the unit mass constraint

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For technical reasons we assume that the one-body potential is confining

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.3.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and that the size @xmath of the extended anyons does not go to zero too
fast in the limit @xmath . The following is the main result of [ 249 ] :

###### Theorem 7.3.1 (Validity of the average field approximation).

We consider @xmath extended anyons of radius @xmath in an external
potential @xmath satisfying ( 7.3.10 ). We assume the relation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.3.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and that the statistics parameter scales as ( 7.3.7 ).

Then, in the limit @xmath we have for the ground-state energy

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.3.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Moreover, if @xmath is a sequence of ground states for @xmath , with
associated reduced density matrices @xmath , then we have, along a
subsequence,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.3.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

strongly in the trace-class when @xmath , where @xmath is a Borel
probability measure supported on the set of minimizers of @xmath ,

A few comments:

-   The method of proof is inspired from that of [ 208 ] , cf Chapter 5
    . The use of the quantum de Finetti theorem is even more crucial
    here: there does not seem to be any way of using the structure of
    the magnetic gauge Hamiltonian to justify the approximation.

-   Actually, its peculiar form adds quite a few twists to the proof,
    compared to [ 208 ] . We have to rely on some specific functional
    inequalities [ 248 , 160 ] to control the error terms.

-   Note that the limit problem ( 7.3.8 ) comprises an effective
    self-consistent magnetic field. A term in the form of a
    self-consistent electric field is more usual. Taking the @xmath of
    @xmath we see that the effective field is directly proportional to
    the matter density.

-   We deal with the limit @xmath at the same time as @xmath because
    typically the anyon radius should be much smaller than the total
    system’s size. This is reminiscent of the NLS and GP limits for
    trapped Bose gases, see again Chapter 5 and references therein.

-   Taking @xmath not too small in the limit @xmath is a requirement in
    our method of proof. It is in fact not clear whether some lower
    bound on @xmath is a necessary condition for the average field
    description to be correct. For very small or zero @xmath , it is
    still conceivable that a description in terms of a functional of the
    form of ( 7.3.8 ) is correct in the limit. A first satisfying step
    would be to allow @xmath , the typical inter-particle distance.
