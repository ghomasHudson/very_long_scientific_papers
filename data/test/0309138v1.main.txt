## Chapter \thechapter Introduction

### 1 Historical Background

Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the accepted theory of high energy
strong interactions. It is the gauge theory describing the interactions
of coloured particles, quarks and gluons, which are commonly accepted to
be the fundamental degrees of freedom of hadronic matter.

The non-abelian nature of QCD results in a collection of non-trivial
complications when compared to the archetypal gauge theory quantum
electrodynamics (QED). Most serious is the phenomenon of asymptotic
freedom which dictates that the QCD coupling constant, @xmath , is not
in fact constant. Rather it depends on the energy scale of the process
in question. The calculation of the one-loop @xmath function Gross and
Wilczek ( 1973 ); Politzer ( 1973 ) demonstrated that the QCD coupling
constant is small only for high energy processes; a fact observed in
experiment. This discovery was instrumental in the establishment of QCD
as a theory of strong interactions.

Asymptotic scaling poses a serious problem to quantitative tests of QCD.
The traditional perturbative techniques used in high precision tests of
QED rely on expansions about a small coupling constant. Consequently
such techniques are only applicable to high energy QCD processes.
Perturbative QCD has had a great deal of success explaining such
processes.

The first quantitative demonstration of the validity of perturbative QCD
was in the violation of Bjorken scaling in deep-inelastic lepton-hadron
scattering (for example see Ref. Gribov and Lipatov ( 1972 ) ). More
recently high order QCD calculations of jet rates in hadron colliders
have shown impressive agreement with experimental data. Less striking
tests of perturbative QCD have been made in the analysis of @xmath
lepton decays, heavy-quarkonium decay and also in @xmath collisions. For
a recent review see Ref. Hagiwara et al. ( 2002 ) .

For low energy processes the QCD coupling constant is large.
Consequently traditional perturbative techniques can not be used to test
the validity of QCD in this regime. A great deal of interesting physics
appears in this nonperturbative regime. One would like to test whether
the same theory that successfully explains a broad range of high energy
processes also gives rise to quark confinement, provides a mechanism for
chiral symmetry breaking, gives rise to the correct values for the
hadronic mass spectrum and explains other low-energy phenomena. Without
the use of non-perturbative techniques the situation is dire. One cannot
calculate such mental quantities as the masses of mesons and baryons
even if given the coupling constant and the constituent quark masses.
The need to probe the low-energy regime of QCD has given rise to many
QCD motivated models Chodos et al. ( 1974 ); Cornwall and Soni ( 1983 );
Isgur and Paton ( 1985 ); Johnson and Teper ( 2002 ) . However, only one
first principles approach to nonperturbative QCD is currently known and
that is lattice gauge theory (LGT).

LGT was originally developed in the Lagrangian formulation by Wilson in
1975 Wilson ( 1974 ) . A year later the corresponding Hamiltonian
formulation was published by Kogut and Susskind Kogut and Susskind (
1975 ) . The basic approximation of LGT is the replacement of continuous
and infinite space-time by a discrete lattice of sites and links. The
essential difference between the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations
is that in the former time is left continuous. Using LGT one can
presumably calculate the full range of hadronic properties from mass
spectra and wave functions to decay constants and matrix elements. The
hadronic matrix elements appearing in the weak decays of hadrons are of
particular interest. Phenomenologists are waiting for lattice estimates
to such matrix elements in order to improve the theoretical
understanding of the CKM matrix Beneke ( 2002 ); Ryan ( 2002 ) . Another
area of recent interest has been in the study of QCD in extreme
conditions. A knowledge of the phase diagram of QCD is relevant to the
understanding of high density quark systems such as the early universe,
neutron stars and heavy ion collisions. The scope of LGT is summarised
in Ref. Gupta ( 1997 ) .

In practice LGT cannot, at this stage, predict the complete range of
hadronic phenomena. The major stumbling block is the requirement of time
on the largest supercomputers in existence to calculate basic quantities
with accuracy. In the early days of LGT strong coupling expansions in
the Hamiltonian approach provided compelling evidence for the
confinement of quarks by showing that the potential energy between two
infinitely heavy quarks grows linearly with their separation Kogut and
Susskind ( 1975 ); Kogut ( 1980 ) . This was without the complication of
dynamical quarks and in the strong coupling limit which is far from the
real world physics of the continuum. The inclusion of two flavours of
quarks and the extension to physical couplings came much later and
required the numerical techniques of Lagrangian LGT. The qualitative
result of the strong coupling expansions did not however change (for
example see Ref. Bali et al. ( 2000 ) and references within).

Most LGT calculations to date have been performed using Monte Carlo
techniques in the Lagrangian approach. Until recently most simulations
used the so called quenched approximation in which the vacuum
polarization effects of the QCD vacuum are explicitly removed. The
calculation of certain hadron masses are within 10% of the
experimentally observed results using the quenched approximation Aoki
et al. ( 2000 ) . Calculations utilising full QCD with two flavours of
quarks have been performed and show significant improvements over the
quenched approximation Yoshie ( 2002 ) . At this stage the advancement
of LGT in the Lagrangian approach is restricted by the available
computational resources.

There are some areas of research where progress in the Lagrangian
formulation has been significantly slow. Some examples are in
calculations involving excited states and the determination of the QCD
phase diagram. Such slow progress and the need for significant
computational resources in Lagrangian LGT suggests that alternative
methods should be pursued in parallel. A viable alternative is
Hamiltonian LGT, which may have a number of advantages. It has been
suggested that Hamiltonian LGT could more readily handle finite density
QCD Gregory et al. ( 2000 ) . Indeed, the problems encountered in finite
density QCD in the Lagrangian formulation has prompted a return to the
strong coupling expansions of early Hamiltonian LGT Bringoltz and
Svetitsky ( 2002 ) . Additional areas in which Hamiltonian LGT may have
an advantage over the Lagrangian approach are in calculations involving
excited sites, time dependent quantities and wave functions. An
appealing aspect of the Hamiltonian approach is that it reduces LGT to a
many body problem. As such a host of analytic techniques from many body
theory are applicable. Techniques such as the coupled cluster method
Coester ( 1958 ); Coester and Kümmel ( 1960 ); Ligterink et al. ( 2000
); McKellar et al. ( 2000 ) , plaquette expansion Hollenberg ( 1993 ,
1994 ); McIntosh and Hollenberg ( 2002a , b ) and variational methods
Arisue et al. ( 1983 ); Arisue ( 1990 ) have had success in recent years
in calculations of glueball masses. These calculations however have been
performed without the inclusion of quarks, often in less dimensions that
the physical 3+1 and often using lower dimensional gauge groups than the
physical case of SU(3).

The self interactions of gluons in QCD allow the existence of massive
states containing only gluon degrees of freedom Fritzsch and Gell-Mann (
1972 ); Fritzsch et al. ( 1973 ) . Although QCD provides a theory of
strong interactions we have little understanding of the physical states
of the theory. The constituent quark model provides an excellent
phenomenological description of meson and baryon spectroscopy. QCD
inspired models however predict the existence of other hadrons. These
hadrons include not only the glueballs, which are often described as
bound states of two and three gluons, but other more exotic states as
well. So called hybrid particles, which have both quark and excited
gluon degrees of freedom, have been predicted to exist. Until the
properties of the physical states of QCD can be reliably calculated, and
these calculations stand up to experimental tests, we cannot claim to
understand the nonperturbative aspects of QCD. From both theoretical and
experimental sides there have been significant developments in the
search for glueballs in recent years.

On the theoretical side calculations of the glueball mass spectrum have
been dominated by LGT calculations in the Lagrangian approach. The
calculations of the last decade are nearing agreement at least for the
lowest mass glueballs. The emerging picture is that the scalar glueball
with quantum numbers @xmath is the lightest with a mass in the range
1.4–1.8 GeV. Interestingly the next lowest mass states in the @xmath
sector have spin ordering 2, 3, 1, whereas the ordering in the @xmath
sector is 1, 3, 2, 0. The status of LGT glueball calculations in the
Lagrangian approach is reviewed in Refs. Bali ( 2001 ) and Morningstar (
2002 ) .

On the experimental side progress has been hampered by numerous
technical difficulties. Perhaps most significant is the fact that
glueballs can mix strongly with nearby @xmath resonances. To search for
glueballs one needs to probe glue rich processes. Recent searches have
taken place in radiative @xmath decay, @xmath annihilations and central
production in @xmath collisions. A review of search techniques is
presented in Ref. Godfrey and Napolitano ( 1999 ) . Perhaps the most
promising glueball candidates are the @xmath and @xmath resonances (the
subscript denotes the total angular momentum and the argument the mass
in MeV). The interpretation of these resonances has been the subject of
much debate, particularly with regard to mixing with @xmath states. Some
authors argue that the @xmath has a dominant glueball contribution while
the glueball content of @xmath is minimal Amsler ( 2002 ); Amsler and
Close ( 1996 ) . Other authors argue the opposite case Lee and
Weingarten ( 2000 ); Sexton et al. ( 1995 ) . Improved data from
non-appearance searches in @xmath collisions could possibly resolve this
issue Acciarri et al. ( 2001 ) . The basis for these studies lies in the
fact that the glueball to two photon widths are small compared to those
of mesons since gluons do not couple directly with photons. Such studies
will also be important in the identification of other glueball
candidates such as @xmath Benslama et al. ( 2002 ) .

The focus of most of the lattice community, as far as glueballs are
concerned, has been the physically interesting case of SU(3) glueballs
in 3+1 dimensions. In recent years the study of glueballs belonging to
higher dimensional gauge groups in both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions has
received intense interest from the string theory community. The reason
for this is that the SU( @xmath ) glueball mass spectrum in the large
@xmath limit provides an ideal laboratory for quantitative tests of
Maldacena’s conjecture and its later extensions. We defer the discussion
of this topic to Section 34 .

While accurate studies of the SU(3) glueball spectrum in 3+1 dimensions
may be some way off in Hamiltonian LGT, studies of the SU( @xmath )
glueball spectrum in 2+1 dimensions are definitely feasible. In fact it
appears that the Hamiltonian approach has a distinct advantage over the
Lagrangian approach in that excited states are easily accessed. Current
Lagrangian calculations have extracted the three lowest mass states in
some sectors in the large @xmath limit. With Hamiltonian techniques it
is feasible to even triple this number. The accurate simulation of large
mass excited states is of immediate interest to QCD inspired models of
glueballs such as the bag model Chodos et al. ( 1974 ) , potential
models Cornwall and Soni ( 1983 ) and the flux-tube model Isgur and
Paton ( 1985 ) and its extensions Johnson and Teper ( 2002 ) . The last
of these in fact shows remarkable agreement with the lowest excited
state masses calculated on the lattice in 2+1 dimensions for all but the
@xmath state Johnson and Teper ( 2002 ) .

The results so far obtained in Lagrangian LGT have been made possible by
an extensive improvement programme initiated by Symanzik nearly twenty
years ago Symanzik ( 1983a , b ) . The formulation of QCD on a lattice
introduces errors which can be expressed in powers of the lattice
spacing @xmath and the QCD coupling and start at @xmath . When
performing a lattice calculation in the Lagrangian approach the most
important factor in determining the computational cost is the lattice
spacing. In fact it has been predicted that the cost of a full QCD
simulation varies as @xmath Jegerlehner et al. ( 2000 ) . Thus it is
very important to be able to work on coarse lattices. This of course is
a move away from the @xmath limit in which the real world physics of the
continuum is retrieved. This realisation has motivated the development
of improved actions (for a review see Ref. Lepage ( 1996 ) ). These
actions aim to systematically remove the errors caused by placing QCD on
a lattice. In practice these actions allow one be closer to the
continuum limit when working with a given lattice spacing. The
additional computational cost of working with the more complicated
improved actions is by far outweighed by the benefits of working on
coarse lattices. The development of improved actions has been a crucial
factor in the progress of LGT in the last 15 years. It has allowed
routine calculations to be performed on work stations and has brought
the numerical solution of full QCD tantalisingly close.

In contrast the improvement of Hamiltonian LGT has hardly begun. Perhaps
the most comprehensive study into the derivation of improved
Hamiltonians to date is due to Luo, Guo, Kröger and Schütte Luo et al. (
1999 ) . Their study started with an improved Lagrangian and derived
improved Hamiltonians with the standard transfer matrix and Legendre
transformation techniques. Using these techniques it became clear that
the construction of an improved kinetic Hamiltonian with a finite number
of terms is a non-trivial problem. Using a more direct method improved
Hamiltonians can be constructed with relative ease. In this thesis we
propose a method for the direct improvement of Hamiltonian LGT which is
in the spirit of the original Kogut-Susskind derivation. This topic is
the focus of Chapter \thechapter .

We now move on to a description of the outline of the thesis.

### 2 Outline of the Thesis

As a form of introduction, in Chapter \thechapter , the fundamental
approximations of LGT are detailed. The basic steps involved in a
Hamiltonian lattice calculation are also discussed as well as the
important topic of how the real world physics of the continuum is
retrieved.

Chapters \thechapter and \thechapter are concerned primarily with the
topic of improvement. In Chapter \thechapter we develop a technique
which allows the straightforward construction of lattice Hamiltonians
for gluons in @xmath dimensions. A variety of improved Hamiltonians are
derived using this method. These improved Hamiltonians are devoid of the
lowest order discretisation errors present in the unimproved
Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian. In Chapter \thechapter we present some
simple checks on improvement for the cases of U(1) in 3+1 dimensions and
SU(2) in 2+1 dimensions. In this way we test the level of improvement
achieved by a selection of the Hamiltonians derived in Chapter
\thechapter .

In Chapter \thechapter we move on to the topic of analytic methods. Here
we introduce techniques which allow analytic lattice calculations of SU(
@xmath ) glueball masses in 2+1 dimensions for general @xmath . Such
techniques extend the SU(2) methods of Arisue Arisue et al. ( 1983 ) to
the general case of SU( @xmath ). These techniques are applied in
Chapter \thechapter in the calculation of glueball masses in 2+1
dimensions with @xmath . Kogut-Susskind, improved and tadpole improved
Hamiltonians, all of which are derived in Chapter \thechapter , are used
and their results compared.

In Chapter \thechapter we move on to an analytic study of large @xmath
physics on the lattice. Here we study the large @xmath glueball mass
spectrum in 2+1 dimensions using the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian. Using
the analytic techniques of Chapter \thechapter , calculations with
@xmath as large as 25 are possible on a desktop computer, allowing an
accurate extrapolation to the @xmath limit. Chapters \thechapter and
\thechapter contain the key results of this thesis.

In Chapter \thechapter we move on to explore the viability of adapting
the analytic techniques, used with success in Chapters \thechapter and
\thechapter , to the physically interesting case of 3+1 dimensions.
Here, the difficulties of a move to 3+1 dimensions are discussed.
Calculations of glueball masses within a simplistic, one cube, model are
presented as a first step in testing the worth of analytic variational
techniques in 3+1 dimensions.

Chapter \thechapter contains a summary of our findings and our
conclusions.

## Chapter \thechapter Gauge Theory on a Lattice

### 3 Introduction

In this chapter we describe the basic steps involved in Hamiltonian LGT
calculations. Our intention is to introduce the fundamental
approximations of LGT and the topics of importance to recovering the
real world physics of the continuum. We start with an explanation of how
quarks and gluons are put on a lattice in Section 4 . In this section
the important difference in the building blocks of LGT and continuum
gauge theory are discussed. We then move on to explain the steps
involved in performing a calculation in Hamiltonian LGT. We finish in
Section 8 with a discussion of the important topic of how the real world
physics of the continuum is extracted from a calculation on the lattice.

### 4 The Lattice

The fundamental simplification of LGT is the replacement of continuous
and infinite space-time with a finite and discrete lattice of sites and
links. A label, @xmath , is attached to each link. Here is the starting
point of link @xmath and @xmath its direction. Quark fields are
essentially treated in the same way on the lattice as they are in
continuum QCD. In both theories they are represented by Grassmann
variables. However, in LGT the quark fields are restricted to lattice
sites. As in the continuum, the fermion fields can be integrated out of
the partition function exactly giving a highly non-local fermion
determinant, @xmath . The calculation of this determinant is the key
factor in the computational expense of full QCD simulations in
Lagrangian LGT. The quenched approximation, in which the vacuum
polarisation effects of the QCD vacuum are explicitly removed, gives
@xmath a constant value, reducing both the computational expense and the
connection to real world physics of LGT. It is in this approximation
that the bulk of Lagrangian LGT calculations have been carried out.

In LGT gluons are incorporated differently to continuum gauge theory in
order to maintain manifest gauge invariance on the lattice. In continuum
SU( @xmath ) gauge theory gluons are represented by the SU( @xmath )
valued fields @xmath . In LGT gluons are represented by Wilson lines (or
link operators) along the links joining lattice sites. We denote the
link operator on link @xmath by @xmath . The link operator on the same
link but taken in the opposite direction is given by @xmath . At times
it will be convenient to use the more detailed notation, @xmath , for
the link operator on link @xmath . It is conventional to represent the
link operator by a directed line segment joining the sites and @xmath ,
as shown in Fig. 1 . Here @xmath is a unit vector in the @xmath
direction. The details of this construction and precisely how it relates
to the continuum theory will be introduced in Section 12.2 . The
fundamental differences between continuum gauge theory and LGT are
caricatured in Fig. 2 . As in Fig. 2 it is conventional to denote the
lattice spacing by @xmath .

Having discussed the fundamental approximation of LGT and briefly
introduced its building blocks we now move on to a description of the
steps involved in a complete Hamiltonian LGT calculation. The first step
is choosing an appropriate lattice.

### 5 Defining a Lattice

In Hamiltonian LGT one works on a spatial lattice. The time coordinate
remains continuous. Contrastingly, the Lagrangian formulation
discretises all dimensions and works in Euclidean space. An obvious
advantage of the Hamiltonian approach is that one works with a lattice
with one less dimension. The cartoon in Fig. 2 illustrates a cubic
lattice in three dimensions. LGT is not, however, restricted to 3
dimensions and the lattice itself is not restricted to a cubic
arrangement.

For reasons of simplicity, it has been conventional to study LGTs built
on cubic lattices. Not a great deal of effort has been devoted to
exploring the effect of using lattices with different structures
Wichmann ( 2001 ) . One could however imagine that working on a
non-cubic lattice could be advantageous in some situations. For example,
if the degrees of freedom were arranged into products of link operators
(which is often convenient) around the elementary faces of the lattice
(for example squares of side length @xmath in the cubic case), working
on non-cubic lattices could be advantageous when the number of faces and
number of links need to be related in a precise way to incorporate
constraints such as Gauss’ law Ligterink et al. ( 2000 ) . In this
thesis we work on a @xmath dimensional spatial lattice with @xmath and
3.

When performing numerical LGT calculations the primary restriction is
computer memory. The value of every link operator on the lattice needs
to be stored in memory at a given time. Since the number of links on the
lattice increases quickly as the volume increases, one is in practice
limited to lattices with small volumes. The majority of work in LGT to
date has involved small volume numerical simulations in the Lagrangian
approach. Typical calculations on supercomputers with speeds of the
order of hundreds of gigaflops ¹ ¹ 1 1 flop = 1 floating point operation
per second with two flavours of dynamical quarks are performed on @xmath
lattices. It has been estimated that with access to a 10 teraflop
machine @xmath lattices will be able to be used for equivalent
calculations with similar effort Jegerlehner et al. ( 2000 ) .

Variational studies in Hamiltonian LGT in 3+1 dimensions (which go
beyond the strong coupling limit), to our knowledge, have only dealt
with small lattices; typically with sizes smaller than @xmath Chin
et al. ( 1988 ); Long et al. ( 1988 ) . We discuss the viability of
using analytic Hamiltonian techniques in 3+1 dimensions in Chapter
\thechapter .

Having defined a lattice we now move on to the important step of
constructing a Hamiltonian.

### 6 Constructing a Hamiltonian

When constructing a Hamiltonian on the lattice there are three important
points to consider. Firstly, the lattice Hamiltonian must reduce to its
continuum counterpart in the limit of vanishing lattice spacing. From
here on we refer to this limit as the continuum limit. Secondly, we must
incorporate as many symmetries of the continuum theory as possible.
Finally, the lattice Hamiltonian must not be prohibitively expensive to
use. These points are closely related and often an attempt to address
one point is detrimental to another. For example, if one attempts to
build a Hamiltonian that is closer to its continuum counterpart for a
given lattice spacing, one with a weak dependence on @xmath , one is
left unavoidably with a more computationally intensive Hamiltonian.
Another example relates to restoring rotational symmetry. On the
lattice, continuous rotational symmetry is broken down to a discrete
analogue which depends on the particular lattice in use. One can attempt
to construct Hamiltonians with improved rotational symmetry but again
the resulting Hamiltonian is more computationally expensive than the
simplest versions.

One symmetry that is essential to incorporate in the lattice Hamiltonian
is local gauge invariance. One may ask why it is important to uphold
local gauge invariance when other symmetries such as rotational
invariance and Lorentz invariance are explicitly broken. The reason lies
in the fact that with local gauge invariance upheld the bare gluon mass
is zero and the couplings appearing at multiple gluon and gluon-quark
vertices are all equal. Without local gauge invariance these couplings
would need to be tuned independently in order to retrieve real world
physics. This is a complication that would become prohibitively
expensive when processes with loop diagrams were taking into
consideration.

In building lattice Hamiltonians we have a great deal of freedom. Our
only restrictions are gauge invariance and the need to obtain the
correct continuum limit. Our approach is to start with gauge invariant
lattice operators and form linear combinations such that the correct
continuum limit is obtained. In this way Hamiltonians, which couple
links with various separations, can be easily constructed. This process
is discussed in detail in Sections 12 and 13 .

Having constructed a Hamiltonian the next step in a Hamiltonian LGT
calculation is to choose an appropriate wave function.

### 7 Choosing a Wave Function

In this section we discuss the issues involved in choosing a wave
function. We start with a discussion of lattice symmetries and finish by
mentioning some practical concerns.

When performing a LGT calculation one is usually interested in studying
a particle with certain symmetry properties. For instance in this thesis
we study the masses of glueballs in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions. These
glueballs can be classified according to their total angular momentum,
@xmath , charge conjugation, @xmath , and parity, @xmath eigenvalues. In
order to study these particles we need to construct suitable wave
functions. The restrictions on the wave function are firstly, that it be
gauge invariant, and secondly, possess the symmetry properties of the
continuum state we wish to study. As we will see in Section 12.3 , the
former forces us to construct our state from Wilson loops, the latter
requires us to choose particular combinations of Wilson loops with
certain symmetry properties.

Suppose for example we work with a Hamiltonian symmetric under parity
transformations ² ² 2 We use the notation, @xmath , to represent an
operator and, @xmath to represent an eigenvalue. , @xmath , charge
conjugation, @xmath , and rotations by @xmath . Then the Hamiltonian
commutes with @xmath , @xmath and the lattice spin operator @xmath .
Consequently the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian can be labelled by their
respective @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath eigenvalues. @xmath has the
effect of replacing the lattice coupling, which we denote by @xmath , by
@xmath . This is equivalent to the replacement @xmath . To define the
parity operator and explore rotations on the lattice we need to be more
careful. We start with a description of parity.

With three spatial dimensions, the effect of @xmath is to replace
lattice sites by @xmath . However in two spatial dimensions, with one
less axis to rotate about, the same prescription (of course with the
@xmath component taken to be zero) is equivalent to a pure rotation. In
2+1 dimensions we can define @xmath as a reflection in one axis. For
example, in this thesis we will take

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (1)
  -- -------- -- -----

Next we discuss the more difficult topic of rotational symmetry.

The rotational symmetry properties of lattice operators are restricted
to the particular rotational symmetries of the lattice. In the 3+1
dimensional continuum rotational symmetry is continuous and the spin of
a state is characterised by the irreducible representations of the
rotation group SO(3). The situation on the lattice is quite different.
On a cubic lattice the SO(3) rotational symmetry of the continuum is
broken down to the cubic or octahedral group O. Since the lattice
Hamiltonian is symmetric under cubic rotations its eigenstates must be
classified in terms of the irreducible representations of O, not of
SO(3). The classification of lattice states in terms of the irreducible
representations of O was developed by Berg and Billoire Berg and
Billoire ( 1983 ) . An analogous situation occurs in 2+1 dimensions. As
we will see in Section 30.2 the result is an ambiguity in spin
identification on the lattice. For instance on a 2 dimensional square
lattice one can only determine the continuum spin of a state modulo 4
with standard techniques Teper ( 1999 ) . One can determine the spins of
the lowest mass states when using smeared links within the Lagrangian
approach Teper ( 1999 ) . This approach, however, does not allow the
spins of excited states to be determined. Techniques are available to
counter this problem Johnson and Teper ( 1999 ); Johnson ( 2002 ) but
currently their use is at an exploratory stage.

In 3+1 dimensions the situation is less problematic. Since there is an
additional axis to rotate about, one can count the multiplicity of
states to help determine continuum spins. Additional methods, specific
to 3+1 dimensions, have been developed to distinguish spin 0 and spin 4
states with a careful choice of lattice operators Liu and Wu ( 2002 ) .

A further consideration in the construction of appropriate wave
functions is translational invariance. On the lattice, states with
particular momenta are constructed in the usual way via Fourier
transforms. In this thesis we will be concerned with the calculation of
masses, for which translationally invariant zero momenta states suffice.

The last issue to discuss is one of a practical nature. A benefit of the
Hamiltonian approach is that analytic techniques are available for use.
This is only the case if one makes use of wave functions which result in
expectation values for which analytic results are available. If the
expectation values are not able to be handled analytically one must
resort to Monte Carlo techniques for their calculation Long et al. (
1988 ) . Unsurprisingly wave functions which allow analytic calculations
have less appealing continuum limits than those which must be handled
numerically Long et al. ( 1988 ) .

Having discussed the issues involved in choosing a trial state we now
move on to discuss the important topic of how continuum physics is
extracted from a lattice calculation.

### 8 Extracting Continuum Physics

In this section we explain how continuum results are extracted from a
lattice calculation in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions. This will serve as an
introduction to the form in which the results of later chapters are
presented. In the context of this thesis the primary difference between
2+1 and 3+1 dimensions is the dimension of the coupling constant. As we
shall see in Section 12.5 the coupling constant, @xmath , is
dimensionless in 3+1 dimensions but has the units of mass in 2+1
dimensions. We start with a general discussion of how continuum results
are extracted from a LGT calculation. We then specialise to the cases of
3+1 and 2+1 dimensions.

When performing a calculation on the lattice one is always interested in
eventually extracting continuum physics. The process of unmasking
continuum physics however is highly nontrivial. Naively one would expect
continuum results to be obtained simply in the limit as @xmath .
However, if this naive limit is taken in a lattice calculation of a
given physical quantity either zero or infinity is obtained depending on
the dimension of the quantity under consideration. To achieve physical
results one must tune the coupling constant in such a way that a finite
result is obtained for all physical quantities.

To illustrate the process consider the calculation of a physical
quantity, @xmath , on the lattice with dimension in units of the lattice
spacing @xmath . As an example @xmath could be the mass of a physical
state, in which case @xmath . In Hamiltonian LGT one typically
calculates @xmath for a number of couplings, arriving at

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (2)
  -- -------- -- -----

Here @xmath is a dimensionless function which may depend on the
coupling, @xmath , either directly or via the parameters of the wave
functions used in the calculation of @xmath . It is clear from Eq. ( 2 )
that in the naive limit, @xmath , @xmath approaches either infinity or
zero (depending on the sign of @xmath ). It is clear that for a finite
result one must let @xmath vary with @xmath in such a way that a
sensible result is obtained for @xmath as @xmath . It is only in this
limit that the real world physics of the continuum is recovered. The
nontrivial aspect of this limit is immediately clear. The dependence of
@xmath on @xmath must be chosen so that all physical observables have a
well defined @xmath limit. The complexity lies in the fact that for each
physical observable @xmath there is a different @xmath in Eq. ( 2 ). The
coupling must be tuned in such a way that as it approaches its @xmath
limit all physical observables tend to constant values.

The lattice is a regularisation scheme which reduces the continuum
theory to a theory with a finite number of degrees of freedom. The
process of tuning the coupling constant described above is the
renormalisation process which precisely removes the dependence of the
calculation on the regularisation scheme. Precisely how the coupling
depends on @xmath is dictated by the Callan-Symanzik @xmath function

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (3)
  -- -------- -- -----

One can make specific predictions about the form of @xmath in weakly
coupled QCD. Including up to two loop contributions it has been shown
Caswell ( 1974 ); Jones ( 1974 ) that for 3+1 dimensional SU( @xmath )
gauge theory with @xmath flavours of quarks,

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (4)
  -- -------- -- -----

A four loop calculation of @xmath is also available van Ritbergen et al.
( 1997 ) . In this thesis we will always be concerned with the quarkless
case @xmath . Making use of Eq. ( 4 ) one can integrate the one loop
part of Eq. ( 3 ) directly to obtain for the quarkless case

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (5)
  -- -------- -- -----

where @xmath is the inverse ’t Hooft coupling @xmath . The integration
constant, @xmath , with dimensions of mass is commonly called the
lattice scale parameter. It can be related perturbatively, at the one
Dashen and Gross ( 1981 ); Hasenfratz and Hasenfratz ( 1981 ) and two
loop level Lüscher and Weisz ( 1995 ) , to the scale parameters obtained
from other regularisation schemes. Such results are important when
comparing results from LGT to results obtained with other regularisation
schemes. It is important to note that by inverting Eq. ( 5 ) it is clear
that we must have @xmath as @xmath . Since they are different
regularisation schemes, the scale parameters of Hamiltonian and
Lagrangian LGT also differ. Results for their ratios are available
Hasenfratz and Hasenfratz ( 1981 ); Hamer ( 1996 ) and are necessary for
the comparison of results obtained in the two formulations in the
continuum limit.

When attempting to extract continuum physics from a Hamiltonian LGT
calculation one generally looks for a range of couplings for which Eq. (
5 ) applies. If such a range of couplings, called a scaling window,
exists all observables with dimensions of mass must scale in the same
way as @xmath ; all masses must be proportional to @xmath in a scaling
window. The window does not, in practice, extend all the way to @xmath .
Generally the approximations used to perform the calculation break down
before then. One generally assumes that if the approximations used in
the calculations were improved the scaling window would extend closer to
@xmath .

To demonstrate how continuum physics is extracted in practice consider
the calculation of a mass on the lattice in pure SU( @xmath ) gauge
theory. We calculate the mass, @xmath for a range of couplings. To
observe asymptotic scaling we require

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (6)
  -- -------- -- -----

for some range of couplings. Here @xmath is the continuum limit mass in
units of @xmath . Making use of Eq. ( 5 ) we see that

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (7)
  -- -------- -- -----

Thus in a scaling window a plot of @xmath versus @xmath yields a
straight line with gradient @xmath . The observation of such behaviour
allows the constant of proportionality, @xmath , to be extracted. We
refer to the type of scaling where all masses scale as Eq. ( 5 ) as
“asymptotic scaling”. If such behaviour is observed one can be confident
that the lattice spacing is small enough that continuum physics is being
revealed and an accurate value for the continuum limit mass is obtained.

A less general type of scaling can be seen in the ratios of masses.
Since all masses scale as Eq. ( 6 ) for small enough lattice spacing,
the ratios of masses become constant in a scaling window. However, a
ratio of masses may happen to be constant on a much larger scaling
window, one where the lattice scale parameter does not obey Eq. ( 5 )
for its entire range of couplings. In such a region the non-zero errors,
which depend on @xmath and @xmath , cancel to some extent and the ratio
reproduces the correct continuum ratio. We refer to this more general
situation as “scaling” which is not to be confused with asymptotic
scaling.

The final step in obtaining a result in familiar units is to fix the
value of @xmath in physical units (MeV for example). This is most
commonly done by by comparing the string tension @xmath calculated on
the lattice in units of @xmath with the physical value in units of MeV
obtained from the spectroscopy of heavy quarkonia. The string tension is
the coefficient of the linearly rising potential energy as a
quark-antiquark pair are separated. We introduce the string tension in
Section 19 . A commonly used value for SU(3) in 3+1 dimensions is @xmath
MeV Teper ( 1998 ) .

The above discussion treats the case of 3+1 dimensions. To renormalise
the results of an LGT calculation on a lattice with different numbers of
dimensions requires a different treatment. For the case of 2+1
dimensions, with which we are concerned for the bulk of this thesis, the
situation is particularly simple. For this case the coupling constant,
@xmath , has dimensions of mass, in contrast to the 3+1 dimensional case
for which it is dimensionless. The coupling constant can therefore be
used to explicitly set the scale of the lattice theory. This has become
standard practice in 2+1 dimensional LGT, both in the Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian approaches. Consequently, in the limit of vanishing lattice
spacing all masses calculated on the lattice must approach a constant
value when measured in units of the coupling,

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (8)
  -- -------- -- -----

Here @xmath is the continuum limit mass in units of @xmath . In 2+1
dimensional LGT, the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations again
present different regularisations of the continuum gauge theory. To
compare the results of the two formulations one needs to acknowledge
that the coupling constants of the two formulations differ. Their ratio
can be calculated perturbatively Hamer ( 1996 ) for small couplings in
pure SU( @xmath ) LGT and is close to unity.

### 9 Conclusion

In this chapter we have introduced the basic approximations made in LGT.
We have discussed briefly the steps involved in a Hamiltonian LGT
calculation, introducing in particular the important steps of choosing
wave functions and extracting continuum physics. Our intention was to
provide a method-independent introduction to the process of a
Hamiltonian LGT calculation in order to introduce the notation in which
the results of later chapters are presented. In the next chapter we
consider in detail the process of constructing and improving lattice
Hamiltonians.

## Chapter \thechapter Constructing and Improving Lattice Hamiltonians

### 10 Introduction

In this chapter we develop a technique which allows the straightforward
construction of Hamiltonians for gluons in @xmath dimensions. We start
with a historical background in Section 11 to motivate the need for
additional Hamiltonians beyond the original Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian.
In Section 12 we derive the simplest Hamiltonian for gluons on the
lattice, the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian, focussing on the errors
occurring when it is compared to its continuum counterpart. These errors
can be divided into two classes, classical and quantum. The origin of
each class of error is discussed in Section 12.2 . We then turn our
attention to the removal of classical errors in Section 13 , deriving
the simplest classically improved lattice Hamiltonian by adding
appropriately weighted gauge invariant lattice operators. We refer to
this technique as direct improvement. In Section 14 we discuss the topic
of tadpole improvement, a technique for correcting a particular type of
quantum error, which has revolutionised Lagrangian LGT in the last 15
years. In particular we discuss its implementation in the Hamiltonian
formulation. We finish the chapter in Section 15 with a derivation of an
improved lattice Hamiltonian which couples distant lattice sites. This
highlights the ease with which improved Hamiltonians can be constructed
with the direct method of improvement.

### 11 Historical Background

The Hamiltonian formulation of LGT was developed by Kogut and Susskind
Kogut and Susskind ( 1975 ) . Their Hamiltonian was derived by demanding
the correct continuum limit be obtained in the limit of vanishing
lattice spacing. This was the style in which the Wilson action was
derived a year earlier. Creutz showed that the Kogut-Susskind
Hamiltonian could be derived from the Wilson action using the transfer
matrix method Creutz ( 1983 ) . Later Kogut demonstrated that the same
could be done by taking the continuous time limit of the Wilson action
and performing a canonical Legendre transformation Kogut ( 1983 ) .

When building a gauge theory on a lattice, the infinite number of
degrees of freedom of continuum theory is reduced to a large but
manageable number. The price to pay, however, is that errors are made.
In order to obtain an accurate extrapolation to continuum physics these
errors need careful attention.

As discussed in Section 1 much work in the last fifteen years has been
devoted to improving lattice actions. The motivation for improvement in
the action formulation is computational cost. Since the cost of a
Lagrangian LGT calculation varies as @xmath Jegerlehner et al. ( 2000 )
, it is by far more efficient to build improved theories than to work on
finer lattices. The improvement programme, in particular tadpole
improvement, has allowed accurate calculations to be performed on
relatively coarse lattices on desktop computers and brought the
simulations full QCD within the reach of today’s most powerful
computers.

In contrast, the improvement of lattice Hamiltonians has only recently
begun. With most computational techniques in the Hamiltonian
formulation, as one moves closer to the continuum limit calculations
require the symbolic manipulation of an increasing number of
increasingly complicated lattice operators. The motivation for
improvement in the Hamiltonian approach is that when working at a given
lattice spacing (or coupling) one is closer to the continuum limit when
using an improved Hamiltonian. In this way the effort required to reach
the continuum limit is reduced, provided the improved Hamiltonian is not
prohibitively difficult to work with. Perhaps the most extensive
treatment to date is due to Luo, Guo, Kröger and Schütte who discussed
the classical and tadpole improvement of Hamiltonian LGT for gluons Luo
et al. ( 1999 ) . In their study it was discovered that deriving an
improved Hamiltonian from a classically improved action, whether by
transfer matrix or Legendre transformation methods, results in a highly
non-local kinetic term with an infinite number of terms. To derive a
kinetic Hamiltonian with only nearest neighbour terms it was found
necessary to start with an improved action with an infinite number of
terms, coupling arbitrarily distant lattice sites.

With the technique of Luo et al the order @xmath errors are removed from
the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian. However, generating Hamiltonians with
further improvement would seem exceedingly difficult. This is because
one would need to start from a Lüscher-Weisz improved action with
non-planar terms Lüscher and Weisz ( 1985 ) . For this reason we propose
a move to the direct approach. That is, to construct improved
Hamiltonians directly by adding appropriate gauge invariant terms and
fixing their coefficients so that errors are cancelled.

Tadpole improvement has been studied briefly in the Hamiltonian approach
Luo et al. ( 1999 ); Fang et al. ( 2000 ) . However there has been some
disagreement between possible implementations. Other forms of quantum
improvement have not yet been considered in detail in Hamiltonian LGT.

In this chapter we derive the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian for gluons and
develop a technique for constructing improved Hamiltonians directly.
This approach is in the spirit of the original Kogut-Susskind derivation
and parallels the strategies used for constructing improved actions. For
simplicity we will not consider quarks at this stage.

### 12 The Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian

#### 12.1 Preliminaries

In this section we derive the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian for pure SU(
@xmath ) gauge theory in @xmath +1 dimensions. We maintain a continuous
time coordinate and work on a @xmath dimensional spatial lattice.

We start with the formal continuum Hamiltonian operator expressed in
terms of the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields:

The space-like components of the continuum chromomagnetic field are
given in terms of the space-like components of the field strength
tensor, @xmath , by

     @xmath      (10)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the Dirac index labelling the space-like directions and
summation over repeated indices is understood. @xmath is the totally
antisymmetric Levi-Civita tensor defined to be 1 if @xmath is an even
permutation of @xmath , @xmath if it is an odd permutation and 0
otherwise (i.e. if an index is repeated). The field strength tensor is
given in terms of the continuum gluon field, @xmath , by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (11)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the QCD coupling.

The chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields can each be expressed in
terms of their colour components as follows,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (12)
  -- -------- -- ------

Here @xmath is a basis for SU( @xmath ). It is common to use the
Gell-Mann basis, in which case @xmath , where @xmath is the set of
traceless @xmath Gell-Mann matrices. It is conventional to normalise the
basis as follows,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (13)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

so that Eq. ( 12 ) can be inverted to write the colour components of the
chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields as,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (14)
  -- -------- -- ------

A final relation that is of use in this chapter is the commutation
relation,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (15)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

where the @xmath are the totally antisymmetric, real structure constants
for SU( @xmath ).

#### 12.2 Errors in Lattice Gauge Theory

Before discussing Hamiltonian improvement we must first understand how
deviations between LGT and its continuum counterpart arise. The
deviations can be separated into two classes, classical and quantum
errors, which will be described in what follows. We start with classical
errors.

Rather than being constructed from gluon fields, pure gauge theory on
the lattice is built from link operators

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (16)
  -- -------- -- ------

Here @xmath is the dimensionful QCD coupling, @xmath labels the link in
question and @xmath is the lattice gluon field on the link @xmath . In
what follows we will adopt the convention of writing the lattice version
of a continuum quantity in a calligraphic typeface. We define the
lattice gluon field on link @xmath to be the average continuum gluon
field @xmath along link @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (17)
  -- -------- -- ------

The definitions of Eqs. ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) lead to the diagrammatic
representation of the link operator shown in Fig. 1 .

In practice the lattice gluon field is defined at only one point on or
nearby a link. This leads to interpolation errors in the integral in
Eq. ( 17 ). For example, by choosing to evaluate the gluon field at ,
the midpoint of the link, we have,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (18)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is a unit vector in the direction of link @xmath . The
interpolation errors can be obtained by expanding in a Taylor series as
follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (19)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

We see that the lattice gluon field reduces to its continuum counterpart
in the @xmath limit, but that they differ by interpolation errors of
order @xmath . From Eq. ( 19 ) we build the sequence of approximations
to the lattice gluon field:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (20)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath               
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

Having discussed classical errors we now move on to the more difficult
topic of quantum errors in LGT. Quantum errors arise in LGT in two
different contexts. Firstly, the lattice acts as an ultraviolet
regulator allowing the simulation of only those states with momenta less
than @xmath . The absence of high momentum states results in a deviation
between the lattice and continuum theories. Secondly, non-physical
interactions arise due to the use of the link operator in constructing
the lattice theory. To demonstrate this we expand the link operator in
powers of @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (21)
  -- -------- -- ------

and note that the interaction of any number of gluons is allowed.
Naively, the unphysical interactions are suppressed by powers of @xmath
. However, when contracted, products of pairs of gluon fields produce
ultraviolet divergences ( @xmath ) which exactly cancel the @xmath
dependence of the expansion. These terms can be uncomfortably large and
result in what are known as tadpole errors.

In the last decade the improvement programme has led to a good
understanding of both classical and quantum errors in quark and gluon
actions (See Ref. Lepage ( 1996 ) and references within). In contrast,
only the lowest order classical errors have been corrected in the
Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian. Conjectures have been made about the
structure of a quantum improved Hamiltonian Luo et al. ( 1999 ) , but a
perturbative study, which would be needed to fix its precise form, has
not yet been carried out.

We describe how tadpole improved lattice Hamiltonians can be constructed
in Section 14 .

#### 12.3 Gauge Invariance on the Lattice

Under a local gauge transformation, @xmath , the link operator, @xmath ,
transforms as follows,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (22)
  -- -------- -- ------

Consider the closed path, @xmath , on the lattice consisting of links
@xmath , @xmath . The ordered product of link operators along @xmath is
given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (23)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

Making use of Eq. ( 22 ), under a local gauge transformation @xmath we
have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (24)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

Since the trace of a matrix does not depend on the choice of
representation (i.e. @xmath ), by taking the trace of @xmath we obtain a
gauge invariant operator. The traces of closed loops are known as Wilson
loops and are the building blocks of LGT. The simplest Wilson loop on
the lattice is called the plaquette. It is the trace of the ordered
product of link operators around a square of side length @xmath . Using
different combinations of Wilson loops one can construct lattice
theories which have different approaches to the continuum limit.

#### 12.4 Commutation Relations

In continuum gauge theory, when employing canonical quantisation the
following equal time commutation relations are postulated,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (25)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

When constructing a lattice Hamiltonian the building blocks should be
related in such a way that the correct continuum commutation relations
are restored in the limit of zero lattice spacing. To construct the
corresponding commutation relations on the lattice we need to use the
lattice chromoelectric field, @xmath , and the link operator, @xmath .
While we can determine the continuum behavior of the link operator with
a simple Taylor expansion about @xmath , the requirement that the
correct continuum commutation relations be restored as @xmath defines
the relationship between the lattice and continuum chromoelectric
fields.

Let us now consider the commutation relations between the lattice
chromoelectric field and the link operator,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (26)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

Making use of the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula for @xmath matrices
@xmath and @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (27)
  -- -------- -- ------

and Eq. ( 20 ) gives to lowest order in @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (28)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

Here @xmath is the link @xmath . In order to produce the correct
continuum limit commutation relations, the lattice electric field must
be proportional its continuum counterpart to lowest order in @xmath ;

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (29)
  -- -------- -- ------

Here @xmath is the link @xmath and @xmath is a constant which we now
determine. Substituting Eq. ( 29 ) in Eq. ( 28 ) and using the continuum
commutation relations Eq. ( 25 ) gives

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (30)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

In the last line we have related the discrete and continuous delta
functions by @xmath in the small @xmath limit. We set @xmath so that the
commutation relations between the lattice chromoelectric field and the
link operator do not depend on either the coupling or the lattice
spacing. This leads to,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (31)
  -- -------- -- ------

and the conventional commutation relation,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (32)
  -- -------- -- ------

Proceeding exactly as above, or simply by pre and post-multiplying both
sides of Eq. ( 32 ) by @xmath , we can show that the analogous
commutation relation for @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (33)
  -- -------- -- ------

#### 12.5 The Kinetic Hamiltonian

Using Eq. ( 31 ) we see that the kinetic part of a lattice Hamiltonian
with order @xmath errors can be defined as follows

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (34)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

By comparison with the kinetic part of the continuum Hamiltonian of
Eq. ( 9 ), it is clear that Eq. ( 34 ) has the correct form in @xmath
limit. To show this we substitute Eq. ( 31 ) in Eq. ( 34 ) which leads
to,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (35)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

Here, in the small @xmath limit, we have replaced the sum over by a
@xmath dimensional integral. This is the correct continuum limit kinetic
Hamiltonian up to order @xmath corrections. Since the Hamiltonian has
dimensions of mass, from Eq. ( 34 ) we see that in @xmath dimensions the
coupling constant, @xmath , has units of @xmath . Thus, in 2+1
dimensions the coupling constant has dimensions of mass and in 3+1
dimensions it is dimensionless. We can define a dimensionless coupling
by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (36)
  -- -------- -- ------

In terms of the dimensionless coupling the kinetic Hamiltonian is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (37)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

#### 12.6 The Potential Term

We have seen in Section 12.3 that gauge invariant operators on the
lattice are built from the traces of products of link operators around
closed loops. The simplest loop, the square of side length @xmath is
called the plaquette. Consider a plaquette which joins the lattice sites
, @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . We define the plaquette operator on such
a plaquette by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (38)
  -- -------- -- ------

We will often use the equivalent pictorial expression to condense
notation:

  -- -- -- ------
           (39)
  -- -- -- ------

The directed square denotes the traced ordered product of link
operators, starting with @xmath , around an elementary square, or
plaquette, of the lattice,

  -- -- -- ------
           (40)
  -- -- -- ------

The reason for choosing the particular form of Eq. ( 39 ) for the
plaquette operator, @xmath , becomes obvious once we expand it in powers
of @xmath . Making use of the definition of the link operator (Eq. ( 16
)) and Stokes’ theorem we have,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (41)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

Expanding the exponential in the above and expanding @xmath in a Taylor
series in @xmath leads to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (42)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

Here @xmath is the gauge covariant derivative. The potential term of a
lattice Hamiltonian with order @xmath corrections is thus given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (43)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

To see this we make use of Eq. ( 42 ) to give

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (44)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

The last line follows simply from the definition of the chromomagnetic
field in Eq. ( 10 ).

Combining the kinetic and potential parts (Eqs. ( 37 ) and ( 43 )
respectively) leads to the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (45)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

which has the correct continuum form up to order @xmath corrections.

### 13 Classically Improved Hamiltonians

#### 13.1 Introduction

In this section we derive a classically improved Hamiltonian directly by
adding additional gauge invariant terms and fixing their coefficients in
order to cancel errors. As a first step we aim to correct the classical
order @xmath errors arising in the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian of Eq. (
45 ). We treat the kinetic and potential terms of the Hamiltonian
separately. We start with the potential term.

#### 13.2 Improving the Potential Term

To improve the potential term of the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian, we
follow the process of improving the Wilson action. We introduce the
rectangle operator @xmath in the @xmath - @xmath plane (with the long
side in the @xmath direction),

  -- -- -- ------
           (46)
  -- -- -- ------

Here the Wilson loop joins the lattice sites , @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath . Following the procedure of the previous section we can expand
the rectangle operator in powers of the lattice spacing as follows

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (47)
  -- -------- -- ------

We see that the expansion of @xmath gives precisely the same terms as
the expansion of @xmath in Eq. ( 42 ), but weighted differently. This
allows us to take a linear combination of @xmath and @xmath and fix the
coefficients so that the order @xmath errors cancel. We write the
improved potential term as the linear combination

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (48)
  -- -------- -- ------

Substituting Eqs. ( 42 ) and ( 47 ) into Eq. ( 48 ) we have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (49)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

In order to obtain the correct continuum limit we must have @xmath and
to cancel the order @xmath error we require @xmath . Solving
simultaneously gives @xmath and @xmath . This leads to the improved
potential term

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (50)
  -- -------- -- ------

In principle, the next lowest order classical errors could be corrected
by including additional, more complicated Wilson loops in the potential
term. This has not been done because many additional diagrams are
required to cancel the large number of order @xmath error terms. Since
these errors are overwhelmed by order @xmath quantum errors in the
Lagrangian approach, addressing quantum corrections in the Hamiltonian
approach would seem to be of more immediate importance.

#### 13.3 Improving the Kinetic Term

Constructing an improved kinetic Hamiltonian with a finite number of
terms has proven to be a nontrivial exercise. Luo, Guo, Kröger and
Schütte demonstrated an interesting trade off when using either the
transfer matrix or Legendre transformation methods to derive an improved
Hamiltonian Luo et al. ( 1999 ) . Both techniques require the starting
point to be an improved action. When one starts from an improved action
incorporating rectangular terms the resulting Hamiltonian has infinitely
many terms and couples links which are arbitrarily far apart. To produce
a Hamiltonian which couples only nearest neighbour links, it was found
necessary to start from a carefully constructed highly non-local
improved action.

Here we demonstrate an alternative approach, similar in nature to the
classical improvement of the potential term in the previous section. One
only needs to include additional gauge invariant terms with appropriate
continuum behaviour in the kinetic Hamiltonian. The coefficients of the
additional terms are chosen so that the order @xmath errors vanish.

Perhaps the most important property of the electric field is that it
generates group transformations. Mathematically, this translates to the
lattice electric fields and link operators satisfying the commutation
relations given by Eqs. ( 32 ) and ( 33 ). It is desirable for these to
hold on the lattice for any degree of approximation. Let us consider
what happens to these commutation relations for the approximation
labelled by the superscript (1) in Eq. ( 20 ). Making use of the
Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula (Eq. ( 27 )) we have,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (51)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

We observe that if the lattice electric field is taken to be related to
the continuum electric field via Eq. ( 31 ), an order @xmath error
arises in the commutation relation. To cancel this error we set

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (52)
  -- -------- -- ------

We can take this to order @xmath by setting

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (53)
  -- -------- -- ------

In this way a sequence of approximations to the lattice electric field
in terms of the continuum electric field can be constructed.

Making use of these approximations we can analyse the classical errors
arising in the kinetic Hamiltonian. To cancel these errors we take the
approach of adding new terms and fixing their coefficients in order to
cancel the order @xmath error. We have a great deal of freedom in
choosing additional terms. They are restricted only by gauge invariance
and the need for an appropriate continuum limit.

To understand the construction of gauge invariant kinetic terms
involving the lattice electric field, it is important to recall that the
lattice electric field transforms as follows under a local gauge
transformation, @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (54)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

The response of the link operator to a gauge transformation is given in
Eq. ( 22 ). Consequently, the next most complicated gauge invariant
kinetic term we can construct (after @xmath ) couples nearest neighbour
electric fields:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (55)
  -- -------- -- ------

More complicated gauge invariant terms are easily constructed. One only
needs to couple electric fields on different links anywhere around a
closed loop. Consequently, generating Hamiltonians with higher degrees
of improvement would be seem to be more readily achieved within this
approach.

#### 13.4 Continuum Limits

In this section we examine the small @xmath limit of gauge invariant
lattice operators involving electric fields for possible use in the
kinetic term of the Hamiltonian.

We start with the simplest possible gauge invariant operator containing
lattice electric fields, the kinetic term of the Kogut-Susskind
Hamiltonian,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (56)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

Making use of Eq. ( 52 ) to express the lattice electric fields in terms
of their continuum counterparts gives

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (57)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

In the small @xmath limit we can replace the sum over with a @xmath
dimensional integral;

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (58)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

Eq. ( 58 ) quantifies the order @xmath discrepancy between the
Kogut-Susskind kinetic Hamiltonian and its continuum counterpart.

We now move on to the next most complicated term; one with nearest
neighbour correlations. Let us consider the small @xmath limit of the
term

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (59)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

Assuming an infinite lattice we can shift the summation variable by any
finite number of lattice sites without changing the result:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (60)
                                @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

Here we have used the definition of @xmath (Eq. ( 16 )) and the
Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff identity (Eq. ( 27 )). Making use of the
totally antisymmetric SU( @xmath ) structure constants, @xmath , defined
in Eq. ( 15 ), and the relation @xmath , we expand @xmath in @xmath
keeping the lowest order terms to give

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (61)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

Here we have made use of the antisymmetry of the structure constants. We
now expand the lattice chromoelectric fields in powers of @xmath to
obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (62)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

The final step is to express the lattice electric fields in terms of
their continuum counterparts. Let us work to order @xmath so that @xmath
. Substituting Eq. ( 52 ) in Eq. ( 62 ) gives

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (63)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

It should be pointed out that while the Kogut-Susskind and nearest
neighbour kinetic terms both produce the correct continuum limit with
order @xmath classical corrections, the nearest neighbour term
introduces a new quantum error of order @xmath . We briefly discuss
quantum errors in Section 16 .

#### 13.5 The Improved Kinetic Term

Having derived the small @xmath expansions of the two simplest gauge
invariant kinetic terms we can form a linear combination of them and
choose the coefficients so that the correct continuum limit is obtained
and the order @xmath classical error vanishes. Incorporating nearest
neighbour interactions leads to the simplest improved kinetic
Hamiltonian:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (64)
  -- -------- -- ------

Substituting the small @xmath expansions from Eqs. ( 58 ) and ( 63 )
into this linear combination we obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (65)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

To obtain the correct continuum limit we must set @xmath . To cancel the
order @xmath error we require @xmath . Solving these equations
simultaneously gives @xmath and @xmath . Substituting back into Eq. ( 64
) results in the order @xmath improved kinetic Hamiltonian,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (66)
  -- -------- -- ------

This is the result of Luo, Guo, Kröger and Schütte Luo et al. ( 1999 ) .
We can take the this to order @xmath by including next nearest neighbour
interactions. A similar calculation using @xmath from Eq. ( 53 ) gives

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (67)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

Combining Eqs. ( 66 ) and ( 50 ) leads to the simplest classically
improved lattice Hamiltonian devoid of @xmath errors,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (68)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

### 14 Tadpole Improvement

Tadpole improvement is an important step in producing more
continuum-like actions in LGT. Its implementation for pure glue on both
isotropic and anisotropic lattices is well known in the Lagrangian
approach. When tadpole improvement is included agreement between Monte
Carlo and perturbative calculations on the lattice is achieved Lepage (
1996 ) .

Tadpole improvement in the Lagrangian formulation is carried out at
tree-level simply by replacing all link operators, @xmath , by the
tadpole improved link operator, @xmath , where @xmath is the mean link
operator. The scheme was developed a decade ago by Lepage and Mackenzie
Lepage and Mackenzie ( 1993 ) .

In the Hamiltonian formulation the implementation of tadpole improvement
in the potential term follows the procedure in the action approach; all
links are divided by the mean link. However for the kinetic term two
conflicting implementations have been suggested. The earliest starts
from a tadpole improved action and carries factors of @xmath into the
Hamiltonian Luo et al. ( 1999 ) . More recently it was suggested that no
tadpole improvement was necessary in the kinetic term of the improved
Hamiltonian Fang et al. ( 2000 ) . Here we present our own views on the
correct implementation.

In the Hamiltonian approach the question of whether the lattice electric
field should be rescaled under tadpole improvement arises. This question
is easily answered by considering the commutation relations between the
link operator and electric field:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (69)
  -- -------- -- ------

We see that if we divide all link operators by @xmath we have

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (70)
  -- -------- -- ------

We observe that the lattice electric field cannot be rescaled and still
maintain the correct commutation relations. Thus under tadpole
improvement the electric field cannot change. We must, however, divide
the second of the kinetic terms by a factor of @xmath . Tadpoles arise
in this term because the chromoelectric and gluon fields do not commute.

Including tadpole improvement in Eqs. ( 50 ) and ( 66 ) leads to the
simplest order @xmath tadpole improved Hamiltonian:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (71)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

Here, the tadpole improved plaquette and rectangle operators are defined
as follows

  -- -------- -------- -- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath         
     @xmath   @xmath         (72)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- ------

### 15 Additional Improved Hamiltonians

In this section we use the direct method to calculate improved
Hamiltonians coupling arbitrarily distant lattice sites in both the
kinetic and potential terms. Such Hamiltonians may be of use in
calculations where vacuum wave functions with long distance correlations
are used. Such wave functions are used in coupled cluster calculations
of glueball masses. It is possible that more accurate calculations of
high mass excited states may be obtained using such extended
Hamiltonians. Again we consider the kinetic and potential terms
separately. We start with the potential term.

For the potential term we will couple lattice sites that are separated
by, at most, @xmath links. Consider the extended rectangle operator,

  -- -------- -------- -- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath         (73)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- ------

Here the rectangular Wilson loop is a @xmath rectangle joining the
lattice sites , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . We can follow the procedure
of the last section to calculate the small @xmath expansion of @xmath .
After some algebra, the procedure of Section 12.6 leads to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (74)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

We can build an improved potential term as in the previous section by
taking an appropriate linear combination of plaquette and extended
rectangle operators. Let such an improved potential term be defined by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (75)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

Substituting the small @xmath expansions from Eqs. ( 74 ) and ( 42 )
gives

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (76)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

We see that in order to obtain the correct continuum limit and cancel
the order @xmath corrections we must have

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Solving these equations simultaneously results in

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (77)
  -- -------- -- ------

Substituting these values in Eq. ( 75 ) leads to the order @xmath
improved potential term

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (78)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

We note that the result for the simplest improved potential term given
by Eq. ( 50 ) is obtained by setting @xmath .

We can construct an extended kinetic term in a similar fashion. In the
kinetic term we couple lattice sites that are separated by, at most,
@xmath links. We start by considering the small @xmath behaviour of the
extended kinetic operator,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (79)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

Here we have introduced the following notation for the path ordered
product of link operators joining sites and @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (80)
  -- -------- -- ------

The small @xmath expansion of @xmath can be determined using the
procedure of Section 13.4 . After some algebra we arrive at

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (81)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

We define the extended improved kinetic Hamiltonian by taking the
following linear combination of the standard Kogut-Susskind kinetic term
and the extended kinetic term @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (82)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

Again we fix the constants @xmath and @xmath to produce the correct
continuum result and cancel the order @xmath correction term.
Substituting the small @xmath expansions from Eqs. ( 57 ) and ( 81 )
into Eq. ( 82 ) gives the following:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (83)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

To obtain the correct continuum limit and cancel the order @xmath error
term we set

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (84)
  -- -------- -- ------

Substituting in Eq. ( 82 ) we obtain the following extended improved
kinetic term

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (85)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

We notice the result for the simplest improved kinetic term is recovered
by setting @xmath .

Combining Eqs. ( 85 ) and ( 78 ) leads to the classically improved
Hamiltonian coupling lattice sites, at most, @xmath -links apart in the
kinetic term and, at most, @xmath -links apart in the potential term,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (86)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

It should be pointed out here that Luo, Guo, Kröger and Schütte derived
an improved Hamiltonian Luo et al. ( 1999 ) with a kinetic term which is
a sum over @xmath of @xmath .

Having calculated some examples of classically improved Hamiltonians we
now move on to briefly discuss the more difficult topic of quantum
improvement.

### 16 Quantum Errors

The correction of quantum errors has been instrumental in the progress
of Lagrangian LGT. While classically improved actions are built from
linear combinations of traced Wilson loops with the constant
coefficients chosen to cancel leading order @xmath errors, quantum
improved actions determine the coefficients to one-loop order giving
them a @xmath dependence. A method for determining these coefficients in
weak coupling perturbation theory was developed by Lüscher and Weisz
Lüscher and Weisz ( 1985 ) . Unable to find sufficient conditions in the
physical theory, Lüscher and Weisz considered the situation where two
dimensions are compactified and the gauge field obeys twisted periodic
boundary conditions. This mechanism, familiar from Kaluza-Klein
theories, gives the gluons mass and provides many simple on-shell
quantities for the study of quantum improved actions. For the purpose of
calculating the coefficients of a quantum improved action at the
one-loop level, Lüscher and Weisz used the masses of the asymptotic
gluon states and some simple scattering amplitudes. The result of their
SU(3) calculation in 3+1 dimensions, with errors starting at @xmath , is
termed the Lüscher-Weisz improved action,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (87)
  -- -------- -- ------

with

  -- -------- -------- -- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath         
     @xmath   @xmath         (88)
     @xmath   @xmath         
  -- -------- -------- -- -- ------

The classically improved action is recovered from Eq. ( 87 ) by
modifying the coefficients so that only the order @xmath terms remain.
It is important to note that since the coefficient of @xmath is small, a
quantum improved action is obtained, to good approximation, by keeping
only plaquette and rectangular terms. The tadpole improvement of the
Lüscher-Weisz action at the one-loop level, which we do not discuss
here, is straightforward Alford et al. ( 1995a ) . A convincing
demonstration of improvement using the tadpole improved Lüscher-Weisz
action was first shown in the restoration of rotational symmetry in the
@xmath potential Alford et al. ( 1995b ) .

In the Hamiltonian formulation quantum errors are yet to be considered
in detail. It would seem that their treatment would require considerable
effort. Luo, Guo, Kröger and Schütte have suggested a form for a quantum
improved Hamiltonian by taking the time-like lattice spacing to zero in
a quantum improved Lüscher-Weisz action, and then performing a Legendre
transformation Luo et al. ( 1999 ) . To extend their suggestion to a
precise form would require new perturbative calculations in the
Lagrangian approach in the @xmath limit ³ ³ 3 Here @xmath is the
time-like and @xmath the space-like lattice spacing. , possibly
following the techniques of Lüscher and Weisz described above. The
remaining step would be to relate the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian lattice
couplings. This could be done using the background field method,
extending the work of Hamer for the unimproved case Hamer ( 1996 ) , to
the improved case.

### 17 Conclusion

In this chapter we have introduced a direct method for the construction
of improved lattice Hamiltonians. This method differs from Legendre
transform and transfer matrix techniques in that one does not need to
start with a lattice Lagrangian. One simply needs to construct suitable
linear combinations of gauge invariant terms and fix their coefficients
so that the correct continuum limit is obtained to the desired level of
approximation. The advantage of the direct approach is that it can be
easily applied in the construction of various improved Hamiltonians, as
was demonstrated in Sections 13 and 15 . We have also discussed the
implementation of tadpole improvement within the Hamiltonian formulation
and how the construction of quantum improved Hamiltonians may be
possible.

The extension of the direct method to the construction of lattice
Hamiltonians for quarks and gluons is straightforward. One simply needs
to construct appropriate gauge invariant quark operators and form linear
combinations of them such that the correct continuum Hamiltonian is
obtained. The construction of quantum improved Hamiltonians is of more
immediate interest but their calculation seems to require significant
additional work.

Having constructed a variety of lattice Hamiltonians we now move on
testing the levels of improvement that they offer. In the next chapter
we introduce some simple tests of improvement. In Chapter \thechapter we
continue the discussion of improvement by employing classically improved
and tadpole improved Hamiltonians in the calculation of glueball masses.

## Chapter \thechapter Testing Improvement

### 18 Introduction

When performing a calculation on the lattice we are interested in the
continuum limit in which the lattice spacing is taken to zero. It is
only in this limit that physical results are obtained. For an improved
theory one would expect the presence of lattice artifacts to be less
pronounced, taking the lattice theory closer to continuum physics for a
given lattice spacing. Whether or not this is the case for the improved
Hamiltonians generated in Chapter \thechapter will become evident in
specific calculations.

In this chapter we perform some relatively simple checks on improvement.
The first check presented is for the simple case of U(1) gauge theory.
In this case we perform a perturbative calculation of the static
quark-antiquark potential in the strong coupling regime for both the
Kogut-Susskind and improved Hamiltonians. One would expect an improved
Hamiltonian to exhibit a break from the strong coupling limit at a
larger coupling, corresponding to a larger lattice spacing, than the
unimproved case. We demonstrate in Section 19 that this is indeed the
case.

The second check presented is a variational calculation of the lattice
specific heat for the case of SU(2) in 2+1 dimensions. For this case
analytic results for the integrals involved are known and have been used
in variational calculations for nearly 20 years. The peak in the lattice
specific heat has been shown to correspond to the transition region from
strong to weak coupling Horn et al. ( 1985 ) . One would expect the peak
of the improved lattice specific heat to be appear at a larger coupling
(corresponding to a larger lattice spacing) than its unimproved
counterpart. We demonstrate in Section 20 that this is in fact the case.

### 19 The U(1) Static Quark-Antiquark Potential

Without resorting to a detailed computation, a relatively
straightforward check on improvement can be made in a perturbative
calculation of the static quark-antiquark potential in the strong
coupling regime. We adopt the simplistic model of Kogut and Susskind
Kogut and Susskind ( 1975 ) and consider a source and a sink of colour
flux, each infinitely heavy, separated by @xmath lattice sites. The
potential existing between the quark and antiquark is described in terms
of a string of excited links joining the particles.

Consider the case of U(1) on a 3 dimensional spatial lattice with @xmath
links. The Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian is given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (89)
  -- -------- -- ------

In the strong coupling limit ( @xmath ) only the kinetic term survives.
In this limit the potential term can be treated as a perturbation whose
effect can be handled with standard Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation
theory. Before proceeding with the calculation, we first introduce the
Fock space of link excitations in which we intend to work.

We define the lattice vacuum by the direct product of all strong
coupling link vacuua:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (90)
  -- -------- -- ------

Here @xmath denotes the strong coupling vacuum of the @xmath -th link
upon which the action of the lattice electric field gives @xmath . An
excited link is defined by acting a link variable on the vacuum. For
example:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (91)
  -- -------- -- ------

Here the index @xmath is equivalent to the pair of indices (starting
point) and @xmath (direction) which label the link in the notation
@xmath . Employing the commutation relations between @xmath and @xmath
which, for the gauge group U(1), are given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (92)
  -- -------- -- ------

we see that excited link states are eigenstates of the strong coupling
Hamiltonian. In particular the energy associated with a singly excited
link is @xmath , and with a chain of @xmath links @xmath .

We now return to the calculation of the static quark-antiquark
potential. The lowest energy state is given by the direct line of flux
joining the source and sink with all links singly excited. Its energy is
given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (93)
  -- -------- -- ------

Making use of Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory to include the
effects of the potential term, the lowest order shifts in energy start
at order @xmath . Taking into account all possible contributions yields
the static quark-antiquark potential in 3+1 dimensions (relative to the
perturbed vacuum),

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (94)
  -- -------- -- ------

In 2+1 dimensions the perturbation is half the 3+1 dimensional result.
This is a result of there being only two possible orientations for a
plaquette sharing a link with a line of flux in 2+1 dimensions, whereas
in 3+1 dimensions there are four possible orientations. The 2+1
dimensional result is then

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (95)
  -- -------- -- ------

We can perform the same calculation with the classically improved
Hamiltonian, which for U(1) is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (96)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

The improved strong coupling ground state energy of the chain of @xmath
excited links is given by:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (97)
  -- -------- -- ------

The difference between this and the unimproved result arises because the
improvement term, @xmath , gives non-zero contributions only when acting
on pairs of adjacent excited links. Consequently, in a straight chain of
@xmath links there are only @xmath contributions from this term. This
difference vanishes however in the limit of large separation.

The calculation of the lowest order perturbation in the improved case is
considerably more complicated than the unimproved case. Including
rectangular Wilson loops in the potential term results in a large number
of contributions to the order @xmath shift. Collecting all contributions
leads to the improved static quark-antiquark potential (relative to the
perturbed vacuum),

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (98)
  -- -------- -- ------

The 2+1 dimensional result can be derived as above:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (99)
  -- -------- -- ------

We notice a large change in the magnitude of the first order
perturbation in going from the Kogut-Susskind to the improved lattice
Hamiltonian. In the limit of large separations we ignore the trailing
order @xmath terms which are independent of @xmath .

The string tension, @xmath , is defined as the coefficient of the linear
part of the quark-antiquark potential. It is a physical quantity and is
measurable, in principle, in deep inelastic scattering experiments. From
Eqs. ( 95 ) and ( 98 ) we obtain the Kogut-Susskind and classically
improved U(1) string tensions in 3+1 dimensions respectively,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (100)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (101)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Since it is a physical quantity, the string tension must have a finite
continuum limit. For this to be the case the coupling, @xmath , must
depend on the lattice spacing. Precisely how is determined by removing
the dependence of the string tension on @xmath by setting

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (102)
  -- -------- -- -------

This is known as the renormalisation group equation. It is usual to
describe the dependence of the coupling on the lattice spacing with the
Callan-Symanzik @xmath function, which, for Abelian gauge theories, we
define by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (103)
  -- -------- -- -------

The renormalisation group equation then allows us to write the @xmath
function in terms of the string tension as follows

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (104)
  -- -------- -- -------

With this result we can use Eqs. ( 100 ) and ( 101 ) to obtain the
Kogut-Susskind and improved @xmath functions shown in Fig. 3 ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (105)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (106)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

We can use this result to check the level of improvement offered by the
improved Hamiltonian. To do this we examine the break away from the
strong coupling limit, @xmath . One would expect a calculation using an
improved Hamiltonian to break away from the strong coupling limit at a
larger lattice spacing (or equivalently a larger coupling) than one
using an unimproved Hamiltonian. We see from Fig. 3 that this is indeed
the case.

To be more precise, suppose the break from the strong coupling limit
occurs at a coupling @xmath for the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian and
@xmath for the improved Hamiltonian. A relationship between @xmath and
@xmath can be deduced using Eqs. ( 105 ) and ( 106 ):

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (107)
  -- -------- -- -------

The same result is obtained, to this order, in 2+1 dimensions.

Having observed improvement in a simple strong coupling calculation for
pure U(1) gauge theory we now move on to a more detailed check on
improvement away from the strong coupling limit.

### 20 SU(2) Lattice Specific Heat in 2+1 Dimensions

#### 20.1 Introduction

In this section we calculate lattice specific heats using various
improved SU(2) Hamiltonians in 2+1 dimensions. We start with the
classically improved Hamiltonian given in Eq. ( 86 ), which couples
links, at most, @xmath lattice sites apart in the kinetic term, and
@xmath sites apart in the potential term. Following that we consider
tadpole improvement, discussing its practical implementation in the
Hamiltonian approach. Finally, we calculate the lattice specific heat
with the order @xmath classically improved kinetic term. A discussion of
the results follows.

#### 20.2 Preliminaries

Before proceeding with the calculation we need to make some preliminary
definitions. Consider for the time being SU( @xmath ) pure gauge theory
on a lattice with @xmath plaquettes. The lattice specific heat is
defined by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (108)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the inverse coupling, not to be confused with the
Callan-Symanzik @xmath function of Section 19 . From here on @xmath will
always denote the inverse coupling. The vacuum energy density, @xmath ,
is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (109)
  -- -------- -- -------

We compute the vacuum energy density variationally, using the
one-plaquette trial state,

  -- -- -- -------
           (110)
  -- -- -- -------

Here @xmath is the SU( @xmath ) analogue of the strong coupling vacuum
defined in Eq. ( 90 ). At this stage Eq. ( 109 ) defines the vacuum
energy density as a function of the coupling and the variational
parameter, @xmath . The variational parameter is fixed as a function of
the coupling by minimising the vacuum energy density at each coupling.
Using the commutation relations between @xmath and @xmath in Eqs. ( 32 )
and ( 33 ) the vacuum energy density can be expressed in terms of the
expectation values of the Wilson loops that appear in the Hamiltonian
under consideration. This can be done easily for all @xmath and any
number of dimensions. The difficulty lies in the calculation of the
expectation values themselves. There is no difficulty however for the
special case of SU(2) in 2+1 dimensions for which analytic results are
available.

With the necessary preliminary definitions made, we now proceed to the
calculation of lattice specific heats using a selection of the
Hamiltonians derived in Chapter \thechapter .

#### 20.3 The Extended Hamiltonian

In this section we calculate lattice specific heats for SU(2) LGT in 2+1
dimensions using the extended improved Hamiltonian @xmath of Eq. ( 86 ).
Let us denote the lattice specific heat calculated with @xmath by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (111)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the vacuum energy density is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (112)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here @xmath is the one-plaquette trial state of Eq. ( 110 ). Making use
of Eq. ( 328 ), after some algebra, @xmath can be expressed in terms of
the expectation values of plaquettes and extended rectangles as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath               (113)
                          @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -- -------- -------

For the special case of SU(2) in 2+1 dimensions, the expectation values
appearing in Eq. ( 113 ) can be evaluated analytically Arisue et al. (
1983 ); Arisue ( 1990 ) , with the result,

  -- -- -------- -- -- -------
        @xmath         
        @xmath         (114)
  -- -- -------- -- -- -------

Here @xmath is the @xmath -th order modified Bessel function of the
first kind defined for integers @xmath by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (115)
  -- -------- -- -------

Making use of Eq. ( 114 ) in Eq. ( 113 ) gives the SU(2) improved vacuum
energy density in 2+1 dimensions,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (116)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

The result of Eq. ( 116 ) should be compared with the unimproved result
of Arisue, Kato and Fujiwara Arisue et al. ( 1983 ) , derived from the
Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (117)
  -- -------- -- -------

With an analytic expression for the energy density as a function of
@xmath in hand, the lattice specific heat may be calculated using Eq. (
111 ). We now consider the effect of varying the extent of the
correlations in the kinetic term and potential term separately. We start
with the kinetic term.

Fig. 4 shows a plot of the lattice specific heats @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath (those with 2 @xmath 1 rectangles in the potential term), as well
as the unimproved result. The location of the peak, @xmath , indicates
the crossover region between the strong and weak coupling regimes Horn
et al. ( 1985 ) . The graphs exhibit the behaviour expected from an
improved Hamiltonian. It is clear that for the improved Hamiltonians the
transition from strong to weak coupling occurs at a larger coupling
(smaller @xmath ), and hence a larger lattice spacing, than the
unimproved case. The approximate values of @xmath are: 0.8850 for the
unimproved case, 0.5955 ( @xmath ), 0.6391 ( @xmath ) and 0.6533 (
@xmath ). This implies that when using an improved Hamiltonian one is
closer to continuum physics when working at a given lattice spacing. It
should be noted that the degree of improvement, does not vary greatly
with @xmath . This is expected, since distant correlations in the
kinetic term will not contribute to the energy density unless equally
distant correlations are included in the trial state. For such
complicated trial states, Monte Carlo techniques are necessary to
calculate the required expectation values. Such calculations will not be
presented here. They are made difficult by very shallow minima in the
vacuum energy density Long et al. ( 1988 ) .

We now examine the dependence of improvement on the potential term. Fig.
5 shows a plot of the lattice specific heats @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
, as well as the unimproved result. Again, it is clear that for the
improved Hamiltonians, the transition from strong to weak coupling
occurs at a larger coupling (smaller @xmath ), and hence a larger
lattice spacing, than for the unimproved case. The values of @xmath are:
0.5955 ( @xmath ), 0.7133 ( @xmath ) and 0.7768 ( @xmath ). The degree
of improvement is best for @xmath and becomes worse as @xmath increases.
This is to be expected since the errors present in Eq. ( 76 ) are @xmath
, which is large for large @xmath . This suggests that there may be
limits on the utility of improved Hamiltonians which couple distant
lattice sites. It is clear that the degree of improvement is, by far,
more sensitive to varying the potential term than varying the kinetic
term with the chosen trial state.

Having examined classical improvement in the context of improved
Hamiltonians coupling distant lattice sites, we now move on to consider
the effect of tadpole improvement on the location of the lattice
specific heat peak.

#### 20.4 Tadpole Improvement

In this section we extend the work of Section 20.3 to consider tadpole
improved SU(2) LGT in 2+1 dimensions. As discussed in Section 14 ,
tadpole improvement is an important step in the improvement of LGT.
Tadpole errors arise when expectation values involving products of link
operators are taken. When contracted, products of gluon fields, @xmath ,
produce ultraviolet divergences. Such divergences spoil small @xmath
perturbation series, leading to inaccurate results in the continuum
limit. Lepage and Mackenzie demonstrated that tadpole errors are largely
cancelled by dividing each link operator by the mean link @xmath Lepage
and Mackenzie ( 1993 ) .

In this section we calculate the lattice specific heat using the
simplest tadpole improved Hamiltonian given by  Eq. ( 20.3 ). We define
the SU( @xmath ) mean link in terms of the mean plaquette as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath         (118)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- -------

In the Lagrangian formulation, the more difficult choice of fixing to
the Landau gauge and calculating the mean link directly is often used.
We choose to define the mean link in terms of the mean plaquette for
simplicity. In this case one does not need to perform a gauge fixing,
which would be difficult in the Hamiltonian approach.

To incorporate tadpole improvement in @xmath is straightforward. We
follow the prescription discussed in Section 14 in which all links are
divided by the mean link and the lattice electric field operators remain
unchanged. Making use of this prescription leads to the tadpole improved

where the tadpole improved plaquette operator is given by Eq. ( 72 ) and
the tadpole improved extended rectangle operator is defined by,

  -- -------- -------- -- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath         (120)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- -------

Here the mean link is given by Eq. ( 118 ). Proceeding as in Section
20.3 we obtain the tadpole improved energy density,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (121)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Incorporating tadpole improvement in a variational calculation is not
straightforward. This is because the mean plaquette depends on the
variational state, which is determined by minimising the energy density.
The energy density however depends on the mean plaquette. Such
interdependence suggests the use of an iterative procedure for the
calculation of the energy density. The approach we adopt is as follows.
For a given @xmath and starting value of @xmath we minimise the energy
density of Eq. ( 121 ) to fix the variational state, @xmath . We then
calculate a new mean plaquette value using this trial state and
substitute it in Eq. ( 121 ) to obtain a new expression for the energy
density which is then minimised. This process is iterated until
convergence is achieved, typically between five and ten iterations. The
result of the procedure for the simple case of @xmath , @xmath is shown
in Fig. 6 . For the purpose of comparison we also plot the unimproved
lattice specific heat and the most improved result of Section 20.3 . We
observe a greater level of improvement for the tadpole improved case (
@xmath ) than the order @xmath classically improved case ( @xmath ).

We now move on to consider the effect of incorporating order @xmath
classical improvement in the kinetic Hamiltonian.

#### 20.5 Classical Order Improvement

In this section we calculate the lattice specific heat using a
Hamiltonian with an order @xmath classically improved kinetic term with
next nearest neighbour interactions given in Eq. ( 67 ). For the
potential term we use the standard order @xmath improved result of Eq. (
50 ). Ideally we would use an order @xmath improved potential term so
that all terms were improved consistently to the same order. In
principle, such a potential term could be constructed by adding
appropriately chosen additional, more complicated operators to the order
@xmath potential term of Eq. ( 50 ). This will not be done here because
many additional operators are needed to cancel the large number of
contributions to the order @xmath error. Consequently in this section we
are not able to compare an order @xmath classically improved calculation
with its order @xmath equivalent. Instead we examine the effect of
incorporating easily calculated addtitional improvements in the kinetic
term of the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian.

Tadpole improvement is easily incorporated in the Hamiltonian described
in the preceding paragraph by dividing all links by the mean link and
leaving the lattice electric field operators unchanged as described in
Section 14 . Making use of this prescription leads to the Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (122)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

where the tadpole improved plaquette and rectangle operators are given
by Eq. ( 72 ). With this Hamiltonian we obtain the following tadpole
improved SU(2) energy density in 2+1 dimensions:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (123)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

The improved and tadpole improved lattice specific heats for this case
are shown in Fig. 7 along with the results of Section 20.4 for
comparison. Without tadpole improvement we observe that the case of
order @xmath improvement in the kinetic term ( @xmath ) displays
marginal improvement over the order @xmath improved case ( @xmath ).
Similarly small levels of improvement are achieved when tadpole
improvement is included ( @xmath ) compared to the order @xmath
classically improved result of Section 20.3 ( @xmath ). As mentioned in
Section 20.3 , such marginal improvement is expected, since the
one-plaquette trial state is not particularly sensitive to distant
correlations in the kinetic term. A trial state more sensitive to
distant correlations in the kinetic term would require larger Wilson
loops in its exponent.

#### 20.6 Conclusion

We have shown that the level of improvement offered by an improved
Hamiltonian does not depend significantly on the degree of separation of
the sites coupled in the kinetic term when using the one-plaquette trial
state of Eq. ( 110 ). The onset of weak coupling has been found to occur
at @xmath for each improved case, compared with @xmath for the
unimproved case. The tadpole improved Hamiltonian with order @xmath
improvement in the kinetic term produced a lattice specific heat peak at
the largest coupling which suggests that this Hamiltonian exhibits the
largest degree of improvement of those considered in this chapter.

The weak dependence on distant correlations in the kinetic Hamiltonian
is a result of only including plaquettes in the trial state. For such a
choice the calculation of all matrix elements encountered is analytic
but the improvement term does not explicitly contribute. This is because
the improvement term must act on an excitation of two neighbouring links
to produce a nonzero result. Such a configuration does not occur with
the plaquette trial state. If extended Wilson loops were included in the
trial state exponent one would expect significantly different results
for the dependence on separation in the kinetic term. One would expect
the dependence of the lattice specific heat peak on the separation in
the kinetic term to be significant until it matched the degree of
separation in the trial state. Beyond that one would again expect a weak
dependence.

To extend the calculation to more complicated trial states requires a
change in technique. The required matrix elements must be calculated
using Monte Carlo techniques as no analytic results are available.

### 21 Summary

In this chapter we have performed some simple calculations designed to
test the level of improvement offered by the improved Hamiltonians
constructed in Chapter \thechapter . In both a strong coupling
calculation of the U(1) string tension in 3+1 dimensions and a
variational calculation of the SU(2) lattice specific heat in 2+1
dimensions we have observed that improved Hamiltonians do in fact
provide improvement. By improvement we mean that when working at a given
lattice spacing (or coupling) we are closer to the continuum limit when
working with an improved Hamiltonian.

In Chapter \thechapter we return to the discussion of improvement. There
we make use of the simplest classical and tadpole improved Hamiltonians,
as well as the original Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian, in calculations of
SU( @xmath ) glueball masses in 2+1 dimensions. Before presenting these
calculations it is necessary to introduce the analytic techniques upon
which the calculations rely. These techniques do nothing more than allow
the calculation of expectation values of Wilson loops in 2+1 dimensions
for general SU( @xmath ).

## Chapter \thechapter Analytic Techniques in Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge
Theory

### 22 Introduction

In Chapter \thechapter it was shown that when working with the
one-plaquette trial state of Eq. ( 110 ) the vacuum energy density can
be expressed in terms of expectation values of plaquettes and
rectangles. In principle, this allows the variational parameter, @xmath
, to be fixed as a function of @xmath in any number of dimensions and
for any gauge group. The difficulty lies in the calculation of the
plaquette and rectangle expectation values. Monte Carlo simulations can
be used to calculate these expectation values in any number of
dimensions and for any gauge group. However, in 2+1 dimensions it is
possible to calculate such expectation values analytically.

In this chapter we develop techniques which allow the analytic
calculation of various expectation values in 2+1 dimensions for SU(
@xmath ) gauge theory, extending the long known analytic results for
SU(2) to SU( @xmath ). Analytic expressions are obtainable in 2+1
dimensions because the change of variables from links to plaquettes has
unit Jacobian Batrouni and Halpern ( 1984 ) . Consequently, the
plaquettes on a 2 dimensional spatial lattice are independent variables.
For the case of 3+1 dimensions the same change of variables produces a
complicated Jacobian, which seems only manageable on special lattices.
The problems faced in 3+1 dimensional Hamiltonian LGT are discussed in
Chapter \thechapter .

Our motivation for considering SU( @xmath ) expectation values is in
their use for calculating general SU( @xmath ) glueball masses and in
particular examining their large @xmath limit. This limit is of current
interest due to a proposed correspondence between certain string
theories and large @xmath gauge theory. This correspondence was first
conjectured by Maldacena for supersymmetric gauge theories Maldacena (
1998 ) and later extended by Witten to pure SU( @xmath ) gauge theories
Witten ( 1998 ) . The Maldacena conjecture and the role of large @xmath
glueball masses are discussed further in Section 34 .

The outline of this chapter is as follows. In Section 23 we consider the
special cases of SU(2), for which analytic results have been known and
used for many years, and SU(3), for which we rediscover a useful
generating function. In Section 24 we calculate three generating
functions for general SU( @xmath ) which provide analytic results for
the expectation values that appear in calculations of glueball masses.
We finish the chapter in Section 25 with a summary of the results
obtained.

### 23 Analytic Techniques for SU(2) and SU(3)

In this section we discuss analytic techniques for use in the
calculation of group integrals for the special cases of SU(2) and SU(3).
Before deriving the generating functions which are useful in the
calculation of SU(2) and SU(3) expectation values, the concept of group
integration needs to be introduced. To do this we consider the
expectation value of a plaquette with respect to the one plaquette trial
state of Eq. ( 110 ). We can write this expectation value as an SU(
@xmath ) group integral as follows:

  -- -- -------- -- -- -------
        @xmath         (124)
  -- -- -------- -- -- -------

Here the products over @xmath and @xmath extend over all links on the
lattice, while the products over @xmath and @xmath extend over all
plaquettes on the lattice. We introduce the notation @xmath to denote
the trace of plaquette @xmath . For each integral in Eq. ( 124 ) the
integration measure is given by the Haar measure (also called the
invariant measure and less commonly the Hurwitz measure) Montvay and
Münster ( 1994 ); Creutz ( 1983 ) . For any compact group @xmath , the
Haar measure is the unique measure @xmath on @xmath which is left and
right invariant,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (125)
  -- -------- -- -------

and normalised,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (126)
  -- -------- -- -------

In Eq. ( 125 ) @xmath is an arbitrary function over @xmath .

In 2+1 dimensions the variables in Eq. ( 124 ) can be changed from links
to plaquettes with unit Jacobian Batrouni and Halpern ( 1984 ) . The
plaquettes then become independent variables allowing the cancellation
of all but one group integral in Eq. ( 124 ). All that remains is

  -- -- -------- -------- -- -------
        @xmath   @xmath      (127)
  -- -- -------- -------- -- -------

Here, @xmath is a plaquette variable with @xmath . For the case of
SU(2), analytic expressions for the plaquette expectation value in terms
of modified Bessel functions (Eq. ( 114 )) have been used in variational
calculations for almost 20 years.

Integrals over SU(2) are easily handled using the parameterisation of
SU(2) Montvay and Münster ( 1994 ) ,

  -- -- -- -------
           (128)
  -- -- -- -------

where the parameters @xmath , @xmath and @xmath lie in the ranges @xmath
and @xmath . The Haar measure corresponding to this parameterisation is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (129)
  -- -------- -- -------

With this information it is straightforward to show,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (130)
  -- -------- -- -------

All SU(2) integrals of interest to us can be obtained from Eq. ( 130 )
by differentiating appropriately with respect to @xmath . For example

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (131)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (132)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Here we have used the following property of the modified Bessel function
under differentiation:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (133)
  -- -------- -- -------

The corresponding SU(3) results, which have not been used, to our
knowledge, in Hamiltonian LGT, follow simply from a paper of Eriksson,
Svartholm and Skagerstam Eriksson et al. ( 1981 ) , in which the SU(3)
integral,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (134)
  -- -------- -- -------

is calculated for arbitrary @xmath matrices @xmath . Following their
analysis, but treating @xmath and @xmath as independent variables, with
@xmath , @xmath , and @xmath the @xmath unit matrix, leads to an
expression for the SU(3) generating function:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (135)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Here @xmath is a closed contour in the complex plane including the pole
at @xmath but excluding the pole at @xmath and @xmath is the @xmath -th
order Bessel function of the first kind defined, for integers @xmath ,
by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (136)
  -- -------- -- -------

To evaluate the contour integral in Eq. ( 135 ) we expand the integrand
in power series about the pole at @xmath and use Cauchy’s integral
theorem to eventually obtain the following convergent series:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (137)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

This generating functional is extremely useful in the context of
Hamiltonian LGT. In principle, it permits an analytic investigation of
2+1 dimensional pure SU(3) gauge theory. The calculation of various
matrix elements for all couplings, reduces to a exercise in
differentiation. For example:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath               
     @xmath   @xmath               
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (138)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

As an application of Eq. ( 137 ) we can calculate the strong coupling
limit ( @xmath ) of @xmath . These integrals arise in coupled cluster
calculations Leonard ( 2001 ) . By differentiating Eq. ( 137 )
appropriately, we observe that non-zero strong coupling matrix elements
occur only when @xmath . For this case we have,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (139)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

where the sum runs over all integers @xmath . This strong coupling
result has an equivalent combinatorial interpretation as the number of
times the singlet representation appears in the direct product of @xmath
3 and @xmath @xmath representations Creutz ( 1983 ) . Although formulas
for the case of @xmath exist Gessel ( 1990 ); Stanley ( 1999 ) , we have
not seen a general expression for @xmath published elsewhere. These
numbers are well known in combinatorics and are related to the Kostka
numbers Sagan ( 2001 ) .

### 24 Analytic Results for SU( ) Integrals

#### 24.1 Introduction

Much work has been carried out on the topic of integration over the
classical compact groups. The subject has been studied in great depth in
the context of random matrices and combinatorics. Many analytic results
in terms of determinants are available for integrals of various
functions over unitary, orthogonal and symplectic groups Baik and Rains
( 2001 ) . Unfortunately similar results for SU( @xmath ) are not to our
knowledge available. The primary use of these integrals has been in the
study of Ulam’s problem concerning the distribution of the length of the
longest increasing subsequence in permutation groups Rains ( 1998 );
Widom et al. ( 2001 ) . Connections between random permutations and
Young tableaux Regev ( 1981 ) allow an interesting approach to
combinatorial problems involving Young tableaux. A problem of particular
interest is the counting of Young tableaux of bounded height Gessel (
1990 ) which is closely related to the problem of counting singlets in
product representations mentioned in Section 23 . Group integrals
similar to those needed in this thesis have also appeared in studies of
the distributions of the eigenvalues of random matrices Diaconis and
Shahshahani ( 1994 ); Widom and Tracy ( 1999 ) .

In the context of LGT not much has work been done in the last 20 years
on the subject of group integration. The last significant development
was due to Creutz who developed a diagrammatic technique for calculating
specific SU( @xmath ) integrals Creutz ( 1978 ) using link variables.
This technique allows strong coupling matrix elements to be calculated
for SU( @xmath ) Leonard ( 2001 ) and has more recently been used in the
loop formulation of quantum gravity where spin networks are of interest
De Pietri ( 1997 ); Rovelli and Smolin ( 1995 ); Ezawa ( 1997 ) .

In sections 24.2 , 24.4 and 24.3 we extend the results of Section 23 to
calculate a number of SU( @xmath ) integrals. As generating functions
these integrals allow the evaluation of all expectation values appearing
in variational calculations of SU( @xmath ) glueball masses in 2+1
dimensions. To calculate these generating functions we work with
plaquette variables and make use of techniques which have become
standard practice in the fields of random matrices and combinatorics. In
Section 24.2 we derive a generating function which allows the
calculation of integrals of the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (140)
  -- -------- -- -------

The work in Section 24.3 generalises the generating function of Section
24.2 allowing the calculation of more complicated integrals of the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (141)
  -- -------- -- -------

The third integral, which we calculate in Section 24.4 , while not
directly relevant to the calculation of massgaps here, is of importance
in the study of combinatorics. It allows the calculation of integrals of
the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (142)
  -- -------- -- -------

For each integral considered the approach is the same and proceeds as
follows. We start with a calculation of a U( @xmath ) integral. For
example in Section 24.2 we calculate

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (143)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

This is a generalisation of @xmath , an integral first calculated by
Kogut, Snow and Stone Kogut et al. ( 1982 ) . We then make use of a
result of Brower, Rossi and Tan Brower et al. ( 1981 ) to extend the U(
@xmath ) integral to SU( @xmath ) by building the restriction, @xmath
for all @xmath SU( @xmath ), into the integration measure. In this way
SU( @xmath ) generating functions can be obtained as sums of
determinants whose entries are modified Bessel functions of the first
kind.

#### 24.2 A Simple Integral

In this section we introduce a useful technique for performing SU(
@xmath ) integrals. We start with the U( @xmath ) integral of Eq. ( 143
) and calculate it using a technique which has become standard practice
in the study of random matrices and combinatorics.

Since the Haar measure is left and right invariant (see Eq. ( 125 )) we
can diagonalise @xmath inside the integral as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (144)
  -- -------- -- -------

In terms of the set of variables, @xmath , the Haar measure factors as
@xmath Kogut et al. ( 1982 ) . Since the integrand is independent of
@xmath , the @xmath integral can be carried out trivially using the
normalisation of the Haar measure given by Eq. ( 126 ).

Making use of the Weyl parameterisation for U( @xmath ) Weyl ( 1946 ) ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (145)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the Vandermonde determinant, with implicit sums over
repeated indices understood,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (146)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

we can express the U( @xmath ) generating function as follows

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (147)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Substituting Eq. ( 146 ) gives,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (148)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

To simplify this further we need an expression for the integral,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (149)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

which is easily handled by expanding the integrand in Taylor series in
@xmath and @xmath ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (150)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Making use of Eq. ( 150 ) in Eq. ( 148 ) gives an expression for @xmath
as a Toeplitz determinant ⁴ ⁴ 4 A Toeplitz determinant is defined as a
determinant of a matrix whose @xmath -th entry depends only on @xmath .
,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (151)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Here the quantities inside the determinant are to be interpreted as the
@xmath -th entry of an @xmath matrix. Now to calculate the corresponding
SU( @xmath ) result the restriction @xmath , which is equivalent to
@xmath in terms of the @xmath variables, must be built into the
integration measure. To do this we follow Brower, Rossi and Tan Brower
et al. ( 1981 ) and incorporate the following delta function in the
integrand of Eq. ( 147 ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (152)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

This is most conveniently introduced into the integral via its Fourier
transform,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (153)
  -- -------- -- -------

To obtain the SU( @xmath ) integral from the corresponding U( @xmath )
result the modification is therefore trivial. Including Eq. ( 153 ) in
the integrand of Eq. ( 147 ) leads to the general SU( @xmath ) result,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (154)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

This expression can be manipulated to factor the @xmath dependence out
of the determinant as follows,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (155)
                                @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Making use of this result in Eq. ( 154 ) leads to the SU( @xmath )
generating function,

  -- -------- -------- -- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath         (156)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- -------

For the case of SU(2) we can show that this reduces to the standard
result of Arisue given by Eq. ( 130 ). To do this we need the recurrence
relation for modified Bessel functions of the first kind,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (157)
  -- -------- -- -------

Recall that for SU(2) the Mandelstam constraint is @xmath , so the case
@xmath can be considered without loss of generality;

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (158)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Here we have used the standard addition formula Gradshteyn and Ryzhik (
1994 ) for modified Bessel functions. Employing the recurrence relation
of Eq. ( 157 ) gives

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (159)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

which is the standard result of Arisue given by Eq. ( 130 ).

With an analytic form for SU( @xmath ) in hand we can attempt to find
simpler expressions for @xmath analogous to Eq. ( 159 ). To our
knowledge no general formulas are available for the simplification of
the determinants appearing in Eq. ( 156 ). Without such formulas we can
resort to the crude method of analysing series expansions and comparing
them with known expansions of closed form expressions. Since the
determinants appearing in the generating function are nothing more than
products of modified Bessel functions we expect that if a closed form
expression for the general SU( @xmath ) generating function exists, it
will involve the generalised hypergeometric function. With this approach
we have limited success. The SU(3) result of Eq. ( 137 ) is recovered
numerically but the SU(4) result does simplify analytically.

When analysing the series expansion of @xmath we notice that it takes
the form of a generalised hypergeometric function. In particular we find
the following result:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (160)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Here the generalised hypergeometric function is defined by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (161)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the rising factorial or Pochhammer symbol. In addition
to Eq. ( 160 ) we find the following results for matrix elements derived
from the SU(4) generating function:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (162)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -------- -- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath         (163)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -------- -- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath         (164)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- -------

We stress that these results are nothing more than observations based on
series expansions. Despite some effort analogous expressions for @xmath
have not been found.

The generating functions, @xmath and @xmath , are not only of interest
in Hamiltonian LGT. By differentiating Eq. ( 156 ) appropriately with
respect to @xmath and @xmath and afterward setting @xmath and @xmath to
zero, we obtain the number of singlets in a given product representation
of SU( @xmath ). This was discussed for the special case of SU(3) in
Section 23 . We now consider the general case in the calculation of
@xmath ; the number of singlets in the SU( @xmath ) product
representation,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (165)
  -- -------- -- -------

As a group integral @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (166)
  -- -------- -- -------

Integrals of this kind are studied in combinatorics, in particular the
study of increasing subsequences of permutations. An increasing
subsequence is a sequences @xmath such that @xmath , where @xmath is a
permutation of @xmath . It has been shown that the number of
permutations @xmath of @xmath such that @xmath has no increasing
subsequence of length greater than @xmath is @xmath Rains ( 1998 ) . In
addition it is possible to prove that @xmath is the number of pairs of
Young tableaux of size @xmath and maximum height @xmath via the
Schensted correspondence van Moerbeke ( 2001 ); Rains ( 1998 ) .

Making use of Eq. ( 156 ) we see that only the @xmath term contributes
to @xmath . Letting @xmath we have:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (167)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Hence the generating function for @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (168)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

a result first deduced by Gessel Gessel ( 1990 ) . The first few @xmath
sequences are available as A072131, A072132, A072133 and A072167 in
Sloane’s on-line encyclopedia of integer sequences Sloane .

#### 24.3 A More Complicated Integral

We now move on to the more complicated integral

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (169)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

This integral is of interest as a generating function for the
calculation of integrals such as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (170)
  -- -------- -- -------

For the simple case of SU(3) we can use the Mandelstam constraint,
@xmath , to reduce such integrals to those obtainable from the
generating function of the previous section. However for higher
dimensional gauge groups not all trace variables can be written in terms
of @xmath and @xmath . For these gauge groups one must introduce the
generating function, @xmath , to calculate integrals similar to Eq. (
170 ).

To calculate @xmath we start with the corresponding U( @xmath )
generating function and follow the procedure of Section 24.2 to obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (171)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

To proceed we need the following integral,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (172)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Making use of Eq. ( 172 ) in Eq. ( 171 ) leads to the following
expression for the U( @xmath ) generating function,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (173)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

with

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (174)
  -- -------- -- -------

Extending to SU( @xmath ) following the prescription of Section 24.2 we
arrive at the corresponding SU( @xmath ) generating function,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (175)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

An example of an SU( @xmath ) integral derived from this generating
function is the following:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (176)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Only two terms need to be kept in the @xmath -sum of Eq. ( 174 ) here
because higher order powers of @xmath vanish when the derivative with
respect to @xmath is taken and @xmath set to zero.

#### 24.4 Another Integral

Another integral that is calculable using the procedure of Section 24.2
is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (177)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

We start with the corresponding @xmath integral and again use Weyl’s
parameterisation for U( @xmath ) to give

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (179)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

To simplify this further we need the following integral:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (180)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Making use of Eq. ( 180 ) in Eq. ( 179 ) leads to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (181)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

The corresponding SU( @xmath ) result is then

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (182)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Due to the form of @xmath the U( @xmath ) generating function simplifies
significantly for @xmath . For this case we have,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (183)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

since the only non-zero terms in the determinant occur when @xmath for
@xmath . We can make use of this result in the calculation of

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (184)
  -- -------- -- -------

a quantity which has been studied in the context of combinatorics Rains
( 1998 ) and random matrices Diaconis and Shahshahani ( 1994 ) . Making
use of our generating function we see that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (185)
  -- -------- -- -------

For the special case of @xmath we can make use of Eq. ( 183 ) to express
@xmath as the sum of squares of multinomial coefficients as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (186)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

With the help of Mathematica we can express @xmath with @xmath in terms
of sums of binomial coefficients for @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (187)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

We have not found similar expressions for @xmath .

A further exercise is to explore the large @xmath limit of the
generating function, @xmath . Let us expand @xmath , in the form of
Eq. ( 179 ), in @xmath and @xmath about @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (188)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

A result due to Diaconis and Shahshahani Diaconis and Shahshahani ( 1994
) ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (189)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

then allows us to access the large @xmath limit. In the @xmath limit,
for each term of the sum in Eq. ( 188 ) we have @xmath and hence, using
Eq. ( 189 ), we have,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (190)
  -- -------- -- -------

This result is consistent with the @xmath and @xmath case proved in Ref.
Baik and Rains ( 2001 ) ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (191)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is valid for all real @xmath .

For the case of @xmath , where @xmath , we also find an interesting
simplification for @xmath . In this case the determinant appearing in
Eq. ( 181 ) becomes a block determinant, which leads to the
simplification,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (192)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

This result is equivalent to @xmath .

### 25 Conclusion

In this chapter we have calculated a number of SU( @xmath ) group
integrals. As generating functions they allow the analytic calculation
of all expectation values that appear in variational calculations of SU(
@xmath ) glueball masses in 2+1 dimensional Hamiltonian LGT. Our
derivations have made use of techniques for the calculation of U( @xmath
) integrals which have become standard tools in the fields of random
matrices and combinatorics. The resulting generating functions
generalise the analytic results that have been available for SU(2) for
many years to the general case of SU( @xmath ).

The extension of the techniques presented here to 3+1 dimensions is
highly non-trivial. The starting point for all derivations presented in
this chapter was the fact that in 2+1 dimensions the transformation from
link to plaquette variables has unit Jacobian. This allows the matrix
elements of functions of plaquette variables to be calculated
analytically by differentiating a generating function appropriately. The
viability of applying analytic techniques in 3+1 dimensions is discussed
in Chapter \thechapter .

Having derived analytic results for a selection of SU( @xmath )
generating functions, in the next chapter we apply them in a variational
calculation of SU( @xmath ) glueball masses, with @xmath , 3, 4 and 5,
in 2+1 dimensions. The calculations make use of the simplest classically
improved and tadpole improved Hamiltonians derived in Chapter
\thechapter as well as the standard Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian.

## Chapter \thechapter Su( ) Massgaps in 2+1 Dimensions

### 26 Introduction

In this chapter we calculate the lowest lying glueball masses, or
massgaps, for SU( @xmath ) LGT in 2+1 dimensions, with @xmath , 3, 4 and
5. We use the Kogut-Susskind, classically improved and tadpole improved
Hamiltonians in their calculation and rely heavily upon the results of
the previous chapter for the calculation of the required expectation
values.

The outline of this chapter is as follows. After defining our notation
in Section 27 we fix the variational vacuum wave function in Section 28
. Following that we calculate lattice specific heats in Section 29
before studying SU( @xmath ) glueball masses in Section 30 . In Section
31 we present our results and compare them to similar calculations in
both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations. Section 32 contains a
discussion of further work and our conclusions.

### 27 Preliminaries

Before fixing the variational ground state we introduce the following
convenient notation. We define the general order @xmath improved lattice
Hamiltonian for pure SU( @xmath ) gauge theory,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (193)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

where the plaquette and rectangle operators are given in Eq. ( 72 ). The
simplest Hamiltonians derived in Chapter \thechapter can be expressed in
terms of @xmath as follows. The Kogut-Susskind (Eq. ( 45 )) and @xmath
classically improved (Eq. ( 68 )) Hamiltonians are given by @xmath and
@xmath respectively. The tadpole improved Hamiltonian (Eq. ( 71 )) is
given by @xmath , where @xmath is defined self-consistently as a
function of @xmath as described in Section 20.4 .

With this new notation the vacuum energy density is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (194)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

where the expectation values, as usual, are taken with respect to the
one-plaquette trial state defined in Eq. ( 110 ). The variational
parameter, @xmath , is fixed as a function of @xmath by minimising the
vacuum energy density. For the calculation of the expectation values we
use the generating functions of Chapter \thechapter with all infinite
sums truncated. Once the variational parameter is fixed the trial state
is completely defined as a function of @xmath .

### 28 Fixing the Variational Trial State

#### 28.1 Introduction

In this section we fix the SU( @xmath ) trial state for @xmath , making
use of the generating functions derived in Chapter \thechapter . These
generating functions allow the analytic calculation of the plaquette and
rectangle expectation values appearing in Eq. ( 194 ). The approach we
take follows Section 20.2 . For the Kogut-Susskind and classically
improved cases, we simply minimise @xmath for a given value of @xmath .
The value of @xmath at which @xmath takes its minimum defines @xmath as
a function of @xmath . The tadpole improved calculation is more
complicated because the mean plaquette, from which @xmath is calculated,
depends on the variational state, @xmath . To complicate matters, the
variational state in turn depends on the energy density and hence @xmath
. For this case we make use of the iterative technique procedure
introduced in Section 20.4 .

#### 28.2 Results

The results of the Kogut-Susskind, classically improved and tadpole
improved SU(2), SU(3), SU(4) and SU(5) vacuum energy density
calculations are shown in Fig. 8 . The corresponding variational
parameters, @xmath , are shown in Fig. 9 . For SU(3) the generating
function of Eq. ( 137 ) is used to calculate the required plaquette and
rectangle expectation values. The generating function of Eq. ( 156 ) is
used for SU(4) and SU(5).

The familiar strong and weak coupling behavior from variational
calculations is observed in each case. The differing gradients for the
improved and Kogut-Susskind variational parameters for a given @xmath in
the weak coupling limit highlight the fact that when using an improved
Hamiltonian one is using a different renormalisation scheme to the
unimproved case.

#### 28.3 Dependence on Truncation

In practice the @xmath -sum appearing in the SU(3) generating function
(Eq. ( 137 )) is truncated at a maximum value, @xmath . The dependence
of the variational parameter on various truncations of the @xmath -sum
is shown in Fig. 10 . We see that convergence is achieved up to @xmath
when keeping 20 terms. Further calculations show that when keeping 50
terms convergence up to @xmath is achieved.

The @xmath -sum appearing in the general SU( @xmath ) generating
function of Eq. ( 156 ) is also truncated in practice. We replace the
infinite sum over @xmath by a sum from @xmath to @xmath . The dependence
of the SU(3) and SU(4) variational parameters on @xmath is shown in Fig.
11 . From the graphs we see that convergence is achieved quickly as
@xmath increases for both SU(3) and SU(4). The results for @xmath are
barely distinguishable up to @xmath with the scale used in the plots.

### 29 Lattice Specific Heat

In addition to the vacuum energy density we can also calculate the
lattice specific heat defined in Eq. ( 108 ). The results for SU(2),
SU(3), SU(4) and SU(5) are shown in Fig. 12 . The SU(2) and SU(3)
results are calculated with the aid of Eqs. ( 130 ) and ( 137 ) with the
@xmath -sum of Eq. ( 137 ) truncated at @xmath . The SU(4) and SU(5)
results are obtained using Eq. ( 156 ) to calculate the required matrix
elements. For these cases the infinite @xmath -sum is truncated at
@xmath , for which the generating function has converged on the range of
couplings used. We recall from Chapter \thechapter that the location of
the peak indicates the region of transition from strong to weak
coupling. For an improved calculation one would expect the peak to be
located at a smaller @xmath (corresponding to a larger coupling) than
for the equivalent unimproved calculation. We see that this is indeed
the case for each example, with the tadpole improved Hamiltonian
demonstrating the largest degree of improvement.

### 30 Massgaps

#### 30.1 Introduction

Having fixed the one-plaquette vacuum wave function, in this section we
turn to investigating excited states. Our aim is to calculate the lowest
lying energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonians described by Eq. ( 193 )
for SU( @xmath ) with @xmath .

We follow Arisue Arisue ( 1990 ) and expand the excited state @xmath in
the basis consisting of all @xmath rectangular Wilson loops @xmath that
fit in a given square whose side length @xmath defines the order of the
calculation. Enumerating the possible overlaps between rectangular loops
is relatively simple and so a basis consisting of rectangular loops is
an ideal starting point. However, for an accurate picture of the
glueball spectrum we will need to extend the rectangular basis to
include additional smaller area loops. Without such small area
nonrectangular loops, it is possible that some of the lowest mass states
will not appear in the variational calculation described here. In order
to ensure the orthogonality of @xmath and @xmath we parameterise the
excited state as follows

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (195)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

with,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (196)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Here @xmath is the expectation value of @xmath with respect to the
ground state @xmath and the convenient label @xmath has been defined to
label the @xmath rectangular state, @xmath . We define the particular
form of @xmath to reflect the symmetry of the sector we wish to
consider. For SU( @xmath ) we take @xmath for the symmetric ( @xmath )
and antisymmetric ( @xmath ) sectors. To avoid over-decorated equations,
the particular @xmath in use is to be deduced from the context. Here
@xmath is the rectangular Wilson loop joining the lattice sites @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath , with

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (197)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here @xmath denotes the integer part of @xmath . In order to calculate
excited state energies we minimise the massgap (the difference between
the excited state and ground state energies) over the basis defined by a
particular order @xmath . To do this we again follow Arisue Arisue (
1990 ) and define the matrices

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (198)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the ground state energy, and

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (199)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Extending the calculation to the general improved Hamiltonian @xmath and
making use of Eqs. ( 337 — 340 ) from Appendix \thechapter gives

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (200)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

To minimise the massgap over a basis of a given order we make use of
following diagonalisation technique Tonkin ( 1987 ) . We first
diagonalise @xmath , with

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (201)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is diagonal. The @xmath -th lowest eigenvalue of the
modified Hamiltonian,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (202)
  -- -------- -- -------

then gives an estimate for the massgap corresponding to the @xmath -th
lowest eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian, @xmath .

#### 30.2 Classification of States

States constructed from only gluon degrees of freedom can be classified
in the continuum by their @xmath quantum numbers. In Section 7 we
discussed the assignment of @xmath and @xmath quantum numbers. In this
section we discuss the important topic of building states with
particular continuum spins on the lattice. Difficulties arise when the
continuous rotation group of the continuum is broken down to the group
of lattice rotations. The most serious difficulty to arise is an
ambiguity in the assignment of continuum spins to states built from
lattice operators. It is this ambiguity that we discuss in what follows.

Let us start with an eigenstate, @xmath , of the Hamiltonian. In the
continuum, following standard quantum mechanics, one can construct a
state with spin @xmath by taking the superposition

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (203)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the operator which rotates by an angle @xmath . This
follows from the fact that @xmath is the generator of rotations. On a
square lattice continuous rotations are not available. All rotations
must be modulo @xmath and so the lattice analogue of Eq. ( 203 ) is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (204)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here the state labelled @xmath is no longer a pure spin @xmath state. It
also includes states with spins @xmath since these spins produce the
same phases as @xmath on the square lattice as shown in Eq. ( 204 ). To
clarify this point continuum states with spin @xmath will couple to the
lattice state labelled @xmath . Thus we need to be careful when using
continuum terminology to label lattice wave functions.

To give a specific example, suppose we construct a wave function, @xmath
, on the lattice with lattice spin @xmath ; a state built from Wilson
loops which are unchanged by rotations of @xmath for all integers @xmath
. As explained above, this state is not a pure @xmath state; it also
contains @xmath states. Using a variational approach we can obtain
estimates of the lowest energy eigenvalues of states with lattice spin
@xmath . When the continuum limit is taken we obtain estimates of the
lowest continuum energy eigenvalues for the states with spin @xmath .

In the Lagrangian approach it is possible to suppress the unwanted spin
@xmath states in a given spin @xmath calculation. By “smearing” links,
one can confidently construct lattice states which do not couple with
the unwanted higher spin continuum states, at least for the lowest
energy eigenvalues Teper ( 1999 ) . The technique of “smearing” links
has not to our knowledge been applied in the Hamiltonian approach.

Another way to clarify ambiguities in spin assignment is to attempt to
construct a @xmath state on the lattice, devoid of @xmath contributions,
and similarly a @xmath state, devoid of unwanted @xmath contributions.
The construction of an exact @xmath state is impossible on a square
lattice due to the unavailability of @xmath rotations. One can however
attempt to construct states that are approximately symmetric under
rotations by @xmath . In the Lagrangian approach in 2+1 dimensions, it
has been demonstrated, for the simple case of SU(2), that such states
can be chosen on a square lattice and that the approximate @xmath
symmetry becomes exact in the continuum limit Johnson and Teper ( 1999 )
. This technique is readily applicable in the Hamiltonian approach but
has not yet been attempted.

Thus in our Hamiltonian calculation a lattice spin @xmath state will
correspond to a continuum state with spin @xmath . Using a variational
approach we can obtain estimates of the lowest mass states in the
continuum with these spin values. To improve the spin identification in
the continuum beyond modulo @xmath requires more work. Perhaps the
multiple scaling regions visible in our massgap calculations highlight
this ambiguity. Either way, it will prove interesting to compare the
masses calculated here to that of Teper who has been careful to identify
continuum spins correctly, at least for the lowest mass excitations.

#### 30.3 Calculating Matrix Elements

Having described the minimisation process we now detail the calculation
of the matrix elements @xmath and @xmath . Our aim is to reduce @xmath
and @xmath to polynomials of one plaquette matrix elements. This, again
has been done for the case of SU(2) by Arisue Arisue ( 1990 ) . Here we
retrace his calculations for the general case of SU( @xmath ) and extend
them to incorporate improved Hamiltonians. We start with @xmath .

Taking elementary plaquettes as our independent variables, it is easy to
show that the only non-zero contributions to @xmath occur when the
rectangles @xmath and @xmath overlap. As an example of a contribution to
@xmath , consider @xmath ; the case where @xmath plaquettes are
contained by both rectangles (these are the overlap plaquettes) and
@xmath plaquettes are contained by the rectangle @xmath . In order to
calculate such matrix elements we rely heavily on the orthogonality
properties of SU @xmath characters. We are interested in calculating SU
@xmath integrals of the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (205)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a SU @xmath plaquette variable and @xmath is a product
of any number of plaquettes not including @xmath . Here @xmath denotes
the character corresponding to the representation @xmath . For SU(2),
@xmath and for SU(3), @xmath where @xmath denotes the number of boxes in
the first row of the Young tableau describing the representation and
@xmath is the number of boxes in the second row. Similarly, for SU
@xmath , @xmath .

Performing a character expansion of the exponential in Eq. ( 205 )
gives:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (206)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

This is simply a generalisation of a Fourier expansion. Here, the
coefficient @xmath is given by:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (207)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now, using the orthogonality relation,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (208)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the dimension of the representation @xmath , we obtain:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (209)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

This result allows us to integrate out a single plaquette from an
extended Wilson loop in a given representation @xmath . To complete the
calculation we need to relate SU( @xmath ) characters to traces of group
elements. This can be done using Weyl’s character formula Bars ( 1980 )
. For SU( @xmath ), according to Bars Bars ( 1980 ) , the dimensions and
characters corresponding to the first few representations are given by:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (210)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here we have adopted the convention of dropping all zeros in the
character labels. The Mandelstam constraints for the gauge group in
question allows all characters to be expressed in terms of a minimal set
of trace variables. For example, for SU(3) we make use of the Mandelstam
constraint,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (211)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath is any @xmath matrix, to express all characters
in terms of @xmath and @xmath . For example, for the case of SU(3),
Eq. ( 210 ) simplifies to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (212)
  -- -------- -- -------

However, for general SU( @xmath ) the Mandelstam constraints are
difficult to calculate. In what follows we will need expressions for
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath as linear combinations of
characters for SU( @xmath ). It is possible to do this without the use
of the Mandelstam constraint. Such expressions are necessary in order to
make use of Eq. ( 209 ) in the calculation of expectation values of
trace variables. For @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath the necessary
expressions are easily obtained by rearranging Eq. ( 210 ),

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (213)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

To express the remaining expression, @xmath , as a linear combination of
characters is not as easily done. For SU(3) one can simply rearrange the
expression for @xmath in Eq. ( 212 ). For the general @xmath case it is
simplest to consider Young tableaux. In terms of Young tableaux we have

  -- -- -- -------
           (214)
  -- -- -- -------

Performing the product representation decomposition gives

  -- -------- -------- -- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath         (215)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- -------

Converting back into the notation of characters and traces gives

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (216)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Eq. ( 216 ) together with Eqs. ( 213 ) and ( 209 ) allow the analytic
calculation of each contribution to @xmath for all @xmath . For the case
of @xmath described earlier, we have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (217)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the character integrals are given by:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (218)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (219)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (220)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (221)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Here we have made use of the notation, @xmath , to denote the trace
variables occupying a single plaquette, @xmath . The expectation values
appearing in Eqs. ( 218 — 221 ) are easily expressed in terms of the
generating functions of Eqs. ( 156 ) and ( 175 ). Differentiating the
generating functions appropriately gives

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (222)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

In practice, we do not need to calculate all of these matrix elements.
We see from Eq. ( 154 ) that @xmath and @xmath are related by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (223)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

This follows from the fact that a group integral does not depend on the
choice of direction for the links. To be more precise, the result

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (224)
  -- -------- -- -------

follows from the fact that @xmath and @xmath each define invariant Haar
measures on SU( @xmath ) which, by uniqueness, must be equal.

We now move on to the calculation of @xmath . It is easy to show that
the only non-zero contributions occur when there is at least one common
link and an overlap between the rectangles. The improvement term (the
second term in Eq. ( 200 )) only contributes when the two rectangles
share at least two neighbouring links in a given direction. Consider the
contribution @xmath to @xmath in which there are @xmath common links and
@xmath common strings of two links in a given direction. Again we
suppose @xmath plaquettes are enclosed by rectangle @xmath and that
there are @xmath common plaquettes. Making use of Eq. ( 209 ) and Eqs. (
337 — 340 ) from Appendix \thechapter we obtain

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (225)
  -- -------- -- -------

with

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (226)
  -- -------- -- -------

For the case of SU(3) we can simplify this using Eq. ( 211 ) to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (227)
  -- -------- -- -------

Having determined individual contributions to @xmath and @xmath , to
complete their calculation the possible overlaps between states @xmath
and @xmath of a given type must be counted.

#### 30.4 Choosing an Appropriate Vacuum State

In Section 28 we calculated variational vacuum wave functions for pure
SU( @xmath ) gauge theory for @xmath , 3, 4 and 5. Our motivation was to
use these wave functions as inputs to calculations of SU( @xmath )
massgaps. We obtained wave functions with a variational parameter that
was proportional to @xmath in the large @xmath limit and @xmath in the
small @xmath limit. However, this behaviour is incompatible with the
exact continuum vacuum wave function. For the one-plaquette trial state,
given by Eq. ( 110 ), to be compatible with the exact continuum vacuum
wave function in 2+1 dimensions, one must have @xmath in the large
@xmath limit Greensite ( 1987 ) . This result is independent of the
dimension of the gauge group in question. To understand this result we
must return to continuum non-Abelian gauge theory in 2+1 dimensions for
which Greensite Greensite ( 1979 ) argued that the infrared behaviour of
the vacuum can be described by the wavefunction,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (228)
  -- -------- -- -------

The simplest lattice analogue of Eq. ( 228 ) is the one-plaquette trial
state given by Eq. ( 110 ). Expanding the exponent of Eq. ( 110 ) about
@xmath using Eq. ( 42 ), we see that for the Eq. ( 110 ) to reduce to
Eq. ( 228 ) in the continuum limit and for @xmath to remain finite, the
variational parameter @xmath must be proportional to @xmath .

For the case of SU(2) in 2+1 dimensions, in the scaling region it has
been shown Greensite ( 1987 ) that for compatibility with the exact
SU(2) continuum vacuum wave function we must use the Greensite vacuum
wave function,

  -- -------- -------- -- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath         (229)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- -------

It is this vacuum wave function that was used by Arisue Arisue ( 1990 )
in the calculation that we generalise in this chapter. It would thus
seem that using a variational wave function is not appropriate in the
calculation of massgaps. However, this is not entirely the case as we
will now show.

Define the following quantities,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (230)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Here @xmath is an energy functional, @xmath a Hamiltonian, @xmath a
trial vacuum state, defined in Eq. ( 110 ), dependent on the coupling
only though the dependence of @xmath on @xmath . The @xmath are
determined variationally by minimising @xmath for each @xmath and the
function @xmath is chosen so that @xmath and @xmath are orthogonal.

Suppose that we calculate @xmath . We see from Eqs. ( 199 ) and ( 200 )
that this quantity depends on the coupling only through @xmath , @xmath
and a multiplicative factor of @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (231)
  -- -------- -- -------

Suppose that this calculation exhibits the appropriate scaling behavior
on some @xmath interval @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (232)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here @xmath is a constant. The variational parameters may be rescaled
with respect to @xmath and the same constant result is obtained but for
a different range of couplings @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (233)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here @xmath is the interval for which @xmath (i.e. @xmath is the image
of @xmath under @xmath ). If we choose @xmath such that @xmath gives the
correct scaling form (for example @xmath for SU(2) in 2+1 dimensions) we
then have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (234)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the exact ground state energy. This follows from the
fact that @xmath has the correct scaling form and so in the continuum
limit we have @xmath . Here @xmath is a small correction term that would
become smaller if we improved our trial vacuum by adding more
complicated Wilson loops in the exponent.

Since @xmath is constructed orthogonal to the ground state we have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (235)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the exact energy of the first excited state, and so

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (236)
  -- -------- -- -------

We cannot therefore say that we have an upper bound on the massgap, only
an approximation.

This argument demonstrates that if one obtains scaling with a given
@xmath in the vacuum wave function, the same result will be obtained
using a different function, @xmath , although in a different region of
coupling, provided that there exists a function @xmath such that @xmath
. For this reason we expect that the calculation of massgaps using the
variational trial state will agree with a calculation using the
Greensite vacuum wave function.

The argument above also demonstrates that the precise form of @xmath is
unimportant in the calculation of massgaps in this context. A numerical
demonstration of this for the case of 2+1 dimensional SU(3) gauge theory
is shown in Fig. 13 . We see that each glueball mass calculation
approaches the same constant scaling value (labelled by “Continuum
limit”) but at different values of @xmath . As it turns out, to
calculate variational wave functions for large dimension gauge groups is
cumbersome. Numerical precision becomes a factor in the minimisation of
the energy density. This problem is magnified in the calculation of
tadpole improved results. We thus abandon the use of variational wave
functions in the calculation of massgaps beyond SU(5). Instead we make
use of the one-plaquette wave function of Eq. ( 110 ) and define a
simple dependence @xmath , which most often will be @xmath .
Calculations for @xmath are presented in Chapter \thechapter .

### 31 SU(2), SU(3), SU(4) and SU(5) Massgap Results

In this section we present glueball mass results for SU( @xmath ) pure
gauge theory in 2+1 dimensions with @xmath , 3, 4 and 5. For each SU(3)
calculation we keep 80 terms in the @xmath -sum of Eq. ( 137 ) giving
convergence up to @xmath . For @xmath the truncation @xmath is used. The
generation of @xmath and @xmath and implementation of the minimisation
process is accomplished with a Mathematica code.

For the case of 2+1 dimensions we expect @xmath to become constant in
the scaling region. The convergence of the massgaps with @xmath is
illustrated in Fig. 14 . We notice that for @xmath only small
improvements to the scaling behaviour are gained by extending the
calculation beyond order 8 on the range of couplings shown. This
suggests that a more complicated basis (including, for example,
nonrectangular loops) is required to simulate SU( @xmath ) excited
states with @xmath than for the case of SU(2).

In Fig. 15 results for the lowest lying glueball mass, calculated with
Kogut-Susskind, improved and tadpole Hamiltonians, are shown. We see
that @xmath is approximated well by a constant, in very large scaling
regions, for the lowest lying eigenstates for all @xmath considered. The
scaling behavior becomes significantly worse for the antisymmetric
sector which is shown in Fig. 16 and for higher energy eigenvalues. This
is because the simplistic form of our excited state wave function is not
sufficient to reproduce the plaquette correlations required to simulate
these higher order states. One would expect the simulation of higher
order eigenstates to improve by including more complicated loops in our
expansion basis or by using a more complicated ground state. The
continuum limit excited states results for SU( @xmath ) are given in
Tables 1 — 7 .

For the unimproved SU(2) case, the masses of the lowest two eigenstates
agree closely with the calculations of Arisue Arisue ( 1990 )
(respectively @xmath and @xmath in units of @xmath , which is related to
@xmath by Eq. ( 36 )) in which the Greensite vacuum wave function of
Eq. ( 229 ) was used. This serves as a check on our counting in
calculating the possible overlaps of excited states. Our calculation is
in disagreement with that of Arisue at the third eigenstate, for which
Arisue calculates a mass @xmath . Our fourth eigenstate is close in mass
to Arisue’s third and our third eigenstate does not appear in his
results. The reasons for this are not clear.

The lowest mass unimproved SU(2) results (in units of @xmath ) lies
between the previous Lagrangian Monte Carlo calculation of Teper, @xmath
Teper ( 1999 ) , and the Hamiltonian strong coupling expansion result,
@xmath Hamer et al. ( 1992 ) . It should be made clear that the strong
coupling expansion result quoted here assumes that asymptotic weak
coupling behaviour is already established in the range, @xmath . Data
obtained from an extrapolation of the strong coupling expansion are fit
by a straight line in that region to give the quoted result. For
completeness, we must also mention that the coupled cluster estimates
agree on an increasing glueball mass up to @xmath but become variable
after that Llewellyn Smith and Watson ( 1993 ); Chen et al. ( 1994 ) .
Convergence with increasing order appears to be a serious problem in
such calculations.

The results for the SU(3) symmetric massgap (in units of @xmath ) are to
be compared to calculations by Luo and Chen @xmath Luo and Chen ( 1996 )
, Samuel @xmath Samuel ( 1997 ) and Teper @xmath Teper ( 1999 ) . Our
result of @xmath is considerably higher than all existing comparable
results. By including more complicated loops in the expansion basis one
would expect to reduce this estimate. This is emphasised by the fact
that when using only square basis states our result is considerably
higher. To explain the discrepancy between our results and others it is
important to note that since we use a basis of rectangles, we exclude
the contribution of many nonrectangular small area diagrams that are
included in the calculations of Teper and that of Luo and Chen. For this
reason it may be the case that what we have interpreted as the lowest
glueball mass in this chapter may, in fact, be a higher order excited
state. Teper has calculated the masses of the three lowest mass
glueballs for SU(3) in the @xmath sector Teper ( 1999 ) : @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath , with the respective results, in units of @xmath :
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath . It is interesting to note that our result
is closer to Teper’s first excited state. In the same study Teper also
calculated glueball masses in the @xmath sector for @xmath , 5 and 6.
The mass, in units of @xmath , of his @xmath state for SU(4) is @xmath
and @xmath for SU(5). We notice that as @xmath is increased the results
presented here move closer to the mass of Teper’s @xmath state, with the
improved results being closer than the unimproved. In fact for SU(5),
the results presented here, improved and unimproved, are consistent with
Teper’s @xmath mass. This forces us to question the interpretation of
the large @xmath plateaux in Fig. 15 as scaling regions for the lowest
mass glueballs. It is possible that the minima present in Fig. 15 in the
small @xmath region are possible scaling regions. It is possible that
our vacuum wave function and minimisation basis are insufficient to
extend this scaling region over a wide range of couplings and that as
our approximation breaks down we observe a level crossing effect. We
examine the possibility of the small @xmath minima being scaling regions
in Chapter \thechapter .

The antisymmetric results presented here can also be compared with those
of Teper Teper ( 1999 ) . While each of our results is considerably
higher than the masses of Teper’s @xmath and @xmath states, Teper’s
@xmath state is close in mass to the lowest mass state calculated here.
Teper obtains the following masses, in units of @xmath , for the @xmath
state: @xmath for SU(3), @xmath for SU(4) and @xmath for SU(5). It is
interesting to note that our corresponding lowest unimproved glueball
masses are consistent with these results. Our improved results show
better agreement with Teper’s @xmath state for SU(3) and SU(5) than the
corresponding unimproved results. The improved SU(4) results are also
consistent with Teper’s SU(4) @xmath mass although the agreement is
closer for the unimproved result.

When compared to equivalent unimproved calculations, the improved and
tadpole improved massgaps approach scaling faster as @xmath is
increased. This is evident in Figs. 14 and 15 and is expected since, for
an improved calculation one is closer to the continuum limit when
working at a given coupling. However, for most improved calculations the
scaling behaviour is marginally less precise than the equivalent
unimproved calculation. A possible reason for this is that the
one-plaquette trial state used here does not allow for direct
contributions from the improvement term in the kinetic Hamiltonian. For
this term to contribute directly one would need a trial state which
includes Wilson loops extending at least two links in at least one
direction.

The improved SU(2) massgap can be compared to the coupled cluster
calculation of Li et al Li et al. ( 2000 ) . Their result (in units of
@xmath ), @xmath , is again significantly lower than our result @xmath .
The difference is again attributable to the different choices of Wilson
loops used in the simulation of states. While our calculation makes use
of the simple one-plaquette ground state and a minimisation basis with
only rectangular loops, the coupled cluster calculation of Li et al uses
a more accurate ground state wave function consisting of an exponential
of a sum of extended loops which are not necessarily rectangular.
Without including additional small area Wilson loops we cannot be
confident that the lowest mass state accessible with our minimisation
basis is in fact the lowest mass state of the theory. Clearly there is
scope for more work here.

### 32 Conclusion

In this chapter we have extended the analytic techniques of 2+1
dimensional Hamiltonian LGT, traditionally used for SU(2), to general
SU( @xmath ). Impressive scaling is achieved over an extremely wide
range of couplings for the lowest energy eigenstates in the symmetric
and antisymmetric sectors. Our calculations use a one-plaquette trial
state and a basis of rectangular states over which excited state
energies are minimised. Such choices allow the use of analytic
techniques in SU( @xmath ) calculations.

The results of this chapter give estimates of the lowest unimproved,
improved and tadpole improved SU( @xmath ) glueball masses all of which
are above current estimates. We suspect that the reason for the
discrepancy is a lack of small area nonrectangular states in our
minimisation basis. A basis of rectangular states was used for
simplicity. The inclusion of nonrectangular states is straightforward
and only complicates the counting of overlaps between diagrams of a
particular type. When not including sufficient small area diagrams it is
possibly that the lowest mass states of the theory are not accessible
over a large range of couplings. A further improvement to our
calculation would involve the use of an improved trial vacuum state.
Such a state would possibly include several extended Wilson loops in its
exponent. Without the development of new techniques for performing the
required integrals the use of such a vacuum wave function would require
the use of Monte Carlo techniques for the calculation of expectation
values. In this scenario many advantages of the Hamiltonian approach
presented here would be lost.

In the next chapter we extend the calculations presented here to SU(25)
in an attempt to explore the mass spectrum in the large @xmath limit of
pure SU( @xmath ) gauge theory.

## Chapter \thechapter Large Physics

### 33 Introduction

In this chapter we study the glueball mass spectrum for large @xmath
pure gauge theory in 2+1 dimensions. Our primary motivation lies in
recent developments in string theory where a direct connection between
pure gauge theory in the large @xmath limit and certain string theories
has been conjectured. An independent test of this conjecture is provided
by large @xmath calculations of the glueball mass spectrum in LGT.
Impressive Monte Carlo calculations by Teper Teper ( 1999 ) and Lucini
and Teper Lucini and Teper ( 2002 , 2001 ) have progressed to the stage
where accurate values of glueball masses have been calculated up to
@xmath . This has allowed an extrapolation to the @xmath limit. With the
analytic techniques of the Hamiltonian approach it is possible to extend
these calculations to much larger @xmath , allowing a more reliable
@xmath extrapolation.

The outline of this chapter is as follows. We start in Section 34 with a
historical background, where the original motivations for large @xmath
physics are discussed and the recent developments in string theory
introduced. In Section 35 we consider the exploration of the large
@xmath limit directly by considering the @xmath limit of the expectation
values that appear in the variational calculation of massgaps. We then
move on to the extrapolation technique in Section 36 , where various
glueball masses are calculated at finite values of @xmath up to @xmath
in some cases. These results are then extrapolated to explore the large
@xmath limit of the 2+1 dimensional glueball spectrum. The @xmath limits
obtained here are compared to the results of the analogous Monte Carlo
studies in the Lagrangian approach.

### 34 Background

The nonperturbative region of QCD has been examined predominantly with
numerical techniques. While the numerical Monte Carlo simulations of
Lagrangian LGT have made significant progress, there have been few
developments in analytic techniques. One analytic technique which has
received considerable attention in recent years is the large @xmath
limit.

In 1974 ’t Hooft proposed a study of SU( @xmath ) gauge theories in the
large @xmath limit rather than the physically interesting @xmath case
’t Hooft ( 1974 ) . It was hoped that the SU( @xmath ) theory could be
solved analytically and would be, in some sense, close to SU(3). Indeed
it was shown that the large @xmath theory simplifies drastically
’t Hooft ( 1974 ) but still captures at least some of the complexity of
the SU(3) theory Witten ( 1979 ); Eguchi and Kawai ( 1982 ) . Motivated
by the fact that the QCD coupling constant, @xmath , is a poor expansion
parameter because its value depends on the energy scale of the process
under consideration, t’ Hooft considered an expansion in another
dimensionless parameter of SU( @xmath ) QCD, @xmath . Based on an
ingenious organisation of Feynman diagrams, ’t Hooft was able to show
that in the large @xmath limit, keeping the ’t Hooft coupling, @xmath ,
fixed, only planar diagrams remain. While the remaining planar theory
can be solved exactly in two dimensions, the three and four dimensional
theories have not yet been solved.

Recent developments in string theories have attempted to address this
problem. In 1997 Maldacena conjectured a correspondence, in the duality
sense, between superconformal field theories and string theory
propagating in a non-trivial geometry Maldacena ( 1998 ) . The idea
behind duality is that a single theory may have two (or more)
descriptions with the property that when one is strongly coupled the
other is weakly coupled. A technique for breaking the conformal
invariance and supersymmetry constraints of Maldacena’s original
proposal was later developed by Witten Witten ( 1998 ) . This led to the
hope that nonperturbative pure SU( @xmath ) gauge theories could be
described analytically in 3+1 dimensions by their string theory dual. To
develop this hope into a concrete solution would require perturbative
expansions within the dual string theory. Such developments would seem
to be some way off.

In order to test the viability of using string theories to probe
nonperturbative QCD independent tests are needed. The glueball mass
spectrum of QCD provides a perfect laboratory. Recent Monte Carlo
calculations have provided stable estimates of glueball masses up to
@xmath Teper ( 1999 ); Lucini and Teper ( 2001 ) in 2+1 dimensions and
up to @xmath Lucini and Teper ( 2001 ) in 3+1 dimensions. From these
estimates an @xmath limit can be extrapolated in each case. Convincing
evidence of @xmath finite @xmath corrections have been demonstrated in
2+1 dimensions, verifying a specific prediction of ’t Hooft’s @xmath
expansion in the quarkless case. From the string theory side, present
calculations require a strong coupling limit ( @xmath ) to be taken. In
this limit the string theory reduces to classical supergravity and the
calculation of glueball masses, @xmath , is straightforward. In this
limit the glueball is represented by a dilaton field whose mass can be
extracted by solving the dilaton wave equation Csaki et al. ( 1999a );
de Mello Koch et al. ( 1998 ); Zyskin ( 1998 ) . Despite the extreme
approximations required surprising quantitative agreement with the weak
coupling results from LGT were obtained. Later it was realised that, in
2+1 dimensions, lower mass states can be constructed from the graviton
field Brower et al. ( 2000a ) . With this approach the quantitative
agreement with LGT is lost but qualitative agreement in the form of the
prediction

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (237)
  -- -------- -- -------

still holds. The qualitative agreement between string theories and LGT
persists in 3+1 dimensions Brower et al. ( 2000b ) with

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (238)
  -- -------- -- -------

for both theories. It appears that the identification of glueball states
remains a problem. A serious difficulty is the removal of unwanted
states which have masses of the same magnitude as the glueballs. Recipes
for removing these unwanted states have been proposed Russo ( 1999 );
Csaki et al. ( 1999b ) but new parameters need to be introduced.

The exploration of large @xmath gauge theories outside of string theory
has not been restricted to traditional Monte Carlo methods. Recent
studies using the light-front Hamiltonian of transverse LGT have shown
agreement with the Monte Carlo calculations of Teper Dalley and van de
Sande ( 2001 ) . In this approach explicit calculations at @xmath are
possible without the need for extrapolation. Continuum calculations,
without the use of string theory, have also commenced. An impressive
series of papers Karabali and Nair ( 1996 ); Karabali et al. ( 1998a , b
) has led to specific predictions for the string tension for all @xmath
in 2+1 dimensions Karabali et al. ( 1998b ) . These predictions lie
within @xmath of lattice calculations up to @xmath beyond which LGT
results are not available. A recent review is available in Ref. Nair (
2002 ) .

### 35 Direct Calculation of Asymptotics

In this section we consider the direct calculation of the asymptotics of
the generating functions defined in Chapter \thechapter . In this way it
is hoped that analytic forms for the asymptotics of the matrix elements
on which the glueball masses depend will be obtained. We start with the
generating function of Eq. ( 156 ).

To calculate the asymptotic form of Eq. ( 156 ) in the large @xmath
limit we make use of a differential equation technique and some
elementary linear algebra Krattenhaler ( 1999 ) . Consider an @xmath
matrix, @xmath , depending on parameters @xmath and @xmath , for which
we wish to calculate the determinant. Provided an @xmath matrix @xmath
exists such that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (239)
  -- -------- -- -------

the determinant of @xmath satisfies the simple first order differential
equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (240)
  -- -------- -- -------

The problem of finding the determinant reduces to one of finding a
suitable @xmath and solving the first order differential equation in
Eq. ( 240 ).

Consider the @xmath matrix @xmath whose @xmath -th entry is defined as
follows

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (241)
  -- -------- -- -------

Making use of Mathematica we calculate a suitable @xmath such that
@xmath satisfies Eq. ( 239 ) for various @xmath and @xmath . In this way
a general form for @xmath may be guessed. Once a form is guessed the
proof that it satisfies Eq. ( 239 ) for all @xmath and @xmath is simply
a matter of substitution. Calculations for @xmath and @xmath suggest a
general form for @xmath which has a trace given by,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (242)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

with the higher order terms vanishing in the @xmath limit. To find an
asymptotic form for @xmath we must however do better than this and find
the asymptotic form for the matrix @xmath , not simply its trace. At
this stage we have not found such an asymptotic form. Without such a
result we can only conjecture an asymptotic form for @xmath . However
all is not lost. The success or failure of any asymptotic form that we
conjecture can be determined numerically.

Substituting Eq. ( 242 ) in Eq. ( 240 ) and solving the resulting
differential equation leads to the asymptotic form,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (243)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here @xmath does not depend on @xmath . We determine @xmath by noticing
that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (244)
  -- -------- -- -------

Again we use Mathematica and calculate @xmath for various @xmath and
@xmath . Some numerical experimentation leads to the conjecture that, in
the large @xmath limit,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (245)
  -- -------- -- -------

We denote the fractional error of this expansion by @xmath . To verify
this result numerically we plot @xmath for various @xmath and @xmath as
a function of @xmath . The typical examples of @xmath and @xmath with
@xmath are shown in Fig. 17 . Fast convergence over a large range of
@xmath ans @xmath is increased is clear. Similar results are obtained
for other values of @xmath . In each case it is clear that convergence
hastens for @xmath .

Making use of Eqs. ( 156 ) and ( 245 ) we obtain the large @xmath
asymptotics of the SU( @xmath ) generating function,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (246)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

We now move on to the second generating function of Chapter \thechapter
, that of Eq. ( 175 ). For this case we define

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (247)
  -- -------- -- -------

For the purpose of calculating the matrix element @xmath in the large
@xmath limit, we are interested in the large @xmath asymptotic form of

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (248)
  -- -------- -- -------

Again we perform numerical experiments using Mathematica and conjecture
that there exists a @xmath such that

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (249)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

with

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (250)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

We then have,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (251)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Here we have recognised that @xmath and used Eq. ( 245 ). Making use of
Eq. ( 176 ) we can sum Eq. ( 251 ) over @xmath to obtain the asymptotic
form of the following SU( @xmath ) integral,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (252)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Compiling the above results we expect the following simple asymptotic
forms for the matrix elements on which the glueball masses depend:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (253)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

These limits are verified numerically in direct calculations of the
matrix elements as @xmath is increased but only for small @xmath . For
finite @xmath , glueball mass scaling occurs at large @xmath , outside
the range of @xmath for which the asymptotic forms listed in Eq. ( 253 )
hold. The problem can be explained as follows. In the above we have
taken the naive @xmath limit. The limit in which we are interested is
the one in which @xmath with @xmath held constant. In practice @xmath is
given a dependence on @xmath and hence the requirement that @xmath
remain fixed forces a functional dependence of @xmath on @xmath . For
instance if we have @xmath then @xmath in the large @xmath limit if
@xmath is held constant. The large @xmath limit of the matrix elements
therefore cannot be analysed until the functional dependence of @xmath
on @xmath is fixed. It would therefore seem that an accurate description
of the expectation values arising the glueball mass calculation in the
large @xmath limit, requires many more terms than calculated here.

### 36 Extrapolation

#### 36.1 Introduction

It this section we calculate 2+1 dimensional SU( @xmath ) massgaps for
various @xmath with the method of Section 30 , with the intention of
exploring the large @xmath limit of the results obtained. With this
method we can extend the calculation of the lowest energy massgaps to
SU(25) on a desktop computer. This should be compared to current results
in the Lagrangian approach which are limited, at present, to SU(6). With
large values of @xmath available a more reliable extrapolation to the
@xmath limit is possible.

For the minimisation process, we use the same basis of rectangular
states as in Section 30 . With this basis the states @xmath and @xmath ,
with @xmath or 2, are accessible. The @xmath states require the use of a
minimisation basis that contains no square states so that the excited
states are invariant under rotations by @xmath but not @xmath . The
dependence of the massgaps on the coupling does not change significantly
as @xmath is increased. We do however observe the appearance of what
could possibly be additional low @xmath scaling regions as @xmath is
increased.

#### 36.2 Convergence with

In Section 28.3 the dependence of the variational parameter on the
truncation of the @xmath -sum in Eq. ( 156 ) was considered. The
calculation of the variational parameter depends only on the plaquette
expectation value. The dependence of the massgaps on the truncation
should also be explored as their calculation incorporates on additional
matrix elements. We find that fast convergence is achieved as @xmath is
increased for the @xmath massgaps. A typical example is shown in Fig.
18(a) , where the massgaps are almost indistinguishable up to @xmath on
the scale of the plot. For @xmath the convergence is not as fast. A
typical example is shown in Fig. 18(b) . We find that in order to obtain
convergence of the antisymmetric massgaps up to @xmath for SU(25) we
need a truncation of @xmath .

#### 36.3 The Small Minima

The massgaps for @xmath , in units of @xmath do not differ significantly
as functions of @xmath . The lowest lying @xmath glueball masses have
the characteristic form shown in Fig. 18(a) for each @xmath . We observe
a minimum at small @xmath and a scaling plateau at large @xmath .

In this section we examine the minima occurring in the lowest @xmath and
@xmath glueball masses and consider the possibility that they may
correspond to a scaling region. It appears that for SU(3) this region
has been interpreted as a scaling region by some authors Fang et al. (
2002 ); Chen et al. ( 1995 ); Leonard ( 2001 ) . From the scaling
arguments of Section 30.4 , by changing the functional dependence of the
parameter appearing in the vacuum state the scaling region can be
modified. In this way it is possible to choose the variational
parameter’s dependence on @xmath such that the region in which the
massgap takes its minimum is stretched over a large @xmath interval. In
the same way, the scaling plateau occurring for large @xmath may be
compressed. With this in mind, it is unclear which scaling region we
should take to be the correct one. For this reason we analyse both
potential scaling regions. We start, in this section, with the small
@xmath minima and consider the large @xmath plateaux in the next
section.

Fig. 19 shows the lowest lying SU( @xmath ) @xmath glueball masses in
2+1 dimensions in units of @xmath as functions of @xmath for various
@xmath . It is apparent that the minima depend only weakly on @xmath .
We see that the minima appear to approach a finite limit from below as
@xmath . On the scale of Fig. 19 the minima corresponding to @xmath and
@xmath are barely distinguishable.

Let us denote the minima in Fig. 19 by @xmath and consider them as a
functions of @xmath . Fitting @xmath to the model

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (254)
  -- -------- -- -------

for @xmath gives best fit parameters

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (255)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

We fit on the data @xmath to minimise pollution from next to leading
order corrections. If we assert that the power of the leading order
correction for finite @xmath must be an integer power of @xmath , then
from Eq. ( 255 ) that order must be 2 in agreement with the predictions
of large @xmath QCD. Fitting to a model with @xmath corrections for
@xmath gives

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (256)
  -- -------- -- -------

We can go further and attempt to find the next to leading order
corrections by fitting to the model

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (257)
  -- -------- -- -------

The best fit parameters when fit on the whole data set are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (258)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (259)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (260)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (261)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

which is in disagreement with integer power next to leading order
corrections. A good fit however is achieved to the model with @xmath
next to leading order corrections:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (262)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

The precise locations of the minima, @xmath , are plotted as a function
of @xmath in Fig. 21 along with the fitted models of Eqs. ( 256 ) and (
262 ).

From Eq. ( 256 ), our best fit result for the @xmath limit of @xmath is
@xmath . The error here is purely statistical. We should, as always,
expect a significant systematic error attributable to our choice of
ground state and minimisation basis. This result may be compared to the
Monte Carlo calculation of Lucini and Teper who obtain the @xmath limit
of the lowest @xmath glueball mass as @xmath Lucini and Teper ( 2002 ) .
This is comparable to the result presented here. The result of Lucini
and Teper is based on a linear extrapolation to the @xmath limit of
@xmath data. Their result differs significantly from the one presented
here at the leading order finite @xmath corrections. The correction term
obtained by Lucini and Teper, @xmath , has the same sign but is
significantly smaller than the one presented here. When our data is fit
on the range @xmath (we don’t obtain a small @xmath minimum for SU(2))
our slope is halved but is still significantly larger than that of
Lucini and Teper. It should be pointed out that Lucini and Teper’s
calculation was performed in the Lagrangian approach in which the
coupling is the so called Euclidean coupling @xmath . The Euclidean
coupling and the Hamiltonian coupling, @xmath , are equal up to order
@xmath corrections. The precise relation between the couplings is only
known for small @xmath Hamer ( 1996 ) , a case which does not apply for
the small @xmath minima. It appears that our simple calculation induces
a level crossing whereby the lowest mass glueball state switches to a
higher mass state beyond the small @xmath minimum. Although we do not
have an explanation for this, presumably, by including additional states
in the minimisation basis or implementing a more complicated vacuum
state, the level crossing would no longer appear and the small @xmath
minima would extend into large @xmath scaling regions. This should be
checked in further studies. A glueball mass extracted from a large
@xmath scaling region can be confidently compared to a corresponding
Lagrangian calculation, for in that region of couplings the ratio of
@xmath to @xmath is unity.

We obtain small @xmath minima for the @xmath massgaps but only for
@xmath . Plots of these massgaps with @xmath are shown in Fig. 20 . The
behaviour is significantly different to that observed for the symmetric
massgap. By @xmath the minima do not appear close to convergence. Indeed
if convergence is occurring at all, it is significantly slower than was
observed for the @xmath state. To explore this further, in Fig. 22 we
plot the minima of Fig. 20 , which we again denote by @xmath , as a
function of @xmath . We observe linear behaviour in the large @xmath
limit. Fitting the @xmath data to the model

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (263)
  -- -------- -- -------

gives best fit parameters

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (264)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

which is consistent with @xmath . Fitting the @xmath data to a model
with leading order finite @xmath corrections starting at @xmath gives

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (265)
  -- -------- -- -------

As was done for the symmetric case we can attempt to go further and find
the form of the next to leading order finite @xmath corrections. Fitting
the @xmath data to the model

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (266)
  -- -------- -- -------

gives best fit parameters

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (267)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (268)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (269)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (270)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

indicating vanishingly small next to leading order corrections for
@xmath . The models @xmath and @xmath are plotted against the @xmath
data in Fig. 22 .

The small @xmath minima appear to converge to a non-zero @xmath limit.
The convergence is significantly slower than for the small @xmath minima
in the symmetric case. It is also clear that the leading order finite
@xmath corrections are not the expected @xmath but rather @xmath . The
@xmath limit of @xmath is approximately half the corresponding @xmath
result. Such a state does not appear in the calculation of Teper.

It is possible that the small @xmath minima are spurious. Dimensional
analysis gives the expected scaling form but does not allow us to decide
which scaling region is preferable, or if one is a lattice artifact.
However, based on lattice calculations to date, we expect the @xmath
glueball to be lighter than the @xmath in the continuum limit. Spurious
scaling regions have been observed in other lattice calculations
Wichmann ( 2001 ) . It is clear that additional analysis is needed here.
Again, an important step will be to include additional nonrectangular
states in the minimisation basis.

#### 36.4 The Large Plateaux

Having considered the small @xmath minima as possible scaling regions we
now move on to the large @xmath plateaux. This scaling region appears
for all @xmath and for all states considered and so its interpretation
as a genuine scaling region is less dubious. Furthermore, the glueball
mass results extracted from these scaling regions may be confidently
compared to the corresponding Lagrangian calculations since the ratio of
the Hamiltonian to Euclidean coupling is unity up to small @xmath
corrections.

We start with the @xmath state for which the best scaling behaviour is
obtained. We calculate the five lowest lying massgaps corresponding to
the five lowest glueball masses accessible with our choice of ground
state and minimisation basis. We consider values of @xmath in the range
@xmath . For each @xmath considered we find a large @xmath scaling
plateau for each of the five lowest mass states. The lowest lying
massgap is shown in Fig. 23 for a range of @xmath . We observe that in
units of @xmath the massgaps do not depend strongly on @xmath and that
in the scaling region they appear to approach a finite limit. Similar
observations can be made for the four higher mass states obtained,
although the scaling behaviour is less precise. We show the second
lowest glueball mass in Fig. 24 as an example. A continuum limit for
each massgap is obtained in the scaling region by fitting to a constant.
For each fit we use a region of at least 10 data points which minimises
the standard error. The continuum limit results for the five lowest
lying massgaps, denoted by @xmath , are shown as functions of @xmath in
Figs. 23 and 26 . Also shown in the plots are fits to models with
leading order large @xmath corrections starting @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (271)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here the subscript @xmath labels the @xmath -th lowest glueball mass.
The values of the best fit parameters are given in Table 8 .

These results should be compared with those of Lucini and Teper who
obtain large @xmath glueball masses in units of @xmath in the @xmath
sector with linear fits given by

  -- -------- -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      (272)
  -- -------- -- -------- -- -------

The fit for the @xmath state is obtained using @xmath data. The
remaining fits are obtained using @xmath data. We find that the lowest
glueball mass extracted from our large @xmath plateaux is consistent, in
the @xmath limit, with the state which Lucini and Teper label @xmath .
The slopes of the fits are of the same sign but differ significantly in
magnitude. The @xmath state of Lucini and Teper does not appear in our
data in the form of a large @xmath scaling plateau. There is however a
hint of an approach to scaling in the vicinity of their result in our
second lowest massgap data. This effect is only visible in our data for
@xmath and occurs for small @xmath as shown in Fig. 27 . The values of
@xmath for which this effect appears are quite close to those for which
the small beta minima are observed in the lowest mass eigenstate.
Similar effects are observed in the @xmath data but the effect is much
less convincing with the data currently available.

Let us consider this small @xmath region as a possible scaling region.
We fit a constant to the available @xmath data on a range of at least 4
data points chosen so that the standard error is minimised. These
scaling values are plotted as a function of @xmath in Fig. 28 . Also
shown is the best fit linear model

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (273)
  -- -------- -- -------

This produces an @xmath limit which is close to, but inconsistent with,
the result obtained by Lucini and Teper for their @xmath state.

We now move on to the @xmath states. For these states the scaling
behaviour is not as precise as that obtained for the @xmath states.
Again we calculate the five lowest lying massgaps corresponding to the
five lowest mass glueballs accessible with our choice of minimisation
basis and ground state. For each @xmath considered up to 25 we find a
large @xmath scaling plateau for each of the five states. The lowest
lying massgap is shown in Fig. 29 for a range of @xmath . The second
lowest energy massgap is shown in Fig. 30 . Considerably less data has
been obtained for the @xmath states due to the large @xmath required for
convergence as discussed in Section 36.2 . Despite this, the results
qualitatively replicate those of the @xmath states. We observe that in
units of @xmath the massgaps do not depend strongly on @xmath and that
in the scaling region they appear to approach a finite limit. Similar
observations can be made for the four higher mass states, although the
scaling behaviour is less precise. The continuum limit values extracted
are plotted as functions of @xmath in Figs. 31 and 32 . The dashed lines
show fits of the continuum limit values to the model

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (274)
  -- -------- -- -------

with the parameters for each excited state given in Table 9 .

These results should be compared again with those of Lucini and Teper
who obtain large @xmath glueball masses in units of @xmath in the @xmath
sector with linear fits given by

  -- -------- -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      (275)
  -- -------- -- -------- -- -------

The result for @xmath is from Ref. Teper ( 1999 ) . All fits were
obtained using @xmath data. The @xmath limit of our lowest lying massgap
extracted from the large @xmath plateaux is consistent with Teper’s
@xmath result.

Having considered spin 0 states we now move on to spin 2, the only other
spin accessible when using a basis of rectangular states. For the case
of spin 2 the scaling behaviour of the massgaps is significantly worse
than for spin 0. More troublesome is the fact that the convergence of
the @xmath massgaps with increasing @xmath is slower than the case of
@xmath . The situation for the @xmath state is markedly better with the
convergence of massgaps with increasing @xmath being no different to
that of @xmath . For this reason we concentrate on the @xmath sector
here.

The @xmath states produce less precise scaling behaviour than the spin 0
states. However large @xmath plateaux appear for each of the five lowest
lying massgaps. We use these regions to estimate their respective
continuum limits. For these states small @xmath minima do not appear.
The lowest lying @xmath massgap is shown in Fig. 33 for a range of
@xmath . Once again we observe that in units of @xmath the massgaps do
not depend strongly on @xmath and that in the scaling region they appear
to approach a finite limit. Similar observations can be made for the
four higher energy states obtained, although the scaling behaviour
worsens as the mass of the state increases. The extracted continuum
limit values are plotted as functions of @xmath in Figs. 34 and 35 . The
dashed lines show fits to the model

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (276)
  -- -------- -- -------

The best fit parameters for each excited state are given in Table 10 .

Once again these results should be compared with those of Lucini and
Teper who obtain large @xmath glueball masses in units of @xmath in the
@xmath sector with linear fits derived from @xmath data given by

  -- -------- -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      (277)
  -- -------- -- -------- -- -------

The @xmath result is from Ref. Teper ( 1999 ) . The @xmath results
presented here are significantly higher. This time no correspondence
between our results and those of Lucini and Teper can be obtained.

We finish this section by presenting the mass spectra obtained for the
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath sectors. The results are summarised by the
plots in Figs. 36 , 37 and 38 .

#### 36.5 An Empirical Observation

In this subsection we present an empirical observation that could
possibly be useful in the construction of simple glueball models. Since
Lucini and Teper include many small area Wilson loops in their
construction of excited states, we assume that they calculate the lowest
few glueball states without omission. We assume the calculations
presented here give higher mass glueball states. Presumably, the correct
enumeration of these states is not possible without the inclusion of
nonrectangular states in the minimisation basis. For example, the third
lowest mass state in a given sector calculated here could be the true
seventh lowest mass state. However, when our results are combined with
those of Lucini and Teper an interesting empirical observation can be
made. We can choose a labelling of the @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
excited states such that the large @xmath limit of their masses lie on a
straight line as shown in Fig. 39 . We have included the results of
Lucini and Teper for @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath which do not
correspond to any of the states calculated here. The straight lines are
fits to the model,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (278)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath are parameters and @xmath is restricted to
integer values. For the @xmath states considered we obtain the following
best fit models

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (279)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Here @xmath labels the @xmath -th lowest mass state. We note that the
fit improves in accuracy as @xmath is increased. It is interesting to
note that the slopes of the @xmath and @xmath models are consistent
suggesting that the constant of proportionality does not depend on
@xmath . Another interesting observation can be made by recasting the
models in the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (280)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

We notice a similarity with the two dimensional harmonic oscillator
spectrum,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (281)
  -- -------- -- -------

when we take into consideration the ambiguity modulo 4 of spin
identification on the lattice. With this in mind we propose a simple
model for the @xmath spectrum

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (282)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a spin independent parameter and @xmath is an integer
for which @xmath . From Eq. ( 279 ) we have @xmath and @xmath . To check
this simple model we can attempt to predict the lowest lying states
obtained by Lucini and Teper in the sectors that have not been
considered in this chapter. We start with the @xmath sector in which
Teper and Lucini obtain @xmath and @xmath for the @xmath limit of the
@xmath and @xmath glueball masses in units of @xmath . The predictions
of Eq. ( 282 ), with @xmath and @xmath , are 1.28 and 1.79 for the 1st
and 2nd lowest glueball masses in units of @xmath . As we would expect
the prediction is better for the higher mass state. We can also consider
the @xmath sector which has an equivalent spectrum to @xmath due to the
phenomenon of parity doubling Teper ( 1999 ) . Lucini and Teper obtain
@xmath for the mass of the @xmath glueball in units of @xmath . The
model of Eq. ( 282 ), with @xmath and @xmath , gives 2.048. In the
@xmath sector the agreement is not as good, with Lucini and Teper
obtaining @xmath for the mass of the @xmath glueball and the model of
Eq. ( 282 ), with @xmath and @xmath , giving 1.812.

It will be interesting to see if the model suggested here stands up to
further calculations with an extended minimisation basis and in other
@xmath sectors. The analytic techniques presented here are at a great
advantage to the standard Monte Carlo techniques of Lagrangian LGT for
the purpose of testing glueball models. High order excited states are
readily accessible; in a variational calculation with @xmath states in
the minimisation basis, @xmath glueball states are accessible. This is
in contrast to competing Lagrangian calculations in which only @xmath
states are currently accessible in some @xmath sectors.

#### 36.6 Discussion

In this section we have calculated variational mass spectra for pure SU(
@xmath ) gauge theory with a simple basis of rectangular states in 2+1
dimensions. Such a basis is easy to work with computationally and is
therefore a good starting point. However to accurately explore the pure
gauge mass spectra additional states need to be included. Perhaps a more
suitable basis would be the set of all states with an area less than
some maximum value which would define the order of the calculation. The
next stage beyond this would be to include higher representation states
in the form of Wilson loops in which some links are covered more than
once. In this way multiple glueball states could presumably be explored.
The inclusion of additional small area states in the basis, in
particular states which are not symmetric about reflections in
coordinate axes, would also allow the calculation of spin @xmath
glueball masses and also massgaps in the @xmath sector.

It is important to point out that the inclusion of additional states in
our minimisation basis does not present a significant challenge. The
only complication would be in counting the possible overlaps of
particular states. While more difficult than the counting required here,
the process could presumably be automated using symbolic programming and
techniques from graph theory. The analytic techniques used here would
still be applicable until higher representation states were included in
the minimisation basis. At that stage further character integrals would
be required to handle the additional integrals arising in the
calculation.

A final extension of the method presented here would be to make use of
an improved ground state; a ground state which includes additional
Wilson loops in the exponent. However, the advantage of using analytic
techniques would then be lost, unless new technology was developed for
tackling the resulting integrals. One would need to calculate the
required matrix elements via Monte Carlo simulation on small lattices,
losing the advantage of working on an infinite lattice with analytic
expressions that we have here.

### 37 Conclusion

In this chapter we have applied the analytic techniques developed in
Chapter \thechapter , in a study of the large @xmath glueball mass
spectrum in 2+1 dimensions.

A direct attempt at calculating asymptotic expansions of the generating
functions was carried out in Section 35 . While some low order large
@xmath expansions were obtained, many terms appear to be needed for a
direct @xmath calculation of the matrix elements appearing in glueball
mass calculations at small couplings.

Having tried a direct approach to calculating matrix elements in the
@xmath limit without success, an extrapolation technique was used. In
Section 36 we calculated glueball masses at finite @xmath , with @xmath
as large as 25 in some cases. This allowed accurate @xmath
extrapolations to be made. Evidence of leading order @xmath finite
@xmath corrections to the glueball masses was obtained, confirming a
specific prediction of large @xmath gauge theory. The interpretation of
the possible scaling regions was discussed and agreement with the
Lagrangian study of Lucini and Teper Lucini and Teper ( 2002 ) was
obtained in some cases in the @xmath limit. The discrepancies are
attributable to our use of only rectangular states in the minimisation
basis. Without the inclusion of small area, nonrectangular states, it is
likely that some low energy states are inaccessible. Further work will
fill in the incomplete spectra presented here. Interesting empirical
observations were made when the results presented here were combined
with those of Lucini and Teper; the enumeration of excited states can be
chosen so that the glueball mass spectrum has the structure of a two
dimensional harmonic oscillator. To develop this observation into a
model would require a more complete calculation of the mass spectrum
with nonrectangular states in the minimisation basis and possibly a more
complicated vacuum trial state.

Clearly much work remains to be done before an accurate picture of the
2+1 dimensional pure SU( @xmath ) gauge theory spectrum is achieved
within a Hamiltonian variational approach. We have demonstrated however
that the analytic techniques of Hamiltonian LGT can be used for massgap
calculations with @xmath as large as 25 on a desktop computer. This is
significantly closer to the @xmath limit than is currently possible with
the Lagrangian approach using supercomputers. The inclusion of
additional states in the minimisation basis, while not presenting a
major challenge, will allow a thorough study of the 2+1 dimensional pure
SU( @xmath ) mass spectrum at least up to @xmath .

In the next chapter we consider the extension of the analytic techniques
used with success in 2+1 dimensions here, to the physically interesting
case of 3+1 dimensions.

## Chapter \thechapter 3+1 Dimensions

### 38 Outline

In this chapter we explore the viability of extending the analytic
techniques used with success in Chapters \thechapter and \thechapter to
the calculation of glueball masses in the pure gauge sector in 3+1
dimensions. The primary difficulty lies in the calculation of
expectation values in 3+1 dimensions. In Section 39 we briefly review
what has been achieved in Hamiltonian LGT in 3+1 dimensions. We discuss
the difficulties faced in 3+1 dimensions and possible solutions in
Section 40 . In Section 41 we consider the problem of Gauss’ law
constraints. This is a topic that has been discussed in the context of
Hamiltonian LGT most recently by Ligterink, Walet and Bishop Ligterink
et al. ( 2000 ) and concerns the constraint equations that appear when
non-abelian gauge theories are canonically quantised. In Section 42 we
move on to the calculation of variational glueball masses on a single
cube using the analytic variational technique discussed in Chapters
\thechapter and \thechapter . We finish in Section 43 with a discussion
of the viability of pursuing analytic techniques for pure SU( @xmath )
LGT in 3+1 dimensions based on the results of Section 42 .

### 39 Introduction

From a renormalisation point of view the key difference between 2+1 and
3+1 dimensional gauge theory lies in the units of the coupling constant.
As was seen in Chapter \thechapter , 2+1 dimensional gauge theory has a
coupling constant, @xmath , with the dimensions of mass and so the
coupling constant explicitly sets a mass scale for calculations on the
lattice. In contrast the 3+1 dimensional coupling constant is
dimensionless. This makes the extraction of continuum physics from
lattice calculations more subtle in 3+1 dimensions than in 2+1, as
discussed in Section 8 .

On a practical level, in Hamiltonian calculations there is a more
serious problem faced in moving from 2+1 to 3+1 dimensions. The analytic
techniques that we have used with success in Chapters \thechapter and
\thechapter are no longer applicable. These techniques rely heavily upon
the fact that in 2+1 dimensions a change of variables from links to
plaquettes has unit Jacobian. The form for the equivalent Jacobian in
3+1 dimensions is considerably more complicated. The most comprehensive
study of the change of variables from links to plaquettes is due to
Batrouni Batrouni ( 1982a , 1983 ) . We discuss this change of variables
in more detail in Section 40 .

The extension of the techniques used in Chapters \thechapter and
\thechapter to 3+1 dimensions is not straightforward. There are a number
of immediate problems. Firstly, since plaquettes are not independent
variables in 3+1 dimensions one can not automatically work in the
infinite volume limit. In a precise study one would need to calculate
identical quantities on different sized lattices and extrapolate to the
infinite volume limit. Secondly, in the context of analytic
calculations, even on small lattices the integrals involved in the
calculation of basic matrix elements are considerably more complicated
than those encountered in 2+1 dimensions. Such matrix elements could in
principle be carried out analytically on small lattices but since the
number of integration variables increases quickly with the volume of the
lattice a calculation on even a @xmath lattice would seem exceedingly
difficult. How quickly the infinite volume limit is reached will
therefore determine the worth of pursuing analytic Hamiltonian methods
in 3+1 dimensions. Finally, there is the complication of Gauss’ law
which we discuss in Section 41 .

The only Hamiltonian techniques to have been applied with any success to
the case of SU(3) gauge theory in 3+1 dimensions have been strong
coupling expansions, the @xmath -expansion and exponential wave function
methods. Each of which we now summarise.

Strong coupling perturbative techniques were used in the early days of
LGT in an attempt to bridge the gap between the strong and weak coupling
limits. Strong coupling expansions of the Callan-Symanzik @xmath
function were calculated to @xmath Kogut et al. ( 1979 ); Kogut ( 1980 )
and showed signs of interpolating smoothly between the strong and weak
coupling limits. This suggested that the @xmath function was a smooth
function of the coupling with its only zero at @xmath , providing a
strong argument at the time for the continuum limit of LGT confining
quarks. Corresponding strong coupling expressions for glueball masses
did not share the same success. Despite strong coupling calculations to
@xmath Hamer ( 1989 ) scaling was not observed in @xmath , @xmath or
@xmath glueball masses.

The @xmath -expansion was introduced by Horn and Weinstein Horn and
Weinstein ( 1984 ) as an analytic method suitable for the study of LGT
in the Hamiltonian formulation. It has been applied in the calculation
of glueball masses in 3+1 dimensions for SU(2) Horn et al. ( 1985 ) and
SU(3) van den Doel and Horn ( 1986 , 1987 ); Horn and Lana ( 1991 ) LGT
in the pure gauge sector. More recently it has been used in an attempt
to calculate the lowest hadron masses Horn and Schreiber ( 1993 ) . For
each case, however, asymptotic scaling of masses was not directly
observed. Extrapolation techniques such as Padé approximants were
required to probe the weak coupling region. The extrapolated values mass
ratio results agreed with Monte Carlo estimates of the time.

The coupled cluster method and related exponential wave function
techniques have received by far the most attention in Hamiltonian LGT in
recent years. Essentially these techniques aim to solve the
Kogut-Susskind eigenvalue equation by making a suitable ansatz for the
wave function. The coupled cluster method was originally constructed
with applications in nuclear physics in mind Coester ( 1958 ); Coester
and Kümmel ( 1960 ) but has since found the majority of its applications
in molecular physics Bishop and Kümmel ( 1987 ) . Its application in the
context of Hamiltonian LGT is described in Refs. Schütte et al. ( 1997 )
and McKellar et al. ( 2000 ) . The truncated eigenvalue method,
developed by Guo, Chen and Li Guo et al. ( 1994 ) , is another
exponential wave function technique to have found application in
Hamiltonian LGT.

A number of groups have made considerable progress in the application of
exponential wave function techniques to Hamiltonian LGT in 3+1
dimensions. While most studies have explored gauge groups other than
SU(3) in less than three dimensions, studies of SU(3) glueballs in 3+1
dimensions have commenced. Results tangent to the expected scaling form,
indicating an approach to scaling, have been obtained for SU(3) pure
gauge theory in a coupled cluster calculation by Leonard Leonard ( 2001
) . However convergence with increasing orders appears to be slow.
Finite order truncation errors appear to be under more control in the
truncated eigenvalue method. The first calculations of 3+1 dimensional
SU(3) glueball masses with this method Hu et al. ( 1997 ) gave a @xmath
to @xmath mass ratio that was consistent with the Monte Carlo results of
the time. The agreement was not as good for the @xmath to @xmath mass
ratio. A convincing demonstration of asymptotic scaling has not yet been
produced in a calculation of glueball masses for SU(3) in 3+1
dimensions.

More promising 3+1 dimensional results have been obtained for higher
dimensional gauge groups. Ironically these results have been obtained
with much simpler methods than either of the exponential wave function
methods described above. Asymptotic scaling of the lowest @xmath
glueball mass has been demonstrated by Chin, Long and Robson in a
variational calculation on a small volume ( @xmath sites) lattice for
SU(5) and SU(6) Chin et al. ( 1986 ) . This calculation follows the
variational technique described in Chapter \thechapter but uses Monte
Carlo rather than analytic techniques to calculate the required
expectation values. It uses only plaquette states in the minimisation
basis rather than the large basis of rectangular states used in Chapters
\thechapter and \thechapter . Naively one would hope that the same
method could be explored on similar sized lattices for larger @xmath ,
with additional states in the minimisation basis, using the analytic
techniques of Chapters \thechapter and \thechapter . We take this as our
motivation for the studies presented in this chapter. It will become
clear however that attempting a similar calculation to Chin, Long and
Robson on a single cube using analytic techniques presents a significant
challenge.

### 40 The Move to 3+1 Dimensions

In LGT one usually works in 2+1 dimensions to test a technique with the
intention of later extending it to the physically relevant 3+1
dimensions. This may be justified in the Lagrangian approach where the
time coordinate is treated on the same footing as the spatial
coordinates and adding another dimension equates to nothing more than an
increased load on computer memory. However, in Hamiltonian LGT two
serious technical differences exists between 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions. The
first is Gauss’ law and the second is related to constructing a Jacobian
for transforming from link to plaquette variables.

To understand the first difference one needs to recall that Hamiltonian
LGT is formulated in the temporal gauge which sets @xmath . If one
starts with the Yang-Mills Lagrangian and performs the standard
equal-time quantisation, one runs into problems because the time
derivative of @xmath does not appear in the Lagrangian. The variational
principle gives equations of motion for the space-like components
resulting in the standard Yang-Mills Hamiltonian. For the time-like
component we obtain a set of algebraic constraint equations which are
the analogue of Gauss’ law. There is one constraint equation for each
colour component of @xmath , @xmath for SU( @xmath ), at each lattice
site. As has been pointed out in the context of Hamiltonian LGT by
Ligterink, Walet and Bishop Ligterink et al. ( 2000 ) , it is only when
one works with a set of variables whose number of degrees of freedom
matches the number of unconstrained degrees of freedom in the theory,
that one can avoid the technicalities of constraint equations. For this
reason, in 2+1 dimensions we really are quite lucky. The number of
plaquette variables on a square two dimensional lattice is precisely
equal to the number of unconstrained variables Ligterink et al. ( 2000 )
. For a three dimensional cubic lattice this is not the case. One could
envisage constructing a polyhedral lattice in @xmath dimensions such
that the number of faces (plaquettes) would equal the number of
unconstrained variables. However such lattices appear to be prohibited
by Euler’s equation which relates the number of vertices, edges and
faces of polyhedra.

The other serious technical difference between 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions,
that of constructing a Jacobian for transforming from link to plaquette
variables, is relevant to both the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian
formulations of LGT. It only becomes important when the method of choice
relies on plaquette variables for its implementation. The transformation
from link variables to plaquette variables is required in the approach
taken in Chapters \thechapter and \thechapter to make use of the
analytic results available for certain group integrals. Such a
transformation does not need to be made if one is happy to use Monte
Carlo techniques to handle the integrals as is the case in Ref. Chin
et al. ( 1986 ) .

The most complete treatment of the transformation from link to plaquette
variables is due to Batrouni Batrouni ( 1983 , 1982a ) who worked in the
Lagrangian formulation. His approach was based on the continuum work of
Halpern Halpern ( 1979 ) who constructed a field-strength formulation of
gauge theory. In Halpern’s construction the definition of the field
strength @xmath is inverted to give an expression for @xmath as a
function of the field strength. To do this requires the choice of a
suitable gauge. The Jacobian of the transformation is precisely the
Bianchi identity; a constraint equation on @xmath . For the Abelian case
the Bianchi identity is equivalent to the requirement that the total
magnetic flux leaving a volume is zero. Batrouni developed an equivalent
field strength formulation on the lattice. On the lattice, the link
operators, @xmath , correspond to the vector potentials, @xmath , and
the plaquette variables correspond to the field strengths, @xmath .
Batrouni demonstrated that the Jacobian of the transformation from link
variables to plaquette variables was the lattice analogue of the Bianchi
identity. For Abelian gauge theories the lattice Bianchi identity can be
separated into factors which depend only on the plaquette variables of
elementary cubes, with one factor for each cube of the lattice. For
non-abelian theories the Bianchi identity has only been found to
separate in this way for special types of lattices, the largest volume
example being an infinite tower of cubes. For the infinite lattice the
Bianchi identity is a complicated nonlinear inseparable function of
distant plaquette variables. Interestingly it is the only source of
correlations between plaquette variables in LGT. Mean plaquette methods
have been developed to deal with the added complications of the
non-abelian Bianchi identity but have not progressed far Batrouni (
1982b ) .

To summarise, Hamiltonian LGT in 3+1 dimensions faces some serious
problems. Care must be taken in choosing appropriate variables to work
with if constraints on the lattice electric fields are to be avoided.
Additionally, if one wishes to use analytic techniques to calculate
matrix elements the complications of the Bianchi identity restricts the
calculations to small lattices.

### 41 Constraint Equations

In this section we focus on one of the problems faced in moving from 2+1
to 3+1 dimensions, that of Gauss’ law. From the discussion of Section 40
it would seem that one needs either to construct an appropriate set of
variables with precisely the correct number of unconstrained degrees of
freedom or be faced with the problem of building constraint equations on
the lattice electric fields. As has been pointed out by Ligterink, Walet
and Bishop Ligterink et al. ( 2000 ) there is an alternative. The
problem of satisfying Gauss’ law can be solved by working with wave
functions that are annihilated by the generator of Gauss’ law. We
discuss this matter in that which follows.

In the Hamiltonian formulation of LGT we work in the temporal gauge
which sets @xmath . In terms of link variables this is equivalent to
setting all time-like links to the identity. This however is only a
partial gauge fixing; setting @xmath does not completely eliminate the
arbitrariness in the definition of the vector potential, it merely
reduces the set of possible gauge transformations to purely space-like
ones. To see this we revert to continuum gauge theory.

In the continuum one encounters difficulties when attempting to
canonically quantise SU( @xmath ) pure gauge theory Fadeev and Slavnov (
1980 ); Jackiw ( 1997 ) . The difficulties stem from the fact that it is
impossible to define a momentum conjugate to the time-like component of
the vector potential @xmath . This follows from the non-appearance of
@xmath in the Yang-Mills Lagrangian. The simplest way around the problem
is to fix to the temporal gauge @xmath before quantising. The result is
a Hamiltonian whose equations of motion do not mirror those of the
Lagrangian; the non-abelian generalisation of Gauss’ Law,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (283)
  -- -------- -- -------

is absent. One does not need to impose Gauss’ law as a constraint on the
electric fields, @xmath . Defining @xmath , with the usual canonical
commutation relations, it can be shown that @xmath commutes with the
Hamiltonian. Consequently if one chooses to work with states @xmath such
that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (284)
  -- -------- -- -------

then one recovers Gauss’ law ensuring that the physics of the Lagrangian
formulation is recovered.

On the lattice a similar problem arises Ligterink et al. ( 2000 ) . One
must therefore ensure that any state used is annihilated by the
generator of Gauss’ law, in order to recover physical results with
certainty. The generator of Gauss’ law on the lattice can be written as
Kogut and Susskind ( 1975 ); Kogut ( 1980 ) ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (285)
  -- -------- -- -------

In this notation the lattice electric fields satisfy the commutation
relations Kogut ( 1980 )

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (286)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (287)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

It should be pointed out that in this notation we have @xmath . For
physical states we must therefore have @xmath for each lattice site, ,
and all @xmath . It should be checked that this is the case for the
one-plaquette exponential trial state. Consider first a state consisting
of a single plaquette acting on the strong coupling vacuum,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (288)
  -- -------- -- -------

Since @xmath is annihilated by the electric field, using Eqs. ( 286 )
and ( 287 ) we immediately have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (289)
  -- -------- -- -------

for all lattice sites, , not lying on the corners of the plaquette,
@xmath . Consider now sites lying on the corners of the plaquette in
question. In particular consider @xmath . Making use of the commutation
relations of Eqs. ( 286 ) and ( 287 ),

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (290)
                                @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

The same applies for other sites on the plaquette. This argument is not
specific to plaquettes. Gauss’ law is found to be satisfied locally by
any closed Wilson loop on the lattice, traced over colour indices,
acting on the strong coupling vacuum. It is easy to extend this result
to products of such loops acting on @xmath . To see this we consider how
Gauss’ law applies to the product of two plaquettes

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (291)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Only at the sites @xmath and @xmath does this case differ from the
single plaquette example . Let us consider Gauss’ law at @xmath . Once
again, using the fact that the lattice electric field annihilates the
strong coupling vacuum, and Eqs. ( 286 ) and ( 287 ) we have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (292)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

This result is easily extended to arbitrary products of closed Wilson
loops, traced over colour indices, acting on @xmath . Consequently, any
function of such loops acting on @xmath also satisfies Gauss’ law
provided it admits a Taylor series expansion. The one plaquette trial
state thus obeys Gauss’ law and is therefore suitable for use in
simulating physical states.

### 42 The One Cube Universe

In this section we adapt the analytic techniques used with success in
Chapters \thechapter and \thechapter for use in 3+1 dimensions. As a
starting point we consider the case of a single cube. This will serve as
a test case to assess the feasibility of a larger volume study. Our aim
is to use a small basis of states to calculate 3+1 dimensional SU(
@xmath ) glueball masses variationally, and check if an approach to the
correct scaling form is observed. We do not expect to achieve scaling
with such a small lattice. However, an approach to scaling would warrant
an extended study on larger lattices. We start with a general
description of the approach. The starting point is the choice of trial
state. As in 2+1 dimensions we choose to work with the one-plaquette
trial state of Eq. ( 110 ), with the variational parameter again being
fixed by minimising the vacuum energy density of Eq. ( 194 ). In 3+1
dimensions however the expression for the plaquette expectation value in
terms of the variational parameter is significantly more complicated
than for the case of 2+1 dimensions. Having fixed the variational
parameter we then construct a small basis of states, with each state
fitting on a single cube, and minimise the glueball mass over this
basis. The process of minimising the massgap follows precisely Chapter
\thechapter . The key difficulty of working in 3+1 dimensions is the
calculation of the required integrals. In the next section we explain
how an analytic approximation to these integrals can be obtained.

#### 42.1 Su( ) Integrals in 3+1 Dimensions

The analytic techniques used in Chapter \thechapter rely on the fact
that the transformation from link to plaquette variables has unit
Jacobian in 2+1 dimensions. Batrouni has calculated the Jacobian for
arbitrary numbers of dimensions Batrouni ( 1982a , 1983 ) . For a
lattice consisting of a single cube, the result of Ref. Batrouni ( 1982a
) is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (293)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

where @xmath are the six plaquette variables on the single cube and the
sum is over all characters @xmath of SU( @xmath ). The second line is
simply a character expansion of the first line. In the variational study
of glueball masses, we need to calculate the integrals of overlapping
trace variables on a single cube. It is always possible to reduce these
integrals to integrals involving non-overlapping trace variables using
the orthogonality properties of the characters. For example, consider
the expectation value, on a single cube, of a twice covered bent
rectangle, with respect to the one-plaquette trial state of Eq. ( 110 ),

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (294)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

To proceed with this integral we need to perform character expansions.
The orthogonality of the characters can then be used to write characters
over two plaquettes in terms of one-plaquette characters. To demonstrate
how this is done we consider the character expansion of one of the
integrals in Eq. ( 294 ),

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (295)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Here the @xmath are given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (296)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Making use of the orthogonality of characters, given by Eq. ( 208 ), we
obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (297)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Making use of this and proceeding similarly for the analogous integral
involving @xmath , we can reduce Eq. ( 294 ) to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (298)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

The plaquette matrix element provides a more straightforward example;

  -- -- -- -------
           (299)
  -- -- -- -------

To proceed further we need expressions for the integrals over characters
that appear in each matrix element of interest. We define these
character integrals generically by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (300)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

All SU( @xmath ) integrals encountered in the calculation of glueball
masses in 3+1 dimensions can be expressed in terms of character
integrals. It is possible to calculate them generally, however three
points need to be considered. Firstly, if we are to use the machinery of
Chapter \thechapter , we need to know how to express a given character
in terms of trace variables. Secondly, as the dimension of the gauge
group increases the number of independent trace variables increases
rapidly. In order to contain the number of integrals required for a
given order of approximation, it is necessary to express all high order
trace variables in terms of a basis of lower order ones. Finally, the
collection of SU( @xmath ) integrals presented in Chapter \thechapter
must be extended. We now address each of these points in turn.

The problem of expressing the characters of SU( @xmath ) in terms of
trace variables was solved by Bars Bars ( 1980 ) who showed that for SU(
@xmath ),

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (301)
  -- -------- -- -------

General characters can then be expressed in terms of @xmath using
standard techniques from group theory Weyl ( 1946 ) ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (302)
  -- -------- -- -------

For a given character, Eq. ( 302 ) produces a multinomial of traces of
different powers of @xmath . However, not all of these trace variables
are independent. The so called Mandelstam constraints define the
relationship between dependent trace variables. For SU(2) and SU(3) we
have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (303)
  -- -------- -- -------

Similar relations can be obtained to express all trace variables in
terms of @xmath for SU(2), and for SU(3) in terms of @xmath and @xmath .
To reduce the calculation of character integrals to a manageable size,
we require expressions for high power trace variables in terms of a
minimal set of lower order trace variables. To do this we proceed as
follows. We start with an alternative expression of @xmath , satisfied
for all SU( @xmath ) matrices @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (304)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here the colour indices of the group elements have been made explicit
and all repeated indices are summed over. Multiplying Levi-Civita
symbols produces sums of products of delta functions, the precise form
of which depends on how many pairs of indices are contracted. A standard
result from differential geometry will be useful here,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (305)
  -- -------- -- -------

Multiplying both sides of Eq. ( 304 ) by @xmath and contracting over
repeated indices gives

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (306)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

In the last line we have renamed dummy indices and multiplied both sides
by a Levi-Civita symbol. Making use of Eq. ( 305 ) in Eq. ( 306 )
produces a product of delta functions on each side of the equation. By
introducing appropriate combinations of delta functions and contracting
over repeated indices we can construct trace identities as we please. We
find that identities useful in our context are produced by the
introduction of delta functions and an additional matrix, @xmath , which
is not necessarily an element of SU( @xmath ), into Eq. ( 306 ) as
follows:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (307)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here we have again renamed dummy indices. Some examples of SU( @xmath )
identities obtained from Eq. ( 307 ) valid for all @xmath matrices
@xmath are as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath                        
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (308)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

We require formulae for @xmath in terms of lower order trace variables
for SU( @xmath ). Such formulae, known commonly as Mandelstam
constraints, are obtained by setting @xmath in Eq. ( 307 ). In Appendix
\thechapter we list the Mandelstam constraints obtained in this way up
to SU(8). We see that for SU( @xmath ) it is possible to express all
characters in terms of @xmath trace variables. In what follows we will
choose to express the general SU( @xmath ) characters in terms of the
set of trace variables, @xmath . It may well be possible to reduce the
size of this set. This would indeed improve the efficiency of our
technique. However, no effort has been made to do this at this stage.

The procedure for calculating the general character integral, @xmath ,
is then as follows. We first express the characters @xmath in terms of
trace variables using Eqs. ( 301 ) and ( 302 ). We then simplify these
expressions using the Mandelstam constraints of Appendix \thechapter .
The final step is to perform the integrals over trace variables, which
is an increasingly non-trivial task as one increases the dimension of
the gauge group. For instance, the general character integral for SU(
@xmath ) involves integrals over powers of the trace variables @xmath .
To proceed we need the following integral,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (309)
  -- -------- -- -------

For SU( @xmath ), the cases of interest to us here are described by,
@xmath . To calculate this integral we need to extend the work of
Chapter \thechapter and consider the generating function,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (310)
  -- -------- -- -------

Following the procedure of Chapter \thechapter we obtain,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (311)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

with,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (312)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

We then obtain an expression for @xmath by differentiating @xmath
appropriately;

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (313)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

#### 42.2 The Variational Ground State

In this section we fix the variational ground state following the usual
procedure of minimising the unimproved vacuum energy density given by
Eq. ( 194 ) with @xmath . This equation is independent of the number of
dimensions. The dimensionality of the lattice arises at the stage of
calculating the plaquette expectation value.

Making use of Eq. ( 299 ), the variational parameter can be fixed as a
function of @xmath for the one-cube lattice. In practice, the character
sum in Eq. ( 299 ) and the infinite @xmath -sum in Eq. ( 311 ) need to
be truncated. We truncate the infinite @xmath -sum at @xmath and instead
of summing over all SU( @xmath ) characters, we sum over only those
characters, @xmath , with @xmath . With this truncation scheme, memory
constraints restrict calculations of the variational SU( @xmath ) ground
state to @xmath , when working with @xmath and @xmath on a desktop
computer.

The dependence of the variational parameter on @xmath with @xmath is
shown for various gauge groups in Fig. 40 . As @xmath increases the
variational parameter appears to converge for each @xmath considered.
Moreover the convergence appears to improve as the dimension of the
gauge group is increased. With the exception of SU(3), the @xmath and 2
results are indistinguishable on the range @xmath , where @xmath . As
this is the range of interest to us later in the chapter we restrict
further calculations to @xmath .

The SU( @xmath ) variational parameters on the one-cube lattice with
@xmath and @xmath are shown for various @xmath in Fig. 41 . The results
do not differ greatly. The corresponding variational energy densities
are shown in Fig. 42 .

#### 42.3 Expressions for the Glueball Mass

We follow precisely the method described in Section 30 for the
calculation of 3+1 dimensional glueball masses on a single cube. Here,
however, we choose a different basis of states to minimise over. Instead
of rectangular loops, we use states which fit on a single cube. We start
with a basis of two states, the plaquettes and the bent rectangles,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (314)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

with

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (315)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -------- -- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath         
     @xmath   @xmath         (316)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- -------

In 3+1 dimensions, the “+” sign corresponds to the @xmath state and the
“ @xmath ” sign corresponds to the @xmath state Hamer ( 1989 ) . In
order to calculate the glueball masses, we need expressions for the
matrix elements @xmath and @xmath of Eqs. ( 198 ) and ( 199 )
respectively. Here the superscript, @xmath , denotes the charge
conjugation eigenvalue, @xmath , of the state in question. Making use of
Eq. ( 209 ) and carefully counting the number of possible overlaps
between different loops we arrive at

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath                     
     @xmath   @xmath                     
     @xmath   @xmath                     
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (317)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Here we have introduced the notation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (318)
  -- -------- -- -------

The combinatorics which lead to the coefficients in the matrix elements
in Eq. ( 317 ) are a result of counting the possible overlaps within a
single cube. The remaining matrix elements @xmath and @xmath can be
calculated similarly, resulting in

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath                     
                       @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath                     (319)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Having calculated @xmath and @xmath , we follow the minimisation
procedure described in Chapter \thechapter to arrive at the glueball
mass, @xmath .

#### 42.4 Results

In this section we present calculations of the @xmath (symmetric) and
@xmath (antisymmetric) glueball masses on the one-cube lattice for SU(
@xmath ) with @xmath . We first define the rescaled glueball mass,
@xmath , corresponding to @xmath as follows:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (320)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here, as usual, @xmath and @xmath denote the parity and charge
conjugation eigenvalues of the state in question. From the discussion
Section 8 asymptotic scaling of a glueball mass is observed if the
corresponding rescaled glueball mass becomes constant for some range of
couplings.

The results for the rescaled symmetric glueball mass are shown in Fig.
43 . Fig. 43(a) shows the rescaled glueball mass calculated with only
plaquettes in the minimisation basis. Fig. 43(b) shows the same quantity
calculated with the minimisation basis of Eq. ( 314 ). The aim of this
exploratory study is to observe whether or not a move toward scaling is
apparent as the number of states in the minimisation basis is increased.
This is clearly not the case for the symmetric glueball mass on the
range of couplings explored here. There is no sign of @xmath becoming
constant on any range of couplings within @xmath .

The prospects are marginally better for the antisymmetric case. The
results for the rescaled antisymmetric glueball mass are displayed in
Fig. 44 . A move toward scaling is observed, most clearly for the @xmath
case, near @xmath . This matches the region of couplings for which Chin,
Long and Robson observed scaling of the @xmath glueball mass, for @xmath
and 6, on a @xmath lattice using only plaquettes in their minimisation
basis Chin et al. ( 1986 ) .

#### 42.5 String Tension

If the exploratory study presented here was to be extended to larger
lattices, at some stage it would be useful to compute the string
tension, @xmath . It is common for calculations in Lagrangian LGT to
express results for masses in units of @xmath . This allows masses
calculated on the lattice to be expressed in MeV since the string
tension can be calculated in MeV from the decay of heavy quarkonia for
example. In the Hamiltonian formulation, precise calculations of the
string tension have only been performed in the strong coupling regime.
Variational estimates, at least for SU(2) Arisue et al. ( 1983 ) , have
not exhibited asymptotic scaling when making use of the one-plaquette
ground state of Eq. ( 110 ). It is possible that the situation may be
improved for higher dimensional gauge groups but this has not yet been
tested.

In this section we calculate the symmetric and antisymmetric glueball
masses in units of @xmath . For the string tension, since reliable
variational results are not available, we use the strong coupling
expansions of Kogut and Shigemitsu Kogut and Shigemitsu ( 1980 ) . These
are available for SU(5) and SU(6), as well as SU(2) and SU(3) which we
do not consider here.

Since the square root of the string tension has units of mass, the ratio
of a mass to the string tension is constant in a scaling region. Again,
with the crude model presented here, we do not expect to observe
scaling. We seek only an indication of an approach to scaling. Such
behaviour would warrant further study.

The results for the symmetric states are shown in Fig. 45 . Since we
perform calculations with two states in the minimisation basis, the two
lowest mass states are accessible. In Fig. 45(a) the results for the
lowest mass state are shown. Calculations with different minimisation
bases are shown, with the “SU @xmath -plaquettes” label indicating that
only plaquette states are used. For each case the glueball mass has a
local minimum in the range @xmath . The various results do not differ
greatly. There is no sign of improved scaling behaviour when either bent
rectangles are included or @xmath is increased. The effect of including
bent rectangles is to lower the local minimum.

The second lowest glueball mass is shown in Fig. 45(b) . Again, no
improvement in scaling behaviour is seen as @xmath is increased. In Fig.
45 the horizontal lines indicate the 3+1 dimensional SU(5) calculations
(and error bars) of Lucini and Teper Lucini and Teper ( 2001 ) .
Interestingly, both masses calculated here with a simplistic model, have
minima that lie within the error bars.

We now move on to the antisymmetric states. The results for the
antisymmetric glueball masses in units of @xmath are shown in Fig. 46 .
The results are more promising than the symmetric case. We see an
improved approach to scaling when bent rectangles are included in the
minimisation basis for the lowest glueball mass. For this case the
glueball mass shows promising signs of becoming constant in the ranges
@xmath for SU(6) and @xmath for SU(5). Only marginal improvement in
scaling behaviour is evident as @xmath is increased from 5 to 6. For
each of these cases no data is available for comparison to our
knowledge. Such promising signs are not apparent in the second lowest
glueball mass in this sector, as seen in Fig. 46(b) .

It would be interesting to perform analogous calculations for SU(7), for
which the most promising results were displayed in Section 42.4 .
However strong coupling expansions for the SU(7) string tension are not
available in Ref. Kogut and Shigemitsu ( 1980 ) and have not been
published elsewhere to our knowledge.

### 43 Future Work

In this chapter we have studied the variational @xmath and @xmath
glueball masses on a single cube in 3+1 dimensions. Our intention was to
determine the viability of using analytic Hamiltonian methods in 3+1
dimensional glueball mass calculations. With such a crude small volume
approximation and a minimisation basis containing only two states, the
observation of asymptotic scaling was not expected. Promising signs of
an approach to asymptotic scaling were displayed by the @xmath glueball
mass, as @xmath was increased, at couplings close to the scaling window
observed by a comparable, but larger volume, study by Chin, Long and
Robson Chin et al. ( 1986 ) . Interesting results were also observed for
calculations of the glueball masses in units of the string tension. With
no variational results for the string tension available, the strong
coupling results of Kogut and Shigemitsu Kogut and Shigemitsu ( 1980 )
were used. Interestingly, the mass of both SU(5) @xmath glueball states
calculated had minima which were consistent with the Lagrangian
calculation of Lucini and Teper Lucini and Teper ( 2001 ) . Better
scaling behaviour was exhibited by the SU(5) and SU(6) @xmath states,
although no alternative calculations are available for comparison to our
knowledge. For the lowest mass @xmath states calculated, the scaling
behaviour was improved by increasing the number of states in the
minimisation basis and the dimension of the gauge group. The promising
results observed in this chapter warrant further study on larger
lattices, with additional states in the minimisation basis.

To extend this calculation to larger lattices and minimisation bases,
two challenges will be faced. Firstly, the correct implementation of the
Bianchi identity, within our plaquette based analytic approach, forces
the number of integration variables to grow quickly with the volume. New
approaches to handling the general character integrals may need to be
developed in order to avoid the inevitable memory restrictions.
Secondly, great care will need to be taken in the counting of overlaps
between different states. This process could, in principle, be automated
using techniques from graph theory and symbolic programming.

It would also be of interest to extend the calculation presented here to
larger @xmath . To do this a more efficient technique for handling the
general character integrals would need to be developed to minimise the
memory demands of the calculation. The following is just one
possibility. It is likely, that by expressing the products of characters
appearing in the character integrals as sums of characters, one could
reduce the memory requirements of the calculation drastically. The
general character integrals could then be expressed in terms of
integrals of the form,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (321)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath labels a representation of SU( @xmath ). Having completed
the calculations presented in this chapter, it was discovered that
@xmath can be handled using the techniques of Chapter \thechapter , with
the result,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (322)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

The final stage of this improvement would be to find a convenient way to
express the products of characters appearing in the calculation as a sum
of characters. This would be possible with the symbolic manipulation of
Young tableaux.

## Chapter \thechapter Conclusion

This thesis has been concerned with the study of two topics: improvement
and the use of analytic techniques in Hamiltonian LGT. In this chapter
we summarise our key results and discuss the directions that further
work should take.

Chapters \thechapter and \thechapter were concerned primarily with the
issue of improvement. In Chapter \thechapter a technique allowing the
straightforward construction of lattice Hamiltonians was developed.
Using this direct approach a number of improved Hamiltonians were
derived. The key advantage of our approach is that it allows the
straightforward construction of improved kinetic Hamiltonians with a
finite number of terms, a task that has proved nontrivial in the past.
In Chapter \thechapter two simple tests of improvement, a strong
coupling calculation of the U(1) Callan-Symanzik @xmath function in 3+1
dimensions and a mean field calculation of the SU(2) lattice specific
heat in 2+1 dimensions, were presented. For each example considered, the
tadpole improved Hamiltonians (when they were used) achieved the
greatest level of improvement followed by the classically improved
Hamiltonians and then the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonians.

In Chapter \thechapter , techniques which allow the analytic calculation
of SU( @xmath ) matrix elements in 2+1 dimensions were developed. This
chapter generalised the methods that have been employed in variational
SU(2) LGT calculations for almost 20 years, to the general case of SU(
@xmath ). A close connection with the fields of random matrices and
combinatorics was also discussed.

In Chapter \thechapter , the analytic techniques of Chapter \thechapter
were applied in the calculation of @xmath and 5 glueball masses in 2+1
dimensions. Kogut-Susskind, improved and tadpole improved Hamiltonians,
all of which were derived in Chapter \thechapter , were used and their
results compared. For each case considered, the lowest mass results
obtained were considerably higher than the lowest glueball masses
obtained by comparable Hamiltonian and Lagrangian calculations. However,
the lowest mass states obtained in the @xmath and @xmath sectors were
close in mass to the respective excited states, @xmath and @xmath , of
Teper and Lucini Teper ( 1999 ); Lucini and Teper ( 2002 ) . In the
@xmath sector this agreement improved as @xmath was increased, and for
each @xmath the agreement was closer for the improved calculations. This
situation was replicated in the @xmath sector if the SU(4) results were
excluded. For SU(4), the lowest unimproved glueball mass was closer to
the mass of Teper and Lucini’s @xmath state than the improved results.
The problem of enumerating states can be attributed to the fact that the
calculations presented in Chapter \thechapter used a basis of
rectangular states. The competing calculations incorporate additional
nonrectangular states. Without the inclusion of small area,
nonrectangular states in the calculation, it is possible that some low
mass states are inaccessible. Further calculations, which include
nonrectangular states in the minimisation basis, are needed to clarify
this issue. Including such additional states will also allow spin 1 and
@xmath states to be studied, and permit a more complete study of the
spin 0 and 2 glueball mass spectra.

In Chapter \thechapter we presented the first steps of a study of the
SU( @xmath ) glueball mass spectrum in the large @xmath limit using the
techniques of Chapter \thechapter . Our motivation was the Maldacena
conjecture which, in its simplest form, predicts a precise
correspondence between certain string theories and gauge theories in the
large @xmath limit. Using analytic Hamiltonian techniques, calculations
with @xmath as large as 25 were possible on a desktop computer, in
contrast to comparable Lagrangian calculations which have reached @xmath
. With such large @xmath glueball masses accessible, reliable
extrapolations to the @xmath were possible. The results provided
evidence for leading order @xmath finite @xmath corrections to the
glueball masses, verifying a specific prediction of large @xmath gauge
theory.

In Chapter \thechapter we moved on to the physically interesting case of
3+1 dimensions. There we studied the viability of adapting the analytic
techniques used with success in Chapters \thechapter and \thechapter to
3+1 dimensions. A simple variational calculation of @xmath and @xmath
glueball masses was carried out on a single cube, with only two states
in the minimisation basis. With such a simplistic approximation
asymptotic scaling was not expected. However, it was hoped that with the
use of analytic Hamiltonian techniques, large values of @xmath could be
reached. This was not the case, with memory constraints restricting
calculations to @xmath on a one cube lattice. Our motivation for
attempting this calculation was a variational Hamiltonian study by Chin,
Long and Robson Chin et al. ( 1986 ) which demonstrated asymptotic
scaling of the @xmath glueball mass on a @xmath lattice for @xmath and
6, with improved scaling observed as @xmath was increased. Promising
signs of an approach to asymptotic scaling were observed in Chapter
\thechapter for the @xmath state, in the same region of couplings as
scaling was seen by Chin, Long and Robson. No such signs were observed
for the @xmath state. The extension to larger lattices thus seems
warranted. Such extensions will be hampered by memory constraints unless
new techniques for handling the general character integrals are
developed. Another important improvement, which does not pose a serious
problem, will be the inclusion of more states in the minimisation basis.
The applicability of analytic variational techniques in 3+1 dimensions
will thus be determined by how quickly the infinite volume limit is
reached.

While we have derived various improved Hamiltonians and put them to use
in glueball mass calculations in 2+1 dimensions, their use in 3+1
dimensional non-abelian LGT is untested. The next stages of a 3+1
dimensional calculation, within the variational analytic approach
presented here, would incorporate improved Hamiltonians and move beyond
a single cube. It is possible that in such a calculation the use of an
improved Hamiltonian could mean the difference between observing and not
observing scaling on the range of couplings available.

The results of this thesis demonstrate that the analytic techniques of
Hamiltonian LGT can compete with the traditional Monte Carlo techniques
of Lagrangian LGT, at least in the calculation of glueball masses in 2+1
dimensions. The use of the analytic techniques presented here are by no
means restricted to variational calculations. It is possible that they
will find use in coupled cluster calculations, or in the moment
calculations of the plaquette expansion method Hollenberg ( 1993 ) . The
move to 3+1 dimensions is formidable but the calculations of Chapter
\thechapter suggest that analytic techniques may by feasible, at least
for large @xmath , provided the infinite volume limit is reached
quickly.
