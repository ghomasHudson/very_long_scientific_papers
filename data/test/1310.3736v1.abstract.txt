related counter-parts, and be naively related to respectively small and
large distance regimes. Instead, the UV sector will simply be the corner
of parameter space responsible for divergences, or equivalently where
’most’ of the degrees of freedom sit. A natural renormalization group
flow will be defined, which will allow to average out the contributions
of the degrees of freedom, from higher to lower scales. The only strong
conceptual assumption we will make in this respect is that such an
abstract definition of renormalization is physical and can be used to
describe the emergence of space-time structures. However, at this
general level of discussion, we would like to convey the idea that such
a strong assumption is in a sense also minimal. Indeed, if one wants to
be able to speak of emergence of space and time, one also needs at least
one new parameter which is neither time nor space. We simply call this
order parameter ’scale’, and identify it with one of the central
features of quantum field theory: the renormalization group. It is in
our view the most direct route towards new physics in the absence of
space and time, as quantum gravity seems to require.
