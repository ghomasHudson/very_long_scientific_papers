The main results of this Section are that Anandan and Aharonov
recognized @xmath as the differential of a well established metric, the
Fubini-Study metric. This allowed the bound to be reinterpreted as
stating that the length of any path is greater than or equal to the
distance between its endpoints. The (finite) distance measured by this
metric is @xmath , whereas the length is the integral of @xmath , and so
the inequality is proved in geometric terms. Saturation occurs on
geodesic paths, where the length equals the distance between the
endpoints.

We end this Section with a simple analogy. The quantity @xmath is the
speed of evolution. It is analogous to what is measured by the
speedometer of a car, in that it does not distinguish the direction of
the path in any way. Given a traveled course, the information given by
the speedometer allows one to calculate the traveled length @xmath along
the path and, furthermore, the time @xmath it takes to travel such
length. Since the actual straight-line (geodesic) distance @xmath
between starting and finish points may not be greater than the length (
@xmath ), @xmath is a lower bound on the time needed to become @xmath
apart from the starting point. Only if the path is traveled in a
straight line do length and distance coincide.
