From the eight fixed points presented in the quintessence (phantom)
case, only (a) and (c) are physically viable and they describe the
sequence: radiation @xmath matter. Both of them are unstable, however,
there does not exist a point that describe the dark-energy-dominated
universe. Thus the extra degree of freedom due to the phase @xmath
spoils the physically acceptable fixed points that exist for the case of
real scalar field, indicating that the dynamical system theory is not a
good tool when one tries to analyze the complex quintessence (phantom).
