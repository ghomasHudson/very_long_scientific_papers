Aspects of Supersymmetric Gauge Theory and String Theory

Supervisor: Vijay Balasubramanian

This thesis consists of two parts. In the first part we study some
topics in @xmath supersymmeric gauge theory and the relation to matrix
models. We review the relevant non-perturbative techniques for computing
effective superpotential, such as Seiberg-Witten curve. Then we review
the proposal of Dijkgraaf and Vafa that relates the glueball
superpotentials to the computation in matrix models. We then consider a
case of multi-trace superpotential. We perform the perturbative
computation of glueball superpotential in this case and explain the
subtlety in identifying the glueball superfield. We also use these
techniques to study phases of @xmath gauge theory with flavors.

In the second part we study topics in AdS/CFT correspondence and its
plane wave limit. We review the plane wave geometry and BMN operators
that corresponding to string modes. Then we study string interactions in
the case of a highly curved plane wave background, and demonstrate the
agreements between calculations of string interaction amplitudes in the
two dual theories. Finally we study D3-brane giant gravitons and open
string attached to them. Giant gravitons are non-perturbative objects
that have very large R-charge.
