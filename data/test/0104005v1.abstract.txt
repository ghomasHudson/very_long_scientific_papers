Non-perturbative renormalization of lattice composite operators plays a
crucial role in many applications of lattice field theory. We sketch the
general problems involved in this task and the methods which are
currently used to cope with them. We present a detailed investigation of
a new approach based on the operator product expansion. We test the new
method on the two-dimensional @xmath @xmath -model and discuss its
advantages and limitations.
