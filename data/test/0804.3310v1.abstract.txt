This thesis describes some of the recent (and some less recent)
developments in calculational techniques for scattering amplitudes in
quantum field theory. The focus is on on-shell recursion relations in
complex momenta and on the use of unitarity methods for loop
calculations. In particular, on-shell recursion is related to the MHV
rules for computing tree-level gauge amplitudes and used to extend the
MHV rules to graviton scattering. Combinations of unitarity cut
techniques and recursion are used to argue for the “No-Triangle
Hypothesis” in @xmath supergravity which is related to its UV behaviour.
Finally, combinations of unitarity and recursion are used to demonstrate
the full calculation of a one-loop amplitude involving a Higgs particle
and four gluons in the limit of large top mass. The present version is
edited to incorporate some of the comments and suggestions of the
evaluation committee, but has not been updated for developments in the
meantime.
