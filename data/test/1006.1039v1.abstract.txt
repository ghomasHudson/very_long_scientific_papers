In this thesis we study different aspects of noncommutativity in quantum mechanics, field theory and gravity. We give particular emphasis on the underlying symmetries of these theories. Deformations of usual symmetries like the external space time symmetries and the internal gauge symmetry in noncommutative theories are analyzed in detail.
