Shape dynamics is a classical theory of gravity which agrees with
general relativity in many important cases, but possesses different
gauge symmetries and constraints. Rather than spacetime diffeomorphism
invariance, shape dynamics takes spatial diffeomorphism invariance and
spatial Weyl invariance as the fundamental gauge symmetries associated
with the gravitational field. Despite these differences, shape dynamics
and general relativity generically predict the same dynamics—there exist
gauge-fixings of each theory that ensure agreement with the other.
However, these gauge-fixing conditions are not necessarily globally
well-defined and it is therefore possible to find solutions of the shape
dynamics equations of motion that agree with general relativity on some
open neighborhoods, but which have different global structures. In
particular, the black hole solutions of the two theories disagree
globally. Understanding these novel “shape dynamic black holes” is the
primary goal of this thesis.
