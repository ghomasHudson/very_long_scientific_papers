Many emerging applications involve sparse signals, and their processing
is a subject of active research. We desire a large class of sensing
matrices which allow the user to discern important properties of the
measured sparse signal. Of particular interest are matrices with the
restricted isometry property (RIP). RIP matrices are known to enable
efficient and stable reconstruction of sufficiently sparse signals, but
the deterministic construction of such matrices has proven very
difficult. In this thesis, we discuss this matrix design problem in the
context of a growing field of study known as frame theory. In the first
two chapters, we build large families of equiangular tight frames and
full spark frames, and we discuss their relationship to RIP matrices as
well as their utility in other aspects of sparse signal processing. In
Chapter 3, we pave the road to deterministic RIP matrices, evaluating
various techniques to demonstrate RIP, and making interesting
connections with graph theory and number theory. We conclude in
Chapter 4 with a coherence-based alternative to RIP, which provides
near-optimal probabilistic guarantees for various aspects of sparse
signal processing while at the same time admitting a whole host of
deterministic constructions.
