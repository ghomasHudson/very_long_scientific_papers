This article surveys many standard results about the braid group with
emphasis on simplifying the usual algebraic proofs.

We use van der Waerden’s trick to illuminate the Artin-Magnus proof of
the classic presentation of the algebraic mapping-class group of a
punctured disc.

We give a simple, new proof of the Dehornoy-Larue braid-group
trichotomy, and, hence, recover the Dehornoy right-ordering of the braid
group.

We then turn to the Birman-Hilden theorem concerning braid-group actions
on free products of cyclic groups, and the consequences derived by
Perron-Vannier, and the connections with the Wada representations. We
recall the very simple Crisp-Paris proof of the Birman-Hilden theorem
that uses the Larue-Shpilrain technique. Studying ends of free groups
permits a deeper understanding of the braid group; this gives us a
generalization of the Birman-Hilden theorem. Studying Jordan curves in
the punctured disc permits a still deeper understanding of the braid
group; this gave Larue, in his PhD thesis, correspondingly deeper
results, and, in an appendix, we recall the essence of Larue’s thesis,
giving simpler combinatorial proofs.
