## Chapter 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Introduction to Cosmology

The quest of knowing the beginning, the evolution and the ultimate fate
of the Universe is the prime motivation of the subject of cosmology.

Earlier, it was believed that we occupy a very special location in the
Universe and it was believed to be the centre of the Universe. But in
modern cosmology, this idea has been abandoned. We are at a place which
is no way special than the other places in the Universe. This simple and
reasonable idea is called the cosmological principle .

It is important to note that the viability of the cosmological principle
depends upon the length scale of interest. Even if the length scale is
of the order of that of a single galaxy (10 to 100 kpc, where 1 pc =
3.0857 @xmath meters or 3.26 light-years), this principle lacks the
viability. But observations indicate quite strongly that at a length
scale of 10 Mpc or more, which is still 3 order of magnitude less than
the visible Universe, the cosmological principle appears to be true with
a great accuracy.

The standard Big Bang picture represents the Universe as an evolving
entity, the present Universe has actually evolved from a condition
different from what prevails now. This evolving picture of the Universe
is highly supported by the cosmological observations which practically
rule out stationary models of the Universe.

Cosmological principle implies important properties, spatial homogeneity
and isotropy of the Universe. Homogeneity states that the Universe is
similar at every spatial points and isotropy states that the Universe is
similar in all spatial directions.

Edwin Hubble, in 1929, observed a redshift in the spectral line of
nearby galaxies and nebula and concluded that those objects are moving
away from each other. Hubble expressed the velocity of recession (
@xmath ) to be proportional to the distance of the object ( @xmath ),

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the proportionality constant @xmath is called the Hubble constant.
This is known as the Hubble’s law . It is the pioneering observation
which advocates the time evolution of the Universe.

##### Friedmann Cosmology

The mathematical framework of cosmology is mainly based on the the way
of defining the distance between two points in the Universe at
cosmological scale. Let us consider a coordinate system where the
coordinate separation between two points is @xmath , then the real
distance between these two points are

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the @xmath , called the scale factor , takes care of the time
evolution of the real distance. As the Universe expands, the real
distance increases, even between two comoving objects for whom the
coordinate distance ( @xmath ) remains the same. The idea of homogeneity
ensures that the scale factor @xmath is only a function of time.

The most general way of defining the line element, which satisfies the
cosmological principle, is the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric
c1 ; c2 ; c3 ; c4 , which is written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is cosmic time and ( @xmath ) are the spatial coordinates
and @xmath is the curvature parameter which determines the nature of the
spatial geometry.

Along with the cosmological principle, two other basic assumption in the
modelling of the Universe are, (i) general relativity is the correct
theory of gravity, and (ii) the matter distribution of the Universe can
be represented as ideal fluid. Einstein’s field equations which are the
key equations of general relativity, are written as,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the Einstein tensor, @xmath is the Ricci tensor, @xmath
is the Ricci scalar and @xmath is the energy momentum tensor.
Introducing the FRW metric to the Einstein’s field equations ( 1.4 ),
one arrives at the two basic equations of cosmology,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

These are known as the Friedmann equations. Here, @xmath and @xmath are
respectively the energy density and pressure of perfect fluid for which
the energy momentum tensor is @xmath .

The Hubble parameter, which is the fractional rate of expansion of the
linear size of the Universe, is defined as,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

The Friedmann equations can be written in terms of Hubble parameter and
its derivatives as,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

From contracted Bianchi identity ( @xmath ), the continuity equation
yields,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

The energy density ( @xmath ) and pressure ( @xmath ) are related
through an equation called the equation of state, @xmath , where the
@xmath is called the equation of state parameter. For pressureless dust
matter the equation of state parameter @xmath and for a distribution of
photons, the value of equation of state parameter is @xmath . For a
certain component, if the equation of state parameter @xmath is known,
the dependence of the energy density ( @xmath ) upon the scale factor (
@xmath ) can be determined. For instance, dust matter density @xmath ,
radiation or photon energy density @xmath .

Now let us define a quantity called the critical density as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

From equation ( 1.8 ),

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . If the energy density of the Universe is exactly equal to
the critical density, then the curvature parameter @xmath , that means
that spatial geometry is flat. If @xmath , then the value of @xmath is
positive and it can be scaled as @xmath . Similarly for @xmath , the
value of @xmath is negative and it can be scaled as @xmath . For @xmath
, the spatial geometry of the Universe is closed and for @xmath , the
spatial geometry if open.

Observations suggest that the geometry of the spatial part of the
Universe is very close to be flat, i.e. @xmath komatsuWMAP ; planck2013
; planck2015 . It is theoretically argued that the flatness of spatial
geometry of the Universe is a consequence of an early inflation. The
idea is that the rapid expansion during the inflation washed out the
spatial curvature.

##### Cosmological redshift, luminosity distance and angular diameter
distance

As the electromagnetic radiation or photon can travel a finite distance
in the time equal to the age of the Universe, we can only see a certain
part of the Universe. It is known as the observable Universe .

Due to the expansion of the Universe, the wavelength of radiated photon
increases. The photon wavelength is proportional to the scale factor,
i.e. @xmath . Now the redshift of photon is defined as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

which leads to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is scale factor at present (when the photon is observed)
and @xmath is the scale factor when the photon was emitted. It is
convenient to use the redshift ( @xmath ), instead of cosmic time @xmath
in the study of the late time dynamics of the Universe as @xmath is
dimensionless quantity.

The luminosity distance is a way of representing the observed photon
flux from a distant object. It is not exactly the actual or the physical
distance of the object from the observer. Let us consider an object with
a total power output @xmath , where @xmath be the luminosity, that is
the energy emitted per unit solid angle. The radiation flux ( @xmath )
is the amount of energy received per unit area per unit time. The
distance (which is actually the luminosity distance @xmath ), of the
object and the observed photon flux can be connected through the
following equation,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

Hence the luminosity distance is defined as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

In a static Universe, the luminosity distance is exactly equal to the
physical distance ( @xmath ) of the object from the observer. As the
Universe expands, the energy loss of the of the photon is proportional
to @xmath , and the observed photon becomes less frequent which is also
proportional to @xmath . Thus the final relation between the luminosity
distance ( @xmath ) and physical distance ( @xmath ) yield as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

or,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is clear from the relation (equation ( 1.18 )), that for a nearby
object (i.e. @xmath ), @xmath . However, an object at a long distance
seems to be farther away than it really is ( @xmath ).

Angular diameter distance is a distance estimated from the appearance of
an object in angular extent. If an object of physical extent ’ @xmath ’
be observed at an angle @xmath , then the angular diameter distance is
written as (assuming the object lies perpendicular to the line of
sight),

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now the angular diameter distance can be written as, @xmath , where
@xmath be the coordinate distance and @xmath be the scale factor at the
time of photon emission. The physical distance is @xmath . Thus the
relation between @xmath and @xmath can be written as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is interesting to note that the that for a distant object @xmath ,
that means a distant object appears to be larger at angular extent.

The relation between luminosity distance ( @xmath ) and angular diameter
distance ( @xmath ) is,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

The luminosity distance is related to the observed photon flux and
angular diameter distance is related to the appearance of an object at
angular extent. For a nearby object ( @xmath ), both the luminosity
distance and angular diameter distance are equal to the physical
distance of the object from the observer.

##### Success and problems of standard cosmology

As it has already been mentioned that observations suggest that the
Universe is an evolving entity rather than a stationary one. The
evolution picture of the Universe is developed from the Bag Bang model
based on the theory of general relativity. The success of the Big Bang
model is based on three observational facts, the expansion of the
Universe, the abundance of light element in the Universe and the
presence of the relic blackbody radiation called the cosmic microwave
background (CMB). There are certainly other very important successes of
the model.

The expansion of the Universe was first observed by Hubble (in 1929)
from the redshift measurement of distance galaxies. The fact that
galaxies are moving away from each other, that is the Universe is
expanding, gives a big justification of the Big Bang cosmology.

The abundance of light elements in the Universe can be well explained by
the Big Bang cosmology. At the very beginning, the temperature of the
Universe was much higher than the binding energy of atoms or nuclei. Due
to the expansion of the Universe, the temperature gradually decreases
and at a temperature well below the binding energy of typical nuclei,
the formation of light element started. This scenario is dubbed as the
Big Bang Nucleosynthesis . For the conditions of the early Universe and
the relevant nuclear scattering-crossections, the relative abundance of
different element can be estimated. This matches the observed relative
abundance of different elements in the Universe with great accuracy.
This is another big success of the Big Bang cosmology.

The most astounding success of the Big Bang model is the prediction of
cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation alpherherman . These are the
relic photons that decoupled from the baryonic matter when neutral
hydrogen atoms formed at the era of recombination at redshift @xmath .
This was detected in 1965 by Penzias and Wilson penziascmb . This CMB is
very highly isotropic black body radiation and acts as the most powerful
probe of the Universe.

Though these observations have brought enormous success to the standard
Big Bang cosmology, there are certain issues which can not be explained
by it. The tiny fluctuation in the observed CMB temperature and the
source of initial perturbation in the matter distribution, which led to
the formation of large scale structure in the Universe, can not be
explained by the Big Bang model. The early inflation, which is the very
rapid expansion of the Universe just after Big Bang (from @xmath to
@xmath ), is essential to explain the flatness problem and horizon
problem ( detail discussions are in the next section ) in cosmology. The
recent surprise is the alleged accelerated expansion of the Universe at
present epoch. The Big Bang model does not have any viable explanation
about genesis of these two phases of accelerated expansion of the
Universe. The existence of dark matter , which gravitates like the
ordinary baryonic matter but does not have other types of interaction,
is also a problem not fully resolved as yet.

### 1.2 Accelerated expansion of the Universe

The observations suggest that the Universe is expanding with an
accelerating rate at present. The accelerated expansion of the Universe
is very strange because gravity is known to be attractive. From the
Friedmann equations (equation ( 1.5 ) and ( 1.6 )), @xmath can be
expressed as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

As the scale factor @xmath is the scaling of distance between two object
in the Universe at cosmological scale, the second order time derivative
of @xmath is actually the acceleration. The knowledge of standard
cosmology suggests that the normal components of the energy budget of
the Universe (mainly the dark matter, the ordinary luminous matter, the
relativistic particles ( photon and neutrino )) respect the strong
energy condition that is @xmath . Thus it shows that the rate of
expansion should decrease (decelerated expansion) which is not
consistent with the present observations.

The cosmic acceleration is represented in a dimensionless way using the
deceleration parameter @xmath , defined as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

If the value of @xmath is negative, then the Universe is accelerating
and if @xmath is positive, the expansion is decelerating.

The Universe apparently has two phases of accelerated expansion. One is
the early inflation which is required to explain certain observational
phenomena. The second one is the late time acceleration which is the
present state of evolution of the Universe. In between this two phases
of accelerated expansion, there prevailed a phase of decelerated
expansion.

The cosmological inflation is the very rapid expansion of the Universe
just after the Big Bang. It started after @xmath sec. of the Big Bang
and ended around @xmath sec. to @xmath sec. Inflationary models have
been introduced by Alan Guth guthinflation for theoretical requirement
to explain the flatness problem and the horizon problem. The flatness
problem is related to the reason of observed flatness of the spatial
geometry of the Universe and the horizon problem is related to the
isotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation.

Late time acceleration is an observed phenomenon. It was first
discovered in late nineties by two supernova observing groups
independently (Supernova Search Team led by Riess riess1 and Supernova
Cosmology Project headed by Permutter perlmutter ). The prime
observation was of the magnitude redshift curve of type Ia supernovae
and it was highly consistent with the present accelerated expansion of
the Universe. Later on, many other observations have confirmed the late
time cosmic acceleration sn2 ; sn3 ; snsuzuki ; allenSW . Analysis of
observational data also suggest that the acceleration has started very
recently, at around redshif @xmath riess2 . It has emerged as the most
puzzling phenomenon of modern cosmology.

As already mentioned, the accelerated expansion of the Universe is
surprising because for all the well known components of the Universe,
even for the dark matter, gravity is attractive. But the accelerated
expansion invokes the possibility of repulsive gravity at cosmological
scale. There are different theoretical prescriptions in literature
attempting to answer this puzzle. The following section is devoted to
the discussions about those theoretical attempts to explain the
phenomenon of cosmic acceleration.

### 1.3 Theoretical attempts to explain the cosmic acceleration

As already mentioned, for the known components of the Universe it is not
possible to generate the accelerated expansion. There are different
theoretical prescriptions in the literature to explain the cosmic
acceleration. Though, still now, none of them has been universally
accepted as the one which is flawless, has a theoretical support and a
clue towards direct detection. The attempts are broadly classified into
two classes.

One is the dark energy model, where some exotic component, dubbed as
dark energy is introduced in the matter sector which has an effective
negative pressure, making @xmath and thus giving rise to a negative
value of the deceleration parameter ( @xmath ) (see equations ( 1.22 )
and ( 1.23 )). Dark energy approach is based on the assumption that the
GR is the appropriate theory of gravity.

The second way is to look for a suitable modification of GR to
accommodate the cosmic acceleration without introducing any exotic
component to the energy budget of the Universe.

Both of these approaches are applicable in the modelling of cosmic
inflation and late time acceleration. These two approaches have been
discussed in the following.

#### 1.3.1 Dark energy models

The dark energy models are the attempts to explain the cosmic
acceleration assuming GR to be the appropriate theory of gravity
shstatoAA ; paddyLCDM ; copelandsami ; ruiz ; durrermaartens . Equation
( 1.22 ) shows that an accelerated expansion can be generated if some
component of the energy sector has sufficient negative pressure. The
exotic component , dubbed as dark energy, generates the acceleration by
its characteristic negative pressure. It is essential to mention that
this pressure is not the fluid pressure which is caused by the motion of
particles. Rather, it is actually the contribution of the exotic
component to the energy momentum tensor. It is convenient to introduce
the density of different components in a dimensionless way by scaling
them with critical density ( @xmath ) which is defined as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

The dimensionless representations of the energy densities of different
components are,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath denotes the dust matter, @xmath denotes the radiation and
@xmath denotes the dark energy and @xmath is the contribution of the
spatial curvature. For a spatially flat model, @xmath . The @xmath are
called the density parameter of the corresponding component. Now the
Hubble parameter @xmath scaled by its present value @xmath can be
expressed in terms of the density parameters as (for a spatially flat
model),

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is clear from equation ( 1.22 ) that for accelerated expansion, the
effective or total equation of state parameter ( @xmath ) should be less
than @xmath . The matter component present in the energy budget is
mainly in the form of dust which is pressureless, that is @xmath . So
the equation of state parameter for dust matter @xmath . Now the dark
energy equation of state parameter ( @xmath ) is defined as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

The limiting value of @xmath required for cosmic acceleration can be
estimated from the deceleration parameter @xmath (defined in equation (
1.23 )). Ignoring the radiation energy density as it has only a
negligible contribution compared to the other components at late time,
the deceleration parameter can be expressed as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

Hence for a negative value of @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

The recent cosmological observations suggests that the present value of
dark energy density parameter @xmath and thus the present value of the
dark energy equation of state parameter should be @xmath . It is
important to note that the dark energy has started dominating the
dynamics of the Universe at recent past sn2 ; snsuzuki ; sn3 ; allenSW ;
riess2 . Earlier it was mostly dominated by dust matter and radiation.
This invokes the cosmic coincidence problem, that is, why the dark
energy has started dominating the evolution so recently. The other issue
is the physical identity of dark energy. In the following, different
dark energy models are briefly discussed.

##### Cosmological constant (@xmath)

The simplest model of dark energy is the cosmological constant model.
Dark energy model with cosmological constant is called the @xmath CDM
(cosmological constant @xmath with pressureless cold dark matter). The
constant energy density associated to @xmath is,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

The dark energy equation of state parameter for cosmological constant
@xmath . The cosmological constant model is preferred by most of the
observations at a good level of accuracy. But there are certain issues
related to cosmological constant. The constant vacuum energy density is
the only possible candidate for the cosmological constant. But it
suffers from the humongous discrepancy between the observationally
estimated value ( @xmath ) and the theoretically calculated value (
@xmath ) of the energy density. The ratio is @xmath . This is the fine
tuning problem of cosmological constant model. Different aspects of the
cosmological constant model have been discussed in great detail by
Carroll carrollLCDM and by Padmanabhan paddyLCDM .

##### Constant dark energy equation of state model (@xmath)

A constant dark energy equation of state parameter, with a value other
than @xmath , is also a relevant option for phenomenological study of
dark energy. It is the @xmath CDM model where @xmath , but not
necessarily equal to @xmath . It is a phenomenological approach to
investigate whether observational evidence of any deviation from @xmath
CDM model.

Though this phenomenological model ( @xmath CDM) seems to be very
similar to the @xmath CDM model, there are certain differences. It
allows the deviation of the value of @xmath from @xmath . The energy
density ( @xmath ) does not remain constant if @xmath . So, this
phenomenological model allows the evolution of the dark energy density
though @xmath remains constant.

##### Quintessence scalar field model

Quintessence scalar field model is the most popular one among the
different models of time evolving dark energy. The idea is to introduce
a homogeneous time dependent scalar field @xmath , minimally coupled to
the matter field and the nature of the field is characterized by a
potential @xmath associated to the scalar field.

The relevant action of a scaler field is written as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

The energy momentum tensor of the scalar field is defined as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

Thus for FRW space time, the component of the energy momentum tensor of
the quintessence scalar field ( @xmath ) are obtained as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore the expression of the dark energy equation of state parameter
( @xmath ) for a quintessence scalar field is give by,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is also straightforward from the expressions of @xmath and @xmath ,
that,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

This indicates that, for @xmath , @xmath . Now the quintessence
potential @xmath can be expressed as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

Equation ( 1.37 ) reveals that dark energy equation of state parameter (
@xmath ) for a quintessence model is time evolving.

Depending upon the nature of quintessence potential, quintessence models
are classified in three different classes.

@xmath If @xmath , then @xmath and the energy density varies as @xmath
which is equivalent to the stiff matter. This does not contribute like a
dark energy.

@xmath If @xmath , then @xmath and the energy density @xmath which is
equivalent to the cosmological constant.

@xmath For the intermediate scenario @xmath , the energy density @xmath
. The quintessence field generates cosmic acceleration for @xmath
copelandsami .

The idea of quintessence scalar field was first introduced in the
context of inflation by Ratra and Peeble ratrapeeble and by Wetterich
wettequint . There are ample amount of work in the literature in the
context of late time cosmic acceleration with different type of
quintessence potential. @xmath (where @xmath is a constant) type of
potential was first introduced in the context of dark energy. An
exponential potential can generate a power law expansion that is @xmath
( @xmath is a positive constant). But the exponential potential can not
explain the transition from decelerated to accelerated phase of
expansion. A double exponential potential can successfully generate the
present acceleration and the decelerated expansion phase that prevailed
in the recent past sensethi .
The quintessence scalar models with some fine-tuning can address the
problem of cosmic coincidence. Observations suggested that at present
the energy density of the scalar field ( @xmath ) and matter energy
density ( @xmath ) are comparable in order of magnitude. As these two
energy densities decay at different rates, it requires a fine tuning the
initial conditions to make them comparable at present time . The idea is
to introduce the quintessence potential in such a way that the energy
density ( @xmath ) behaves in a very similar way as the dark matter
density for a wide range of initial conditions. Actually the idea is
that the dark energy density will follow the evolution which is very
similar to the evolution of the matter density and at recent era, the
dark energy would dominate the dynamics. This is known as the tracking
behaviour of the quintessence dark energy. The idea of tracking
quintessence was first introduced by Zlatev, Wang and Steinhardt
trackquint . Some important investigation regarding the tracking scalar
field can be found in reference trackquint2 . Sahlen, Liddle and
Parkinson have reconstructed quintessence potential and checked the
viability of tracking behaviour shalenLidtrac . On the other hand, the
thawing scalar field models behave in the opposite way. The dark energy
equation of state parameter ( @xmath ) for a thawing model is close to
@xmath at earlier epoch and it increases with time. This is opposite to
the scenario of the tracking quintessence where @xmath decreases with
time. The behaviour of the dark energy equation of state depends upon
the relative shape of the quintessence potential. Comprehensive
discussion of thawing models of dark energy can be found in references
scherrersen ; thawingquint . Observational constraints on tracking and
thawing models are discussed by Chiba, Felice and Tsujikawa chibafetsu .
Comperative study of thawing and freezing models of dark energy has been
presented by Pantazis, Nesseris and Perivolaropoulos pantazisnessper .
Stability analysis of tracking quintessence has been discussed by Roy
and Banerjee roybantrckquin . Carvalho et al. showed that in a scalar
field dominated cosmology, it is possible to have a transient
accelerating expansion carvalholima .

##### K-essence model

This is a scalar field model where the kinetic part has the dominating
contribution in the energy density. This is the basic difference between
K-essence model and quintessence model where the quintessence potential
take the leading role in the contribution to the dark energy density.
The idea of accelerated expansion driven by the kinetic part of the
scalar field was first introduced in the context of inflation armengarr
. In the context of late time acceleration, it was introduced by Chiba
et al. chibaT and further generalization was done by Armendariz-Picon et
al. armenda

The action for the K-essence models is written as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the kinetic energy (KE) and the Lagrangian density
@xmath is in the form of pressure density. For a KE dominated scalar
field, the Lagrangian density @xmath for @xmath . A series expansion of
@xmath around @xmath is given as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the higher order terms of @xmath can be neglected for @xmath . The
scalar field now can be redefined as @xmath , and the Lagrangian density

@xmath ,

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . In a flat homogeneous and isotropic
Universe, the pressure ( @xmath ) and energy density ( @xmath ) of the
scalar field for this model is written as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

Thus the dark energy equation of state parameter is obtained as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

For accelerated expansion, @xmath , that means @xmath . For @xmath ,
@xmath that means this model can recover the cosmological constant model
for a particular condition.

For a viable cosmological model, @xmath is to be fine tuned to be of the
order of the energy density of the Universe. General discussions on the
K-essence model are given in kessencegen .

##### Tachyon field model

The idea of tachyon field model is inspired from the string theory. A
tachyon has a negative squared mass and the speed is greater than the
speed of light. It is produced at the time of decay of D-brane dbrane
and has an equation of state parameter that varies between @xmath to
@xmath and thus it can be chosen as a viable candidate of dark energy
tachdark . The tachyonic dark energy models that can successfully
generate late time acceleration, are discussed in reference tachmodel .

The state of tachyon field rests at the maxima of the associated
potential and with a small perturbation, it rolls down to the real mass.
The relevant action for a tachyon field is given as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the tachyonnic potential. In FRW space time, the energy
density @xmath and the pressure @xmath of the tachyon are written as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

Thus the dark energy equation of state parameter, @xmath , and for
accelerated expansion, @xmath . It can also be shown that the saclar
field energy density @xmath , where @xmath .

##### Phantom field model

In the context of dark energy, the phantom field was first discussed by
Caldwell caldwellphantom . The basic difference of phantom field from
the quintessence field is that the phantom field has negative kinetic
energy. The relevant action of the phantom field is written as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . The energy density ( @xmath ) and the pressure ( @xmath )
of the phantom field yield to be,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

The equation of state parameter of dark energy for phantom field,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

and for @xmath , @xmath . It leads to a very rapid expansion of the
Universe up to infinite extent within a finite time. This scenario is
called the Big Rip where both the volume and the expansion rate blow up
to infinity. A phantom field potential with a maxima can avoid the Big
Rip. For instance, @xmath , where @xmath is a constant, type of
potential can avoid the Big Rip. The field rests at the maxima after a
damped oscillation and thus the equation of state parameter @xmath as
@xmath . Thus it can restore the scenario of cosmological constant.

##### Chaplygin Gas model

Chaplygin gas was introduced in the context of cosmic acceleration by
Kamenshchik, Moschella and Pasquir kamenshchikchap . The idea of
Chaplygin gas is based on a special type of equation of state, @xmath ,
where @xmath is a positive constant. A generalization of Chaplygin gas
model has been discussed by Bento, Bertolami and Sen gcgbento , where
the equation of state is presented in a generalised form as, @xmath ,
(where @xmath ). From the continuity equation, the energy density can be
written as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the integration constant. For @xmath , the asymptotic
behaviour shows interesting results. When the scale factor @xmath is
small, @xmath , that means it behaves like a pressureless dust matter.
When @xmath , @xmath , so it resembles the cosmological constant. Thus
the generalised Chaplygin gas model is an attempt towards the
unification of dark energy and dark matter. Though the Chaplygin gas
models have been ruled out by the CMB temperature anisotropy data
amechap ; bentochap2 , the generalised Chaplygin gas models are allowed
within a narrow domain of the parameter, @xmath amechap .

#### 1.3.2 Modified gravity models

The other way to look for the plausible explanation of the phenomenon of
cosmic acceleration is the modification of GR. There are various way of
modification of the theory of gravity. Different @xmath gravity models
frmodels , scalar tensor theory scalten , higher dimensional gravity
theories highgrav etc. belong to the class of modified gravity theory.
Though modified gravity models are nice theoretical attempts and
adequately account for the cosmic acceleration, these models are
normally not very suitable to explain the local astronomical
observations. Some of the modified gravity theories are discussed in the
following.

##### @xmath gravity

The simplest modification of GR is the @xmath gravity where the
modification is done in the space time action by replacing the Ricci
scalar @xmath with an analytic function @xmath . Thus the @xmath gravity
action is given as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the matter Lagrangian. The field equations are also
modified as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the energy momentum tensor of the matter distribution.
For @xmath , the theory reduces to GR.

Depending on the form of @xmath , these models can generate the scenario
of early inflation or late time acceleration. For instance, @xmath type
of models generate cosmic inflation and @xmath , with @xmath type of
models are viable in case of late time acceleration. The @xmath gravity
in the context of inflation has been discussed by Satrobinsky starinffR
, Kerner kernerinffR and by Duruisseau and Kerner durkerinffR . As the
curvature @xmath decreases with time, inverse power of @xmath in the
expression of @xmath can have significant contribution in generating the
late time acceleration. In the context of late time cosmic acceleration,
@xmath gravity has been invoked by Capozziello et al capofR , Nojiri and
Odintsov nojodfR , Carroll et al. carrollfR , Das, Banerjee and Dadhich
dasbandfR ; @xmath type model has been emphasized by Carroll et al.
carrollfR and by Vollick vollickfR . An exponential @xmath model has
been investigated by Das, Banerjee and Dadhich dasbandfR . Some more
discussions on cosmological dynamics of @xmath gravity models are in
reference frdis . Amendola et al. frviableaman have discussed the
viability conditions of different @xmath gravity models; @xmath type of
models suffer from the problem of singularity at @xmath . An exponential
@xmath model can resolve this singularity problem, but it conflicts the
viability conditions discussed in frviableaman . Reconstruction of
@xmath model from observational data has been discussed by Felice,
Mukherjee and Wang frrecon . The recent results of observational test of
@xmath gravity have been discussed by Capozziello and Salzano capozz .

##### Scalar tensor theories

The basic idea of a scalar tensor theory is the nonminimal coupling
between the scalar field and the geometry. The simplest approach in this
direction is the Brans-Dicke theory bransdikke , where the scalar field
is coupled to the Ricci scalar ( @xmath ) and thus the Lagrangian is
given as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the Brans-Dicke parameter. This is a varying @xmath
theory. In the weak field limit, the Brans-Dicke theory resembles the
GR. But it is different from GR in non linear regime nbssbrans . The
generalised Brans-Dicke theory behaves as a coupled quintessence in
conformal frame bransconf . It has been shown by Banerjee and Pavon
banpav that the cosmic acceleration be generated in Brans-Dicke theory
without introducing any exotic component in the matter sector. But it
can hardly explain the smooth transition from decelerated to accelerated
phase of expansion. It also requires a low @xmath in cosmological
scenario, but local astronomy demands high @xmath .

### 1.4 Cosmological observations and the observational data sets

Cosmology today is a subject based on observations. The basic endeavour
is to model different observational phenomena. The observations are
mainly of the electromagnetic wave of different wavelength. Earlier, the
observations were limited within the optical wavelength. But at present,
the astronomical observations are going in the wavelength regime
starting from microwave to gamma ray.

In the following, some of the observations which are important in the
context of cosmological modelling, mainly in the context of late time
cosmic acceleration, have been discussed. These are the observations of
type Ia supernova, observational measurement of Hubble parameter, the
baryon acoustic oscillation and the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
radiation.

#### 1.4.1 Observation of type Ia Supernova

In the context of late time cosmic acceleration, the pioneering
observation is the type Ia supernova. As already mentioned, the
phenomenon of cosmic acceleration was first discovered during the
observation of type Ia supernova by two different groups riess1 ;
perlmutter . The type Ia supernova is a standard candle for astronomical
observation. A standard candle is defined as a class of distinguishable
objects of known intrinsic brightness and it can be distinguished in a
wide range of distance. As the Universe expands, the distance between
the object and the observer increases and the wavelength of the radiated
photons also increases. Thus the radiated photon get redshifted. The
observed brightness of the objects and the redshift of the observed
photons provide a measurement of the expansion of the Universe.

Distance measurements of supernova are presented at different redshift (
@xmath ) in the form of distance modulus ( @xmath ) which is actually
the difference between the apparent magnitude ( @xmath ) and the
absolute magnitude ( @xmath ) of the B-band (wavelength band of blue
line) of the observed spectrum of the supernova. The apparent magnitude
is related to the observed brightness or the observed photon flux (
@xmath ). If two objects in the sky have apparent magnitude @xmath and
@xmath with observed photon flux @xmath and @xmath respectively, then,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

araichou . Now if the two objects have same luminosity @xmath , then one
can write,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are the luminosity distance of the respective
objects (luminosity distance is defined in equation ( 1.16 )). It is
imperative to note that the value of apparent magnitude ( @xmath )
decreases if the observed brightness increases. The absolute magnitude (
@xmath ) is defined as the apparent magnitude of the object if it is at
10 parsecs (pc) away from the observer. In case of a particular standard
candle, the absolute magnitude is same for all observations. The
distance of the object is related to the difference of apparent and
absolute magnitude as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the distance is scaled by the unit parsec (pc). Finally the
distance modulus for the B-band of the observed supernova ( @xmath ) is
written as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the luminosity distance of the object in the unit of
Mpc. This @xmath can be expressed in terms of the present values of the
Hubble parameter ( @xmath ) and the deceleration parameter ( @xmath )
as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

akrthcos . The higher order terms can be neglected for small values of
@xmath . As the observed luminosity distance for nearby supernova is
higher than the expected value, it can be concluded that the value of
@xmath is negative. That means the present Universe is going through a
phase of accelerated expansion.

In the context of statistical analysis of different cosmological models
discussed in the following chapters, the distance modulus data of 580
supernovae of Union 2.1 compilation snsuzuki or the recent data of 740
supernovae sample of joint lightcurve analysis (jla) of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey II (SDSS II) and Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS)
snbetoule have been utilized.

#### 1.4.2 Observational measurement of Hubble parameter

The Hubble parameter, which is the fractional rate of the expansion, is
defined as, @xmath , where @xmath is the scale factor. The Hubble
parameter can be estimated at different redshift ( @xmath ), from
observation. In the statistical analysis, discussed in the following
chapters, the measurement of Hubble parameter by different groups have
been used.

The estimation of the value of @xmath can be obtained from the
measurement of differential of redshift @xmath with respect to cosmic
time @xmath as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

The differential age of galaxies have been used as an estimator of
@xmath by Simon et al. simonohd . Measurement of cosmic expansion
history using red-enveloped galaxies was done by Stern et al. sternohd
and by Chuang and Wang chuangohd . Measurement of expansion history from
WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey has been discussed by Blake et al. blakeohd .
Measurement of Hubble parameter at low redshift using the differential
age method with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data have been presented by
Zhang et al. zhangohd . Compilation of observational Hubble parameter
measurement has been presented by Moresco et al. morescoohd . Finally,
the measurement of Hubble parameter at @xmath by Busca et al. buscaohd
or the improved estimation at @xmath by Delubac et al. delubacohd has
also been incorporated in the data set, used in the present analysis.
Table 1.1 presents the @xmath measurements which have been used in the
present analysis. The measurement of @xmath from Planck combining
Planck+WP+highL+BAO data (Planck temperature data (Planck), WMAP
polarization data (WP), other high resolution CMB observation data
(highL) and baryon acoustic oscillation data (BAO)) planck2013 has also
been used in the analysis.

#### 1.4.3 Baryon acoustic oscillation

Baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) is the oscillation of the tightly
coupled photon-baryon plasma before the recombination. The idea of
statistical standard ruler with baryon acoustic oscillation is based on
the fact that the clustering of galaxies may have a preferred scale.
This preferred scale of galaxy clustering can be used to constrain the
angular diameter distance. The phenomenon behind this distance
correlation of galaxy clustering is actually the baryon acoustic
oscillation.

Before recombination , the formation of neutral hydrogen atom and the
decoupling of photon from baryon matter, the mixture of baryons and
photons was in the form of a hot plasma due to tight coupling between
photons and baryons via Thomson scattering. The radiation pressure and
the gravitational attraction acted as two competing forces and thus set
up oscillations in the plasma. A single spherical over-density in the
tightly coupled photon-baryon plasma would propagate with a speed @xmath
, where @xmath is the baryon density and @xmath is the photon density
eisensbao .

At recombination, the photon decoupled from the baryon and propagated
freely, forming the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The baryon became
neutral at recombination and the spherical shells formed due to the
baryon oscillation remain imprinted on the distribution of the baryonic
matter in the Universe. The comoving sound horizon ( @xmath ) at a given
redshift ( @xmath ) is the distance travelled by the acoustic wave in
the time interval starting from the beginning of matter formation to
that given redshift @xmath . The acoustic scale is the distance scale at
which the galaxy clusters are correlated.

In the statistical analysis, discussed in the following chapters, the
BAO data along with the measurement of acoustic scale ( @xmath ) and the
sound horizon ( @xmath ) at photon-electron decoupling ( @xmath ) and at
photon drag epoch ( @xmath ) have been used. The comoving sound horizon
is defined as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the present value of the baryon density parameter and
@xmath is the present value of the photon density parameter. The
acoustic scale at photon decoupling is defined as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the comoving angular diameter distance at decoupling.
Another important definition is of dilation scale ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.62)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is actually a geometric mean of two transverse and one radial
directions measurements of the distance for BAO. According to the Planck
results, the redshift of photon decoupling is @xmath and the redshift of
photon drag epoch is @xmath planck2013 . The Planck measurement of the
acoustic scale at photon decoupling @xmath and ratio of comoving sound
horizon at drag epoch ( @xmath ) and at decoupling ( @xmath ) is @xmath
planck2013 ; wangwangcmb .

The BAO data are normally given in the from @xmath and it can be scaled
to @xmath for convenience in the context of studying the dark energy
models. Detail discussion regarding the statistical analysis of
cosmological models using BAO data is presented by Giostri et al.
giostribao . Different measurement of BAO data have been utilized in the
present context. This are from the 6dF Galaxy Survey at @xmath
beutlerbao , measurements of WiggleZ team at @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
blakebaowiggleZ , measurements of BAO from Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) at @xmath and @xmath percilavSDSSbao and the Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) at @xmath (BOSS LOWZ) and at @xmath (BOSS
CMASS) bossandersonbao . It is worth mentioning that all the data points
referred to here have not been incorporated in a single analysis so as
to avoid the effects of complicated correlations between the
measurements. Different combinations of the BAO data points have been
utilized in different analysis discussed in the following chapters.

#### 1.4.4 Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation

The discovery of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation has
opened a new window in observational cosmology penziascmb . Cosmic
microwave background (CMB) radiation is the relic photon that decoupled
from the baryon at recombination. The temperature of the Universe at
recombination was @xmath K. The radiated photon temperature decreases
due to redshift and the observed CMB temperature at present epoch is
@xmath K fixsencmb . The redshift of recombination, when the photons
decoupled from the baryons, is @xmath planck2013 .

Though the distribution of temperature of the CMB photon is highly
isotropic, fluctuation of the order of @xmath has been observed by
Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) cobe , Differential Microwave
Radiometer (DMR) cobedmr and later by Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe (WMAP) komatsuWMAP and Planck satellite planck2013 ; planck2015 .
The temperature fluctuation is presented as @xmath , where @xmath is the
direction vector, @xmath is the average CMB temperature and @xmath . For
a Gaussian fluctuation, the multipole moments of the temperature
fluctuation field is written as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.63)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the complex conjugate of the spherical harmonics. The
power spectrum is written as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

The multipole moment @xmath is related to the angular separation @xmath
as @xmath ; thus large multipole moment corresponds to small angular
separation. Finally the power spectrum is expressed as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.65)
  -- -------- -- --------

A comprehensive review on the CMB temperature and polarization spectrum
is presented by Hu and Dodelson hudodcmb .

In the statistical analysis of different cosmological models, discussed
in the following chapters, the CMB shift parameter data has been used.
The CMB shift parameter is related to the position of the first acoustic
peak in the power spectrum of CMB temperature anisotropy. The CMB shift
parameter is defined as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the present value of the matter density parameter,
@xmath is the present value of the Hubble parameter and @xmath is the
redshift of photon decoupling. The value of the CMB shift parameter is
estimated from the CMB data with some fiducial assumption about the
cosmological model. In the present analysis, the estimation of the CMB
shift parameter by Wang and Wang wangwangcmb from the combined analysis
with Planck+lensing+WP data has been utilized, where the estimated value
of the shift parameter is @xmath at 1 @xmath confidence level.

### 1.5 Statistical analysis of cosmological models

Now that a large amount of observational data are available, the
relevance of a cosmological model can be tested against the available
data. These tests crucially depend on the statistical analysis of the
observed data and estimation of the values of the relevant cosmological
parameters. In the context of late time acceleration, the relevant
physical parameters are the dark energy equation of state parameter (
@xmath ), the present value of the matter density parameter ( @xmath ),
the dark energy density parameter ( @xmath ) etc. There are also other
parameters which are introduced through the corresponding models and
they are related to some physical quantity. The estimation of the
parameters and the statistical comparison of different models have been
discussed in brief in the following section.

#### 1.5.1 The @xmath and the likelihood

To estimate the parameter values of cosmological models from the
observational data, a @xmath -statistics has been adopted. The @xmath is
defined as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the observationally estimated value of the observable at
redshift @xmath , @xmath is the form of the observable as given by the
model as a function of the set of model parameters @xmath and @xmath is
the uncertainty associated to the measurement at @xmath .

The @xmath for the observational Hubble parameter data (OHD) is written
as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.68)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the observed value of the Hubble parameter, @xmath is
theoretical one and @xmath is the uncertainty associated to the @xmath
measurement. The @xmath is a function of the set of model parameters
@xmath .

The @xmath of the supernova distance modulus data is defined in a
slightly complicated way so as to marginalize the nuisance parameter
@xmath and to incorporate the systematics of the distance modulus
measurements. The method discussed by Farooq, Mania and Ratra
farooqmaniarartasne has been adopted. The @xmath has been defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.69)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.70)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.71)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.72)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the @xmath is the covariance matrix of the data. Here the @xmath is
a constant which does not depend upon the parameters and hence has been
ignored.

The relevant @xmath for baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, namely
@xmath , is defined as:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.73)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath in the form of a column matrix and @xmath is the inverse of
the covariance matrix.

The @xmath is defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.74)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the value of CMB shift parameter estimated from
observational data, @xmath is from the theoretical model and @xmath is
the corresponding uncertainty.

For statistical analysis with combinations of different data sets, the
@xmath associated to different data sets are added up to define the
combined @xmath as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.75)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath denotes the data sets taken into account for that
particular combination.

The likelihood function is defined as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.76)
  -- -------- -- --------

The likelihood is also a function of the model parameters. In Bayes’
theorem, the posterior probability distribution of parameter ( @xmath )
is expressed as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.77)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the proposition representing the prior information,
@xmath represents the data; @xmath is the probability of obtaining the
data if parameter @xmath is given according to @xmath ; @xmath is the
likelihood; @xmath is the prior probability; @xmath is called the global
likelihood which is actually the normalization factor @xmath ensuring
@xmath . Thus the @xmath and the likelihood are connected to the
Bayesian approach and the prime endeavour of statistical analysis of a
cosmological model is to figure out the posterior probability
distribution of model parameters. Comprehensive discussions on
statistical analysis with the Bayesian approach is presented by Gergory
gregorybayesian and by Hobson et al. hobsonbayesian .

#### 1.5.2 Estimation of the parameter values and propagation of error

##### Maximum likelihood analysis

To obtain the best fit values of the model parameters, the maximum
likelihood analysis has been adopted. It is clear from the definition of
likelihood that the minimum value of the corresponding @xmath would
maximise the value of the likelihood function. Thus the @xmath
minimization is equivalent to the maximum likelihood analysis. Analysis
for different cosmological models, discussed in the following chapters,
have been done numerically using the basic grid searching of likelihood
where the range of the parameters are divided into grids and all
possible combinations are evaluated to obtain the maximum likelihood and
the corresponding best fit values of the parameters @xmath . Numerical
analysis have been done in Mathematica. The code to obtain the contour
plots for @xmath CDM model with OHD data has been shown in figure 1.1
and some part of the code for SNe data are sohwn in the figure 1.2 . The
best fit values of the parameters are obtained by minimizing the
corresponding @xmath . The confidence contours are obtained by adding
the @xmath with the @xmath where the value of @xmath at the boundary of
the the contour on the parameter space is @xmath . The value of @xmath
for different confidence level on 2 dimensional parameter space are,
@xmath (at 1 @xmath ), @xmath (at 2 @xmath ) and @xmath (at 3 @xmath ).

To estimate the error associated to the best fit values of the model
parameters obtained from the maximum likelihood analysis, it is required
to calculate the parameter covariance matrix from the @xmath . The
parameter covariance matrix is defined as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.78)
  -- -------- -- --------

The diagonal terms of the matrix give the variance ( @xmath ) of the
corresponding parameter and the off-diagonal terms are the covariance (
@xmath ) of the two parameters associated to that term. In this way the
parameter values are estimated from the observational data.

##### Propagation of errors

Sometimes it is required to figure out the evolution of different
quantities which are functions of the model parameters. As there are
uncertainties associated with the parameter values, the quantities which
are the functions of of the model parameters, would also have errors
along with the best fit curves. The Taylor series expansion of @xmath
around the best fit value is written as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.79)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a function of the model parameters. If the likelihood of
the parameters are Gaussian function, then the higher order terms can be
ignored as for a Gaussian distribution, the probability falls rapidly
for higher deviation from the best fit point. Thus only very small
values of @xmath are probabilistically significant. The variance of
@xmath thus looks like,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.80)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 1.5.3 Bayesian evidence and model selection

Statistical comparison of different models can be done with different
model selection criteria like the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).

The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) aic is defined as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.81)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the maximum likelihood and @xmath is the number of free
parameter in the model.

The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) bic , which is actually based
on the Bayesian evidence, is defined as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.82)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the number of data point used in the analysis.

The definitions show that the AIC and BIC are quite close to each other.
For comparison between two models, the difference between the value of
AIC of the two models, i.e. @xmath , and the difference between the
value of BIC of the two models, i.e. @xmath are important. If the two
models have same number of free parameters and same number of data
points used in the statistical analysis, then the @xmath and @xmath are
same. If @xmath (or @xmath ) @xmath , then the models are in close
proximity of each other according to the statistical model selection. If
@xmath , the models are not very close according to preference. If
@xmath then the models are significantly different.

In a Bayesian analysis, calculation of Bayesian evidence is a more
powerful approach for the model selection as it more general. The
information criteria are approximated from Bayesian evidence. The
Bayesian evidence is defined as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.83)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are the model parameters. The ratio of Bayesian evidence of
two models is called the Bayes’ factor kassbayesfac . If the Bayes’
factor is greater than @xmath , then the evidence is said to be strong
regarding the model selection. The model with higher value of the
evidence is more preferred.

### 1.6 Reconstruction of cosmological models and the present work

As there is no theoretically compelling reason to pick any model for the
late time dynamics of the universe from other branches of physics, such
as particle physics theory, the present trend is to find the some viable
model right from the observations. The basic idea is to choose a viable
evolution scenario, choosing @xmath or @xmath , and using that finding
out the cosmological parameters like the dark energy equation of state
parameter, the dark energy density parameter, the quintessence scalar
field or the potential etc. using statistical techniques with the
observational data. This kind of reverse engineering is called the
reconstruction . Pioneering work in this direction was by Ellis and
Madsen ellismadsenreconst , where the scalar field potential was found
from a given evolution scenario, i.e., @xmath , through Einstein’s
equations. Starobinsky showed that the potential associated to the
scalar field can be reconstructed using the density perturbation
staroreconst . The data of distance measurement of supernova has been
utilized by Huterer and Turner huterreconst and by Saini et al.
sainireconst .

Reconstruction of dark energy that drives the cosmic acceleration,
normally involves the finding out the dark energy equation of state
parameter @xmath as a function of redshift, i.e. @xmath huterreconst ;
sainireconst ; vsahniaasrarore . Reconstruction is mainly done in two
different ways. One is called parametric reconstruction where a suitable
ansatz for @xmath is chosen and the value of the model parameters are
estimated from the observational data reparam ; cplparam ; scherrersen .
Parametric reconstruction with other cosmological quantities like
deceleration parameter, total equation of state parameter are also there
in literature GongWang2007 . The other way of reconstruction is a non
parametric approach which is an attempt to reconstruct the evolution of
@xmath directly from observational data without any prior assumption
about the functional form nonparreconst .

Cosmological quantities, that only consist of the scale factor and its
time derivatives, are called the kinematical parameters. Kinematic
approach in the study of cosmic evolution is independent of any
particular gravity theory. The Hubble parameter, deceleration parameter,
the jerk parameter etc., belong to the set of kinematic quantities.
Reconstruction of different kinematical quantities using the
observational data depicts the nature of cosmic evolution without any
apriori assumption regarding the dark energy. A kinematic approach was
discussed by Riess et al. riess2 , where a linear parametrization of
deceleration parameter @xmath has been used to estimate the value of
redshift at which the transition from decelerated to accelerated
expansion happened. The cosmological jerk parameter, which is a
dimensionless representation of the third-order time derivative of the
scale factor, has been used as a diagnostic of dark energy models by
Sahni et al. sahnistatefinder and Alam et al. alamstatefinder . The jerk
parameter and a combination of jerk and deceleration parameter together
have been identified as the statefinder parameter in these two
investigations. Reconstruction of dark energy equation of state through
the parametrization of cosmological jerk has been discussed by Luongo
luongojerk . Kinematic approach to the modelling of accelerating
Universe has been discussed by Rapetti et al. rapettijerk , where a
constant jerk parameter model has been invoked. Evolving jerk parameter
models has been investigated by Zhai et al. zhaijerk .

The present work, which has been discussed in the following chapters, is
devoted to the reconstruction of the dark energy models using diverse
observational data sets. The parametric approach has been adopted for
the reconstruction of cosmological models. The reconstruction of
kinematic quantities and the possibility of interaction between dark
energy and dark matter have also been emphasised.

In the second chapter, a parametric reconstruction of the dark energy
equation of state for a quintessence scalar field model has been
discussed. A new parametric form of the dark energy equation of state
parameter ( @xmath ) has been introduced. It is written as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.84)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the model parameter. Effectively there are two
parameters, one is the @xmath and the other one is the matter density
parameter @xmath . The values of the model parameter have been estimated
by @xmath minimization technique using different combinations of the
data sets, namely the OHD, SNe, BAO and CMB shift parameter data. The
values obtained in the combined analysis with these four data sets are,
@xmath and @xmath at 1 @xmath error bar. The best fit value of @xmath is
negative and thus the model shows a preference towards the phantom
nature of dark energy. The corresponding scalar field potential has also
been studied. The potential comes out to be a double exponential
potential and it is a generalization of the potential discussed by Sen
and Sethi sensethi .

In the third chapter, a parametric reconstruction of the effective or
total equation of state parameter ( @xmath ) has been discussed. The
form of @xmath is chosen as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.85)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the expression of the Hubble parameter has been obtained for this
model as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.86)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the present value of the Hubble parameter. The model
contains two parameter @xmath and @xmath . The series expansion of
@xmath will show that there is a term with @xmath which represents the
matter density and the corresponding coefficient @xmath is the matter
density parameter. The reconstructed mode mimics the @xmath CDM model
for @xmath , thus the value of the model parameter @xmath , obtained in
the statistical analysis, would indicate the deviation of the model form
@xmath CDM. The values of the model parameters, obtained in the
statistical analysis with SNe, OHD, BAO and CMB shift parameter data,
are @xmath and @xmath at 1 @xmath confidence level. A comparative study
between the reconstructed model and the @xmath CDM dark energy model has
been done by representing both the models on ( @xmath ) parameter space
where @xmath is the present value of the deceleration parameter and
@xmath is the present value of cosmological jerk parameter. It has been
shown that the reconstructed model ensures tighter constraints on the
kinematic quantities like the deceleration parameter and the jerk
parameter.

The fourth chapter is devoted to the reconstruction of cosmological jerk
parameter @xmath . This is a kinematic approach which is independent of
any prior assumption about the gravity theory. The jerk parameter is
defined as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.87)
  -- -------- -- --------

where a prime denotes the derivative with respect to the redshift @xmath
. The formalism discussed by Zhai et al zhaijerk has been adopted in the
present work. The form of jerk parameter is assumed as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.88)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a constant and @xmath is an analytic function of @xmath
. Four ansatz for @xmath have been chosen in the present work. The four
ansatz chosen are given below,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.89)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.90)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.91)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.92)
  -- -------- -- --------

The models effectively have two parameters. One is coming in the
expression of the Hubble parameter as integration constant ( @xmath ),
and other one is the @xmath . The parameter @xmath is equivalent to the
matter density parameter @xmath . The value of the model parameters
obtained from the combined analysis using OHD, SNe, BAO and CMBShift
data are, Model I. @xmath , @xmath ; Model II. @xmath , @xmath ; Model
III. @xmath , @xmath ; Model IV. @xmath , @xmath . The nature of
evolution of deceleration parameter, jerk parameter and dark energy
equation of state parameter have also been studied. A Bayesian analysis,
mainly the calculation of the Bayesian evidence shows that the models
are at close proximity of each other according to statistical preference
and it can only be concluded that Model IV is marginally preferred to
the other models.

The fifth chapter also about a kinematic approach to the reconstruction
of dark energy. The possibility of the interaction between dark energy
and dark matter has been investigated in this reconstruction. The
reconstruction has been done with an assumption of a slowly varying jerk
parameter which is effectively a constant in the low redshift regime.
The expression of Hubble parameter obtained in this case is,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.93)
  -- -------- -- --------

The model has two parameters @xmath and constant jerk parameter @xmath .
The parameter @xmath which comes as an integration constant, is actually
the matter density parameter. For @xmath , the present model mimics the
@xmath CDM. Any deviation of the the value of parameter @xmath from
@xmath does not allow the dark matter and the dark energy components to
have independent conservation. Thus it invokes the possibility of
interaction between dark matter and the dark energy. The total
conservation equation can be written into two parts,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.94)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.95)
  -- -------- -- --------

The interaction term @xmath can be represented in a dimensionless way
as, @xmath . The values of the model parameters, obtained in the
combined analysis with OHD, SNe and BAO are, @xmath and @xmath . The
interaction term has also been reconstructed and it shows that the
possibility of interaction is high in the past, but it is very low at
present. The value of parameter @xmath obtained from the statistical
analysis shows that the model remains at close proximity of @xmath CDM.
The dark energy equation of state parameter shows a slight inclination
towards the non-phantom nature.

In the sixth chapter, the interaction rate of dark energy and dark
matter has been reconstructed for holographic dark energy model. The
idea of holographic dark energy is based on fundamental thermodynamic
consideration, namely the holographic principle hooft ; susskind . It
relates a short distance cut-off (ultraviolet cut-off) to a long
distance cut-off (infrared (IR) cut-off). Finally the holographic dark
energy density is written as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.96)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a dimensionless constant, @xmath and @xmath is the
associated IR cut-off. In the present work, the Hubble horizon is taken
as the IR cut-off, i.e. @xmath . The interaction rate between dark
energy and dark matter has been reconstructed for two different
parameterization of the deceleration parameter, Model I. @xmath and
Model II. @xmath . The total conservation equation has been written into
two parts, similar to that in equation ( 1.94 ) and ( 1.95 ), and the
interaction rate is defined as @xmath . The interaction rate can be
expressed as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.97)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the effective or total equation of state parameter and
the @xmath is called the coincidence parameter . The evolution of the
interaction rate, the nature of dark energy equation of state parameter
have been studied. The cosmic coincidence problem in the context of
holographic dark energy has also been discussed. In a spatially flat
universe, holographic dark energy model with Hubble horizon as the IR
cut-off has a constant value of coincident parameter @xmath . The dark
energy equation of state parameter shows a phantom nature at present and
at high redshift it tends to zero, thus the dark energy component is
indistinguishable from the dark matter at high redshift.

Finally, chapter seven contains the concluding remark and relevant
discussions regarding the overall work presented in the thesis.

## Chapter 2 A reconstruction of dark energy equation of state

### 2.1 Introduction

To explain the cosmic acceleration, the exotic component introduced in
the energy budget of the Universe is called the dark energy. The attempt
towards finding a viable model using the observational data is the
reconstruction , which is actually the reverse way of building the
model. The idea is to assume a viable evolution scenario and then to
find the suitable matter distribution consistent with the evolution
scenario. The reconstruction of dark energy models mainly hovers around
finding the nature and evolution of the dark energy equation of state.
In the present chapter, a new parametric dark energy equation of state
has been discussed. A scaler field ( @xmath ) model, associated with the
reconstructed dark energy equation of state, has been picked up and the
nature and evolution of the scalar field potential ( @xmath ) has been
investigated. The reconstruction is based upon the parametrization of
the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath . In this chapter, a
new parametric dark energy equation of state parameter has been
proposed. Eventually the equation of state leads to a particular form of
the quintessence potential, @xmath , where @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath are constants. Statistical analysis of this model is carried out
using the type Ia supernova distance modulus data (SNe), observational
Hubble parameter data (OHD), Baryon Acoustic oscillation data (BAO) and
the CMB shift parameter data (CMBShift). This model also shows a slight
inclination towards the phantom behaviour across the limit @xmath .

### 2.2 Reconstruction of the scalar field potential from the equation
of state parameter

The field equations for a spatially flat FRW universe with cold dark
matter (given by a pressureless fluid) and a scalar field ( @xmath ) are

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the Hubble parameter given by @xmath , @xmath is the
matter energy density and @xmath and @xmath are the contributions of the
scalar field to the energy density and pressure sectors respectively.
The latter two are given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the scalar potential. An overhead dot indicates a
differentiation with respect to the cosmic time @xmath . The
pressureless cold dark matter satisfies its own conservation equation
which leads to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the redshift. The constant, @xmath , is the present
value of the dark matter density. With equations ( 2.1 ),( 2.2 ) and (
2.5 ), the wave equation for the scalar field,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

is a consequence of the Bianchi identity and does not lead to an
independent equation. From equations ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2 ), the equation
of state parameter @xmath can be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

One can replace the argument ‘ @xmath ’ by the redshift @xmath in this
equation. With the aid of the equation ( 2.5 ), the equation ( 2.7 )
would look like

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

As we have three unknown quantities @xmath , @xmath and @xmath against
only two equations, namely equation ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2 ) to solve for
them, we can choose an ansatz so as to close the system of equations. In
what follows, a one parameter equation of state, given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

is chosen where @xmath is a constant parameter. The reason for choosing
this kind of @xmath is that for high @xmath , i.e. at the early stage of
evolution, @xmath is almost zero so that it is hardly distinguishable
from the equation of state parameter of a pressureless fluid, but
gradually decreases to more and more negative values so as to yield an
increasing negative pressure. For @xmath , @xmath reduces to @xmath ,
i.e., that of a cosmological constant. For @xmath , the model leads to a
phantom behaviour i.e. @xmath . Normally a dark energy model is chosen
such that it remains subdued at an early stage, i.e., for high value of
@xmath and evolves to dominate over the dark matter only at the later
stage of evolution. The present choice is qualitatively different from
such models as at the early stage with @xmath approaching zero, the dark
energy is indistinguishable from the pressureless dark matter rather
than being subdued.

With equation ( 2.9 ), one can integrate equation ( 2.8 ) to obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the present value of Hubble parameter and @xmath is the
present matter density parameter defined as @xmath . From the expression
of Hubble parameter (equation 2.10 ), the model looks like the @xmath
CDM a bit in disguise. But this is not exactly the case as we can not
determine parameter @xmath in terms of @xmath from the flatness
constraint.

The deceleration parameter @xmath , defined as ( @xmath ), can be
written in terms of @xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

The nature of evolution of @xmath can be investigated utilizing the
values of the parameters @xmath and @xmath , constrained by observation.
Now from equation ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2 ), one can write (using the
expression for @xmath and @xmath )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

which can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

if @xmath is used as the argument instead of @xmath . This can be
integrated to yield (using equation ( 2.10 )) the result

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.14)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

An addition of the field equations ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2 ) will now yield

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this expression @xmath can be replaced by @xmath using equation (
2.14 ) to obtain the potential as a function of @xmath as,

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.16)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath .

### 2.3 Observational constraints on the parameters

The essential part of parametric reconstruction is the estimation of the
parameter values from the observational data. There are two parameters
in the model, the matter density parameter @xmath and the parameter
@xmath which is introduced through the expression of @xmath . Here the
observational Hubble parameter data (OHD), type Ia supernova distance
modulus data (SNe), baryon acoustic oscillation data (BAO) and the CMB
shift parameter (CMBShift) data have been used for the statistical
analysis.

The observational Hubble data set (OHD) is obtained from the measurement
by different groups. Hubble parameter is measured directly from cosmic
chromometres and differential age of galaxies in the redshift range
@xmath simonohd ; sternohd ; chuangohd ; blakeohd ; zhangohd ;
morescoohd . Measurement of Hubble parameter at @xmath buscaohd has also
been incorporated in the data set. The measurement of @xmath from Planck
planck2013 has also been utilized.

The distance modulus ( @xmath ) data set from type Ia supernova
observations is very widely used one for the analysis of dark energy
models. In the present work, the SNe data set of Union 2.1 compilation
snsuzuki has been utilized.

Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data (BAO) beutlerbao ; blakebaowiggleZ ;
percilavSDSSbao along with the measurement of comoving sound horizon at
photon decoupling epoch ( @xmath ) and at photon drag epoch ( @xmath )
and the estimation of the value of acoustic scale at decoupling obtained
from Planck results planck2013 ; wangwangcmb have been incorporated in
the statistical analysis.

Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, in the form of a distance prior,
namely the CMB shift parameter @xmath , estimated from Planck data in
wangwangcmb , has also been utilized here.

@xmath -minimization (which is equivalent to the maximum likelihood
analysis) technique has been adopted in the present work for the
statistical analysis. Detail discussion about the observational data
sets and the statistical techniques are presented in previous chapter
(section 1.4 and 1.5 ).

Figure 2.1 presents the confidence contours on 2D parameter space of the
model obtained for different combination of the data sets. It is
important to note that the CMB shift parameter data is common to all
combinations taken into account in the analysis. Actually the addition
of the shift parameter data leads to substantial improvement of the
constraints on the model parameters. Table 2.1 contains the best fit
values of the parameters @xmath and @xmath along with the allowed
variation in the 1 @xmath error bar. The best fit values are obtained by
the usual @xmath minimization technique. Figure 2.2 presents the
marginalised likelihood functions. The likelihood function plots are
well fitted to Gaussian distribution for both the parameters as
arguments.

Contour plots on 2D parameter space (figure 2.1 ), obtained from
different combinations of the data sets, shows that the parameters (
@xmath and @xmath ) have a positive correlation between them. The
likelihood plots (figure 2.2 ) show that the result obtained from the
analysis with OHD+SNe+CMBShift and OHD+SNe+BAO+CMBSHift are very close
to @xmath CDM model as the bets fit values of the model parameter @xmath
is very close to zero. The results obtained for OHD+CMBShift and
SNe+CMBShift have slightly higher deviation from @xmath CDM limit.
Though the @xmath CDM always remains within 1 @xmath confidence region
of the reconstructed model.

The plot of dark energy equation of state parameter ( @xmath ) (left
panel of figure 2.3 ) shows that it is almost constant in the low
redshift regime and has a slight inclination towards the phantom nature.
The associated uncertainty increases with increase in redshift. Right
panel of figure 2.3 shows the plot of deceleration parameter. The
corresponding scalar field potential shows a slowly varying nature
(figure 2.4 )

### 2.4 Discussion

This chapter presents a scalar field model of dark energy where a dark
energy equation of state parameter @xmath , which is chosen as a one
parameter function of @xmath , is reconstructed from the observational
data. Tighter constraints on the parameters can be obtained using proper
combination of the data sets (figure 2.1 ). The last row in table 2.1
shows the best fit values of the model parameter @xmath (which describes
the equation of state given by equation ( 2.9 )) and the matter density
parameter @xmath , obtained for various combination of SNe, OHD, BAO and
CMB shift parameter data. The values, when all the four data sets are
combined, are given as @xmath and @xmath in 1 @xmath confidence region.
The best fit value of @xmath is negative, but very close to zero. That
means the proposed model is very close to @xmath CDM with a tendency
towards favouring the phantom nature of dark energy (left panel of
figure 2.3 ). The present value of dark energy equation of state
parameter ( @xmath ) is constrained to be @xmath at 1 @xmath confidence
level by the present reconstruction.

It has already been mentioned that one characteristic feature of the
parametrization, discussed in the present chapter, is that the dark
energy equation of state parameter tends to zero at high redshift. Thus
the dark energy behaves like dust matter at high redshift causing an
extra dust like contribution but it is significant only at asymptotic
limit. In addition to that, high-redshift data, namely the CMB shift
parameter, constraints the value of the model parameter @xmath (in order
of magnitude). Thus the extra dust like contribution does not have any
significant effect on the cosmic structure formation.

The right panel of figure 2.3 shows that the deceleration parameter
@xmath starts positive for a higher @xmath , and attains negative value
near @xmath with a signature flip between @xmath and @xmath . This is
consistent with the recent analysis by Farooq and Ratra farooqratra .

The reconstructed quintessence potential is shown in the figure 2.4 .
The left panel, which depicts @xmath , clearly indicates that @xmath
remains almost flat. So one can say that the potential is a freezing
potential as opposed to a thawing one (see for example, the work of
Caldwell and Linder caldwelllinder and that of Scherrer and Sen
scherrersen ).

The potential is shown as a function of the scalar field ( @xmath ) in
the right panel of figure 2.4 and the analytic form is given in equation
( 2.16 ). A similar potential had already been discussed by Sen and
Sethi sensethi . The potential obtained in the present work in the form
@xmath where @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are constants, is a
generalization of the potential given by Sen and Sethi, where @xmath .
The requirement of @xmath would yield, from equation ( 2.16 ), the
condition

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

If we take realistic values of @xmath between @xmath and @xmath , the
value of @xmath will lie between @xmath and @xmath leading to the values
of @xmath at @xmath between -1.301 and -1.548 respectively, well into
the phantom regime of @xmath . But this is out of 2 @xmath error bar of
@xmath at @xmath of the model presented in this work. Thus the Sen and
Sethi model is allowed but statistically not favoured.

A recent analysis xiaLCDMwCDM using CMB temperature anisotropy and
polarization data, along with other non-CMB data, estimates the values
of the parameters as @xmath at 1 @xmath confidence level for the @xmath
CDM model and @xmath , @xmath at 1 @xmath confidence level for @xmath
CDM model. The present model is inclined towards the @xmath CDM model,
and the value of @xmath remains in between the values obtained for
@xmath CDM and @xmath CDM (within 1 @xmath confidence level of both the
models).

A study of different parameterizations of dark energy equation of state
by Hazra et al hazra has obtained the parameter values in various cases.
For example, Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization cplparam
yields @xmath , @xmath , Scherrer and Sen (SS) parameterization
scherrersen yields @xmath , @xmath and generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG)
parameterization gcgbento ; bentochap2 shows @xmath , @xmath . Hence the
present reconstruction is consistent with the CPL parameterization at 1
@xmath confidence level. The SS parameterization requires a slightly
lower value of @xmath (out of 1 @xmath error bar) but the value of
@xmath is highly consistent. The non phantom prior assumption of GCG
parameterization is not in agreement with the present model, but the
lower bound of 1 @xmath error bar for GCG parameterization is within the
1 @xmath confidence region of the present model.

A reconstruction of quintessence potential described by a polynomial
series constrains the present value of dark energy equation of state
@xmath hupeiris . This is within the 1 @xmath error bar of the present
model.

It deserves mention that systematic uncertainties of observations might
have its imprints on the results of these analyses. For instance, the
colour-luminosity parameter might depend on the redshift, and hence
affect the magnitude in the analysis of Supernova data wangwangSNeSys .
We also refer to the analyses of Rubin et al rubinSNeSys and Shafer and
Huterer shaferSNeSys for some very recent development in connection with
the systematics.

## Chapter 3 A reconstruction of the effective equation of state

### 3.1 Introduction

In this chapter, a parametric reconstruction of the effective or total
equation of state is presented. The functional form of effective
equation of state parameter is chosen in such a way that it tends to
zero at high value of redshift which is the signature of matter
dominated universe. The present value of the effective equation of state
parameter depends on the model parameters which have been constrained
from the observational data.

The present work is not based on a purely kinematical approach, it
rather assumes GR as the theory of gravity, but there is hardly any
prior assumption about the distribution of the components in the matter
sector. The prime endeavour of this reconstruction is to figure out the
distribution of the matter components instead of any prior assumption
about them. The possibility of interaction between the components can
also be investigated in this framework. For comparison, a standard dark
energy model, namely the @xmath CDM, has also been explored using the
same data sets. For the @xmath CDM model, the dark energy equation of
state parameter ( @xmath ) is assumed to be a constant throughout the
evolution. At the same time, the dark matter is allowed to have an
independent conservation. The cosmological constant model or the @xmath
CDM and the @xmath CDM model are at present the most popular dark energy
models as they are well consistent with most of the observational data.
For these reasons, the @xmath CDM model has been chosen in the present
work as an example for a comparison with the reconstructed model.
Different model selection criteria unambiguously show the consistency of
this model with the standard @xmath CDM dark energy model. For direct
comparison, both the models have also been presented through ( @xmath ,
@xmath ) parameter space, where @xmath is the present value of
deceleration parameter and @xmath be the present value of jerk
parameter.

### 3.2 Reconstruction of the model

The Friedmann equations for spatially flat universe are obtained as,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the Hubble parameter defined as @xmath (an over-headed
dot denotes the derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath ), the
@xmath is the total energy density and the @xmath is the pressure. Now
the effective or total equation of state parameter ( @xmath ) is defined
as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

This @xmath and @xmath take care of the density and the pressure
respectively for all the forms of the matter present in the universe
taken together. Now using equations ( 3.1 ) and ( 3.2 ), the effective
equation of state parameter is written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

It is convenient to use redshift (z) as the argument instead of cosmic
time @xmath as @xmath is a dimensionless quantity. If the argument of
differentiation of @xmath is changed from cosmic time @xmath to redshift
@xmath , defined as @xmath , where @xmath is the present value of the
scale factor. Now one can write,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the present work, a parametric form of the effective equation of
state @xmath , as a function of redshift @xmath , is assumed as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath are two model parameters. It is now clear from
the observation of large scale structure and the existing models of
structure formation that the contribution to the energy budget of the
universe was dominated by dark matter at high redshift. In the recent
era, the prime contribution is coming from the exotic component dubbed
as dark energy. As the dark matter is pressureless, the effective
equation of state at high redshift was effectively zero. At the epoch of
recent acceleration, it has a negative value which is less than @xmath .
The functional form of the effective equation of state (equation ( 3.6
)) assumed for the present reconstruction can easily accommodate these
two phases of evolution. For positive values of the model parameter
@xmath and @xmath , the values of @xmath tends to zero a high value of
the redshift @xmath whereas at @xmath , its value depends upon the model
parameter @xmath . It is also clear from the expression of @xmath
(equation ( 3.6 )) that a positive value of the model parameter @xmath
always fixes a lower bound to the value of @xmath and keeps it in the
non-phantom regime. It is interesting to note that for @xmath CDM model,
the effective equation of state parameter can be expressed as,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

Thus the parameter @xmath is equivalent to the ratio of dark mattre to
dark energy density at @xmath CDM limit.

Introducing the assumed ansatz of @xmath (equation ( 3.6 )) to equation
( 3.4 ) and ( 3.5 )), the differential equation for @xmath reads as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

The solution obtained for the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift
is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the value of Hubble parameter at @xmath . One
interesting point regarding this expression of Hubble parameter is that
for @xmath , this reproduces the @xmath CDM model. Hence the estimated
value of the model parameter @xmath will clearly indicate whether a
@xmath CDM or a time evolving dark energy is preferred by observations.

It is important to note at this point that in the series expansion of
@xmath (where @xmath ), which can be obtained from equation ( 3.9 ),
there will be a term with @xmath . This corresponds to the dark matter
density. The coefficient of @xmath is @xmath . It is equivalent to the
matter density parameter @xmath which is the ratio of present matter
density and the present critical density ( @xmath ). Thus the
contribution of the dark energy can be obtained by subtracting this term
from @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

( @xmath is the dark energy density scaled by the present critical
density). Similarly the pressure contribution of the dark energy can be
obtained using equation ( 3.1 ) and ( 3.2 ) along with the expression of
Hubble parameter @xmath obtained in equation ( 3.9 ) . Finally the dark
energy equation of state parameter can be written as a function of
redshift and the associated model parameters as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is clear from the expression of @xmath that for @xmath , the value
@xmath , which is the @xmath CDM.

### 3.3 Results of statistical analysis

As already mentioned, four observational data sets, namely OHD, SNe, BAO
and CMBSift, are used in the statistical analysis.

The observational Hubble data set (OHD) is obtained from the measurement
by different groups. Hubble parameter is measured directly from cosmic
chromometres and differential age of galaxies in the redshift range
@xmath simonohd ; sternohd ; chuangohd ; blakeohd ; zhangohd ;
morescoohd . Measurement of Hubble parameter at @xmath by Delubac et al
delubacohd has also been incorporated in the data set.

The distance modulus ( @xmath ) data set from type Ia supernova
observations is very widely used for the analysis of dark energy models.
In this work, the 31 binned distance modulus data sample of the recent
joint light-curve analysis sn3 has been utilized.

Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data (result of 6dF Galaxy Survey at
redshift @xmath (Beutler et al beutlerbao ), and the results of Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) at redshift @xmath (BOSS LOWZ)
and at redshift z = 0.57 (BOSS CMASS)(Anderson et al bossandersonbao )),
along with the measurement of comoving sound horizon at photon
decoupling epoch ( @xmath ) and at photon drag epoch ( @xmath ) and the
estimation of the value of acoustic scale at decoupling obtained from
Planck results planck2013 ; wangwangcmb have been incorporated in the
statistical analysis.

Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, in the form of a distance prior,
namely the CMB shift parameter @xmath , estimated from Planck data in
wangwangcmb , has also been utilized here.

@xmath -minimization technique has been adopted in the present work for
the estimation of the model parameters. Detail discussion about the
observational data sets and the statistical techniques are presented in
the first chapter (section 1.4 and 1.5 ).

Figure 3.1 shows the confidence contours on the two dimensional (2D)
parameter space for the @xmath model for different combinations of the
data sets. Similarly figure 3.2 presents the confidence contours on the
2D parameter space of the @xmath CDM model, which has two parameters,
namely the matter density parameter @xmath and the constant dark energy
equation of state parameter @xmath . Marginalised likelihoods for the
@xmath model and @xmath CDM model are presented in figure 3.3 . It is
clear from the likelihood plots that the likelihood functions are well
fitted to a Gaussian distribution function when all four data sets are
take into account. It is also apparent from the confidence contours
(figure 3.1 and figure 3.2 ) and the likelihood function plots (figure
3.3 ) that the addition of CMB shift parameter data leads to
substantially tighter constraints on the model parameters for both the
models.

Table 3.1 contains the results obtained from the statistical analysis
combining OHD, SNe, BAO and CMB shift parameter data. The parameter
values and the associated 1 @xmath uncertainty have been presented along
with the reduced @xmath i.e. @xmath , where @xmath is the degrees of
freedom of the associated @xmath . The reduced @xmath is a measure of
the goodness of the fitting. The fitting would be rated to be good if
the value of reduced @xmath is close to one.

The model parameter @xmath is important to figure out the deviation of
the reconstructed model from the @xmath CDM. for @xmath , the
reconstructed model actually becomes the @xmath CDM. The confidence
contours obtained from different combinations of the data sets show that
the @xmath CDM is always within 1 @xmath confidence regions. The result
obtained from the analysis using only the SNe and OHD shows a higher
deviation of the best fit value of the parameter @xmath from the
corresponding @xmath CDM value than the results obtained by introducing
the BAO and CMB shift parameter data along with SNe and OHD (figure 3.1
and the upper right panel of figure 3.3 ). The associated uncertainty
obtained from the analysis with SNe+OHD is very large (left panel of
figure 3.1 ) and the constraints become tighter with the addition of
other data sets, namely the BAO and CMB shift parameter (middle and
right panels of figure 3.1 ). The best fit value of @xmath obtained for
SNe+OHD is less than 3 (left panel of figure 3.1 ), for SNe+OHD+BAO it
is greater than 3 (middle panel of figure 3.1 ) and for
SNe+HOD+BAO+CMBShift, it is slightly less that 3 (right panel of figure
3.1 ). So it is apparent that the nature of deviation from @xmath CDM
varies according to the combination of data sets used for the analysis.
It also deserves mention that the addition of CMB shift parameter data
keeps the model in close proximity of @xmath CDM and also ensures much
tighter constraints on the parameter values. Another interesting point
to note is that the parameters of the reconstructed @xmath model have a
negative correlation between them for all the combinations of the data
sets considered in the present analysis (figure 3.1 ). But for @xmath
CDM model, the nature of correlation between the parameter changes for
different combinations of the data sets (figure 3.2 ). For the analysis
with SNe+OHD and SNe+OHD+BAO the parameters of @xmath CDM have a
negative correlation but the correlation is positive when the CMB shift
parameter data is taken into account.

The deceleration parameter, a dimensionless representation of the second
order time derivative of the scale factor, is defined as @xmath . It can
also be written in terms of Hubbele parameter and its derivative with
respect to redshift as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

For the present @xmath model, the expression of the deceleration
parameter is obtained as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

In figure 3.4 , the plot of effective equation of state parameter (
@xmath ) and the deceleration parameter ( @xmath ) as functions of
redshift @xmath for both the @xmath model and @xmath CDM model have been
presented. The central dark lines represent for the best fit curves and
the 1 @xmath and 2 @xmath confidence region are given from inner to
outer part.

Figure 3.4 reveals the fact that the effective equation of state (
@xmath ) and deceleration parameter ( @xmath ) evolve in very similar
way for both the models. For the proposed model, the deceleration
parameter shows a signature flip in between the redshift value @xmath to
@xmath , which is well consistent with the analysis of observational
data by Farooq and Ratra ( farooqratra, ) . Similar behaviour has been
obtained for @xmath CDM model also.

Figure 3.5 shows the plots of dark energy energy equation of state
parameter @xmath and cosmic jerk parameter @xmath for both the models.
The jerk parameter @xmath , which is the dimensionless representation of
the 3rd order time derivative of the scale factor @xmath , is defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is sometimes defined without the negative sign. In the present work,
this convention has been used similar to that in reference ( zhaijerk, )
. The jerk parameter can also be expressed in terms of Hubble parameter
and its derivative with respect to redshift as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

and for the present model, the expression is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

The jerk parameter is also important to understand the deviation of the
model from @xmath CDM as for a universe with cosmological constant and
cold dark matter, the value of jerk parameter is always @xmath . The
dark energy equation of state remains almost flat and shows the
preference toward the non-phantom nature of dark energy for the
reconstructed @xmath model (upper left panel of figure 3.5 ). That means
its behaviour is very similar to that of @xmath CDM model. The plots of
@xmath and cosmological jerk @xmath show that tighter constraints on
their present values are obtained for the reconstructed model than the
@xmath CDM.

For the reconstructed @xmath model, plots (upper panels of figure 3.5 )
show that the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath is better
constrained at low redshift but the jerk parameter @xmath is better
constrained at high redshift. The plots also show that the best fit
value of @xmath has higher deviation from @xmath at high redshift and on
the other hand the best fit value of @xmath has a higher deviation from
the corresponding @xmath CDM value at low redshift. It also indicates
that the reconstructed model allows a wide variation of the value of
@xmath at high redshift, but the value of the jerk parameter @xmath is
not allowed to have a wide variation at high redshift. The plot of jerk
parameter @xmath for the @xmath CDM model (lower right panel of figure
3.5 ) also shows a similar behaviour. Actually the dark energy equation
of state or the deceleration parameter are highly sensitive to the
matter dark energy ratio through the parameter @xmath and thus they are
better constrained at low redshift. But the jerk parameter is more
sensitive to the existence of the early matter dominated era through the
parameter @xmath (equation ( 3.16 )) and hence it is better constrained
at high redshift.

For statistical comparison of the @xmath model to the @xmath CDM model,
two model selection criterion have been invoked, the Akaike information
criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). These have
been discussed in details in section 1.5.3 . For the @xmath model in
comparison with @xmath CDM, the @xmath AIC and @xmath BIC vales are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here @xmath AIC and @xmath BIC are equal as both the models have two
free parameters and the number of data points used of the statistical
analysis are same for both the models. The reconstruction of the
parametric effective equation of state parameter @xmath , which is
independent of any prior assumption regarding the nature of dark energy,
is highly consistent with the dynamical dark energy model, namely the
@xmath CDM model.

### 3.4 Representation on @xmath parameter space

For a direct comparison between these two models it would be convenient
to look at them through the same parameter space. Now the present value
of deceleration parameter @xmath and present value of the jerk parameter
@xmath can be used as the parameters replacing the corresponding model
parameters. The @xmath and @xmath can be obtained from equations ( 3.13
) and ( 3.16 ) respectively, as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

From these two equations, namely equation ( 3.19 ) and ( 3.20 ), the
model parameter @xmath and @xmath can be expressed in terms of @xmath
and @xmath . Substituting those expressions of @xmath and @xmath in
equation ( 3.9 ), @xmath for the reconstructed model can be written in
terms of @xmath and @xmath as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the same way, the Hubble parameter for @xmath CDM model can be
expressed in terms of parameters @xmath and @xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

A similar statistical analysis has been carried out to estimates the
values of the kinematical parameters @xmath and @xmath for both the
models. Different model selection criteria and the Bayesian evidence are
obviously important to judge the consistency between the models. But the
representation of the models on the same parameter space is important to
understand whether the models allow any common region on the parameter
space. It also shows whether the nature of correlation between the
parameters are same for both the models.

Table 3.2 presents the results of statistical analysis, obtained from
the statistical analysis combining SNe, OHD, BAO and CMB shift parameter
data, for the reconstructed @xmath model and @xmath CDM models on (
@xmath , @xmath ) parameter space. Figure 3.6 and figure 3.7 show the 2D
confidence contours on ( @xmath , @xmath ) parameter space. Figure 3.8
shows the marginalised likelihood with @xmath and @xmath as the
arguments for both the models.

Though the best fit value of the parameters @xmath and @xmath obtained
for both the models are close enough, the present @xmath model minimizes
the uncertainty of the parameter values. This is also consistent with
the results obtained from figure 3.5 .

The representation of the reconstructed model and the @xmath CDM model
on the ( @xmath , @xmath ) parameter space (figure 3.6 and figure 3.7 )
clearly show that the confidence contours of the models are consistent
with each other and the correlations between the parameters are very
much similar for both the models. It is also clear that substantially
tighter constraint on the present value of cosmological jerk parameter (
@xmath ) has been achieved for the model reconstructed in the present
work than the @xmath CDM dark energy model.

### 3.5 Discussion

In the present work, a model is built up by considering a parametric
form of the effective equation of state parameter. The constraints on
the model parameters of the @xmath CDM model have also been obtained
using the same sets of data. The idea is to draw a direct comparison
between these two models. Different model selection criteria clearly
indicate the consistency between the @xmath CDM and the model
reconstructed in the present work.

The model parameter @xmath is an indicator of deviation of the model
from cosmological constant. Now the value of @xmath obtained from the
likelihood analysis is very close to @xmath which indicates that the
reconstructed @xmath is in close proximity of @xmath CDM. As already
mentioned that the the contour plots along with the best fit points
(figure 3.1 ) and the likelihood plots (upper right panel of figure 3.3
) show that the amount of deviations of the model from @xmath CDM vary
for different combinations of the data sets. The addition of CMB shift
brings the best fit value of the model parameter @xmath very close to
the corresponding @xmath CDM value and much tighter constraints have
also been achieved. In the series expansion expansion of @xmath , there
is a term evolving as @xmath . This is equivalent to the matter density
and the constant coefficient of this term is the present matter density
parameter ( @xmath ). For the reconstructed @xmath model, the value of
the model parameters obtained are @xmath and @xmath at 1 @xmath
confidence level. As the parameter @xmath is connected to the matter
density parameter ( @xmath ), the value of @xmath obtained for this
model is @xmath , which is consistent with the value obtained from the
same analysis for @xmath CDM model.

A recent analysis of @xmath CDM and @xmath CDM model by Xia, Li and
Zhang ( xiaLCDMwCDM, ) , using the CMB temperature anisotropy and
polarization data along with other non-CMB data, estimates the value of
the matter density parameter @xmath at 1 @xmath confidence level for
@xmath CDM and @xmath at 1 @xmath confidence level for @xmath CDM. Hence
the value of the matter density parameter obtained in the present work
is very close to the value obtained for @xmath CDM by Xia, Li and Zhang
( xiaLCDMwCDM, ) . A recent analysis by Hazra et al ( hazra, ) has
presented the analysis of different parameterizations of dark energy
using various recent observational data sets. The parameter values
obtained are @xmath , @xmath for Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL)
parametrization ( cplparam, ) , @xmath , @xmath for Scherrer and Sen
(SS) parameterization ( scherrersen, ) and @xmath , @xmath for
generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) model ( gcgbento, ) . It is clear that
the CPL parameterization is in good agreement with the presently
reconstructed @xmath model. But the SS parameterization has a preference
towards a lower value of the dark energy equation of state though the
value of matter density parameter is within 1 @xmath confidence region
of the reconstructed model. The non-phantom prior assumption of GCG
parameterization is in good agreement with the present @xmath model,
though the present model also allows the phantom behaviour within 1
@xmath confidence level. The GCG has a clear preference towards a higher
value of the matter density.

The plot of deceleration parameter @xmath (upper left panel of figure
3.4 ) shows that the reconstructed model successfully generates the late
time acceleration along with the decelerated expansion phase which
prevailed before the accelerated expansion phase. The redshift of
transition from decelerated to accelerated phase of expansion lies in
between the redshift range 0.6 to 0.8 which is consistent with the
recent analysis by Farooq and Ratra farooqratra .

The equation of state parameter of dark energy achieved for the model
presented here remains almost constant. The nature of effective equation
of state ( @xmath ) and the deceleration parameter @xmath are also very
much similar to that of @xmath CDM model (figure 3.4 ). Figure 3.5
presents the plots of @xmath and @xmath for the reconstructed @xmath
model and the @xmath CMD model. It is clear from the plots that the
reconstructed model puts tighter constraints on the present values of
dark energy equation of state parameter ( @xmath ) and cosmological jerk
( @xmath ) than the @xmath CDM model. Another interesting point is that
the uncertainties associated to the value of @xmath and @xmath vary
according to its deviations from the @xmath CDM. A higher deviation of
the best fit value from the corresponding @xmath CDM value increases the
associated uncertainty. It is also apparently clear from figure 3.5 that
the reconstructed @xmath model allows a wide variation for the value of
dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath at high redshift, but the
value of the jerk parameter @xmath at high redshift is not allowed to
have a wide variation.

It deserves mention that the systematics of supernova data has been
taken into account as it might have its signature on the results. The
effect of redshift dependence of colour-luminosity parameter of distance
modulus measurement has been discussed by Wang and Wang wangwangSNeSys .
There are some recent discussion on the impact of supernova systematics
which can also be referred to in this context rubinSNeSys ; shaferSNeSys
.

## Chapter 4 Reconstruction of the cosmological jerk parameter

### 4.1 Introduction

This chapter is devoted to the discussion of a kinematic reconstruction
of cosmological models. Reconstruction of a dark energy (DE), that
drives the current acceleration of the universe, normally involves
finding the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath , given by
@xmath , where @xmath and @xmath represent the contribution to the
pressure and the density respectively by the DE sainireconst ;
vsahniaasrarore . There are only a few attempts to find a suitable model
by a reconstruction of the kinematical quantities like the deceleration
parameter or higher order derivatives of the scale factor. In spite of
its being the natural choice amongst the kinematical quantities, as
discussed in the introduction, the jerk parameter @xmath , given by
@xmath , has only a limited application until now in the context of the
accelerated expansion. Cosmological jerk parameter has been used as a
diagnostic of dark energy models by Sahni et al. sahnistatefinder and
Alam et al. alamstatefinder . The jerk parameter and a combination of
jerk and deceleration parameter together have been identified as the
statefinder parameter in these two investigations. Visser visser
initiated a serious discussion on the jerk parameter, albeit from a
different motivation. The idea was to look at the equation of state of
the cosmic fluid as a Taylor expansion in terms of a background density.
Analytical expressions for kinematical parameters, constructed by
involving higher order derivatives of the scale factor in various forms
of matter in a Friedmann universe, had been presented by Dunajski and
Gibbons dunajskigibbons .

A reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state through a
parametrization of the jerk parameter has been very recently given by
Luongo luongojerk . A systematic study of jerk as the way towards
building up a model for the accelerated expansion was given by Rapetti
et al rapettijerk . In an exhaustive recent work by Zhai et al zhaijerk
, a reconstruction of @xmath has been attempted. For four different
forms of @xmath , they fixed the parameters in @xmath by using
observational Hubble parameter data (OHD) and supernovae (SNe) data. The
present chapter is based on the reconstruction of cosmological jerk
parameter from diverse observational data sets.

It should be clearly mentioned that the equation of state parameter
@xmath , the energy density of the dark energy, the potential of the
quintessence field etc. are all part of the theoretical input, and hence
constitute the fundamental ingredients of the model. The deceleration
parameter, the jerk etc. are kinematical quantities, and thus are the
outcome of the solution of the system of equations of the model. So no
wonder that a reconstruction of @xmath holds the centre-stage in
attempts towards building up a model for the accelerating universe.
However, it should be mentioned that the basic advantage of this kind of
reconstruction through kinematical quantities neither assumes any theory
of gravity (like GR, @xmath gravity, scalar-tensor theory etc.) nor does
it assume a given matter distribution like a quintessence field or any
other exotic matter through any equation of state to start with. Thus,
this reconstruction may lead to some understanding of the basic matter
distribution and the possible interaction amongst themselves without any
a priori assumptions on them.

The motivation of the present work is to reconstruct a dark energy model
through the jerk parameter @xmath . If @xmath is known as @xmath or
@xmath , the third order differential equation for the scale factor is
known and hence one can find the evolution, at least in principle. It is
wellknown that the @xmath CDM model does very well in explaining the
present acceleration of the universe but fails to match the
theoretically predicted value of @xmath . Thus the attempts to build up
dark energy models hover around finding one which in the limit of @xmath
(the present epoch) resembles a @xmath CDM model. The work by Zhai et al
zhaijerk is also along that line. For a @xmath CDM model, one has a
constant @xmath as @xmath . Zhai et al wrote their ansatz in such a way
that the present value of @xmath is actually @xmath , i.e., @xmath . All
the four different forms of @xmath , they wrote, have this feature.

The present work is more general in two different ways. First, the
functional form of @xmath in this work is more relaxed in the sense that
its present value depends on a parameter to be fixed by observations,
and is allowed to have a value widely different from @xmath at @xmath ,
if so required by the data sets. In this work, different ansatzs for
@xmath are taken, all of which are quite free to take values very much
different from @xmath . The second point is related to sophistication,
rather than principle, in the sense that where Zhai et al used a
combination of two data sets namely the OHD and the SNe, we have a
combination of four data sets. In addition to the two used by Zhai et al
, the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data and the very recent CMB
shift parameter (CMBShift) data have also been incorporated in the
present work. As a result, the parameters of the theory are constrained
to narrower limits. The results obtained by the present work also show
that the observations very strongly indicate an inclination towards a
@xmath CDM behaviour of the present distribution of matter with a
marginal preference towards a non-phantom behaviour.

### 4.2 Kinematical quantities

The kinematical quantities in cosmology are constructed from the scale
factor @xmath and its time derivatives. The Hubble parameter ( @xmath )
is defined as @xmath , where a dot indicates derivative with respect to
@xmath . Similarly the deceleration parameter @xmath and the jerk
parameter @xmath are defined as,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

One can extend this chain of derivatives, such as the fourth order
derivative, called the snap parameter @xmath can be defined as @xmath
and so on visser . We shall however, restrict to the third derivative,
namely the jerk parameter, as the evolution of @xmath is of physical
interest now. It is to be noted that in defining @xmath , there are two
conventions of using a positive or a negative sign. We have adopted the
convention as used by Zhai et al zhaijerk and not the one used by Visser
visser and Luongo luongojerk . This preference is only because we shall
compare our results with that of Zhai et al zhaijerk .

Hubble parameter @xmath can also be written as a function of the
redshift @xmath , as @xmath . Redshift @xmath is defined as @xmath ,
where @xmath is the present value of the scale factor. The deceleration
parameter @xmath and the jerk parameter @xmath can be written in terms
of @xmath with @xmath as the argument as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where a prime denotes the derivative with respect to the redshift @xmath
.

### 4.3 Reconstruction of jerk parameter

Einstein’s field equations for a spatially flat homogeneous and
isotropic universe are,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the density of the pressureless dust matter, @xmath and
@xmath are the contribution of the dark energy to the energy density and
pressure sector. An overhead dot represents the differentiation with
respect to the time.

For @xmath CDM cosmology, jerk parameter (defined in 4.4 ) is a constant
with the value @xmath . We follow the parametric reconstruction of
@xmath in the similar line as discussed by Zhai et al zhaijerk . The
major difference, as discussed before, is that we do not restrict to
@xmath for @xmath . So we do not assume a @xmath CDM for the present
universe a priori , but rather allow the model to behave in a more
general way. The present value of @xmath is allowed to be fixed by the
observational data. We write the jerk parameter as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a constant, @xmath is the Hubble parameter scaled by its
present value and @xmath is an analytic function of @xmath . Four ansatz
for @xmath have been chosen in the present work, which will be discussed
separately. Here @xmath is the model parameter to be fixed by
observational data. Model I is the one where the evolution of @xmath is
taken care of solely by @xmath . For the other three, the redshift
@xmath also contributes explicitly and not through @xmath alone. The
four ansatz chosen are given below,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

By substituting these expressions in the definition of @xmath , given by
equation ( 4.4 ), one can get the solutions for @xmath as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here @xmath and @xmath are integration constants. Now from the scaling
@xmath , one has the constraint @xmath , which connects the constants as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

Thus each of the models have two independent parameters, @xmath . It is
quite apparent from the expression of @xmath , through the Einstein’s
field equation, @xmath , that the parameter @xmath is equivalent to the
matter density parameter @xmath which is the ratio of present matter
density ( @xmath ) and present critical density ( @xmath ). Equations (
4.13 ), ( 4.14 ) and ( 4.15 ) show that effectively one has a cold dark
matter, a cosmological constant and another component of dark energy of
the form @xmath where @xmath is a negative constant. For the first
choice of the model in equation ( 4.12 ), the dark energy is not given
by such a simple equation of state.

The properties of dark energy can also be ascertained to a certain
extent from the analytic expressions of the Hubble parameter for the
models. As the dust matter is minimally coupled to the dark energy for
these models, the dark energy density scaled by critical density can be
expressed as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

The contribution of dark energy to the pressure sector can be obtained
from equation ( 4.6 ) as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

Finally the dark energy equation of state parameter can be expressed as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

The analytical expressions of @xmath obtained for the models are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

The statistical analysis have been carried out using various
combinations of the data sets. Four different observational data sets
have been used for the statistical analysis of the model in the present
work. These are the observational Hubble data (OHD), distance modulus
data from type Ia supernove (SNe), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)
data along with the value of acoustic scale at photon electron
decoupling and the ratio of comoving sound horizon at decoupling and at
drag epoch estimated from CMB radiation power spectrum and the CMB shift
parameter (CMBShift) data.

The observational Hubble data set (OHD) is obtained from the measurement
by different groups. Hubble parameter is measured directly from cosmic
chromometres and differential age of galaxies in the redshift range
@xmath simonohd ; sternohd ; chuangohd ; blakeohd ; zhangohd ;
morescoohd . Measurement of Hubble parameter at @xmath by Delubac et al
delubacohd has also been incorporated in the data set.

The distance modulus ( @xmath ) data set from type Ia supernova
observations is very widely used one for the analysis of dark energy
models. In this work, the 31 binned distance modulus data sample of the
recent joint light-curve analysis sn3 has been utilized.

Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data (result of 6dF Galaxy Survey at
redshift @xmath (Beutler et al beutlerbao ), and the results of Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) at redshift @xmath (BOSS LOWZ)
and at redshift z = 0.57 (BOSS CMASS)(Anderson et al bossandersonbao )),
along with the measurement of comoving sound horizon at photon
decoupling epoch ( @xmath ) and at photon drag epoch ( @xmath ) and the
estimation of the value of acoustic scale at decoupling obtained from
Planck results planck2013 ; wangwangcmb have been incorporated in the
statistical analysis.

Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, in the form of a distance prior,
namely the CMB shift parameter, estimated from Planck data in
wangwangcmb , has also been utilized here.

The constraints on the parameters are obtained by the @xmath
minimization or equivalently the maximum likelihood analysis. The
statistical techniques regarding the parameter estimation has been
discussed in detail in section 1.5 .

Figure 4.1 shows the confidence contours on the 2D parameter space (
@xmath , @xmath ) of Model I obtained for various combinations of the
data sets. Figure 4.2 presents the marginalised likelihood as functions
of the model parameters @xmath and @xmath for Model I obtained for
SNe+OHD+BAO +CMBShift data. The likelihood functions are well fitted to
Gaussian distribution function with the best-fit parameter values @xmath
and @xmath . Table 4.1 presents the results of statistical analysis for
Model I. It is clear from the results that the addition of CMB shift
parameter data leads to a substantial improvement of the parameter
constraints.

Similarly the figure 4.3 presents the confidence contours on the
parameter space for Model II and figure 4.4 shows the marginalised
likelihood functions. In table 4.2 the results of the statistical
analysis are presented. Figure 4.5 and 4.6 are of Model III and table
4.3 presents the results of corresponding statistical analysis. And
figure 4.7 and 4.8 and table 4.4 correspond to Model IV.

It is clear from the contour plots on the parameter space that the
addition of CMB shift parameter data leads to tighter constraints on the
model parameters. The parameters show a negative correlation between
then in the analysis with SNe, OHD and BAO data. But the addition of CMB
shift parameter data changes the nature of correlation and makes it
slightly positive. All the likelihood function plots are well fitted to
Gaussian distribution. As the model parameter @xmath indicates the
deviation of the models from @xmath CDM (for @xmath CDM @xmath ), it is
important to note that @xmath CDM remains within the @xmath confidence
regions of all the models.

Figure 4.9 shows the plots of dark energy equation of state parameter as
a function of redshift @xmath and figure 4.10 presents the plots of
deceleration parameter @xmath for different models discussed in the
present work. The deceleration parameter plots clearly show that the
models successfully generate the late time acceleration along with the
decelerated expansion in the past. The plots show the transition from
decelerated to accelerated expansion phase took place in the redshift
range @xmath . This is consistent with the recent analysis by Farooq and
Ratra farooqratra where constraints on the transition redshift are
achieved for different dark energy scenario using observational Hubble
data. All the models presented in this work show the dark energy
equation of state parameter to be almost constant and the best fit
values at present are slightly higher than @xmath , meaning the models
prefer the non-phantom nature of dark energy.

Figure 4.11 shows the plots of jerk parameter @xmath for the models. It
is interesting to note that @xmath is allowed by the models to take
values different from that in the case of @xmath CDM at @xmath . All the
four different models show a tendency close the @xmath CDM along with a
range of possibilities for @xmath at the present epoch, in the 2 @xmath
confidence region.

### 4.4 A Bayesian analysis

The two commonly used criteria for model selection are Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) aic and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
bic . These are defined as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the maximum likelihood, @xmath is the number of free
parameters in the model and @xmath is the number of data points used for
the statistical analysis of the model. We note that these two criteria
can hardly provide any information regarding the model selection amongst
the four presented here because the values of @xmath do not differ
significantly for the models and all the models have same number of
parameters as well as same number of data points have been used for the
statistical analysis of the models.

As there is hardly any model to choose based on the information
criteria, it is thus useful to look for an evidence estimate for the
model selection. The Bayesian evidence @xmath is defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are model parameters. There are two parameters in the
models @xmath and @xmath . With a flat prior approximation, the
evidences calculated for the models are

Model I: @xmath ,

Model II: @xmath ,

Model III: @xmath ,

Model IV: @xmath ,

where @xmath is the constant prior. These evidences show that there is
hardly any model, amongst the four presented, does better than any of
the other three. However, if there is any one to choose amongst these,
Model IV is the one which does marginally better than the other three.
On the other hand, Model III is less preferred than the others.

### 4.5 Discussion

The reconstruction discussed in the present chapter deals with a
parametric reconstruction of the jerk parameter @xmath which is the
dimensionless representation of the third order time derivative of the
scale factor. As the deceleration parameter @xmath is now an
observational quantity and found to be evolving, jerk, amongst the
kinematical quantities, appears to be the natural choice as the quantity
of interest, as this determines the evolution of @xmath . The philosophy
is to build up the model from the evolution history of the universe. As
such this is just another way of reconstruction, but it might indicate
about the nature of matter distribution and the possible interaction
amongst them without any a priori assumption on them. This may
particularly be useful as there is not yet a clear verdict in favour of
any model.

The formalism proposed by Zhai et al zhaijerk has been utilized in the
present work, with a major difference that @xmath at @xmath is allowed
to pick up any value depending on a parameter to be fixed by the data as
opposed to the work of Zhai et al where @xmath is constrained to mimic a
@xmath CDM at the present epoch given by @xmath . One interesting
feature of this formalism is that the matter density parameter ( @xmath
) automatically selects itself as a model parameter.

The plots of the dark energy equation of state parameter ( @xmath ) and
the deceleration parameter ( @xmath ) for the proposed models (figure
4.9 and figure 4.10 respectively) clearly show that the models can
successfully generate late time acceleration along with a decelerated
expansion in the past. The range of redshift of transition from
decelerated to accelerated expansion as indicated in the present work is
consistent with the result of a recent analysis by Farooq and Ratra
farooqratra . The model parameter @xmath is an indicator of the
deviation of the model from @xmath CDM. For all the four models, the
best fit present value of jerk parameter estimated from the
observational data are slightly greater than @xmath but @xmath remains
within 1 @xmath confidence region. Thus all these models are very close
to the @xmath CDM, but with an inclination towards a non-phantom nature
of dark energy.

The values estimated for the parameter @xmath , which is equivalent to
the matter density parameter, are consistent with the results of the
recent analysis of @xmath CDM and @xmath CDM models using the CMB
temperature anisotropy and polarization data along with the other
non-CMB data xiaLCDMwCDM .

A constant value of jerk is in fact allowed in all the four models
within 1 @xmath confidence level (figure 4.11 ). But the particular
value estimated by Rapetti et al rapettijerk is out of 1 @xmath
confidence region of the present models. An evolving jerk parameter had
been discussed by Zhai et al zhaijerk where only the supernova distance
modulus data (SNe) and observational Hubble data (OHD) were used for the
statistical analysis of the models. In the present work, though the same
mathematical formulation has been used as Zhai et al , tighter
constraints on the parameter @xmath have been achieved by introducing
the BAO and CMB shift parameter data along with SNe and OHD.

We can construct a quintessence potential associated to the models. If
we consider the dark energy contribution is coming from a quintessence
scalar field @xmath , then the dark energy density ( @xmath ) and the
pressure ( @xmath ) can be expressed as @xmath and @xmath where @xmath
is the quintessence potential. As the expressions of Hubble parameter
are known for the models, the quintessence potential can be expressed as
a function of the model parameters and redshift using equation ( 4.5 )
and ( 4.6 ). The upper panels of figure 4.12 show the evolution of
@xmath , where @xmath . The lower panels of figure 4.12 show the
evolution of the potential V, scaled by critical density ( @xmath ), as
a function of @xmath . The best fit curve of the potential remains
almost constant. Thus it is neither freezing nor thawing caldwelllinder
; scherrersen but rather a constant, leading to a slow-roll scalar
field.

The systematic uncertainties of supernova observations are considered in
the statistical analysis presented here as some of them might have their
say as well on the results, such as the colour-luminosity parameter
might depend on the redshift, and hence affects the magnitude in the
analysis of Supernova data wangwangSNeSys . There are some recent
discussion rubinSNeSys ; shaferSNeSys on the effects of systematics
which may be worthwhile in any analysis. It deserves mention that CMB
data has been used to remove the dependence of the sound horizon in the
case of the BAO data. The measurement of the acoustic scale @xmath and
the CMB shift parameter are somewhat correlated. This correlation,
calculated from the normalized covariance matrix given by Wang and Wang
wangwangcmb , is not too large and not likely to change the results
significantly. So this correlation is ignored in the present work.

The main conclusion, therefore, is that the @xmath CDM is very close to
be the winner as the candidate for the favoured model with a marginal
inclination towards a non-phantom behaviour of the universe. However,
the present work deals with situations each of which yields the @xmath
CDM model as a special case ( @xmath ). Anyway, a large departure from
the @xmath CDM has not been ruled out ab inito, the reconstructed value
of @xmath shoulders the task of the determination of the departure. The
statistical analysis, however shows that @xmath is very close to zero,
thus the existence of the varying dark energy with a negative equation
state is not really favoured. As revealed by equations ( 4.14 ), in the
model III, @xmath is equivalent to the flatness constraint (curvature
index @xmath ). So the small values of @xmath in this model also
indicates that spatial flatness is favoured, although a a nonzero
spatial curvature is not ruled out.

## Chapter 5 In search of the dark matter dark energy interaction: a
kinematic approach

### 5.1 Introduction

The present chapter contains an investigation regarding the kinematical
approach to the dark energy reconstruction where the possibility of
interaction between dark energy and dark matter has been included. The
normal practice in cosmology is to write down Einstein equations, @xmath
for a spatially homogeneous and isotropic model with the right hand side
taking care of the matter sector. The present work has a completely
different approach. We assume a spatially flat homogeneous and isotropic
metric and define the usual kinematical quantities like the Hubble
parameter @xmath , the deceleration parameter @xmath and the jerk
parameter @xmath , which are respectively the first order, second order
and third order time derivatives of the scale factor @xmath . The
derivatives are all fractional derivatives and furthermore @xmath and
@xmath are dimensionless. We have observational results of the evolution
of @xmath , in the sense that the parameter is negative at the present
epoch and had been positive in a recent past, the epoch of transition
from the decelerated to the accelerated expansion is also known. The
natural choice of the kinematical quantity of interest is thus the
evolution of @xmath , which is the jerk parameter @xmath . We now assume
a slowly varying jerk and find the evolution of the other kinematical
quantities from the definition of jerk. The values of the model
parameters are then estimated from observational data sets and the
nature of evolution of different cosmological quantities are also
figured out.

As already mentioned, the jerk parameter had hardly been used until very
recently. However, its importance in building a cosmological model had
been emphasized long back in terms of a state-finder parameter
sahnistatefinder . The indication of importance of jerk as a future tool
for the reconstruction of cosmological models was also indicated by Alam
et al alamstatefinder . The reason for its being overlooked as the
starting point of reconstruction was perhaps the unavailability of clean
data. Reconstruction of dark energy model using deceleration parameter (
@xmath ) and jerk ( @xmath ) as model parameters was discussed by
Rapetti et al. rapettijerk where the present values of the kinematical
parameters have been constrained using observational data.
Parametrization of time evolving jerk parameter models have been
discussed recently by Zhai et al. zhaijerk .

If the agent driving the present acceleration is the cosmological
constant, then certainly the dark matter sector follows its own
conservation equation. However, if the dark energy is an evolving one,
there is always a possibility that the two dark sectors interact with
each other, one may grow at the expense of the other. Naturally there is
a lot of work in the literature where the interacting dark energy model
has been discussed. An interacting dark energy model has been given by
Pan, Bhattacharaya and Chakraborty PanBhattacharaya2015 where the
interaction term is assumed to be proportional to the total energy
density. Interacting holographic dark energy model has been discussed by
Zimdahl and Pavon ZimdahlPavon2007 . For a graceful entry of the
universe from a decelerated to an accelerated phase in Brans-Dicke
theory, the interaction of the Brans-Dicke scalar field and the
quintessence scalar field had been discussed by Das and Banerjee
DasBanerjee2006 . An attempt towards a covariant Lagrangian formulation
of the interaction has been made by Faraoni, Dent and Saridakis
FaraoniDentSaridakis2014 .

Reconstruction of the interaction rate in holographic dark energy model
has been discussed by Sen and Pavon SenPavon2008 where the
reconstruction has been done with a prior assumption about the dark
energy equation of state. Recently a non-parametric reconstruction of
dark energy interaction using Gaussian process has been discussed by
Yang, Guo and Cai YangGuoCai2015 where the signature of dark energy
interaction has been obtained for a deviation of dark energy equation of
state parameter from the value @xmath .

The present work is an attempt to reconstruct the possible interaction
of various matter components from the data sets via a kinematical
approach. The starting point is the assumption of a slowly varying jerk
parameter which is effectively a constant at low redshift regime. The
result is that any deviation from the @xmath CDM model indicates a
possibility of an interaction amongst various matter sectors. The best
fit values, however, are tantalizingly close to the @xmath CDM scenario.
Another important result is that the allowance of any interaction is
more stringent at recent times, but slightly more relaxed in the past.

It should also be mentioned at the outset that the entire work depends
upon the dogma that a @xmath CDM model should be included as a
possibility, in an endeavour leading to the reconstruction of the dark
energy, at least as a limit.

### 5.2 Reconstruction of the model

The fractional rate of expansion of the linear size of the universe,
dubbed as the Hubble parameter, is defined as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the overhead dot denotes a derivative with respect to the cosmic
time @xmath . To understand the nature of the expansion, higher order
time derivatives of the scale factor are to be invoked. The measure of
cosmic acceleration is presented in a dimensionless way by the
deceleration parameter @xmath , defined as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

If the value of the deceleration parameter is negative, then the
expansion is accelerated.

The cosmological jerk parameter , which is the dimensionless
representation of the third order time derivative of the scale factor,
is defined as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

From the equation ( 5.3 ), the expression for the jerk parameter can
also be expressed as,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , ( @xmath being the present value of the Hubble parameter)
and a prime denotes the derivative with respect to redshift @xmath . In
the present work, the reconstruction is done with the assumption that
@xmath is a slowly varying quantity, and will be considered a constant
in the subsequent discussion. The solution of the differential equation
( 5.4 ) yields the expression of @xmath as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath are the constant dimensionless coefficients. Now
the relation between @xmath and @xmath is obtained from the boundary
condition @xmath as @xmath . So @xmath is written as a function of
redshift @xmath and two parameters @xmath and @xmath as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, this is effectively a two parameter model where @xmath and
@xmath are the model parameters. The value of @xmath obtained from the
statistical analysis of the reconstructed model using different
observational data would indicate the consistency or deviation of this
model from the @xmath CDM. It actually mimics the @xmath CDM for @xmath
. The deceleration parameter (defined in equation ( 5.2 )) can also be
expressed for the present model in terms of the model parameters and the
redshift as,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

One component of the matter sector of the Universe, whether it interacts
with the dark energy sector or not, is generally believed to be a cold
dark matter with an equation of state @xmath . If we stick to this
presupposition, and attempt to recover a non-interacting pressureless
fluid at least as a limit from equation ( 5.6 ) for some value of @xmath
, we find that the second term of the right hand side of equation ( 5.6
) can yield a highest power of @xmath as @xmath and can not serve the
purpose. The only possibility that remains is @xmath which yield the
standard @xmath behaviour in the first term. So we identify the first
term to represent the contribution from the cold dark matter, which, in
the non-interacting limit yields a @xmath behaviour as in the standard
dust model. For the rest of the work will depend on this identification.
One should note that this is not the only possibility. It may well be
possible to find a corresponding pressure to each of the contribution to
the matter sector so that both the components conserve by themselves.
One can easily calculate the equation of state parameter @xmath (given
by @xmath ) for both the contributions. A straightforward calculation
for a constant @xmath will yield

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

It is easy to see that @xmath again gives two solutions of equation (
5.7 ) @xmath and @xmath leading to a @xmath CDM behaviour where @xmath
corresponds to the cold dark matter and @xmath corresponds to the
cosmological constant. However, this will not lead to any interaction.
One should also note that starting from the definition of the jerk
parameter (equation ( 5.3 )), with the assumption that @xmath is a
constant, one actually recovers one of the Einstein’s equations for the
system, where the nature of the matter sector depends on the value of
the parameter @xmath .

Another important point to be noted is that the parameter @xmath is
equivalent to the matter density parameter @xmath because for @xmath ,
the power of @xmath in the first term on the right hand side of equation
( 5.6 ) is 3 and the second term is a constant, equivalent to the
constant vacuum energy density. If the power of @xmath in the first term
is different from 3, the dark matter is not separately conserved. This
invokes the possibility of interaction between the dark matter and the
dark energy.

To investigate the nature of interaction for the present model, the
total conservation equation which is a direct consequence of contracted
Bianchi identity, can be divided into two parts as the following,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

The over head dots represent the differentiation with respect to cosmic
time, @xmath and @xmath are the matter density and dark energy density
respectively, @xmath is the dark energy equation of state parameter. As
the dark energy and dark matter interact with themselves, they are not
conserved individually. The growth rate of one component, namely @xmath
, is the decay rate of the other. For a dimensionless representation,
@xmath has been scaled by ( @xmath ) and written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

For the @xmath CDM model, the value of @xmath is zero. In the present
work, observational constraints on the late time evolution of @xmath has
been obtained. As in the expression of the Hubble parameter (equation (
5.6 )), the first term of the right hand side, i.e. @xmath , is
considered to be the matter density scaled by the present critical
density, the interaction term @xmath can be expressed in terms of the
parameters and redshift from equation ( 5.8 ), as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

It shows that the interaction term is proportion to @xmath . Interacting
dark energy models with this type of interaction term are there in
literature xiawa where the form of interaction term is pre-assumed. But
in the present work, this type of interaction has been obtained from a
purely kinematic approach.

It deserves mention that the tacit assumption is that the dark energy
interacts with only the dark matter and not the baryons. As the baryon
density is much smaller than the dark matter density, the former is
ignored. This is important so as not to disturb the big bang
nucleosynthesis.

The second term on the right hand side of equation ( 5.6 ) is considered
to be the contribution from the dark energy density as the first term is
the only possibility for being identified to the dark matter. Thus the
expression of the dark energy equation of state parameter ( @xmath )
looks like,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

### 5.3 Results of statistical analysis

Now the remaining task is to estimate the parameter values from
observational data sets. In the present work, three different data sets
have been adopted. These are (i) the observational Hubble parameter data
(OHD), (ii) the distance modulus data of type Ia supernova (SNe) and
(iii) baryon acoustic oscillation data (BAO).

The @xmath minimization technique, which is equivalent to the maximum
likelihood analysis, has been adopted to find the best fit values of the
model parameters. Detail discussions regarding the observational data
sets and the statistical analysis is available in section 1.4 and 1.5 .

The expression of the Hubble parameter obtained for the present model
(equation ( 5.6 )) shows that the matter sector has two components. The
first one, with constant coefficient @xmath , is the dark matter density
and the other one is the dark energy density. As the energy density of
relativistic particles, mainly the photon and nutrino, have an effective
contribution to the dynamics of the of the universe at very high
redshift, an additional energy density term, evolving as @xmath for
radiation, has been taken into account in equation ( 5.6 ) while using
the angular diameter distance measurement in the analysis with BAO data.
The present value of the energy density of relativistic particles scaled
by the present critical density is taken to be @xmath with the adopted
fiducial value of current CMB temperature @xmath K. The adopted fiducial
value of @xmath is based on the measurement of current CMB temperature
@xmath K ( Fixsen2009, ) . The radiation energy density has a negligible
contribution at present epoch.

Figure 5.1 shows the confidence contours on the two dimensional (2D)
parameter space of the model for different combinations of the data sets
and figure 5.2 presents the plots of marginalized likelihoods as
functions of the model parameters. The likelihods are well fitted to
Gaussian distributions. Table 5.1 shows the results of the statistical
analysis for different combinations of the data sets. The reduced @xmath
(i.e. @xmath ) values are also presented as an estimation of the
goodness of fitting.

Both figure 5.1 and table 5.1 clearly show that the best fit value of
@xmath is very close to @xmath , indicating clearly that the model with
a constant jerk parameter is close to @xmath CDM model.

Figure 5.3 presents the plots of deceleration parameter @xmath (left
panel) and the effective or total equation of state @xmath (right panel)
where @xmath . The deceleration parameter plot clearly shows that the
reconstructed model successfully generates the recent cosmic
acceleration along with the decelerated expansion phase that prevailed
in the past. The redshift of transition from decelerated to accelerated
expansion phase obtained for the present model is 0.6 to 0.8 which is
consistent with the result of recent analysis by Farooq and Ratra
farooqratra .

Figure 5.4 presents the plots of dark energy equation of state parameter
@xmath , obtained from the analysis with different combinations of the
data sets. It is essential to note that the nature of the dark energy
equation of state, particularly the behaviour of the best fit curve is
sensitive to the choice of the data sets. The analysis combining SNe,
OHD and BAO data (right panel of figure 5.4 ) shows that the dark energy
has a slight inclination toward the non-phantom nature. The plots also
show that the @xmath is constrained better at low redshift and the
uncertainty increases at high redshift.

Figure 5.5 shows the evolution of the interaction term @xmath , defined
in equation ( 5.5 ). For the present model, any deviation from @xmath
CDM indicates a possibility of interaction between dark energy and dark
matter. For non interacting models, the interaction term @xmath is zero.
The plots of @xmath of the present model obtained from the analysis with
different combination of the data sets show that the evolution of @xmath
is also sensitive to the choice of data sets. However, for all
combinations of the data sets taken in the present work, show the
possibility of interaction between dark energy and dark matter is very
low at low redshift. But the possibility of interaction is high at high
redshift. The @xmath CDM always remains within the 1 @xmath confidence
region. The result obtained from the combination of SNe, OHD shows a
higher preference towards the interaction at high redshift (left panel
of figure 5.5 ). But the addition of BAO data brings best fit curve
closer to @xmath CDM. It is also easy to note that the present analysis
allows both positive and negative value for the interaction term @xmath
. Table 5.2 presents the present values of the interaction term obtained
from the analysis with different combination of the data sets. The
result obtained from the analysis combining SNe, OHD and BAO data shows
that the best fit curve of @xmath has an inclination towards negative
value. But the possibility of a positive @xmath is also well within the
1 @xmath confidence region. The requirement of a positive @xmath in the
context of thermodynamics has been discussed by Pavon and Wang
PavonWang2009 .

We can defined another dimensionless quantity @xmath , which is the
interaction term normalized by @xmath , as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

This @xmath actually gives a better estimate of the possibility of the
interaction. It can be written in terms of the model parameters as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

Figure 5.6 shows the plots of the @xmath . It is clear that the
uncertainty of @xmath is not vary high at high redshift compared to
uncertainty at present, thus it puts tighter constraints the possibility
of interaction also at high redshift.

### 5.4 Discussion

The present work is an attempt to search for the possibility of
interaction between the dark matter and the so-called dark energy with a
kinematic approach. The crucial factor is that we start from the
dimensionless jerk parameter @xmath which is a third order derivative of
the scale factor @xmath . This choice is of a natural interest, as the
evolution of @xmath , the second order time derivative of @xmath , is an
observational quantity now. We start from the geometrical definition of
jerk, and do not use the Einstein equations to start with. We reiterate
that the conclusion that any deviation of the jerk parameter from @xmath
indicates an interaction between dark matter and dark energy sectors is
actually based on the identification of the matter density term in
equation ( 5.6 ).

The result obtained clearly shows that the best fit value of @xmath
(chosen as a constant parameter) is very close to @xmath , which is
consistent with a @xmath CDM model. The interaction term @xmath , in a
dimensionless representation, is very close to zero at the present era.
This is completely consistent as @xmath , being a constant, does not
exchange energy with dark matter. Table 5.2 shows the best fit values of
@xmath at @xmath for various combinations of data sets. It is easily
seen that the values are two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath and
@xmath , which are approximately @xmath and @xmath respectively. All
these quantities are expressed in a dimensionless way. So this
comparison is possible.

As already mentioned, investigations regarding a reconstruction of
interaction are not too many. But the very recent work by Yang, Guo and
Cai YangGuoCai2015 is a rigorous and elaborate one. The method adopted
is the Gaussian processes. Although the work is model dependent, as the
equation of state parameter is not specified, it can be applied to a
large variety of dark energy models. The @xmath CDM model is
particularly emphasized. The basic result is the same as that of the
present work, the interaction appears to be negligible and consistent
with the @xmath CDM model at @xmath .

An intriguing feature in both the present work and that in ref
YangGuoCai2015 , is that although the best fit value still hovers around
being negligible, it is allowed to have a non-trivial value for @xmath
at higher @xmath even in the 1 @xmath confidence region. But the
interaction term normalized by the Hubble parameter (figure 5.6 ) shows
that the uncertainty at high redshift is not huge compaired to the
present epoch. So it can only be concluded that the interaction, if any,
has slightly higher possibility at high redshift. The physics of this is
not yet quite understood. As already mentioned that the interaction term
obtained in the present work is proportional to the matter density. In a
recent analysis with this type of interaction term by Xia and Wang xiawa
shows that indication towards an interacting dark energy is not
significantly strong.

Another interesting result in the present work is the fact that @xmath ,
if it has a sizeable value, it can be both positive or negative, so the
pumping of energy is possible both ways. Intuitively it might appear
that the dark energy should grow at the expense of dark matter ( @xmath
). However, the thermodynamic considerations demand that the flow of
energy should be the other way round, from dark energy to dark matter
PavonWang2009 .

It has already been mentioned that the reconstructed model mimics the
@xmath CDM for the value of cosmological jerk parameter @xmath and
prevent the possibility of interaction between dark energy and dark
matter. Any observational measurement which is based on the fiducial
assumption of a @xmath CDM cosmology, might affect the results of
statistical analysis by making the parameter values highly biased
towards the corresponding @xmath CDM values and leading to far too
optimistic error bars. Hence such kind of data, like the CMB distance
prior measurement, has not been introduced directly in the likelihood
analysis. The correlations of distance modulus measurement of type Ia
supernova have been taken into account as it might have its signature on
the results.

## Chapter 6 Reconstruction of interaction rate in holographic dark
energy

### 6.1 Introduction

In the present chapter, reconstruction of the rate of interaction
between dark energy and dark matter in a holographic dark energy has
been discussed. The basic idea of holographic dark energy is based on
fundamental thermodynamic consideration, namely the holographic
principal , introduced by ’t Hooft hooft and Susskind susskind . To
avoid the violation of the second law of thermodynamics in the context
of quantum theory of gravity, Bekenstein suggested that the maximum
entropy of the system should be proportional to its area instead of its
volume bekenstein . Form this idea, t’Hooft conjectured that the
phenomena within a volume can be explained by a set of degrees of
freedom residing on its boundary and the degrees of freedom of a system
is determined by the area of the boundary instead of the volume of the
system. In quantum field theory it relates a short distance cut-off
(ultraviolet (UV) cut-off) to a long distance cut off (infrared (IR)
cu-toff) in the limit set by the formation of a black hole cohenhol .
The total quantum zero point energy of a system should not exceed the
mass of a black hole of the same size. If @xmath be the quantum zero
point energy density with the short distance cut-off, the total energy
is @xmath , where @xmath is the size of the system. Thus it can be
written as limhol ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath . The inequality saturates for the largest allowed value of
the system size @xmath , which is the long distance cut-off or the
infrared cut-off. Thus the energy density @xmath is proportional to
inverse square of the infrared cut-off. This idea have been adopted in
the context of dark energy by Li limhol . Thus the holographic dark
energy density is written as,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a dimensionless constant. Different attempts are there
in literature with different selections of the IR cut-off length scale,
the particle horizon parhorizon , the future event horizon limhol ;
futhorizon and the Hubble horizn hubhorizon etc. Xu has studied
holographic dark energy with the Hubble horizon cut-off with constant as
well as time varying coupling parameter ( @xmath ) xuholo .
Reconstruction of interaction rate in holographic dark energy has
earlier been discussed by Sen and Pavon SenPavon2008 , where the
interaction rate has been reconstructed assuming a particular form of
the dark energy equation of state. A comparative study of the
holographic dark energy with different length scale cut-off has been
carried out by del Campo et al. campoholo . Recently Hu et al. huyholo
has attempted to build up the model combining cosmological constant and
holographic energy density. Holographic dark energy from minimal
supergravity has been discussed by Landim landimholo . Holographic dark
energy in Brans-Dicke theory has been discussed by Banerjee and Pavon
banpavholo . Stability analysis of holographic dark energy model has
been discussed by Banerjee and Roy banroyholo .

In the present chapter, the Hubble horizon has been adopted as the
infrared (IR) cut-off for the holographic dark energy meaning the
cut-off length scale @xmath , where @xmath is the Hubble parameter. The
interaction rate of holographic dark energy has been reconstructed from
three different parameterizations of the deceleration parameter. The
expressions of Hubble parameter obtained for these models hardly gives
any indication towards the independent conservation of dark matter and
dark energy. It is important to note that the holographic dark energy
model with Hubble horizon as the IR cut-off can generate late time
acceleration along with the matter dominated decelerated expansion phase
in the past only if there is some interaction between the dark energy
and dark matter. The prime endeavour of the present work is to study the
nature of interaction and the evolution of the interaction rate for
these three models assuming the holographic dark energy with Hubble
horizon as the IR cut-off.

### 6.2 Reconstruction of the interaction rate

From contracted Bianchi identity, the conservation equation of the total
energy density can be written as,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath as the dark matter is pressureless. Now the
conservation equation (equation 6.3 ) can be decomposed into two parts,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the equation of state parameter of dark energy and the
@xmath is the interaction term. If there is no interaction between dark
energy and dark matter, then the interaction term @xmath , and the
matter evolves as, @xmath .

The dark energy density @xmath for a holographic model with the Hubble
horizon as the IR cut-off (denoted as @xmath ) is given, according to
equation ( 6.2 ), as,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , the coupling parameter is assumed to be a constant in the
present work and @xmath . Now the interaction term @xmath is written as,
@xmath , where @xmath is the rate at which the energy exchange occurs
between dark energy and dark matter. The ratio of dark matter and dark
energy density, sometimes called the coincidence parameter , is written
as, @xmath , and its time derivative can be expressed as SenPavon2008 ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

For a spatially flat geometry, it can also be shown that the ratio
@xmath remains constant for a holographic dark energy with Hubble
horizon as the IR cut-off. As the ratio of dark matter and dark energy
remains constant in this case, it can potentially resolve the cosmic
coincidence problem. But it might be confusing as one may think that it
contradicts the standard scenario of structure formation during the dark
matter dominated epoch. Actually this is not the case. The matter
dominated phase is automatically recovered as the interaction rate is
very small at high and moderate redshift and thus the dark energy
equation of state resembles the non-relativistic matter hubhorizon . For
a constant value of @xmath , @xmath , from which the interaction rate
can be expressed using equation ( 6.7 ) as,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

The effective or total equation of state parameter ( @xmath ), is
related to the dark energy equation of state parameter as,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

Finally the interaction rate can be written as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

and it can be represented in a dimensionless way,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

The interaction rate has been reconstructed for three different
parameterizations of the deceleration parameter. These three
parameterizations of deceleration parameter have been discussed in the
following. It should be mentioned that for the reconstruction of the
interaction rate, it is required to fix the value of the coincident
parameter @xmath . The value of @xmath is taken according to the recent
measurement of the dark energy density parameter @xmath from Planck
using Planck+WP+highL+BAO planck2013 . For a spatially flat universe
@xmath can be written as @xmath . It is important to note that the
interaction rate @xmath does not depend upon the coupling parameter (
@xmath ). The effective equation of state parameter ( @xmath ) can be
obtained from the Hubble parameter using the Friedmann equations.

The deceleration parameter, a dimensionless representation of the second
order time derivative of the scale factor, is defined as @xmath . It can
also be written using redshift @xmath as the argument of differentiation
as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

The parametric forms of the deceleration parameter, adopted in the
present work, are given as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are the parameters for the models. However,
@xmath and @xmath do not have the same physical significance in the
three different models. The second model of deceleration parameter
adopted in the present work has already been discussed by Gong and Wang
GongWang2007 in the context of reconstruction of the late time dynamics
of the Universe. The parametrization of Model III has some similarity
with one of the parametrizations based on thermodynamic requirement
discussed by del Campo et al. campopavon . The expressions of Hubble
parameter for the models can be obtained by integrating equation ( 6.13
) to ( 6.15 ) as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -- -- --------
           (6.17)
  -- -- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

and consequently the effective equation of state parameter ( @xmath )
for the models are expressed as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

Utilizing the expression of the effective equation of state, the
interaction rate of holographic dark energy can be reconstructed using
equation ( 6.11 ). These expressions of Hubble parameter (equation (
6.16 ) to ( 6.18 )) hardly give any indication regarding the independent
conservation of dark matter and dark energy as components are not
separately identified. Another point is important to note that it is
clear from the expressions of Hubble parameter that @xmath CDM can not
be recovered as a limiting case of these models.

### 6.3 Results of statistical analysis

The values of the model parameters have been estimated by maximum
likelihood analysis. The method of parameter estimation and exhaustive
discussion about the observational data are presented in section 1.4 and
1.5 .

Figure 6.1 shows the confidence contours on the 2D parameter space of
Model I obtained from analysis with different combinations of the data
sets. Figure 6.2 shows the plots of the marginalized likelihood as
functions of the model parameters for Model I. Similarly, figure 6.3
shows the confidence contours on the 2D parameter space of Model II and
figure 6.4 shows the marginalized likelihoods of Model II. Figure 6.5
and figure 6.6 present the contour plots and marginalized likelihood
plots for Model III. It is apparent from the contour plots and the
likelihood function plots that the addition of the CMB shift parameter
data does not lead to much improvement of the constraints on the model
parameters. The likelihood functions are well fitted to Gaussian
distribution. Table 6.1 presents the results of statistical analysis of
Model I. The reduced @xmath i.e. @xmath , where the @xmath is the
degrees of freedom associated to the analysis, the best fit values of
the parameters along with the associated 1 @xmath error bars are
presented. In the similar way, table 6.2 and 6.3 present the results of
the statistical analysis of Model II and Model III respectively. Figure
6.7 shows the plots of deceleration parameter for the models obtained in
the combined analysis with OHD, SNe, BAO and CMB shift parameter data.
The plots of the interaction rate ( @xmath ) (figure 6.8 to 6.10 ) show
that the interaction was low at earlier and it increases significantly
at recent time. For Model I and Model III, the nature of constraint on
the interaction rate, obtained in the analysis combining OHD, SNe, BAO
and CMB shift data, is similar at present time and at high redshift. But
for Model II, the uncertainty increases at high redshift. The plots of
the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath also shows a very
similar behaviour for the models, (figure 6.11 to 6.13 ). It is
imperative to note that for Model I and Model II, the dark energy
equation of state parameter indicates a phantom nature at present as
@xmath at 2 @xmath confidence level and for Model III, it is slightly
inclined towards the non-phantom nature. At high redshift, the value of
@xmath be close to zero and thus allows a matter dominated epoch in the
past.

The interaction rate @xmath remains positive throughout the evolution
and increases with the expansion of the Universe. As the interaction
term @xmath is assumed to be @xmath , @xmath is also positive. This
reveals that in the interaction, the energy gets transferred from dark
energy to dark matter. It is consistent with the thermodynamic
requirement of a positive @xmath PavonWang2009 . It is important to note
that though the parametrization for Model III is significantly different
from Model I and Model II, the basic nature of the interaction rate is
same in all the case. Similar results have been obtained by Sen and
Pavon SenPavon2008 where the interaction rate of holographic dark energy
has been reconstructed from a parametrization of dark energy equation of
state parameter. Though tighter constraints have been achieved in the
present work as it is based on larger data sets, the basic nature of the
interaction rate is very similar to the results obtained in the previous
findings.

### 6.4 Bayesian evidence and model selection

The Bayesian evidence is defined as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are the parameters of the model considered. In the present
analysis, a constant prior has been assumed for the parameter values for
which the posterior is proportional to the likelihood. The evidence
calculated for these models are,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are the constant prior of Model I,
Model II and Model III respectively. The calculation of Bayesian
evidence does not give any significant information about the model
selection as the value of @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are not
significantly different. It can only be concluded that the the Model III
is marginally preferred than other two models.

### 6.5 Discussion

This chapter deals with an attempt to reconstruct the interaction rate
for holographic dark energy. The models are based on the
parameterizations of the deceleration parameter @xmath . The expressions
for the Hubble parameter, obtained for these parametrizations of the
deceleration parameter (equation ( 6.16 )-( 6.18 )), give absolutely no
clue to identify the dark matter and the dark energy components
searately and hence indicates towards an interaction between them. The
idea of the present work is to study the nature of interaction, mainly
the interaction rate, for these three cases assuming the dark energy to
be holographic with Hubble horizon as the IR cut-off. As mentioned
earlier, the holographic dark energy with Hubble horizon as the IR
cut-off requires an interaction between dark energy and dark matter to
generate the late time acceleration along with the matter dominated,
characterized by a decelerated expansion, phase that prevailed in the
past.

It has also been mentioned earlier that in a spatially flat geometry,
the ratio of dark matter and dark energy density in a holographic dark
energy model with Hubble horizon as the IR cut-off remains constant.
Thus it could be a reasonable answer to the cosmic coincidence problem.
As the dark energy equation of state parameter tends to zero at high
redshift, the dark energy behaved like dust matter in the past. Thus it
produces the matter dominated phase in the past which is consistent with
the standard models of structure formation. The interaction rate (
@xmath ) and consequently the interaction term @xmath , where @xmath ,
remain positive through the evolution for the reconstructed models. It
indicates that in the interaction, the energy gets transferred from dark
energy to dark matter which is consistent with the second law of
thermodynamics PavonWang2009 . Though the parametrizations are
different, the basic natute of interaction rate remains same in all the
cases. Similar results have also been found by Sen and Pavon
SenPavon2008 where the interaction rate has been reconstructed from
parametrization of dark energy equation of state. The dark energy
equation of state parameter shows a highly phantom nature at present for
the Model I and Model II. For Model III, however, it is inclined towards
a non-phanton nature. The plots of deceleration parameter for this
models (figure 6.7 ) show that the early decelerated expansion phase
phase is successfully recovered by these models. The value of
deceleration parameter is close to 0.5 at high redshisty which is
equivalent to the dust matter dominate phase and the transition form
decelerated to accelerated phase occurred in the redshift range 0.6 to
0.8.

The plots of interaction rate for these models (figure 6.8 to 6.10 )
show that the best fit curves for Model I and Model II behave in a very
similar way and for Model III, it is slightly different. The nature of
the associated uncertainty is different for these three models. For
Model II, the uncertainty increases at high redshift. Similar behaviour
can also be found in the dark energy equation of state parameter (
@xmath ) plots of the models (figure 6.11 to 6.13 ).

Three different combinations of the data sets have been used in the
analysis. The first one is the combination of SNe and BAO, the second
combination is of OHD, SNe and BAO. The CMB shift parameter data has
been added to it in the third combination. It is apparent that the
addition of CMB shift parameter data does not lead to much improvement
to the constraints on the model parameters. In case of the supernova
data, the systematics have also been taken into account in the
statistical analysis as the systematics might have its signature on the
results.

For a comparison of models, the Bayesian evidence calculation have been
invoked. The Bayesian evidences for the models are of the same order of
magnitude. It can only be concluded by looking at the ratio of the
Bayesian evidences of these three models, that Model III is slightly
preferred than Model I and Model II, but they are comparable to each
other in terms of model selection.

## Chapter 7 Conclusion

The present thesis contains the investigations on the reconstruction of
cosmological models. The reconstructions are mainly based on the
parametric approach where the prime endeavour is to estimate the values
of the model parameters and then to figure out the evolution of
different cosmological quantities like the Hubble parameter,
deceleration parameter, dark energy equation of state parameter etc.

The indispensable part of a reconstruction is the statistical analysis
to estimate the parameter values and the associated uncertainties.
Maximum likelihood analysis method has been adopted here to estimate the
values of the model parameters using different observational data sets.
Mainly the distance modulus data of type Ia supernova (SNe),
observational measurements of Hubble parameter (OHD), baryon acoustic
oscillation data (BAO) and CMB distance prior, namely the CMB shift
parameter (CMBShift) have been utilized. These are the most relevant
data sets for the reconstruction of late time cosmology. The models,
discussed in the present work, are well constrained in combined analysis
with these four data sets.

The reconstruction of the models, which have been discussed in the
chapters of the thesis, are based on the parametrization of various
cosmological quantities. These models can be classified into two
sections, based on the nature of conservation of the dark energy and the
dark matter. One type of models allow the dark matter and dark energy to
have independent conservation without any possibility of interaction
between them. The other type of models allows the possibility of
interaction between the dark matter and the dark energy.

The results obtained for most of the models show that the models are in
close proximity of @xmath CDM (in most of the cases the @xmath CDM
remains within 1 @xmath confidence region). Some of the models have
inclination towards the phantom nature of dark energy (i.e. @xmath ) and
in some cases, non-phantom nature is preferred. Though the results are
model dependent, it can be concluded that the dark energy equation of
state parameter hovers around the limit @xmath . At this point, it is
important to mention that though the @xmath CDM cosmology is well
consistent with most of the observational data, mainly with the
observation at very low redshift, but it might not be true for the
observations at slightly higher redshift. The recent measurement of BAO
from the flux-correlation of the Lyman-alpha (Ly @xmath ) forest of BOSS
quasars delubacohd and cross-correlation function of Ly @xmath forest
with quasars afRibera show some discrepancy with Planck @xmath CDM
cosmology. The estimation, from Ly @xmath forest BAO, of the quantity
@xmath eAubourg is at @xmath level of discrepancy with the Planck @xmath
CDM prediction of @xmath planck2015 . Though it is not clear at the
moment whether this discrepancy is due to the systematics of Ly @xmath
forest BAO, which is more complicated than the galaxy BAO data, or it
indicates towards a new physics.

Another important aspect, which has been emphasised in the present work,
is the kinematic approach to the reconstruction. The cosmological
quantities which are constructed from the scale factor and its time
derivatives, are the kinematical quantities, for example the Hubble
parameter, the deceleration parameter, the cosmological jerk parameter
etc. The kinematic approach to the reconstruction of cosmological models
is independent of any prior assumption about the gravity theory and the
nature of dark energy. Thus it is different from the standard dynamical
approach to the reconstruction of dark energy where the model is
reconstructed from the prior assumption about the dark energy equation
of state, the scalar field energy density or potential. The
reconstruction of dark energy equation of state and the reconstruction
of effective or total equation of state which have been discussed in
chapter 2 and chapter 3 respectively, belong to the dynamical approach.
On the other hand, kinematical quantities, mainly the cosmological jerk
parameter has been specially focused in some cases (in chapter 4 and
chapter 5). In chapter 4, time evolving jerk parameter models have
reconstructed. In chapter 5, possibility of interaction between dark
energy and dark matter has been investigated through the assumption of a
slowly varying jerk parameter. In both the cases, the models behave like
@xmath CDM for certain values of the model parameters.

Holographic dark energy model has also been studied (chapter 6). The
rate of interaction between dark energy and dark matter has been
reconstructed for a holographic model with Hubble horizon as the
infrared cut-off. In this context, it is important to note that the
interaction is essential for a holographic dark energy model with Hubble
horizon cut-off to generate a late time cosmic acceleration. The dark
energy equation of state parameter in this case shows a huge deviation
from the @xmath CDM scenario.

It is important to note that the models which allows the interaction
between the dark energy and dark matter, have non-zero contribution of
dark energy component in the energy budget at high redshidt. If the dark
energy component is not negligible in the pre-recombination era, then
the sound horizon ( @xmath ) is reduced be a factor @xmath , where
@xmath is the dark energy density at pre-recombination scaled by the
present critical density doramsam . Again the Hubble parameter is higher
by a factor of @xmath due to the existence of early dark energy eAubourg
. The BAO scale, namely the dilation scale (equation 1.62 ), has been
scaled by the sound horizon at photon drag epoch ( @xmath ). Thus the
factor @xmath get cancelled and the BAO scale remains insensitive to the
existence of any dark energy contribution at pre-recombination era.

The present thesis the based on reconstruction of dark energy models.
The basic idea of the reconstruction of lies in the assumption that the
dark energy equation of state parameter, energy density or the
kinematical quantities (like the deceleration parameter, cosmological
jerk parameter) must be a smooth function of time or redshfit. In case
of a parametric reconstruction, these functions are represented with
some simple functional form in terms of redshift and other model
parameters. The functional from reduces to @xmath CDM for some limit of
the model parameters and in most of the cases, the @xmath CDM value of
the model parameters remains within 1 @xmath error bar of the parameter
values estimated in the statistical analysis. But it is not possible to
judge whether a model parameter has different values at different
redshift regime, that means we can not figure out whether the parameters
itself has some evolution. If another functional form is introduced to
figure out the evolution of the parameter, then it will introduce new
parameters and the model will be penalized due to the increase in the
number of parameters. One possible way to overcome this problem is to
estimate the parameters at different redshift regime separately. But
there is no proper way to find the correlation between different
redshift bins. A non-parametric reconstruction of cosmological
quantities like deceleration parameter or equation of state parameter
nonparreconst can potentially resolve the problem, but it suffers from
the lack of data points at high redshift. As there is very less number
of data points at high redshift, the uncertainty associated to the
reconstructed parameter becomes very high at high redshift. Besides,
non-parametric reconstruction of the parameters which involves higher
order differentiation of the data (like the jerk parameter) makes the
confidence region very large and anything can hardly be concluded about
the model. So it may be possible that the @xmath CDM is favoured due to
our lack of knowledge about the time evolution.
