In this thesis we first apply the @xmath covariant description of
general relativity to analyze @xmath -fluid Friedmann-Lema√Ætre (FL)
cosmologies; that is, homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies whose
matter-energy content consists of @xmath non-interacting fluids. We are
motivated to study FL models of this type as observations suggest the
physical universe is closely described by a FL model with a matter
content consisting of radiation, dust and a cosmological constant.
Secondly, we use the @xmath covariant description to analyse scalar,
vector and tensor perturbations of FL cosmologies containing a perfect
fluid and a cosmological constant. In particular, we provide a thorough
discussion of the behaviour of perturbations in the physically
interesting cases of a dust or radiation background.
