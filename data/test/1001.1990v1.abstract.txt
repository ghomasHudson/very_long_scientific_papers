In this thesis we investigate quantum mechanical effects to various
aspects of gravitational collapse. These quantum mechanical effects are
implemented in the context of the Functional Schrödinger formalism. The
Functional Schrödinger formalism allows us to investigate the
time-dependent evolutions of the quantum mechanical effects, which is
beyond the scope of the usual methods used to investigate the quantum
mechanical corrections of gravitational collapse. Utilizing the
time-dependent nature of the Functional Schrödinger formalism, we study
the quantization of a spherically symmetric domain wall from the view
point of an asymptotic and infalling observer, in the absence of
radiation. To build a more realistic picture, we then study the
time-dependent nature of the induced radiation during the collapse using
a semi-classical approach. Using the domain wall and the induced
radiation, we then study the time-dependent evolution of the entropy of
the domain wall. Finally we make some remarks about the possible
inclusion of backreaction into the system.
