## Chapter \thechapter Introduction

### 1 Taxonomy of Gait Analysis

The simplest definition of gait states that it is the manner and style
of walking ( Whittle , 2007 ) . This can refer to any animal that can
walk whether bipedal or quadrupedal. It can be more sophisticatedly
defined as the coordinated cyclic combination of movements that result
in locomotion ( Boyd & Little , 2005 ) . This definition can be equally
applicable to any form of activity that is repetitive and coordinated so
as to cause motion of the living being originating it. Gait can vary
from walking, running, climbing and descending the stairs, swimming,
hopping and so on; all of which follows the same principle by this
definition. In the context of this thesis, the word ‘gait’ generally
refers to the ‘walking gait’ of a human.

Out of all routine activities, walking (running or jogging) is by far
the activity that makes use of most of our resources within a short span
of time. The activity includes the work of the cardiorespiratory system
( Hoekstra et al. , 2013 ) , the musculoskeletal system ( Foster &
Jandial , 2013 ) , the nervous system ( Kubo et al. , 2011 ) , the renal
system ( Kutner et al. , 2015 ) and metabolism ( Caldwell et al. , 2013
) . This level of association is why the majority of the abnormal
activities that can occur in the body reflect in the gait of the
individual experiencing it. Hence, gait analysis plays a significant
role as a clinical diagnostic. When applied in clinical practice, gait
analysis proves to be more efficient when compared to a medical
diagnosis that would otherwise be expensive and consume much more time.

The broad spectrum of research on gait analysis can be classified based
on their use or their modes of operation as illustrated in Figure 1 as a
fishbone (or Ishikawa) diagram. The application of gait analysis can be
broadly classified into four areas, namely, pathology assessment, gait
biometrics, biomechanics and behavioural analysis.

Clinical gait analysis focuses gait-related pathologies in depth. The
analyses include measures taken to assess the level of progress
associated with a particular pathology and detecting the onset of the
disease that affects gait. Pathologies that are frequently connected to
clinical gait analysis are Parkinson’s disease, cerebral palsy, stroke
and arthritis ( Kirtley , 2006 ) . A separate study addresses the fall
of the elderly ( Moniz-Pereira et al. , 2012 ) . It helps in predicting
the fall and to devise an effective treatment for the medical condition.
Further studies revolve around post-operative study on gait – one that
focuses on how surgical treatments affect gait ( Sipko et al. , 2010 ) .

The attempts on recognizing people with their gait started back at the
late 1990s ( Little & Boyd , 1998 ) . The research showed that the
nuances in the natural gait of an individual can be considered an innate
biometric that can be used to identify them. Apart from the possible
application in authentication, gait biometrics has become a topic of
serious value in forensic science. This value became of interest to the
US Defense Department at the birth of the second millennium ( McGrath ,
2003 ) .

The mass of data that can be extracted from gait can also be of
statistical relevance to provide inferences of a person’s behaviour.
Statistical gait analysis is inherently an interdisciplinary area that
can aid the other areas of application. These include the design of a
simple mobile app that can estimate units of calories burnt to
complicated emotional inference systems ( Thoresen et al. , 2012 ) .
Statistical inferences in gait can also be utilized in demographics
study which can be used to associate people into groups and study their
group behaviour that can be influenced from gait.

There are two ways in which gait features can be classified in
biomechanics – kinetic and kinematic ( Whittle , 2007 ) . The tools that
are used for the observation limit the type of features that can be
extracted. Kinetic gait analysis assesses the forces exerted and
absorbed, moment generated and accelerations involved, but without the
details that cover positional significance or orientation of objects
concerned. A good example would be a simple foot switch, it provides the
location and magnitudes concerning force but does not account the
spatial positioning of the articulation points. Kinematic gait analysis
is the converse of kinetic gait analysis. It describes the gait
parameters that involve motion, position and orientation without
considering the forces which cause the motion. The best example of a
kinematic observation tool would be the simple RGB camera.

A relatively new mode of gait analysis uses kinesiological EMG
(electromyography). An EMG is employed for recording the electrical
activity produced by the musculoskeletal system. An in-depth analysis of
gait can be done using this method. With an EMG, doctors can precisely
diagnose which muscle tendons are damaged or under-performing from an
individual’s gait. The assessment of gait through a kinesiological
electromyography (KEMG) was first lead by Inman to study both normal
individuals and amputees. According to Sutherland ( 2001 ) , the advent
of the KEMG has revolutionized clinical gait analysis from the
understanding of the knee-ankle functional link to the structure of
treatment of cerebral palsy. EMG are not adapted for biometric feature
extraction due to their invasive nature.

### 2 Historical Advents

#### 2.1 Inception of Gait Analysis

The first study on gait dates back before 300 bc by Aristotle in Greece
( Nussbaum et al. , 1985 ) which depicted the elements of movements of
animals. A more theorized version was published by the Renaissance
Italian physiologist, G. A. Borelli in 1680 ( Borelli , 1989 , English
translation by P. Maquet) . His work illustrated the notion of balance
and how it was conserved in locomotion by the movement of the feet and
the area of support which it provides. It was at that time that the
concept of contraction in muscles was put forward for the cause of
locomotion. The phases of a gait cycle was first depicted by the Weber
brothers in 1836 ( Weber & Weber , 1836 ) . The major advancements of
gait analysis over time is provided in Table 2 in chronological order.

The first kinematic analysis of gait was done by two scientists, Marey
and Muybridge in the 1870s through chronophotography. French scientist
E. J. Marey ( 1873 ) visualized the phases of gait by taking multiple
exposures of the moving subject on the same photographic plate
(translated into English in Marey , 1874 ) . His initial study involved
the motion of birds and insects. He later created the first visible
spatiotemporal imaging of gait by capturing a human subject while
walking with the prominent skeletal structure illuminated with stripes.
English photographer, Eadweard Muybridge captured chronophotographs by
using an array of 24 cameras that were made to shoot at a specified
sequence of time within a fixed period interval. He captured many
different animals in the same way (work made available at Muybridge
et al. , 1985 ) . Once such chronophotograph precisely interpreted the
gait of horses proving the fact that at a certain phase of a galloping
horse has all of its hooves off the ground. His chronophotographs of
humans were taken while doing a wide range of activities ( Muybridge ,
2007 ) .

Profound progress in the scientific study of gait was observed at the
end of the 19 ^(th) century by German anatomist Wilhelm Braune and
physiologist Otto Fischer in Der Gang des Menschen ( Braune & Fischer ,
1895 ) . Inspired by the E. J. Marey’s chronophotographs, they applied
scientific reasoning to explain the biomechanics of gait under the
effect of load and without load. The study involved measuring the
trajectories, velocities and acceleration of articulation points along
the three-dimensional space. With the knowledge of the masses of each
segment associated with the respective articulation points, they were
able to provide further inferences to the forces that are involved in
each phase of the gait cycle. Nikolai Bernstein, a neurophysiologist of
Moscow, extended the work of Braune and Fischer in the late 1930s. His
notable achievement was his work on the construction of movements in
1947 ( Bernstein , 1947 ) by applying his theory of motor control and
motor learning to discuss the role of the central nervous system (CNS)
in limb coordination and postural control. His work was later translated
into English in 1967 ( Bernstein , 1967 ) .

#### 2.2 Clinical Relevance

K. H. Vierordt ( 1881 ) conducted a study to analyse human gait
concerning the spatial pattern of footsteps. His work involves attaching
small-scale ink spray nozzles to the shoes of the subjects and make them
to walk on a moderately long surface in which the imprints of the
footsteps due to the spraying of ink can be readily analysed. The first
force plate reported was used by Jules Amar in 1924 as a tool to help
diagnose rehabilitation of patients who were injured during the First
World War ( Baker , 2007 ) . The apparatus includes the use of pneumatic
three-component force plates. Its application was of clinical relevance
but was not scientifically validated for its accuracy. The first
successful force platform was introduced by Elftman ( 1938 ) . It
consisted of a set of springs attached to force plates spread across the
stepping region. The force is measured optically using a high frame-rate
camera from the vertical up and down movement of the force plates
measuring both point of force as well as its magnitude. This apparatus
succeeded his previous experimental setup proposed in 1934 ( Elftman ,
1934 ) which only gave the point of application of the force but not the
magnitude. All these early force plate designs were purely mechanical in
their operation.

Much of the advancements in modern gait analysis were reported from
California. This includes the detailed mechanical analysis of gait from
the hip, knee and ankle joints by Bresler & Frankel ( 1950 ) . Most were
specifically from the Biomechanics Laboratory founded by V. T. Inman and
H. D. Eberhart during the 1940s to 1960s ( Kirtley , 2013a ) . Once such
significant research includes the mechanisms in which the body conserves
energy during gait ( Saunders et al. , 1953 ) . The first computerized
video analysis of gait was done in the 1970’s by David H. Sutherland who
was mentored by Inman ( Sutherland , 2002 ) . He reinvented the art of
EMG to be used for analysing gait. D. H. Sutherland was known to be the
founder father of clinical gait analysis ( Kaufman & Chambers , 2006 ) .
The widely accepted definitive guide for normal gait was published by
Inman et al. ( 1981 ) .

The history of researchers who shaped gait analysis before World War II
is detailed in Kirtley ( 2013b ) , after its period in Kirtley ( 2013a )
and the modern era in Kirtley ( 2013c ) . Richard Baker ( 2007 )
provided a detailed account on the history of gait analysis focusing on
the period before the application of computerized observation.

#### 2.3 Interest in Biometrics

Murray et al. ( 1964 ) concluded that gait could pose a behavioural
property which is unique to any human individual provided that all
possible gait parameters are taken into account. Despite this statement,
gait biometric research has proved that a subset of the vast features of
gait is sufficient to produce a system that yields a performance of
practical relevance.

Gait can be used as a non-obtrusive form of biometric ( Boyd & Little ,
2005 ) . This unique trait sets it apart from the other modalities. The
other established forms of biometrics include face, fingerprint,
handwritten signature and iris; all of which requires a closer
observation of the subject to process the images at a sufficiently high
resolution. However, gait can be observed from a person even from a
lower resolution surveillance camera with minimal level of cooperation
from the subject who is to be identified.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) launched the Human
Identification at a Distance (HumanID) programme in the year 2000 (ended
in 2004). This research programme focused on human identification
through the face, gait and the application of new technologies. The
intention of the programme was to use the state of the art unobtrusive
distance biometric techniques on real world data. Gait-based recognition
played a significant role in here. Major institutions which took part in
this programme were Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Carnegie
Mellon University, University of South Florida (USF), University of
Maryland, Georgia Institute of Technology, and the University of
Southampton ( Nixon et al. , 2010 ) . The datasets compiled by most of
these institutions are publicly available. Section 10 discusses more on
those datasets.

### 3 Nomenclature

The knowledge of the technical terms associated with the study of gait
analysis is required for a deeper understanding in gait research. The
stages of the human (normal) gait cycle are illustrated in Figure 2 .

#### 3.1 Phases of Gait

Gait phases and positions vary between two terminologies: the
traditional terms and the standard of Rancho Los Amigos set by J. Perry
& Burnfield ( 1992 ) to handle both normal and pathological gait.
Although both of which are used interchangeably, the knowledge of both
system of terms is required to comprehend the literature. A standard
human gait cycle consists of eight key positions, with the initial
contact added twice to make the cycle complete. Note that the sequence
of positions is accounted only for one foot. Hence, a complete gait
cycle or a stride is the activity that concerns a sequence of events
between two consecutive heel strikes (or heelstrikes) of the same foot.
Whereas the activity that occurs from one foot’s heel strike to the
other is called a step. The time it takes for completing a stride is
called cycle time. In a normal gait, the gait cycle of one foot is
displaced from that of the other foot by a fixed phase shift.

The periods between consecutive gait positions are called the phases of
the gait cycle. The load response phase depicts the response made by the
body to absorb the impact of heelstrike by flexing the knee, contracting
the quadriceps. In the mid-stance, the knee extends, and the associated
foot is kept flat on the ground, i.e., both toe and heel are maintained
in ground contact. During the terminal stance, the legs extend further
while keeping its contact with the ground to advance the body forward.
The legs then start to flex again to get ready to swing at the pre-swing
phase. Then, at the initial swing, the foot accelerates to provide a
forward momentum and controls its speed at midswing. The foot
decelerates to reach its position, the next initial contact.

The period in which the foot is on the ground is called the stance
phase, and it composes 60-62% of the gait cycle ( Kirtley , 2006 ) . The
remaining period, when the foot is off the ground, is called the swing
phase. The proportions, however, differ depending on the individual and
the speed of the walk. The stance phase encompasses the first four
phases of the gait cycle from initial contact to toe off. The swing
phases cover the phases between the toe off and the successive initial
contact. The stance and swing phases alternate to produce a locomotion.
While one foot is in swing phase, the other would be on stance phase for
balance.

#### 3.2 Gait Parameters

Most of the following terminology is taken concerning the ones
prescribed by Whittle ( 2007 ) .

     [topsep=0pt]

  Cycle time  

     is the time taken to complete a single gait cycle. It is also known
    as a gait period.

  Double support  

     is the interval in which both feet are in contact with the ground
    when the stance phase of both legs overlap.

  Step length  

     is the length covered between initial contact of one foot to that
    of the other feet.

  Stride-length  

     is the distance displaced by the foot during its stride (one
    complete gait cycle); consists of two step lengths.

  Cadence  

     is the number of steps taken in a given time usually measured in
    steps per minute

  Walking base  

     is the perpendicular distance defined by the space between the
    track of both feet.

  Walking speed  

     is usually measured in metres per second, but can also be measured
    in statures (height) per second in clinical practice.

The double support period would define the difference between walking
and running. As long this period is positive, the person is walking, and
her/his speed is inversely proportional to the magnitude of this
interval; otherwise, the person is considered to be running (or
jogging). The double support period is an important measure during a
walking race (or race walking) where a negative double support time
would indicate that the candidate is running instead of walking.

The stride length of both feet is the same regardless of the effect of
the pathology. However, the step lengths commonly differ for a
pathological gait due to differing stance and swing phase proportions
between the left and right leg. For instance, a pathologically affected
leg would tend to spend lesser stance time leading to a lesser swing in
the other leg. Hence, a shorter step length on one side would infer
antalgic conditions on the other side.

#### 3.3 Reference Planes

Gait is usually observed in one of three planes of reference: sagittal,
transverse, or frontal. A clear depiction of the reference planes is as
provided in Figure 3 . The sagittal plane divides the body into right
and left proportions. Most gait research in literature is based on the
sagittal angle as it is perceived to be the simplest angle to obtain the
salient features. When observed at a sagittal angle, the walking subject
tends to move from left to right or vice versa, i.e., the person is said
to walk frontoparallel to the viewpoint. Along the frontal or coronal
plane, where the body is divided into front and back halves, a walking
subject moving forward in motion is perceived to move towards the
observer. The transverse or horizontal plane divides the body into upper
and lower halves. There is not much literature that analyses gait in
this angle due to the difficulty of extracting information from it.

Three pairs of rotatory motion are required for the body to make any
means of movement: internal and external rotations, abduction and
adduction, extension and flexion. They are illustrated in Figure 4 . In
general, flexion and extension occur in the sagittal plane, adduction
and abduction take place in the frontal plane, and other rotatory
motions occur in the transverse plane. Note that in Figure 4 , the
internal and external rotation shown is performed by the knee and the
thighs, not by the ankle. If done at the ankle, the similar result is
said to be caused by the forefoot’s adduction/abduction. Flexion at the
ankle is known as dorsiflexion whereas its extension is known as
plantarflexion.

#### 3.4 Performance Metrics

The following terms are used when evaluating the performance of
biometric systems.

     [topsep=0pt]

  FRR  

     (False Reject Rate) is the rate at which an authentic subject is
    rejected by the system under observation.

  FAR  

     (False Accept Rate) is the rate at which an impostor/intruder is
    accepted as an authentic subject by the system under observation.

  AER  

     (Average Error Rate) is the average of FRR and FAR,
    i.e, @xmath .

  EER  

     (Equal Error Rate) is a measure specific for threshold-based
    authentication systems. At a certain threshold, both FRR and FAR
    becomes equal; this error rate is termed as the EER.

  Rank  

     is a measure specific to distance-based identification systems.

### 4 Research Directions

Gait analysis is an interesting study and is proven to be applicable for
diverse domains of applications. There are many open areas of research
from which one can choose in the field. They can be segregated into two
groups – active areas and those that are least explored.

#### 4.1 Active Areas

-    [leftmargin=*]

-    Reliable recognition independent of clothing style. Several
    algorithms have been outlined to combat this problem (e.g., Yu
    et al. , 2006 ; Yogarajah et al. , 2015 ) and a handful of datasets
    to help with this regard (CASIA-B, OU-ISIR-B, TUM-GAID, and so on).
    However, state of the art gait biometrics algorithms do suffer a
    significant depreciation when the clothing style changes.

-    A comparative study of gait pathologies. Various papers are
    published classifying diseases concerning their nuances in gait
    (e.g., Kohle et al. , 1997 ; Zeng & Wang , 2015 ; Geroin et al. ,
    2015 ) . The clinical attention to this segment is growing as there
    are still so many gait-related pathologies that are still not
    compared as of yet.

-    Gait recognition at different walking speed. With datasets like
    CASIA-C and OU-ISIR-A, gait recognition at different speeds is
    becoming more of interest ( Tanawongsuwan & Bobick , 2003b ;
    Iwashita et al. , 2015 ; Tanawongsuwan & Bobick , 2003a ) . There
    are, however, further improvements that can be made.

-    Correlation between walking and running gait. When an individual
    switches from walking to running, the double support time turns
    negative while the arm swing increases. To achieve balance in this
    state, the body makes many modifications to the posture.

-    View-independent gait recognition. Numerous studies that propose
    recognition models that could cope with multiple views. Steady
    progress is still being made in this area.

-    A comparative study between model-based and model-free recognition
    methods. Though studies contrast on the merits and demerits of both
    approaches, there is still space for an in-depth comparative
    analysis.

-    Unbiased comparison of state of the art gait recognition. The
    methods in literature show conflicting results of correct
    classification rates when performances of established algorithms are
    compared, even with the same dataset. The existing algorithms are to
    be compared with standard datasets without bias.

#### 4.2 Least Explored

-    [leftmargin=*]

-    Correlation between kinetic and kinematic features. Studies show
    how kinetic and kinematic features can be assessed together (
    Schepers , 2009 ) . Some utilize both for gait assessment ( Viton
    et al. , 1998 ; Tao et al. , 2012 ; Zeni et al. , 2008 ) . However,
    relationship between kinetic and kinematic features of gait is still
    blurred.

-    Characteristic differences in gait based on ethnicity. People from
    different regions do have a characteristic gait. CASIA datasets are
    composed of Chinese individuals, while the USF gait dataset are
    largely American. More datasets are to be created across various
    ethnicity to study the associated differences between them in terms
    of their gait.

-    Ranking of factors that inhibit gait. The confounding factors of
    gait are as listed in Section 9.5 . Though known, they are not
    compared in a way that would determine to which extent they inhibit
    gait. For instance, to what instance could training affect biometric
    gait? This has been an open question to which no reports are
    currently available.

-    Different machine learning methods for gait recognition. The
    novelty of the recognition algorithms lies on the technique in which
    features are extracted. Commonly used classifiers are Artificial
    Neural Networks (ANN), @xmath -Nearest Neighbours ( @xmath NN), and
    Support Vector Machine (SVM). A detailed analysis on how different
    classifiers effect the prediction rate through state of the art gait
    feature extraction algorithms is yet to be reported.

-    Stratification of gait patterns. People can be grouped by means of
    their gait. This grouping can reveal certain insights to the
    behaviour or traits that members of the same group share. In theory,
    we could find some means to cluster and associate them to different
    strata.

-    Gait in demographics. Deeper statistical inferences can be drawn
    from gait within social groups. That is, the similarities of gait
    can be assessed within a demographic group, and differences can be
    studied across the groups in terms of gait. This is the converse of
    stratification wherein people are grouped based on their gait
    similarities.

-    More statistical gait analysis. There are limited amount of studies
    reported in this area. Gait has been statistically analysed
    extensively for assessing pathology and studying gait biometrics.
    However, there is untapped potential lying within the broader
    statistical analysis of gait.

### 5 Contributions

Four gait-based biometric assessment methods are proposed in this study:
a gender classification algorithm, a gait recognition method, and two
authentication paradigms.

Existing methods for gait-based gender classification extract
spatiotemporal relationship between the frames of a gait sequence to
make a single prediction on the subject’s gender. The method proposed in
this thesis, however, makes a prediction for every pose assumed by the
subject during gait. The prediction of the gait instance itself is taken
through a majority vote. Two sets of features are explored for this
purpose, viz., EFD and RCS.

Gait recognition (or identification) is the process of identifying a
person from her/his gait alone. Not all features extracted from gait may
correlate with the identity of the subject, especially in the case of
covariate factors that affect a person’s walking style. Though gait
recognition is well-developed in literature, the algorithm proposed in
this thesis optimizes the efficiency of template-based recognition
systems. The resulting template would include only features that are
least affected by the covariate factors.

Gait authentication (or verification) is a process in which the system
ascertains whether the subject is whom she/he claims to be based only on
the gait observed. The literature available for this topic is limited as
most adopt the features that are used in identification for
authentication as well while defining closeness to the claimed identity
through a Euclidean threshold. Two completely new paradigms proposed in
this thesis greatly reduce the average error rates of gait
authentication systems.

This study will also attempt to answer the following research questions.

1.   Can gender classification be improved to cope with occlusions?

2.   Can chain encoding help with gait-based gender classification?

3.   How to optimize feature selection for video-based gait recognition?

4.   How to enhance the performance of gait authentication systems?

5.   Is the sagittal angle really the best angle for gait biometrics?

### 6 Organization of the Thesis

The rest of the thesis is organized as follows. Chapter 2 details the
relevant literature in the field of gait biometrics. The research
contributions are presented in chapters 3 through 6. These chapters
elucidate the state of the art and highlights their limitations followed
by methods proposed to overcome them. Algorithms that are included are
experimentally verified through established benchmark procedures and
quantitatively compared with the existing methods.

     [topsep=0pt, leftmargin=2em]

  Chapter 2:  

     Provides a brief interpretation of the literature closely
    associated with the research work along with the description of the
    available datasets for the evaluation of gait biometrics.

  Chapter 3:  

     This chapter focuses on the most popular soft biometric aspect of
    gait biometrics – gender classification. Though the existing method
    produces close to perfect identification, the proposed method,
    pose-based voting , allows for better recognition even in partially
    occluded gait sequences.

  Chapter 4:  

     Gait recognition makes up for a major share in gait literature.
    This chapter presents the genetic template segmentation technique
    for gait recognition.

  Chapter 5:  

     This chapter presents an innovative framework called multiperson
    signature matching to outperform the existing threshold-based gait
    authentication framework. This scalable method improves its
    performance in proportion to the system population.

  Chapter 6:  

     When the system population is considerably low the effectiveness of
    the method proposed in chapter 5 is suppressed. To overcome its
    limitation, this chapter presents a novel framework using the
    multivariate Gaussian Bayes posterior probability.

  Chapter 7:  

     This chapter concludes the findings of the thesis and presents the
    work planned for the future.

## Chapter \thechapter Literature Survey

Gait analysis is composed of three components, viz., kinematics,
kinetics, and electromyographic data ( Gage et al. , 1995 ) . Each of
these components can be separately analysed and studied. There is a
large variety of gait analysis tools that are commercially available as
shown in Table 3 . A detailed account of the different ways to measure
gait analysis is provided by Clayton & Schamhardt ( 2001 ) .

### 7 Approaches for Gait Biometrics

The biometric features of gait can be extracted through a variety of
ways. According to Gafurov ( 2007 ) , the approaches for gait biometrics
can be classified into three types, viz., wearable sensor-based, floor
sensor-based and machine vision-based methods. Research over the past
decade has vastly developed the field of gait biometrics since then. The
methods can be grouped by the tools employed for feature extraction as
follows:

1.   Inertial sensors

2.   Footstep analysis

3.   Acoustic data

4.   WiFi signals

5.   2D and 3D camera (computer vision)

Each of these tools has its pros and cons that are assessed and
addressed in ongoing research.

#### 7.1 Inertial Sensors

An inertial sensor is a device used to measure the motion of the
attached subject based on inertia. The ones used for gait analysis are
usually capable of measuring motion across three dimensions (triaxial).
They can be either worn or carried by the person who is to be
identified. When wearable sensors are used, especially when the system
consists of multiple devices, there might be a problem of inconsistent
sensor attachment ( Förster et al. , 2009 ) . Sensor placement during
testing phase should be the same as in the training phase. Inconsistent
attachment can introduce an additional error factor to the biometric
system. There is also a greater problem sensor orientation ( Ngo et al.
, 2015 ) which can completely change the pattern of readings observed in
the three-dimensional space.

An accelerometer is used to measure the acceleration exerted along a
given direction. A triaxial accelerometer would give readings for
accelerations along all three spatial axes. They are by far the most
common form of kinematic gait measuring equipment as they are the least
expensive of the alternatives and the easiest to calibrate and process.
The frequency response of an accelerometer shows the maximum deviation
of its sensitivity ( Wilcoxon Research , 2008 ) . The triaxial
accelerometer is the most common form of inertial sensor applied for
gait recognition.

The largest inertial sensor database till date was presented by Ngo
et al. ( 2014 ) . It consists of sensor data from 744 subjects. Each
subject wore a gait capture belt around the waist. The belt was fitted
with three triaxial accelerometer-gyroscope couple and a smartphone. The
triaxial accelerometer in the smartphone was also considered for the
data collection. Rong et al. ( 2007 ) and Derawi et al. ( 2010 ) both
report an EER of 14.3% using this dataset.

The main challenge to mobile phone-based gait authentication approaches
is that the subject should bear the phone in a specific location –
usually the trouser pocket for the most successful operation. So this
constraint refrains the user from using any other attire that does not
include a pocket. Other locations for inertial sensor placement include
hip, back of the waist, arm, and ankle. A detailed account of gait
verification through wearable sensors was given by Nickel ( 2012 ) and
Sprager & Juric ( 2015 ) .

#### 7.2 Footstep Analysis

A person’s footstep can be analysed either by a wearable sensor, like a
footswitch, or by a floor mounted sensor like a force platform. A
footswitch measures the pressure applied by the foot on the ground. It
can extract temporal data from swing-phase and stance-phase, and cadence
and velocity. However, it is unable to provide spatial data such as
step/stride length. The early form of footswitches used for gait
analysis was designed through a conductive material placed on the inner
soles of a pair of shoes ( Minns , 1982 ) . The current technology
allows more efficient sensors to be embedded in the soles of the shoe
such as advanced force-sensing resistors (FSR). A simple way to
implement this design is as shown in Figure 5 . It works on the
principle that when force is applied to a conductive polymer surface,
the resistance across varies inversely to the force applied – a method
patented by F. N. Eventoff ( 1984 ) .

S. J. Morris ( 2004 ) designed an apparatus that combines both the
footswitch and inertial sensors and later developed it ( Morris Bamberg
et al. , 2008 ) . It includes FSR sensors along with accelerometers and
gyroscopes to a shoe thus forming a ‘GaitShoe’. This apparatus was used
to assess heel strike and toe off as well as to approximate foot
orientation and position. Although the footswitch is useful in clinical
gait analysis, the practical relevance of this device is still
questionable from a biometric perspective.

To enable gait authentication in closed spaces and further avoiding the
privacy concerns of visual surveillance systems, floor mounted systems
became an option to extract gait biometric features ( Mason et al. ,
2016 ) . These instruments allow the ground reaction force (GRF) to be
measured directly from the floor on which the individual walks. The
terms force plate and force platforms are used interchangeably since a
platform can be assembled through multiple force plates, but in this
context, they are described as two different instruments. A force plate
is a metal plate coated with a non-slip substance beneath which
transducers are attached that converts pressure to electrical signals
which can be amplified and processed ( Clayton & Schamhardt , 2001 ) . A
force platform is the same in definition but can be extended to a larger
surface which can facilitate efficient tracking of the foot placement
during gait such as a walkway, e.g., GAITRite ( CIR Systems, Inc. , 2017
) .

A detailed review of footstep recognition is given by Rodriguez et al. (
2009 ) . Recently, Mason et al. ( 2016 ) conducted detailed experiments
on the biometric performance of the GRF using various machine learning
algorithms. They show that the EER can be reduced to below 5% using the
GRF data alone. The literature in footstep analysis is not as vast as in
computer vision-based and inertial sensor-based techniques. The main
reason is due to the lack of a publicly available dataset. Force
platforms are expensive instruments and are difficult to install,
maintain and analyse. It would be one of the most expensive gait
biometric assessment tools explained in this section.

#### 7.3 Acoustic Data

The biometric features that can be extracted through footsteps can also
be derived from the sound generated by them. The temporal analysis of
the acoustic response of footsteps can be a highly unobtrusive gait
biometric. The use of acoustic footstep analysis for gait identification
is relatively new in literature. The sounds that can be heard from the
same individual can vary across different footwear and surfaces. The
challenge of acoustic gait recognition is the extraction of features
that are invariant to these conditions. Shoji et al. ( 2004 ) attempted
to overcome this issue through mel-cepstrum analysis. This system was
succeeded by Itai & Yasukawa ( 2006 ) using psycho-acoustics parameters,
viz., loudness, fluctuation strength, sharpness, and roughness.

The apparatus of Bland ( 2006 ) consists of three microphones to hear
the sound and three sensitive accelerometers as seismic sensors in the
vicinity in which the subjects are to be identified. The sound that is
generated from the footsteps is composed of a mixture of waves of both
audible and inaudible frequencies. The components from the higher
frequency bands are first converted to the audible range before the
application of predictive modelling. Kalgaonkar & Raj ( 2007 ) used the
acoustic Doppler sensors as an inexpensive alternative to the customized
apparatus. Itai & Yasukawa ( 2008 ) approached the acoustic gait
recognition problem in a similar way to speech recognition through
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Anguera Jordà ( 2012 ) applied acoustic gait
analysis for person identification, gender classification and shoe-type
identification where SVM was the classifier used for the prediction.
Geiger et al. ( 2014 ) used only the audio data from the TUM-GAID
dataset ( Hofmann et al. , 2014 ) with Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for
prediction.

#### 7.4 WiFi Signals

Groundbreaking research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
resulted in a novel technique to track gait using only WiFi signals.
Fadel Abib and Dina Katabi first proposed a system called Wi-Vi – WiFi
Vision – to detect and locate (to a degree) objects in motion through
walls ( Adib & Katabi , 2013 ) . The system was also able to recognize
primitive gestures. All it requires is a WiFi transmitter and two or
more receivers; it requires no wearables or attachable items for its
functioning. It can approximate the location of moving subjects behind
concrete walls, hollow walls and wooden doors by computing the Doppler
shift and spatial angle of reception. It uses a process called nulling
to eliminate static objects from detection.

Katabi’s research group generalized this concept for 3D tracking of
humans ( Adib et al. , 2014 ) . Their new system, WiTrack, is a wireless
device that can track a person within a 3D space which even works
through occlusion and not limited to line-of-sight. Body parts can be
coarsely tracked more efficiently than Wi-Vi but not so in detail, yet
its accuracy was claimed to exceed that of RF localization systems at
its time. WiTrack was more of an intermediate between RF-based
localization systems and human-computer interaction systems like Kinect.
It uses a single transmitter and three receivers to triangulate the
motion of the subject. WiTrack is tuned only to pick out objects in
motion and neutralize signals associated with static objects through
subsequent reception cancellation. This process is termed to be
background subtraction. The tracking is not disrupted by small moving
objects. It is supposedly the first 3D tracking device with an error
within the order of centimetres; median of deviation along @xmath is
@xmath . While the first design ( Adib et al. , 2014 ) was only intended
to track one human at a time, it was developed further ( Adib et al. ,
2014 ) for multi-person localization. Recent developments of WiFi-based
gait recognition includes WiWho by Zeng et al. ( 2016 ) and WiFi-ID by
Zhang et al. ( 2016 ) .

#### 7.5 Computer Vision

Computer vision is by far the oldest and the most researched approach
for gait biometrics. While MoCap systems are used extensively in
clinical aspect, methods that require just regular 2D video can be
easily employed in legacy surveillance systems. The rest of the methods
discussed in this thesis employ only computer vision.

##### MoCap Systems

Motion capture (MoCap) provides the most accurate technique to measure
gait analysis. This approach consists of attaching reflective markers to
strategic locations on the subject’s body. Special cameras emit infrared
(IR) strobe lights which reflect off the markers and back into the video
camera. The camera can then pick up point-light motion of the reflectors
that are visible from its viewpoint. An array of cameras (mostly eight)
is positioned around the subject so that by computing on the inputs of
the cameras combined, a three-dimensional depiction of the subject can
be visualized.

A simplified schematic of a typical MoCap system is as shown in Figure 6
. They are of great value in clinical practice as they provide precise
analysis required for treating gait related pathologies ( Mulroy et al.
, 2003 ; Yuan et al. , 2006 ; Meyns et al. , 2012 ) .

##### RGB Camera

A typical MoCap system can be very expensive and complex to set up.
Two-dimensional RGB cameras, on the other hand, are cheap to obtain and
do not require a complicated setup process as associated with MoCap
systems. Since they lack the expressiveness of a fully functional MoCap
system, their application for clinical use is limited. Nevertheless, due
to their unobtrusive and pervasive nature, they find their application
extensively in gait identification.

Vasconcelos & Tavares ( 2015 ) proposed a method to extract the
articulation points from a human gait from a single RGB camera. These
points together formed a point distribution model (PDM) ( Cootes et al.
, 1992 ) which would hence be helpful for a model-based processing of
human motion during gait. 100 contour points were approximated using the
silhouette border, and 13 articulation points were labelled on the image
manually. This labelling would facilitate the construction of an Active
Shape Model (ASM) ( Cootes et al. , 1995 ) . The ASM would combine the
PDM shape model along with the grey information of associated points to
be able to generalize to new images in the dataset. The CASIA-B was used
for experimentation. By training the ASM using only 14 subjects along
four directions, the system was able to approximate the landmark points
to unseen images in the dataset.

##### Microsoft Kinect

The main components of the Kinect is an IR projector, an RGB camera, and
an IR camera. Details of its function can be found in Zhang ( 2012 ) .
The concept behind depth perception involves the analysis of structured
light, a patented technique by PrimseSense ( Freedman et al. , 2014 ) .
The infrared projector projects a structured image called a speckle
pattern. Objects in range reflect back the speckle pattern. When this
pattern is viewed away from the angle of projection, parallax occurs.
The parallax would aid the IR camera in depicting the distance of the
objects in view from the device. By combining the image feed from the
RGB camera, depth information inferred from the IR camera and machine
learning the Kinect can produce 3D model of the object it sees. It is
much less expensive than a MoCap system and is more flexible than a
simple RGB camera. Several techniques are proposed to extract gait
features from a Kinect camera ( Nakajima et al. , 2013 ; Mentiplay
et al. , 2015 ; Xu et al. , 2015 ) . It is much more effective in
gait-based recognition ( Chattopadhyay et al. , 2015 ; Kastaniotis
et al. , 2015 ) , and it can even be utilized for clinical gait analysis
( Nocent et al. , 2013 ) .

### 8 Soft Biometrics

Soft biometrics are characteristic that can apply to a certain group of
individuals. Some of the prominent human soft biometrics include
ethnicity, gender, age, height, weight, eye colour, scars and marks, and
voice accent ( Nandakumar & Jain , 2009 ) . These properties are
considered ‘soft’ because they do not distinguish an individual from all
others. For instance, there can be more than one person who possesses a
given height and weight, and it is possible to mimic the accent of
another person. Out of the above, the first four can be identified
through gait alone. Prominent research on soft biometrics focus on age
estimation and gender classification ( Hu et al. , 2011 ) .

#### 8.1 Age Estimation

For an average human, the muscle fibres and muscle coordination
deteriorate in the later stages of his/her life. This process affects
the gait of the aged human. The probable gait-related symptoms that can
be exhibited at the elderly stage are the loss of stability, momentary
imbalance, and tendency to fall ( Senden et al. , 2014 ) . The degree to
which any of these symptoms occur can differ from one person to another
but are indicators of old age nonetheless. A person’s gait can also be
an indicator of the level of maturity. One can easily tell the gait of
an adolescent from that of an adult even when height is not a factor.

Lu & Tan ( 2010 ) studied the difference in the age-related biometric
component of gait across both genders using a subset of the USF dataset
consisting of 79 subjects with ages ranging from 19 to 59 years. GEI (
Han & Bhanu , 2006 ) was adopted for feature extraction ¹ ¹ 1 The GEI is
explained in detail in Section 9.2 and multi-label guided subspace was
applied to reduce the dimensions while the @xmath -Nearest Neighbour (
@xmath NN) algorithm was used for the classification. The age
information was encoded as a sequence of 8 binary labels, one of which
was also the gender. One @xmath NN was trained for each of the labels in
the sequence. The label sequence was decoded to obtain the estimation of
the age of the subject. The mean absolute error was reported to be
approximately 5.6 years.

Makihara et al. ( 2011 ) conducted a much more extensive experimentation
for age estimation wherein the gait instances from 1728 subjects with
the ages between 2 to 94 years were recorded. The Gaussian Process
Regression was considered to be a highly efficient face-based age
estimation algorithm ( Rasmussen & Williams , 2006 ) and it was adopted
by Makihara et al. ( 2011 ) for gait-based age estimation. They have
concluded that the performance of frequency domain features and the GEI
features are equal with a mean absolute error of 8.2 years.

#### 8.2 Gender Classification

Gender is found to be the most popular soft biometric that can be
derived from human gait. The first major work on gait-based gender
recognition was done by Huang & Wang ( 2007 ) . The silhouette of each
frame in the gait cycle was segmented up into seven regions, and an
ellipse was fit to each of them. The geometric parameters of the
ellipses collectively become the feature set of the gait instance. The
similarity measures between male and female instances were trained using
an SVM classifier to form the recognition system. A similar method of
segmenting was suggested by Li et al. ( 2008 ) . Only this time, the GEI
of the gait instance was segmented instead of the individual
silhouettes. The GEI template was split into 6 regions whose boundaries
were obtained from the analysis of the training instances. A simple
pixel-wise similarity measure was adopted to form the feature space
which was reduced through independent component analysis (ICA) and
classified through SVM. Yu et al. ( 2009 ) also split the GEI to
multiple components based on body parts. Additionally, they assigned
weights to each region which was then fed to SVM for classification. The
weights signify the effectiveness of gender discriminability to the
respective component.

Hu et al. ( 2011 ) adopted an entirely different method for
spatiotemporal feature extraction to compiling gait templates such as
the GEI. The process involves extracting shape features from multiscale
grids. Their method reports the best performance till date. As the
previous methods were constrained in terms of the angle of view (mostly
at the sagittal angle), Lu et al. ( 2014 ) have designed a method that
is said to work in arbitrary view angles. They propose the cluster-based
averaged gait image (C-AGI) as an alternative to the GEI to cope with
multiple walking directions. Sparse representation metric learning and
classification ( Wright et al. , 2009 ) was used for gender prediction.

Apart from the studies conducted with standard video cameras, there were
also research done with three-dimensional data in connection with gender
identification from gait. Igual et al. ( 2013 ) ; Kastaniotis et al. (
2013 ) used Microsoft Kinect ( Zhang , 2012 ) to get depth information
along with the RGB visual information. As the data obtained was
computationally large, both required the use of extensive feature
reduction before classifying with SVM. Flora et al. ( 2015 ) claim to
improve the recognition accuracy with the help of motion capture
information. The work in this thesis focuses on the data obtained from
traditional cameras as it is possible to obtain optimal classification
rates without the use of depth information. Furthermore, algorithms
designed for conventional two-dimensional cameras have a much greater
scope as they can be readily augmented with legacy surveillance
framework with minimal modification.

### 9 Hard Biometrics

Gait is characteristic to one’s individuality it is considered to be an
accepted form of unobtrusive biometrics ( Boyd & Little , 2005 ) .
Hence, in theory, it does not require the cooperation or the awareness
of the individual being observed. Some researchers still argue that gait
itself as a soft biometric characteristic ( Li et al. , 2017 ; Arora
et al. , 2015 ) , most researchers today have proven that a gait
signature can be established as a hard biometric. A simplified template
for a gait recognition system is as shown in Figure 7 . A gait sequence
is a temporal record of a person’s gait. These are usually translated
into a features database after some means of preprocessing and feature
extraction. When the test gait sequence is given for identification, the
system refers the gait feature database and returns the closest match
(if any) according to some criteria.

The approaches for gait recognition can be broadly classified into two
types: model-based and model-free. Due to its simplicity and efficiency
in use, model-free methods are more prevalent. Model-free techniques can
be further categorized as template-based and non-template methods.

Many benchmark datasets are available to compare the performance of one
algorithm with another. Recent literature commonly use the USF Gait
Challenge dataset and CASIA-B. The aforementioned and the remaining
available datasets for gait biometrics will be detailed in Section 10 .

The recognition process involves the use of an established machine
learning algorithm such as the HMM (used in Liu & Sarkar ( 2007 ) ; Kale
et al. ( 2002 ) ; Liu & Sarkar ( 2006 ) ; Zhang et al. ( 2007 ) ; Nguyen
et al. ( 2014 ) ). Some apply different techniques such as canonical
analysis ( Huang et al. , 1999 ; Foster et al. , 2003 ) , spatiotemporal
correlation ( Murase & Sakai , 1996 ) , and DTW ( Tanawongsuwan & Bobick
, 2001 ; Lam et al. , 2011 ; Choudhury & Tjahjadi , 2013 ) . A few
others devise newer techniques for closeness representation. All others
employ the nearest neighbour classifier (recent examples: Xing et al. ,
2015 ; Arora et al. , 2015 ) .

#### 9.1 Model-free Techniques and Early Approaches

The vast majority of model-free techniques tend to have a strong
reliance on spatiotemporal analysis of silhouettes of the individual
during gait. A spatiotemporal analysis takes into account the variation
in the spatial domain with respect to that in the time domain. So when
this is applied to gait recognition, the analyses involves the
observation of the spatial locations of body parts and their movement in
different stages in time.

Almost all model-free methods have background subtraction and silhouette
extraction as the first step. Background subtraction is a simple method
in which the change in pixel values between one frame and the successive
frame is observed to bring out only the objects that are seen in motion.
From these objects, the moving human silhouette can be extracted. The
result of background subtraction is usually binarized in which the
moving object seems to be white and the background is black, or vice
versa in some cases. The novelty mainly lies in how the features are
extracted.

##### Earlier model-free methods

The earliest known spatiotemporal gait recognition techniques started in
the late 80s. ( Niyogi & Adelson , 1994 ) proposed to recognize gait at
a sagittal angle with the subject walking frontoparallel. It modelled
the human gait in the form of a set of spatiotemporal snakes ( Kass
et al. , 1988 ) from the slices of the moving parts of the human contour
along the time domain. The recognition accuracy they have obtained with
26 image sequences across five human subjects reaches up to 83%. Little
& Boyd ( 1998 ) introduced the concept of optical flow in gait
recognition. In principle, the points in the image sequence that vary
with time tend to oscillate periodically during the subject’s gait. By
observing the optical flow of these points, the @xmath time varying
scalars can be produced. The phases of oscillations from these scalars
are used to represent the gait instance. They reached a higher
recognition rate of up to 95% by testing their technique with seven
instances for each of six human subjects.

An earlier version of template matching method was proposed by Huang
et al. ( 1999 ) . They used the Eigenspace transformation (EST), as
adopted by Murase & Sakai ( 1996 ) , to convert the gait taken as a
sequence of images to a template called the ‘eigengait’. On top of this,
canonical space transformation was applied with generalized Fisher
linear discriminant function to separate the classes boundaries required
for prediction. However, they also seemed to use the small dataset used
by Little and Boyd for their application to show a questionable accuracy
of 100%.

Though the above methods show attractive recognition rates, all the
methods proposed at those times before suffered one major drawback:
their accuracies were biased to their samples which were too small when
considering the application as a biometric. The advent of the DARPA’s
HumanID programme in the break of the second millennium led to a major
development in gait biometric research. Bigger datasets with more
variations challenged researchers to design better algorithms.

#### 9.2 Model-free Template-based Methods

A gait template can be obtained as the result of transforming the
sequence of silhouette images taken from a gait video to a single image
that holds the composition of the motion-related features of the
sequence. Some of the notable template-based gait recognition methods in
literature are listed in Table 4 .

Hayfron-Acquah et al. ( 2003 ) assessed the symmetry of the extracted
silhouette using a generalized symmetry operator. The contours obtained
from the silhouette sequence were used to produce a symmetry map.
Euclidean distance between Fourier descriptors was used as a similarity
measure for gait recognition. They reported a CCR of 97.3% for @xmath
and 96.4% @xmath using the nearest neighbour classifier.

Wang et al. ( 2003a ) proposed a unique method to recognize gait by
analysing the contours of the silhouettes. The shape of the contour of a
given silhouette sequence was converted to a template with the use of
Procrustes shape analysis. Different exemplars were created for each
viewpoint. They tried three types of nearest neighbour algorithms, viz.,
NN, @xmath NN, and ENN (NN with class exemplar), in which ENN provided
the best results for gait recognition.

Experimental results of Cuntoor et al. ( 2003 ) suggests that DTW and
HMM can be combined to produce a better gait recognition result. DTW was
used to align the motion of the arms and legs to normalize the phase of
gait while HMM was used to define the leg dynamics.

The efforts of the University of South Florida ( Sarkar et al. , 2005 )
has brought forth a new revolution to gait recognition by compiling the
largest dataset of its time, the USF Gait Challenge. It was categorized
to 12 challenge probe sets for experimentation and a gallery set for
training. A simple baseline algorithm was developed to facilitate users
of the dataset to compare the performance of gait algorithms
effectively. The algorithm involves the use of the Tanimoto similarity
measure to gauge the similarity between two silhouettes which is given
by @xmath . Here, @xmath and @xmath are two binarized images where each
image is represented as an ordered set of pixel values. The correlation
between the silhouette similarities provided the measure of closeness
used for the recognition step. Further details of the USF Gait Challenge
dataset is provided in Section 10 .

The most notable form of silhouette-based gait recognition techniques
use the production of a Gait Energy Image (GEI) template ( Han & Bhanu ,
2006 ) from the gait cycle. Technically, the GEI shows how energy is
dissipated spatially through the stages of the gait cycle. It is so
prevalent in literature such that silhouette based methods that are
published after its time (2006) can be classified either as GEI-based or
non-GEI-based. The GEI is created by superimposing the pixels of
silhouette sequence of a given gait by summing the values and averaging
them resulting in the output as a grey-level image of proportional pixel
intensities. Hence the final stage boils down to image comparison of the
test GEI with the GEIs in the gait database. An example of a GEI
obtained from a subject’s gait from the CASIA-B dataset along the
sagittal plane is as shown in Figure 8 . The features are learned based
on Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA) ( Duda et al. , 2001 ) after
passing through Principle Component Analysis (PCA) ( Jolliffe , 2002 )
for dimensionality reduction. The Euclidean distances towards the class
centres with respect to the features provide the closeness measure for
recognition. Experimental results of Han & Bhanu ( 2006 ) show
recognition rates averaging around 55.64% over all probes of the USF
Gait Challenge v2.1 database, but normal recognition rates reach from
90% to 100%.

Although it was a a significant breakthrough in gait biometrics, the GEI
had one major setback, namely, covariate factors. When the subject, for
instance, wears an overcoat, the CCR can drop to less than 50%. Many
studies then published their version of an energy image adopted from the
core principles of the GEI to overcome this drawback. They differ mainly
in the collation operation – the operation used to combine the
silhouette sequence to a single image. Some of the notable ones are
given as follows.

-    [topsep=0pt, noitemsep, leftmargin=*]

-    Gait Flow Image (GFI) incorporates optical flow ( Lam et al. , 2011
    )

-    Enhanced GEI considers only dynamic regions ( Yang et al. , 2008 )

-    Gait Fluctuation Image (GFlucI) highlights temporal irregularities
    in gait ( Aqmar et al. , 2014 )

-    Chrono-Gait Image (CGI) maintains temporal information through
    colour ( Wang et al. , 2012 )

-    Motion History Image (MHI) for activity recognition ( Ahad , 2012 )
    was adapted for gait recognition ( Nguyen et al. , 2014 )

-    Gait Entropy Image (GEnI) incorporates Shannon’s entropy function
    for each pixel ( Bashir et al. , 2010 )

-    Active Energy Image (AEI) takes the average of each frame-to-frame
    difference ( Zhang et al. , 2010 )

-    Depth Gradient Histogram Energy Image (DGHEI) combines depth
    information from Kinect ( Hofmann et al. , 2012 )

-    Gait Information Image (GII) ( Arora et al. , 2015 ) incorporates
    Hanman-Anirban entropy function ( Hanmandlu & Das , 2011 )

Instead of coming up with new types of templates, it would be wiser to
take only a subset of the gait template that is resilient to covariate
factors. Dupuis et al. ( 2013 ) were among the first to propose this
model. They formulated a single mask through the ranking of pixel
features using the Random Forests classifier. Their panoramic gait
recognition (PGR) algorithm used pose estimation for view prediction.
Choudhury & Tjahjadi ( 2015 ) designed a method named view-invariant
multiscale gait recognition (VI-MGR) which applied Shannon’s entropy
function to only the lower limb region of the GEI. The sub-region
selection was later modified by Rida et al. ( 2016 ) by automating this
segmentation procedure with a process known as group lasso of motion
(GLM). Their approach to the problem has shown significant improvement
in the covariate recognition accuracy.

Recently, the success of deep learning in the fields of image and
activity recognition has motivated its application to gait recognition.
The basic feature representations of these methods are also gait
templates. Shiraga et al. ( 2016 ) employed a CNN (Convolutional Neural
Network) to define the degree of dissimilarity between two GEI
templates, i.e., a probe GEI and a gallery GEI. Deep learning requires a
lot of training samples, so they used the largest gait dataset publicly
available which is the OU-ISIR-LP dataset. This method, named GEINet,
produced an accuracy of 95% for same angle and 80-95% for cross angle
performance. Li et al. ( 2017 ) proposed the DeepGait design to
outperform GEINet using the VGG (Visual Geometry Group, Simonyan &
Zisserman , 2014 ) deep convolution model and Joint Bayesian model for
view invariance. Using the same dataset, the DeepGait achieved gait
identification rates of up to 98% and its cross-view identification
accuracy range from 88 to 98%. A more thorough experimentation using CNN
was conducted by Wu et al. ( 2017 ) on both OU-ISIR-LP and CASIA-B
datasets. They used three different CNN configurations for gait
identification. Their experimentation revealed that the ensemble of the
networks with GEI and additional temporal features gave the best
accuracy. Though their cross-view normal recognition performance became
the state-of-the-art, their accuracy for covariate factors are
relatively low. The average CCRs with SetB ranged from 80 to 90%, and
SetC ranged from 60 to 75 across view angles.

As attractive as deep learning sounds, its integration with legacy
camera networks is not so simple due to its computational complexity.
Moreover, the experiments of Choudhury & Tjahjadi ( 2015 ) and Rida
et al. ( 2016 ) revealed that it is possible to attain close to ideal
gait recognition accuracy without the need for a deep learning
framework.

#### 9.3 Model-free Non-template Methods

Though found to be efficient in practice, not all silhouette-based
methods in literature involve the production of a template image.
Notable non-template methods are shown in Table 5 . Foster et al. ( 2003
) have claimed to have attained recognition rates above 75% by running
experiments on 114 subjects of the SOTON video gait dataset. Their
method monitors the temporal changes in the areas of the clipped gait
window segmented by masked sectors. Using these time-varying area
metrics, they formulate a feature vector for recognition.

In the work of Boulgouris et al. ( 2006 ) , accounted the average
distance from the centre of the silhouette. Each silhouette was
represented as a feature vector which was composed of a sequence of
angular transforms made on segmented angular slices @xmath . In the USF
gait challenge dataset, a period in the gallery (reference) is not equal
to that of the probe sequence (test). Hence, a technique called linear
time normalization was utilized to make the feature matrix of each probe
and gallery sequence comparable by compensating for the difference in
the sequence length. The same method was used in their next paper (
Boulgouris & Chi , 2007 ) but with a different feature extraction
technique. In this work, the body as depicted in the silhouette was
segmented into body components. The components were ranked with
according to their proportional relevance during the comparison
operation.

Liu & Sarkar ( 2007 ) promoted the fusion of face and gait biometrics.
The exemplars, in this case, are obtained from specified stances
analogous to the formally depicted gait cycle. These stance frames were
modelled using a population EigenStance-HMM; a method that was extended
from their previous technique, population HMM ( Liu & Sarkar , 2006 ) .
A given gait silhouette sequence can be segregated into these stance
models by @xmath -means clustering with Tanimoto distance as the
distance measure. A cyclic Bakis variant of HMM was modelled for the
gait recognition. This gait recognition algorithm was used in
combination of face recognition using Elastic Bunch Graph Matching
(EBGM) based on Gabor features to attain a much higher performance over
the Gait Challenge baseline algorithm when compared using the toughest
sets of the USF Gait Challenge dataset.

A gait recognition that analyses both shape and motion was proposed by
Choudhury & Tjahjadi ( 2013 ) . The gait period here was depicted as ten
phases. Spatiotemporal shape features are obtained from these phases in
the form of Fourier descriptors. The silhouette contour at each step was
segmented by fitting ellipses. The similarity was then calculated by
utilizing Bhattacharyya distance between the ellipse parameters taken as
features. DTW was applied to compare leading knee rotation with
relevance to arm swing pattern over a gait cycle. DTW was used to
counteract the effects of walking speed, clothing, shadows, and hair
styles.

#### 9.4 Model-based Techniques

While basic spatiotemporal methods give cues as to how the body position
vary with accordance to time as a whole, it would be much more accurate
to do a spatiotemporal analysis on all articulation points separately.
The implementation of that sort falls under the category of joint
trajectory or model-based methods. That is, the trajectory of each joint
is tracked live and analysed as individual components; efforts are made
to model the human structure accurately. Table 6 list some of the
model-based gait recognition literature.

Bulb markers can be attached to certain points on the body considered
necessary for gait analysis such as ankles, knees, hands, elbows,
shoulders and torso. When observed from a camera with a low exposure,
only the bulb illumination can be perceived. This method facilitates an
easier and a more accurate analysis of gait through computer vision.
Tanawongsuwan & Bobick ( 2001 ) implemented this by strapping 18 human
subjects with 16 markers at appropriate locations and projected their
gait at a sagittal angle. The sensors were able to reconstruct a mobile
skeletal structure recovered from the joints. From this data, they were
able to assess the articulation points over time. The variance in time
was normalized by applying DTW, and the recognition was based on the
nearest neighbour algorithm to produce a modest recognition rate of 73%.

A study by Geradts et al. ( 2002 ) was conducted to extract gait-related
parameters from all three planes – frontal, transverse and sagittal –
from surveillance cameras. 11 human subjects participated in the
experiment and involved the use of 11 bulb markers fitted to the
necessary points to each subject. They were able to observe various
parameters from step length, cycle time and cadence to joint angles and
spatial positioning. After a simple analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the
gait parameters extracted, it seemed like the foot angle exhibited the
most variance and then the time average hip joint angles followed by

the step length. Hence these are considered to be the best parameters to
be used for recognition. However, their research concluded that the gait
analysis cannot be used for identification at that time (the year 2002).

Tanawongsuwan & Bobick ( 2003a ) later produced a study on the
recognition of gait in different speeds of walking, but this time, they
resorted to a more comfortable reflective suit for the articulation
point signal extraction. The experimentation is described in
Tanawongsuwan & Bobick ( 2003b ) . A 12-camera VICON MoCap system was
used for the 3D motion analysis. The result based on 15 human subjects
concluded that a positive linear correlation could be observed between
cadence and speed, and a negative exponential correlation could be
observed between stride time and speed.

The methods described so far require the use of complicated hardware for
better accuracy. They either require reflectors, bulb markers, or
magneto sensors to be fitted on to the points of interest of the human
subject to gather the point-light information during his/her gait. Due
to their nature, these methods are not practically feasible for a
biometric application. It is to note that the concept of being an
‘unobtrusive’ means of biometrics is lost here.

Not all model-based techniques, however, are impractical in application.
Zhang et al. ( 2007 ) show that it is possible to extract a five-link
biped human model from a two-dimensional video feed to produce a
model-based gait recognition system. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (
Chib & Greenberg , 1995 ) was used for the feature extraction. An
innovative yet simple method for locating the articulation points of the
lower limb joints was implemented by Goffredo et al. ( 2008 ) . By
making smart estimates on where to initialize the points, the
point-light data for the hip, both knees and ankles were extracted. This
method was able to extract these points over multiple views as provided
by the CASIA-B video database. By recording the temporal changes of
these points, a profile recorded could be recognized with the help of
the @xmath NN algorithm.

A standard video feed would provide a two-dimensional data for
processing. When added with depth-based information, more accurate
conclusions can be drawn to aid recognition. Microsoft Kinect provides
this functionality. The Kinect was used by Chattopadhyay et al. ( 2015 )
and Kastaniotis et al. ( 2015 ) by facilitating three-dimensional data
flow for a more natural and efficient biometric gait recognition.
Methods using the Kinect were found to be more successful than using
silhouettes alone for model-based analysis.

#### 9.5 Covariate Factors

Covariate factors are intra-class variations that inhibit the
effectiveness of biometric gait recognition by confounding the features
that can be observed ( Boyd & Little , 2005 ) . The following briefly
explains each factor with relevant research on how they deviate the
parameters of gait.

Walking surface. Studies show that when the surface is unstable such as
a wet surface, the walking speed, toe-in angle and step length are
significantly reduced to retain control over balance ( Menant et al. ,
2009 ) . However, when walking on other irregular surfaces like grass,
foam or studded with small obstacles, walking speed can be maintained
with a variable cadence and a longer stride length ( Menz et al. , 2003
) . Even two regular surfaces such as vinyl and carpet have a
significant difference ( Kleiner et al. , 2015 ) . In slippery surfaces,
reductions can also be observed in stance duration, load supporting
foot, normalized stride length ( Cham & Redfern , 2002 ) .

Footwear. When the footwear is considerably different, so is the gait of
the individual. This aspect especially concerns high heel users. To
maintain their stability, people wearing high heels require more control
over their centre of mass ( Chien et al. , 2014 ) and tend to have
longer double support times ( Menant et al. , 2009 ) . Recent studies
show that habitually shod walkers and habitual barefoot walkers
exhibited a significant gait difference when switching their footwear in
terms of their stride length and cadence ( Franklin et al. , 2015 ) .

Injury. When any portion of the lumbar region or lower limb is injured,
the individual naturally adopt an antalgic gait. The individual walks in
a way so as to avoid the pain caused by the injury. This style of
walking restricts the range of motion of the associated limb leading to
a deviation in the usual gait proportional to the magnitude of the
injury. In-depth research on how an injury can affect gait was provided
by Wang ( 2012 ) .

Muscle development. The development of muscles gives a different range
of control over the parts of the body that affect gait. The sheer mass
of the developed muscles alters the centre of mass at the associated
mobile limb as well as the body itself. The shift depends on the
difference in mass. The change in the centre of mass can modify the
inclination of pressure required for proper stability ( Lee & Chou ,
2006 ) . An extensive study on the correlation between muscle mass with
gait performance ( Beaudart et al. , 2015 ) proves that muscle mass
directly relates to gait speed, especially in the case of geriatric
patients.

Fatigue. When the individual is subjected to fatigue, the stability of
the concerned gait decreases while a noticeable increase in variability
of gait is exhibited ( Vieira et al. , 2016 ) . The time taken for the
recovery towards normal gait depends on the extent of exertion applied
to the individual so as to get to a fatigued state and the individual’s
stamina. This aspect was observed from Ashley Putnam’s thesis ( Putnam ,
2013 ) in which a study with army cadet treadmill protocol was conducted
to analyse the effect of exhaustion on gait mechanics and possible
injury. Cadets ran till exhaustion and had their gaits observed. The
resulting gait had both inter- and intra-variable vertical stiffness in
the lower limbs.

Training. When the individual is subjected to some form of physical
training, it is possible that her/his gait is also subjected to change.
This change can be evident as a result of military training, prolonged
load condition, prolonged use of particular footwear and athletic
training.

Extrinsic control. Humans have an ability to control their gait to an
extent so as to differ from their usual gait. A person can mince walk,
and depending on how self-aware the individual may be she/he can walk
with a swagger or strut, a brisk walk or tip-toe. Another matter to note
is the level of awareness the individual has of his/her surroundings.
Hence, individuals tend to alter their gait to the extent that is
determined by their self-control. This concept explains how members of
the army can synchronize gait during a march.

Intrinsic control. Some elements can control a person’s gait in such a
way that the individual is sometimes unaware of the change that takes
place. The best example of this case is the emotional response or mood
of the individual: state of happiness, sorrow, anger or any other
emotion strong enough to make an impact on one’s gait. The variability
can range from subtle to significant and can vary from one person to
another. Related studies are provided in Montepare et al. ( 1987 ) ;
Venture et al. ( 2014 ) and Schneider et al. ( 2014 ) .

Age. Although the factor may not contribute to change in gait over a
short period, it certainly does influence gait to a large extent.
Ageing, in general, causes musculoskeletal and neuromuscular losses. To
compensate for these losses, the individual makes certain adjustments
which can be observed in the individual’s gait ( Moniz-Pereira et al. ,
2012 ) .

Clothing. While the change of clothing does not necessarily modify the
gait for slight differences in weight, it might, however, show changes
in the associated silhouettes. This change would affect a major portion
of gait recognition algorithms that depend on the spatial configuration
of silhouettes. However, a greater change in the weight of the clothing,
such as a winter suit, has a higher probability of affecting the gait
itself.

Load. The effect of load can significantly influence gait. In a loaded
condition such as wearing a backpack, the individual is subjected to a
higher weight in addition to his/her body weight. The foot exerts higher
pressure during plantarflexion to regulate locomotion generating a
greater ground reaction force than the unloaded condition ( Castro
et al. , 2015 ) . Apart from the pressure applied, the body must cope
with the change in balance for a stable gait ( Mummolo et al. , 2016 ) .
The load can also be asymmetrical, such as a wearing a handbag,
cross-bag or shoulder bag, or carrying a suitcase. In this case, a
greater difference in the pelvic rotation is observed ( Hyung et al. ,
2016 ) . The body shifts the pelvic movement so as to counteract the
imbalance caused by the load.

#### 9.6 View Invariance

In addition to clothing and carrying conditions, the view angle is found
to be the most important covariate factor that affects gait recognition
performance ( Zeng & Wang , 2016 ; Huang & Boulgouris , 2008 ; Cilla
et al. , 2012 ; Liu et al. , 2013 ) . The range of features that can be
extracted can wary widely between the angles of observation. There are
essentially two types of view-invariant gait recognition models: view
transformation model (VTM) and view-preserving model (VPM).

VTMs ( Kusakunniran et al. , 2010 , 2012 ; Zhao et al. , 2016 )
transform the probe sequence’s angle to match with that of the gallery
sequence. The VTM methods may differ in the measures used to gauge the
transformation accuracy ( Muramatsu et al. , 2016 ) . However, a
significant level of error is inevitable in VTM-based gait recognition (
Liu et al. , 2011 ; Dupuis et al. , 2013 ) .

VPMs consider multiple views as part of the gallery itself. This process
incorporates the view information within the feature set for the
extraction of relevant view-invariant gait features. Various methods can
be employed to facilitate this. Examples include varying width vectors (
Zeng & Wang , 2016 ) , Grassmann manifold ( Connie et al. , 2017 ) ,
geometric view estimation ( Jia et al. , 2015 ) , and spatiotemporal
feet positioning ( Verlekar et al. , 2016 ) . A variant of VPM involves
extraction of view-independent features through multi-view training and
then use a single gallery view for testing ( Liu et al. , 2011 ; Tang
et al. , 2017 ) .

### 10 Datasets

With the outbreak of a substantial amount of algorithms to analyse gait
there also comes a need to compare them. A standard gait dataset would
be able to serve means so as to benchmark such algorithms especially in
the case of biometric application. The categories of datasets cover a
wide range based on the needs of the gait analyst from lightweight
datasets to large-scale databases. An overview of the gait databases
described here is given in Table 7 .

When DARPA launched the HumanID programme in the year 2000, many
institutions joined and released their first version of the database in
the year 2001. Institutions that released their dataset for public usage
include MIT, CMU, SOTON, Georgia Tech, UMD, USF, and CASIA. Nearly all
of the institutions whose databases are described in this section are
associated with this programme. The programme ended in 2004 due to
privacy issues ( Nixon et al. , 2010 ) , but the databases compiled as a
result is still publicly available from the institutions that developed
them. The choice of the database depends on the use-case. This thesis
involves the design of biometric algorithms that are resilient to
multiple views. The datasets with the most views are CASIA-B and
SOTON-Temporal. However, CASIA-B has 124 subjects while SOTON-Temporal
has only 25. Furthermore, most literature published in view-invariant
recognition systems also use the CASIA-B for their evaluation. Using the
same dataset with similar training and testing conditions would
facilitate a fairer comparison. Due to better balance between covariate
factors, the number of subjects and the number of instances per subject,
the CASIA-B dataset is selected as a benchmark dataset for the
experimental validation of the proposed algorithms.

The CASIA datasets are compiled by the Institute of Automation, Chinese
Academy of Sciences. CASIA has developed four public gait databases till
date. The development started in 2001 at the National Laboratory of
Pattern Recognition (NLPR). In addition to the video, the silhouettes
for each of their datasets are freely available for download. With 124
individuals ( @xmath ) each performing 10 gait instances ( @xmath )
observed in 11 simultaneous view angles ( @xmath ), the total number of
sequences for the CASIA-B dataset would be

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The 10 instances can be split up as SetA containing 6 normal instances,
SetB with 2 instances carrying a bag, and SetC consisting of 2 instances
wearing a coat. Along with an additional video of bare background, the
total number of videos becomes 15004 (approximately 17.4 GB). The
background is mostly plain light green with two stage markings covering
both the wall and the floor ( Yu et al. , 2006 ) . This is the most
commonly used multiview database in literature. Figure 9 shows a
depiction of the dataset for a given time instant from each of the 11
angles.

### 11 Summary

The biometric features of gait can be observed in a variety of ways
wherein inertial sensor-based and computer vision-based are most
researched in literature. Biometrics, in general, can be categorized as
either hard or soft. Gender is found to be the most popular soft
biometric in gait analysis; age estimation is the next most common soft
biometric. Hard biometrics consider the problem of recognition
(identification) and authentication (verification).

Biometric feature extraction can be classified as either model-free or
model-based. Model-free approaches analyse the gait structure as a whole
while model-based methods analyse joint-trajectories (usually in
three-dimensions). Model-free methods can be further classified as
either template-based or non-template. Template-based methods compile a
single image called a gait template while non-template blurs between
model-free and model-based methods in 2D space. Template-based methods
are more successful than non-template methods in recent literature and
have more practical scope than model-based methods.

Covariate factors increase the difficulty of gait recognition. Gait
datasets mostly focus on difference in clothing conditions, carrying
conditions, footwear and view angles. CASIA-B is currently the most
commonly used multi-view gait dataset.

## Chapter \thechapter Gender Classification Through Pose-Based Voting

### 12 Introduction

Gender classification has several applications. In surveillance systems,
the prior identification of gender can substantially reduce the search
space required to find a specific person among many in a video feed ( Yu
et al. , 2009 ) . The classification could help analyse the relationship
between gender and product preference in customer-market studies ( Jones
et al. , 2017 ) . The knowledge of one’s gender can provide natural
human-computer interaction in robotics ( Ramey & Salichs , 2014 ) . Many
methods were suggested to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of the
gait sequence to infer the gender of the associated subject ( Prakash
et al. , 2016 ) . Yu et al. ( 2009 ) claim that an effective gender
identification system can exceed the accuracy of human-based
observation.

In this chapter, we delve into a gait-based gender recognition algorithm
that employs a technique that delineates the gait instance as a sequence
of poses or frames. The system predicts the gender of each frame that
constitutes the gait instance and decides whether the subject is male or
female based on majority voting. This method is called pose-based voting
(PBV) as illustrated in Figure 10 . The intuition behind this approach
relies on the fact that humans tend to assume certain poses at each part
of the gait cycle that would reflect their innate gender. The classifier
tries to make a prediction based on the aggregate of the poses it
records. Thus, the temporal element of gait is not processed by the
classifier but just the spatial features. By removing the reliance on
temporal features, the system would effectively deal with partially
occluded gait cycles and temporary occlusion.

Two feature extraction techniques are investigated in this method:
elliptic Fourier descriptors (EFD) ( Kuhl & Giardina , 1982 ) , and
consolidate vector of row-column summation (RCS). The EFD is supported
by its rotation invariance property while the RCS is more simple yet
effective to implement. Both of these methods are extensively studied
with the widely used CASIA-B dataset, and the results are compared to
the state-of-the-art approaches through recommended test conditions.

### 13 State of the Art

The gait instance is given as input to the system in the same manner as
it is done for gait recognition and authentication. That is, the video
feed is converted to frames through which silhouettes are extracted. The
silhouettes are pure binary colour coded with black and white. The usual
norm is then to extract only a single gait cycle from the entire
sequence and make the prediction based on the patterns observed from
that period.

Hu et al. ( 2011 ) developed the current state of the art in gender
classification based on gait. The process involves dividing the
normalized silhouettes to @xmath and @xmath cells and the fitting of
ellipses (as in Little & Boyd , 1998 ) . The extracted features are then
modelled using MCRF along with a combination of complicated operations
including the Karhunen-Loeve transformation ( Dony , 2000 ) and Xie and
Beni’s (XB) index ( Xie & Beni , 1991 ) . Their implementation was
tested on the CASIA-B dataset to achieve an accuracy of 98.39%.

Nguyen et al. ( 2017 ) implemented a method to detect gender with no
more than a single video frame through a CNN. However, CNNs are known to
be computationally expensive in operation. As the application in focus
concerns gait, more frames are available per instance. Analysing each
frame of a gait sequence with a simpler algorithm can yield an equal or
better result than taking only a single frame with a complex algorithm.

Most existing implementations adopt the SVM classifier for the gender
recognition problem especially when a gait template like the GEI is used
(see Li et al. , 2008 ; Yu et al. , 2009 ; Igual et al. , 2013 ) . Some
relatively new methods include the mixed continuous random field (MCRF)
by Hu et al. ( 2011 ) , sparse representation-based classification by Lu
et al. ( 2014 ) , and CNN by Nguyen et al. ( 2017 ) .

### 14 Method

The schematic flow of the proposed system is illustrated in Figure 11 .
The videos containing the gait instances are delineated into frames
through which silhouettes are obtained and binarized. The forthcoming
sections discuss two different feature extraction techniques, EFD and
RCS. Instead of taking a spatiotemporal template of the entire gait
sequence, each silhouette is considered to be a separate instance to the
LDA-Bayes classifier. The classifier makes predictions on each frame of
the test video. The statistical mode (majority vote) of the aggregate
predictions become the final prediction of the system.

#### 14.1 Elliptic Fourier Descriptors

Chain encoding is a technique that is used to provide a compressed
representation of image contours ( Freeman , 1974 ) . Kuhl & Giardina (
1982 ) presented that elliptic properties of Fourier coefficients can be
exploited to characterize a closed contour. The resulting features are
called elliptic Fourier descriptors. The major advantage of this method
is that the contours that are reconstructed are said to be independent
of the starting point of the contour. Furthermore, the EFD has a
rotation and scale invariance property that describes the image with the
same set of coefficients irrespective of the orientation and size of the
object in two-dimensional space.

Figure 12 depicts the reconstruction of the EFD in different levels of
harmonics extracted from a human silhouette. The real silhouette is
superimposed with the reconstructed @xmath -harmonic representations of
the chain code for reference.

The chain code V of a contour consisting of K points is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath can take the values from 0 through 7 representing the 8
possible pixel directions taken anticlockwise (although the contour is
traversed clockwise). The required time to travel across the link @xmath
is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The required time to plot up to @xmath chain links is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and @xmath is considered to be the chain’s basic period.

The differences in the projections of @xmath and @xmath are

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

where sgn is a sign function given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The Fourier series for the @xmath and @xmath projections can be expanded
as follows.

  -- -------- -------- -- -----
     @xmath   @xmath      (1)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2)
  -- -------- -------- -- -----

where

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

Equations 1 and 2 are expanded up to @xmath harmonics ² ² 2 The
derivation of the elliptic Fourier descriptors for closed contours can
be found in detail in the work by Kuhl & Giardina ( 1982 ) . In the
generalized equations, @xmath . The value of @xmath determines the
complexity of fit. The DC components @xmath and @xmath are given by

  -- -------- -- --
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- --

where

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

For each harmonic level, four more coefficients are generated, @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath , and @xmath . These parameters are used as features for
the training. Thus, the EFD provides a total of @xmath features per
sample for a fixed value of @xmath .

#### 14.2 Row-Column Summation

One way to extract both horizontal and vertical features of a silhouette
would be to take the count of white pixels in each of @xmath and @xmath
axes. An illustration of this is given in Figure 13 . The figure depicts
the number of white pixels in each row @xmath and column @xmath . The
properties of the binarized silhouette are exploited to facilitate the
vectorized version of this operation.

Let @xmath denote the count of white pixels at row @xmath , and @xmath
be number of white pixels in column @xmath . The row and column vectors
are given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath and @xmath are taken as 240 in this implementation. The
number of white pixels of a row of a binarized image can be taken as the
sum of all values in that row. Thus, @xmath contains the row-wise sum of
the silhouette. Similarly, @xmath stores the column-wise sum. Together,
these vectors describe the pose of the silhouette in the image. The
concatenation of both these vectors, @xmath , can be utilized as the
feature set of the image and are called the row-column summation or RCS.

Note that each silhouette is taken to be a square rather than a
rectangle with the height greater than the width. This size makes sure
that the entire space of movement freedom is covered by the subject.
According to the anatomy of an average human, the arm-span is
approximately equal to the height ( Creed , 1986 ) . This notion is also
adopted by Zheng et al. ( 2011b ) when generating a public dataset of
GEI from the CASIA-B dataset.

#### 14.3 Pose-Based Voting

The initial step of nearly any gait-based biometric system is silhouette
extraction which is achieved through background subtraction. In cases
where the environment is highly dynamic, algorithms like the one
suggested by Panda & Meher ( 2016 ) can be employed. They use a modified
version of the colour difference histogram through fuzzy c-means
clustering to eliminate the excessive noise in the background. As the
dataset in this study (CASIA-B) is composed only of a static background,
a slightly primitive foreground detection routine is applied. Further
description of the dataset is provided in Section 10 . In this step, the
difference between the background frame @xmath and the current frame at
instance @xmath would give the silhouette of the moving object at frame
@xmath ( Rosebrock , 2016 ) . A standard camera can introduce noise
between successive frames even in a static environment. Hence, a
Gaussian blur operation applied before the difference is computed to
eliminate the subtle noise.

Algorithm 1 PBV training routine

Each silhouette extracted is clipped and scaled to standard proportions.
This procedure is considered to be normalization ( Zheng et al. , 2011b
) . Each sample contains a complete human silhouette with the dimensions
@xmath pixels and binarized. A pseudocode of the training process is
given in Algorithm 1 . The feature vectors are extracted from each
silhouette and are labelled to form the training set. This study
compares the effectiveness of both EFD and RCS feature extraction
methods. The feature space is then transformed through Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and trained through a multivariate Gaussian
Bayes’ rule (MGBayesFit). The model thus produced is composed of a set
of parameters that are used to make the gender prediction during the
testing phase. These include the transformation vectors from LDA and the
probabilities from Bayes’ rule.

The LDA transformation maximizes inter-class distance while minimizing
the intra-class distance ( Duda et al. , 2001 ) . LDA is more commonly
used in gait recognition algorithms along with principal component
analysis ( Rida et al. , 2016 ) . As the number of features is already
sufficiently small for processing, an unclassified feature reduction
like PCA would not be necessary.

The transformed data is passed through a multivariate Gaussian model of
Bayes’ rule ( Hastie et al. , 2005 ) for classification. This is not a
naïve Bayes implementation where a product of multiple univariate normal
distributions are taken as the likelihood. The Bayes classifier is given
by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath

where the likelihood term, @xmath , is calculated with @xmath
distributed as a multivariate normal distribution, @xmath .

Algorithm 2 PBV testing routine

The salient part of the algorithm lies in the testing routine (Algorithm
2 ). The preprocessing step is analogous to the training sequence where
each silhouette is normalized and has its feature extracted (with either
EFD or RCS). Once each silhouette is classified, the statistical mode of
the separate predictions become the final prediction of the system. This
event can be thought of as each prediction trying to elect for a
specific gender which can assume the pose it depicts and the final
selection being the majority vote of the individual silhouettes.

A specific experiment is conducted to test the handling of occlusion
which leads to the partial observation of gait cycles. In this setup, a
complete gait cycle of each training instance is given to both the
existing and proposed PBV method for learning. Then, during testing,
partial gait cycles were given ranging from 10% to 100% of the gait
cycle pertaining to the test gait instance. The existing method would
attempt to compile a gait template and then process it for
classification. The PBV method, on the other hand, judges the gender
based on the votes currently accumulated.

### 15 Experimentation & Evaluation

The Python programming framework is used for all simulations in this
thesis. Classification and feature transformation routines are applied
with the help of the Scikit-Learn package ( Pedregosa et al. , 2011 ) .
All graphs were plot using the Matplotlib ( Hunter , 2007 ) .

#### 15.1 Dataset Configuration

All experiments have been conducted using the video instances from the
CASIA-B gait database ( Yu et al. , 2006 ) as it is currently the most
common database to evaluate gender recognition. It holds videos
containing the gait of 93 males and 31 females in three different
covariate factors: normal, carrying a bag, and wearing a coat. The
dataset and testing conditions are formulated exactly as prescribed by
Hu et al. ( 2011 ) with 31 female subjects and 31 randomly selected male
subjects following a 31-fold cross validation evaluation. All six
instances of normal walk, without bag or coat, observed at the sagittal
angle were utilized for the selected subjects. The total number of video
instances hence used are @xmath . As this is a two-class categorization
problem, the equal proportion of both classes avoids bias in the
classification results. A 31-fold cross-validation testing scheme is
used for evaluation. Each fold is disjoint and contains all videos of
one male and one female subject.

#### 15.2 Number of Harmonics for EFD

The code for EFD was extended from Alessandro Ferrari’s implementation (
Ferrari et al. , 2017 ) . The complexity of the Fourier descriptors is
determined by the number of harmonics expanded, @xmath . This value is
empirically chosen in accordance with the effect it has on the system
accuracy by conducting a standard testing-training split with varying
values of @xmath . The training test composes of 25 folds while the
remaining 6 folds form the testing set. This configuration is similar to
the test conditions used by Huang & Wang ( 2007 ) . The outcome is
presented in Figure 14 . The classifier accuracy is the CCR of the
LDA-Bayes classifier, i.e., the proportion of silhouettes correctly
classified to the total number of silhouettes in the test set. The
system accuracy is the CCR of the PBV framework, i.e., the fraction of
video instances correctly classified. One can clearly visualize the
impact of the majority vote on the system. At the point where @xmath ,
the system accuracy stabilizes while the classifier’s CCR slowly
increases. @xmath is set to 12 to safely avoid probable bias in the
selection of the training and testing folds.

#### 15.3 Performance in Partial Gait Cycles

Gait is composed of multiple phases which occur as repeated sequence of
events. A gait cycle is a period between the occurrence of any two of
the same gait event in succession ( Whittle , 2007 ) . Almost all of the
algorithms reported till date require the silhouettes of a complete gait
cycle for an optimal CCR. The proposed framework would facilitate
adequate performance even at partially observed gait cycles. A simple
technique is employed to detect gait cycles to test this hypothesis.

Sarkar et al. ( 2005 ) estimated gait cycles by tracking the count of
white pixels in the lower half the silhouettes. The pixel count would
produce an oscillation signal when plotted. The silhouettes between any
three troughs or crests of the signal would yield a complete gait cycle.
However, the signal extracted could potentially contain noise which made
the detection process difficult in certain cases. Hu et al. ( 2011 )
suggested using variation in locally linear embedding (LLE) coefficient
to overcome this issue. On the contrary, to provide a simpler yet
effective approach for gait period estimation, a variant of the method
used by Sarkar et al. ( 2005 ) in conjunction with smoothing using the
Savitzky-Golay filter ( Press et al. , 1996 ) is applied.

In this implementation, the white pixel count is taken below the
half-way point from the probable knee region till the bottom end of the
silhouette to minimize the noise that could occur. The oscillation
produced can be observed as shown in Figure (a)a . Savitzky-Golay filter
is applied (SciPy implementation by Jones et al. ( 2001–2017 ) ) to
smooth the distortions in the signal. This technique keeps track of the
adjacent points to approximate the position of the current point that
would fit with the least error according to the least squares principle.
The resulting curve would look almost like a sine curve as shown in
Figure (b)b . The silhouettes between three observable troughs are taken
to compose a single complete gait cycle.

The intuition behind selecting three troughs is that at the first
trough, both feet are together with one on the floor and the other
performing midswing. The second trough denotes the half-cycle where the
latter leg is stable while the former is at midswing. The full cycle
completes at the third trough when all phases of gait are encompassed.

The GEI is used as a benchmark to represent the characteristic of
algorithms that require a complete cycle ( Li et al. , 2008 ; Yu et al.
, 2009 ; Lu et al. , 2014 ) . The classifier that is based on the GEI is
trained in a similar fashion to those in literature with pixel
intensities as attributes. The features are reduced through LDA and
classified with SVM.

The experimental setup involves testing both the PBV and the GEI-based
framework in increasing proportions of the gait cycle from partially
observed to completely observed. Learning is applied as usual with the
availability of the whole of the training video. Then, during testing,
partial gait cycles were given ranging from 10% to 100% of the gait
cycle pertaining to the test gait instance. The GEI-based method would
attempt to compile a gait template with the available silhouettes and
then process it for classification while the PBV follows the voting
method as described in Section 14.3 . The 31-fold cross-validation
accuracy is recorded at each step. To this end, the objective is to
prove that when LDA is applied, both SVM and Bayes’ rule perform
similarly. Hence, both SVM and Bayes are also compared in the analysis
with both GEI and PBV methods. SciKit Learn package ( Pedregosa et al. ,
2011 ) was used for LDA and SVM. Moreover, the experiment is repeated
for 3 different random combinations of male subjects (as there are only
31 female subjects) and the final scores are averaged at each stage.

The plots in Figure 16 clearly show that the proposed PBV method
outperforms the standard template-based method. The difference is more
pronounced at lower proportions of observed gait periods than at the
complete cycle. Also, it can be observed that both SVM and Bayes’ rule
perform almost equally with both GEI and PBV frameworks as both are
preceded with LDA transformation. Within PBV, the RCS features provide a
much more robust CCR compared to the EFD feature set.

#### 15.4 Overall Performance

The performance of the overall system along with that of the existing
implementations are compared in Table 8 . The proposed PBV system gives
an ideal result with the RCS feature scheme and a moderately good result
with the EFD feature set. The RCS relies only on the spatial features as
it incorporates both the body shape and pose of the subject that enables
it to characterize the gender of the subject under observation. Note
that the PBV accuracy that is tabulated is greater than that in Figure
16 . This phenomenon is because, during the overall test, the system
considers all possible silhouettes of the video instance; not just that
of a single gait cycle. Each video contains slightly more than a single
gait cycle while some may even contain up to two. The more silhouettes
that are extracted, the more electors there would be participating in
the voting scheme leading to a higher probability that the outcome would
be correct.

The harmonics were recomputed for higher orders up to 40 and tested
again to affirm the performance of EFD, yet the same accuracy was
obtained. Though the EFD may seem a little inaccurate compared to the
other state of the art, one can hypothesize that its full potential can
be realized through its rotation and scale invariance property. Unlike
the RCS and the other methods in the literature, the EFD is said to
generate the same set of descriptors for any orientation of the image.
This property would be useful in surveillance systems where the camera
orientation can vary, causing the silhouettes extracted to seem rotated
in 2-D space.

### 16 Summary

The state-of-the-art methods for gait-based gender recognition extract
spatiotemporal features from the gait sequence and project the entire
gait sequence as a single instance. On the contrary, the proposed PBV
projects each frame of the sequence as an instance. The PBV scheme
aggregates the predictions of each silhouette of a single gait sequence
based on a majority vote to give the final gender prediction.

Existing implementation of gait-based gender recognition show promising
results but do not consider the problem of temporary occlusion. The
proposed PBV approach yields an ideal gender recognition accuracy and is
robust to temporary occlusion of sequences of a gait video instance.

Two distinct feature representations were used in PBV, namely, EFD and
RCS. After a pass through LDA, Bayes’ rule can provide close to equal
performance to SVM. The results of both existing models and proposed
model were compared based on the CASIA-B gait dataset to show that PBV
with RCS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

## Chapter \thechapter Gait Recognition Through Genetic Template
Segmentation

### 17 Introduction

Gait recognition is the process of identifying a person through only
their gait patterns. Although the term should be technically gait
identification, the term gait recognition is much more pronounced in
literature. As discussed in Section 9 , there are both model-free and
model-based methods to do this task. Model-based methods ( Bouchrika &
Nixon , 2007 ; Goffredo et al. , 2008 ; Zhang et al. , 2007 ; Yam et al.
, 2004 ) attempt to track the dynamic changes in the articulation points
during gait and hence require intense computational effort. The
model-free approach is the most preferred as it captures the gait
patterns without this requirement.

Recent methods adopt the use of gait templates as they are simple to
implement yet highly effective in practice with the GEI ( Han & Bhanu ,
2006 ) being the most popular one among them. The GEI quickly became the
most successful method for multi-view gait recognition. Its major
drawback was its weakness to covariates like clothing and load carrying
which could adversely affect its performance. Many similar methods
followed aiming to mitigate this weakness with their implementation of
gait templates. Notable templates include the AEI ( Zhang et al. , 2010
) and the GEnI ( Bashir et al. , 2010 ) . With a slight trade-off in
normal walk gait recognition, these new templates were able to produce a
better recognition accuracy over the clothing and carrying covariates in
gait.

In this chapter, a VPM is devised that can be applied to any gait
template for gait identification. To refine the templates themselves, a
method is proposed to automate its segmentation process with the use of
the genetic algorithm (GA). These segments depict the optimal regions of
the gait template that can be used to obtain the best recognition result
at any visually affecting covariate factor. As a design choice, Bayes’
rule is used instead of the widely adopted @xmath NN.

### 18 State of the Art

Research suggests that using a proportion of the gait template that is
least affected by the covariate factors would improve the overall
accuracy of the gait recognition system. Dupuis et al. ( 2013 )
formulated a single mask through the ranking of pixel features using the
Random Forests classifier. Their panoramic gait recognition (PGR)
algorithm uses pose estimation for view prediction. Choudhury & Tjahjadi
( 2015 ) designed a VPM named view-invariant multiscale gait recognition
(VI-MGR) which applied Shannon’s entropy function to the lower limb
region of the GEI. The sub-region selection was later modified by Rida
et al. ( 2016 ) automating this segmentation procedure with a process
known as group lasso of motion (GLM). Their approach to the problem has
shown significant improvement in the covariate recognition accuracy.

Though the following implementations do not concern view-invariance or
covariate factors, their aspects add to the motivation of this approach.
Jia et al. ( 2015 ) have shown how incorporating the head and shoulder
mean shape (HSMS) along with the Lucas-Kanade variant of the gait flow
image (GFI) ( Lam et al. , 2011 ) greatly improves recognition accuracy.
The genetic algorithm ( Goldberg , 1989 ) was previously used by Yeoh
et al. ( 2014 ) to optimize the selection of model-based gait parameters
and also by Tafazzoli et al. ( 2015 ) for the selection of superimposed
contour features.

### 19 Method

An overview of the method is illustrated in Figure 17 . The first step
is to extract the gait template (such as the GEI) from the video that
contains the gait sequence. After which the database is split into two
disjoint sets – tuning set and evaluation set. The tuning set is fed to
the GA to formulate the segments for optimal performance. Only those
segments are extracted from the evaluation set to test the final
accuracy of the system.

#### 19.1 Gait Template Extraction

The model-free template representation of gait composes the feature set
for this study. All gait templates are produced in a similar procedure
to the one given below. Silhouettes in here are obtained through
background subtraction and encoded in grayscale.

1.   Extract only the silhouettes of the subject during a single gait
    cycle.

2.   The silhouettes are center-aligned and scaled to a standard size;
    240 x 240 in this case.

3.   The standardized silhouettes for a given gait sequence are merged
    through a collation process to generate the gait template.

The silhouettes are usually binarized composing only of pure white (1)
and black (0) pixels before collation. The characteristic difference
between one type of template to another lies in the collation process
adopted to compile the template image. The final image that is produced
after the collation contain pixel values varying between 0 to 1. These
values are scaled to 0 to 255 for grayscale representation.

If @xmath is the number of frames in the subset, and @xmath is the
normalized silhouette at frame @xmath , then the GEI ( Han & Bhanu ,
2006 ) template of the gait instance is collated as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Similarly, the collation operation for the AEI ( Zhang et al. , 2010 )
is given as follows assuming @xmath (black frame).

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The GEnI ( Bashir et al. , 2010 ) template is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the probability of the pixel @xmath being white in the
given subset of frames from @xmath through @xmath . Samples of the above
templates are illustrated in Figure 34 for different covariate
conditions of CASIA-B.

#### 19.2 Learning Model

The gait template that is extracted is of the dimensions @xmath which
yields the total of 57600 pixels. Each of these pixels functions as a
feature for recognition. Feeding an excessively large amount of features
directly to a machine learning algorithm would not be advisable due to
following reasons:

1.   Most of these features may not correlate with the objective
    function, which in this case is gait recognition.

2.   Many of the required features may be linearly correlated and hence
    are redundant in the feature set.

3.   Selecting only the most useful features can considerably speed up
    the training time of the model.

Hence the features require reduction before being processed by a machine
learning algorithm. Feature reduction algorithms can either be
supervised or unsupervised. Unsupervised feature reduction algorithms
transform the given feature space of unlabelled instances while the
supervised alternative requires labelled instances for feature
reduction.

For this application, the features are preprocessed by Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) followed by a multi-class Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA). The Multi-class LDA, also referred to as Multiple
Discriminant Analysis (MDA) ( Duda et al. , 2001 ) , is a supervised
dimensionality reduction method that would maximize inter-class distance
while minimizing intra-class distance. PCA ( Jolliffe , 2002 ) is an
unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithm that projects the given
features to feature space that corresponds to the highest variance. The
use of PCA yields a net positive effect on the performance of the
classifier concerning both processing time and accuracy. This type of
MDA with PCA is sometimes referred to as Canonical Discriminant Analysis
(CDA) ( Rida et al. , 2016 ) .

@xmath NN is the standard classifier used for gait recognition. This
study explores Bayes’ rule as an alternative to @xmath NN. The
performance of these two classifiers along with a few other compatible
classifiers on the GEI template is depicted in Table 9 and graphically
illustrated in Figure 19 . The parameters of all the classifiers have
been tuned to obtain the best possible performance. Hastie et al. ( 2005
) provides the detail for each of the algorithms applied. The Bayes’
rule performs marginally better than @xmath NN which perform equally
well as the SVM with linear kernel.

Although it is well adapted to many problems, Random Forest (RF) (
Breiman , 2001 ) does not apply well the problem of gait recognition.
Due to its potential in remote sensing ( Johnson & Xie , 2013 ) , the
RF’s parameters were optimized and further improved with AdaBoost ³ ³ 3
The details of AdaBoosted Random Forest and its optimization is
explained in the paper Isaac et al. ( 2017 ) . However, applying
AdaBoosted Random Forest does not make an improvement either. This is
because Random Forest is not as much effective when the number of
instances per class is small, especially when the system contains highly
dependent features. In this case, the training set only contains four
video samples for each subject, i.e., four instances per class. This
would mean that the RF does not have enough samples to learn the pattern
well.

From the above discussion, we can arrive at a decision to use the Bayes’
rule for the classification step of the gait recognition algorithm. Let
@xmath be an instance composed of features @xmath and @xmath be the
discrete outcome, then Bayes’ rule is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is called the likelihood. The likelihood can be either
naïve or multivariate. In the naïve Bayes model, the likelihood is the
product of the probability density functions @xmath of multiple
univariate Gaussian distributions like so

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The complete Bayes’ model, on the contrary, employs multivariate
Gaussian probability density as follows.

  -- -------- -------- -- -----
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (3)
  -- -------- -------- -- -----

For LDA, @xmath , where @xmath is the covariance matrix of the whole
transformed set of gallery features ( Hastie et al. , 2005 ) . The
results in Figure 19 clearly show that the multivariate model performs
much better than the naïve model.

#### 19.3 Genetic Template Segmentation

The boundary selection process is automated through GA to find the
optimum boundary to segment the gait template before the actual training
process. The gait template is to be split into four segments, viz., head
portion H, leg portion F, mid-left section L and mid-right section R.
The parameters to be optimized are the split points which divide these
sections and a weight bit per region to decide whether the respective
region should be included in the training as shown in Figure 20 . This
process is used to produce a masking template for each view angle.

The chromosome structure for the genetic optimization is given as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The variables denoted @xmath are split variables that determine the
boundary for the region to segment and is represented by 8 bits each.
@xmath defines the line between the head portion and the midsections;
@xmath determines the split between the midsections and leg region;
@xmath divides the two midsections. If @xmath is the decimal equivalent
of the 8 bits used to represent the split variables, then its value can
be decoded as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where min @xmath and max @xmath are the minimum and maximum possible
values for the variable @xmath . The variables @xmath are binary
variables that determine whether the segment is included for training, 1
indicates inclusion while 0 represents masking. The total size of
chromosome hence becomes 28 bits.

A set of subjects with all covariates included is used as a tuning set
to determine boundary locations for segmentation. The fitness function
evaluates the hypothesis generated by the chromosome against the tuning
set to produce a fitness measure. The three covariates considered here
is A: normal walk, B: carrying a bag and C: clothing condition. If the
fitness measure is simply set to the average of the accuracy of the
three covariate sets, then the GA would make a significant trade-off on
the normal walk sequence to maximize the overall accuracy. This was
experimentally observed to at 90% while the state-of-the-art approaches
produce accuracies of above 95% ( Rida et al. , 2016 ) . The fitness
measure, @xmath for a given chromosome, @xmath , is calculated as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where CCR @xmath represents the CCR for the corresponding covariate
@xmath . Giving equal weights to each of the CCR @xmath causes a
trade-off in normal condition performance leading to an accuracy of
95.6% which is among the lowest of the normal CCR (refer Table 10 ).
Thus, the highest priority was given to CCR of the normal setting, CCR
@xmath , to compete with the state of the art. In most approaches,
clothing conditions pose the greatest challenge to template-based
recognition systems. Hence the accuracy pertaining to the clothing
condition, CCR @xmath , was given the next highest weight after normal
setting to boost its accuracy on par with the carrying condition, CCR
@xmath . These priority weights were assigned empirically.

The elitist selection variant of the generation propagation is used for
this implementation of the GA ( Baluja & Caruana , 1995 ) . That is, the
chromosome corresponding to the highest fitness of a generation T @xmath
is made sure to be propagated to the next generation T @xmath . The GA
is set to follow a uniform crossover with probability 0.6, a single bit
mutation probability of 0.03 and populates 20 chromosomes per
generation. The optimization runs for 15 generations although
convergence was mostly attained before the 8 ^(th) generation during
experimental observation.

#### 19.4 View Estimation

Under the assumption that the subjects walk in a straight line for
verification, the first and last visible silhouettes, @xmath and @xmath
, are taken into consideration. Let @xmath and @xmath be the topmost and
bottom-most points of @xmath as illustrated in Figure 21 . Similarly,
@xmath and @xmath denote the topmost and bottom-most points of @xmath .
Let @xmath and @xmath be the slopes of the lines @xmath and @xmath
respectively. These two slopes alone form the features required to train
the view-estimation classifier with the view as output labels. To reduce
the number of cases, the sequence is passed through a simple check to
verify whether the angle lies in the coronal plane ( @xmath or @xmath ).
If the last silhouette overlaps the first, then the viewpoint is
determined to be at @xmath and the direct opposite for @xmath . If both
of these cases fail, then the angle should be one among those other than
the two in the coronal plane.

### 20 Experimentation & Evaluation

#### 20.1 Dataset Configuration

The CASIA dataset B is the benchmark gait database used for the
experimental validation. The dataset includes six instances of normal
walk (SetA), two instances of walking while carrying a bag (SetB) and
two instances of walking while wearing an overcoat (SetC) of 124
individuals. SetA is split to SetA1 containing four instances and SetA2
for the remaining. Only SetA1 is used for training. 24 subjects were
randomly selected from the CASIA-B dataset to participate in the tuning
set. These subjects were removed from the gallery for the evaluation
phase just as in the work of Jia et al. ( 2015 ) .

#### 20.2 Sagittal View Performance

The experiments were first executed under the sagittal angle, 90 @xmath
view, to focus on the effect of carrying and clothing covariates. The
GEI, GEnI, and AEI were used as the base templates. The templates before
and after GTS appear as shown in Figure 22 . The performance of the
proposed GTS is compared against that claimed by other approaches in
Table 10 .

The upper portion of the gait template segmented by the GA chose only
the head of the subject and neglected the shoulders as opposed to what
was selected by Jia et al. ( 2015 ) . The GA detected that the shoulder
metric would lead to a considerable loss in accuracy while wearing an
overcoat and hence chose @xmath a little before the shoulder region.

It is evident from the previously reported results in Table 10 that the
clothing condition is the most challenging covariate leading to a lesser
CCR. Clothing conditions cause a greater change in the subjects’
silhouettes. As template-based methods rely on spatiotemporal changes of
the silhouettes during gait, the recognition performance is adversely
affected. A more efficient performance is attained when the regions that
have an impact on such covariates are masked out. The arm-swing
constraints imposed by the weight of the clothing and the carrying
condition would compromise the accuracy at the midsection. As
speculated, the mid-left and mid-right sections were ignored in the
optimal hypothesis generated by the GTS for every angle and for each
type of gait template. Note that the segmented GEI has a much smaller
lower (foot) section due to the greater effect of the covariates on the
GEI template. The area permitted by the mask is 25.2% of the total
template area; neglecting the constant features, only 8.4% of the
feature space is utilized. Nevertheless, the GEI masked with GTS
outperforms the existing methods.

Genetic algorithm is known to have a tendency to give suboptimal
results. There comes a requirement to tune the parameters after the
genetic algorithm converges. The outcome of the GTS shows that only two
parameters are variable: @xmath and @xmath . That is, weight bits are
optimally assigned as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This assignment leaves @xmath irrelevant as both mid-sections are
ignored. These two variables can be sequentially optimized starting with
@xmath with a fixed @xmath and then @xmath with the optimized @xmath .
This process is also followed using the tuning set for validation.

#### 20.3 View-Invariant Performance

The GTS is applied to generate one masking template for every angle
using the tuning set. The tuning set is also used to train the view
estimator. The evaluation set is separated into gallery and probe sets.
After which, 11 LDA-Bayes classifiers are trained (one for each view
angle) using the gallery set. The angle of each instance of the probe
set is predicted with the view estimator. The boundary separation of the
view estimator is depicted in Figure 23 . The instance is then passed to
the appropriate view-specific classifier for the identity prediction.
Note that each angle set also has its own CDA transformation. PCA is set
to retain 99% of data variance. This resulted in retaining a different
number of eigenvectors for each angle for a given template. The numbers
range from 123 to 181 for GEI, 147 to 181 for GEnI, and 95 to 147 for
AEI. The number of features through LDA is at most one less than the
number of classes, which is 99 in this case.

The accuracy of each of the 11 classifiers is shown in Figure 24 and
Figure 25 . Each graph depicts the CCR of the given classifier learned
with labelled samples from a specific gallery angle and tested on all
probe angles. The results show that the system can, to a degree, handle
the neighbouring views as well but with lesser accuracy. The
neighbouring view angle performance works especially well for angles
closer to the sagittal view. On a closer examination of the boundary
separation graph in Figure 23 , we can notice that the only possible
error the view estimator can make is to mistaken the current view with
the neighbouring views. Hence, even if the neighbouring view model is
selected to predict the instance, the system can mitigate the error to a
certain level. This phenomenon becomes apparent in Figure 25 (f) when
the error is tested along with the view estimator to select the
appropriate models for the test probe instances.

Table 11 reports the CCR of the state-of-the-art view-invariant gait
recognition methods along with the best performing template with the
GTS, the GEI. All of the scores in this table have been claimed to be
obtained without the prior knowledge of the actual view angle. The
overall performance of the methods including the base templates taking
into account all angles is provided in Table 12 . Note that entries with
bold font represents the best entry of that column, i.e., the maximum
CCR, mean CCR and the lowest standard deviation. The stability of the
prediction capability across the intra-class variations is inversely
related to the standard deviation of the respective accuracies. Thus, a
lower standard deviation infers a more stable system across covariates.
Figure 26 compares the error associated for each covariate for different
methods. Error lines depict the standard deviation of the error taken
over the 11 views. It is evident that the GTS has improved the covariate
performance of all of the base gait templates.

The accuracy of the view estimator plays a vital role in view-invariant
recognition. The proposed view estimator is @xmath accurate in finding
the correct angle of the given gait sequences in contrast to the @xmath
proposed in Dupuis et al. ( 2013 ) . Besides, the view-dependent
classifiers are also capable of producing an applicable accuracy to
neighbouring views minimizing the error of the overall recognition.

The VI-MGR shows the highest normal condition CCR, but with a
substantially lower CCR for the clothing condition. The PGR and GLM
perform equally well with a slight trade-off in carrying condition. The
GTS with the GEI shows the best CCR in both carrying and clothing
condition with minimal trade-off in normal condition resulting in a far
superior overall performance.

The entire operation was also implemented with @xmath NN in place of
Bayes’ rule for comparison. On an average of all 11 views and 3
covariates, GTS-GEI with @xmath NN (k=1) yielded an accuracy of 94.54%
which is marginally lesser than Bayes’ rule with 95.50%.

The average time taken to run the genetic segmentation on the tuning set
was less than 5 minutes on a fourth generation Intel-i7 processor with a
13.5 GB RAM. Though GA is an evolutionary procedure, the genetic
segmentation operation was applied only once to study the
covariate-independent regions of the gait templates. The results of this
experimentation has established that only the head and feet portions of
the gait templates are required for an optimal biometric performance.
Hence, even when a different database is considered, the masks that are
computed from CASIA-B can be applied to it provided the corresponding
view and template size are the same. Should the masks be reconfigured
for a different angle or resolution, the sequential optimization of
@xmath and @xmath can be applied as described in Section 20.2 without
the need to execute the GA. The average time taken to run the sequential
optimization operation on the tuning set using the same machine was less
than 30 seconds.

### 21 Summary

Template-based gait recognition methods are found to be more successful
if the covariate-independent features are extracted. Choudhury &
Tjahjadi ( 2015 ) selected the foot-portion based on predefined
knowledge of the human-body; Dupuis et al. ( 2013 ) selected the masking
region through features selected by Random Forests classifier while Rida
et al. ( 2016 ) employed GLM to do the same.

The proposed method used the genetic algorithm to automate robust region
segmentation and hence termed to be genetic template segmentation. The
GTS was applied on three popular gait templates, namely GEI, GEnI, and
AEI. The GEI performs better than the other template representation when
treated with the GTS.

The traditional gait recognition methods employ @xmath NN for
classification. The findings of this chapter shows that Bayes’ rule can
perform equal to or even better than the @xmath NN classifier given that
the features are preprocessed by CDA, i.e., PCA followed by LDA (MDA).

The GTS forms a separate mask for each of the possible views in the
gallery. A view estimator is designed to determine the angle of
reception to know which mask to use. The overall results clearly depict
that the proposed GTS method outperforms the existing methods in
literature.

## Chapter \thechapter Gait Authentication Using Multiperson Signature
Mapping

### 22 Introduction

The recognition task that is set up for most of the currently
implemented systems involves the mapping of a given gait sequence to an
identity corresponding to the closest match to the gallery set ( Liang
et al. , 2016 ; Chattopadhyay et al. , 2015 ; Marín-Jiménez et al. ,
2015 ) . This process cannot be applied directly in the case of
authentication as unauthorized subjects may or may not be part of the
gallery set, i.e., it can be a complete outsider unknown to the system.
One is said to be authorized if the system identifies the subject as the
identity the subject claims to be.

An authentication (or verification) system that relies purely on gait
features and Euclidean threshold alone may not be the most secure
system; an impersonator can be mapped on to any one of the authorized
persons provided the gallery set is sufficiently large. That is, the
level of security associated with such a system varies inversely with
the number of authenticated users. To address this shortcoming,
supplementary features are incorporated to improve the robustness of
gait authentication systems. Ntantogian et al. ( 2015 ) express the
effectiveness of combining both gait properties of the user and a
physical authentication token possessed by the user for authentication.

Recent approaches on video-analytic gait authentication show excellent
results, but their implementations are threshold-based which trade off a
set amount of FAR (false acceptance rate) to produce an acceptable FRR
(false rejection rate). The proposed Multiperson Signature Mapping (MSM)
approach overcomes this drawback with a design that makes the FAR
independent from the FRR. The state-of-the-art algorithms mostly prefer
the @xmath NN classifier where the Euclidean distance calculated from
the extracted feature hyperplane is taken as the closeness measure. This
chapter proves that the Bayes’ rule applied over the extracted feature
set provides a much better performance compared to the conventional
@xmath NN approach. The MSM is applied on top of template-based gait
recognition algorithms to produce an efficient gait authentication
system. The method is evaluated on four different gait templates
including the GTS described in Chapter \thechapter . The study analyses
the performance across different clothing and carrying conditions over
multiple views. Experimental results with the CASIA-B gait database
depict the potential of the proposed approach.

### 23 State of the Art

Authentication forms a minority in gait biometric literature as most
articles focus on recognition. Occasionally, gait authentication may be
used synonymously with gait recognition ( Arora et al. , 2015 ) and vice
versa ( Boulgouris et al. , 2006 ) . Sarkar et al. ( 2005 ) was one of
the earliest to suggest a method for gait authentication as well as
recognition called the ‘baseline algorithm’. The distance between gait
instances was measured through frame-wise Tanimoto similarity of
corresponding silhouette sequences. Though the method was primitive in
nature, it was aimed at setting a benchmark through which other
algorithms can be compared along with an introduction of the “Gait
Challenge” database. Boulgouris et al. ( 2006 ) proposed an angular
transform which is applied on time-normalized silhouette sequences. When
used for authentication, their method outperformed the baseline
algorithm.

The state-of-the-art framework of gait authentication involves feature
extraction in the form of gait templates like the GEI ( Han & Bhanu ,
2006 ) , AEI ( Zhang et al. , 2010 ) and GEnI ( Bashir et al. , 2010 )
and finding the Euclidean distance between the test instance and the
closest gallery instance of the claimed identity. If this distance falls
within the set threshold, the test instance is considered authenticated
otherwise rejected as an impostor.

In addition to the gait itself, the shape of the head can also provide
useful information when used in conjunction with the spatiotemporal
analysis of the leg motion. This notion was employed by Jia et al. (
2015 ) to boost the verification rate. However, their study did not
include the effect of covariate conditions on the system performance.

### 24 Method

The general outline of the proposed framework is as illustrated in
Figure 27 . The input gait instance is given as a sequence of frames.
The frames are cropped and are used to generate a gait template. The
template features are transformed through CDA. The transformed set of
features are classified with Bayes’ rule. Finally, the authenticity is
checked through predicted signature matching.

#### 24.1 Spatiotemporal Feature Extraction

Features are extracted in the form of gait templates. The elementary
part of which are silhouettes extracted from the walking human subject.
The templates used for this chapter includes GEI, GEnI, and AEI which
are obtained as in Section 19.1 . In addition to this, the GTS as
discussed in Section 19 is also used. The study concluded that the
optimum accuracy is attained when the GEI is used as the base template.
Therefore, throughout the rest of this chapter, the GTS refers to the
GTS masking applied to the GEI gait templates.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The gait recognition model is obtained when the spatiotemporal features
are reduced through CDA and trained using the multivariate Gaussian
Bayes classifier so that given a gait template, the model can predict
the identity of the subject.

#### 24.2 Multiperson Signature Mapping

A typical gait authentication method would transform the given instance
to a feature space based on some gait template configuration, @xmath .
The transformation may include feature reduction techniques like PCA,
LDA or a combination of both. When a subject is to be authenticated, the
test instance features are transformed and compared against that of the
claimed identity in the trained model through the Euclidean distance
between them. If this distance is within the tolerable threshold, then
the subject belonging to the instance is considered authenticated.
Algorithm 1 shows the general outline of such a scheme.

Algorithm 2 MSM framework for gait authentication

A gait recognition model classifies any given instance, regardless of
whether registered or unregistered, to one among the trained identities.
The MSM gait authentication framework converts the gait recognition
model to one that can be used for gait authentication. Two inputs are
passed through the system: the test gait sequence and the claiming
identity reference. The classifier would label the test sequence to one
of its identities based on the input gait features alone and would
consider the instance ‘authenticated’ only if the output label matches
the claimed identity reference as illustrated in Algorithm 2 . Although
it seems simple, this technique is highly effective in practice.

The object T_model encapsulates the classifier trained for the template
@xmath as well as the necessary configurations to extract template
@xmath and corresponding PCA and LDA transformation parameters for
dimensionality reduction. The primary strength of this technique is
derived from the correct classification rate of the recognition module
and population of registered authenticated users in the system.

A theoretical derivation of the FRR and FAR of the system justifies the
applicability of the proposed framework over the existing one. Let
@xmath be a random number that represents the identity trained in the
system. Let @xmath and @xmath be discrete random variables that denote
the identity predicted by the classifier and the actual identity of the
subject respectively. The true acceptance rate or precision @xmath of
the authentication system can be represented by Bayes’ theorem as

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (4)
  -- -------- -- -----

The data provided for training for a biometric system does not contain
any skew, i.e., the training instances are provided per subject are
equally distributed during both training and testing phase. This
condition would make the probabilities

  -- -------- -------- -- -----
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath               (5)
  -- -------- -------- -- -----

By definition, @xmath is the CCR of the recognition system. The FRR of
the authentication system can hence be derived as follows.

  -- -- -------- -- -----
        @xmath      
        @xmath      
        @xmath      (6)
  -- -- -------- -- -----

Assume that any unauthorized identity is equally likely to be accepted
as one of @xmath authorized identities trained in the system (false
acceptance). This assumption would lead to the FRR being represented as

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (7)
  -- -------- -- -----

The resulting average error rate of the authentication system can hence
be calculated as

  -- -- -------- -- -----
        @xmath      (8)
        @xmath      (9)
  -- -- -------- -- -----

Equation 9 accounts for the theoretical error of the authentication
system. This will be experimentally verified in the next section with
the empirical error through Equation 8 the next section. The strength of
this technique lies in the FAR (Equation 7 ). This would mean that the
FAR is inversely proportional to the number of members registered in the
system.

#### 24.3 Two-pass Variation of MSM for GTS

The fitness function in the GTS template is designed to have a minor
trade-off in normal walk accuracy to minimize errors associated with the
covariate factors. The fitness function was initially given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where CCR @xmath is the accuracy for covariate condition @xmath ; A
being normal walk, B for carrying condition and C for clothing
variation. However, the GEI provides the best normal walk CCR compared
to all known templates but with the worst covariate CCR. To bring the
best of both templates, a two-pass variant of the MSM framework is
proposed in this study.

The two-pass MSM would require predictions from two templates. If the
claimed identity of the subject matches any one of the two predictions,
then the subject is considered authenticated. This technique will bring
the FRR of the system for each covariate factor down to the least of
that pertaining to the given templates. This implementation is
essentially an ensemble in which one template classifier would cover the
probable misclassifications of the other. To maximize the effectiveness
of this method, the GTS masks are recomputed to maximize the covariate
recognition accuracy without the special regard for the normal walk
accuracy. The new fitness function weighs each covariate equally as
given by the following equation.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

### 25 Results & Discussion

#### 25.1 Dataset Configuration

The dataset is formulated from the CASIA-B gait database Yu et al. (
2006 ) to evaluate the robustness against covariate factors. It is
composed of gait sequences from 124 subjects. This experimentation makes
use of all its covariates: normal walk (SetA), walk while carrying a bag
(SetB), and walk while wearing an overcoat (SetC). The set of the first
four instances of normal walk, SetA1, is used for training and the set
of the other two instances, SetA2, is used for testing. All 11 views in
the database are considered. Thus a total of @xmath gait sequences are
used for experimentation.

For the setup for authentication, both authorized and unauthorized
members are required. Hence, 100 randomly selected subjects are assumed
as authorized members forming the member set D @xmath . The remaining 24
subjects form the member set D @xmath and are considered unauthorized.
In the authentication testing session, members of D @xmath use their own
id number as their claiming identity and each member of D @xmath
randomly assume an id of D @xmath as their claiming identity. In
practice, to keep the process unobtrusive, the subject can provide the
claimed identity for authentication in the form of an NFC (near-field
communication, e.g., as part of the employee’s ID card). The assignment
of false identities is done subject to the constraint that each member
of D @xmath shall assume at least one but no more than two IDs of D
@xmath so that there is a total of 100 forged attempts. This mapping
ensures that there is an equal number of positives (genuine members) and
negatives (impostors) for each testing session and each covariate.

Instances of SetA1 @xmath D @xmath alone is used for the training phase.
During the test for authentication, all instances of SetA2, SetB and
SetC are used which includes both D @xmath and D @xmath . This leads to
a total of 400 test cases (200 positives and 200 negatives) for each
covariate set for a given view angle.

#### 25.2 Threshold Method vs. MSM

The conventional gait authentication system uses a nearest neighbour
model that contains the transformed features of all members of the
training set that pertains to the registered subjects. The transform
that is used here is also CDA, i.e., PCA followed by LDA. Applying the
same feature transformation for both threshold-based and MSM frameworks
facilitate in an effective comparison between them.

The traditional method involves fixing a threshold which controls the
trade-off between the FAR and FRR. It is evaluated using ROC curves
where the verification rate (sensitivity; @xmath ) is plotted against
the FAR. The performance of the gait templates over the threshold-based
framework is shown in Figure 28 with the error rates as averages across
all three covariates: SetA2, SetB and SetC. As all templates discussed
in this article show superior normal walk performance, the average
accuracy over all covariates is considered to plot the ROC curves so
that the difference in the overall performance can be illustrated.

The usual convention is to compare the point where the FAR and FRR
becomes the same and is known as the EER: equal error rate. The MSM
framework does not include a variable threshold to obtain an EER. Hence
to compare the performance of MSM and threshold-based methods, the
optimum AER is calculated. This value corresponds to the combination of
FRR and FAR which yields the minimum possible AER for the specific
threshold-based authentication scheme. The optimal AER would not exceed
the EER of the same system.

In the MSM framework, for a given gait template, a PCA-LDA-Bayes
classifier is with the features of the registered members. The
classification was done with the help of Scikit-Learn package in Python
( Pedregosa et al. , 2011 ) . The performances of both threshold-based
and MSM for the four mentioned templates are as shown in Table 13 and
graphically compared in Figure 29 . From these results, it can be
observed that the classification through Bayes’ rule has minimized the
FRR. The verification rate ( @xmath ) is found to be equal to the CCR of
the classifier as depicted in Equation 24.2 . Also, the FAR is plummeted
to an average of 1% across all templates proving Equation 7 . That is,
the number of authentic members registered (trained) in the system is
@xmath leading to an FAR of @xmath . This implies that AER as given in
Equation 9 holds true for the MSM framework.

#### 25.3 Types of FAR

There are fundamentally two types of impostors who try to gain access to
the system. Type 1 impostors are those who are unknown to the system and
claim the identity of a member who is registered in the system. Type 2
impostors are those whose real identities are registered in the system
but attempt to claim the identity of another member of the same system.
The test set for type 2 impostors consists of the IDs of each member of
SetA2 @xmath D @xmath shuffled such that none would receive their
original ID. This leads to an additional 200 negative samples for each
covariate factor.

Type 2 errors are close to negligible in the MSM framework, provided the
base classifier used for the recognition be sufficiently accurate. For a
type 2 impostor to succeed, his/her identity true identity must be
mispredicted by the base classifier, and the mispredicted value should
match the false identity that he/she claims to be. In theory, if the
misprediction rate of the classifier is given by @xmath , and there are
@xmath members registered in the system, the probable type two error is
@xmath . This effect can be observed in Table 16 . In a threshold-based
system, a type 2 impostor is treated no different from a typical type 1
impostor as the same Euclidean threshold plays its role. However, the
design of the MSM framework makes type 2 impostors close to
non-existent.

#### 25.4 Covariate Factors and GTS-2P

Covariate factors play a vital role in both recognition and
authentication. Figure 30 depicts the AER for each template observed
through the MSM framework. Clothing variations are known to decrease the
performance of gait biometric system substantially ( Marín-Jiménez
et al. , 2015 ) . This phenomenon can be noted in all three of the base
templates, GEI, GEnI and AEI. The GTS was designed to circumvent this
problem but with a little trade-off in normal condition error. This
setback of the GTS is nullified when coupled with the GEI in the
two-pass MSM variation, GTS-2P.

In GTS-2P, two classifiers are used, one trained with the GEI templates
and one with the GTS templates. When one or both of these templates
predict an ID that matches the claimed ID of the subject, then the
subject is assumed accepted. As stated in Section 24.2 , the true
acceptance rate or verification rate is treated as the precision of the
classifier considering ‘accept’ to be a positive label. When the final
prediction of the ensemble is given by the logical OR of the input
binary classifiers, then the precision shall be no lesser than any of
the classifiers in the ensemble. That is, the FRR of each covariate can
either be the minimum of the two classifiers or even lesser than both.
This effect is what can be observed in Figure 30 ; the normal AER is
slightly better in GTS-2P ( @xmath ) than that of the GEI ( @xmath ).
Similarly, the GTS-2P coat AER ( @xmath ) is marginally better than that
of the original GTS ( @xmath ). However the improvement observed in the
carrying condition (bag) is much more pronounced in GTS-2P ( @xmath )
than the original GTS ( @xmath ). This is because the GTS masks were
recomputed to favor the all conditions equally for the two pass
variation. The difference in the normal and clothing conditions seem
negligible due to the pitfall with multiple passes which increases the
FAR. For each pass, the impostor subject is given an extra chance to
slip through the system. Thus, increasing the number of passes by two
theoretically doubles the FAR of the system. This is also the reason why
the number of passes was limited to just two in the study and we did not
consider formulating an ensemble that merges the predictions of all
possible templates. As the theoretical FAR of the one-pass MSM was only
1%, the increase towards an FAR of 2% does not weigh against the
significant decrease in FRR, and in terms, the overall AER. That is, the
AER of MSM on the original GTS is @xmath while that of GTS-2P is @xmath

#### 25.5 Spoofing Attacks and Limitations

The strength of gait biometrics is often questioned. It is considered
possible for people to imitate the body language of another and hence
gait as well. This assumption drives the argument that gait
authentication systems are vulnerable to spoofing attacks which lead to
the following questions:

1.   To which extent can one’s gait be spoofed in a biometric system?

2.   Can spoof attacks increase the theoretical FAR of the MSM?

To test a system for authentication, both genuine and impostor gaits are
required. The impostors ought to ideally attempt to impersonate the gait
of the identities they claim. The public datasets available do not
conform to this requirement as of yet, so methods in literature adopt
random assignment of genuine identities to random impostors of the same
dataset. Hence, those who wish to study the effect of spoofing are
required to compile their dataset with true impersonators who try to
imitate the gait of genuine members they claim.

A natural gait is a walking style adopted by a person to balance the
body and at the same time provide locomotion. Many factors come to play
when one’s natural gait is observed:

1.   Physical proportions

2.   Weight distribution

3.   Metabolism

Apart from the above there are also covariate factors (Section 9.5 ). To
completely spoof one’s gait, the attacker should conform to at least the
physical proportions of the target concerned, and match the weight
distribution to a degree. A simple scenario of spoofing is shown in
Figure 31 .

Gafurov et al. ( 2007 ) were the first to do a comprehensive analysis on
spoofing attack on gait authentication. Their study included 100 members
and was based on wearable sensors. The results concluded that gait
imitation with minimal effort shows negligible change in the EER.
Despite that, those with an in-depth knowledge of their target’s gait
and with closer body proportions are found pose a significant threat to
the authentication system. Mjaaland et al. ( 2010 ) studied gait
spoofing with 50 subjects and found that each individual had a plateau
which is the limit to which they can mimic the natural gait of another
person. Their study concluded that spoofing one’s gait is a highly
non-trivial task.

However, the experiments of both Gafurov et al. ( 2007 ) and Mjaaland
et al. ( 2010 ) included only a single sensor attached to the hip (belt)
of the subjects studied. The findings of Geradts et al. ( 2002 ) shown
that the foot angle is a much greater indicator of gait than the hip
angle. Unless the system draws data explicitly from a sensor attached to
the feet, the foot angles cannot be inferred.

A video gait template-based system inherently records the foot angle of
the subjects under observation. Nevertheless, as most appearance-based
templates rely largely on the shape of the subjects, attackers with
similar build and clothing conditions as the target can spoof the system
( Hadid et al. , 2013 ) .

##### Possibility of spoofing in a biometric system

The extent to which one’s gait can be spoofed lies in the design of the
gait biometric system. If the algorithm is largely based on shape
features, the video-based gait biometric system is vulnerable to
spoofing attacks. This weakness is only a concern if the attacker is of
the same build and trained specifically to mimic the gait of the target
subject. On the contrary, the system is more secure if it gives a
greater weight to spatiotemporal features. Note that this notion does
not hold for soft biometrics where shape features play a vital role in
the objective function. Mjaaland et al. ( 2010 ) observed that the more
the subjects practice to mimic the gait of their target, the more that
some tend to underperform in their attempt. The reduction in spoofing
efficiency results from arrhythmic patterns adopted by the attacker due
to excessive caution.

##### Effect of spoof attacks on the theoretical FAR of the MSM

As far as the GTS features are concerned, the answer to the question,
“Can spoof attacks increase the theoretical FAR of the MSM?” , is no.
This is because the GTS template covers only the head shape and
inclination and the spatiotemporal features of the foot region. Thus the
reliance on shape features are minimal and nullifies the effect of
spoofing attacks. A person may be able to mimic the arm swing and stride
length and body inclinations to a certain limit (as determined by the
plateau), but one cannot accurately reproduce the foot angle of a
natural gait of another human. Moreover, the CDA feature transformation
maps the input instances to confined regions. For an attacker, this
mapping is unpredictable. Even a small deviation in some of the features
of the instance may cause wider deviations in the CDA feature space.
This means that the attacker’s gait instance can be mapped to any one of
the regions formed by the @xmath trained identities with equal
probability. Thus the theoretical FAR of the MSM algorithm still remains
@xmath .

##### Limitation of the MSM

The proposed MSM is proven to be a much better framework for gait
authentication than the conventional threshold-based authentication
methods. FAR rising from type 2 imposters are close to zero and the type
1 FAR scales inversely to the system population ( @xmath ). However,
when the system consists of only a few members, its greatest strength
becomes its weakness. This would mean that the impostor has a much
greater chance to be mapped to the person whom he claims to be. In such
situations where the number of authentic subjects is minimal, it is
recommended that the members who are not part of the authority also have
their gait signatures registered in the system, but they need not be
granted the same access possessed by the authorized registered members.
This will ensure that the system population is large enough to maintain
an acceptable FAR.

### 26 Summary

Gait recognition is a mapping of input instance to an identity whereas
gait authentication is the problem of verifying whether the given
instance belongs to the claimed identity. The state-of-the-art
implementations of gait authentication use thresholds based on Euclidean
nearest neighbour distance. A Euclidean threshold is empirically set
depending on the trade-off between FAR and FRR.

The proposed method, MSM, eliminates the need of a threshold by
implementing a random signature mapping technique for a system of
multiple subjects. In MSM, a genuine gait instance is more likely to be
mapped to the claimed identity while an impostor is more liable to be
mapped on to a different identity. The MSM outperforms the Euclidean NN
systems over the same template features and preprocessing steps provided
the system population be sufficiently large.

A gait authentication system can become vulnerable to spoofing attacks
if the algorithm imposes a higher dependency on shape-based features.
However, when the GEI-GTS features are employed, the reliance on
shape-based features is reduced and a greater weight is given to
temporal deviations of the foot angle. Moreover, the foot angle is found
to be the best discriminative parameter for a gait biometric system
according to Geradts et al. ( 2002 ) .

As the MSM derives its strength from the system population, its
efficiency will decrease if the number of registered members in the
system is considerably low. Artificially increasing the system
population by registering new members who do not claim access would
theoretically increase the performance of MSM.

## Chapter \thechapter Gait Authentication Using Bayesian Thresholding

### 27 Introduction

Although the MSM has proven its worth as a much more reliable
authentication framework over the conventional methods, it suffers from
a drawback when the system population is smaller. For instance, the
results in previous chapter is based on a dataset with a system
population of registered members as @xmath , this caused the FAR to be
@xmath , which is 1%. If the system population is small as 10, then the
FAR would be as bad as 10%, which means that there is a chance of one in
ten that the impostor can get mapped on to the region of the claimed
identity. This brings the need to an even better framework that is
effective even when the number of registered members is low.

This chapter projects the extension to the MSM using probability as a
threshold, namely, Bayesian posterior probability, but it does not rely
on the Euclidean distance threshold like the existing implementations.
That is, once the features are extracted, their posterior probability
with respect to the claimed identity is calculated. If this probability
is higher than the assigned threshold probability, the test instance is
said to be authenticated. This threshold would provide the means to
separate genuine members from impostors even if they get mapped on to
the same region. This method is compared with the MSM with identical
conditions to illustrate the difference in performance between them.
Just like the MSM, the Bayesian thresholding method is also a paradigm
that can be applied to any feature representation.

### 28 Mapping of Instances to Regions

LDA transforms the feature space of the instances so that the instances
of the same class is packed closer together. This compaction creates
clusters that are separated from each other with well-defined
boundaries. These boundaries cannot be easily visualized as the feature
space spans to multiple dimensions. For instance, the result of LDA
after PCA (i.e., CDA) for the GTS (in Section 20 ) reached up to 99
discriminant features for each gait template.

An illustration of the LDA mapping is shown in Figure 32 . Only two
discriminant features, @xmath and @xmath , are included in this example
for a simple illustration. Assume that this is the transformation that
resulted from applying CDA to the GEI-GTS template representation of
SetA1 of the CASIA-B dataset used for the training phase. Each item in
the plot represents a gait instance and there are four instances per
person registered in the system. The lines depict the boundaries formed
as a result of this feature transformation.

When a gait instance of a registered member is provided as input, the
transformed instance is more likely to be mapped to the region that
confines the features that correspond to the member. In case 1 of Figure
32 , the authentic (genuine) member is mapped to his respective region,
the claimed identity matches the identity of the region mapped, and
hence considered authorized.

Let us then consider the case of a type 2 impostor, that is, a
registered member claiming the identity of another member. A type 2
impostor (case 2 in Figure 32 ) is a registered member who tries to pose
as another in the system. As a registered member, a type 2 impostor
would already have a signature region in the discriminant feature space.
Hence he/she is more likely to be mapped to his/her respective region.
Therefore, the system would recognize that this member is an impostor as
the claimed identity will not match the identity returned (according to
MSM).

Consider the case of a type 1 impostor. In a system where the population
of registered members is considerably large (greater than 100), the
adversary who attempts to claim the identity of a known user is more
likely to be mapped to a random location in the discriminant feature
space (case 3). In this case, the claimed and returned identities would
not match and the impostor would be detected by the MSM system. However,
in a system where lesser number of members are registered, then it is
more likely for the adversary to be mapped on to the region that
correspond to the claimed identity (case 4). In such a case, the MSM
system would fail.

The solution to this problem proposed in this chapter would be to use
Bayesian probability as a threshold. Bayesian probability would be more
robust than the Euclidean nearest neighbour threshold as Bayes’ rule is
optimal when used in conjunction with LDA ( Hamsici & Martinez , 2008 )
. This will make sure that the system performance is not adversely
affected by the system population.

### 29 Method

A simple outline of the proposed method is as shown in Figure 33 . The
dataset is composed of gait feature templates which are divided into
gallery and probe sets. The gallery proceeds through feature reduction
after which the priors and likelihood of the feature space are
calculated. The transformation vectors produced by the feature reduction
process are used to apply the same on the probe set. The probe subjects
are authenticated by the inferring the posterior probability from the
calculated priors and likelihood.

#### 29.1 Gait Feature Extraction

The same gait template feature representations explained in Section 24.1
is also used in this chapter for experimentation. The feature templates
include GEI, GEnI, AEI, and GTS applied to GEI. Samples of the above
templates for a single subject are illustrated in Figure 34 for
different covariate conditions of the CASIA-B database.

#### 29.2 Bayesian Thresholding

A classifier based on the probabilistic generative model models the
posterior probability for all classes of the system ( Bishop , 2006 ) .
Examples of generative models include HMM, Bayes classifier, and Markov
random fields. Although the problem at hand is not a classification
problem per se , this property can be exploited to utilize this
classifier as a tool for authentication. The Bayes classifier is one
such model that works efficiently with LDA.

Let @xmath be the total number of features (dimensions) in a feature
vector and @xmath be the identity for a subject, @xmath . A subject with
gait features @xmath who is to be authenticated ought to conform to the
identity claimed @xmath with a sufficiently high posterior probability
@xmath . This relation is given by the Bayes’ rule as follows.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The subject is said to accepted only when @xmath , where @xmath is the
threshold probability ( @xmath ) that is to be empirically estimated.
The likelihood, @xmath , is calculated through a multivariate Gaussian
distribution @xmath . The expression for the probability density
function of the Gaussian likelihood is given in Section 19.2 .

It is theoretically sufficient to use only the likelihood as the
probability threshold in place of the posterior probability. However, it
is experimentally observed that this causes the decision boundary to be
extremely sensitive making locating the optimal threshold difficult.
Hence using just the likelihood would not be applicable for the purpose
of authentication.

Algorithm 1 BT-based gait authentication

A simple description of the Bayesian thresholding (BT) for gait
authentication is depicted in Algorithm 1 . In a nutshell, the supplied
gait instance is transformed according to a template configuration,
@xmath . The posterior probability, prob (based on the Gaussian
likelihood) of the claimed identity given the transformed feature
instance, @xmath is calculated. The instance is considered authentic
only when this value is greater than @xmath . Thus the threshold
probability, @xmath can be thought of as the minimum posterior
probability required to reject the given instance.

#### 29.3 Two-pass Variation of BT for GTS

The performance of the GEI is ideal in normal conditions while the
GTS-GEI is optimal in covariate conditions. Hence, when the predictions
of both of these templates are taken into account, a better
authentication system can be obtained. Consider an ensemble consisting
of two authentication systems, S @xmath and S @xmath , where S @xmath
uses a model which is trained with the GEI templates and that of S
@xmath is trained with the GTS-GEI templates (GEI with GTS masking). The
test gait instance is considered authenticated as its claimed identity
if any one of the systems, S @xmath or S @xmath , accepts it. That is,
the instance is rejected only if it is rejected by both systems of the
ensemble. This process is called the two-pass variation for the GTS
(GTS-2P). The steps are illustrated in Algorithm 2 . Both @xmath and
@xmath are empirically set thresholds.

Preconditions:

S @xmath is trained with @xmath configuration

S @xmath is trained with @xmath configuration

Algorithm 2 Two-pass BT for gait authentication

The two-pass variation for BT is slightly different to the one explained
in Section 24.3 for MSM. The MSM does not have any threshold to tune so
the application is straight-forward. In BT, each template representation
has a different threshold range. Therefore, a common threshold cannot be
used to tune the error rates of the authentication system. The
conclusion drawn from Section 25.4 shows that though this operation
decreases the FRR of the system, it increases the FAR. This result
entails that the two-pass variation combines not only the strengths of
both systems, but also their weaknesses. As the increase in FAR is
inevitable in this variation, it is minimized for each individual system
such that the consolidate FAR of the ensemble is optimal. The thresholds
for both S @xmath and S @xmath are tuned towards 1% FAR for an easier
comparison with MSM ⁴ ⁴ 4 The theoretical FAR of the MSM system is also
1% for system population, @xmath . .

### 30 Results & Evaluation

#### 30.1 Dataset Configuration

The dataset configuration used in the previous chapter assumed a simple
scenario where impostors claim random registered identities. In this
section, a slightly different configuration is adopted to clearly study
the strength of the Bayesian thresholding system compared to the MSM.

As in Section 25.1 , the members of the dataset is divided into two
sets, D @xmath and D @xmath . Member set D @xmath assumes 100 authorized
members where the remaining 24 are assumed as unauthorized members D
@xmath . This time, each member ( @xmath ) of D @xmath tries all
possible identities of D @xmath for type 1 impersonation. As for type 2,
each member of D @xmath claims the identity of every other member of D
@xmath other than the identity owned. Just as before, only instances
(say @xmath ) of SetA1 @xmath D @xmath is used for training and the rest
for testing. For each covariate, the sum of positive cases is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

while that of negative cases for type 1 attackers and type 2 attackers
are respectively

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This formulation is specifically done to study the effect of FAR in
detail.

#### 30.2 Performance Comparison with NN Threshold

Conventional authentication models find the Euclidean distance in the
feature space between the test instance @xmath and the instance @xmath
of the claiming identity, @xmath . Usually, @xmath can either be

1.   A point on the multidimensional plane that represents the mean of
    the gallery instances of subject @xmath ( Sarkar et al. , 2005 )

2.   An exemplar instance of @xmath ( Kale et al. , 2004 )

3.   The instance of @xmath which is closest to @xmath , i.e., the
    nearest neighbour ( Matovski et al. , 2012 )

The third case is used for benchmark comparison for this study. This is
the same case used to compare the Euclidean threshold method with the
MSM in the previous chapter.

The improvement in performance between the NN and BT framework can be
easily noticed in their respective ROC curves. The ROC curves for each
template for both NN and BT appear as shown in Figure 35 . The error
rates shown are the average across all three covariates of the CASIA-B
database: normal, bag, and coat. The greater area under the ROC curve
for the BT shows that the proposed method performs considerably better
than the de facto Euclidean thresholds. This effect is much more
pronounced for GEI, GEnI and AEI than the GTS as the covariate-resilient
feature set of GTS causes the ROC curves of NN and BT to almost overlap.
Even so, on a closer inspection, the area under the ROC curve of BT is
still greater than that of NN for the GTS template as well.

Unlike MSM, the BT has a tunable threshold which facilitates it to have
an EER. The EER can be obtained through intersection of their respective
FAR and FRR curves. Let us limit our discussion to the AEI and the GTS ⁵
⁵ 5 GTS in here refers to the GTS mask applied to the GEI template
templates as they are the best performing templates in this experiment.
Figures 36 (a) and 36 (b) depicts the change in FAR and FRR with the
Euclidean threshold using NN. As the distance threshold, @xmath , grows
system becomes more lax allowing more intruders to slip through leading
to an increase in the FAR. However, a greater distance threshold
minimizes the FRR. On the contrary, a smaller distance threshold makes
the system stricter in evaluation thus reducing the FAR while increasing
the FRR.

The error curves for the BT in Figures 36 (c) and 36 (d) shows that the
FAR becomes negligible immediately after an extremely small change in
the threshold probability @xmath . There is also a minor margin of
difference between the point where the slope of FRR seems to saturate to
the point where it reaches 100%. The effect of probability as a
threshold is so sensitive that the EER cannot be easily visualized at a
linear scale. To get a better perception of the exact EER, the threshold
response can be viewed in log scales as shown in Figures 36 (e) and 36
(f). Notice the difference in the slopes of the curves to that of the NN
threshold. A greater probability threshold, @xmath , in here would make
the authentication system stricter causing the reduction in FAR and
increase the FRR as a consequence. The opposite effect can be observed
for a smaller value of @xmath .

The performance of each method is compared through their minimum
observable AER in addition to their EER. The results in Figure 36
includes only the performance of the sagittal angle. The experiment is
repeated for all 11 angles of the CASIA-B dataset. The results are
averaged and depicted in Figure 37 and Table 15 . The FAR and FRR are
obtained by tuning the threshold so as to minimize its AER. The values
are the mean of the respective errors over all three covariate factors
averaged over the 11 views of the CASIA-B dataset. We could infer that
BT significantly outperforms the existing Euclidean-NN-based
implementation for authentication.

The FAR depicted so far in this section is the average of both type 1
and type 2 FARs. The types of FAR is separately evaluated and compared
in Table 16 . The BT has a better type 1 FAR and far superior type 2 FAR
compared to that of NN. However, the type 1 FAR of both NN and BT using
the GTS template is marginally equal. Thus, the proposed BT exceeds in
performance in comparison with NN over all the metrics in the
evaluation.

#### 30.3 Performance Comparison with MSM

The FAR of the MSM system is @xmath where @xmath is the number of
genuine members whose gait signatures are registered in the system. This
expression was experimentally verified in Section 25.2 . To compare the
performance of BT against that of MSM, the threshold, @xmath , ought to
be tuned to match the fixed FAR of the MSM. The total number of unique
genuine members in the training set are 100, which means that the FAR of
MSM is @xmath . Therefore, @xmath is adjusted such that the FAR of BT is
also @xmath . The metric to be compared in this section is the FRR of
both methods. The FRR of both MSM and BT was obtained in this
experimental setting over all 11 angles of the CASIA-B dataset. The
resulting average for each template is as shown in Table 17 and
illustrated as a bar graph in Figure 38 . We can clearly observe that
the FRR of BT is much lesser than that of MSM for all of the templates
in the experiment.

The change in system population can largely influence the performance of
an authentication system. The main drawback that was identified in MSM
is that its performance decreases with smaller population. To verify
whether or not the BT shares the same weakness, their error rates are
compared with different sizes of system population, @xmath . For this
test, the @xmath that corresponds to the minimum AER is used for BT. The
outcome is depicted in Figure 39 and Table 18 . The BT method exhibited
a smaller AER for all values of @xmath in the experiment. Initially, the
FAR of MSM is smaller than that of BT. However, as expected, the FAR of
the MSM increased with the decrease in @xmath . The experimentation for
the GTS-2P (Figure 40 and Table 19 ) gave intriguing results where this
effect is much more adverse.

The decrease in FRR is a change that can be observed in both MSM and BT
systems in Figure 39 . This is because when lesser members are
registered in the system, there are lesser classes to discriminate as
each member is viewed as a class in the discriminant analysis. The
reduction in classes allows for a simpler boundary definition to
discriminate each member.

In the GTS-2P, the two template representations employed are GEI for
@xmath and the GEI-GTS for @xmath . Since the adversary has two chances
to enter into the system, the probability of him/her successfully
impersonating a registered member is a little less than the FAR of
@xmath and @xmath combined. The thresholds for @xmath and @xmath were
both set to reflect @xmath FAR. Thus, the FAR of GTS-2P is almost @xmath
. Looking at the effect of @xmath in GTS-2P, the AER of BT and MSM is
almost identical when @xmath ranges from 60 to 100 members. At
population values lesser than 60, the MSM began to show slightly lesser
FRR. However, BT started to outperform MSM in terms of AER when the FAR
of MSM became significantly large.

#### 30.4 Discussion

The sharp changes in sensitivity are mainly due to the compaction of
classes by LDA-Bayes’ model. The posterior probability based on the
multivariate Gaussian model encompasses the interrelation between each
feature. The boundary thus formed between each class is well-defined
according to the features of the training set ( Hamsici & Martinez ,
2008 ) . The discriminating nature of LDA causes the model to map each
probe instance to a region confined by these boundaries. An instance
that pertains to an authorized entity shall be mapped to the region of
the corresponding identity with a sufficiently high probability which
minimizes FRR, and in the same time, brings the type 2 FAR close to
zero. Consider the case of an unauthorized instance claiming the
identity of an authorized user; the probability @xmath that the model
maps this instance to the region of the claimed identity is @xmath where
@xmath is the total number of uniquely authorized subjects. For our
case, @xmath which implies that @xmath . This causes the separation of
most unauthorized subjects from their claimed identity with a
significantly large probability thus greatly reducing the FAR.
Furthermore, if the instance is mapped to the region claimed, it should
also be close enough to the other instances in that region for it to be
considered genuine which brings the FAR closer to 0% for a sufficiently
large value of @xmath .

The GTS-2P has proved to perform significantly better than its single
template counterpart for MSM (for @xmath ). However, as far as the BT
method is concerned, it does not give a significant improvement in
performance. Though in BT, the experimental error rates of GTS-2P is
marginally smaller than that of the single template system, the
difference is not compelling enough to establish its use over the
simpler BT framework.

The method proposed is neither a feature extraction technique nor a new
classifier but a novel authentication paradigm making it flexible to
cope with future advancements. This would mean that BT can be applied to
any feature representation along with any generative probabilistic
classifier for a given authentication task. The method can also be
integrated to view estimators to enable a view-invariant authentication
operation.

### 31 Summary

The BT is a gait authentication framework designed to overcome the
weakness of the MSM framework. BT uses probability as a threshold in
contrast to the Euclidean distance threshold used by standard NN-based
authentication systems. Once the features are transformed through CDA,
the posterior probability of the Bayes’ rule can act as the threshold
for the decision function. The input instance is accepted as the
identity claimed if it conforms to that identity with a sufficiently
high posterior probability. This limit is determined by empirically set
threshold, @xmath .

Unlike MSM, the FAR of BT is not adversely affected by a reduction in
the number of registered members, i.e., system population. The BT can be
applied to any system population with a considerably low AER. The two
pass variation can also be applied to BT similar to MSM, however, it
does not provide a significant increase in performance.

The proposed framework BT can be applied to any type of gait
authentication system regardless of the feature representation used. The
experimental results show that it is far superior to the de facto NN
distance method and the MSM framework.

## Chapter \thechapter Conclusions and Future Work

To this end, the objective of this thesis has been to develop robust
algorithms to employ gait in both soft and hard biometrics. Each of the
proposed methods was implemented and evaluated with the widely used
CASIA-B dataset, and compared with prescribed test conditions in
literature and found to outperform their existing counterparts. The
conclusions drawn from the study with regard to the proposed methods are
as follows.

A novel approach for gait-based gender recognition was proposed called
Pose-Based Voting. While existing approaches for this problem assess the
entire gait as a single spatiotemporal instance, the proposed method
views each frame of the video as individual instances. The existing
gender recognition techniques make use of only a single gait cycle
regardless of the length of the gait sequence fed as input. On the other
hand, the accuracy of PBV increases with the length of the given gait
sequence as it makes use of all of the frames containing the gait of the
subject under observation. This technique also has the ability to cope
with possible occlusion and partially observed gait cycles with minimal
loss in overall prediction accuracy.

Two different feature representations were proposed in this dissertation
for gender recognition through gait, viz., Elliptic Fourier descriptors
and row-column sum vectors. EFD is a chain encoding technique used in
computer graphics. It was selected for this problem as it can describe
the shape of any closed contour with a set of equations. The
coefficients of these equations can be encoded as a feature vector of a
specified length for any input shape. The EFD performed well for gender
recognition along the sagittal plane, but was not well enough to match
the performance of the state-of-the-art solutions. However, a simpler
row-column sum was found to be more effective in representing the
horizontal and vertical structural features of the subject, thus
outperforming the state of the art.

The outcome of the PBV experiment showed that it is possible to neglect
the temporal aspect of gait while analysing soft biometric information
like gender. This was achieved with the aggregation of predictions.
Individually, each frame by itself may not suffice to provide a precise
classification of gender. However, with a set of frames, a better
consensus can be arrived by taking prediction of each frame into
account. The study has also proved that Bayes’ rule could be used as an
alternative to the widely used SVM when the feature set is reduced
through LDA to provide identical results.

Many gait templates have been proposed over the past decade with each
successive template addressing some weakness of the previously
established templates for gait recognition. Recent advancements
suggested to split templates to extract only the relevant features that
are invariant to covariate factors such as clothing style and carrying
conditions. However, such segmentation measures mostly relied on the
predefined knowledge of the human body. To achieve the peak performance
of any gait template, a novel segmentation technique, called the GTS,
was proposed to find the optimal regions of the gait template. The
boundary selection parameters of this method were handled by the genetic
algorithm while CDA was used for feature extraction. The mask thus
produced made the template robust to covariate factors.

In practical conditions, a person in an open space can be observed at
any angle. The slope-based view-estimator designed in this thesis was
found be more efficient while being computationally inexpensive. It is
interesting to note that just two variables is sufficient to estimate
the view of observation. This technique is found to be more accurate
than the existing implementations with complicated steps for the same
objective. Coupled with the view estimator, the GTS has proven to be a
highly efficient view-invariant gait recognition model.

The MSM is a novel framework designed for authentication to overcome the
trade-off between FAR and FAR that exists in the de facto Euclidean
distance-based threshold methods. The algorithm extends a gait
recognition model to be used for authentication. To simply put, if the
recognition system returns the identity as claimed by the subject, then
he/she is said to be accepted as a genuine user. This technique relies
on the strength of the recognition system and the number of genuine
members registered in the system, i.e., the system population. The FAR
of this framework scales inversely with the system population and the
FRR became equal to the CCR of the base recognition system. Though the
MSM framework was proven to be successful, its performance is suppressed
in lower system population.

To overcome the weakness of MSM, a new paradigm was designed to use the
Bayesian posterior probability as a threshold in place of the NN-based
Euclidean threshold. The resulting model exhibited a significant
improvement in performance. Unlike the Euclidean threshold, the Bayes’
rule with the multivariate Gaussian likelihood function takes the
relationship between the variables considered. Moreover, Bayes’ rule is
found to be optimal after LDA. The CDA feature transformation applied to
the gait templates ends with LDA. Hence, the Bayesian threshold
performed far superior to the existing distance-based threshold methods
for gait authentication. The method has also surpassed the limitation of
the MSM concerning the system population.

The PBV gender recognition produces an ideal accuracy while all of the
other aforementioned models – GTS, MSM, and Bayesian thresholding – are
flexible. That is, they can work on top of any feature extraction
procedure and any classifier. This would mean that even when a new
template or classifier model is invented to surpass the ones discussed
in this research, applying the proposed paradigms would only yield a
much better performance than what it could yield with the existing
framework. This characteristic would facilitate these algorithms to cope
with future advancements.

The EFD is visually more expressive than the RCS. It could prove to be
better than other feature representations when the subjects under
consideration are observed at an oblique angle. All of the recent
gait-based gender recognition algorithms published so far considers only
the sagittal angle. Hence an in-depth study of gait at oblique angles
ought to be conducted in future for both hard and soft biometrics to
further gauge the capabilities of the EFD.

The Bayesian probability thresholding had proven itself to be far
superior to the Euclidean distance-based thresholding in gait
authentication. This theory can also be extended to other modes of
authentication. Hence, we can test the BT method against other existing
authentication algorithms such as handwritten signature verification,
fingerprint verification, iris recognition, and face-based
authentication.

Gait stratification is an unexplored area in gait analysis. It is a way
of grouping people by means of their gait. The feature extraction for
this problem would not be the same as that for a biometric. That is, the
objective is not to extract the identifying characteristics but that of
which can pertain to a group – a set that blurs between hard and soft
biometric features. That is, it is more general than hard biometrics and
more specific than soft biometrics. It could provide new insights on the
relationship between gait and human behaviour and give rise to unseen
inferences.
