## Introduction

e1]1

Symmetries play a very important role in the construction of the
fundamental theories that we have in physics nowadays. Examples of that
are the general relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics,
just to name a few. In this Thesis, we study hidden symmetries that
control nontrivial aspects of classical dynamics, as well as spectral
peculiarities in quantum and supersymmetric quantum mechanics models.

From a classical mechanics perspective, Noether’s theorem reveals that
behind the invariance of action under a symmetry transformation, there
exists a conservation law. In general, the principle of least action
assumes the existence of a Lagrangian @xmath , which in mechanics
depends on the generalized coordinates and its velocities.
Geometrically, these coordinates belong to a configuration space @xmath
, which points are usually denoted by @xmath , and their associated
velocities are vectors that live on the tangent space @xmath at @xmath ,
which in turns, are generated by the action of a particular tangent
vector field. Then, naturally the Lagrangian is a function on the
tangent bundle @xmath of @xmath [ Nakahara ( 2003 ); Sundermeyer ( 2014
) ] . In this framework, symmetry is a one-parametric transformation
generated by some conserved vector field. To compare transformations
associated with two different vector fields, say @xmath and @xmath , we
compute the Lie derivative ¹ ¹ 1 The Lie derivative evaluates the change
of a tensor field (including scalar functions, vector fields and
one-forms), along the flow defined by another vector field [ Nakahara (
2003 ) ] . of @xmath along the flow of @xmath , denoted by @xmath , and
it is not difficult to show that this operation reduces to the usual
commutator between two vector fields @xmath . This gives rise to a Lie
algebra of vector fields on @xmath [ Nakahara ( 2003 ) ] .

On the other hand, when we go to the Hamiltonian formalism, the
dynamical variables considered now are the generalized coordinates and
their canonical momenta @xmath . One can show that under a general
change of coordinates, @xmath transform as the components of a vector in
the cotangent space @xmath at @xmath [ Nakahara ( 2003 ) ] . Then the
phase space is naturally identified with the cotangent bundle @xmath
with local coordinates @xmath on it [ Arnold et al. ( 1989 ); Nakahara (
2003 ); Sundermeyer ( 2014 ) ] . Here, the symplectic form @xmath
encodes the Poisson bracket structure. Namely, with a given function
@xmath on the phase space, a Hamiltonian vector field,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is associated, such that the contraction @xmath . For two Hamiltonian
vector fields @xmath and @xmath , it follows then that @xmath and @xmath
. If @xmath is identified as the Hamiltonian of the system, then the
last relation corresponds to the equation of motion for @xmath [ Arnold
et al. ( 1989 ); Sundermeyer ( 2014 ) ] . In this formalism, a symmetry
transformation is a flow produced by a Hamiltonian vector field whose
generating function in phase space is conserved in time.

As it is known, the Lie algebra mentioned above corresponds to a more
abstract concept. A Lie group is a smooth manifold with an additional
group structure, and any Lie group gives rise to a Lie algebra, which is
its tangent space at the identity [ Nakahara ( 2003 ); Gilmore ( 2006 )
] . When a group “acts” on some target space (that could be the same
group manifold), an explicit form of its elements is required. This
leads us to the representation theory. In Hamiltonian classical
mechanics, the target space is @xmath , the Lie algebra generators are
identified with the Hamiltonian vector fields, and the group action
corresponds to Hamiltonian flows. In the case of quantum theory, we
look, in accordance with the celebrated Wigner theorem [ Wigner ( 1931 ,
2012 ); Weinberg ( 1995 ) ] , for irreducible unitary representations of
the quantum symmetry group of the system, and target space is the
Hilbert space generated by eigenstates of the quantum Hamiltonian
operator. In fact, the “algebraic” approach claims that the entire
Hilbert space can be generated by the action of the symmetry operators
on an arbitrary solution of the corresponding Schrödinger equation,
i.e., the spectrum of the system is explained by symmetry.

Symmetries are intrinsic properties of the geometry that characterizes a
given manifold. Suppose we have a space-time manifold with a metric
structure @xmath . If @xmath is invariant under a certain change of
coordinates, we have an “isometry”, which in accordance with the
discussion above, is generated by a particular vector field, called
Killing vector field [ Nakahara ( 2003 ) ] . We can ask for mechanical
systems that respect the isometries of the space-time where they live,
that gives rise to important physical consequences. For example, the
construction of an action principle in Minkowski space that is invariant
under the Poincaré group transformations @xmath , where @xmath are the
Lorentz transformations, is just the same as to impose the relativity
postulates. In this way, Poincaré invariant quantum field theories
involve in their description field operators which provide certain
representations of this symmetry group [ Weinberg ( 2012 ); Sundermeyer
( 2014 ) ] . The isometry condition for infinitesimal transformations
@xmath corresponds to the Killing equation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and for Poincaré transformations in Minkowski space its solutions are
given by @xmath , where @xmath is an antisymmetric matrix. To obtain the
corresponding Killing vector fields we use the fact that Poincaré
transformations admit the unitary representation @xmath , where @xmath
and @xmath are our candidates for translations and Lorentz
transformations generators, respectively. To identify them we should
compare @xmath with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which implies that @xmath and @xmath Here @xmath are operators that do
not act on the coordinates, but their representations tell us about the
spin of the corresponding fields.

The notion of Killing vectors is generalized to the so-called conformal
Killing vectors, which are related to the coordinate changes so that
@xmath , where @xmath is the conformal factor. Such transformations
correspond, particularly, to dilatations @xmath and special conformal
transformations @xmath [ Francesco et al. ( 1997 ) ] .

Conformal symmetry, as well as conformal field theories, have made an
huge contribution on different aspects of physics, such as condensed
matter, electrodynamics, and gravity, just to mention a few examples [
Ginsparg ( 1988 ); Jackiw and Pi ( 2011 ) ] . The two-dimensional case
is special in this context. Indeed, consider the change of coordinates

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

in flat space. This transformation can be shown to be of the conformal
type if and only if @xmath and @xmath satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann
equations, i.e., they are the real and imaginary parts of a holomorphic
function. In the case of infinitesimal transformations, however, we can
be less restrictive. To see this better, it is natural to take the
complex coordinate @xmath , together with its complex conjugate @xmath ,
and consider the infinitesimal transformation @xmath , where @xmath is
assumed to be a meromorphic function which admits a Laurent expansion
around @xmath . In this situation a (primary) field @xmath
infinitesimally transforms as @xmath , from where we identify the
symmetry generators @xmath and @xmath , with @xmath . They produce a
direct sum of two copies of the infinite-dimensional Witt algebra, while
the global conformal group that maps the complex plane onto itself is
obtained from the subalgebra @xmath , which, in turn, is generated by
@xmath , [ Francesco et al. ( 1997 ) ] . Using these properties one can
introduce a conformal field theory that does not even need a specific
action principle. This corresponds to the so-called conformal bootstrap
[ Polyakov ( 1974 ) ] . This type of theories, “minimal models”, as they
are often called [ Belavin et al. ( 1984 ); Francesco et al. ( 1997 ) ]
, appears in the study of critical points in the second-order phase
transition phenomena, and their main advantage is the calculation of the
correlation functions of 2 and 3 points, only by symmetry arguments. On
the other hand, conformal theories in higher dimensions became popular
after Maldacena’s famous article [ Maldacena ( 1999 ) ] , where a
duality between a gravity theory in AdS (type @xmath string theory in
@xmath ) and a conformal field theory in the boundary ( @xmath
supersymmetric Yang-Mills) was shown. This AdS/CFT correspondence along
with holographic techniques have found applications not only in black
holes physics but also in other areas such as QCD [ Ammon and Erdmenger
( 2015 ); Brodsky et al. ( 2015 ); Deur et al. ( 2015 ) ] .

Beyond the Standard Model it has been postulated supersymmetry, based on
transformations that relate bosons and fermions [ Weinberg ( 2000 ) ] .
These models refer to an action principle defined in the “super-space”,
which is a place where bosonic and fermion quantities (described by
Grassmann’s variables) live together. To overcome the Coleman-Mandula
theorem: “space-time and internal symmetries cannot be combined in any
but a trivial way”, see [ Pelc and Horwitz ( 1997 ) ] , the concept of
symmetry is generalized to a @xmath -graded algebra, or superalgebra,
which is characterized by the supercommutator @xmath ,

-   @xmath if @xmath and @xmath are bosonic generators,

-   @xmath if one generator is bonosic while another is fermionic,

-   @xmath if both generators are fermionic.

To discriminate between bosonic and fermionic objects it is necessary to
introduce a grading operator @xmath , @xmath , that commutes with all
bosonic generators and anti-commutes with fermionic ones. The conserved
quantities that generate the supersymmetric transformations are called
supercharges and are the fermionic operators. For the study of
supersymmetry outside the framework of quantum field theory, the
concepts of pseudo-classical mechanics [ Berezin and Marinov ( 1975 ,
1976 ); Casalbuoni ( 1976 ) ] and its quantum version, supersymmetric
quantum mechanics [ Witten ( 1981 , 1982 ); Cooper et al. ( 1995 ) ] ,
were introduced. The latter has become an invaluable tool in the study
of solvable potentials, and is closely related to the theory of
integrable classical field systems and their solitonic and finite-gap
type solutions [ Matveev and Salle ( 1991 ) ] . Details of this
formalism are presented in the next chapter.

At this point it is clear that symmetries govern physics, and in this
context, the notion of hidden symmetries becomes relevant [ Cariglia (
2014 ) ] . To explain it, let us consider again classical mechanics. If,
regardless of the initial conditions, it happens that the nature of the
trajectories in some system is “special ” (in a geometric sense), this
should indicate on the presence of the hidden symmetries. Form the
perspective of symmetry transformations, these objects mix the
coordinate and velocity (momenta) variables in Lagrangian (Hamiltonian)
formalism. At the quantum level, hidden symmetries can explain peculiar
properties of the physical spectrum, such as a degeneration. Take, for
example, the case of the Kepler-Coulomb problem, where we know that the
system is invariant under rotations and that the particle trajectories,
being conical sections, lie in the plane orthogonal to the angular
momentum vector. We also know that the geometric properties are
determined by the energy and the angular momentum itself, but there is
one more special property, the orientation of the trajectory, which is
given by the so-called Laplace-Runge-Lentz vector to be the second-order
in canonical momenta quantity. This vector integral is also relevant at
a quantum level because it explains the “accidental” degeneration in the
spectrum of the hydrogen atom model [ Pauli ( 1926 ) ] . From now on,
the nonlinear in canonical momenta integrals of motion different from
Hamiltonian, like the mentioned Laplace-Runge-Lentz vector, will be
called hidden symmetries. To study the geometric interpretation of these
objects, which are usually related to Killing tensors and conformal
Killing tensors [ Cariglia ( 2014 ) ] , a good approach corresponds to
the Eisenhart-Duval lift [ Cariglia et al. ( 2018 ) ] , the procedure by
which classical trajectories are identified with the null geodesics of a
non-trivial geometry with two extra dimensions. Some other well known
examples where these objects play a key role are the three-dimensional
isotropic harmonic oscillator [ Jauch and Hill ( 1940 ); Fradkin ( 1965
) ] , the anisotropic harmonic oscillator [ Bonatsos et al. ( 1994 );
de Boer et al. ( 1996 ) ] , the Higgs oscillator [ Zhedanov ( 1992 );
Evnin and Rongvoram ( 2017 ) ] , nonlinear supersymmetry [ Plyushchay (
2019 ) ] and a charged particle in a monopole background [ Plyushchay
and Wipf ( 2014 ); Inzunza et al. ( 2020b ) ] .

The hidden symmetries satisfy nonlinear algebras in the general case.
The first examples of nonlinear algebras introduced in field theory
literature were the infinite @xmath algebras [ Zamolodchikov ( 1985 ) ]
, which are necessary to study the nature of the infinite-dimensional
groups that appear in two-dimensional conformal models. The listed above
systems are examples of elementary models whose associated integrals of
motions satisfy finite @xmath algebras, which in turns, have played a
relevant role in understanding of their infinite counterpart [ de Boer
et al. ( 1996 ) ] .

In the particular case of one-dimensional quantum mechanics, the
supersymmetric algorithm allows us to build families of solvable
potentials that have spectral peculiarities, perfectly encoded in hidden
symmetries. A good example of this are the rational deformations of the
harmonic oscillator, characterized by a potential of the form @xmath ,
where @xmath is a regular polynomial on the real line [ Krein ( 1957 );
Adler ( 1994 ) ] . Systems of this nature find importance in the field
of exceptional orthogonal polynomials, see for example [ Dubov et al. (
1994 ); Quesne ( 2012 ); Gómez-Ullate et al. ( 2013 ) ] . The
corresponding spectrum of this kind of systems is divided into @xmath
subsets of equidistant energy levels, isolated from each other. The
first @xmath subsets, or bands, have a finite number of levels, while
the last band has infinite number of equidistant discrete levels. In [
Cariñena and Plyushchay ( 2017 ) ] , the spectrum-generating ladder
operators for these systems were built, and they turned out to be higher
order symmetry operators.

This Thesis reviews in a self-contained manner the results obtained
within the framework of a three-years research project, in which we
address the following problems:

a) Connection between different mechanical systems through symmetries
The @xmath conformal algebra

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

describes different quantum systems with continuous spectrum, that is,
@xmath could represent the Hamiltonian of a free particle, Calogero
models, monopole-charge system, etc. This algebra is isomorphic to the
@xmath algebra,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is a compact generator that represents the Hamiltonian of a
confined system, such as the harmonic oscillator. We address the problem
of establishing a mapping between these two forms of dynamics associated
with conformal algebra. Such a transformation would be useful,
particuarly, for mapping conserved quantities that are easier to
identify for one system than for the other.

b) Hidden and bosonized supersymmetry
In quantum mechanics, the reflection operator @xmath is defined by
@xmath and @xmath . If we choose the supersymmetric grading operator
@xmath to be @xmath , we can construct bosonized supersymmetric systems
[ Plyushchay ( 1996 ) ; @xmath Plyushchay ( 2000a ) ; @xmath Gamboa
et al. ( 1999 ) ; @xmath Correa et al. ( 2007 ) ; Correa and Plyushchay
( 2007 ); Correa et al. ( 2008 ); Jakubskỳ et al. ( 2010 ) ] which do
not employ fermionic degrees of freedom. We focus on the origin of the
hidden bosonized superconformal symmetry of the harmonic oscillator in
one dimension [ de Crombrugghe and Rittenberg ( 1983 ); Balantekin
et al. ( 1988 ); Cariñena and Plyushchay ( 2016a ); Bonezzi et al. (
2017 ) ] , that is, we build an unconventional supersymmetric system
that, after nonlocal transformation of the Foldy-Wouthuysen type and a
dimensional reduction [ Jakubskỳ et al. ( 2010 ) ] , produces the
superalgebra we are looking for.

c) Hidden symmetries in rationally extended conformal mechanics
The simplest conformal invariant system that one can construct is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is a dimensionless constant that should be non-negative in
classical mechanics and @xmath at the quantum level. This model does not
have a well-defined invariant ground state and to eliminate this
deficiency, de Alfaro, Fubini, and Furlan used a particular coordinate
and time change to transform the latter action into

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The corresponding Hamiltonian is compact and has a well-defined ground
state at the quantum level, see [ de Alfaro et al. ( 1976 ) ] . This
system, called the de Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan model (AFF), and its
supersymmetric extensions [ Akulov and Pashnev ( 1983 ); Fubini and
Rabinovici ( 1984 ); Ivanov et al. ( 1989 ); Donets et al. ( 2000 );
Fedoruk et al. ( 2012 ) ] have attracted a great attention over the
years in a variety of fields such as particles dynamics in black hole
backgrounds [ Gibbons and Townsend ( 1999 ) ; @xmath Michelson and
Strominger ( 1999 ) ; @xmath de Azcarraga et al. ( 1999 ) ; @xmath
Britto-Pacumio et al. ( 2000 ) ; @xmath Galajinsky ( 2015 ) ] , @xmath
cosmology @xmath [ Duval et al. ( 1991 ) ; @xmath Pioline and Waldron (
2003 ) ] , @xmath nonrelativistic @xmath AdS/CFT @xmath correspondence
@xmath [ Son ( 2008 ) ; @xmath Balasubramanian and McGreevy ( 2008 );
Barbon and Fuertes ( 2008 ); Chamon et al. ( 2011 ) ] , QCD confinement
problem [ Brodsky et al. ( 2015 ); Deur et al. ( 2015 ) ] , physics of
Bose-Einstein condensates [ Prain et al. ( 2010 ); Ohashi et al. ( 2017
) ] and anyon statistics [ Leinaas and Myrheim ( 1977 , 1988 );
Mackenzie and Wilczek ( 1988 ) ] . We apply the generalized
Darboux-Crum-Krein-Adler transformation (DCKA) [ Moutard ( 1878 , 1875
); Darboux ( 1882 ); Crum ( 1955 ); Krein ( 1957 ); Adler ( 1994 );
Matveev and Salle ( 1991 ) ] to the AFF model to construct rational
deformations of this system. The objective is to follow the approach
given in [ Cariñena and Plyushchay ( 2017 ) ] to find the ladder
operators that generate spectrum of these systems.

d) Hidden symmetries in three-dimensional conformal mechanics
Consider a charged particle moving in a magnetic field generated by a
Dirac monopole, i.e., in a monopole background [ Sakurai ( 1994 ) ] ,
which is also subject to a central potential of the form @xmath . In [
Plyushchay and Wipf ( 2014 ) ] it had already been shown that the system
has hidden symmetries when @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath are the
particle’s electric charge and the monopole magnetic charge,
respectively. It was also shown that the system allows an @xmath
supersymmetric extension. We investigate the possibility of obtaining
hidden integrals of motion when the central potential is changed for
@xmath , and we look for possible supersymmetric extensions. The results
obtained from problem a) are used to investigate this problem.

The results of investigation of the listed problems were reported in the
articles [ Cariñena et al. ( 2018 ); Inzunza and Plyushchay ( 2018 ,
2019a , 2019b ); Inzunza et al. ( 2020a , b ) ] .

The subsequent main part of the Thesis is organized as follows. In Chap.
1 we review the supersymmetric quantum mechanics formalism as well as
the generalized Darboux transformations and their confluent extensions.
In Chap. 2 we revisit the one-dimensional conformal mechanics model of
de Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan [ de Alfaro et al. ( 1976 ) ] , as well as
its @xmath supersymmetric extension, leading us to the @xmath
superconformal symmetry. In Chap. 3 , based on [ Inzunza et al. ( 2020a
) ] , we consider the conformal bridge transformation and its
applications to models in one and two dimensions. In Chap. 4 , we
explain the origin of the hidden bosonic superconformal symmetry of the
harmonic oscillator [ Inzunza and Plyushchay ( 2018 ) ] . In Chap. 5 we
review the results of ref. [ Cariñena et al. ( 2018 ) ] , where rational
extensions of the conformal mechanics model characterized by the
potential @xmath with @xmath , as well as its spectrum-generating ladder
operators are constructed. In Chap. 6 , following [ Inzunza and
Plyushchay ( 2019a ) ] , we consider supersymmetric extensions of the
rationally deformed system of Chap. 5 , as well as its complete
spectrum-generating nonlinear superalgebra. In Chap. 7 we exploit a
discrete Klein four-group symmetry of the Schrödinger equation for the
AFF model to generalize the construction of rationally extended systems
and the spectrum-generating ladder operator sets for the case in which
integer parameter @xmath is replaced by a real number @xmath [ Inzunza
and Plyushchay ( 2019b ) ] . In this case, the confluent Darboux
transformations appear naturally. Chap. 8 and 9 are devoted to
investigation, in the light of hidden symmetries, of the conformal
mechanics in a monopole background as well as its supersymmetric
extension, which is characterized by a three-dimensional realization of
the @xmath superconformal symmetry [ Inzunza et al. ( 2020b ) ] . The
Thesis ends with its Conclusion and Outlook. In Appendix, some technical
details are collected.

## Chapter 1 Supersymmetric quantum mechanics

The application of supersymmetric ideas in nonrelativistic quantum
mechanics has given us a better understanding of the problem of solvable
potentials and its associated hidden symmetries. In this context, the
main technique is the factorization method [ Infeld and Hull ( 1951 );
Cooper et al. ( 1995 ) ] , which relates a particular quantum mechanical
system with another one (the so-called superpartner). In the
one-dimensional case, the formalism of construction of such operators
(starting from a well known quantum system) receives the name of
Darboux-Crum-Krein-Adler transformation [ Moutard ( 1878 , 1875 );
Darboux ( 1882 ); Crum ( 1955 ); Krein ( 1957 ); Adler ( 1994 ); Matveev
and Salle ( 1991 ) ] . An algorithmic procedure involves a given number
of eigenstates of the original system, typically called “seed states”,
and in its confluent extension Jordan states are also considered [
Schulze-Halberg ( 2013 ); Correa et al. ( 2015 ); Contreras-Astorga and
Schulze-Halberg ( 2015 ) ] . In this chapter we revisit these methods.

Generalization @xmath to @xmath higher @xmath spatial @xmath dimensions
@xmath can @xmath be @xmath reformulated @xmath in @xmath different
@xmath ways, @xmath see @xmath [ Kirchberg et al. ( 2003 ); Ivanov
et al. ( 2003 ); Kirchberg et al. ( 2005 ); Bellucci et al. ( 2005 ,
2006 ); Kozyrev et al. ( 2017 ) ] . In this Thesis, we just consider the
approach of a given Dirac Hamiltonian, whose square produces a
supersymmetric Hamiltonian operator [ Cooper et al. ( 1995 ) ] .

### 1.1 The one-dimensional case

In one-dimensional systems, the factorization method consists in
introducing intertwining operators of the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which satisfy

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Here @xmath is called superpotential and @xmath are the superpartner
systems. Now, let us assume we know a function @xmath such that @xmath .
This defines a nonlinear Riccati type equation for @xmath

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and a particular solution of which is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which in turns implies @xmath . This result allows us to conclude the
following: For a given well known physical system we can select one of
the two linear independent (formal) zero energy solutions to recognize
the associated superpotential and use it to construct a new quantum
mechanical system given by @xmath . From the first equation in ( 1.1.4 )
it can be concluded that @xmath must not have zeros in the domain of
@xmath to obtain a priori , a regular superpotential and a posteriori ,
a well defined superpartner in the same domain. If the selected state
does not fulfill this condition we call the resulting system as a
‘‘virtual system’’ that makes no physical sense ¹ ¹ 1 Such virtual
systems are useful in the context of higher order supersymmetry, see for
example [ Arancibia et al. ( 2013 ); Plyushchay ( 2017 ); Cariñena
et al. ( 2018 ) ] . . One typically refers to @xmath as a seed state.

On the other hand, the action of operator @xmath on other eigenfunctions
of @xmath produces eigenstates of @xmath . To show this statement we use
Eq. ( 1.1.2 ) to deduce the intertwining relations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Then, if @xmath is an eigenstate of @xmath with eigenvalue @xmath we get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Of course these relations also work for the second linearly independent
solution of the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.1.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which together with @xmath satisfies @xmath , where @xmath is the
Wronskian of two functions.

It is not difficult to show that operator @xmath annihilates the state
@xmath which is one of the zero eigenvalue solutions of @xmath ² ² 2
Note that with this method we only obtain one of the two linear
independent solutions since @xmath . To obtain the second linear
independent solution we should extend the transformation by applying it
to Jordan states. . Knowing this, one can say something about the
spectrum of the latter Hamiltonian in correspondence with the behavior
of the seed state. First, acting on physical states of @xmath , operator
@xmath produces physical states of @xmath and second, if @xmath is a
physical state, then the spectrum of @xmath does not have this energy
level. On the other hand, if the seed state is nonphysical, two things
could happen: 1) @xmath is normalizable and system @xmath possesses an
extra level and 2) @xmath is nonphysical and both systems are
isospectral.

Finally, suppose we have a given number of differential operators
denoted by @xmath , each of them of a certain differential order @xmath
, which together with @xmath span a symmetry algebra. In this context,
it is not difficult to show the relation @xmath , which means that when
operator @xmath is the integral of motion of @xmath , then @xmath (of
differential order @xmath ) is the integral for @xmath and the system is
described (in the general case) by a certain nonlinear deformed algebra.
In conclusion, the method not only serves to map states but also to
obtain hidden integrals of motion of the generated system. This
procedure is known as “Darboux-dressing”.

We have the complete picture to extend our superpartner systems to
supersymmetric quantum mechanics. We use our Hamiltonians and
intertwiners to construct the @xmath matrix operators

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.1.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which satisfy the @xmath ³ ³ 3 Here @xmath indicates the number of true
fermionic integrals. Poincaré superalgebra

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.1.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath grading operator @xmath . In the case in which the state
@xmath (or @xmath ) is the physical ground state of @xmath ( @xmath ),
then the spinor @xmath (or @xmath ) is the supersymmetric invariant
ground state of @xmath . Otherwise supersymmetry is spontaneously
broken.

The method described in this paragraph is called the Darboux
transformation and is the first step in an iterative process. In the
next step we can produce a third new Hamiltonian by taking a seed state
from @xmath and so on. The final form of the method after a several
number of steps is called the “Darboux-Crum-Krein-Adler transformation”
(DCKA transformation for short) whose details are explored in the
following section.

### 1.2 DCKA transformation

Let us start with the equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

corresponding to the eigenvalue problem of a Schrödinger type operator
@xmath . In this paragraph we treat Eq. ( 1.2.1 ) as a formal second
order differential equation on some interval @xmath . Consider now a set
of solutions @xmath corresponding to eigenvalues @xmath , @xmath . We
use them as seed states for our DCKA transformation and generate the new
Schrödinger operator

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

If the set of the seed states is chosen in such a way that the
generalized Wronskian of @xmath functions

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

takes nonzero values on @xmath , then the potential of the generated
system will also be nonsingular there. In general case, solutions of (
1.2.2 ) are obtained from solutions of Eq. ( 1.2.1 ) as follows

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the differential operator of order @xmath defined
recursively as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Note that this operator is the natural generalization of ( 1.1.4 ) with
@xmath and by the construction, @xmath . Operator @xmath and its
Hermitian conjugate @xmath intertwine the operators @xmath and @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and satisfy relations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

From the first equation in ( 1.2.7 ) one can find that @xmath .
Similarly to ( 1.2.4 ), @xmath for @xmath , and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Following the same approach as in the previous section, we can also use
the pair @xmath and @xmath and their corresponding intertwining
operators to construct an @xmath superextended system described by the
@xmath matrix Hamiltonian and the supercharges given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a constant associated with the energy levels of the seed
states. These generators produce the (anti)commutation relations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.2.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which for @xmath correspond to an @xmath Poincaré supersymmetry and for
@xmath , we have a nonlinear deformation of the latter supersymmetry
(here @xmath represents a polynomial of order @xmath in @xmath ).
Examples of this kind of systems will be the main focus in Chap. 6 .

The iterative nature of DCKA transformation allows us to derive some
useful Wronskian identities for a given set of eigenstates. They are
shown in Appendix A .

### 1.3 Jordan states and confluent Darboux transformation

Jordan states correspond to functions that are annihilated by a certain
polynomial of the Schrödinger operator @xmath [ Correa et al. ( 2015 ) ]
. They were used, for example, in the construction of isospectral @xmath
deformations @xmath of @xmath the @xmath harmonic @xmath oscillator
@xmath [ Cariñena and Plyushchay ( 2016b , 2017 ) ; Inzunza and
Plyushchay ( 2018 ) ] , and also they can be used to construct solutions
of the KdV equation [ Correa and Fring ( 2016 ); Mateos Guilarte and
Plyushchay ( 2017 ) ] . These Jordan states will play a key role
throughout this manuscript. This time we will focus our attention on
building solutions of the fourth order differential equation @xmath .

Let us take an eigenstate @xmath with eigenvalue @xmath as a seed state
of the Darboux transformation. The corresponding intertwining operators
are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

According to Eq. ( 1.2.7 ), their product gives us the shifted
Schrödinger operator @xmath , whose kernel is spanned by the linear
independent states @xmath and @xmath . The problem of constructing
Jordan states reduces then to solving equations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Their solutions are given, up to a linear combination of @xmath and
@xmath , by particular solutions of respective inhomogeneous equations,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Here the integration limits are chosen coherently with the region where
the operator @xmath is defined, and we have the relations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.3.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which will be useful to produce nonsingular confluent Darboux
transformations.

Let us inspect now the role of Jordan states ( 1.3.3 ) in DCKA
transformation generated by a set of the seed states @xmath . The
intertwining operator ( 1.2.5 ) and Eqs. ( 1.2.6 ) and ( 1.3.2 ) give us
the relations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.3.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

If the state @xmath (or @xmath ) is annihilated by @xmath , i.e., if the
set of the seed states @xmath includes @xmath (or @xmath ), the function
@xmath (or @xmath ) will be an eigenstate of @xmath with eigenvalue
@xmath which is available to produce another Darboux transformation if
we consider @xmath as an intermediate system. Otherwise, the indicated
function is a Jordan state of @xmath , and in correspondence with (
1.3.3 ) we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.3.6)
                 (1.3.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

up to a linear combination with @xmath and @xmath .

Having in mind that Jordan states appear naturally in the confluent
generalized Darboux transformations [ Correa et al. ( 2015 ) ] , one can
consider directly a generalized Darboux transformation based on the
following set of the seed states : @xmath . This generates a
Darboux-transformed system which we denote by @xmath . The intertwining
operator @xmath as a differential operator of order @xmath is built
according to the same rule ( 1.2.5 ), but with the inclusion of Jordan
states into the set of generating functions. By the construction, this
operator annihilates the chosen @xmath seed states, and one can show
that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.3.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This, in particular, means that @xmath .

### 1.4 A three-dimensional example

Unlike the one-dimensional case, three-dimensional supersymmetric
quantum mechanics does not have a unique generalization. Here, following
[ Cooper et al. ( 1995 ) ] , we begin with a charged massless Dirac
particle in a four-dimensional Euclidian space. Assuming the presence of
an external electromagnetic field, the Dirac’s equation takes the form (
@xmath )

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.4.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the associated @xmath gauge potential, the metric is
just @xmath and @xmath are the Euclidean gamma matrices

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.4.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Assuming that the gauge field does not depend on @xmath , we can look
for stationary solutions of the form @xmath . Expanding equation ( 1.4.1
) in terms of this ansatz we get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.4.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

By applying @xmath from the left, the Schrödinger equation @xmath is
obtained, where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.4.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is a Pauli Hamiltonian operator with @xmath and @xmath . The operator
@xmath , together with @xmath and @xmath produce a three-dimensional
realization of the @xmath Poincaré supersymmetry with grading operator
@xmath . Furthermore, in the dual case @xmath (antidual case @xmath )
the system possesses the nontrivial bosonic integral of motion @xmath (
@xmath ), and the commutation relations @xmath ( @xmath ) with @xmath ,
produce other 3 pairs of supercharges.

The system described by ( 1.4.4 ) has been studied properly in [
Kirchberg et al. ( 2005 ) ] where authors show that dual and anti-dual
cases are the only ones that admit extensions of the Poincaré
supersymmetry. In [ Plyushchay and Wipf ( 2014 ) ] , the case of dual
and anti-dual dyon (where the magnetic fields is due to a Dirac magnetic
monopole) was considered, and it was shown that the system possesses the
exceptional @xmath superconformal algebra @xmath [ Ivanov et al. ( 2003
) ] .

### 1.5 Remarks

The tools considered in this chapter are going to be our principal
methods for the rest of this Thesis. When we study one-dimensional
potentials, our initial system for the DCKA transformation will always
be a Newton-Hooke conformal invariant particle [ Niederer ( 1973 );
Galajinsky ( 2010 ); Andrzejewski ( 2014 ); Galajinsky ( 2018 ) ] , the
properties of which are described in Chaps. 2 and 3 . Our principal
target is to study the hidden symmetries of the nontrivial resulting
systems and their supersymmetric extensions. This is the main content of
Chaps. 4 - 7 .

In Chap. 8 and 9 we study a three-dimensional generalization of the
system introduced in Chap. 2 , as well as its supersymmetric extensions.
The resulting system will have superconformal symmetry that can be
reinterpret in accordance with Sec. 1.4 , but with a nontrivial gauge
potential.

## Chapter 2 One-dimensional conformal mechanics

As it was noted in the introduction, conformal invariance appears as a
natural extension of the Poincaré symmetry of space-time, and involves
the set of transformations that perform the change @xmath , where @xmath
is the metric tensor and @xmath the conformal factor [ Francesco et al.
( 1997 ); Sundermeyer ( 2014 ) ] . The transformations that make this
job (preservation of angles) are the space-time dilatations and the
special conformal transformations. Some examples of space-time manifolds
that allow this extension are the flat space (Minkowski), together with
de Sitter (dS) and Anti de Sitter (AdS) spaces [ Francesco et al. ( 1997
); Nakahara ( 2003 ) ] .

The @xmath conformal algebra is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.0.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

being @xmath , @xmath and @xmath the generators of time translations,
dilatations and special conformal transformations, for details we
recommend [ Fedoruk et al. ( 2012 ) ] . Taking the linear combinations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.0.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a constant that compensates the dimensions of @xmath and
@xmath , we obtain the Lorentz algebra in @xmath -dimensional Minkowski
space, with metric @xmath , given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.0.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which, in turn, is isomorphic to the @xmath algebra, [ Plyushchay ( 1993
) ] ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.0.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This algebra has the automorphisms @xmath @xmath and @xmath and the
Casimir element is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.0.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

One of the objectives of this Thesis is to study models that have both
this symmetry and some supersymmetric extensions of it. We also study
possible nonlinear extensions of (super)conformal algebra, performed in
terms of hidden symmetries.

This chapter is devoted to the analysis of classical and quantum
conformal mechanical models. In Sec. 2.1 we review the theory behind the
de Alfaro, Fubini, and Furlan (AFF) model, presented in [ de Alfaro
et al. ( 1976 ) ] , that looks for a well-defined one-dimensional
quantum system with a conformal invariant ground state. In Sec. 2.2 we
use the tools developed in Chap. 1 to construct the @xmath
supersymmetric extension of the AFF model.

### 2.1 The de Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan model

Consider the one-dimensional system given by the action, [ de Alfaro
et al. ( 1976 ) ] ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath takes values on the positive real line and has dimension
@xmath , besides @xmath is a dimensionless coupling constant which
classically is assumed to be positive to avoid the “problem of fall to
the center”. This action could represent, for example, a Calogero model
of two particles, but omitting the degree of freedom of the center of
mass [ Calogero ( 1969 , 1972 ) ] .

On can show that the action ( 2.1.1 ) is invariant under time
translations @xmath , space-time dilatations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and the spacial conformal transformations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are parameters of the corresponding
transformations. This symmetry is generated by the Hamiltonian @xmath ,
the dilatations generator @xmath , and generator of special conformal
transformations @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath . These are the integrals of motion that satisfy the
equation of the form @xmath where @xmath denotes Poisson brackets. We
often call objects of this type as “dynamical integrals”, and in this
case they obey the classical version of @xmath algebra

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and the Casimir invariant ( 2.0.5 ) takes the value @xmath . The last
relation in ( 2.1.4 ) gives us the solution of the corresponding
Euler-Lagrange equation derived from ( 2.1.1 ),

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where real-valued constants @xmath , @xmath and @xmath correspond to the
values of the integrals @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , respectively (for a
given initial configuration).

Note that in the case of @xmath , @xmath takes the form of an object
that looks like the Hamiltonian of a free particles, but is defined in
the restricted domain @xmath . The notable difference between this
system and the free particle @xmath , which lives in @xmath , is that
the latter has two additional integrals of motion, namely the momentum
@xmath and the Galileo boost generator @xmath , with @xmath . They
produce Heisenberg algebra and together with the generators @xmath and
@xmath , leading to the Schrödinger symmetry [ Niederer ( 1972 ); Duval
and Horvathy ( 1994 ); Henkel and Unterberger ( 2003 ); Son ( 2008 );
Aizawa ( 2011 ) ] ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.1.7)
     @xmath      (2.1.8)
     @xmath      (2.1.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The model ( 2.1.1 ) has a problem at the quantum level, as we explain
below: In the Schrödinger picture, the quantum version of the generators
( 2.1.4 ) are given by ( @xmath )

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where we have parameterized @xmath as @xmath . Obviously, the operators
@xmath and @xmath are not integrals of motion, however they can be
promoted to dynamical integrals, in the sense of the Heisenberg equation
@xmath , by means of the unitary transformation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

This is the general recipe for moving from the Schrödinger picture to
the Heisenberg picture, and in this last framework the operators @xmath
and @xmath are changed for @xmath and @xmath , respectively.

The Hamiltonian @xmath is self-adjoint for the cases in which @xmath and
admits self-adjoint extensions for @xmath , [ Landau and Lifshitz ( 1965
); Kirsten and Loya ( 2010 ) ] . In these cases, @xmath has a continuous
spectrum @xmath , with @xmath , in the domain @xmath and the physical
eigenstates are given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the Bessel function of the first kind

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

From here it is not difficult to show that the state @xmath corresponds
to the energy @xmath , which implies that the only scale-invariant
solutions are those with zero energy eigenvalue, which in this case are
given by the nonphysical solutions @xmath and @xmath , the first of
which is not bounded at infinity and the second diverges when @xmath .
This means that conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken at the
quantum level.

To @xmath find @xmath a @xmath conformal @xmath invariant @xmath model
@xmath with @xmath a @xmath well-defined @xmath ground @xmath state,
@xmath the @xmath proposal @xmath in @xmath [ de Alfaro et al. ( 1976 )
] is to consider the following change of the variables at the classical
level

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are real constants with dimensions
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath , and @xmath . This is in fact related to a
change of coordinates in an AdS @xmath space, where @xmath is not a good
global coordinate, in contrast to @xmath [ Michelson and Strominger (
1999 ) ] . Under the transformation ( 2.1.14 ), action ( 2.1.1 ) takes
the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath @xmath , and @xmath . Action @xmath is the so-called de
Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan (AFF) model, from where we obtain the new time
translation generator

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The evolution parameter @xmath varies in the finite interval @xmath ,
and new Hamiltonian ( 2.1.16 ) is conjugate to this good global time
coordinate. As @xmath is a dimensionful parameter, @xmath , ( 2.1.16 )
breaks the manifest scale invariance of the original system ( 2.1.1 ),
and via such a basic mechanism the mass and length scales are introduced
in holographic QCD (often referred to as “AdS/QCD”) [ Brodsky et al. (
2015 ); Deur et al. ( 2015 ) ] .

In spite of the introduced scale, the action of the new system is
conformal invariant as we will see now. The dilatation generator @xmath
and the conformal transformation generator @xmath associated with the
action @xmath are given by the explicitly depending on time @xmath
integrals

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.17)
     @xmath      (2.1.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which generate the Newton-Hooke symmetry, [ Niederer ( 1973 );
Galajinsky ( 2010 ); Andrzejewski ( 2014 ); Galajinsky ( 2018 ) ] ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

whose Casimir invariant is @xmath . Using Eqs. ( 2.1.17 ) and ( 2.1.18
), one can find solution to the equation of motion of the system (
2.1.15 ),

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are constants corresponding to the
values of the integrals @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , respectively, and
obeying the relation @xmath . From the explicit form of the solution we
see that it is periodic with the period @xmath not depending on the
value of the coupling constant ¹ ¹ 1 System given by Hamiltonian (
2.1.16 ) is an isoperiodic deformation of the half-harmonic oscillator
of frequency @xmath [ Asorey et al. ( 2007 ) ] . @xmath . The finite
interval in which the evolution parameter @xmath varies corresponds to
the period of the motion of the system ( 2.1.15 ), and one can consider
@xmath as the compact evolution parameter that takes values on the
closed interval @xmath with identified ends.

As in the previous case, if one sets @xmath , @xmath is formally reduced
to the Hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator, however the object is
defined in @xmath (we will call it as half harmonic oscillator). If we
extend for this case the domain to the entire real line, i.e., we
exchange @xmath , the resulting system @xmath has the additional
dynamical integrals

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

They are identified as the initial conditions of the oscillatory motion
and in terms of them, the Hamiltonian is read as @xmath . The generators
( 2.1.21 ), together with generators @xmath , @xmath and @xmath produce
the following Poisson brackets relations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.22)
     @xmath      (2.1.23)
     @xmath      (2.1.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Note that if instead to take @xmath we consider @xmath one gets the
algebraic relations ( 2.1.7 ), ( 2.1.8 ) and ( 2.1.9 ), which mean that
generators @xmath are just another basis for the Schrödinger symmetry.
In fact by taking the limit @xmath we recover the free particle
generators.

According to [ Dirac ( 1949 ) ] , starting from a given symmetry
algebra, one can freely designate a particular generator or a linear
combination of generators as Hamiltonian, leading to different forms of
dynamics. This terminology was introduced in the context of special
relativity, however, the two models discussed above are good examples in
nonrelativistic mechanics.

At the quantum level, the AFF Hamiltonian takes the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which as well as @xmath in ( 2.1.10 ), has a bounded spectrum restricted
from below in the domain @xmath for @xmath [ Falomir et al. ( 2002 );
Falomir and Pisani ( 2005 ) ] . The normalized eigenstates of the system
and its respective energy values are given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

are the generalized Laguerre Polynomials. Note that @xmath in ( 2.1.25 )
vanishes for @xmath and for @xmath (where we have some problems with
boundary conditions) and for both cases @xmath looks like an harmonic
oscillator Hamiltonian. Indeed, the well known relations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.28)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where functions @xmath are the Hermite polynomials, show us that in the
first case eigenfunctions ( 2.1.26 ) become the odd eigenstates of the
harmonic oscillator (vanishing at the origin), and in the second case,
they take the form of the even eigenstates of the latter mentioned
system (which do not vanish at @xmath , thereby violating the imposed
boundary conditions).

Instead to do a direct quantization of generators @xmath and @xmath , it
is worth it to consider complex combinations of them. In particular, in
the Schrödinger picture we construct

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which, together with @xmath , produce the commutator relations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.30)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and by using the identification @xmath and @xmath , we recognize the
@xmath algebra ( 2.0.4 ). On the Hilbert space of the AFF system, the
states ( 2.1.26 ) correspond to an infinite-dimensional unitary
irreducible representation of the @xmath algebra of the discrete type
series @xmath with @xmath , and the Casimir operator takes the value
@xmath , [ Plyushchay ( 1993 ) ] .

As operators @xmath are not integrals of motion, when we go to the
Heisenberg picture, it is necessary to replace operators @xmath by the
dynamical integrals @xmath .

Relations ( 2.1.30 ) clearly show us that @xmath are ladder operators
which change the energy in @xmath . Their action can be computed by
means of the corresponding recurrence relations of Laguerre polynomials,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (2.1.31)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Using this we get

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.1.32)
     @xmath      (2.1.33)
  -- -------- -- ----------

from where we see that the lowering operator @xmath annihilates the
ground state of the system. In next section we will show that these
operators have their own origin in supersymmetric quantum mechanics.

### 2.2 The @xmath superconformal symmetry

The aim of this section is to construct an @xmath super-extension of the
AFF model ( 2.1.25 ). To this end, we apply the method introduced in
Chap. 1 .

For the construction let us use the ground state @xmath as a seed state
for the first order Darboux transformation. The associated intertwining
operators are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which produce

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and intertwining relations take the form ( 1.1.5 ). Using the recurrence
relations that Laguerre polynomials satisfy ( 2.1.31 ), one gets the
explicit action of @xmath on eigenstates ( 2.1.26 ),

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

With the help of ( 2.2.1 ) we can construct the matrix generators

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.4)
     @xmath      (2.2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the @xmath grading operator. These generators produce
the Poincaré supersymmetry ( 1.1.9 ). Operator @xmath has the spectrum
@xmath , @xmath and the unique ground state @xmath is annihilated by all
generators in ( 2.2.4 ), therefore supersymmetry is in the exact phase.

On the other hand, the system ( 2.1.25 ) possesses the nonphysical
solutions @xmath of the eigenvalues @xmath ² ² 2 The stationary
Schrödinger equation @xmath has a discrete symmetry group, and the
transformation defined as @xmath and @xmath is an element of this group,
see Chap. 7 . The nonphysical eigenstates produced by the action of the
mentioned group can be used in the Darboux transformations, resulting in
new solvable systems. . Then, instead of the ground state we could
select the function @xmath as a seed state. The resulting intertwining
operators are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Their products give us

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and in terms of @xmath the intertwining relations take the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Coherently with this, the action of operators @xmath on the eigenstates
is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.2.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Just like we did with @xmath , we can also use @xmath to build other
matrix operators

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.10)
     @xmath      (2.2.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which again will satisfy the @xmath Poincaré supersymmetry, but now, in
the spontaneously broken phase ³ ³ 3 The seed state @xmath is
nonphysical and @xmath does not satisfy the boundary condition at the
origin. ; the spectrum of @xmath is @xmath , @xmath and there is no
physical eigenstate which is simultaneously annihilated by both odd
operators @xmath . On the other hand one can reinterpret the object
@xmath as a linear combination of @xmath and the nontrivial integral

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

that plays the role of what will become an @xmath symmetry generator.

Now, remember that the system ( 2.1.25 ) has the two second order ladder
operators ( 2.1.29 ). Namely, they are constructed from @xmath and
@xmath as follows

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.13)
     @xmath      (2.2.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

By using this structure together with the Eqs. ( 2.2.9 ) and ( 2.2.3 )
it is easy to check the relations ( 2.1.32 ). Also, by means of the Eqs.
( 2.2.2 ) and ( 2.2.7 ), in addition with the intertwining relations
corresponding to @xmath and @xmath , it is easy to derive the @xmath
algebra ( 2.1.30 ).

Returning to the matrix operators subject, the relations ( 2.2.13 )-(
2.2.14 ) show us that the anti-commutator between generators @xmath and
@xmath produces the even operators

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which are the corresponding super-extensions of the ladder operators of
systems @xmath and @xmath . Then, all together the generators @xmath
satisfy the superalgebraic relations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.16)
     @xmath      (2.2.17)
     @xmath      (2.2.18)
     @xmath      (2.2.19)
     @xmath      (2.2.20)
     @xmath      (2.2.21)
     @xmath      (2.2.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

From here we realize that operators @xmath and @xmath are not integrals
of motion, and in the Heisenberg picture we have instead the dynamical
integrals @xmath and @xmath .

Superalgebra @xmath ( 2.2.16 )-( 2.2.22 ) @xmath @xmath is @xmath
identified @xmath with @xmath the @xmath @xmath @xmath superconformal
@xmath symmetry @xmath @xmath [ Inzunza and Plyushchay ( 2018 , 2019a ,
2019b ) ] , and has the automorphism @xmath given by the transformations
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath @xmath .
Transformation @xmath shows us what would happen with the superalgebra
if we had chosen @xmath instead of @xmath as our time translation
generator.

For future applications, we present the superalgebraic structure in
terms of nilpotent fermionic operators

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and its Hermitian counterpart, as follows,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.24)
     @xmath      (2.2.25)
     @xmath      (2.2.26)
     @xmath      (2.2.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

in addition with corresponding Hermitian conjugate relations. In this
base, we have the automorphism @xmath @xmath @xmath @xmath

As was for the bosinic case, one can use this structure as an approach
to the study of the super-harmonic oscillator system, whose
corresponding @xmath generators are

  -- -- -- ----------
           (2.2.28)
  -- -- -- ----------

where @xmath . The super-Hamiltonian @xmath is a composition of two
copies of an harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian, displaced from each other.
On the other hand, from the perspective of the Darboux transformation,
the seed states used to construct the fermionic operators @xmath and
@xmath are @xmath and @xmath respectively, see [ Inzunza and Plyushchay
( 2018 ) ] , and as a consequence, both resulting systems @xmath and
@xmath have the exact Poincaré supersymmetry, in contrast to the AFF
case, since @xmath . Finally, the intertwining operators are reduced to
the usual harmonic oscillator ladder operators,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.29)
  -- -------- -- ----------

A radical difference with the super-extended AFF model is that for the
super-harmonic oscillator system we can also build the additional
operators

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.30)
  -- -------- -- ----------

that supplement the @xmath superalgebra with the (anti)-commutation
relations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.2.31)
     @xmath      (2.2.32)
     @xmath      (2.2.33)
     @xmath      (2.2.34)
     @xmath      (2.2.35)
     @xmath      (2.2.36)
     @xmath      (2.2.37)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Again, operators ( 2.2.30 ) do not commute with @xmath so in the
Heisenberg picture we will have the dynamical integrals @xmath and
@xmath .

Note that generators @xmath produce an ideal sub-supergebra, which we
identify with the natural super-extension of Heisenberg’s symmetry. In
fact, the superalgebraic structure generated by ( 2.2.28 ), along with
the Eqs. ( 2.2.31 )-( 2.2.37 ) is a semi-direct sum of this
super-Heisenberg symmetry and the superalgebra @xmath , corresponding to
an @xmath super-extension of the Schrödinger symmetry [ Beckers and
Hussin ( 1986 ); Beckers et al. ( 1987 ); Inzunza and Plyushchay ( 2018
) ] .

### 2.3 The zero frequency limit

In this paragraph we take the limit @xmath in supersymmetric generators
introduced in last section, getting new @xmath super-extended systems.
We start with the supersymmetric AFF model generators, but now we
consider the basis

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.1)
     @xmath      (2.3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The generators defined in this way satisfy

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.3)
     @xmath      (2.3.4)
     @xmath      (2.3.5)
     @xmath      (2.3.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This is the usual way in which the superalgebra @xmath is presented for
supersymmetric extensions of the conformal model ( 2.1.1 ) at the
quantum level [ Leiva and Plyushchay ( 2003 ); Fedoruk et al. ( 2012 ) ]
. So it is not a surprise that at the zero frequency limit we get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.3.7)
     @xmath      (2.3.8)
     @xmath      (2.3.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath and @xmath .

We can repeat this procedure for the super-Schrödinger symmetry, which
we have derived for the super-harmonic oscillator system. In this case
the generators

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

reflect the superconformal symmetry of the super-extended free particle,
which in turn includes the additional integrals @xmath , @xmath and

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (2.3.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Together, generators @xmath produce the super-Schrödinger symmetry, now
for the super-free particle system [ Aizawa ( 2011 ); Inzunza and
Plyushchay ( 2018 ) ] ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
                 (2.3.12)
     @xmath      (2.3.13)
     @xmath      (2.3.14)
     @xmath      (2.3.15)
     @xmath      (2.3.16)
     @xmath      (2.3.17)
     @xmath      (2.3.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

### 2.4 Remarks

In this chapter we have considered one-dimensional conformal and an
@xmath super-conformal mechanical models. In the bosonic case, there are
many models that share the same conformal symmetry and some examples are
the charged particle in a Dirac monopole background, Landau problem,
rational Calogero models of @xmath particles, geodesic motion in extreme
black holes, the free particle and the harmonic oscillator in @xmath
dimensions, to name a few. In particular, some systems in various
dimensions are especially rich thanks to the presence of conformal
symmetry. Such is the case of the rational Calogero model, which is not
only integrable, but also super-integrable, see [ Correa et al. ( 2014 )
] and references therein. On the other hand, higher extensions of
superconformal models are also a regular topic in scientific literature
[ Akulov and Pashnev ( 1983 ); Fubini and Rabinovici ( 1984 ); Ivanov
et al. ( 1989 ); Donets et al. ( 2000 ); Fedoruk et al. ( 2012 ) ] .

In Sec 2.1 we have emphasized that the models ( 2.1.1 ) and ( 2.1.15 )
represent two different forms of dynamics associated with conformal
algebra. In the next chapter we will show that there is a non-unitary
mapping between both models. We call it the conformal bridge
transformation, and it might be useful to obtain hidden symmetries for
higher dimensional conformal invariant models.

## Chapter 3 The conformal bridge

As we highlighted in the previous chapter, the conformal invariant
systems with or without a harmonic potential are just two different
dynamical phases of the same algebraic structure. However, there seems
to be no direct relationship at the eigenstate level because one of the
Hamiltonians is a non-compact generator, in contrast to the another
Hamiltonian (the harmonically trapped one), which is compact. The
objective of this chapter is to show that there is a non-unitary
transformation that effectively maps one quantum mechanical system to
the other but in an unorthodox way. To do so, let us start with algebra
( 2.0.1 ) without specifying a particular form of the generators. Then
we construct the operators

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.0.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which from now on we will call as “conformal bridge”, because by means
of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.0.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

one can show that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.0.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Here, @xmath and @xmath correspond to the generators of the @xmath
algebra given in ( 2.0.4 ). Note that the transformed generators in (
3.0.3 ) still satisfy the @xmath symmetry, i.e., the transformation is
an automorphism of the algebra.

Anyway, as we showed in the previous chapter, for the one-dimensional
case @xmath could represent the Hamiltonian of a free particle or that
of the model ( 2.1.1 ) and on the other hand, @xmath could be the
Hamiltonian of an harmonic oscillator or that of the AFF model.
Therefore, the conformal bridge transformation produces a mapping
between these two forms of dynamics as follows: the formal eigenstates
of @xmath are transformed into those of @xmath , and on the other hand,
eigenstates of @xmath are mapped to eigenstates of the lowering operator
@xmath , which are in turns coherent states for @xmath . Of course,
these statements remain true for any other higher-dimensional
representation of the generators. In the following sections we explore
the scope of this transformation with examples in one and two
dimensions.

The content of this chapter is based on [ Inzunza et al. ( 2020b ) ] .
Here we only consider the basic elements and important results related
with quantum mechanics examples, even though construction can be
extended to the classical level, as we briefly discus in Sec. 3.4 .

### 3.1 Free particle/ harmonic oscillator conformal bridge

Let us identify @xmath with @xmath and @xmath , @xmath and @xmath with
the free particle conformal symmetry generators in the Schrödinger
picture ( @xmath ),

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Then, the conformal bridge takes the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

besides @xmath and @xmath are the symmetry generators of the harmonic
oscillator,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

As we saw in the previous chapter, these operators are well defined for
@xmath , and there are many more symmetries for these systems. In the
case of the free particle we have the momentum operator @xmath and the
Galilean boost, which in the Schrödinger picture at @xmath is just
@xmath . These objects are connected with the Heisenberg generators
@xmath , appearing in ( 3.1.3 ), via the conformal bridge as follow

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and, therefore, the transformation is also an automorphism of the
Schrödinger symmetry.

For the sake of simplicity, we set @xmath along the rest of this
chapter.

The relation (the inverse Weierstrass transformation of a monomial)

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath are the Hermite polynomials, implies that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which are the eigenstates of @xmath with eigenvalues @xmath .

With the exception of @xmath and @xmath , which are annihilated by
@xmath , the functions @xmath are not solutions of the free particle
Schrödinger equation. They are in fact the rank @xmath Jordan states of
the zero energy, as the relations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.7)
     @xmath      (3.1.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

valid for @xmath , show us. If we set @xmath in these formulas, a
subsequent application of @xmath from the left produces 0 on the right
hand side of the equation, and for this reason the nonlocal operator in
( 3.1.5 ) produces a polynomial of order @xmath . Also these Jordan
states satisfy the equation @xmath , so it is not really a surprise that
after applying @xmath , one obtains the harmonic oscillator eigenstates.

Now let us put our attention to the plane waves. We know that the
functions @xmath are eigenstates of the free particle with energy @xmath
, then the application of @xmath produces

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.1.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

These funtions are eigenstates of @xmath and @xmath , and up to a
normalization factor, they are coherent states of @xmath , [ Schrödinger
( 1926 ); Klauder and Skagerstam ( 1985 ); Gazeau ( 2009 ) ] . In fact,
by applying the evolution operator @xmath one gets @xmath which is a
solution of the harmonic oscillator time-dependent Schrödinger equation.
To obtain the over-complete set of coherent states, an analytical
continuation in @xmath must be done, allowing complex values.

From these results one can formulate a general recipe:

-   Under the conformal bridge transformation, the formal states of the
    operator @xmath , that are also the rank @xmath Jordan state of zero
    energy, are mapped to normalizable eigenstates of @xmath .

-   Eigenstates of the Hamiltonian @xmath are transformed into coherent
    states of the system @xmath , which are eigenstates of @xmath and
    conserve their form with time evolution. To have the overcomplete
    set, negative energy solutions (complex @xmath ) should be also
    considered in this map.

-   The conformal bridge also serves to map other symmetries from one
    system to another, as was the case for generators of the Heisenberg
    algebra ( 3.1.4 ).

In [ Inzunza et al. ( 2020b ) ] , it is shown how to obtain the squeezed
states by applying the conformal bridge to Gaussian packets, and there
is also an interesting discussion about the relation of this
transformation and the Stone-von Newman theorem [ Takhtadzhian ( 2008 )
] . Nevertheless, we prefer to not dwell with these details here.

### 3.2 Conformal bridge and the AFF model

Let us now set up @xmath as the Hamiltonian operator of the two-body
Calogero model with omitted center of mass degree of freedom

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

besides @xmath and @xmath take the same form given in ( 3.1.1 ). With
this choice, the conformal bridge is also labeled by @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and operators @xmath , @xmath are now

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Following the recipe described above, we look for the zero energy
solutions and its Jordan states, then consider the set of functions
@xmath , @xmath . The function with @xmath represents a formal,
diverging at infinity, eigenstate of the differential operator @xmath
with @xmath of eigenvalue @xmath . For @xmath this functions are the
Jordan states of rank @xmath corresponding to the same eigenvalue of
@xmath . The functions @xmath are at the same time eigenstates of the
operator @xmath with eigenvalues @xmath . The Jordan states with @xmath
satisfy the relations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which can be proved by induction. Eq. ( 3.2.4 ) extends to the case
@xmath giving @xmath due to appearing of a simple pole in the
denominator. Using relation ( 3.2.4 ) one can compute the conformal
bridge transformation in functions @xmath , which gives

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where eigenstates @xmath correspond to ( 2.1.26 ) (with @xmath and
@xmath ).

On the other hand, application of the operator @xmath to the eigenstates
( 2.1.12 ) (with @xmath ) of the system @xmath gives

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

These are the coherent states of the AFF model [ Perelomov ( 2012 ) ] ,
which satisfy

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

By allowing the @xmath to become a complex parameter @xmath , coherent
states can be constructed with complex eigenvalues of the operator
@xmath . Application of the evolution operator @xmath to these states
gives the time-dependent coherent states

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath . In the case of @xmath , these time-dependent coherent
states of the AFF model are the odd Schrödinger cat states of the
quantum harmonic oscillator [ Dodonov et al. ( 1974 ) ] ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.2.9)

### 3.3 The conformal bridge and Landau problem

The generalization of the conformal bridge between free particle and
harmonic oscillator to the @xmath dimensional case is straightforward;
since the problem is separable in Cartesian coordinates, the conformal
bridge operator is just @xmath . Each @xmath touch only the objects
constructed in terms of @xmath and @xmath , leaving invariant the other
coordinates. On the other hand, as both systems posses the @xmath
symmetry, the generalized angular momentum tensor @xmath remains intact
after the similarity transformation.

On the other hand, a nontrivial relation between two-dimensional free
particle, whose conformal symmetry generators are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and the Landau problem in the symmetric gauge, can be established by
means of the two-dimensional conformal bridge operator

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath and @xmath of the form ( 3.1.2 ). This is the subject of
this section.

Consider now the Landau problem for a scalar particle on @xmath . In the
symmetric gauge @xmath , the Hamiltonian operator (in units @xmath ) is
given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Assuming @xmath , this operator can be factorized as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.4)
     @xmath      (3.3.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Setting @xmath , we can identify @xmath with dimensionless variables
@xmath , @xmath . Then we present @xmath as linear combinations of the
usually defined ladder operators @xmath and @xmath (the shape of which
corresponds to the third equation in ( 3.1.3 )), in terms of which we
also define the operators @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The operators @xmath satisfy relation @xmath , and commute with @xmath .
They are integrals of motion, and their non-commuting Hermitian linear
combinations @xmath and @xmath are identified with the coordinates of
the center of the cyclotron motion. In terms of the ladder operators
@xmath , @xmath the Hamiltonian @xmath takes the form of a linear
combination of the Hamiltonian of the isotropic oscillator @xmath and
angular momentum operator @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

On the other hand, @xmath and @xmath are presented in terms of @xmath
and @xmath as follows,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and we have the commutation relations @xmath @xmath By taking into
account the invariance of the angular momentum under similarity
transformation, we find that its linear combination with the dilatation
operator is transformed into the Hamiltonian of the Landau problem,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.3.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Let us now introduce complex coordinate in the plane,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The elements of conformal algebra and angular momentum operator take
then the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and we find that the operator ( 3.3.2 ) generates the similarity
transformations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.12)
     @xmath      (3.3.13)
     @xmath      (3.3.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Observe that each pair of relations in ( 3.3.12 ) and ( 3.3.13 ) has a
form similar as the one-dimensional transformation ( 3.1.4 ), where,
however, the coordinate and momentum are Hermitian operators.

Simultaneous eigenstates of the operators @xmath and @xmath , which
satisfy the relations @xmath and @xmath with @xmath , are

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the binomial theorem has been used. Employing Eq. ( 3.3.11 ) we
find that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.16)
     @xmath      (3.3.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The last equality shows that @xmath and @xmath are the zero energy
eigenstates of the two-dimensional free particle, while the @xmath with
@xmath are the Jordan states corresponding to the same zero energy
value. Application of the operator @xmath to these functions yields

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

are the complex Hermite polynomials, see [ Ghanmi ( 2012 ) ] . These
functions are eigenstates of the operators @xmath , @xmath and @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.20)
     @xmath      (3.3.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and we note that @xmath is rotational invariant.

Eqs. ( 3.3.12 ), ( 3.3.13 ), and ( 3.3.17 ) show that the operators
@xmath and @xmath act as the ladder operators for the indexes @xmath and
@xmath , respectively, while the operators @xmath , increase or decrease
simultaneously @xmath and @xmath by one.

Application of the operator @xmath to exponential functions of the most
general form @xmath with @xmath gives here, similarly to the
one-dimensional case, the coherent states of the Landau problem as well
of the isotropic harmonic oscillator,

  -- -- -- ----------
           (3.3.22)
  -- -- -- ----------

Applying to them, in particular, the evolution operator @xmath , we
obtain the time dependent solution to the Landau problem,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

whereas under rotations these states transform as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As the function @xmath is a common eigenstate of the differential
operators @xmath and @xmath with eigenvalues @xmath and @xmath ,
respectively, then our transformation yields

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (3.3.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

that provides another explanation why the wave functions ( 3.3.22 ) are
the coherent states for the planar harmonic oscillator as well as for
the Landau problem.

### 3.4 Remarks

Note that if we apply @xmath from the right to the equations in ( 3.0.3
), we get intertwining relations of the form

  -- -- -- ---------
           (3.4.1)
  -- -- -- ---------

which are very similar to the usual intertwining relations of the
supersymmetric quantum mechanics, however, here the “intertwining
operators” are nonlocal and non-unitary operators described by an
infinite series of powers of second derivatives. This is the reason why
non-normalizable functions are mapped to bound states and vice-versa.

One can go further and try to obtain a classical version of the
conformal bridge by using “Hamiltonian flows” of the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.4.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath represents a symmetry generator, @xmath is a transformation
parameter and @xmath corresponds to a function on phase space. The
composed transformation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.4.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with the election

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (3.4.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is the classical analog, the operator ( 3.0.1 ) (generators should be
fixed at @xmath ). This is a complex canonical transformation, so one
should expect that there is some relation with @xmath symmetry [ Dorey
et al. ( 2001 ); Bender ( 2007 ); El-Ganainy et al. ( 2018 ) ] .
Actually, in the case of the classical bridge between free particle and
harmonic oscillator, the function @xmath , i.e, the “imaginary” flux of
@xmath due to @xmath , is the one that is mapped to a complex
combination of position and momentum of the harmonic oscillator.
Besides, the transformation of the free particle trajectory does not
have a clear interpretation.

Finally it is worth emphasizing that Hamiltonians of the form @xmath
have found application in mathematics, namely, in the study of Riemann
hypothesis, see [ Connes ( 1999 ); Berry and Keating ( 1999 ); Regniers
and Van der Jeugt ( 2010 ); Sierra and Rodriguez-Laguna ( 2011 ); Bender
et al. ( 2017 ) ] .

## Chapter 4 Hidden bosonized superconformal symmetry

It is well known that the one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator
system is characterized by a bosonized superconformal symmetry [
de Crombrugghe and Rittenberg ( 1983 ); Balantekin et al. ( 1988 );
Cariñena and Plyushchay ( 2016a ); Bonezzi et al. ( 2017 ) ] , however,
the origin of this symmetry had not been clarified, until the article [
Inzunza and Plyushchay ( 2018 ) ] appeared, and this chapters summarize
the main results of that work. We show that this supersymmetry can be
derived by applying a nonlocal transformation (of the nature of a
Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation) to a particular super-extended system.
The latter system itself can not be obtained directly from a given
superpotential, i.e., is outside of the Darboux transformation scheme,
however its corresponding generators are, in fact, linear combinations
of the @xmath symmetry generators that the super-harmonic oscillator
system possesses. They were introduced in Chap 2 , Sec. 2.2 . The
mentioned system can also be obtained by taking a certain limit in an
isospectral deformation of the harmonic oscillator, produced with a
confluent Darboux transformation.

### 4.1 Dimensionless generators

So far we have turned our attention to Hamiltonian operators of the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the potential of the harmonic oscillator or that of the
AFF model. However, when we are working with the DCKA transformation, it
is worth using dimensionless operators. For this reason, we consider the
change of variables @xmath , in term of which the Hamiltonian ( 4.1.1 )
takes the form @xmath , where depending on the situation we are looking
at, the operator @xmath as well as its eigenstates and its spectrum
could be

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

or

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.3)
     @xmath      (4.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It is also convenient to redefine the first order ladder operators of
the harmonic oscillator as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and the same for the second order ladder operators of the AFF system
which are now given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.1.6)
     @xmath      (4.1.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In the Heisenberg picture operators @xmath and @xmath are respectively
replaced by @xmath and @xmath , which will be dynamical integrals of
motion for the corresponding systems.

### 4.2 Hidden superconformal symmetry of the quantum harmonic
oscillator

In this paragraph we show how the aforementioned superconformal symmetry
appears for the one-dimensional bosonic harmonic oscillator system, the
Hamiltonian of which is given by ( 4.1.2 ).

As the ladder operators ( 4.1.5 ) anticommute with reflection operator
@xmath defined by @xmath , @xmath , and their anti-commutator produces
@xmath , it is clear that if one set @xmath as the @xmath -grading
operator, then:

-   @xmath are identified as odd, fermionic generators,

-   @xmath and quadratic operators @xmath are identified as even,
    bosonic generators since @xmath .

Consider now the dynamical integrals of motion

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

They produce the (anti)commutator relations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.2)
     @xmath      (4.2.3)
     @xmath      (4.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The superalgebra ( 4.2.2 ), ( 4.2.3 ), ( 4.2.4 ) describes the hidden
superconformal @xmath symmetry of the quantum harmonic oscillator [
de Crombrugghe and Rittenberg ( 1983 ); Balantekin et al. ( 1988 ) ] .
The set of even integrals @xmath , @xmath generates the @xmath
subalgebra ( 4.2.2 ), and relations ( 4.2.4 ) mean that fermionic
generators @xmath form a spin- @xmath representation of this Lie
subalgebra. One can extend this superalgebra by introducing the
fermionic operators

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which give rise to the additional super-algebraic relations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.6)
     @xmath      (4.2.7)
     @xmath      (4.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.2.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

However this extension is nonlocal since @xmath can be presented as
@xmath .

We will show soon that superalgebra given by Eqs. ( 4.2.2 )-( 4.2.4 )
and ( 4.2.6 )-( 4.2.8 ) is just another basis for the @xmath
superconformal algebra presented in Chap. 2 , Sec 2.2 .

### 4.3 Extended system with super-Schrödinger symmetry and nonlocal
Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation

The approach with nonlocal Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation and a
subsequent reduction was used to clarify the origin of the hidden
bosonized supersymmetry (that is outside the conformal symmetry) in [
Gamboa et al. ( 1999 ); Jakubskỳ et al. ( 2010 ) ] , and in this section
we demonstrate that the bosonized superconformal symmetry introduced
above can be “extracted” from the symmetry generators of the extended
quantum harmonic oscillator system described by the matrix Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It is natural to identify the diagonal matrix @xmath as a @xmath
-grading operator, implying that Hamiltonian ( 4.3.1 ) is an even
generator, besides the anti-diagonal integrals @xmath , @xmath , can be
considered as odd supercharges. The peculiarity of the system ( 4.3.1 )
is that these supercharges anticommute not for Hamiltonian but for
central element, @xmath , @xmath . On the other hand, all the energy
levels of the extended system @xmath (including the lowest @xmath ) are
doubly degenerate. Furthermore, neither the supercharges nor the
Hamiltonian can annihilate any eigenstate or linear combination of them,
so the system is in the spontaneously broken supersymmetric phase.
Additionally, one can also construct the dynamical integrals

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.3.2)
     @xmath      (4.3.3)
     @xmath      (4.3.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Diagonal operators @xmath and @xmath are identified here as even
generators, and antidiagonal dynamical integrals @xmath and @xmath are
odd. All these generators produce the superalgebra :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.3.5)
     @xmath      (4.3.6)
     @xmath      (4.3.7)
                 (4.3.8)
     @xmath      (4.3.9)
     @xmath      (4.3.10)
     @xmath      (4.3.11)
     @xmath      (4.3.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.3.13)
     @xmath      (4.3.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The not shown (anti)commutators between generators are equal to zero.
The system presented here cannot be obtained by the usual Darboux
transformation procedure, since it is not possible to find a
superpotential, so that the potentials relative to the superpartners are
exactly @xmath , see [ Inzunza and Plyushchay ( 2018 ) ] . However, when
considering the base change

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.3.15)
     @xmath      (4.3.16)
     @xmath      (4.3.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and identifying @xmath with the generator of the @xmath symmetry, one
realizes that the generators defined in this way satisfy the @xmath
superconformal algebra ( 2.2.16 )-( 2.2.22 ). Actually, the generators (
4.3.16 ) - ( 4.3.17 ) match with @xmath and @xmath in ( 2.2.28 ) when
@xmath ¹ ¹ 1 putting @xmath and therefore @xmath . , and in addition,
the operators @xmath and @xmath are, up to a proportionality factor, the
generators of Heisenberg’s superextended symmetry. With this information
at hand we identify ( 4.3.5 )-( 4.3.12 ) as another expression for
super-Schrödinger symmetry.

By comparing with what we have in the previous section, it is obvious
that the matrix integrals @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath of
the extended system ( 4.3.1 ) are analogous to the corresponding
integrals @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath of the quantum
harmonic oscillator. Because of the extension, the nonlocal integrals
@xmath and @xmath of the system ( 4.1.2 ) are changed here for the
corresponding local matrix integrals @xmath and @xmath . The
anti-commutator of additional fermionic integrals @xmath with @xmath
generates a central charge @xmath , and via the anti-commutators with
odd dynamical integrals @xmath and @xmath they produce additional
bosonic integrals @xmath , see Eq. ( 4.3.8 ).

The comparison of the symmetries and generators of the systems ( 4.3.1 )
and ( 4.1.2 ) indicates that the local @xmath and nonlocal @xmath hidden
superconformal symmetries of the quantum harmonic oscillator can be
obtained by a certain projection (reduction) of the local symmetries of
the matrix system ( 4.3.1 ). To find the exact relation between these
two systems and their symmetries, we apply to the extended system a
unitary transformation @xmath generated by the nonlocal matrix operator

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.3.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Under this transformation, the central element @xmath and generators of
the @xmath subalgebra, @xmath and @xmath , do not change, while other
generators take the following form :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.3.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.3.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.3.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Note that the transformation diagonalizes the dynamical odd integrals
@xmath and @xmath which initially have had the anti-diagonal form.
Therefore, the transformation is of the same nature as a
Foldy-Wouthuysen @xmath transformation @xmath for @xmath a @xmath Dirac
@xmath particle @xmath in @xmath external @xmath electromagnetic @xmath
field @xmath [ Foldy and Wouthuysen ( 1950 ) ] . On the other hand, the
transformed even, @xmath , and odd, @xmath , generators of the
super-extended Schrödinger symmetry of the system ( 4.3.1 ) take a
nonlocal form. We can reduce (or, in other words, project) the
transformed system and its symmetries to the proper subspace of
eigenvalue @xmath of the matrix @xmath which corresponds, according to
Eq. ( 4.3.13 ), to the single (non-extended) quantum harmonic oscillator
system. In this procedure (which can be done using projector @xmath ) we
looses operators @xmath and @xmath because they are anti-diagonal, but
on the other hand, we retrieve all the generators of the bosonized
superconformal symmetry given in the previous section.

### 4.4 Two-step isospectral Darboux chain

As we have indicated previously, the extended system ( 4.3.1 ) cannot be
produced by means of the usual supersymmetric algorithm based on some
superpotential @xmath . In this section we will show that an option to
generate this system is through a two-step confluent Darboux
transformation: The extended system obtained in this way will have a set
of true and dynamical integrals of motion, and after the application of
a certain limit, these integrals will give us the generators of the
super-extended Schrödinger symmetry related to ( 4.3.1 ).

Consider the functions @xmath , which is the normalized ground state of
( 4.1.2 ), and @xmath , given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.4.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a Jordan state of energy @xmath , whose form corresponds
to ( 1.3.3 ), and @xmath is a real constant. By construction @xmath
satisfy @xmath with @xmath , and the application of @xmath on it gives
us

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.4.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a nonphysical eigenstate of @xmath with negative energy
@xmath and @xmath is its corresponding linear independent partner
constructed according to ( 1.1.7 ).

If we choose the value of parameter @xmath in one of the infinite
intervals @xmath or @xmath for which @xmath is a nodeless on a real line
function being a nonphysical eigenstate of @xmath of zero eigenvalue,
@xmath , then we can use it as a seed state for a new Darboux
transformation which produces the first order differential operators

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.4.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.4.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

These operators factorize @xmath and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.4.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

@xmath , @xmath , and intertwine them, @xmath , @xmath . Considering the
second order differential operators given by a composition of the first
order Darboux generators,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.4.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

we find that they intertwine the Hamiltonian operators @xmath and @xmath
,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.4.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and also satisfy relations @xmath , @xmath . By construction,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.4.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The Darboux-deformed oscillator system described by the Hamiltonian
operator @xmath is completely isospectral to the system @xmath . Its
eigenstates with eigenvalues @xmath , @xmath , are obtained by the
mapping @xmath : @xmath , @xmath . The (not normalized) ground state of
zero energy of the system @xmath is described by wave function @xmath ,
where @xmath corresponds to ( 4.4.2 ).

Thus, we obtained the completely isospectral pair @xmath and @xmath ,
from which we compose the extended system described by the matrix
Hamiltonian operator

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.4.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

On the other hand, @xmath and @xmath intertwine @xmath and @xmath ,
which implies

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.4.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

For this system we have in fact three Darboux schemes :

-   Scheme @xmath which provides us with the intertwining operator
    @xmath .

-   Scheme @xmath , the intertwining operators of which are @xmath .

-   Scheme @xmath , which gives us the third order intertwining
    operators @xmath and @xmath , that satisfy @xmath , @xmath .

Using the intertwining operators of these three Darboux schemes, we
construct the odd integrals

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.4.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.4.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and by means of the relations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (4.4.13)
     @xmath      (4.4.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

we also construct diagonal (even) operators

  -- -- -- ----------
           (4.4.15)
  -- -- -- ----------

and Hermitian conjugate operators @xmath and @xmath . With respect to
the Hamiltonian @xmath , the only pair of time-independent integrals are
the supercharges @xmath , @xmath . To obtain dynamical integrals one
should unitary transform other operators with @xmath .

The generators considered here produce a kind of a nonlinear deformation
of the super-Schrödinger symmetry. We are not interested here in
explicit form of such a nonlinear superalgebra, but just note that when
@xmath , we have @xmath . As a result, in any of the two limits the
Hamiltonian @xmath transforms into @xmath , and the matrix Hamiltonian
transforms into extended Hamiltonian ( 4.3.1 ) shifted for the minus
unit matrix : @xmath . In this limit we also have @xmath , and find that
the constructed operators transform as follows :

  -- -------- -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      @xmath      (4.4.16)
     @xmath      @xmath      (4.4.17)
     @xmath      @xmath      (4.4.18)
     @xmath      @xmath      (4.4.19)
  -- -------- -- -------- -- ----------

In such a way we reproduce all the corresponding integrals of the system
( 4.3.1 ) that generate the super-extended Schrödinger symmetry lying
behind the hidden superconformal symmetries @xmath and @xmath of a
single quantum harmonic oscillator.

The isospectral deformation @xmath of the harmonic oscillator potential
is illustrated by Figure 4.1 , while Figure 4.2 illustrates the action
of the intertwining operators @xmath and @xmath .

In conclusion of this section we note that the Hamiltonian ( 4.4.9 ) and
the second order intertwining operators @xmath can be presented in
alternative form which corresponds to the anomaly-free scheme of
quantization of classical systems with second-order supersymmetry [
Plyushchay ( 2017 ) ] . For this we introduce the quasi-amplitude [
Brezhnev ( 2008 ) ]

  -- -------- -- ----------

It is a square root of the product of two nonphysical eigenstates of
eigenvalue @xmath of the quantum harmonic oscillator @xmath . The
rescaled function @xmath transforms in the limit @xmath into the
nonphysical eigenstate @xmath . This function satisfies Ermakov-Pinney
equation [ Ermakov ( 1880 ); Milne ( 1930 ); Pinney ( 1950 ); Cariñena
and De Lucas ( 2011 ) ]

2017 ) ] .

### 4.5 Remarks

Along with the harmonic oscillator, there are many bosonic systems that
have hidden bosonized supersymmetry and the idea of the Foldy-Wouthuysen
transformation is not new, see [ Plyushchay ( 1996 ) ; Plyushchay (
2000a ) ; Gamboa et al. ( 1999 ) ; Correa and Plyushchay ( 2007 ) ;
Correa et al. ( 2008 ) ; Jakubskỳ et al. ( 2010 ) ] . In fact, one can
use the transformation ( 4.3.18 ) in the generators of the
super-extended free particle given in Chap. 2 , Sec. 2.3 , to obtain the
hidden superconformal symmetry of the bosonic free particle.

The exotic feature here is the supersymmetric system from where we get
the bosonic superalgebra which, in principle, does not correspond to the
Darboux transformation scheme. However, it is possible to obtain such a
system starting from the classical level: Consider a classical system
described by a Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.5.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with superpotential @xmath , where @xmath is a constant, besides @xmath
and @xmath are Grassmann variables with a nonzero Poisson bracket @xmath
, that after quantization are realized as the creation-annihilation
fermionic operators @xmath . A direct quantum analog of this system is a
composition of two isospecral systems and is in the phase of
spontaneously broken supersymmetry, with nonsingular superpartner
potentials @xmath . The spectrum of subsystems is different from that of
the quantum harmonic oscillator. On the other hand, if before the
quantization we realize a canonical transformation @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath , where @xmath and @xmath [ Klishevich and Plyushchay ( 2001 );
Inzunza and Plyushchay ( 2018 ) ] , we obtain the canonically equivalent
form of the Hamiltonian @xmath . In the canonically transformed system,
the new classical Grassmann variables @xmath completely decouple and are
the odd integrals of motion with Poisson bracket @xmath . The
quantization of the canonically transformed system gives us exactly the
extended quantum system ( 4.3.1 ) shifted just for the additive constant
@xmath .

Another possibility is a “naive” application of the comformal bridge. To
do so, let us start by setting the super-Schrödinger symmetry generators
for the super-free particle system,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.5.2)
     @xmath      (4.5.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath . The conformal bridge transformation produces

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.5.4)
                 (4.5.5)
     @xmath      (4.5.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

that up to a complex proportionality constant, they match with the
generators presented in Sec. 4.3 at @xmath . The conformal bridge works
fine in this case because @xmath and its transformed version are matrix
generators containing two copies of the same differential operator. In
the general case, both superpartners are different from each other and
the transformation fails.

## Chapter 5 Rationally extended conformal mechanics

As we have shown in Chap. 1 , Sec. 1.2 , DCKA transformation allows us
to construct new quantum systems starting from a well known original
one. In this context, the systems that appear due to these
transformations applied to the harmonic oscillator are the rationally
extended harmonic oscillators, that is, a harmonic potential plus a
regular rational function of @xmath , and to obtain a well-defined
system, we have to follow some rules for selecting the set of seed
states for transformation. The selection rule that gives us a regular
potential is known as the Krein-Adler theorem, [ Krein ( 1957 ); Adler (
1994 ); Dubov et al. ( 1994 ); Quesne ( 2012 ); Gómez-Ullate et al. (
2013 ) ] . In the research carried out in the article [ Cariñena et al.
( 2018 ) ] , we found new selection rules to construct completely
isospectral rational extensions for the AFF model with integer coupling
constant @xmath , where @xmath , as well as deformations with gaps in
their spectrum. We also learned how to construct the spectrum-generating
ladder operators of these deformed systems by using what we call Darboux
dualities. The content presented in this chapter is a summary of the
results obtained in [ Cariñena et al. ( 2018 ) ] , an article that in
turn was inspired by previous research on rational deformations of the
harmonic oscillator [ Cariñena and Plyushchay ( 2017 ) ] .

Before to start, let us explain what a Darboux duality is with a simple
example: consider the half-harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian @xmath ¹ ¹ 1
This Hamiltonian is formally ( 4.1.2 ), but defined in the domain @xmath
. The physical states are the odd eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator
system. . When the first @xmath physical states are considered as seed
states for the DCKA transformation, it is not difficult to show that the
resulting system is the AFF model @xmath , defined in ( 4.1.3 ), shifted
by the constant @xmath . Now, by performing the transformation @xmath in
the physical eigenstates, we produce new nonphysical solutions, and when
the first @xmath functions obtained in this way are taken as seed states
for the DCKA transformation, the resulting system is again @xmath but
now shifted by the positive constant @xmath . So both Darboux
transformation schemes generate essentially the same quantum system, and
in this sense we call them as dual Darboux schemes. The intertwining
operators of both dual schemes are independent of each other and it can
be shown that operators constructed by means of products of these
intertwiners are equivalent to powers of @xmath generators [ Cariñena
et al. ( 2018 ) ] .

Here we study rational extended systems built on the basis of the
half-harmonic oscillator, and for simplicity, we present the following
notation to refer to the physical and nonphysical eigenstates of the
quantum harmonic oscillator system (from now on QHO),

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.0.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

### 5.1 Generation of rationally extended systems

Rational deformations (extensions) of the QHO system are constructed
following the Krein-Adler theorem [ Krein ( 1957 ); Adler ( 1994 ) ] ,
which ensures that the Wronskian of the seed states (or henceforth
Darboux scheme) @xmath , where the numbers @xmath , @xmath , indicate
the chosen seed states, see notations ( 5.0.1 ), does not have zeros on
the real axis. The corresponding DCKA transformation produces

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath and @xmath are even polynomials, with @xmath taking
positive values on real line and having degree higher by two of degree
of @xmath . According with Chap. 1 , the spectrum of the system ( 5.1.1
) is almost isospectral to the QHO spectrum: there are missing energy
levels or gaps, related to the energy levels corresponding to seed
states.

On the other hand, deformations of the AFF model @xmath can be obtained
from the half-harmonic oscillator by considering the scheme @xmath ,
where even indexes inside the set @xmath represent nonphysical
eigenstates of @xmath and @xmath , @xmath , are identified as @xmath odd
states which were not considered in the first set of @xmath states. The
Hamiltonian operator

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

appears as a final result of the DCKA transformation, where polynomials
@xmath and @xmath have the properties similar to those of @xmath and
@xmath in ( 5.1.1 ). Note that in this way we can only construct
deformations of @xmath . Rational deformations of @xmath , with
arbitrary values for parameter @xmath , cannot be connected with the
harmonic oscillator as we did here, and the issue about their
construction is discussed properly in Chap. 7 . In general such a system
has gaps in its spectrum. If, however, the set @xmath contains all the
@xmath odd indexes from @xmath to @xmath , the generated deformed AFF
system will have no gaps in its spectrum and we obtain a system
completely isospectral to @xmath . Such completely isospectral (gapless)
deformations in the QHO case are only possible if we include Jordan
states in the construction.

The mirror diagram method developed and used in [ Cariñena et al. ( 2018
) ] is a technique such that a dual scheme with nonphysical “negative”
eigenstates ( 5.0.1 ), is derived from a “positive” scheme with physical
states of @xmath and, vice-versa. This can be done by using the
algorithmic procedure described in Appendix B.1 and the final picture is
the following:

-   For a given positive scheme @xmath , where @xmath with @xmath , one
    gets the negative scheme @xmath , where @xmath , means that the
    corresponding number @xmath is omitted from the set @xmath .

-   If we have instead the negative scheme @xmath , where @xmath with
    @xmath , one obtains the positive scheme @xmath , where symbols
    @xmath represent again the states missing from the list of the
    chosen seed states.

Obviously, Darboux scheme must be constructed in such a way that the
generated Hamiltonian is a non-singular operator, that is, by means of
the rules discussed above. Then, having two dual schemes on hand, the
relation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is valid modulo a multiplicative constant. From here one can see that
the Hamiltonians of dual schemes satisfy

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath and @xmath correspond to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

On the other hand, the intertwining operators @xmath and @xmath that
correspond to each scheme are constructed following ( 1.2.5 ), however,
we prefer to use the more generic notation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

By means of the negative scheme we do not eliminate any energy level
from the spectrum, but instead energy levels can be introduced, but not
obligatorily, in its lower part. In the particular special case of
completely isospectral deformations of the (shifted) @xmath systems, all
@xmath seed states composing negative scheme are nonphysical odd
eigenstates of @xmath , and the transformation does not introduce any
additional energy level.

The construction of the mirror diagram can be better understood with the
following example: Consider the illustration in figure 5.1 . In the
upper line we have represented the first eleven physical eigenstates of
the harmonic oscillator by circles, where the black ones are the seed
states of the positive scheme @xmath , which produces a system of the
type ( 5.1.2 ). In a similar way, the first eleven nonphysical states
with negative energy are indicated by the circles in the bottom line,
and the marked ones are the seed states of the corresponding dual
negative scheme. In general, when considering a scheme of the form
@xmath , in the upper line we ordered from left to right all the
physical state from @xmath to @xmath , besides in the bottom line we set
from right to left all the states between @xmath to @xmath . After
marking the states of the positive scheme, the construction of the
negative scheme is by means of a sort of an “anti-reflection”
transformation with respect to an imaginary line in the center, that is
parallel to the other two lines. The construction of the positive scheme
from the negative one is analogous.

This construction seems to be related with the Maya diagram formalism,
for a review see Gómez-Ullate and Milson ( 2019 ) . However, our
technique is completely based on the existence of the first-order ladder
operators and their relationship with the Darboux transformation (this
is the key to its generalization for the AFF model in Chap. 7 ), besides
for the Maya diagrams it is important to study the proprieties of an
additional structure called the pseudo-Wronskian, which we do not
introduce in our work.

### 5.2 Spectrum-generating ladder operators: completely isospectral
case

In this section we explore the possibilities of constructing
spectrum-generating ladder operators for rationally extended isospectral
systems. We start with the simplest example and then expand on the ideas
for the general case.

Consider the simplest deformed AFF system generated via the Darboux
transformation based on the nonphysical eigenstate @xmath of the
half-harmonic oscillator @xmath . The resulting Hamiltonian takes the
form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

By the method of the mirror diagram, we find that up to a constant
shift, the system can be generated alternatively by the DCKA
transformation based on the set @xmath ² ² 2 The state @xmath is not a
physical state of the half-harmonic oscillator @xmath . ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The intertwiners of the negative scheme are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

They provide us the factorization relations @xmath @xmath . In
correspondence with them, @xmath intertwines the Hamiltonian operators
@xmath and @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and the intertwining relation for @xmath is obtained by Hermitian
conjugation.

The systems @xmath and @xmath are also intertwined by the third order
operators @xmath , where the operator @xmath is uniquely specified by
its kernel : @xmath . We have the intertwining relation @xmath , and the
conjugate relation for @xmath .

To construct ladder operators for this deformed system we can “Darboux
dress” the ladder operators of the half-harmonic oscillator which are
nothing else than @xmath . The first pairs of operators produced in this
way are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.2.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

These operators together with the Hamiltonian @xmath generate a
nonlinear deformation of the conformal symmetry given by the commutation
relations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The roots of the fourth order polynomial in the relation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

correspond to eigenstates of @xmath , which belong to the kernel of the
lowering operator,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The last state @xmath describes here the ground state of @xmath of
eigenvalue @xmath , and other states are nonphysical.

On the other hand, the roots in the product

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.2.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

correspond to eigenvalues of the eigenstates of @xmath which appear in
the kernel of the raising ladder operator,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.2.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

All the states in this kernel are nonphysical. In correspondence with
the described properties of the ladder operators ( 5.2.5 ) they are the
spectrum-generating ladder operators for the system @xmath : acting by
them on any physical eigenstate of @xmath , we can generate any other
physical eigenstate. The kernels of the ladder operators contain here
the same nonphysical eigenstate @xmath . Below we shall see that in the
case of non-isospectral rational deformations of the AFF system the
kernels of analogs of such lowering and raising ladder operators contain
some common physical eigenstates, see for example Figure 5.2 in next
section.

In a similar way, one can construct the ladder operators for @xmath via
Darboux-dressing of @xmath by the third order intertwining operators,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.2.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

However, these differential operators of order @xmath are not
independent and reduce to the fourth order ladder operators ( 5.2.5 )
multiplied by the second order polynomials in the Hamiltonian,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.2.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As the first and third order operators @xmath and @xmath intertwine the
half-harmonic oscillator with the system @xmath with a nonzero relative
shift, we can construct yet another pair of the ladder operators for the
quantum system @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.2.13)
     @xmath      (5.2.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The kernel of the lowering ladder operator is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.2.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Here @xmath and @xmath are the ground and the first exited states of
@xmath . On the other hand, all the states in the kernel of the raising
ladder operator are nonphysical :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.2.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As a result, the space of states of @xmath is separated into two
subspaces, on each of which the ladder operators @xmath and @xmath act
irreducibly. One subspace is spanned by the even eigenstates and the
another subspace corresponds to the odd eigenstates. The ladder
operators @xmath , unlike @xmath , are therefore not spectrum-generating
operators for the system @xmath . Notice that from the point of view of
the basic properties of the ladder operators @xmath , they are similar
to the operators @xmath in the case of the half-harmonic oscillator
@xmath . The essential difference here, however, is that the ladder
operators @xmath are independent from the spectrum-generating ladder
operators @xmath and have the same differential order equal to four. We
shall see that for non-isospectral rational extensions of the AFF
systems the direct analogs of the operators @xmath will constitute an
inseparable part of the set of the spectrum-generating operators.

The described properties of this particular example are extended for the
general case of isospectral deformations and can be summarized as
follows. No matter what set of the @xmath odd nonphysical eigenstates of
the quantum harmonic oscillator we select, the lower order ladder
operators @xmath obtained by Darboux-dressing of the ladder operators of
the half-harmonic oscillator are spectrum-generating operators for the
rationally deformed AFF system. They commute for a polynomial of order
@xmath in the corresponding Hamiltonian with which they produce a
deformation of the conformal @xmath symmetry of the type of @xmath
-algebra [ de Boer et al. ( 1996 ) ] . Other spectrum-generating ladder
operators, which can be constructed on the basis of other DCKA schemes
via the Darbox-dressing procedure, act on physical states in the same
way as the operators @xmath of order @xmath , and are equal to them
modulo the multiplicative factor in the form of the polynomial in the
Hamiltonian operator of the system. The ladder operators @xmath
constructed by “gluing” intertwining operators of the two dual schemes
are not spectrum-generating. Particularly, for the isospectral
deformation of the system @xmath based on the set of the seed states
@xmath with @xmath , @xmath , the operator @xmath annihilates the lowest
@xmath states in the spectrum of the system.

### 5.3 Spectrum-generating ladder operators: non-isospectral case

As in the previous section, here we explore the construction of
spectrum-generating ladder operators for non-isospectral deformations of
the AFF system through a particular example, and then generalize the
ideas.

Let us start with Darboux’s positive scheme @xmath that we have already
used as example to explain the mirror diagram technique in Sec. 5.1 .
There we had already obtained the negative scheme which is @xmath .

After performing the DCKA transformation using the positive scheme, we
obtain the Hamiltonian operator

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The graph of the resulting potential and the quantum spectrum of the
system ( 5.3.1 ) are shown on Figure 5.2 .

The potential has three local minima and the system supports three
separated states in its spectrum which are organized in two “valence
bands” of one and two states. On the other hand, the dual scheme
produces the same Hamiltonian operator but shifted by a constant, @xmath
. The fact that the mutual shift of both Hamiltonians is proportional to
the difference of two consecutive energy levels in the spectrum of the
AFF model allows us to use below exactly the same rule for the
construction of the ladder operators of the type @xmath as in the
previous section. As we shall see, the number of physical states
annihilated by the lowering operator @xmath in this case is equal
exactly to six. Later, we also shall see that in some cases of the
rational gapped deformations of the AFF systems, the mutual shift of the
corresponding Hamiltonian operators can be equal to the half-integer
multiple of @xmath , and then the procedure for the construction of the
ladder operators of the type @xmath will require some modification.

In the DCKA construction of the Hamiltonian operator @xmath , the energy
levels corresponding to the physical seed eigenstates of the
half-harmonic oscillator @xmath were removed from the spectrum producing
two gaps. In the (up to a shifted constant) equivalent system @xmath
based on nonphysical seed eigenstates of @xmath , the energy levels were
added under the lowest energy of the ground state of @xmath . The
intertwining operators associated with the positive scheme @xmath have
differential order five, while the operators @xmath , obtained from the
negative scheme, have differential order eleven.

The three lowest physical states of the system ( 5.3.1 ) which
correspond to the three separated energy levels can be presented in two
equivalent forms

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where equalities are modulo a nonzero constant multiplier. We have here
the intertwining relations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and the conjugate relations for @xmath and @xmath .

Let us turn now to the construction of the ladder operators for the
system under consideration. Like in the isospectral case, here we have
two ways to realize Darboux-dressing of the ladder operators @xmath .
Using @xmath for this purpose , we obtain the operators of order twelve:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The kernel of @xmath contains three physical states @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath among other 9 nonphysical solutions with negative energy. They
correspond to the ground state, the lowest states in the isolated
“valence band”, and the first state in the equidistant part of the
spectrum, see Figure 5.2 . On the other hand @xmath annihilates @xmath ,
the upper state in the valance band @xmath and other 10 nonphysical
states. Then, due to the incapacity of these operators to connect the
isolates states with the equidistant part of the spectrum, it is obvious
that @xmath are not spectrum-generating.

We also can construct ladder operators by using @xmath instead,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

These are also not spectrum-generating operartors because the leap they
make does not allow to overcome the gaps. Operator @xmath detects all
the states in both separated valence bands by annihilating them. In
addition to the indicated physical states, the lowering operator @xmath
also annihilates the lowest state in the half-infinite equidistant part
of the spectrum.

Therefore, the essential difference of the non-isospectral rational
deformations of the AFF model from their isospectral rational extensions
is that there is no pair of spectrum-generating ladder operators
constructed via the Darboux-dressing procedure. This situation is
similar to that in the rationally extended QHO systems [ Cariñena and
Plyushchay ( 2017 ) ] .

We now construct the ladder operators @xmath by “gluing” the
intertwining operators of different types. As in the case of the
isospectral deformations, they also will not be the spectrum-generating
operators, but together with any pair of the ladder operators @xmath ,
or @xmath they will form a spectrum-generating set. So, let us consider

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

They are independent from the ladder operators constructed via the
Darboux-dressing procedure, and their commutator @xmath is a certain
polynomial of order @xmath in the Hamiltonian @xmath . The operators
@xmath divide the Hilbert space of the system into six infinite subsets
on which they act irreducibly: The @xmath transforms a physical
eigenstate into another physical eigenstate by making it skip six levels
below and annihilates the first six eigenstates of the spectrum. The
operator @xmath does not annihilate any physical state here and skip the
energy of an arbitrary state in to six levels above. Therefore they
connect the separated states with the equidistant part of the spectrum.

As a result, the pair @xmath together with any pair of the ladder
operators, @xmath or @xmath are the spectrum-generating set. Figure 5.3
illustrates the action of the ladder operators and show how we can use
them to obtain a particular state, starting from an arbitrary one.

All the described picture is generalized directly in the case when the
index of the last seed state used in the corresponding DCKA
transformation is odd. Then the corresponding scheme based on physical
eigenstates of @xmath is of the form @xmath , and the dual scheme is
@xmath . Following the same notation as we used in the particular
examples, the Hamiltonian operators generated in these two dual schemes
are shifted by the distance equal to the separation @xmath of energy
levels in the equidistant part of the spectrum times integer number
@xmath : @xmath , see ( 5.1.4 ), and the picture is the following:

-   Operators @xmath are of differential order @xmath . Rising and
    lowering operators of this kind annihilate all the states in the
    isolated valence bands, in the sense of a group of energy levels
    separated by a gap from the equidistant part of the spectrum. They
    act as regular ladder operators in the equidistant part of the
    spectrum.

-   Operators @xmath are of differential order @xmath . @xmath
    annihilates all the lowest states in each valence band and the
    lowest state in the equidistant part of the spectrum. The raising
    operator @xmath annihilates all the highest states in each valence
    band. They act in the same way as @xmath in the equidistant part of
    the spectrum.

-   Operators @xmath of the form ( 5.3.7 ) have a differential order
    @xmath , and their commutation with Hamiltonian produces:

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (5.3.8)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    Lowering operator @xmath annihilates @xmath physical states, where
    we find all of the isolated states and some exited states of the
    equidistant part. Rising operator @xmath does not annihilate any
    physical state.

When we have the schemes @xmath generating a gapped rational extension
of some AFF system, the corresponding Hamiltonian operators associated
with them are shifted mutually for the distance @xmath , that is equal
to the half-integer multiple of the energy spacing in the equidistant
part of the spectrum and in the valence bands with more than one state.
In this case the procedure related to the construction of the ladder
operators @xmath and @xmath and their properties are similar to those in
the systems generated by the schemes @xmath . However, the situation
with the construction of the ladder operators of the type @xmath in this
case is essentially different. We still can construct the operators
@xmath of the form ( 5.3.7 ). Such operators will be of odd differential
order @xmath , and their commutation relations with any of the
Hamiltonian operators @xmath and @xmath will be of the form @xmath .
This means that these operators acting on physical eigenstates of @xmath
will produce nonphysical eigenstates excepting the case when the
lowering operator @xmath acts on the states from its kernel. The square
of these operators will not have the indicated deficiency and will form
together with the ladder operators @xmath or @xmath the set of the
spectrum-generating operators. This picture can be compared with the
case of the half-harmonic oscillator @xmath , where the first order
differential operators @xmath will have the properties similar to those
of the described operators @xmath . In this case we can however modify
slightly the construction of the ladder operators of the @xmath type by
taking

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.3.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

These ladder operators satisfy the commutation relations @xmath , and
transform a particular physical states into other physical states with
different energy.

To conclude this section, let us summarize the structure of the
nonlinearly deformed conformal symmetry algebras generated by different
pairs of the corresponding ladder operators and Hamiltonians of the
rationally deformed conformal mechanics systems. The commutators of the
ladder operators @xmath , @xmath and @xmath with Hamiltonian operators
are given, respectively, by Eqs. ( 5.3.6 ), ( 5.3.5 ) and ( 5.3.7 ) with
@xmath . The commutation relations of the form ( 5.3.6 ) also are valid
for the case of the isospectral deformations discussed in the previous
section. To write down the commutation relations between raising and
lowering operators of the same type in general case, let us introduce
the polynomial functions

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath are the indices of the corresponding seed states in the
positive scheme and @xmath are the indices of the seed states in the
negative scheme. With this notation, we have the relations @xmath ,
@xmath , and @xmath , @xmath . Then we obtain

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.11)
     @xmath      (5.3.12)
     @xmath      (5.3.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath , and relation ( 5.3.11 ) also is valid in the case of
isospectral deformations. In the case of the non-isospectral
deformations given by the dual schemes @xmath , the corresponding
modified operators ( 5.3.9 ) satisfy the commutation relation

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (5.3.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Thus, in any rational deformation of the conformal mechanics model we
considered, each pair of the conjugate ladder operators of the types
@xmath , @xmath or @xmath generates a nonlinear deformation of the
conformal @xmath symmetry. The commutation relations between ladder
operators of different types of the form @xmath , etc. is considered in
next chapter, and their taking into account gives rise naturally to
different nonlinearly extended versions of the superconformal @xmath
symmetry [ Inzunza and Plyushchay ( 2019a ) ] .

### 5.4 Remarks

The construction of the spectrum-generating ladder operators can also be
explored by using intertwining operators between the final rational
extended model and some intermediate system in the Darboux chain. This
possibility was explored in [ Cariñena et al. ( 2018 ) ] . Anyway, the
final conclusion of this is that one always has a triad of pairs of
ladder operators @xmath , @xmath and @xmath which behaves as described
above. The only difference here is the number of nonphysical states that
appear in the corresponding kernels.

An unresolved question for us is if there is any relationship between
rationally extended systems and other systems of quantum mechanics, such
as the conformal model ( 2.1.1 ) or a @xmath deformation of it [
Mateos Guilarte and Plyushchay ( 2017 , 2019 ); Plyushchay ( 2020 ) ] ,
we are thinking of something like the conformal bridge. It can be
speculated that if such a relationship exists, it would be useful in
applications related to integrable systems of infinite degrees of
freedom, since @xmath symmetric systems have opened new branches in the
search for solitonic solutions for the KdV equation and other integrable
models [ Correa and Fring ( 2016 ); Mateos Guilarte and Plyushchay (
2019 ); Cen et al. ( 2020 ) ] .

In the next chapter we continue with rationally extended AFF models
characterized by integer coupling constants as well as extended QHO
systems, but now from the perspective of supersymmetric quantum
mechanics.

## Chapter 6 Nonlinear supersymmetries in rationally extended systems

We now turn to the study of the extensions and deformations of the
superconformal and super-Schrödinger symmetries that appear in the
@xmath super-extended systems described by the superpartners ( @xmath ,
@xmath ) and ( @xmath , @xmath ). Here @xmath and @xmath correspond to
rational deformations of the QHO system and the AFF model with integer
values of the parameter @xmath , @xmath , respectively. As we have seen
in the last chapter, the rational deformations of the QHO system and the
AFF model are characterized, in the general case, by a finite number of
missing energy levels, or gaps, in their spectra, and the description of
such systems requires more than a couple of spectrum-generating
operators. It is because of this expansion of the sets of ladder
operators, whose differential order exceeds two, that nonlinearly
deformed superconformal and super-Schrödinger structures appear. This
chapter, based on the article [ Inzunza and Plyushchay ( 2019a ) ] , is
devoted to the description of the complete sets of generators of the
indicated symmetries. At this point, we will again take advantage of the
Darboux duality property of the QHO system.

### 6.1 Basic intertwining operators

According to [ Cariñena and Plyushchay ( 2017 ); Cariñena et al. ( 2018
) ] , with each of the dual schemes it is necessary first to associate
two basic pairs of the intertwining operators. Here, we discuss general
properties of such operators without taking care of the concrete nature
of the system built by the DCKA transformation. On the way, however,
some important distinctions between rational deformations of the AFF
model and harmonic oscillator have to be taken into account, and for
this reason, it is convenient to speak of two classes of the systems. We
distinguish between them by introducing the class index @xmath , where
@xmath and @xmath will correspond to deformed harmonic oscillator and
deformed AFF conformal mechanics model, respectively.

As already established in the previous chapter, we will denote the
Hamiltonian produced by the positive scheme @xmath (negative scheme
@xmath ) by @xmath ( @xmath ), and the corresponding intertwining
operators by @xmath and @xmath ( @xmath and @xmath ), see Sec. ( 5.1 ).
These operators satisfy the relations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.1)
     @xmath      (6.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and the corresponding Hermitian conjugate relations for @xmath and
@xmath . Here @xmath could be @xmath or @xmath , depending on the class
index @xmath of the rationally deformed system @xmath that we want to
study. Applying operator identities ( 6.1.2 ) to an arbitrary physical
or nonphysical (formal) eigenstate @xmath of @xmath different from any
seed state of the positive scheme and using Eq. ( 5.1.4 ), one can
derive the equality

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

to be valid modulo a multiplicative constant. As a result, both
operators acting on the same state of the harmonic oscillator produce
different states of the new system. We have seen this behavior before in
last chapter, Sec. 5.3 . The Hermitian conjugate operators @xmath and
@xmath do a similar job but in the opposite direction. Eq. ( 6.1.3 )
suggests that some peculiarities should be taken into account for class
2 systems : the infinite potential barrier at @xmath assumes that
physical states of @xmath and @xmath systems are described by odd wave
functions. Then, in order for @xmath to transform physical states of
@xmath into physical states of @xmath , we must take @xmath to be odd
for odd @xmath in ( 6.1.3 ). This means that @xmath transforms physical
states into physical only if @xmath is even. In the case of odd @xmath ,
it is necessary to take @xmath or @xmath as a physical intertwining
operator. It is convenient to take into account this peculiarity by
denoting the remainder of the division @xmath by @xmath : it takes value
@xmath in the class @xmath of the systems with odd @xmath and equals
zero in all other cases.

The products of the described intertwining operators are of the form (
1.2.7 ), and for further analysis it is useful to write down them
explicitly:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.4)
     @xmath      (6.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Here @xmath are indexes of physical states with eigenvalues @xmath in
the set @xmath , and @xmath correspond to nonphysical states with
eigenvalues @xmath in the negative scheme @xmath . In the same vein, it
is useful to write

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.6)
     @xmath      (6.1.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We also have the operator identities

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.1.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and their Hermitian conjugate versions, where @xmath and @xmath are
polynomials whose explicit structure is given in Appendix C.1 . In
one-gap deformations of the harmonic oscillator and gapless deformations
of @xmath these polynomials reduce to @xmath .

### 6.2 Extended sets of ladder and intertwining operators

Actually, instead of three types of ladder operators, we have a total of
three families of operators

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.1)
     @xmath      (6.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where, formally, @xmath can take any nonnegative integer value and
@xmath is such that @xmath , otherwise operators ( 6.2.2 ) reduce to
@xmath , [ Inzunza and Plyushchay ( 2019a ) ] . Due to relations ( 6.1.4
)-( 6.1.8 ) one concludes that at @xmath and @xmath all these operators
are reduced to certain polynomials in @xmath . These objects are
generated by taking the commutator relations between two arbitrary
representatives of the spectrum generator set described in the previous
chapter, and behave like powers of the ladder operator in the QHO
system. Calculations with these operators are discussed in detail in
Appendix C.2 , so this chapter contains only the main results.

Independently of the class of the system, or on whether the operators
are physical or not, the three families @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
satisfy the commutation relations of the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a certain polynomial of the corresponding Hamiltonian
operator of the system, whose order of polynomial is equal to
differential order of @xmath minus one, see Appendix C.2 . Algebra (
6.2.3 ) can be considered as a deformation of @xmath , [ Mateos Guilarte
and Plyushchay ( 2019 ) ] . Of all the operators that can be built, our
objective is to discriminate against those that are physical and cannot
be written as products of lower order elements, belonging to others or
to the same family. Having this in mind, we have the following assertion
related to the three families:

-   From ( 6.2.3 ) one concludes that @xmath . Then, for @xmath and
    @xmath families, the physical operators are those whose index is
    @xmath with @xmath , while for @xmath family index should be @xmath
    , where @xmath is integer such that @xmath .

-   For isospectral deformations of the AFF model, the
    spectrum-generating set is given by any pair of the conjugate
    operators @xmath , @xmath , or @xmath .

-   Due to Eq. ( 6.1.8 ) one realizes that the basic operators in the
    general case are

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (6.2.4)
      -- -------- -- ---------

-   For one-gap deformations of the harmonic oscillator, the set of
    basic ladder operators can be reduced further to the set

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (6.2.5)
      -- -------- -- ---------

    where the relations @xmath and @xmath were taken into account.

As is obvious from their explicit form, any of the basic elements
belonging to one of the three families of ladder operators can be
constructed by “gluing” two different intertwining operators associated
with an alternative DCKA transformation, which are of the form @xmath
and @xmath , so their number should also be reduced. Indeed, for general
deformations only the operators

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and their Hermitian conjugate counterparts can be considered as basic,
see Appendix C.2 . One can note that the total number of the basic
intertwining operators @xmath is greater than the number of the basic
ladder operators @xmath which can be constructed with their help. In
particular case of gapless deformations of the AFF model, the indicated
set of Darboux generators can be reduced to those which produce, by
‘gluing’ procedure, one conjugate pair of the spectrum-generating ladder
operators of the form @xmath .

For @xmath one-gap systems, identity ( 6.1.8 ) allows us to reduce
further the set of the basic intertwining operators, which, together
with corresponding Hermitian conjugate ones, is given by any of the two
options,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

see Appendix C.2 . Here we have reserved @xmath and @xmath values for
index @xmath to the dual schemes intertwining operators: in the first
choice, @xmath and @xmath , and for the second choice we have @xmath and
@xmath . Written in this way, these operators satisfy the intertwining
relations @xmath or @xmath , and their Hermitian conjugate versions.
Then, to study supersymmetry, we have to choose either positive or
negative scheme to define the @xmath super-extended Hamiltonian. We take
@xmath if we work with a negative scheme, and @xmath if positive scheme
is chosen for the construction of super-extension.

### 6.3 Supersymmetric extensions

For each of the two dual schemes, one can construct an @xmath
super-extended Hamiltonian operator following the recipe given in Chap.
1 , equation ( 1.2.8 ). The task is to choose appropriately @xmath and
@xmath . We put @xmath and @xmath for positive scheme, and choose @xmath
and @xmath for negative scheme. For both options, we set @xmath if we
are dealing with a rational extension of harmonic oscillator, and @xmath
if we work with a deformation of the AFF model. We name the matrix
Hamiltonian associated with negative scheme as @xmath , and denote by
@xmath the Hamiltonian of positive scheme. The spectrum of these systems
can be found using the properties of the corresponding intertwining
operators described in Sec. 1.2.2 , see also refs. [ Cariñena and
Plyushchay ( 2017 ); Cariñena et al. ( 2018 ) ] . The two Hamiltonians
are connected by relation @xmath , and @xmath plays a role of the @xmath
symmetry generator for both super-extended systems. In this subsection
we finally construct the corresponding spectrum-generating superalgebra
for @xmath and @xmath . The resulting structures are based on the
physical operators @xmath . As we shall see, the supersymmetric versions
of the @xmath systems are described by a nonlinearly extended
super-Schrödinger symmetry with bosonic generators to be differential
operators of even and odd orders, while in the case of the @xmath
systems we obtain nonlinearly extended superconformal symmetry in which
bosonic generators are of even order only.

We construct a pair of fermionic operators on the basis of each
intertwining operator from the set ( 6.2.6 ) and their Hermitian
conjugate counterparts. Let us consider first the extended nonlinear
super-Schrödinger symmetry of a one-gap deformed harmonic oscillator,
and then we generalize the picture. If we choose the negative scheme,
then we use @xmath defined in ( 6.2.7 ) to construct the set of
operators

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

They satisfy the (anti)-commutation relations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath and @xmath are some polynomials whose structure is
described in Appendix C.3 . For the choice of the positive scheme to fix
extended Hamiltonian, according to ( 6.2.7 ), the corresponding
fermionic operators are given by @xmath . They satisfy relations of the
same form ( 6.3.2 ) but with replacement @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath . The fermionic operators @xmath (or @xmath ) are the
supercharges of the (nonlinear in general case) @xmath Poincaré
supersymmetry, which are integrals of motion of the system @xmath (or
@xmath ), and @xmath (or @xmath ) with polynomials @xmath defined in (
6.1.5 ). The operators @xmath are analogous here to supercharges in
@xmath in the linear case, see Chap. 2 . On the other hand, we have here
the fermionic operators @xmath as analogs of dynamical integrals @xmath
there. We recall that in the simple linear case considered in section
2.2 , the interchange between positive and negative schemes corresponds
to the automorphism of superconformal algebra, and this observation will
be helpful for us for the analysis of the nonlinearly extended
super-Schrödinger structures. Here, actually, each of the @xmath pairs
of fermionic operators distinct from supercharges provides a possible
dynamical extension of the super-Poincaré symmetry. As we will see, all
of them are necessary to obtain a closed nonlinear spectrum-generating
superalgebra of the super-extended system.

To construct any extension of the deformed Poincaré supersymmetry, we
calculate @xmath , in the negative scheme, or @xmath in the positive
one. In the first case we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath , @xmath for @xmath , and @xmath are given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Following definition ( 6.2.7 ), one finds directly that @xmath is equal
to @xmath when @xmath , while for @xmath , this operator is equal to
@xmath , and takes the form of @xmath for @xmath . The operators @xmath
reduce to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Note that @xmath and @xmath with @xmath are two different matrix
extensions of the same operator @xmath .

For a super-extended system based on the positive scheme, we obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where, again, @xmath , and @xmath are given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Now, @xmath when @xmath , while for positive index @xmath this operator
reduces to @xmath when @xmath and to @xmath when @xmath . For the other
matrix element we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Here, again, there are two different matrix extensions of the operators
of the @xmath -family given by @xmath and @xmath when @xmath .

By comparing both schemes one can note two other special features. It
turns out that @xmath when @xmath , and this corresponds to the
automorphism discussed in section 2.2 . In the same way, for @xmath ,
operators @xmath and @xmath are different matrix extensions of @xmath .

From here and in what follows we do not specify whether we have the
super-extended system corresponding to the negative or the positive
scheme, and will just use, respectively, the unprimed or primed
notations for operators of the alternative dual schemes. In particular,
we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.3.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

that shows explicitly that our new bosonic operators have the nature of
ladder operators of the super-extended system @xmath . Commutators
@xmath and @xmath produce polynomials in @xmath and @xmath , which can
be calculated by using the polynomials @xmath defined in ( 6.2.3 ). The
algebra generated by @xmath , @xmath and @xmath is identified as a
deformation of @xmath , where a concrete form of deformation depends on
the system, @xmath , and on @xmath . Each of these nonlinear bosonic
algebras expands further up to a certain closed nonlinear deformation of
superconformal @xmath algebra generated by the subset of operators

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

see Appendix C.3 .

The deficiency of any of these nonlinear superalgebras is that none of
them is a spectrum-generating algebra for the super-extended system :
application of operators from the set ( 6.3.10 ) and of their products
does not allow one to connect two arbitrary eigenstates in the spectrum
of @xmath . To find the spectrum-generating superalgebra for this kind
of the super-extended systems, one can try to include into the
superalgebra simultaneously the operators @xmath and, say, @xmath or
@xmath . The operators @xmath provide us with matrix extension of the
operators @xmath being ladder operators for deformed subsystems @xmath
or @xmath . Analogously, operators @xmath or @xmath supply us with
matrix extensions of the ladder operators @xmath or @xmath ( @xmath or
@xmath ) when systems @xmath are of the class @xmath or @xmath with even
(odd) @xmath . Therefore, it is enough to unify the sets of generators
@xmath and @xmath . Having in mind the commutation relations between
operators of the three families @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , one can
find, however, that the commutators of the operators @xmath with @xmath
generate other bosonic matrix operators @xmath . The commutation of
these operators with supercharges @xmath generates the rest of the
fermionic operators we considered, see Appendix C.3 for details. The set
of higher order generators is completed by considering all non-reducible
bosonic and fermionic generators, which do not decompose into the
products of other generators. In correspondence with that was noted
above, we arrive finally at two different extensions of the sets of
operators with index less than @xmath . By this reason it is convenient
also to introduce the operators

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which help us to fix in a unique way the bosonic set of generators. For
our purposes we choose to write all the operators @xmath in terms of
@xmath and @xmath when @xmath in the negative scheme, and when @xmath in
the extended system associated with the positive scheme. For indexes
outside the indicated scheme-dependent range, we neglect operators
@xmath because they are not basic in correspondence with the discussion
on reduction of ladder operators in the previous Sec. 6.2 . As a result,
we have to drop from ( 6.3.10 ) all the operators @xmath with @xmath .

By taking anti-commutators of fermionic operators @xmath with @xmath ,
@xmath , we produce bosonic dynamical integrals @xmath , which have
exactly the same structure of the even generators @xmath in the
extension associated with the dual scheme. In this way we obtain the
subsets of operators

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.3.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which also generate closed nonlinear super-algerabraic structures. With
the help of ( 6.3.11 ), we find similarly to the subsets ( 6.3.10 ),
that a part of the sets ( 6.3.12 ) also can be reduced.

Having in mind the ordering relation between @xmath and @xmath , the
super-extended systems associated with the negative schemes can be
characterized finally by the following irreducible, in the sense of
subection 6.2 , subsets of symmetry generators :

For more details, see Appendix C.2 . A similar result can be obtained
for super-extended systems associated with positive schemes, where the
roles played by families @xmath and @xmath , and of numbers @xmath and
@xmath are interchanged.

Finally, we arrive at the following picture. Any operator that can be
generated via (anti)-commutation relations and which does not belong to
the sub-sets appearing in Table 6.1 , can be written as a product of the
basic generators. For super-extensions of rationally deformed one-gap
harmonic oscillator systems we have considered, the spectrum-generating
algebra is composed from the sets @xmath and @xmath and from those
operators generated by them via (anti)-commutation relations which
cannot be written as a product of the basic generators. It is worth to
stress that in this set of generators the unique true integrals of
motion, in addition to @xmath and @xmath , are the supercharges @xmath ,
while the rest has to be promoted to the dynamical integrals by unitary
transforming them with the evolution operator.

For gapless rational extensions of the systems of class @xmath , only
the subset @xmath has to be considered instead of the family of sets
@xmath . For super-extensions of rationally deformed systems of
arbitrary form in the sense of the class @xmath and arbitrary number of
gaps and their dimensions, the identification of their generalized
super-Schrödinger or superconformal structures is realized in a similar
way. The procedure is based on the sets of operators ( 6.2.4 ) and (
6.2.6 ), which include the operators ( 6.2.5 ) and ( 6.2.7 ) of the
discussed one-gap case as subsets. As a result, for every irreducible
pair of ladder operators ( 6.2.4 ) with index less than @xmath we have
two super-extensions which are related by operators of the form ( 6.3.11
). When we put together the subsets containing the spectrum-generating
set of operators, we obtain all the other structures.

We would like to end this section highlighting some of the peculiarities
of the simplest systems that can be treated with this machinery and
these are

Peculiarities of one-gap deformations of the QHO : The super-extended
Hamiltonian constructed on the base of the negative scheme with @xmath
is characterized by unbroken @xmath Poincaré supersymmetry, whose
supercharges, being the first order differential operators, generate a
Lie superalgebra. The @xmath family of ladder operators in the sense of
( 6.2.5 ) does not play any role in this scheme. On the other hand, the
super-Hamiltonian provided by the positive scheme possesses @xmath
singlet states while the ground state is a doublet. The @xmath
super-Poincaré algebra of such a system is nonlinear as its supercharges
are of differential order @xmath .

Peculiarities of gapless deformations of @xmath : The negative scheme
produces a super-Hamiltonian with spontaneously broken supersymmetry,
whose all energy levels are doubly degenerate; its @xmath super-Poincaré
algebra has linear nature. To construct the spectrum-generating algebra
we only need a matrix extension of the operators @xmath . In a
super-extended system produced by the positive scheme, @xmath physical
and nonphysical states of @xmath of positive energy (the latter being
even eigenstates of harmonic oscillator) are used as seed states for
DCKA transformation. Its supersymmetry is spontaneously broken, and the
@xmath super-Poincaré algebra is nonlinear. The nonlinearly deformed
super-Poincaré symmetry cannot be expanded to spectrum-generating
superalgebra by combining it with matrix extension of the @xmath , but
this can be done by using matrix extensions of the @xmath or @xmath
ladder operators, see ( 6.3.7 ). The resulting spectrum-generating
superalgebra is a certain nonlinear deformation of the @xmath
superconformal symmetry.

### 6.4 Example 1: Gapless deformation of AFF model

The example considered here corresponds to the same system analyzed in
the previous chapter, in Sec. 5.2 . By construction, the
super-Hamiltonian and its spectrum correspond to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.4.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath , with @xmath given in ( 5.2.1 ), and @xmath . Due to
complete isospectrality of @xmath and @xmath , all the energy levels of
the system ( 6.4.1 ) including the lowest one @xmath are doubly
degenerate and we have here the case of spontaneously broken @xmath
super-Poincaré symmetry generated by Hamiltonian @xmath , the
supercharges @xmath constructed in terms of @xmath , and by @xmath .

The generators that should be considered for the super-extension
correspond to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.4.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.4.3)
     @xmath      (6.4.4)
     @xmath      (6.4.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and the explisit form of @xmath is given in ( 5.2.3 ). The complete set
of superalgebraic relations they satisfy is

  -- -------- -- ----------
                 (6.4.6)
     @xmath      (6.4.7)
     @xmath      (6.4.8)
     @xmath      (6.4.9)
     @xmath      (6.4.10)
     @xmath      (6.4.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath . The common eigenstates of @xmath and @xmath are

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath , and we have here the relations @xmath and @xmath . As a
result one can generate all the complete set of eigenstates of the
system by applying the generators of superalgebra to any of the two
ground states @xmath or @xmath , and therefore the restricted set of
generators we have chosen is the complete spectrum-generating set for
the super-extended system ( 6.4.1 ).

The complete set of (anti)-commutation relations ( 6.4.8 )-( 6.4.11 )
corresponds to a nonlinear deformation of superconformal algebra @xmath
. The first relation from ( 6.4.8 ) and equation ( 6.4.9 ) represent a
nonlinear deformation of @xmath with commutator @xmath to be a cubic
polynomial in @xmath . From the superalgebraic relations it follows that
like in the linear case of superconformal @xmath symmetry discussed in
Chap 2 , Sec. 2.2 , here the extension of the set of generators @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath of the @xmath Poincaré super-symmetry by any one of
the dynamical integrals @xmath , @xmath , @xmath or @xmath recovers all
the complete set of generators of the nonlinearly deformed
superconformal @xmath symmetry.

Due to a gapless deformation of the AFF model, here similarly to the
case of the non-deformed superconformal @xmath symmetry, the
super-extension based on the positive scheme is characterized by
essentially different physical properties. The positive scheme of the
system corresponds to the states @xmath and in this case we identify
@xmath as the extended Hamiltonian. This @xmath is related to @xmath
defined by Eq. ( 6.4.1 ) by the equality @xmath . For extended system
@xmath , supercharges @xmath have the form similar to @xmath in ( 6.4.3
) but with @xmath changed for the third order intertwining operators
@xmath , constructed with the formula ( 1.2.5 ). Being differential
operators of the third order, they satisfy relations @xmath and @xmath
with @xmath . The linear @xmath super-Poincaré algebra of the system (
6.4.1 ) is changed here for the nonlinearly deformed superalgebra with
anti-commutator to be polynomial of the third order in Hamiltonian. This
system has two nondegenerate states @xmath and @xmath of energies,
respectively, @xmath and @xmath , and both them are annihilated by both
supercharges @xmath . All higher energy levels @xmath with @xmath are
doubly degenerate. Thus, the nonlinearly deformed @xmath super-Poincaré
symmetry of this system can be identified as partially unbroken [
Klishevich and Plyushchay ( 2001 ) ] since the supercharges have
differential order three but annihilate only two nondegenerate physical
states. Here instead of the spectrum-generating set @xmath , formed by
true and dynamical integrals, the same role is played by the set of
integrals @xmath , where fermionic generators are @xmath with @xmath
according with ( 6.2.7 ) and ( 6.3.1 ). Bosonic dynamical integrals
@xmath are given here by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.4.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where equations in ( 6.3.7 ) have been used for the case of the present
positive scheme. They are generated via anticommutation of @xmath with
@xmath . The set of operators @xmath generates the nonlinearly deformed
superconformal @xmath symmetry given by superalgebra of the form ( 6.4.6
)–( 6.4.11 ), but with coefficients to be polynomials of higher order in
Hamiltonian @xmath in comparison with the case of the system ( 6.4.1 ).

### 6.5 Example 2: Rationally extended harmonic oscillator

The example we discuss in this subsection corresponds to the rational
extension of QHO based on the dual schemes @xmath , for which @xmath .
Different aspects of this system were extensively studied in literature
[ Cariñena and Plyushchay ( 2017 ); Cariñena et al. ( 2018 ) ] . Here,
we investigate it in the light of the nonlinearly extended
super-Schrödingerr symmetry.

The Hamiltonian produced via Darboux transformation based on the
negative scheme is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.5.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

whose spectrum is @xmath , @xmath , @xmath . In this system a gap of
size 6 separates the ground state energy from the equidistant part of
the spectrum, where levels are separated from each other by a distance
@xmath . The pair of ladder operators of the @xmath -family connects
here the isolated ground state with the equidistant part of the
spectrum, and together with the ladder operators @xmath they form the
complete spectrum-generating set of operators for the system. The
intertwining operators of the negative scheme are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.5.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We also have the intertwining operators @xmath constructed on the base
of the seed states of the positive scheme @xmath . These four operators
satisfy their respective intertwining relations of the form ( 6.1.2 ),
and their alternate products ( 6.1.5 ) reduce here to polynomials @xmath
, @xmath and @xmath , @xmath , where @xmath is the Hamiltonian operator
of the harmonic oscillator, and @xmath is the Hamiltonian produced by
positive scheme, which is related with @xmath , according to ( 5.1.4 ),
by @xmath . Here, the eigenstate @xmath is the isolated ground state of
zero energy of the shifted Hamiltonian operator @xmath .

The super-extended Hamiltonian and its spectrum are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.5.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The ground state of zero energy is non-degenerate and corresponds to the
ground state @xmath . Other energy levels are doubly degenerate and
correspond to eigenstates of the extended Hamiltonian ( 6.5.3 ) and
supercharge @xmath , see below :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.5.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The system ( 6.5.3 ) is characterized by unbroken @xmath Poincaré
supersymmetry. Now we use the construction of Sec. 6.3 to produce
generators of the extended nonlinearly deformed super-Schrödinger
symmetry of the system. Following ( 6.3.1 ) and ( 6.3.4 ), we construct
the odd operators @xmath with @xmath , and matrix bosonic ladder
operators @xmath with @xmath . Also we must consider the operators
@xmath with @xmath defined in ( 6.3.11 ). To obtain all the ingredients,
we have to use the version of relation ( C.2.5 ) for this system
translated to the supersymmetric extension of @xmath which is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.5.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Then we generate the even part of the superalgebra :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.5.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.5.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.5.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (6.5.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where we put @xmath and @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are some
polynomials in @xmath and @xmath , some of which are numerical
coefficients, whose explicit form is listed in Appendix C.4 . We note
that in Eqs. ( 6.5.7 ) and ( 6.5.8 ), the operators @xmath with @xmath
can appear, where for @xmath we use relation ( 6.5.5 ) (admitting @xmath
as coefficients in the algebra). Additionally we note that the operators
@xmath with @xmath in both equations where they appear are absorbed in
generators @xmath .

For eigenstates we have the relations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.5.10)
     @xmath      (6.5.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Eq. ( 6.5.10 ) shows that we can connect the isolated ground state with
the equidistant part of the spectrum using @xmath , which are not
spectrum-generating operators. Eq. ( 6.5.11 ) indicates that the states
in the equidistant part of the spectrum can be connected by @xmath , but
this part of the spectrum cannot be connected by them with the ground
state. Thus we have to use a combination of both pairs of these
operators. On the other hand, the odd operators @xmath satisfy relations
( 6.3.2 ), where @xmath , and, therefore, we have again the linear
@xmath Poincaré supersymmetry as a sub-superalgebra generated by @xmath
, @xmath and @xmath . The general anti-commutation structure is given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.5.12)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath in general are some linear combinations of the indicated
ladder operators with coefficients to be polynomials in @xmath , @xmath
and @xmath . Some of these relations define ladder operators, see Eq. (
6.3.3 ). For @xmath and @xmath we can use ( 6.3.7 ) knowing that @xmath
, see Sec. 6.3 . For structure of anti-commutation relations with other
combinations of indexes, see Appendix C.4 . To complete the description
of the generated nonlinear supersymmetric structure, we write down the
commutators between the independent lowering operators and
supercharges :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.5.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.5.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Here @xmath and @xmath with @xmath are polynomials in @xmath or
numerical coefficients, some of which are listed in the sets of general
commutation relations in Appendix C.3 , while other are given explicitly
in Appendix C.4 . As the odd fermionic operators are Hermitian, then
@xmath , and we do not write them explicitly. In matrix language, Eq. (
6.5.13 ) can be written as

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (6.5.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and an important point here is that the number @xmath could take values
less than -2 and @xmath could be greater than 5, but fermionic operators
are defined with the index @xmath taking integer values in the interval
@xmath . It is necessary to remember that we cut the series of @xmath
because operators outside the defined interval are reduced to
combinations (products) of other basic operators. In this way, we
formally apply the definition of @xmath outside of the indicated
interval and use the relation in Appendix C.2 to show that these “new”
generated operators reduce to combinations of operators with index
values in the interval @xmath and of the generators @xmath .

Finally, the subsets which produce closed sub-superalgebras here are
those defined by @xmath in ( 6.3.10 ), with @xmath in addition to @xmath
given in ( 6.3.12 ) with @xmath .

With respect to the positive scheme, the super-Hamiltonian is given by
@xmath . It has two positive energy singlet states of the form @xmath
with @xmath ; besides, there are two ground states @xmath and @xmath of
energy @xmath . According to the construction from the previous section,
the fermionic operators here are @xmath , and the basic subsets which
generate closed sub-superalgebras are @xmath and @xmath with @xmath and
@xmath .

One can note that considering @xmath as coefficients, the subset @xmath
also generates a closed nonlinear superalgebraic structure.

### 6.6 Remarks

In fact, the construction in Sec. 6.3 offers more possibilities: in
principle, the choice of the constant @xmath in the Hamiltonian ( 1.2.8
) can be modified in such a way that another pair of fermionic operators
in the scheme ( 6.3.1 ) will be the true integrals of the motion. As a
result, the super-extended system will have a different spectrum. We
schematically discussed this picture in the original work [ Inzunza and
Plyushchay ( 2019a ) ] . Another possibility is to choose @xmath and
@xmath and, as a consequence, the intertwining operators will be the
ladder operators in ( 6.2.4 ), and one can expect that the use of
intermediate systems in the DCKA procedure will provide lower order
intertwining operators, however this is still an open problem.

Finally, the discussion in these last two chapters involved AFF models
with integer coupling constant @xmath , so the next natural step is to
try to generalize for the case @xmath with @xmath real equal to or
greater than @xmath . This is the objective of the next chapter.

## Chapter 7 The Klein four-group and Darboux duality

The invariance of the QHO eigenvalue problem to the discrete
transformation @xmath was the basis of the construction presented in the
last two chapters. The presence of nonphysical eigenstates gives rise to
the so-called Darboux duality, which was the key to building the
spectrum-generating ladder operators for extended rational systems. In
this chapter we demonstrate that the Schrödinger equation for the AFF
model with @xmath has an even larger discrete symmetry group, which will
be responsible for the generalization of Darboux duality for these
systems. Such a discrete group has its particular consequences when it
acts on eigenstates and (super) symmetry generators.

With the generalization of the Darboux duality at hand, constructing
spectrum-generating ladder operators for rational deformations of the
general AFF models, as well as their nonlinear algebras, is
straightforward. It is interesting to recall that when @xmath is a
half-integer number, the Jordan states associated with confluent Darboux
transformations naturally enter in the framework. In particular, some
deformed systems undergo structural changes when we set @xmath with
@xmath . The results contained in this chapter were reported in our work
[ Inzunza and Plyushchay ( 2019b ) ] .

### 7.1 The Klein four-group in AFF model

Parameterizing the coupling constant in parabolic form @xmath , which is
symmetric with respect to @xmath , we artificially induce the invariance
of the equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with respect to the transformation @xmath . Equation ( 7.1.1 ) is also
invariant with respect to the transformation @xmath . These two
transformations generate the Klein four-group as a symmetry of equation
( 7.1.1 ): @xmath , where each element is its own inverse. At the level
of the stationary Schrödinger equation, the action of @xmath reduces to
the transformation @xmath , which means that @xmath is a completely
broken @xmath symmetry, for which the transformed eigenstates @xmath
with eigenvalues @xmath are nonphysical solutions. The transformation
@xmath at the same level of the stationary Schrödinger equation implies
that the energy eigenvalues change as @xmath . The difference between
the original energy level and the transformed one is @xmath , where
@xmath is the distance between two consecutive levels. So, if we take
@xmath with @xmath , we obtain @xmath , and find that physical energy
levels with @xmath are transformed into physical energy levels but
lowered by @xmath . Under the action of @xmath , the eigenstates in (
4.1.3 ) are transformed into the functions

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In the case of @xmath , functions ( 7.1.2 ) do not satisfy boundary
condition at @xmath because of the presence of the factor @xmath , and
they are nonphysical, formal eigenstates of @xmath . The case of @xmath
requires, however, a separate consideration. To analyze this case, we
observe that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Due to the poles of Gamma function, this expression vanishes when @xmath
, i.e., @xmath annihilates the first @xmath eigenstates of the system.
On the other hand, the identity

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with integer @xmath and @xmath , which follows from ( 2.1.27 ), allows
us to write @xmath when @xmath , and this is coherent with the change of
the energy eigenvalues under application to them of transformation
@xmath . In conclusion, @xmath corresponds to a symmetry which is just
the identity operator when @xmath , while for @xmath this symmetry
annihilates the @xmath lowest physical eigenstates, but restores them by
acting on the higher eigenstates ¹ ¹ 1 This is similar to a picture of a
Hilbert’s hotel under departure of clients from first @xmath rooms with
numbers @xmath with simultaneous translation of the clients from rooms
with numbers @xmath , into the rooms with numbers @xmath . Note that the
power @xmath of lowering generator of conformal symmetry with @xmath
acts on physical eigenstates in a way similar to @xmath , but violating
normalization of the states. . From this point of view, in the case of
half-integer @xmath , transformation @xmath does not produce anything
new. Nevertheless, we can also construct a finite set of nonphysical
solutions of the same nonphysical nature as in ( 7.1.2 ) given by the
functions

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

singular at @xmath , whose corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath .

We note that the combined transformation @xmath always produces
nonphysical solutions for all values of @xmath due to the presence of
@xmath . Wave eigenfunctions transformed by the @xmath generators @xmath
and @xmath diverge exponentially at infinity, and for the following
consideration it is convenient to introduce a special common notation
for them: @xmath , with @xmath for functions that vanish at infinity and
@xmath for functions that diverge when @xmath . In the case of @xmath ,
@xmath , we have @xmath for @xmath , and one finds that ( 7.1.5 ) and
their partners in the sense of Eq. ( 1.1.7 ) are related with
nonphysical eigenstates produced by @xmath and their partners,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Now, let us study the quantum conformal symmetry of the AFF model from
the perspective of the discrete Klein four-group. Keep in mind that
under these transformations, @xmath ladder operators @xmath introduced
in ( 4.1.6 ) change as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

so what we have here is a group of automorphisms of the conformal
algebra. Knowing that @xmath annihilates the ground state, we can use
the @xmath group to obtain the kernels of @xmath in the case @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

For @xmath , the kernels of @xmath are similar to ( 7.1.8 ) but with the
states @xmath and @xmath are replaced, respectively, by the Jordan
states

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.1.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath and @xmath are constants.

In the context of the Darboux transformations, the equations in ( 7.1.8
) indicate that the second order differential operators @xmath are
generated by the choice of the seed states @xmath , and by means of Eq.
( 1.2.4 ) we can write the equalities

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.1.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath with @xmath , @xmath , corresponds to an eigenstate or a
Jordan state of @xmath . The Wronskian form of these equalities is
useful to find the action of the ladder operators on the states @xmath
and @xmath . Using some Wronskian identities from the Appendix A ,
specifically the Eqs. ( A.1.2 ) and ( A.1.4 ), as wells as the relations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.1.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

one can find that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.1.12)
     @xmath      (7.1.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

So far, we realize that the states of Jordan should play some role in
the case of half-integer @xmath , however, let us first consider the
general case. For this, we use ( 1.3.5 ) and the @xmath algebra to prove
the relations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.1.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Thus, the ladder operators act in a similar way as they act on
eigenstates of @xmath , but with a difference when @xmath . When @xmath
, we obtain the relations @xmath and @xmath . Due to ( 7.1.6 ) one can
make the identification @xmath , so in the half-integer case @xmath with
@xmath we obtain

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.1.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Acting on these relations by @xmath , we obtain zero, and conclude that

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.1.16)
  -- -------- -- ----------

for @xmath . The whole picture is summarized in Figure 7.1 .

### 7.2 Superconformal symmetry and the Klein four-group

Here, we inspect the action of the Klein four-group on a supersymmetric
extension of the AFF model. To do so, we must pay attention to the
intertwining operators @xmath and @xmath introduced in Chap. 2 , Eqs. (
2.2.1 ) and ( 2.2.6 ) (with @xmath ). Acting on them, the group produces

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.2.1)
     @xmath      (7.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

These relations are valid for @xmath , while for @xmath the
transformation @xmath reduces to the identity.

The symmetry generators of the super-extended AFF model, namely @xmath ,
were defined in Eqs. ( 2.2.4 ), ( 2.2.10 ), ( 2.2.11 ) and ( 2.2.15 ).
The basic blocks to construct these objects are the intertwining
operators @xmath and @xmath , so the role of the Klein four-group at the
supersymmetric level is at hand. Nevertheless, before to apply the
relations ( 7.2.1 )-( 7.2.2 ) in the supersymmetric generators, it is
convenient to remember that the corresponding superalgebra ( 2.2.16 )-(
2.2.22 ) has the automorphism @xmath , which corresponds to the
transformations @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath
@xmath . Then, the action of @xmath gives us

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.2.3)
     @xmath      (7.2.4)
     @xmath      (7.2.5)
     @xmath      (7.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which in fact is a combination of the shift @xmath , the action of
@xmath and the unitary rotation. The transformed generators ( 7.2.3 )-(
7.2.6 ) still satisfy the same superconformal algebra, i.e. @xmath is an
automorphism of the @xmath symmetry, however the new generators describe
another super-extended system: Unlike the initial system @xmath , in the
transformed one the @xmath Poincaré supersymmetry is spontaneously
broken in the case of @xmath , see Chap. 2 . The only exception from
this rule corresponds to the case @xmath , where the transformed
Hamiltonian reduces to @xmath , and represents a unitarily transformed
super-Hamiltonian with the unbroken @xmath Poincaré supersymmetry.

On the other hand, one can verify that when @xmath acts on the
Hamiltonian @xmath , it produces @xmath , and this time the @xmath
Poincaré supersymmetry of the system is changed from the spontaneously
broken phase (in the case of @xmath to the phase of unbroken
supersymmetry, with the only exception of the system @xmath with
unbroken supersymmetry, which unitary transforms into @xmath . This
action of transformation @xmath on super-extended systems can be
compared with the case of the non-extended AFF system, where @xmath acts
identically on its Hamiltonian and generators of the conformal symmetry,
though, as we saw, it acts nontrivially on eigenstates of the system.

On the other hand, the action of @xmath produces

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.2.7)
     @xmath      (7.2.8)
     @xmath      (7.2.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Transformed Hamiltonian operator is similar here to the Hamiltonian
produced by the automorphism @xmath but multiplied by @xmath . This
correlates with the anti-Hermitian nature of the transformed fermion
generators of superalgebra. Accordingly, the spectrum of the transformed
matrix Hamiltonian is negative, not bounded from below, and each of its
level is doubly degenerate for @xmath .

In correspondence with the described picture, the application of the
combined transformation @xmath is just another automorphism of the
superconformal algebra ( 2.2.16 )-( 2.2.22 ), which produces
anti-Hermitian odd generators, and @xmath . The discrete spectrum of the
transformed Hamiltonian is not restricted from below and is given by the
numbers @xmath , @xmath , where each negative energy level is doubly
degenerate, while non-degenerate zero energy level corresponds to the
state @xmath .

### 7.3 Dual Darboux schemes

With the new set of nonphysical solutions, in this section we extend the
idea of dual schemes for the AFF model with @xmath . As we have shown in
Sec. 7.1 , the case in which @xmath takes half-integer values is
special, because the Jordan states take relevance through the properties
of the conformal symmetry generators ² ² 2 Operators @xmath can be
interpreted as the second order intertwining operators associated with
the seed states @xmath for @xmath , and to the confluent scheme @xmath ,
when @xmath . , which are simultaneously the ladder operators for
corresponding AFF systems, see equation ( 7.1.15 ). For this reason, we
start first with the case where @xmath is not a half-integer. Let us
choose a generic set of physical and nonphysical eigenstates of @xmath
as seed states,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath and @xmath , and, for simplicity, we suppose that @xmath
and @xmath . Let us assume that in the scheme ( 7.3.1 ) there are no
repeated states and both @xmath and @xmath carry the same sign for all
@xmath and @xmath . Also let us define the index number

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which can correspond to a state with index @xmath or @xmath . By means
of the algorithm described in Appendix B.2 one can show that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.3.3)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- ---------

is satisfied, where the marked states @xmath and @xmath , with @xmath
and @xmath , are omitted from the set @xmath . On the contrary, if
@xmath and @xmath carry the minus sign, we have the equality

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.3.4)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- ---------

where now @xmath and @xmath . These relations are also valid if one of
the numbers @xmath or @xmath is equal to zero, which means that in the
corresponding scheme there are only states of the same kind with respect
to the first index, @xmath or @xmath , respectively.

When considering @xmath with @xmath , some repeated states could appear
due to @xmath . This means that the Wronskian must vanish, however, that
happens because, in the general case, this object takes the form @xmath
, where @xmath disappears in these special cases (see the example (
7.3.7 ) below). To obtain a deformed AFF system with the potential
modified by @xmath for half-integer @xmath , as well as its dual scheme,
we will have relations analogous to ( 7.3.3 ) and ( 7.3.4 ), but
changing each state of the form @xmath by @xmath , which means that we
are dealing with the confluent Darboux transformation, see Appendix B.3
for a detailed derivation. The general rules of the Darboux duality can
be summarized and better understood with the examples presented
diagrammatically in Fig. 7.2 .

These types of diagrams are read in the same way as for the harmonic
oscillator mirror diagram presented in Chap. 5 and in this case they
correspond to the following Wronskian relations:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.3.5)
     @xmath      (7.3.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

whose explicit forms are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.3.7)
     @xmath      (7.3.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The transformation which relates the AFF systems described by @xmath
with @xmath can also be understood within this picture. Furthermore,
using a diagram similar to those in Fig. 7.2 , one can show that the
schemes @xmath and @xmath are dual.

### 7.4 Rationally deformed AFF systems

A rational deformation of the AFF model can be generated by taking a set
of the seed states

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.4.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

composed from @xmath pairs of neighbour physical states. Krein-Adler
theorem [ Krein ( 1957 ); Adler ( 1994 ) ] guarantees that the resulting
system described by the Hamiltonian operator of the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.4.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is nonsingular on @xmath . Here @xmath and @xmath are real-valued
polynomials, @xmath has no zeroes on @xmath , its degree is two more
than that of @xmath , and so, the last rational term in ( 7.4.2 )
vanishes at infinity. The spectrum of the system ( 7.4.2 ) is the
equidistant spectrum of the AFF model with the removed energy levels
corresponding to the seed states. Consequently, any gap in the resulting
system has a size @xmath , where @xmath correspond to @xmath adjacent
pairs in the set ( 7.4.1 ) which produce a given gap. An example of this
kind of systems is generated by the scheme @xmath , whose dual negative
scheme is given by equation ( 7.3.6 ).

Another class of rationally extended AFF systems is provided by
isospectral deformations generated by the schemes of the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.4.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which contains the states of the form @xmath . As the functions used in
this scheme are proportional to @xmath and do not have real zeros other
than @xmath , one obtains a regular on @xmath system of the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.4.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is a rational function disappearing at infinity [ Grandati
( 2012 ) ] , and one can find that potential of the system ( 7.4.4 ) is
a convex on @xmath function. In this case the transformation does not
remove or add energy levels, and, consequently, the initial system
@xmath and the deformed system ( 7.4.4 ) are completely isospectral
superpartners. Some concrete examples of the systems ( 7.4.4 ) with
integer values of @xmath were considered in the two previous chapters,
see also [ Cariñena et al. ( 2018 ) ] . Consider yet another generalized
Darboux scheme which allows us to interpolate between different
rationally deformed AFF systems. For this we assume that the initial AFF
system is characterized by the parameter @xmath , where @xmath and
@xmath can take any non-negative integer value. For these ranges of
values of the parameter @xmath , real zeros of the functions @xmath are
located between zeros of @xmath , so that we can rethink the Krein-Adler
theorem and consider the scheme

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.4.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which includes @xmath states and where we suppose that @xmath for all
@xmath . The DCKA transformation based on the set ( 7.4.5 ) produces the
system

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.4.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the constant @xmath is provided by the Gaussian factor in the
Wronskian, and the last term is a rational function vanishing at
infinity and having no zeros on the whole real line, including the
origin, if an only if @xmath , see Appendix A.2 . Let us analyze now
some special values of @xmath .

The case @xmath : by virtue of relations between Laguerre and Hermite
polynomials mentioned in Chap 2 , see equation ( 2.1.28 ), in this case
we obtain those systems which were generated in [ Cariñena et al. ( 2018
) ] and discussed in Chap. 5 , we refer to systems ( 5.1.2 ).

The case @xmath : we have here the relation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.4.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

due to which the scheme ( 7.4.5 ) transforms into

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.4.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which corresponds to ( 7.4.1 ) with @xmath . We additionally suppose
that @xmath , otherwise the Wronskian vanishes. Note that when @xmath ,
the image of the states @xmath under Darboux mapping ( 1.2.4 ) is a
physical state, but in the case @xmath such states are mapped into zero
since the argument @xmath appears twice in the Wronskian of the
numerator.

The case @xmath : this case was not included in the range of @xmath from
the beginning due to relation @xmath which would mean the appearance of
the repeated states in the scheme ( 7.4.5 ) and vanishing of the
corresponding Wronskian. However, in Appendix A.2 we show that the limit
relation @xmath is valid, where the scheme @xmath is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.4.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which corresponds to a non-singular confluent Darboux transformation, [
Correa et al. ( 2015 ) ] .

By considering this last comment, in conclusion we have that when @xmath
, the states @xmath (and @xmath in the case of @xmath ) are nonphysical
states. This means that only the physical states @xmath indicate the
energy levels removed under the corresponding Darboux transformation,
i.e., there are gaps of the minimum size @xmath , where @xmath is the
distance between energy levels of the AFF model, which can merge to
produce energy gaps of the size @xmath . On the other hand, when @xmath
, we have a typical Krein-Adler scheme with gaps of the size @xmath .

To give an example, we put @xmath , that means @xmath , and consider the
scheme @xmath given in ( 7.3.7 ) with @xmath , and in the case of @xmath
we have the scheme @xmath . The potential of the rationally deformed AFF
system generated by the corresponding Darboux transformation is shown in
Fig. 7.3 and Fig. 7.4 .

As it is seen from the figures, the first minimum of the potential grows
in its absolute value, its position moves to @xmath , and it disappears
at @xmath , while the local maximum near zero also grows, its position
approaches zero, and it goes to infinity in the limit. Besides, the
first maximum of the ground state vanishes when @xmath approximates the
limit value @xmath . Coherently with the described behavior of the
potential, the image of the Darboux-transformed state @xmath , which is
the first excited state of the new system when @xmath , vanishes when
@xmath , the corresponding energy level disappears from the spectrum at
@xmath , and the size of the gap increases from @xmath to @xmath .

The described three possible selection rules to choose the seed states
correspond to the negative scheme ( 7.4.3 ), which generates isospectral
deformations, the positive Krein-Adler scheme ( 7.4.1 ), and the
positive interpolating scheme ( 7.4.5 ). Then we can apply the Darboux
duality to obtain the corresponding dual schemes for them. The positive
and negative dual schemes will be used in the next subsection to
construct complete sets of the spectrum-generating ladder operators for
the rationally deformed conformal mechanics systems.

### 7.5 Intertwining and ladder operators

In this paragraph we proceed to construct the intertwining and ladder
operators of rational deformed system obtained by means of the seed
states selection rules detailed above. For simplicity we do not touch
here the schemes that contain Jordan states. However, we have relations
( 1.3.8 ) and ( 7.1.16 ), and relations ( 7.3.3 ) and ( 7.3.4 ) which
were extended to such cases with the corresponding substitutions. This
means that the properties summarized below are also valid for the
schemes containing Jordan states. Suppose that the positive (negative)
scheme possesses @xmath ( @xmath ) seed states. Then the generated
Hamiltonian @xmath satisfy the relation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.5.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the bigest quantum number in the positive scheme. Let us
denote by @xmath and @xmath the intertwining operators of the positive
and negative schemes being differential operators of the orders @xmath
and @xmath , respectively. They satisfy the intertwining relations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.5.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

As the states @xmath behave asymptotically as @xmath , the states
produced from them by application of differential operators @xmath will
carry the same exponential factor. Having this asymptotic behavior in
mind, let us suppose that @xmath and @xmath are some arbitrary states
from the negative and positive scheme, respectively. By using ( 7.5.2 ),
we obtain the relations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.5.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

in both sides of which the functions satisfy the same second order
differential equation and have the same behaviour at infinity. Note that
in the dual schemes in ( 7.3.3 ) and ( 7.3.4 ), the indexes @xmath and
@xmath are in correspondence with the indexes @xmath , and @xmath of the
states omitted from the positive and negative scheme, respectively. This
helps us to find that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.5.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

from where we obtain the identities

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.5.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Finally, to have a complete picture we write the relations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.5.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Note that in the case @xmath , first equation reduces to ( 6.1.3 ).

In the case of the dual schemes where @xmath , similar relations are
obtained but with @xmath and @xmath replaced by @xmath and @xmath when
is required.

With the help of the described intertwining operators, we can construct
three types of ladder operators for @xmath which are given by:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.5.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Let us denote these operators in the compact form @xmath , @xmath , and
use ( 7.5.1 ) and ( 7.5.2 ) to obtain the commutation relations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.5.8)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.5.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and @xmath are the corresponding eigenvalues of the seed states in the
positive and negative schemes. Equations ( 7.5.8 ) are three different
but related copies of the nonlinearly deformed conformal algebra @xmath
. One can verify the commutators between generators with different
values of index @xmath do not vanish, and therefore the complete
structure is rather complicated.

Similarly to the non-deformed case, be means of a unitary transformation
produced by @xmath we obtain the integrals of motion @xmath , and by
linear combinations of them construct the Hermitian generators @xmath
and @xmath , which generate three copies of a nonlinear deformation of
the Newton-Hooke algebra,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (7.5.10)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- ----------

which are hidden symmetries of the system described by @xmath .

In the isospectral case, the operators @xmath are the spectrum
generating ladder operators, where their action on physical eigenstates
of @xmath is similar to that of @xmath in the AFF model. On the other
hand, in rationally extended gapped systems obtained by Darboux
transfromations based on the schemes not containing Jordan states, the
separated states have the form @xmath , where the states @xmath belong
to the negative scheme and @xmath are the omitted states in the
corresponding dual positive scheme. Since by construction the separated
states belong to the kernel of @xmath , the operators @xmath and @xmath
will always annihilate all them.

In summary, the resulting picture is more or less the same as we had for
the cases analyzed in the previous chapters. We have three pairs of
ladder operators; @xmath detect the upper and lower energy levels of
each isolated valence band, @xmath operators annihilate all the isolated
states, and @xmath operators connect isolated states with the
equidistant part of the spectrum.

### 7.6 An example

In this section we will apply the machinery of the dual schemes and the
construction of nonlinear deformations of the conformal algebra to a
nontrivial example of rationally extended systems with gaps. Remember
that if we take @xmath , we replace @xmath by @xmath with @xmath when
@xmath in each of the relations that we have in the following, see Sec.
7.3 .

Consider a system generated on the base of the Darboux-dual schemes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.6.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Here, @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . The positive scheme, whose
Wronskian is given explicitly in ( 7.3.8 ), corresponds to the
Krein-Adler scheme that provides us with the system

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.6.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

whose potential @xmath is plotted in Figure 7.5 . The spectrum of the
system, @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , is characterized by the
presence of the gap of the size @xmath , which appears between the first
and second excited states. The negative scheme generates the shifted
Hamiltonian operator @xmath . In terms of the intertwining operators
@xmath and @xmath of the respective positive and negative schemes, the
physical eigenstates of ( 7.6.2 ) are given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.6.3)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.6.4)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

The explicit form of the polynomials ( 7.5.9 ) for the system is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.6.5)
     @xmath      (7.6.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and so, @xmath and @xmath .

The spectrum-generating ladder operators are given by Eq. ( 7.5.7 ), and
the nonlinearly deformed conformal algebras generated by each
corresponding pair of the ladder operators and the Hamiltonian @xmath
are obtained from ( 7.5.8 ) by using polynomials ( 7.6.5 ) and ( 7.6.6
). To clarify physical nature of the ladder operators, one can inspect
their corresponding kernels by using relations ( 7.1.12 ) and ( 7.5.5 ).
As a result, one gets that the physical eigenstates annihilated by these
operators are indicated in figure 7.5 and all other functions in the
respective kernels are nonphysical solutions.

### 7.7 Remarks

Note that the group @xmath can also be discussed in the context of
Schrödinger equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (7.7.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

the stationary solutions of which are @xmath , where @xmath . The
transformation @xmath gives us the modified Bessel functions, besides
@xmath produces singular solutions when @xmath is not a half-integer
number. In the case @xmath with @xmath we have that @xmath .

## Chapter 8 Three-dimensional conformal mechanics in a monopole
background

The conformal algebra shown in Chap. 2 can be realized in
higher-dimensional models. In the same sense, the conformal bridge is an
algebraic construction, independent of the realization. This means that
it also works for these higher-dimensional generalizations.

In this chapter, we will study a direct generalization of the AFF model
in three dimensions, whose Hamiltonian corresponds to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.0.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath , @xmath , @xmath is a U(1) gauge potential of a Dirac
magnetic monopole at the origin with charge @xmath , @xmath , and the
coupling @xmath should be chosen appropriately to prevent a fall to the
center, see below. We solve the Hamiltonian equations, study the
conformal Newton-Hooke symmetry of the system, and investigate a hidden
symmetry which appears in a special case @xmath , @xmath . The results
of this chapter are based on the article [ Inzunza et al. ( 2020a ) ]
which was inspired by the line of reasoning used in [ Plyushchay and
Wipf ( 2014 ) ] to identify the hidden symmetry and characterize the
particle’s trajectories.

### 8.1 Classical case

The particle’s coordinates and kinetic momenta obey the Poisson brackets
relations @xmath @xmath and @xmath which give rise to the equations of
motion

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath . From ( 8.1.1 ) we derive the equations @xmath and @xmath
where we denote @xmath , and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is the conserved Poincaré vector identified as the angular momentum of
the system,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In terms of this conserved quantity the Hamiltonian can be presented in
the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which reveals that the variables @xmath and @xmath , @xmath , behave
like @xmath and @xmath in the one-dimensional AFF model ( 2.1.16 ). From
( 8.1.4 ) one also reads the following assertions:

-   There is no fall to the center if @xmath , i.e. @xmath , that we
    will assume from now on.

-   The possible values of the angular momentum @xmath and energy obey
    the relation @xmath

-   The turning points for the radius are

      -- -------- -- ---------
         @xmath      (8.1.5)
      -- -------- -- ---------

On the other hand, to solve the equations of motion it is worth
parameterizing @xmath as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.1.6)
     @xmath      (8.1.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

From ( 8.1.7 ) and the equation of motion for @xmath we get @xmath .
These relations involve a clockwise rotation of @xmath from the
perspective of vector @xmath . Thus, if @xmath is oriented along @xmath
, and @xmath , @xmath , where @xmath , the path of the particle is on
the upper sheet of the cone and @xmath rotates clockwise in the
horizontal plane. If on the other hand @xmath is oriented along @xmath
and @xmath , @xmath , then the path is again on the upper sheet of the
cone, but the vector @xmath rotates counterclockwise in the @xmath plane
looking from @xmath . We also note that when @xmath , then @xmath so
@xmath is co-linear to @xmath and there is no rotation at all. In the
following we exclude that case.

The corresponding solutions for the angular and radial variables are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.1.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the initial conditions @xmath and @xmath are assumed (also we
redefine @xmath ). By expressing time thought @xmath and introducing it
in to @xmath , we obtain the trajectory equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.1.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which shows us that the angular period is @xmath . The condition for a
periodic trajectory is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.1.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

From the definition of @xmath in ( 8.1.4 ) we find that the trajectories
are closed for arbitrary values of @xmath if and only if @xmath . On the
other hand, when @xmath , the trajectory will be closed only for special
values of the angular momentum given by the condition

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.1.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and in this case the condition @xmath takes the form @xmath . Figure 8.1
illustrates several particular orbits lying on the corresponding conical
surface in a general case @xmath and in the special case @xmath .
Trajectories @xmath are shown there for fixed values of @xmath , @xmath
and @xmath , but for different values of @xmath .

Below we shall see that when @xmath , the projection to the plane
orthogonal to @xmath of the trajectory shown on the last plot is an
ellipse centered at the origin of the coordinate system similarly to the
case of the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. This
corresponds to a fundamental universal property of the magnetic monopole
background which we discuss in the last section. Since the center of the
projected elliptical trajectory is in the center of an ellipse, the
angular period @xmath is twice the radial period @xmath , @xmath ,
similarly to the isotropic harmonic oscillator. This is different from
the picture of the finite orbits in Kepler problem where the force
center is in one of the foci, and as a result @xmath . This similarity
with the isotropic oscillator and contrast to the Kepler problem are
also reflected in the spectra of the systems at the quantum level.

As we have the AFF model form of the Hamiltonian in ( 8.1.4 ), we can
intermediately write the rest of the Newton-Hooke conformal algebra
generators. They are given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.1.12)
     @xmath      (8.1.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Together with @xmath they satisfy the algebra ( 2.1.30 ). The Casimir
invariant corresponds to @xmath .

To conclude this part of the analysis, we comment on the limit @xmath .
In this case the generators @xmath , @xmath and @xmath take the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.1.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and satisfy the conformal algebra.

The case @xmath of the system @xmath corresponds to a geodesic motion on
the dynamical cone [ Plyushchay ( 2000b , 2001 ) ] . The special case of
@xmath , on the other hand, was studied in [ Plyushchay and Wipf ( 2014
) ] . It was shown there that the trajectory of the particle, projected
to the plane orthogonal to @xmath , is a straight line along which the
projected particle’s motion takes place with constant velocity.
Consistently with these peculiar properties, in the special case @xmath
the system with @xmath possesses a hidden symmetry described by the
integral of motion @xmath being a sort of Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector, in
the plane orthogonal to which and parallel to @xmath the particle’s
trajectory lies [ Plyushchay and Wipf ( 2014 ) ] . In Fig. 8.2 some
plots of the trajectories are shown for the system ( 8.1.14 ).

#### 8.1.1 The case @xmath : hidden symmetries

In the case @xmath the particle described by the Hamiltonian ( 8.0.1 ),
which now is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.1.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

admits the vector integrals of motion responsible for the closed nature
of the trajectories for arbitrary choice of initial conditions. The
integrals are derived by an algebraic approach as in Fradkin’s
construction for the isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator [
Fradkin ( 1965 ) ] .

Let us first introduce the vector quantities

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (8.1.16)
     @xmath   @xmath      (8.1.17)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

Using the corresponding equations of motion for @xmath and is not
difficult to show that @xmath so they are dynamical integrals of motion.

The evaluation of these integrals in the initial conditions give us

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.1.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

thus, @xmath and @xmath are orthogonal to each other. On the other hand,
the lengths of these vectors are also dynamical integrals which for the
initial conditions take the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.1.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where we have taken into account Eqs. ( 8.1.18 ) and the second equation
in ( 8.1.5 ). The sum of their squares, however, is a true integral of
motion whose value is a function of @xmath and @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.1.20)
  -- -------- -- ----------

These vectors point in the direction of the semi-axes of the elliptic
trajectory in the plane orthogonal to @xmath . The lengths of semi-major
and semi-minor axes correspond to those of the vectors @xmath and @xmath
, and are equal to @xmath and @xmath . As it is shown in [ Inzunza
et al. ( 2020a ) ] , in a general case of @xmath , the periodic change
of the scalar product of @xmath and @xmath , which would not be
integrals, implies a precession of the orbit, see Fig. 8.1 .

Using the definition of @xmath and @xmath in ( 8.1.16 ) and ( 8.1.17 ),
we can express the position @xmath of the particle as follows,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.1.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where we again see that @xmath and @xmath correspond to the orthogonal
set that define the elliptic trajectory in the plane.

Alternatively, one can follow a more algebraic approach to extract
information on the trajectories without explicitly solving the equations
of motion. It is well known from the seminal paper [ Fradkin ( 1965 ) ]
that for the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator all
symmetries of the trajectories are encoded in a tensor integral of
motion. During the rest of this subsection we construct an analogous
tensor for the system at hand to find the trajectories by a linear
algebra techniques. We begin with the tensor integrals

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.1.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

They, unlike the vectors @xmath and @xmath , but like the quadratic
expression ( 8.1.20 ) are the true, not depending explicitly on time
integrals of motion, @xmath .

In accordance with ( 8.1.20 ), their components satisfy relations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.1.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

As the anti-symmetric part of @xmath is related to the Poincaré
integral, we only need to use the symmetric part @xmath , which is
related but not identical to Fradkin’s tensor. Since the vectors (
8.1.16 ), ( 8.1.17 ) are orthogonal to each other and to @xmath , we
immediately conclude that @xmath and @xmath are eigenvectors of @xmath
with eigenvalues equal, respectively, to zero and

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (8.1.24)
     @xmath   @xmath      (8.1.25)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

Also one can show that the quadratic form @xmath is time-independent,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.1.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In a coordinate system with orthonormal base @xmath and @xmath , the
quadratic form ( 8.1.26 ) simplifies to

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.1.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

With @xmath one ends up with the equation for an ellipse in the plane
orthogonal to @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.1.28)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The lengths of the semi-major axis and semi-minor axis of the ellipse
are @xmath and @xmath , in accordance with that was found above.

Finally, the symmetric tensor components integral @xmath satisfy the
Poisson bracket relations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.1.29)
     @xmath      (8.1.30)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath

In fact, the quantum version of the tensor @xmath was already considered
in [ Labelle et al. ( 1991 ) ] , but this is the first time that it has
been obtained and used at the classical level.

### 8.2 Quantum theory of the model with @xmath

The @xmath quantum @xmath theory @xmath of @xmath the @xmath system
@xmath with @xmath Hamiltonian @xmath ( 8.1.15 ) is discussed in details
in [ McIntosh and Cisneros ( 1970 ); Labelle et al. ( 1991 ); Inzunza
et al. ( 2020a ) ] and here we summarize the results. We shall use the
units in which @xmath and @xmath .

In coordinate representation the basic commutation relations are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In what follows we shall skip the hat symbol @xmath to simplify the
notation. The Hamiltonian ( 8.1.15 ) can be written as

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is just the quantum version of the Poincaré integral (
8.1.2 ), the components of which generate the @xmath symmetry. The Dirac
quantization condition implies that @xmath must take an integer or half
integer value [ Plyushchay ( 2000b , 2001 ) ] . Using the angular
momentum treatment we obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.2.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with @xmath , and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.2.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the indicated values for @xmath correspond to a super-selection
rule. The case @xmath corresponds just to the quantum harmonic isotropic
oscillator. Excluding the zero value for @xmath , i.e. implying that
@xmath takes any nonzero integer or half-integer value, the first
relation in ( 8.2.3 ) automatically provides the necessary inequality
@xmath . The functions @xmath are the (normalized) monopole harmonics [
Wu and Yang ( 1976 ); Lochak ( 1985 ); Plyushchay ( 2000b , 2001 ) ] ,
which are well defined functions if and only if the combination @xmath
is in @xmath .

Then, the eigenstates and the spectrum of @xmath are given by

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (8.2.5)
     @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath are the generalized Laguerre polynomials. The degeneracy of
each level depends on @xmath and corresponds to

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.2.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

It is remarkable that the system possesses @xmath degenerate ground
states. The ground states here are not invariant under the action of the
total angular momentum @xmath , although the Hamiltonian operator
commutes with @xmath and hence is spherically symmetric. Thus we see
some analog of spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry in the
magnetic monopole background. This is of course in contrast to the
isotropic harmonic oscillator in three dimensions which has a unique
spherically symmetric ground state and symmetry algebra @xmath .
According to [ Labelle et al. ( 1991 ) ] the symmetry algebra for the
system under investigation is @xmath . We do not further dwell on these
interesting aspects of symmetry but rather turn to the construction of
spectrum-generating ladder operators.

Note that the coefficients at radial, @xmath , and angular momentum,
@xmath , quantum numbers in the energy eigenvalue @xmath corresponds to
the ratio @xmath between the classical angular and radial periods in the
special case @xmath under investigation. This can be compared with the
structure of the principle quantum number @xmath defining the spectrum
in the quantum model of the hydrogen atom, where the corresponding
classical periods are equal.

The explicit wave functions in ( 8.2.5 ) are specified by the discrete
quantum numbers @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . Our target now is to
identify the ladder operators for radial, @xmath , and angular momentum,
@xmath , quantum numbers (we already have the ladders operators for
@xmath ), which are based on the conformal and hidden symmetries of the
system.

In the algebraic approach we do not fix the representation for the
position and momentum operators and thus use Dirac’s ket notation for
eigenstates.

Ladder operators for @xmath . Let us first consider the quantum version
of the @xmath symmetry,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the generators @xmath are the quantum versions of combinations of
Newton-Hooke symmetry generators in the Schrödinger picture at @xmath ,
i.e.,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.2.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and their action on the eigenstates is

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.2.9)
     @xmath      (8.2.10)
  -- -------- -- ----------

Ladder operators for @xmath . We introduce the complex vector operator

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.2.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

together with its Hermitian conjugation. The vector operator @xmath is
the quantum version of the complex classical quantity @xmath in
Schrödinger picture at @xmath , and its components satisfy the relations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.2.12)
     @xmath      (8.2.13)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The action of these operators is computed algebraically in [ Inzunza
et al. ( 2020a ) ] and for us is sufficient to consider @xmath and
@xmath and their actions on the ket-states

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (8.2.14)
     @xmath   @xmath      (8.2.15)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

where the squares of the positive coefficients are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.2.16)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ----------

We see that the operators @xmath and @xmath change the quantum numbers
@xmath and @xmath , but the result is a superposition of the two
eigenstate vectors. Their action is depicted in Fig. 8.3 .

Clearly, if we are working in a representation where @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath are simultaneously diagonalized, it would be rather natural to
try to find ladder operators that map a given eigenstate into just one
eigenstate with a different quantum number @xmath and not a
superposition of eigenstates (having in mind the picture of the usual
harmonic oscillator). To find such operators we introduce the nonlocal
operator

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.2.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and construct the operators

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.2.18)
  -- -------- -- ----------

together with their Hermitean conjugate. Actually @xmath and @xmath are
the third components of the vector operators @xmath and @xmath which are
given by ( 8.2.18 ) wherein @xmath and @xmath are replaced by @xmath and
@xmath on the right hand side. But in what follows it suffices to
consider @xmath and @xmath which are ladder operators for the energy,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.2.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

They decrease and increase the angular momentum according to

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (8.2.20)
     @xmath   @xmath      (8.2.21)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

and the analogous Hermitian conjugate relations. These nonlocal objects
were inspired by a similar construction presented in [ Quesne and
Moshinsky ( 1990 ) ] for the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic
oscillator.

Now one can generate in a simple way all eigenstates of the commuting
observables @xmath and @xmath by acting with the local ladder operators
@xmath and with the nonlocal ladder operators @xmath on just one
eigenstate. The same can be achieved with local ladder operators when
one uses @xmath instead of @xmath , but then the recursive construction
gets more involved, since @xmath map into a superposition of
eigenstates.

#### 8.2.1 The conformal bridge in monopole background

Here we show how the generators of the conformal symmetry as well as the
hidden symmetry of the quantum system ( 8.2.2 ) can be obtained from
generators of the corresponding symmetries of the quantum system studied
in [ Plyushchay and Wipf ( 2014 ) ] . This will be realized by means the
conformal bridge transformation introduced in Chap. 3 .

Similarly to the classical case, in the limit @xmath the quantum version
of the generators ( 8.1.14 ) has the form

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.2.22)
     @xmath      (8.2.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

They produce the quantum conformal algebra

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.2.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

The Hamiltonian @xmath is a non-compact generator of the conformal
algebra @xmath with a continuous spectrum @xmath . In the same limit and
in the quantum version, the vector integrals @xmath and @xmath transform
into vectors

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.2.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which we identify, respectively, as the Laplace-Runge-Lentz vector and
the Galilei boost generator for the system @xmath [ Plyushchay and Wipf
( 2014 ) ] in the Weyl-ordered form. The commutator relations of the
vectors @xmath and @xmath with the generators of the conformal algebra
are

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.2.26)
     @xmath      (8.2.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In order to go in the opposite direction, i.e., to recover our system
@xmath and its symmetry generators starting from the generators ( 8.2.22
), ( 8.2.23 ) and ( 8.2.25 ), we implement the conformal bridge
transformation [ Inzunza et al. ( 2020b ) ] ,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.2.28)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where generators are fixed at @xmath . A similarity transformation
generated by @xmath yields

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.2.29)
     @xmath      (8.2.30)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is the quantum Hamiltonian ( 8.2.2 ). Then, as we know from
Chap. 3 , the eigenstates of @xmath are mapped from the rank @xmath
Jordan states of zero energy of @xmath , which also satisfy the equation
@xmath . Besides, the coherent states are obtained from the wave-type
eigenstates of @xmath . On one hand, the mentioned Jordan states are

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.2.31)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and after the transformation we get

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.2.32)
  -- -------- -- ----------

On the other hand, the corresponding eigenstates of @xmath are

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.2.33)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and the normalized coherent states of @xmath are

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (8.2.34)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath , the term @xmath is the modified Bessel function of the
first kind, and we have put the modulus in its argument because @xmath
admits an analytic extension for complex values, as is usual for
coherent states.

### 8.3 Remarks

As we have shown, hidden symmetries appear only when @xmath . In this
case, one always has closed trajectories, the angular period is twice
the radial period, and even more, the projected dynamics in the plane
orthogonal to the Poincaré vector turns out to be similar to that of the
three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator trajectory. In fact,
such an interesting “coincidence” is actually an universal property of
the monopole background: Consider the system described by the
Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is an arbitrary central potential. The dynamical variables
@xmath and @xmath satisfy the same equations of motion as the vector
variables @xmath and @xmath when @xmath , where @xmath is the usual
angular momentum:

Therefore, the movement in the plane orthogonal to @xmath is equivalent
to the dynamics obtained in the absence of the magnetic monopole source,
and if we know the solutions @xmath and @xmath in the case @xmath , the
dynamic for @xmath and @xmath is at hand,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (8.3.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

On the other hand, if we take the system @xmath with arbitrary central
potential @xmath , the corresponding dynamical problem is reduced to
that of the system ( 8.3.1 ) with central potential @xmath . The
indicated similarities and relations allow, in particular, to identify
immediately the analog of the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector ( 8.2.25 ) for a
particle in the monopole background in the cases @xmath , @xmath and for
the Kepler problem with @xmath . This was done previously in [
Plyushchay ( 2001 ); Plyushchay and Wipf ( 2014 ) ] and [ Labelle et al.
( 1991 ) ] using different approaches.

In the next chapter we will study how to extend this picture to
supersymmetric quantum mechanics.

## Chapter 9 A charge-monopole superconformal model

In this chapter we extend our system by means of an additional
contribution in the Hamiltonian ( 8.2.2 ) that involves spin degrees of
freedom. The supplemented term describes a strong long-range spin-orbit
coupling and one of its direct consequences is the appearance of two
independent subsets of energy levels. In one of these subsets or towers,
infinitely degenerate energy levels appear, while in the other, the
levels have finite degeneration. The system is studied in detail in Sec.
9.1 .

In the Sec. 9.2 , we show that thanks to this term, the system
introduced earlier supports a factorization in terms of intertwining
operators that naturally leads us to a supersymmetric extension, which
is nothing more than a three-dimensional realization of the superalgebra
@xmath . Finally, in Sec. 9.3 , it is shown that by means of certain
dimensional reductions, it is possible to obtain supersymmetric AFF
models in their exact and spontaneously broken supersymmetric phase.
Something special about the models obtained in this way is that the
coupling constant in the potential is @xmath , where @xmath can takes
integer or half-integer values, starting from @xmath .

### 9.1 Introducing spin degrees of freedom: Spin-orbit coupling

Let us consider the following two Hamiltonians with strong spin-orbit
coupling

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.1.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The Hamiltonians @xmath are similar to those which appear as subsystems
of the nonrelativistic limit of the supersymmetric Dirac oscillator
discussed in [ Moshinsky and Szczepaniak ( 1989 ); Bentez et al. ( 1990
) ] . Thus the eigenvalue problems can be solved similarly as in those
references, but the usual spherical harmonics are replaced by the
monopole harmonics. Actually, if we choose a spin-orbit coupling @xmath
with @xmath , then the spectra of both Hamiltonians would be unbounded
from below. On the other hand, for @xmath all energies will have finite
degeneracy. Only in the very particular case @xmath , which we consider
here, the spectra are bounded from below and half of the energies have a
finite degeneracy whereas the other half have infinite degeneracy. This
reminds us the BPS-limits in field theory, where different interactions
balance and supersymmetry is observed.

The operators @xmath and @xmath commute and as a consequence @xmath
commute with the “total angular momentum”

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.1.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The possible eigenvalues of @xmath are @xmath . It is well-known how to
construct the simultaneous eigenstates of @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.1.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.1.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

on the right hand side are nonzero only if @xmath and if the
triangle-rule holds, which means that the total angular momentum @xmath
is either @xmath or @xmath . In the first case the eigenstates of the
total angular momentum are denoted by @xmath and in the second case by
@xmath . The sums ( 9.1.3 ) contain just two terms, since the eigenvalue
@xmath of the third spin-component @xmath is either @xmath or @xmath .
In the coordinate representation the wavefunctions corresponding to
these kets are given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.1.5)
     @xmath      (9.1.6)
  -- -------- -- ---------

If @xmath is integer-valued then @xmath is a non-negative integer and
@xmath a positive half-integer. If @xmath is half-integer, then @xmath
is a positive half-integer and @xmath is in @xmath .

The vector in ( 9.1.3 ) is a simultaneous eigenstate of @xmath with
eigenvalue @xmath , of @xmath with eigenvalue @xmath , of @xmath with
eigenvalue @xmath , where @xmath , and finally of the operator @xmath :

  -- -- -- ---------
           (9.1.7)
  -- -- -- ---------

As a consequence the action of the Hamiltonians in ( 9.1.1 ) on these
states is

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.1.8)
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.1.9)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

We see that the discrete eigenvalues of both Hamiltonians @xmath fall
into two families: in one family all energies are infinitely degenerate
and in the other family they all have finite degeneracy (due to their
dependence on the quantum number @xmath ). More explicitly, for @xmath
the eigenvalues of @xmath have infinite degeneracy and for @xmath they
have finite degeneracy @xmath , where @xmath . A similar peculiar
behavior is observed in the Dirac oscillator spectrum [ Moshinsky and
Szczepaniak ( 1989 ) ] .

Operators @xmath are the ladder operators for the magnetic quantum
number @xmath . The ladder operators for the radial quantum number are
given in ( 8.2.8 ), and their action on the simultaneous eigenstates
reads

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.1.10)
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.1.11)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

with coefficients defined in ( 8.2.10 ). Thus, as for the spin-zero
particle system in monopole background, we can easily construct local
ladder operators for @xmath and @xmath . But again, finding ladder
operators for @xmath is more difficult. One way to proceed is to follow
the ideas employed for the Dirac oscillator in [ Moshinsky and
Szczepaniak ( 1989 ); Bentez et al. ( 1990 ); Quesne and Moshinsky (
1990 ) ] . First we decompose the total Hilbert space in two subspaces,
@xmath , where each @xmath is spanned by the states @xmath . Actually we
can construct nonlocal operators which project orthonormally onto these
subspaces,

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.1.12)
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.1.13)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

and reproduce or annihilate the eigenstates,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (9.1.14)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In next step we introduce the operators

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (9.1.15)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where the nonlocal @xmath have been defined in ( 8.2.18 ). The presence
of the projectors will ensure that @xmath only acts on eigenstates in
@xmath , and its action on these eigenstates can be computed
straightforwardly using the relations ( 8.2.20 ) and ( 8.2.21 ):

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (9.1.16)
     @xmath      (9.1.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

These relations mean that the operators @xmath and their adjoint act as
ladder operators for the quantum number @xmath . Together with operators
@xmath they generate all eigenstates in the full Hilbert space from just
two eigenstates, one from each subspace @xmath .

### 9.2 The @xmath superconformal extension

In this subsection we construct and analyze supersymmetric partners of
the Hamiltonians @xmath by introducing factorizing operators. From these
we obtain two @xmath super-Poincaré quantum systems which are related to
each other by a common integral of motion which generates an @xmath
-symmetry. Supplementing the supercharges of one of these systems by
supercharges of another, we extend the @xmath super-Poincaré symmetry up
to the @xmath superconformal symmetry realized by a three-dimensional
system of spin-1/2 particle in a monopole background.

Consider the first-order scalar operators

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.2.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and their adjoint @xmath and @xmath . The products of these operators
with their adjoint are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.2.2)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath are given in ( 9.1.1 ). The associated superpartners take
the form

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.2.3)
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.2.4)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

wherein the projection of @xmath to the normal unit vector appears,

  -- -- -- ---------
           (9.2.5)
  -- -- -- ---------

The first order operators satisfy the intertwining relations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.2.6)
     @xmath      (9.2.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

To compute the action of the intertwining operators @xmath and @xmath in
eigenstates of @xmath is useful to express them in the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.2.8)
     @xmath      (9.2.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Then the strategy is to apply directly this operators on the eigenstates
of @xmath in their coordinate representation ( 9.1.5 ), obtaining in
this way the eigenstates of systems @xmath and @xmath . The action of
operators @xmath and @xmath in these new eigenvectors follows from the
intertwining relations ( 9.2.6 )-( 9.2.7 ). The final result is

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.2.10)
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.2.11)
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.2.12)
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.2.13)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

Where in coordinate representation the normalized spinors @xmath have
the explicit form

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.2.14)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

and @xmath are given in ( 9.1.6 ).

From these equations it is easy to show that

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.2.15)
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.2.16)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

and note that in one hand, @xmath are zero-modes of @xmath since they
are annihilated by @xmath , and on the other hand @xmath as well as
@xmath annihilate the set of states @xmath .

Having at hand the eigenstates @xmath , one may find spectrum-generating
ladder operators. In this context Eqs. ( 9.2.10 ), ( 9.2.11 ), ( 9.2.12
) and ( 9.2.13 ) can be used to construct such operators for the quantum
number @xmath . They read

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (9.2.17)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and act on the eigenvectors @xmath as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.2.18)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

Actually, the first order operators @xmath and @xmath factorize the
earlier considered second order ladder operator ( 8.2.8 ) according to
@xmath .

Having constructed lowering and raising operators for @xmath , we are
still missing ladder operators for @xmath and @xmath . For the latter we
may of course use @xmath , since @xmath , @xmath and their adjoint are
scalar operators with respect to @xmath . But once more, for the angular
momentum quantum number @xmath we can introduce nonlocal “dressed”
operators

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (9.2.19)
  -- -------- -- ----------

and their adjoint operators, where @xmath have been given in ( 9.1.15 ).
The operators @xmath are the analogs to @xmath for the vectors @xmath ,
as we can see from the equations

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (9.2.20)
     @xmath      (9.2.21)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In a final step we combine the four @xmath matrix Hamiltonians
introduced above into two @xmath matrix super-Hamiltonians as follows:

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (9.2.22)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In the limit @xmath they turn into different versions of the Dirac
oscillator in the nonrelativistic limit, see [ Moshinsky and Szczepaniak
( 1989 ) ] . Both operators commute with the @xmath -grading operator
@xmath , @xmath , and their difference is the (bosonic) integral of
motion

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (9.2.23)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath is a projector,

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (9.2.24)
  -- -------- -- ----------

In the fermionic sectors of the systems @xmath and @xmath we have the
nilpotent operators

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (9.2.25)
  -- -------- -- ----------

@xmath , and their adjoint operators.

The even integral @xmath in ( 9.2.23 ) generates an @xmath -symmetry for
both systems. Having in mind that @xmath and @xmath can be diagonalized
simultaneously, from now on we treat @xmath as the Hamiltonian of the
super-extended system and @xmath as its integral. Then, by
anti-commuting @xmath and @xmath we obtain the bosonic generator

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (9.2.26)
  -- -------- -- ----------

together with its adjoint. They are composed from the ladder operators
of sub-systems @xmath and @xmath of our system @xmath .

Taking together, these scalar generators with respect to

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (9.2.27)
  -- -------- -- ----------

obey the @xmath superalgebra mentioned in Chap. 2 , Eqs. ( 2.2.24 )-(
2.2.27 ), and therefore this construction maybe considered as
generalization of the super-extended AFF model to three dimensions.

The common eigenstates of @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
are given by

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (9.2.28)
  -- -------- -- ----------

which satisfy the eigenvalue equations

  -- -------- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.2.29)
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.2.30)
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.2.31)
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.2.32)
     @xmath   @xmath      (9.2.33)
  -- -------- -------- -- ----------

The operators @xmath and @xmath ( @xmath and @xmath ) defined in (
9.2.25 ), interchange the state vectors @xmath and @xmath according to
the rules in ( 9.2.10 ), ( 9.2.11 ) and ( 9.2.12 ), ( 9.2.13 ). The
ground states of @xmath ( @xmath ) which are given by @xmath ( @xmath )
are invariant under transformations generated by these fermionic
operators, therefore the quantum system @xmath exhibits the unbroken
@xmath Poincaré supersymmetry.

Finally, the spectrum-generating ladder operators for the supersymmetric
system correspond to operators @xmath and @xmath (associated with @xmath
), @xmath that change @xmath , and the matrix nonlocal operators

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (9.2.34)
  -- -------- -- ----------

related to the angular quantum number @xmath .

### 9.3 Dimensional reductions

The system studied in the last section and the one presented in Chap 2 ,
Sec. 2.2 share the same symmetry, and in this paragraph we will show
that they are related by a dimensional reduction. For the sake of
simplicity, we put @xmath here, and denote @xmath as @xmath .

The first step is to note that the Hamiltonian @xmath can be presented
in the following form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.3.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Then, to do the reduction we introduce the set of equations

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.3.2)
     @xmath      (9.3.3)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath and @xmath . @xmath and @xmath . Here, the most general
form of @xmath is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.3.4)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and effectively, operators @xmath are projectors onto the orthogonal
subspaces @xmath and @xmath . These states satisfy

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.3.5)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath and @xmath are the one-dimensional supersymmetric extension
of the AFF model in exact and spontaneously broken phase, see Chap 2 ,
Sec. 2.2 . Moreover, if we call as @xmath and @xmath (where index @xmath
is the Hamiltonian and so on) the bosonic and fermionic generators of
the three-dimensional system, respectively, and in the same vein @xmath
and @xmath are their analogs for one-dimensional system in their
respective supersymmetric phases, we get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.3.6)
     @xmath      (9.3.7)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In these equations the generators take the form of a direct product of
two matrix operators: In case of bosonic (fermionic) operators one has
@xmath ( @xmath ), where @xmath ( @xmath ) is a particular bosonic
(fermionic) operator of the one-dimensional AFF model in its
corresponding supersymmetric phase. Note that in the odd sector we still
have angular dependence due to @xmath .

To complete the reduction we introduce the operators

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.3.8)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and their adjoint, as well as the unitary operator

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.3.9)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Operators @xmath effectively integrate the angular variables, so the
bosonic generators do not change, but the fermionic generators are
transformed into

  -- -------- -- ----------
     @xmath      (9.3.10)
     @xmath      (9.3.11)
  -- -------- -- ----------

where @xmath . On the other hand, by means of the unitary transformation
produced by @xmath , we are able to present the bosonic and fermionic
generators, already transformed by @xmath , in the form @xmath and
@xmath , respectively. From these expressions one simply extracts the
one-dimensional generators by means of the projectors @xmath , and it is
also easy to show that the objects @xmath take the form of the
eigenstates of the AFF supersymmetric model divided by @xmath .

In summary, we have two schemes of dimensional reductions made up by a
projection on a subspace with fixed @xmath , the integration of the
remaining angular variables, and a unitary transformation. Let us denote
these two schemes as @xmath . Then, by applying the scheme @xmath (
@xmath ) in our three-dimensional @xmath @xmath superconformal system we
obtain a super-extension of the AFF model in the exact (spontaneously
broken) supersymmetric phase, and there is a one-to-one correspondence
between bosonic and fermionic generators of the three-dimensional model
with those associated with the one-dimensional model.

### 9.4 Remarks

We end this chapter with a comment related to supersymmetry and Dirac
Hamiltonian. Taking the nilpotent operators @xmath given in ( 9.2.25 ),
a Hermitian supercharge can be constructed, and this has the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (9.4.1)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath @xmath and @xmath is our grading operator in Sec. 9.2 .
Then the operator ( 9.4.1 ) can be viewed as a parity breaking Euclidean
Dirac operator with components of the gauge potential satisfying the
relations @xmath . Hence we are dealing with a new type of parity
breaking dyon background. Actually, the @xmath terms do not allow for an
@xmath supersymmetric extension and we only have @xmath supersymmetry,
with the second supercharge given by @xmath . It is interesting to
relate a parity-breaking Dirac operators with supersymmetric quantum
mechanics. In this context it is not clear whether a (pseudo)classical
supersymmetric system exists whose quantization would produce our
three-dimensional superconformal system, or we have here a kind of a
classical anomaly [ Gamboa and Plyushchay ( 1998 ) ] . Also, the fact
that the ground state is infinitely degenerate is maybe due to this
parity breaking term.

## Conclusions and Outlook

In conclusion, we recall the problems a) to d) that were originally
listed in the introduction, but now in the light of the obtained
results. This will also allow to point out interesting problems for
further research.

a) Connection between different mechanical systems through symmetries
We addressed the problem of establishing a mapping between the two forms
of dynamics (in the sense of Dirac [ Dirac ( 1949 ) ] ) associated with
conformal algebra.

The indicated mapping is the conformal bridge transformation introduced
in [ Inzunza et al. ( 2020a ) ] (Chap. 3 ), that relates an
asymptotically free system with an harmonically confined one. The
transformation maps rank @xmath Jordan states of the zero energy (and
eigenstates) of the first system to eigenstates (coherent states) of the
second. The conformal bridge also maps symmetry generators from one
system to the another. From its general nature, this mapping provides a
new approach to study higher dimensional (in the sense of degrees of
freedom) conformal invariant systems, such as the Calogero model [
Calogero ( 1969 , 1972 ) ] . Actually, we have already shown its
applicability for the Landau problem analyzed in Chap. 3 , as well as
for the monopole background model in Chap. 8 . A fairly natural question
is whether there is any analog transformation at the level of
supersymmetric quantum mechanics, in such a way we could include in this
mapping fermionic integrals of motion. There could also be some
relationship between this transformation and the Riemann hypothesis,
since Hamiltonians of the form @xmath have been used in this direction [
Connes ( 1999 ); Berry and Keating ( 1999 ); Regniers and Van der Jeugt
( 2010 ); Sierra and Rodriguez-Laguna ( 2011 ); Bender et al. ( 2017 ) ]
.

b) Hidden and bosonized supersymmetry
We wanted to establish the origin of the hidden bosonized superconformal
symmetry of the harmonic oscillator in one dimension [ de Crombrugghe
and Rittenberg ( 1983 ); Balantekin et al. ( 1988 ); Cariñena and
Plyushchay ( 2016a ); Bonezzi et al. ( 2017 ) ] .

It was shown that such a bosonized supersymmetry originates from a
nontrivial supersymmetric system, via the nonlocal Foldy-Wouthuysen
transformation [ Inzunza and Plyushchay ( 2018 ) ] (Chap. 4 ). The only
fermionic true integrals of that system are the trivial Pauli matrices,
and other operators are dynamical integrals, in the sense of the total
Heisenberg equation. In contrast to the usual super-harmonic oscillator,
the system has spontaneously broken supersymmetry. We explain the nature
of this system through confluent Darboux transformation and in the
scheme of free anomaly quantization for second order supersymmetry [
Plyushchay ( 2000a ); Klishevich and Plyushchay ( 2001 ); Plyushchay (
2017 ) ] . The question about what happens in higher dimensional cases
remains open, however we think that the conformal bridge transformation
could provide us an answer.

c) Hidden symmetries in rationally extended conformal mechanics
The objective was to find the spectrum generating ladder operators for
rational deformations of the AFF model and its supersymmetric
extensions.

We have used the DCKA transformation to produce a rational extension of
the AFF model. The nature of the resulting Hamiltonians depends on the
choice of the seed states: We can produce isospectral and
non-isospectral rational deformations that have an arbitrary number of
gaps of different sizes in their spectra. Starting from the harmonic
oscillator [ Cariñena et al. ( 2018 ) ] (Chap. 5 ), we implemented an
algorithmic procedure that takes a set of seed states for DCKA
transformation (them could be physical or nonphysical, but not a
mixture), and produces a new set of seed states of a different nature.
Both Darboux schemes essentially generate the same system, up to an
additive constant. This is what we called a Darboux duality for the
harmonic oscillator, and we have used it to construct the
spectrum-generating ladder operators for rational deformations of the
AFF model with potential @xmath where @xmath . These ladder operators
fall into three categories; Operators of the type @xmath that
irreducibly act on the equidistant part of the spectrum but annihilate
all separate states. Operators of type @xmath that act similarly to
@xmath on the equidistant part of the spectrum but annihilate only the
upper (rising operator) and lower (lowering operator) states in each
separate band. Finally, operators of type @xmath , that connect the
separated part of the spectrum with its equidistant part. These results
are analogous to what was obtained for rational extensions of the
harmonic oscillator in [ Cariñena and Plyushchay ( 2017 ) ] .

This phenomenon in which different possible options of Darboux schemes
produce the same system, also appears in the context of deformations of
the free particle, specifically, in the construction of the so-called
reflectionless potentials, see [ Matveev and Salle ( 1991 ) ] for a
background on the subject. The main difference between these systems and
the rational deformations of the harmonic oscillator (as well as
deformations of the AFF model), is that the Darboux schemes produce
there the same potential without any additive constant. This implies
that the Darboux dressing procedure provides there the true integrals of
motion, which are the so-called Lax-Novikov integrals, see [ Correa
et al. ( 2008 ); Arancibia et al. ( 2013 ); Arancibia and Plyushchay (
2014 ); Arancibia et al. ( 2014 ); Plyushchay ( 2020 ) ] for more
information.

The next step was to study the complete nonlinear supersymmetry that
characterizes the rational super-extensions of the AFF model and the
harmonic oscillator [ Inzunza and Plyushchay ( 2019a ) ] (Chap. 6 ). By
means of a set of algebraic relations, we have obtained a large chain of
new higher-order dynamical integrals that act irreducibly in the system,
in a similar way as powers of the first-order ladder operators do in the
case of the simplest harmonic oscillator. We stopped the generation of
integrals when we realized that certain objects can be written in terms
of more basic elements than they are, otherwise one would have an
infinite-dimensional algebra of the @xmath type, see [ de Boer et al. (
1996 ) ] and references therein. With fermionic generators we have a
similar picture. Despite having so many new operators, which we cannot
avoid because they arise from the commutation relations between
operators of the type @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , the role they play is
not clear since the spectrum-generating set was already built. Perhaps
there is a more basic structure behind this construction, hidden in the
virtual systems produced by the Darboux chain, but this is still an open
question. In this context, another interesting problem to investigate is
whether these higher order generators can be obtained by means of a
quantization prescription of a pseudo-classical system, however one must
bear in mind that higher order supersymmetry presents a quantum anomaly
[ Klishevich and Plyushchay ( 2001 ); Plyushchay ( 2017 ) ] .

In [ Inzunza and Plyushchay ( 2019b ) ] (Chap. 7 ) we extend the Darboux
duality to the case of the AFF model with potential @xmath , where
@xmath . This is possible due to the Klein four-group associated to the
Schrödinger equation of the model. Having the Darboux duality for this
system allows us to extend the notion of the three classes of ladder
operators described above, now for any possible deformation of the AFF
model. We have not considered spectrum-generating algebras and
supersymmetric extensions for these cases, so this remains as an open
problem. Within all this, the cases in which @xmath is a half-integer
number are really special: When this happens, the confluent Darboux
transformation is involved in some of the recipes for constructing
rationally extended potentials, and some rational extensions undergo
significant structural changes. Such changes are reflected both in the
available energy levels, such as in the number of physical states, and
also in the kernels of the of spectrum-generating ladder operators,
where now nonphysical states and Jordan states appear.

On the other hand, systems very similar to these, but without the
harmonic term, appeared in a completely different context, through the
so-called @xmath regularization [ Correa and Fring ( 2016 );
Mateos Guilarte and Plyushchay ( 2017 , 2019 ) ] . These models are
intimately related to the Korteweg-de Vries equation due to the Lax pair
formalism [ Matveev and Salle ( 1991 ) ] and help to provide new types
of solutions. It would be interesting to clarify if there is a
generalization of the conformal bridge for deformed systems, that could
provide us a new knowledge related to integrable models.

d) Hidden symmetries in three-dimensional conformal mechanics
For this problem, we have considered a particle with electric charge
@xmath in a Dirac monopole background, i.e., a @xmath external vector
potential @xmath , the curl of which gives us the spherically symmetric
magnetic field produced by a monopole source with charge @xmath , see
details in [ Sakurai ( 1994 ); McIntosh and Cisneros ( 1970 ); Labelle
et al. ( 1991 ); Inzunza et al. ( 2020a ) ] and in the references cited
there. The particle was also subjected to a central potential of the
form @xmath . We investigated the possibility of obtaining hidden
integrals of motion for this system, and we also looked for a possible
supersymmetric extension of this model.

It was found that the system has hidden symmetries when @xmath . At the
classical level, they control the periodic nature of the trajectory,
besides in the quantum case, these integrals reveal the nature of
spectrum degeneration of the system.

To construct the hidden integrals at the classical level, we have used
the fact that the projection of the particle’s trajectory into the
orthogonal plane to the Poincaré vector integral (the modified angular
momentum of the system), is analogous to the orbit of the
three-dimensional harmonic oscillator. Actually, we demonstrated that
this is a universal property of this background, i.e., if we change the
harmonic trap for an arbitrary central potential, the dynamics in the
mentioned plane will be the same that would occur in the absence of the
monopole charge.

It is also necessary to emphasize that the system has the @xmath
symmetry and is connected with an @xmath invariant system previously
analyzed in [ Plyushchay and Wipf ( 2014 ) ] , by means of the conformal
bridge transformation. This brings us another way to get the integrals
of the hidden symmetries.

Inspired by the so-called “Dirac oscillator” proposed in [ Moshinsky and
Szczepaniak ( 1989 ); Bentez et al. ( 1990 ); Quesne and Moshinsky (
1990 ) ] , we introduced a special spin-orbit coupling term into the
Hamiltonian of our system in the monopole background (Chap. 9 ), and
this naturally leads us to the construction of a supersymmetric
extension. The resulting model is a three-dimensional realization of the
@xmath superconformal symmetry, and some of its interesting proprieties
appear in the following list:

-   In the limit @xmath , the Hamiltonian of our system takes the form

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    which is identified with the mentioned Dirac oscillator Hamiltonian
    in the non-relativistic limit.

-   In the limit @xmath , our Hamiltonian operator is transformed into

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    which @xmath is @xmath interpreted @xmath as @xmath the @xmath Pauli
    @xmath Hamiltonian @xmath of @xmath a @xmath supersymmetric dyon
    @xmath [ Plyushchay and Wipf ( 2014 ) ] . This system has the
    exceptional superconformal symmetry @xmath with @xmath , which is
    larger than @xmath superalgebra, so we believe that some important
    structures are still missing in our construction.

-   The system has two classes of energy levels organized in two
    independent towers. The eigenvalues associated with one of these
    towers are infinitely degenerate, while the energies in the other
    tower have finite degeneracy.

-   Through the application of two different dimensional reduction
    schemes, the system is transformed into the super-extended AFF
    model. One scheme gives us the extended system in the spontaneously
    broken supersymmetric phase, while the other scheme produces the
    system in the exact supersymmetric phase.

This type of system opens an interesting line of research, which
consists in exploring the supersymmetric structure of a Dirac
Hamiltonian that breaks parity symmetry (since the Hermitian
supercharges of our model can be interpreted in this way), and searching
for applications for systems with infinitely degenerate ground energy.
