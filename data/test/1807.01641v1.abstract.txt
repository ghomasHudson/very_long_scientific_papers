We introduce the notion of a weak (homotopy) moment map associated to a
Lie group action on a multisymplectic manifold. We show that the
existence/uniqueness theory governing these maps is a direct
generalization from symplectic geometry.

We use weak moment maps to extend Noether’s theorem from Hamiltonian
mechanics by exhibiting a correspondence between multisymplectic
conserved quantities and continuous symmetries on a multi-Hamiltonian
system. We find that a weak moment map interacts with this
correspondence in a way analogous to the moment map in symplectic
geometry.

We define a multisymplectic analog of the classical momentum and
position functions on the phase space of a physical system by
introducing momentum and position forms. We show that these differential
forms satisfy generalized Poisson bracket relations extending the
classical bracket relations from Hamiltonian mechanics. We also apply
our theory to derive some identities on manifolds with a torsion-free
@xmath structure.
