In Fig. 5.1 , we give a plot of the KK wave functions along the extra
dimension.

The summary table is the same as for the interval: Tab. 4.1 , which
illustrates the duality between the interval and the orbifold @xmath up
to a factor two in the mass spectrum and the normalization of the wave
functions.

In the orbifold description, the essential boundary conditions are
related to the continuity of the odd fields across the fixed points. In
the interval description, they come from the requirement of vanishing
transverse conserved currents at the boundaries.

The BBTs are justified by four different ways: (i) there is no physical
solutions without them; (ii) They have a geometrical role in the sense
that either they take into account the boundary of the interval
(vanishing currents) or they specify the field junction in the case of a
periodic extra dimension; (iii) they allow the 4D/5D matching; (iv) they
appear from the weak derivative of the fields treated as distributions.

As in the case of the interval, in the 4D approach, the @xmath -terms do
not affect the mass matrix. In the 5D approach, @xmath is implied by the
vanishing of the variation of the action at the fixed points. So there
is a 4D/5D matching regarding the independance of the @xmath parameter.
This result hold in both the approaches with functions/distributions and
interval/orbifold.
