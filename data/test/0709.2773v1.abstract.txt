This paper is a slightly modified version of the introductory part of a
doctoral dissertation also containing the articles hep-ph/0311268,
hep-ph/0510375, hep-ph/0512177 and hep-ph/0701250. The thesis discusses
effective field theory methods, in particular dimensional reduction, in
the context of finite temperature field theory. We first briefly review
the formalism of thermal field theory and show how dimensional reduction
emerges as the high-temperature limit for static quantities. Then we
apply dimensional reduction to two distinct problems, the pressure of
electroweak theory and the screening masses of mesonic operators in hot
QCD, and point out the similarities. We summarize the results and
discuss their validity, while leaving all details to original research
articles.
