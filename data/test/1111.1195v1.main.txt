### Introduction

In this thesis, we wish to present some predictions for the Higgs
boson(s) study at the two largest hadron colliders currently in
activity: the Fermilab Tevatron collider and the CERN Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). Our focus will be on the inclusive production cross
sections and the decay branching fractions, first in the Standard Model
which in itself is the topic of part I and then in its minimal
supersymmetric extension which is the topic of part III .

The study of the fundamental mechanisms of Nature at the elementary
level has a long story and has known many milestones in the past sixty
years. Physicists have built a theory, nowadays known as the Standard
Model, to describe the elementary particles and their interactions, that
are those of the strong, weak and electromagnetic, the two last being
unified in a single electroweak interaction. It relies on the elegant
concept of gauge symmetry within a quantum field theory framework and
has known many experimental successes: despite decades of effort to
surpass this model it is still the one that describes accurately nearly
all the known phenomena ¹ ¹ 1 We leave aside the neutrino mass issue. .
One of its key concepts is the spontaneous breakdown of electroweak
symmetry: indeed in order to give mass to the weak bosons that mediate
the weak interaction, a scalar field is introduced in the theory whose
vacuum breaks the electroweak symmetry and gives mass to the weak
bosons. In fact it also gives masses to the fermions and one piece of
this mechanism remains to be discovered: the Higgs boson, the “Holy
Grail” of the Standard Model. Its discovery is one of the main goal of
current high energy colliders.

It is then of utmost importance to give theoretical predictions for the
production cross sections and decay branching fractions of the Higgs
boson at current colliders to serve as a guideline for experiments.
However, the hadronic colliders are known to be very difficult
experimental environments because of the huge hadronic, that is Quantum
ChromoDynamics (QCD), activity. This is also true on a theoretical side,
which means that an accurate description of all possible sources of
theoretical uncertainties is needed: this is precisely the main output
of this thesis. We shall mention that in the very final stage of this
thesis new results have been presented in the HEP–EPS 2011 conference;
our work is to be read in the light of the results that were available
before these newest experimental output which will be briefly commented
in the conclusion.

Part I is entirely devoted to a review of the Standard Model. In section
1 we will draw a short history of the Standard Model and list its main
milestones of the past sixty years, followed by a description of its
main concepts. We will go into more details about the Higgs mechanism,
which spontaneously breaks electroweak symmetry, in section 2 : we will
review some reasons to believe that either the Higgs mechanism itself or
something which looks like the Higgs mechanism is needed, and then how
the Higgs boson emerges from the electroweak symmetry breaking and what
are its couplings to fermions and bosons of the Standard Model.

Part II is the core of the Standard Model study of this thesis. Indeed
the Higgs boson remains to be discovered and is one of the major
research programs at current high energy colliders. The old CERN Large
Electron Positron (LEP) collider has put some bounds on the possible
value of the Higgs boson mass, which is above 114.4 GeV in the Standard
Model at 95%CL. We will review in section 3 the current experimental and
theoretical bounds on the Higgs mass. We then give our predictions for
the Standard Model Higgs boson inclusive production cross section at the
Tevatron in the two main production channels that are the gluon–gluon
fusion and the Higgs–strahlung processes, giving all the possible
sources of theoretical uncertainties: the scale uncertainty viewed as an
estimation of the unknown higher–order terms in the perturbative
calculation; the parton distribution functions (PDFs) uncertainties
related to the non–perturbative QCD processes within the proton, and its
related strong coupling constant issue; the uncertainty coming from the
use of an effective theory approach to simplify the hard calculation in
the gluon–gluon fusion process. We will specifically address the issue
of the combination of all the uncertainties in section 4.5 . We will
then move on to the same study at the LHC, concentrating on its current
run at a 7 TeV center–of–mass energy that we will name as the lHC for
littler Hadron Collider; we will still give some predictions for the
designed LHC at 14 TeV. We will finish this part II by the Higgs boson
decay branching fractions predictions in section 6 , together with a
detailed study of the uncertainties that affect these predictions. It
will be followed by the combination of the production cross sections and
decay branching fractions into a single prediction, first at the
Tevatron in section 6.3 and then at the lHC in section 6.4 . We will
then study the impact of our uncertainties on the Tevatron Higgs
searches in section 6.5 and in particular put into question the Tevatron
exclusion limits that are debated within the community.

Even if the Standard Model is a nice theory with great experimental
successes, it suffers from some problems, both on the theoretical and
experimental sides. It is known for example that the Higgs boson mass is
not predicted by the Standard Model, and even not protected: higher
order corrections in the perturbative calculation of the Higgs boson
mass have the tendency to drive the mass up to the highest acceptable
scale of the theory which means that we need a highly fine–tuning of the
parameters to cancel such driving. It is known as the naturalness
problem of the Standard Model. They are several ways to solve such a
problem, and one of them is particularly elegant and relies on a new
symmetry between bosons and fermions: supersymmetry. This theoretical
concept, born in the 1970s, has many consequences when applied to the
Standard Model of particle physics and is actively searched at current
high energy colliders. This will be the topic of part III in which we
will review some of the reasons that drive the theorists to go beyond
the Standard Model and in particular what makes supersymmetry
interesting in this view in section 7 , then move on to the description
of the mathematical aspects of supersymmetry in section 8 . We will
finish this part III by a very short review of the minimal
supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model, called the MSSM, in
section 9 . We will in particular focus on the Higgs sector of the
theory and show that the MSSM needs two Higgs doublets to break the
electroweak symmetry breaking and has thus a rich Higgs sector as five
Higgs boson instead of a single one are present in the spectrum: two
neutral @xmath –even, one @xmath –odd and two charged Higgs bosons.

After this review of supersymmetry and the MSSM we will reproduce in
part IV the same outlines that have been developed in part II in the
Standard Model case. We will first review the neutral Higgs sector at
hadron colliders in section 10 and show that we can have a quite
model–independent description for our predictions in the sense that they
will hardly depend on most of the (huge) parameters of the MSSM but two
of them, the mass of the @xmath –odd Higgs boson @xmath and the ratio
@xmath between the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets.
We will then give in section 11 our theoretical predictions for the
neutral Higgs bosons inclusive production cross section at the Tevatron
in the two main production channels that are the gluon–gluon fusion and
the bottom quark fusions, the bottom quark playing a very important role
in the MSSM at hadron colliders. We will reproduce the same study at the
lHC in section 12 before giving the implications of our study on the
@xmath parameter space in section 13 . We will first give in this last
section our predictions for the main MSSM decay branching fractions and
in particular the di–tau branching fraction that is of utmost importance
for experimental searches. We we will then compare our predictions
together with their uncertainties to the experimental results obtained
at the Tevatron and at the lHC that has now been running for more than a
year at 7 TeV and given impressive results. We will see that the
theoretical uncertainties have a significant impact on the Tevatron
results, less severe at the lHC. We will finish section 13 by a very
important outcome of our work: the possibility of using the MSSM neutral
Higgs bosons searches in the di–tau channel for the Standard Model Higgs
boson in the gluon–gluon fusion production channel followed by the
di–tau decay channel in the low Higgs boson mass range 115–140 GeV.

Finally, we will give an outlook and draw some conclusions in part V
together with some perspectives for future work. These rest on the next
step on the road of the experiments, that is an exclusive study of the
Higgs bosons production channels. We shall give some early results in
section 14 on the Standard Model Higgs boson at the lHC in the @xmath
search channel together with an exclusive study of the main Standard
Model backgrounds. This is also the current roadmap of the Higgs bosons
theoretical community and this work is done in the framework of a
collaboration on this topic.

## Part I A brief review of the Standard Model of particle physics

### 1 Symmetry principles and the zoology of the Standard Model

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is the current description
of the fundamental constituents of our universe together with the
interactions that occur between them. The SM was born in its current
form in the seventies, after nearly twenty years of many experiments and
theoretical reflexions on how to build a somewhat simple and elegant
model to describe accurately the experimental results on the one hand
and to make powerful predictions in order to have a falsifiable theory
on the other hand. Its frameworks are relativistic quantum field theory
and group theory to classify the different interactions. It also needs
the key concept of spontaneous (electroweak) symmetry breaking in order
to account for the masses of the different fields in the theory, the
(weak) bosons as well as the matter fermions. Other reasons also push
for such a theoretical concept and will be presented in the next
sections.

We will in this section present a short review of the major historical
points in the birth of the SM, and present its theoretical fundations.
The focus on the electroweak symmetry breaking, in particular its
minimal realization through the Brout–Englert–Higgs mechanism, will be
discussed in the next section.

#### 1.1 A brief history of the Standard Model

This subsection will sketch the different historical steps that have
lead to the current form of the theory that describes the elementary
particles and their interactions among each other, called the Standard
Model (SM). This model has a very rich history over more than fifty
years of the XX @xmath century, not to mention all the diverse and
fruitful efforts made before to attain this level of description of the
elementary world. We will only select some (of the) outstanding events,
both from the theoretical and experimental sides, to present the twisted
path leading to the current Standard Model of particle physics.

###### The birth of modern QED

The first attempt to decribe electromagnetic phenomena in the framework
of special relativity together with quantum mechanics can be traced back
in the 1920s. In particular Dirac was the first to describe the
quantization of the electromagnetic fields as an ensemble of harmonic
oscillators, and introduced the famous creation–annihilation operators [
1 ] . In 1932 came Fermi with a first description of quantum
electrodynamics [ 2 ] , but physicists were blocked by the infinite
results that did arise in the calculations beyond the first order in
perturbation theory.

Years after, the difficulty was solved by Bethe in 1947 [ 3 ] with the
concept of renormalization, that is the true physical quantities are not
the bare parameters of the theory, and thus the infinite that arise are
absorbed in the physical quantities, leaving finite results in the end.
This leads to the modern Quantum ElectroDynamics (QED) with the key
concept of gauge symmetry and renormalization, that was formulated by
Feynman, Schwinger and Tomonaga [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] in the years 1950s and
awarded by a Nobel prize in 1965. This is the first quantum field theory
available and has been the root of all the SM ideas for the key concepts
of gauge symmetry and renormalizability.

###### P violation and @xmath weak theory

It was long considered in physics that the parity symmetry was
conserved: if we repeated an experiment with the experimental apparatus
mirror reversed, the results would be the same as for the initial
set–up. This assessment is true for any experiment involving
electromagnetism or strong interaction, but that is not the case for
weak interaction.

It was first proposed by Yang and Lee in 1956 that the weak interaction
might indeed not respect P–symmetry [ 7 ] . This was observed in 1957 by
Chien-Shiung Wu (“Madam Wu”) in the beta desintegration of cobalt 60
atoms [ 8 ] . Yang and Lee were then awarded the 1957 Nobel prize for
their theoretical developments on this concept.

Up until that period, the weak interaction, that shapes the decay of
unstable nucleii, was described by the Fermi theory in which the
fermions interact through a four–particles vertex. The discovery of the
@xmath –violation lead to the construction of an effective @xmath theory
where the tensor structure of the thory is correct and does respect the
charge and parity violations. This @xmath theory was later on replaced
by the electroweak theory, see below.

###### The quark description

In the first half of the XX @xmath century the pattern of elementary
particles was simple: the electron (and its antiparticle the positron,
postulated by Dirac in 1931 and discovered in 1932 by Anderson), the
proton and the neutron were the only known elementary particles at that
time. The neutrino, first postulated by Pauli in its famous letter in
1930 to save the energy--momentum conservation in beta decay reactions ²
² 2 The original name was “neutron” for neutral particle. Chadwick
discovered in 1932 what would be the neutron, thus Fermi proposed the
name “neutrino” meaning “little neutral one” in italian. was discovered
only in 1956.

Experimental particle physicists discovered numerous new particles (the
“hadrons”) in the 1950s and 1960s after the discovery of the pion in
1947, predicted by Yukawa in 1935, thus casting some doubts on the
elementary nature both of the “older” particles such as the neutron and
the proton and on the new zoo discovered. Gell–Man and Zweig proposed in
1964 a model of constituant particles of these hadrons and mesons that
could explain the pattern seen by experimentalists, using only a limited
number of new constituant particles: the quarks [ 9 , 10 ] . They
introduce the @xmath flavor symmetry with the three up, down and strange
quarks. One year later the charm quark was proposed to improve the
description of weak interactions between quarks, and in 1969 deep
inelastic scattering experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) discovered point–like objects within the proton [ 11 ] ,
an experimental proof of the compositeness of the hadrons. It is
interesting to note that the term used for these new point–like objects
was “parton”, proposed by Feynman, as the community was not entirely
convinced that they were indeed the Gell–Mann’s quarks. Nowadays
“parton” is still a word used in particle physics to name the different
constituants of the hadrons (the quarks, antiquarks and gluons, the
later being the bosons of the strong interaction).

The (nearly) final word on the quark model was given in 1974 when the
@xmath meson was discovered [ 12 , 13 ] and thus proved the existence of
the charm quark, which was proposed by Glashow, Iliopoulos and Maiani in
the GIM mechanism [ 14 ] in 1970 to explain the universality of weak
interaction in the quark sector, preventing flavor changing neutral
currents. The heaviest quark, that is the top quark, was finally
discovered in 1995 at the Fermilab Tevatron collider [ 15 , 16 ] .

###### CP violation and the concept of generation

To explain both the universality and the @xmath transitions in weak
interactions, Cabibbo introduced in 1963 what is known as the Cabibbo
angle [ 17 ] and was used to write in the mass eigenstates basis the
weak eigenstate for the down quark @xmath . A year later, Cronin and his
collaborators discovered that not only C and P symmetries are broken by
weak interactions, but also the combined CP symmetry [ 18 ] , studing
the @xmath oscillations: the probability of oscillating from @xmath
state into @xmath state is different from that of the @xmath ,
indicating that @xmath time reversal symmetry is violated. As the
combined CPT is assumed to be conserved, this means that CP is violated.

As mentioned a few lines above, the GIM mechanism introduced a fourth
quark, the charm quark @xmath . It then restores universality in the
weak coupling for the quarks, as we have now two weak eigenstates

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (1.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

coupled to respectively the @xmath quark and the @xmath quark. We thus
have two generations in the quark sector, the first one is the @xmath
doublet and the second one is the @xmath doublet. However, as explained
in 1973 by Kobayashi and Maskawa extending the work initiated by
Cabibbo, this is not sufficient to explain the CP violation observed by
the 1964 experiment. Only with three generations could be introduced
some CP violating effects through a phase angle, and thus extending the
Cabbibo angle to what is known as the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM)
matrix [ 19 ] . Kobayashi and Maskawa were awarded the 2008 Nobel prize
for this result ³ ³ 3 Unfortunately the Nobel committee failed to
recognize the important pionnering work from Cabibbo. .

###### Yang–Mills theory and spontaneous symmetry breaking

We have seen a few lines above that the Fermi theory describing the weak
interactions had been refined by the @xmath picture to take into account
the @xmath violation. Still the @xmath theory was known to be an
effective theory as the theory was not renormalizable and did not allow
for calculations beyond the first order in perturbation theory. The only
gauge theory that was available at that time was QED, an abelian gauge
theory, which obviously is not the right description of weak processes
as it describes only light–matter interactions.

The first step toward the solution was set–up in 1954, when Yang and
Mills developed a formulation of non–abelian gauge theories [ 20 ] in
order to provide (initially) an explanation for the strong interaction
at the hadron level (that we call nuclear interaction). Unfortunately
the theory was not a success at first, as the gauge bosons must remain
massless to preserve the symmetry of the theory, thus meaning that the
weak interaction should be long–range; experimentally that is not the
case.

The key result to solve this contradiction and then still use the
elegant description of gauge theory is given in 1964 by Brout, Englert,
Higgs, Guralnik, Hagen and Kibble after some important work on the
concept of symmetry breaking from Nambu and Goldstone: the spontaneously
gauge symmetry breaking [ 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ] described by the
Brout–Englert–Higgs mechanism. This will be presented in the following
in details, but we can already remind the reader that the most important
result is that it allows for the use of a Yang–Mills theory together
with a description of massive gauge bosons for any gauge theory.

###### Interlude: from nuclear force to strong interaction

Before arriving to the final electroweak description that constitutes
the heart of the SM, we recall the road leading to the description of
the strong interaction between the quarks.

As stated above, Yang–Mills theory in 1954 was the first attempt to
describe the interaction between the hadrons, that we call nuclear
interaction, in a gauge formulation. After the introduction of the quark
model by Gell–Mann in 1964 (see above) and the discovery of the quarks
in 1969 (see above), it has been proposed that the quarks must have a
new quantum charge, called color, to accomodate for the Pauli exclusion
principle within some baryons [ 25 ] . This was experimentally observed
in the SLAC experiments in 1969 which discovered point–like objects
within the nucleon, as discussed earlier.

With the help of the discovery of asymptotic freedom [ 26 , 27 ] in 1973
by Wilczek, Gross and Politzer (who share the 2004 Nobel prize for this
result), that states that at very high energy quarks are free, and with
a @xmath gauge Yang–Mills theory, Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD) was
firmly established in the 1970s as being the theory of the strong
interactions, with the gluons as the gauge bosons. Evidence of gluons
was discovered in three jet events at PETRA in 1979 [ 28 ] , giving
further credits to QCD.

The nuclear interaction between the hadrons is then a residual force
originating from the strong interaction between quarks (and gluons).
However, as the strong coupling is indeed very strong at large distance
(that is the confinement), preventing from the use of perturbation
theory, an analytical description of the strong interaction within the
hadrons at low energies is still to be found. This problem is now
studied within the framework of lattice gauge theories which give
spectacular results.

###### The weak neutral currents and the path to electroweak theory

As stated above it was known that the @xmath theory for the weak
interaction was an effective theory, with difficulties calculating
beyond the first order in perturbation theory. With the advent of
Yang–Mills theory and the Brout–Englert–Higgs mechanism, describing the
weak interaction with a gauge theory and in the same time allowing for
massive weak bosons as dictated by the experiments, the weak interaction
being a short distance interaction, it would be possible to account for
a renormalizable description of the weak interaction.

During the 1960s there were many attempts to carry on this roadmap,
trying lots of different gauge groups to account for the QED on the one
hand, the weak interaction on the other hand, as both interactions play
a role for lepton particles such as the electron. The gauge theory that
did emerge was the @xmath model where the weak and electromagnetic
interactions are unified in a single gauge theory description ⁴ ⁴ 4 It
is actually not a complete unified theory as the algebra describing the
electroweak interaction is a product of two Lie algebras. Nevertheless
as the decription of the weak and electromagnetic interactions are
intimely connected through the pattern of the electroweak symmetry
breaking, see below, this can be viewed as at least a partial
unification. , with contributions notabely from Glashow [ 29 ] , Salam [
30 ] and Weinberg [ 31 ] . This model together with the
Brout–Englert–Higgs mechanism predicts in particular that there should
be a neutral weak boson @xmath to be discovered and thus neutral
currents.

A very important theoretical discovery was made in 1971 by ’t Hooft, who
demonstrated that the electroweak theory is indeed renormalizable [ 32 ,
33 ] . A year after, together with Veltman, he also described for the
first time the dimensional regularization scheme for renormalizability
calculation [ 34 ] . That gave prominant credits to the electroweak
model as renormalizability allows for finite calculation at any order in
perturbation theory. Physicists started to actively look for neutral
currents which would be a great success for the electroweak theory.

The thrilling experimental discovery of these neutral currents happened
in 1973 at CERN in the Gargamelle detector [ 35 ] . This established the
electroweak theory as the correct theory describing the weak and
electromagnetic interactions in an unified gauge theory view, preserving
renormalizability and allowing for massive weak bosons. Glashow,
Weinberg and Salam were awarded the 1979 Nobel prize for the electroweak
model, ’t Hooft was awarded the 1999 Nobel prize for the proof of its
renormalizability.

The electroweak theory together with QCD describing strong interactions
is what is called the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics.

###### @xmath and @xmath bosons: the experimental success

The final paragraph of this short history of the SM is devoted to the
direct discovery of the massive @xmath and @xmath in 1983. Indeed after
the great success of the year 1973 where the weak neutral currents,
predicted by the electroweak theory, were discovered at CERN, the weak
bosons remained to be discovered.

The UA1 and UA2 experiment at the SPS proton–antiproton collider at
CERN, conducted by Van der Meer and Rubbia, did the great discovery in
1983 [ 36 , 37 ] . They were awareded the 1984 Nobel prize, an
unexpected fast acknowledgement from the Nobel committee.

We are arrived at the end of our path along the history of the SM. This
subsection does not pretend to cover all its aspects, sketching only
some landmarks. What remains to be done? As put in light above the
Brout–Englert–Higgs mechanism plays a key role in the formulation of the
SM. However the Higgs boson related to this mechanism has yet to be
found, despite nearly thirty years of intense research both at the CERN
and Fermilab colliders. This motivates not only this thesis, but also
the very exciting research program of current high energy colliders! We
are all waiting for decisive answers in the coming years…

#### 1.2 Gauge symmetries, quarks and leptons

Now that we have seen the major pages of the history of the Standard
Model (SM), we review its content. Most of this subsection is based on
Ref. [ 38 ] and the lecture notes of a master course on particle physics
and gauge theories [ 39 , 40 ] . As briefly discussed in the historical
part of this section, the key concept behing the SM is that of
symmetries. We will thus give the symmetry algebra of the SM that shapes
the interactions between the fundamental particles.

###### The particle content

Each interaction is described by a quantum field theory based on a Lie
algebra which describes the gauge symmetry of the interaction. The Lie
algebra of the SM is @xmath :

-   @xmath describes the strong interaction among the quarks which are
    the colored fermions of the theory. This is the QCD theory.

-   @xmath describes the electroweak interaction between the quarks and
    the leptons. @xmath is the hypercharge of the fermions that are
    charged under @xmath . This is the electroweak theory.

Each fermion is classified in irreducible representations of each
individual Lie algebra, that is according to its quantum numbers @xmath
which are respectively the color, the weak isospin and the hypercharge.
The electric charge is then given by the Gell–Mann–Nishijima relation
@xmath . The SM fermion part is organised in three generations, which
are three times a replication of the same structure: one charged lepton
and one neutrino on the one hand, two quarks on the other hand.

The weak interaction maximally violates the parity symmetry: @xmath Lie
algebra acts only on left–handed fermions. Apart from the neutrinos
which are only left–handed in the SM and massless ⁵ ⁵ 5 Experimentally
it has been proved that the neutrinos are indeed massive. The existence
of the right–handed neutrinos is then still an open question. , all
others fermions are both left and right–handed. Table 1 below gives the
fermionic content of the SM ⁶ ⁶ 6 The value of the @xmath and @xmath
–quark masses will be discussed in more details in section 6.2 . .

In addition to the fermionic content there are the gauge bosons
mediating the interactions and one scalar boson, the Higgs boson that we
have already seen in the brief history of the SM. Before the electroweak
symmetry breaking, we have in the electroweak sector:

-   The three @xmath weak bosons that are the generators of the @xmath
    gauge algebra.

-   The neutral @xmath boson that is the generator of the @xmath gauge
    algebra.

-   The scalar Higgs doublet @xmath .

We also have 8 gluons @xmath as generators of the non–broken @xmath
color symmetry algebra. After electroweak symmetry breaking the
electroweak bosons states mix and give two charged weak bosons @xmath ,
a neutral weak boson @xmath and the photon @xmath which remains
massless. We also retain one scalar degree of freedom: the Higgs boson.

###### The SM lagrangian

As stated in the historical subsection, in order to retain the gauge
symmetry of the SM all fields must remain massless. More precisely,
explicit mass terms for fermions in the form @xmath would not break the
@xmath gauge symmetry but would violate @xmath symmetry, as such a term
is indeed a product @xmath . One of the terms in the product does not
change under @xmath transformation, which thus means that the product is
not invariant. Morever the same argument applies for weak bosons
(sketched in a different way as we are dealing with bosons). How to
account for the mass of the weak bosons and of the fermions, which
manifestely exist according to experiments?

The solution within the SM is precisely the Brout–Englert–Higgs
mechanism that will be described in the next section: we add to the
theory a scalar doublet which will generate through spontaneous symmetry
breaking the masses of the weak bosons, and also of the fermions through
Yukawa interactions.

We will only write down the lagrangian of the unbroken electroweak
symmetry for one generation, as the two others are an exact mathematical
replica (apart from the Yukawa sector). The broken lagrangian will be
described in the following section when dealing with weak gauge bosons
masses. We use the notation @xmath , @xmath for the left doublets, and
we have @xmath , @xmath and @xmath for the right–handed electron, up and
down quarks. The Higgs doublet is @xmath .

We use @xmath for the generator of the @xmath algebra and the three
generators @xmath of the @xmath algebra are taken as the half of the
@xmath Pauli matrices

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

with the commutation relations between these generators given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the usual antisymmetric tensor. For the strong sector we
use the eight Gell–Mann @xmath @xmath matrices as the generators of
@xmath symmetry associated with the eight gluons @xmath , with

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath are the structure constants of the Lie algebra. We then
have the field strengths for the gauge bosons given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.5)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

@xmath and @xmath are, respectively, the coupling constants of @xmath
and @xmath gauge algebras. The non–abelian structure of the strong and
weak interaction leads to non–trivial interactions among respectively
the gluons and the weak bosons, with triple and quartic couplings.

In order to have a locally gauge invariant lagrangian we have to write a
covariant derivative for the fermions. The minimal coupling between the
fermionic matter fields and the gauge bosons, with @xmath as the @xmath
coupling constant, is defined as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the covariant derivative 1.6 it has to be understood that only the
relevant part is to be taken: @xmath and @xmath couplings are irrelevant
for the case of a right–handed electron for example.

The SM Lagrangian is then written in the following way:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (1.7)
                                         
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

@xmath is a potential term for the scalar field, and will be studied in
the following section. The Yukawa interactions in @xmath give rise to
the mass of the fermions coupled to the Higgs field through @xmath for
the electron (more generally the charged leptons), and @xmath for the 6
quarks. The diagonalization of the @xmath matrix gives the CKM matrix
which is then involved in the couplings between the weak bosons and the
quarks. We also remind the reader that the @xmath is a formal form
actually involving both @xmath and @xmath terms where @xmath in order to
give a mass to up–type quarks.

### 2 The Brout–Englert–Higgs mechanism

After the presentation of the lagrangian of the SM in the previous
section we now turn our attention to the electroweak symmetry breaking.
The first question to be answered is: why do we need the electroweak
symmetry breaking in the description of the SM? For example, as already
stated, we now through the experiment that weak bosons should be
massive, as the weak interaction is that of short–range; but explicit
mass terms are prohibited if we want to preserve gauge symmetry
principles.

This will be discussed in details in the following subsection. We will
then present the spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking using one
scalar weak doublet, which is known as the Brout–Englert–Higgs mechanism
[ 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ] . We will deduce the weak bosons masses and the
Higgs boson couplings to fermions and bosons.

#### 2.1 Why do we need the electroweak symmetry breaking?

##### 2.1.1 The unitarity puzzle

As presented in the historical part, the effective Fermi theory was the
first attempt to describe the weak interaction in a quantum framework.
The neutron and proton interactions were described in an effective
four–point vertex, which in the end results in a cross section which
grows with the center–of–mass energy @xmath . This means that the theory
at some point has lost unitarity and cannot make reliable predictions: a
reliable quantum theory should arrange for having the sum of the
probabilities of every possible event to be equal to one, hence
conserving the unitarity.

When taking into account the mass of the @xmath boson we restore
unitarity at the Fermi scale. Nevertheless we still face a potential
disaster at higher energy: if we study for example the scattering of two
@xmath bosons we obtain a growth of the cross section with higher
center–of–mass energy, still destroying unitarity beyond the Fermi
scale. We thus have to cure the theory in order to restore unitarity in
all processes, then preserving its prediction power and the ability to
calculate reliable quantities.

The crucial point that has been developed in 1973 in Refs. [ 41 , 42 ]
is that of the following: if we impose the SM (without the Higgs field
as introduced in standard textbooks by requiring spontaneous symmetry
breaking) to remain unitary at the Born level in perturbation theory we
end up precisely with two requirements:

1.  The fermion–bosons interactions should be that of Yang–Mills theory.

2.  The theory needs at least a scalar doublet whose couplings to
    fermions and bosons are precisely that of the Higgs mechanism type.
    The self–couplings are also that of the Higgs type.

This very important result should be interpretated as proving the
existence of something to restore unitarity in weak processes that is,
either the Higgs doublet and subsequently the Higgs boson itself, or
something which looks exactly like the Higgs doublet and reproducing its
properties . This second proposition is what should remain in mind when
dealing with electroweak symmetry breaking: the @xmath symmetry has to
be broken to restore unitarity, even if we do not think about the weak
bosons masses puzzle. Indeed, if the gauge symmetry were preserved we
would not have included new symmetry breking scalar degree of freedom,
hence not have had the precise type of fermion–scalar and boson-scalar
interactions that are those of gauge breaking type.

To demonstrate this intimate connection between the scalar degrees of
freedom and the unitarity requirement, we present the case of the @xmath
production through electron–positron annihilation. The four Feynman
diagrams are depicted in Fig. 1 .

Let us suppose for a while that the fourth Feynman diagram involving the
Higgs boson exchange does not exist. If we are interested in the
production of longitudinal @xmath bosons, as the electron are massive we
need to cancel the cross section divergence arising because the electron
can have an helicity distinct from that of its chirality. If this
problem might seem to be not so critical, the electron mass being small,
this is certainly not the case if we replace the electron by the top
quark, a process that should be described by the theory. This divergence
is then proportional to @xmath and has to be cancelled by a new
contribution also proportional to @xmath . To avoid some tedious
questions when using particles with spin higher than @xmath , this new
contribution should be of spin zero.

This two last conditions are precisely fullfilled with the Higgs boson
contribution of the fourth Feynman diagram that we now take into account
and that restores the unitarity of this process!

This very important result, leading to the conclusion that something
should be discovered at hadron colliders at the electroweak scale,
wether it is the SM Higgs boson or its beyond–the–SM collegues, or
anything else which looks like the Higgs boson (e.g. composite Higgs
boson, extra–dimensions mimick, etc.), has also been extended in Ref. [
43 ] for arbitrary scalar multiplets. We should then keep in mind the
intimate link between unitarity requirement and the existence of (a) new
scalar degree(s) of freedom in the electroweak theory.

##### 2.1.2 Masses and gauge invariance

So far we have addressed the formal problem of requiring that the theory
remains predictive and thus at least preserve unitarity in high energy
processes. The last subsubsection has shown that this precise
requirement of preserving unitarity leads to the existence of either the
Higgs mechanism (and the Higgs boson), or the existence of something
which looks like the Higgs boson.

We take here the other way around by looking at what the experiment
tells us. We want to use gauge symmetry formalism in order to describe
the fundamental interactions at the high energy scale as it has been
proved to be a very powerful tool in the description of quantum
electromagnetic processes. The problem that we have is that Nature gives
us massive weak bosons, the interaction being of short length scale; it
turns out that explicit mass terms are prohibited in the lagrangian as
to preserve gauge invariance.

If we do not have any mass terms nor take into account the scalar part
in the SM lagrangian 1.7 , this gauge transformations preserve the
lagrangian:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

It is of course understood that the @xmath gauge tranformation acts only
on the quark and gluons fields.

Let us suppose that we now add explicit mass terms in the lagrangian 1.7
(again we exclude at this stage the scalar part as we are interested in
proving that we need it, without explicit mass terms), taking as an
example the hypercharge boson @xmath (which is exactly like the case of
a massive photon). We write down its gauge transformation as:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

which does not preserve @xmath gauge invariance. This means that we
cannot account for the mass of the weak bosons while preserving gauge
invariance with explicit mass terms in the lagrangian.

We also have a similar problem when dealing with fermions. Indeed we
obviously observe a massive electron, not to mention the heavy quarks.
We would then include a mass term @xmath in the lagrangian. This does
not break @xmath nor @xmath , but if we rewrite this mass term using
chirality degrees of freedom we have:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

which manifestly violates @xmath gauge symmetry since @xmath is a member
of a doublet while @xmath is a member of a singlet.

Thus, the incorporation by hand of mass terms for gauge bosons and
fermions leads to a manifest breakdown of the local @xmath gauge
invariance. We then have at a first look either to give up the fact that
we do observe masses for weak bosons and for fermions, which of course
is unacceptable, or we have to give up the principle of (exact) gauge
symmetry.

The spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking is a solution which avoids
both of the problematic answers given above: we still preserve the gauge
symmetry of the theory, but the vacuum breaks the electroweak symmetry
and gives rise to massive gauge bosons and fermions in the spectrum. In
the following subsection we will sketch the Higgs mechanism which is the
simplest procedure to do so.

#### 2.2 The spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking

We have seen that we are bound to add something to the gauge content of
the SM in order to both preserve unitarity and give masses to the weak
bosons, which are known to be massive. The most simple solution is known
as the Brout–Englert–Higgs mechanism [ 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ] and will be
presented in this subsection. We will see how to obtain the weak bosons
masses, and then we will review the Higgs boson coupling to fermions and
bosons that will be used in the following sections when dealing with the
SM Higgs boson production and decay at the hadron colliders.

##### 2.2.1 Weak bosons masses and electroweak breaking

###### The Higgs mechanism

This subsubsection is built upon Refs. [ 44 ] and [ 45 ] . We start by
taking the full SM lagrangian 1.7 , that is not only the gauge and
fermion parts but also the scalar part. We thus add a new @xmath scalar
doublet to the usual content of the theory:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with @xmath hypercharge. @xmath is also a color singlet. We remind the
reader that the scalar part of the SM lagrangian 1.7 is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The vacuum expectation value of the Higgs doublet is given by the
minimum of @xmath . We first note that @xmath is required to have a
potential bounded from below, thus insuring a stable vacuum. We then
have the two situations depicted in Fig. 2 for a one dimensional scalar
field.

If @xmath we then have a positive potential everywhere, whose minimum is
@xmath : we have not achieved anything new.

We will then suppose that @xmath , which is the hypothesis building the
Brout–Englert–Higgs mechanism [ 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ] that we apply in the
SM. In that case we obtain a minimum

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the case of the @xmath doublet, the potential is depicted in Fig. 3
below.

The vacuum expectation value (vev) still preserves a @xmath symmetry,
but has broken the @xmath symmetry: we thus have a spontaneously
breaking of the original SM gauge algebra down to a residual @xmath
symmetry which, as seen later, is the electromagnetic @xmath gauge
algebra.

To make a physical interpretation of the lagrangian we will expand
@xmath around its minimum which will give us the physical degree of
freedom. The neutral component of the doublet field @xmath will develop
a vacuum expectation value

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

We have chosen this direction so as to preserve @xmath . We then write
the field @xmath in terms of four fields @xmath and @xmath around the
minimum, and at first order we have:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

The second expression is crucial: as the theory remains gauge invariant
we can always make a @xmath gauge transformation with the parameter
@xmath , which means that we chose a particular gauge, called the
unitary gauge or U–gauge:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

We have to expand the scalar part of the lagrangian 1.7 in this gauge,
we obtain:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We define the physical fields @xmath , @xmath and @xmath as:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

With this new basis we finally obtain the physical interpretation of the
scalar part of the lagrangian:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.9)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

The spontaneous breakdown of @xmath has achieved our goal of obtaining
masses for the weak bosons. They can be read in the second line of Eq.
2.9 as:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

not to mention the Higgs mass itself @xmath .

The photon @xmath remains massless as the remaining @xmath is unbroken
while the three weak bosons @xmath and @xmath are now massive. The three
degree of freedom @xmath of the original Higgs doublet, which are
Goldstone bosons, have been absorbed by the @xmath and @xmath bosons to
obtain their longitudinal components, which means that the number of
degree of freedom is still conserved when looking at the lagrangian
before and after the electroweak symmetry breaking. We are left with one
scalar degree of freedom: the Higgs boson.

The remaining lines of Eq. 2.9 give the couplings of the Higgs boson
@xmath with the gauge bosons, and also its trilinear and quartic
self–couplings.

If we recall the fermionic part of the SM lagrangian which also contains
Higgs field couplings to fermion, we can also generate the fermion
masses using @xmath and @xmath . Starting from

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have left out the CKM issue and only delt with the first
generation, again we expand the expression around the vev:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.12)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

We then have the fermion masses:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

and also the Higgs–fermion–fermion couplings @xmath . We thus have
generated the masses of both the weak vector bosons @xmath and the
fermions, while preserving the @xmath gauge symmetry, which is now
spontaneously broken or hidden, together with a preservation of both the
color @xmath and electromagnetic @xmath gauge symmetries. This
constitutes the Higgs mechanism applied to the Standard Model. The SM
refers actually to the gauge symmetries together with the Higgs
mechanism.

###### The fundamental parameters

We list in this small paragraph the main fundamental parameters of the
SM that will be used in the following sections.

1.   Weak coupling and the Fermi constant: The weak couplings in the
    lagrangian are @xmath and @xmath for the @xmath gauge algebra. This
    can be related to the Fermi constant @xmath GeV @xmath , by taking
    the low energy limit of the electroweak theory:

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (2.14)
      -- -------- -- --------

    using the @xmath mass given in Eq. 2.10 , we have the value of the
    vev

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (2.15)
      -- -------- -- --------

2.   The Weinberg angle: we can relate the @xmath and @xmath bosons
    masses through what is called the Weinberg angle @xmath :

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      
         @xmath      (2.16)
      -- -------- -- --------

    This leads to

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (2.17)
      -- -------- -- --------

    and this value is hardly changed when taking into account radiative
    corrections, a statement which can be related to a global @xmath
    custodial symmetry in the SM. This imposes constraints on any theory
    that goes beyond the SM.

3.   Strong and electromagnetic constants: the electromagnetic coupling
    constant is related to the @xmath coupling constants through @xmath
    . We have at the scale @xmath :

      -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.18)
      -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

    The value of the strong coupling constant will be particularly
    important when dealing with Higgs boson production and decay at
    hadron colliders; this will be discussed in more details in the
    following part II .

4.  @xmath and @xmath masses: the current measured values of the @xmath
    and @xmath masses are

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (2.19)
      -- -------- -- --------

##### 2.2.2 SM Higgs boson couplings

We finish this presentation of the SM by giving the Higgs couplings to
gauge bosons and fermions in a compact form. This couplings will play a
crucial role in the following parts as they dictate the dynamics of the
SM Higgs boson in production and decays.

The couplings of the Higgs boson @xmath with the gauge bosons as well as
its trilinear and quartic self–couplings can be read in Eq. 2.9 , while
the SM Higgs boson coupling to fermions can be read in Eq. 2.12 . These
tree–level couplings are depicted in Fig. 4 below.

When taking into account the number of identical particles in the
vertex, this gives

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath                        (2.20)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

There are two additionnal couplings which are of utmost importance for
the study of the Higgs boson, either within or beyond the SM. Indeed,
even if the Higgs is not charged nor colored, it may have a coupling to
the photon and the gluons at the one–loop level, as shown in Fig. 5 .
This couplings come through a fermionic triangular loop which carries
the absent quantum number of the Higgs boson.

The gluon–gluon–Higgs coupling will play a major role in the production
of the Higgs boson at hadron colliders. Now that we have ended
describing the Standard Model and the Higgs mechanism, we are ready to
study the SM Higgs production and decay at the two hadron colliders in
activity.

## Part II SM Higgs production and decay at hadron colliders

### 3 Where can the SM Higgs boson be hiding?

The section 2 was devoted to the Higgs mechanism itself and its remnant
particle, the Higgs boson. This key particle, predicted by the Standard
Model and at the core of the electroweak symmetry breaking, has been yet
to be discovered for nearly 40 years. Large particle physics experiments
have promoted its search as prominent, such as in the LEP era [ 46 ] and
at the Tevatron collider. It is also one of the key searches at the
newest Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.

Before starting to study the Higgs boson production at the two current
hadronic colliders and then its decay, we will review the current
theoretical and experimental bounds on its mass which is not predicted
by the Standard Model.

#### 3.1 Theoretical bounds on the Higgs mass

The Higgs boson mass is not predicted by the Standard Model. Hence the
only prediction that can be made is on the range of validity for @xmath
as to be sure that the Standard Model is still a valid and consistent
theory. The theoretical bounds on the Higgs mass are precisely derived
on these requirements: we probe the mass range in which the SM does not
break down and where perturbation theory is still applicable, before new
phenomena occur. These limits include constraints from the unitarity
required in scattering amplitudes, the perturbativity of the Higgs
self–coupling and considerations about the stability of the vacuum of
the theory. We summarize and combine all the limits in the last
subsubsection.

##### 3.1.1 Unitarity constraint

The SM is embedded within the framework of quantum field theory. As for
any consistent quantum theory, where the description is probabilistic in
the sense that any physical observable has a probability to be measured
by an observer, the total probability is conserved and equal to the
unity. In the context of the scattering amplitudes within the SM, it
means that we require that the @xmath –matrix, which encodes all the
necessary information between the initial and final states, is unitary.
We thus want that the SM to be unitary in that sense, which will
translate into an upper bound for the SM Higgs boson mass.

It was actually one of the main arguments to abandon the Fermi theory of
the weak interaction, together with the requirement of accomodate within
a gauge theory the fact that experimentally the weak bosons are to have
a mass. To take an example the weak process @xmath is proportional to
the Mandelstam variable @xmath , which then violates unitarity at a
certain point as we should instead have @xmath . If we go further the
unitarity constraint applied to all SM processes does even lead to the
requirement of the Higgs field itself, as presented in section 2.1.1 ⁷ ⁷
7 To be more rigourous this leads to the requirement of a new scalar
degree of freedom which exactly looks like the Higgs field of the SM.
This does not mean that this new degree of freedom is elementary and it
may well be a strongly coupled composite bound state, as proposed in
many Higgsless theories [ 47 , 48 ] . . In some sense, we can think
about the SM as the theory which cures the unitarity problem at the
Fermi scale @xmath GeV.

However there is still some potential unitarity concern in the SM, at
much higher energies than the Fermi scale, in particular if it is
believed that the SM is valid up to the Planck scale ⁸ ⁸ 8 That is not
the current belief of the community, though. If SM were indeed valid up
to the Planck scale we would stop working on particle physics! That
would be a shame for young particle physicists and we hope that Nature
does not trick us with that…. . We take as an example the @xmath
scattering, looking in particular at the longitudinal component @xmath
scattering. This scattering is (one of) the focus point of the
spontaneously electroweak symmetry breaking as the @xmath is one of the
degrees of freedom of the unbroken Higgs field. The situation is that of
the Fermi theory: the @xmath interaction grows with the momenta of the
ingoing particles, which then may lead to a violation of the unitarity
requirement. Considering that at high center–of–mass energies we can
work directly with the corresponding Goldstone bosons for the scattering
of the longitudinal component, we obtain very easily

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath are the Mandelstam variables (the center–of–mass energy
@xmath is the square of the sum of the momenta of the initial or final
states, while @xmath is the square of the difference between the momenta
of one initial and one final state).

In order to study the unitarity of this amplitude we use the partial
wave decomposition of the scalar amplitude on the Legendre polynomials
basis:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath being the partial waves along the angular momentum @xmath
and @xmath the scattering angle in the center–of-mass frame. We recall
the reader that the Legendre polynomials is an orthogonal basis of the
vector space @xmath . In particular we have the orthonormal condition

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the Kronecker symbol. Since for a @xmath process, the
cross section is given by @xmath with d @xmath d @xmath , the total
cross section is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.4)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

We now use the optical theorem which relates the imaginary part of the
amplitude taken on the beam line @xmath and the total cross section
@xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

This leads to the unitary conditions [ 49 , 50 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.6)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

We thus obtain the equation of a circle of radius @xmath and center
@xmath in the plane @xmath . The real part lies between @xmath and
@xmath , we obtain the unitarity condition which follows:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

The kinematics of the process gives @xmath . If we use the
orthonormality relation of the Legendre polynomials and knowing that
@xmath we easily obtain the @xmath partial wave @xmath . Using the
@xmath variable this transforms in

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

We then obtain for the @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

If we now assume that the Higgs boson mass to be much smaller than
@xmath and then use the unitary condition 3.7 we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

The same analysis has to be done for any channel of the theory: @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , etc. The condition obtained in Eq.
3.10 is formally valid only at tree–level, and since the Higgs boson
self–coupling becomes strong for large Higgs masses, @xmath , the
argument could be destroyed if radiative corrections are taken into
account. This is then only a perturbative tree–level unitarity limit.
The complete perturbative unitarity argument should then be given within
the context of a perturbative expansion analysis and assuring that the
SM remains a perturbative theory where the radiative corrections are not
too large. Taking this into account and with all the channel in the
theory, the unitarity constraint is (incidentally!) still the one given
by Eq. 3.10 [ 51 , 52 , 53 ] .

We could adopt a different point of view and look the other way around
where @xmath is taken very large, and we would then obtain a bound on
the possible compatible @xmath energies [ 54 ] . We take the example of
the @xmath channel. We take the limit @xmath in Eq. 3.9 where the number
3 is replaced by the number 2, and then apply the unitarity condition
3.7 to obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

Considering all the possible channels this reduces to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore we face two possibilities: either some new physics should
manifest at the TeV scale range if the Higgs boson is very massive (or
not existing at all), or the unitarity breakdown is canceled by large
high–order terms which signal the failure of perturbation theory and the
loss of the predictive power of the SM. The last possibility is of
course a nightmare that we would avoid, and then we have two final
reasonable conclusions:

1.  the SM Higgs boson exists and its mass should be bounded, @xmath
    GeV, in order to retain unitarity.

2.  the SM Higgs boson is very massive or does not exist: then new
    physics effects are to emerge at the TeV scale.

##### 3.1.2 Constraint from the perturbativity of the self–Higgs
coupling

Even if we forget about the unitarity issue, the requirement of having a
perturbative theory in particular with processes involving the Higgs
self–coupling will induce an upper bound on the Higgs boson mass. Indeed
it is known that for large values of the Higgs boson mass the
perturbation theory is lost. If we take the SM Higgs decay into massive
gauge bosons, we obtain (see Ref. [ 45 ] ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath . We recall that we have @xmath . Thus if we require that
the perturbativity of the calculation remains, that is each term in the
expansion is smaller that its predecessor, we can derive an upper bound
on the Higgs boson mass. Indeed if we have @xmath TeV the 1–loop term is
of order 1, @xmath , breaking the perturbativity. We can reduce this
bound even more with the limit @xmath where the 1–loop term is of order
the 2–loop term, we then have @xmath GeV in this limit. Thus we have to
impose @xmath TeV to retain the perturbativity of the expansion.

The jeopardy of perturbation theory at large Higgs masses can also be
seen in the scattering of longitudinal gauge bosons from which were
derived above the upper bound on @xmath using perturbative unitarity
argument. In the case of the @xmath scattering, the radiative
corrections have been calculated at one and two loops in Refs. [ 55 , 56
, 57 , 58 ] . The logarithmic scale dependence found in these
corrections can be absorbed in a running @xmath coupling through
Renormalization Group analysis and we find (see Ref. [ 45 ] ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here, the coefficients of the corrections are much larger than in Higgs
decays and in fact, the one–loop correction become of order unity
already for @xmath values close to 3, that transforms into @xmath GeV.

The perturbativity of the self–Higgs coupling in the end implies that
@xmath GeV in order to keep a calculable pertubative theory. We then
obtain a bound that is very close to that obtained using the unitarity
argument.

##### 3.1.3 Triviality constraint

The triviality constraint is closely related to the vacuum stability
that is the next constraint that will be discussed. An interacting
theory is said to be trivial when the coupling is indeed null, which
means that it is actually a non–interacting theory. The scalar sector of
the SM is a @xmath –theory, and for these theories to remain
perturbative at all scales it is required that the theory is trivial:
@xmath , and thus the Higgs boson is massless [ 59 , 60 , 61 , 62 , 63 ,
64 , 65 , 49 , 50 ] .

We will take another point of view, and look at the Renormalization
Group Equation (RGE) for the quartic Higgs coupling @xmath and require
that it remains finite and the theory perturbative. It will define a
range for the scale where the SM is valid and thus we will obtain an
upper bound for the Higgs mass. Fig. 6 shows the tree–level Higgs
self–coupling together with its one–loop corrections. These contribute
to the @xmath –function for the @xmath –coupling; as we are interested
in the high @xmath regime the leading terms will only deal with the
Higgs–Higgs couplings. In this limit the RGE equation is written at the
one–loop order as [ 66 , 67 , 68 , 69 , 70 , 71 , 72 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

When choosing the electroweak symmetry breaking scale @xmath as the
reference scale we then obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

The triviality is recovered at small energy scale @xmath where @xmath .
The other limit will give us the bound that we are looking for. Indeed
at a certain point we see that @xmath becomes infinite if we increase
the energy scale @xmath . We thus reach a Landau pole, at the scale

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

If we would like that the scale @xmath be large, the Higgs mass should
be small. If we assume the SM to be valid up to the Planck scale and
then take @xmath GeV this requires a light Higgs boson mass @xmath GeV.
If we take a small cut–off @xmath GeV, the Higgs boson can be heavier,
@xmath GeV. In particular, if the cut–off is set at the Higgs boson mass
itself, @xmath , this implies that @xmath . Nevertheless we should bear
in mind that all the calculations presented so far use the perturbation
theory and if @xmath becomes too large the calculation becomes
non–consistent. According to Ref. [ 45 ] , simulations of gauge theories
on the lattice save the argument as the rigorous bound that is obtained
is @xmath GeV [ 73 , 74 ] , in a good agreement with the perturbative
results obtained in this paragraph.

##### 3.1.4 Stability requirement and lower bound on Higgs mass

To obtain a lower bound on the Higgs mass we retain in the RGE equation
3.15 all the terms at the one–loop order, in particular the fermionic
corrections depicted in Fig. 6 as the Higgs boson couplings is
proportionnal to the fermion masses. The one–loop RGE equation for the
Higgs self–coupling 3.15 becomes, including all weak and fermion masses:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are respectively the hypercharge and weak coupling
constants. The triviality bounds are marginally affected, but in an
important way as the scale of physics beyond the SM will now depend on
the precise value of the top quark mass, which explains why the top
sector is of such great importance in the quest for new physics. The
large impact of the additional fermionic and bosonic contributions to
the Higgs self–coupling @xmath –function is for very small values of
@xmath . For @xmath , the RGE can be approximated by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

This translates into the solution

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

The top quark contribution becomes dominant for @xmath and indeed drives
the self–coupling to negative values, which then imply that the vacuum
is not stable anymore. If we want to have a bounded scalar potential and
thus a vacuum we should keep @xmath [ 75 , 76 , 77 , 78 , 79 ] and then
the Higgs boson mass should have the lower bound

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

Thus we have a lower bound limit dependent on the cut–off @xmath that is
the appearance of the new physics. We thus obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.22)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

##### 3.1.5 Combination of the theoretical bounds

As stated in Ref. [ 45 ] (nearly) all the bounds presented up until now
were derived in a perturbative approach at the one–loop level at most.
The use of the most advanced results helps to improve the limits [ 79 ,
80 , 81 , 82 ] .

In particular the @xmath functions of all SM couplings have been
calculated up to two loops and can then be included in the analysis of
the Higgs boson mass. From Ref. [ 45 ] we extract for the @xmath Higgs
self–coupling

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

At the two–loop level the @xmath coupling can reach an ultraviolet fixed
point where @xmath . This means that the value of the cut–off scale can
be lower that obtained above. The stability bound is again obtained by
the requirement that @xmath and we use a two–loop @xmath function
retaining all the Higgs, weak boson and fermion corrections, including
matching conditions, that is the precise relation between the physical
masses of the gauge bosons and the top quark and their corresponding
couplings.

We obtain [ 82 ] the Roman plot shown in Fig. 7 for the stability and
triviality bounds on the Higgs boson mass. The graph displays the
allowed values for the Higgs boson mass in function of the scale @xmath
for new physics effects. The upper band is the triviality limit and the
lower band is the stability limit. These are bands instead of lines in
order to take into account some theory and experimental uncertainties in
the determination (e.g. scale dependence, imput top quark mass, etc.).

In the end the Higgs boson mass is allowed to be in the range

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

when new physics is to arise at the TeV scale, taking also into account
the unitarity constraint. If we require that the SM be valid up to the
Grand Unification scale, @xmath GeV, the Higgs boson mass should lie in
the range

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 3.2 Experimental bounds on the Higgs mass

The experimental quest for the evidence of the SM Higgs boson has
started more than twenty years ago, at the CERN Large Electron Positron
(LEP) collider. As the Higgs boson has sizeable contributions to
radiative corrections to many processes in the SM, its existence can be
probed through its effects on electroweak observables. Hence we can
obtain indirect constraints on its mass. We will also present of course
the constraints obtained with its direct search both at the LEP collider
and the Fermilab Tevatron collider. We note that the last constraint,
obtained at the Tevatron, will be challenged in the following chapters
of this thesis.

##### 3.2.1 Indirect searches through precision data

The SM has been tested in many experiments for decades and the results
have reached a very high precision. It then imposes stringent conditions
on new physics phenomena as well as on the Higgs boson itself, the only
yet unknown SM particle to be discovered.

We will summarize the electroweak precision data used to constraint
indirectly the SM Higgs boson mass, classified by the different
experiments:

1.   LEP1 searches : LEP1 was the first era of running for the LEP
    collider, when the designed center–of–mass energy was 110 GeV (the
    actual energy used was 45.6 GeV per beam near the @xmath peak). This
    has given us much information on the @xmath lineshape: the @xmath
    mass, the total @xmath width @xmath , the peak hadronic cross
    section @xmath , the ratio @xmath between the @xmath partial decay
    width into leptons, charm and bottom quarks, and the total hadronic
    @xmath decay width, the forward–backward asymmetries @xmath for
    leptons and heavy @xmath quarks, the @xmath polarization asymmetry
    @xmath , etc.

2.   LEP2 searches : LEP2 was the second step for the LEP collider when
    the designed energy did reach 209 GeV center–of–mass energy in 2000,
    the year of the end of the collider operations. It has given
    valuable information on the @xmath boson: its mass @xmath , the
    total decay width @xmath , again the different asymmetries that are
    used to measure @xmath through the lepton channel, the hadronic
    contribution @xmath to the value of @xmath , etc. As discussed in
    the next subsubsection the Higgs boson was also hunted directly at
    LEP2.

3.   SLC searches : The Stanford Linear Collider (SLC) experiments in
    the beginning of the nineties have given unique results at the high
    precision level in electroweak physics thanks to its very polarized
    beams. The longitudinal polarization asymmetry @xmath which has been
    measured at the SLC thus gives the best individual measurement of
    @xmath . It has also measured the left–right forward–backward
    asymmetries for the heavy @xmath quarks, @xmath .

4.   Tevatron searches : The Fermilab Tevatron collider has started to
    operate in 1987 and will end running in the end of 2011. It has
    given precise measurements of the @xmath mass, the total decay width
    @xmath and in particular of the top quark mass @xmath , which were
    discovered at the Tevatron in 1995. Being a proton–antiproton
    collider it is also a good place to measure asymmetries. Its most
    important experimental programm is the search for the Higgs boson,
    and as discussed later it has given direct constraints on its mass.

5.  In addition there are high–precision measurements at low energies,
    for example the @xmath – and @xmath –nucleon deep–inelastic
    scattering cross sections, from which we can extract a determination
    of @xmath through the measure of the @xmath couplings to fermions,
    both the right–handed and the left–handed.

The comparison with the SM calculation of all these precision data is
displayed in Fig. 8 which has been taken from LEP ElectroWeak Working
Group webpage. The theoretical predictions are in a very good agreement
with the data, apart from a tension in the measure of the
forward–backward asymmetry for the @xmath –quark which is nearly 3
@xmath away from the SM value.

When combining all these precision data measurements, stringent
constraints on SM the Higgs boson mass can be obtained. When one
performs a fit on all the data, the @xmath of the fit displayed in Fig.
9 is obtained, depending on the Higgs boson mass.

On the left of the plot the area depicted in yellow (shaded), close to
the minimum value of the fit, is the excluded limit by the LEP2
experiments as discussed just below. The small yellow (shaded) band on
the right of the plot displays the limits set by the Tevatron run II
experiments, again discussed later on. The fitted SM Higgs boson mass is
then

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the 95%CL upper bound is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

This last limit can be a bit relaxed is the direct search limits at the
LEP and the Tevatron colliders are taken into account in the fit,
leading to @xmath GeV at 95%CL. The data thus strongly disfavour a very
heavy SM Higgs boson @xmath GeV which anyway is (nearly) outside the
theoretical bounds presented above.

It should be worth mentioning that the SM fit is not as good because of
the nearly 3 @xmath deviation of the forward–backward asymmetry of the
@xmath –quark @xmath . Nevertheless if this quantity were removed from
the fit, the obtained central value for the Higgs boson mass together
with the uncertainties would fall below the direct search limit,
increasing the tension between the central value from the EW fit and the
bounds obtained by the direct searches.

##### 3.2.2 Direct searches at the LEP collider

Direct searches of the SM Higgs boson started at the LEP collider in the
LEP1 era, but the interesting results have been obtained during the LEP2
era when @xmath GeV. The dominant production channel is the
Higgs–strahlung @xmath , see Refs. [ 83 , 84 , 85 , 86 , 87 , 88 , 89 ]
. The search has been conducted in several final states topologies:

1.   Final state @xmath : this final state is obtained with @xmath
    together with @xmath .

2.   Final state @xmath : with @xmath this is obtained with the same SM
    Higgs decay as above but with a leptonic @xmath decay @xmath .

3.   Final state @xmath : this topology is obtained through two
    different channels, @xmath and @xmath as the two Higgs decay channel
    are sizeable, see section 6 .

Even if there were tantalizing results in the end of year 2000 of the
observation of a SM Higgs boson around 115 GeV, the excess of @xmath
(after a re–evaluation as the first claimed observation was of @xmath
evidence) was not significant enough to claim a discovery [ 46 ] . The
combination of the results from the OPAL, L3, DELPHI and ALEPH
experiments at LEP has set an exclusion limit

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is displayed in Fig. 10 , which shows the statistical CL @xmath for
the signal plus background hypothesis as a function of the Higgs boson
mass. If the CL @xmath is below 0.05 the Higgs boson mass is excluded.
The expected exclusion is found to be @xmath GeV, the discrepency with
the observed exclusion being due to the excess discussed above.

It is worth mentioning that this direct search limit is rather robust as
it has been obtained in pure electroweak processes (at LO). In
particular the theoretical uncertainties on the predicted cross section
times branching ratios used for the comparison with the data are very
small; this has to be compared with the direct search limit discussed in
the following at the Tevatron collider which is a hadron collider.

##### 3.2.3 Direct searches at the Tevatron collider

The direct search for the SM Higgs boson at the Fermilab Tevatron
collider is its major experimental program and started more than a
decade ago. The production channel will be discussed in details in the
next section, but we can already mention briefly that there are two
dominant channels, the Higgs–strahlung processes @xmath with @xmath for
low Higgs mass searches @xmath GeV, and the gluon–gluon fusion channel
@xmath for high Higgs mass searches @xmath GeV. The most important decay
channels used at the Tevatron are the hadronic @xmath decay for low
Higgs mass searches and the bosonic @xmath for high Higgs mass searches.
Again, this will be discussed in details in the following, see section
6.1 .

The Tevatron has collected enough luminosity to be sensitive to Higgs
signal for @xmath GeV, but has not yet seen the elusive particle. For
the first time since the LEP experiments it was able to produce a new
exclusion limit in the year 2008 [ 90 ] which then was extended in the
next years [ 91 , 92 ] to reach the current exclusion limit [ 93 ] at
95%CL:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is displayed in Fig. 11 where the ratio between the 95%CL exclusion
limit on the Higgs cross section and the SM prediction is shown as a
function of the SM Higgs boson mass. When the ratio falls below the
unity the SM Higgs boson mass in excluded.

We remind the reader that this impressive result has been obtain at a
hadron collider. Contrary to the result 3.28 obtained at the LEP
collider, which is rather robust and theoretically well behaved, the
exclusion limit at the Tevatron is based upon a comparison between data
and SM prediction at a hadron collider, which are well known to be
plagued with various theoretical uncertainties as discussed in this
thesis. We will see that these limits are put into question, see Refs. [
94 , 95 ] , and that will be discussed in particular in section 6.5 .

### 4 Higgs production at the Tevatron

The Fermilab Tevatron collider has started its operation back in 1987
and has been the home of major particle physics discoveries, e.g. the
discovery of the top quark in 1995 which leads to a Nobel prize. The
Higgs search program is currently one of the most important research
plan for the collider. In this context, the CDF and D0 experiments at
the Tevatron have collected enough data to be sensitive to the Standard
Model Higgs boson. The two collaborations recently performed a combined
analysis on the search for this particle and excluded at the 95%
confidence level the possibility of a Higgs boson in the mass range
between 158 and 173 GeV [ 90 , 91 , 92 , 93 ] (see section 3.2 ). We are
thus entering a new era in the quest of the Higgs particle as this is
the first time that the mass range excluded by the Large
Electron–Positron (LEP) collaborations in the late 1990s, @xmath GeV [
46 ] , is extended.

Although current hadronic colliders have a center–of–mass energy that is
greater than the LEP energy, which is good to produce new physics
events, QCD interactions are dominant and plague the theoretical
prediction with various sources of uncertainties in contrast with the
predictions obtained at LEP where the production cross sections were
mainly sensitive to (small) electroweak effects which are well under
control. Among these are the contributions of yet uncalculated higher
order corrections which can be important as the strong coupling constant
@xmath is rather large; the errors due to the folding of the partonic
cross sections with the parton distribution functions (PDFs) to obtain
the production rates at the hadronic level; and the errors on some
important input parameters such as @xmath . An accurate calculation of
the estimation of these uncertainties is then mandatory in order to have
a complete theoretical prediction for the production rates and
eventually the production cross section times branching ratio
prediction. It would allow for a consistent comparison with the
experimental data available at the Tevatron which are described in term
of exclusion bounds ⁹ ⁹ 9 An example of such a situation is the @xmath
production cross section that has been measured at the Tevatron (and
elsewhere) and which was a factor of two to three larger than the
theoretical prediction, before higher order effects and various
uncertainties were included [ 96 ] . .

At the Tevatron, only two production channels are important for the
Standard Model Higgs boson ¹⁰ ¹⁰ 10 The CDF/D0 exclusion limits [ 90 ,
92 ] have been obtained by considering a large variety of Higgs
production and decay channels (36 and 54 exclusive final states for,
respectively, the CDF and D0 collaborations) and combining them using
artificial neural network techniques. However, as will be seen later,
only a few channels play a significant role in practice. . In the
moderate to high mass range, 140 GeV @xmath GeV, the Higgs boson decays
dominantly into @xmath boson pairs (with one @xmath state being possibly
off mass–shell) [ 97 , 98 ] and the main production channel is the
gluon–gluon fusion mechanism @xmath [ 99 ] which proceeds through heavy
(mainly top and, to a lesser extent, bottom) quark triangular loops. The
Higgs particle is then detected through the leptonic decays of the
@xmath bosons, @xmath with @xmath , which exhibits different properties
than the @xmath plus missing energy continuum background [ 100 ] .

It is well known that the @xmath production process is subject to
extremely large QCD radiative corrections [ 101 , 102 , 103 , 104 , 105
, 106 , 107 , 108 , 109 , 110 , 111 , 112 ] . In contrast, the
electroweak radiative corrections are much smaller, being at the level
of a few percent [ 113 , 114 , 115 , 116 , 117 , 118 ] as in the case of
Higgs production at the LEP collider. For the corrections due to the
strong interactions, the @xmath –factor defined as the ratio of the
higher order (HO) to the lowest order (LO) cross sections, consistently
evaluated with the @xmath value and the PDF sets at the chosen order,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

is about a factor of two at next-to-leading order (NLO) [ 101 , 102 ,
103 , 104 , 105 ] and about a factor of three at the
next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) [ 107 , 108 , 109 ] . In fact, this
exceptionally large @xmath –factor is what allows a sensitivity on the
Higgs boson at the Tevatron with the presently collected data.
Nevertheless, the @xmath --factor is so large that one may question the
reliability of the perturbative series, despite of the fact that there
seems to be kind of a convergence of the series as the NNLO correction
is smaller than the NLO correction ¹¹ ¹¹ 11 At LHC energies, the problem
of the convergence of the perturbative series is less severe as the QCD
@xmath –factor is only @xmath at NLO and @xmath at NNLO in the relevant
Higgs mass range. .

In the low mass range, @xmath GeV, the main Higgs decay channel is
@xmath [ 97 ] and the @xmath fusion mechanism cannot be used anymore as
the @xmath signal is swamped by the huge QCD jet background. The Higgs
particle has then to be detected through its associated production with
a @xmath boson @xmath [ 119 ] which leads to cleaner @xmath final states
[ 120 ] . Additional topologies that can also be considered in this
context are @xmath with @xmath or the twin production process @xmath
with the subsequent decays @xmath and @xmath or @xmath . Other
production/decay channels are expected to lead to very low rates and/or
to be affected with too large QCD backgrounds.

At the Tevatron, the Higgs–strahlung processes @xmath with @xmath
receive only moderate higher order corrections: the QCD corrections
increase the cross sections by about 40% at NLO [ 121 , 122 , 123 , 124
, 125 ] and 10% at NNLO [ 126 ] , while the impact of the one–loop
electroweak corrections is small, leading to a @xmath decrease of the
cross sections [ 127 ] . Thus, in contrast to the gluon–gluon fusion
process, the production cross sections in the Higgs–strahlung processes
should be well under control. The purpose of this section is to study
the Higgs boson production at the Tevatron in these two main search
channels, including all relevant higher order QCD and electroweak
corrections, using the latest MSTW 2008 set of PDFs [ 128 ] ¹² ¹² 12 The
PDFs are available in Ref. [ 129 ] . and comparing with other PDFs set
available on the market. The calculation has been performed in various
recent analyses [ 111 , 118 ] for the gluon–gluon fusion process and
CDF/D0 collaborations for example used their normalized cross sections
to produce the Higgs mass 95% CL limits [ 90 , 92 ] in their combined
analysis. The results were published in [ 94 ] and were the first update
for the Higgs–strahlung production channels @xmath with the newest PDFs
available on the market. The Tevatron analyses before July 2010 used the
normalised cross sections available in Refs. [ 130 , 131 ] which make
use of the old MRST2002 set of PDFs [ 132 ] , a parametrisation that was
approximate as it did not include the full set of evolved PDFs at NNLO.
For completeness, an update of the cross sections for the two other
single Higgs production channels at hadron colliders will also be
presented briefly: the weak boson fusion @xmath [ 85 , 133 , 134 , 135 ,
136 , 137 ] and the associated production with top quark pairs @xmath [
138 , 139 , 140 , 141 , 142 , 143 , 144 ] . These channels play only a
minor role at the Tevatron but have also been included in the CDF/D0
analysis [ 90 , 92 ] .

The study of the Higgs boson production will also include a
comprehensive investigation of all possible sources of uncertainties
mentioned earlier that have a significant impact on the central
prediction for the two main search channels. We will first discuss the
choice of the central renormalization scale @xmath and factorization
scale @xmath in the gluon–gluon fusion mechanism and explain why some
choices have been made about the order of calculation. We will then
begin the study of the uncertainties with the analysis of the unknown
higher order effects, which are usually estimated by exploring the cross
sections dependence on the renormalization scale @xmath and the
factorization scale @xmath . In most recent analyses, the two scales are
varied within a factor of two from a median scale which is considered as
the most natural one. We show that this choice slightly underestimates
the higher order effects and we use a criterion that allows a more
reasonable estimate of the latter: the range of variation of the two
scales @xmath and @xmath should be the one which allows the uncertainty
band of the LO/NLO cross section to match the central value of the cross
section at the highest calculated order. In the case of @xmath , for the
uncertainty band of the LO cross section to reach the central result of
the NNLO cross section, a variation of @xmath and @xmath within a factor
of @xmath from the central value @xmath is required; this choice of
central scale will also be discussed. When the scales are varied within
the latter range, one obtains an uncertainty on the NNLO cross section
of @xmath , which is slightly larger than what is usually assumed in
inclusive calculation. We will see that we obtain result that is
comparable with what is used in current Tevatron combined analysis and
which comes from 0,1,2 jets bin analysis [ 112 ] .

We then discuss the errors resulting from the folding of the partonic
cross sections with the parton densities, considering not only the
recent MSTW set of PDFs as in Refs. [ 111 , 112 , 118 ] , but also two
other PDF sets that are available in the literature: CTEQ [ 145 ] ¹³ ¹³
13 The PDFs are available in Ref. [ 146 ] . and ABKM [ 147 ] ¹⁴ ¹⁴ 14
The PDFs are available in Ref. [ 148 ] . . We will also make a
comprehensive comparison of all the NNLO available PDFs set on the
market: apart from MSTW and ABKM we will also consider HERAPDF [ 149 ]
and JR09 [ 150 ] . In the case of the cross section for the @xmath
process at the Tevatron, we find that while the PDF uncertainties
evaluated within the same scheme are moderate, as also shown in Refs. [
111 , 112 , 118 ] , the central values of the cross sections obtained
using the three schemes can be widely different. We show that it is only
when the experimental as well as the theoretical errors on the strong
coupling constant @xmath are accounted for that one obtains results that
are consistent when using the MSTW/CTEQ and ABKM schemes. As a result,
the sum of the PDF+ @xmath and @xmath uncertainties, that we evaluate
using a set–up recently proposed by the MSTW collaboration to determine
simultaneously the errors due to the PDFs and to @xmath , is estimated
to be at least a factor of two larger than what was generally assumed in
earlier analyses before the publication of Ref. [ 94 ] . We will also
show that the error we obtain is actually comparable to what should be
taken when using the PDF4LHC recommendation [ 151 ] .

Finally, a third source of potential errors is considered in the @xmath
fusion mechanism: the one resulting from the use of an effective field
theory approach, in which the loop particle masses are assumed to be
much larger than the Higgs boson mass, to evaluate the NNLO
contributions. While this error is very small in the case of the
top–quark contribution at the Tevatron, it is at the percent level in
the case of the @xmath –quark loop contribution at NNLO QCD where the
limit @xmath cannot be applied and where the @xmath –loop is indeed
totally absent as there are no @xmath –loop NNLO calculation available
up until now. This is also the case of the three–loop mixed
QCD–electroweak radiative corrections that have obtained in the
effective limit @xmath , which lead to a few percent uncertainty. In
addition, an uncertainty of about 1% originates from the freedom in the
choice of the input @xmath –quark mass in the @xmath amplitude. The
total uncertainty in this context is thus not negligible and amounts to
a few percent.

We then address the important issue of how to combine the theoretical
errors originating from these different sources. Since using the usually
adopted procedures of adding these errors either in quadrature, as is
done by the experimental collaborations for instance, or linearly as is
generally the case for theoretical errors, lead to either an
underestimate or to an overestimate of the total error, we propose a
procedure that seems to be more adequate. One first determines the
maximal and minimal values of the cross sections obtained from the
variation of the renormalization and factorization scales, and then
estimate directly on these extrema cross sections the combined
uncertainties due to the PDFs and to the experimental and theoretical
errors on @xmath . The other smaller theoretical uncertainties, such as
those coming from the use of the effective approach in @xmath , can be
then added linearly to this scale, PDF and @xmath combined error.

We will in the end show that the total theoretical error that we obtain
is nearly twice the one often quoted in the literature and used for the
Tevatron analyses. In particular, in the case of the most sensitive
Higgs production channel at the Tevatron, @xmath , the overall
uncertainty on the NNLO total cross section is found to be of the order
of @xmath . This is significantly larger than the uncertainty of @xmath
assumed by the CDF/D0 combined Higgs search analysis. As a result, we
believe that the exclusion range given by the Tevatron experiments for
the Higgs mass in the Standard Model, 158 GeV @xmath GeV, should be
discussed in the light of these results and that will be discussed in
section 6.5 .

#### 4.1 The main production channels

We present the procedure used to obtain the central or “best” values of
the total cross sections for SM Higgs production at the Tevatron. We
recall the reader that we mainly concentrate on the two main search
channels, that is the gluon–gluon fusion and Higgs–strahlung processes,
but we also mention very briefly the two other productions channels for
single Higgs production: the vector boson fusion and the associated
Higgs production with top quark pairs.

The Higgs production at hadron colliders, as for any hadronic process,
requires that the partonic elements which actually collide have to be
extracted from the initial (anti)protons. This is summarized by the
factorization procedure which is behind the concept of parton
distribution functions (PDFs): a PDF for a parton Y evaluated at the
scale @xmath and for a momentum fraction @xmath is the probability to
extract from the (anti)proton the parton Y at the scale @xmath with a
linear momentum @xmath where @xmath is the initial linear momentum of
the (anti)proton. We then have to factorize the PDF with the partonic
production cross section.

If we call @xmath for the center–of–mass energy and @xmath for the
partonic center–of–mass energy, @xmath for the momentum fraction of the
first parton and @xmath for the momentum fraction of the second parton,
we have @xmath in the massless limit for the two incoming partons, which
is always the case at current hadronic colliders (we just have to
compare the mass of the (anti)proton which is nearly 1 GeV to the
Tevatron 1.96 TeV center–of–mass energy). We then have

  -- -------- -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath                  (4.2)
                 @xmath      
  -- -------- -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the partonic cross section @xmath and @xmath is the
usual step function. The dependence of the PDFs over the scale @xmath
called the factorization scale @xmath has been made implicit in the
equation above for simplification. We sum over all possible initial
partonic states and we could also include additional jets in the
production denoted collectively by @xmath . If we make the following
variable replacement @xmath we obtain

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

then followed by the reordering of the interval of variation of @xmath
and @xmath which then gives

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

We finally use the following variables: @xmath , @xmath and obtain

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

The quantity @xmath is called the @xmath luminosity. This quantity
encodes all the necessary information that is stored in the PDFs.

We are now ready to describe the calculation of the production cross
sections of the two main channels at the Tevatron.

##### 4.1.1 The gluon–gluon fusion

The production rate for the @xmath process, where X denotes the
additional jets that appear at higher orders in QCD, is evaluated
following the Eq. 4.5 . We then define the variable @xmath which is our
@xmath , and we also define a new variable @xmath wich quantify the
departure from the soft–gluon limit @xmath where @xmath with no jets
production.

This cross section is already a loop calculation at leading order (LO)
in QCD, as it involves in the SM triangular quark loops, mainly the top
quark and in a lesser extent the bottom quark, see Fig. 12 . We write
the total cross section in @xmath expansion as

  -- -------- -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath                  (4.6)
                 @xmath      
  -- -------- -- -------- -- -------

@xmath means either @xmath which occurs already at LO, or @xmath and
@xmath / @xmath / @xmath pairs which occur from the NLO, see Fig. 13 for
typical NLO diagrams. @xmath is the LO kernel and @xmath is the @xmath
th order correction to the total cross section induced by a @xmath
partonic initial state. We have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath GeV @xmath as the Fermi constant. In Eq. 4.7 we have @xmath
and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (4.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

The cross section for SM Higgs production in gluon–gluon fusion is then
evaluated in the following way. Up to NLO in QCD we use the Fortran code
HIGLU [ 152 ] ¹⁵ ¹⁵ 15 The public code is available in Ref. [ 153 ] .
which includes the complete set of radiative corrections at this order,
taking into account the full dependence on the top and bottom quark
masses [ 105 ] . We also want to take into account the NNLO corrections
that are known in an effective approach where only the dominant top
quark contribution is included in the limit where the top mass in taken
as infinite [ 107 , 108 , 109 ] , see Fig. 14 for some NNLO diagrams.
These contribution are implemented into the code taking the analytical
expression given in Ref. [ 108 ] . We rescale the NNLO correction by the
full @xmath dependent Born cross section, an approximation which at NLO
is accurate at the level of a few percent for Higgs masses below the
@xmath kinematical threshold, @xmath GeV [ 105 , 106 ] .

The dependence on the renormalization scale @xmath and the factorization
scale @xmath of the partonic NNLO cross sections has been reconstructed
from the scale independent expressions of Ref. [ 108 ] using the fact
that the full hadronic cross sections do not depend on them and the
@xmath running between the @xmath and @xmath scales ¹⁶ ¹⁶ 16 The
analytical expressions for the scale dependence have only been given in
Ref. [ 109 ] in the limit @xmath from which one can straightforwardly
obtain the case @xmath as stated in the text (see also Ref. [ 154 ] ). .
Indeed, the complete cross section taking into account all orders in
perturbation theory should not depend on the (unphysical)
renormalization and factorization scales; we first take @xmath and we
then have @xmath . This equation is then expressed in term of the
evolution of the partonic cross section convoluted with DGLAP evolution
for the PDFs, which expressed order by order in @xmath gives the
dependence on the scale @xmath of @xmath (see also Ref. [ 108 ] ).

In the end we can obtain the final @xmath –dependent terms using the
evolution of the strong coupling constant @xmath between @xmath and
@xmath . For NNLO terms the LO evolution is nearly enough:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath as the first term in the @xmath –function of QCD strong
coupling constant @xmath , where @xmath stands for the number of active
flavors in the running (here @xmath ). The NLO running of @xmath with
@xmath is needed only for the NNLO @xmath virtual correction coming from
the LO @xmath diagram. The complete @xmath –dependent terms at NNLO are
available in the appendix A of this section.

What will be the choice for the central scale @xmath ? The usual choice
would be to use @xmath as it seems to be the most natural scale fixed by
the dynamics of the process. Some results using this scale choice can be
found in the first pages of Ref. [ 94 ] and have been derived before
some criticisms, made by the members of the Tevatron New Physics and
Higgs working group (TEVNPHWG) of the CDF and D0 collaborations [ 155 ]
concerning the theoretical modeling of the @xmath production cross
section proposed in the beginning of Ref. [ 94 ] appeared on the web in
May 2010. A new analysis was then derived with a new central scale
@xmath after ICHEP 2010 (in July 2010) as we got aware of the criticisms
only during ICHEP ¹⁷ ¹⁷ 17 The results with @xmath were also presented
in ICHEP, see Ref. [ 156 ] . where the new combined analysis of CDF and
D0 for the Higgs search at the Tevatron was released [ 157 , 91 ] . This
new analysis addressed the criticisms and reinforced the conclusion of
the first pages of Ref. [ 94 ] ¹⁸ ¹⁸ 18 This was presented in the Higgs
Hunting workshop in Orsay which followed ICHEP [ 158 ] . . We will then
use in the rest of the thesis the scale choice @xmath as explained
below.

Although soft–gluon resumation contributions for the total cross section
have been calculated up to next–to–next–to–leading logarithm (NNLL) [
110 ] we do not include them in our calculation. There are also other
additional estimated small contributions at N @xmath LO [ 159 ] as well
as beyond the soft NNLL approximation [ 160 , 161 , 162 , 163 ] that we
do not include. There are some reason to do so, that we explain in three
points:

-   these corrections are known only for the inclusive total cross
    section and not for the cross sections when experimental cuts are
    incorporated; this is also the case for the differential cross
    sections [ 164 , 165 , 166 , 167 ] and many distributions that are
    used experimentally, which have been evaluated only at NNLO at most.
    Even if we concentrate on the total cross section in this work, we
    should have in mind that these results are then used in experimental
    analyses which also take differential cross sections. In order to be
    fully consistent in the whole analysis, our total cross section
    should be calculated at NNLO. This interpretation is strengthened by
    the CDF/D0 analysis itself [ 91 , 92 , 93 ] , as the @xmath cross
    section in this analysis has been broken into three pieces which
    yield different final state signal topologies for the main decay
    @xmath , namely @xmath +0 jet, @xmath +1 jet and @xmath +2 jets or
    more:

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (4.10)
      -- -------- -- --------

    These channels have been analyzed separately and these individual
    components, with @xmath evaluated at NNLO, @xmath evaluated at NLO
    and @xmath evaluated at LO, represent respectively @xmath , @xmath
    and @xmath of the total @xmath cross section at NNLO. Since these
    three pieces add up to @xmath , why using different normalisation
    for these jet cross sections and the total sum, and include
    soft–gluon resumation in the latter and not in the former?

-   it is theoretically not very consistent to fold a resumed cross
    section with PDF sets which do not involve any resumation, as is the
    case for the presently available PDF sets which at at most at NNLO.
    Even if the effects of the resumation on the PDFs might be rather
    small in practice, this has also been discussed in details in Ref. [
    168 ] .

-   it is well known that the NNLL contributions increase the NNLO
    result by a factor of @xmath –15% at the Tevatron [ 110 ] . This
    increase can be very closely approached by evaluating the NNLO cross
    section at @xmath [ 118 , 169 ] which is one of the reasons to use
    this central scale choice, which is then fully consistent with the
    point b) while taking into account this @xmath --15% increase in the
    total cross section ¹⁹ ¹⁹ 19 This choice of ignoring the
    contributions beyond NNLO has also been adopted in Ref. [ 112 ] in
    which the theoretical predictions have been confronted to the CDF/D0
    results, the focus being the comparison between the distributions
    obtained from the matrix elements calculation with those given by
    the event generators and Monte-Carlo programs used by the
    experiments. They find excellent agreement with NNLL calculation at
    a central scale @xmath .

We see here that a central scale @xmath seems more appropriate while
sticking at NNLO order. In fact there is also another reason why this
scale choice is particularly appropriate for gluon–gluon fusion. As
pointed out by Anastasiou and collaborators some time ago [ 118 , 169 ]
(see also Ref. [ 45 ] ), lowering the central value of the
renormalization and factorization scales from @xmath to @xmath improves
the convergence of the perturbative series and is more appropriate to
describe the kinematics of the process. Recalling that if the scale
value @xmath is chosen, the central value of @xmath increases by more
than @xmath , we then end with a NNLO calculation with no difference
between @xmath and @xmath as calculated for instance in [ 111 ] , which
is fully consistent with the PDF order, and which improves the
convergence of the perturbative series. All of these reasons explain
this central scale choice used in the rest of our analysis.

For the electroweak part, we include the complete one–loop corrections
to the @xmath amplitude which have been calculated in Ref. [ 117 ]
taking into account the full dependence on the top/bottom quark and the
@xmath boson masses. These corrections are implemented in the so–called
partial factorization scheme in which the electroweak correction @xmath
is simply added to the QCD corrected cross section at NNLO, @xmath . In
the alternative complete factorization scheme discussed in Ref. [ 117 ]
, the electroweak correction @xmath is multiplied by the fully QCD
corrected cross section, @xmath and, thus, formally involves terms of
@xmath and @xmath which have not been fully calculated. Since the QCD
@xmath –factor is large, @xmath , the electroweak corrections might be
overestimated by the same factor. We have also included the mixed
QCD–electroweak corrections at NNLO due to light-quark loops [ 118 ] .
These are only part of the three–loop @xmath corrections and have been
calculated in an effective approach that is valid only when @xmath and
which cannot be so easily extrapolated to @xmath values above this
threshold; this will be discussed in more details in the next section.
In Ref. [ 118 ] , it has been pointed out that this procedure, i.e.
adding the NLO full result and the mixed QCD–electroweak correction in
the partial factorization scheme, is equivalent to simply including only
the NLO electroweak correction in the complete factorization scheme.

We finally fold the partonic cross section with the MSTW PDF set [ 128 ]
, setting as mentioned above the renormalization and factorization
scales at @xmath . We obtain for the Tevatron energy @xmath TeV the
central values displayed in Fig. 17 for the gluon–gluon fusion
production cross sections as a function of the Higgs mass on the entire
interesting range for the Tevatron experiment. Our results for the total
cross sections are in an excellent agreement with those given in Refs. [
90 , 91 , 92 , 93 , 111 ] . For instance, for @xmath GeV, we obtain with
our procedure a total @xmath cross section of @xmath fb, compared to the
value @xmath fb quoted in Refs. [ 90 , 91 , 92 , 93 , 111 ] . The small
difference comes from the different treatment of the electroweak
radiative corrections (partial factorization plus mixed QCD–electroweak
contributions in our case versus complete factorization in Ref. [ 111 ]
) and another one percent discrepancy can be attributed to the numerical
uncertainties in the various integrations of the partonic sections ²⁰ ²⁰
20 We have explicitly verified, using the program HRESUM [ 170 , 171 ]
which led to the results of Ref. [ 111 ] , that our NNLO cross section
is in excellent agreement with those available in the literature. In
particular, for @xmath GeV and scales @xmath , one obtains @xmath fb
with HRESUM compared to @xmath fb in our case; the 1.5% discrepancy
being due to the different treatment of the electroweak corrections and
the integration errors. Furthermore, setting the renormalization and
factorization scales to @xmath , we find @xmath fb which is in excellent
agreement with the value @xmath fb obtained in Ref. [ 118 ] and with
HRESUM , as well as the value in the NNLL approximation when the scales
are set at their central values @xmath . This gives us confidence that
our implementation of the NNLO contributions in the NLO code HIGLU ,
including the scale dependence, is correct. .

We should also note that for the Higgs mass value @xmath GeV, we obtain
@xmath for the QCD @xmath –factor at NLO and @xmath at NNLO. These
numbers are slightly different from those presented in Ref. [ 112 ] ,
@xmath and @xmath , respectively. The reason is that the @xmath –quark
loop contribution, for which the @xmath –factor at NLO is significantly
smaller than the one for the top quark contribution [ 105 ] has been
ignored for simplicity in the latter paper; this difference will be
discussed in section 4.4 .

##### 4.1.2 The Higgs–strahlung production channels

The Higgs–strahlung processes @xmath and @xmath are also evaluated using
Eq. 4.5 . The variable @xmath is @xmath . It has been shown (see Ref. [
45 ] ) that this process can be interpretated as the Drell–Yan
production @xmath of a virtual vector boson which then splits into a
real vector boson @xmath and a Higgs boson @xmath [ 172 ] . We could
then write @xmath where @xmath is the mass of the virtual vector boson
@xmath , which is subject to vary between @xmath and @xmath . If we
rewrite the equality we can obtain @xmath . In the end, using Eq. 4.5
and the fact that we have to integrate the variable @xmath between
@xmath and 1:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

In Eq. 4.11 the quantity @xmath describes the corrections to the
partonic Drell–Yan process @xmath . At LO we thus have @xmath (with
@xmath as the Kronecker symbol) as only the @xmath partonic initial
state contributes with no QCD correction, Higgs–strahlung processes
being pure electroweak processes at LO. We can calculate @xmath directly
and use the factorization with the Drell–Yan process for HO corrections.
We obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the phase–space two bodies function. @xmath and @xmath
stand for the reduced axial and vector fermion–gauge boson couplings:
@xmath for @xmath , @xmath and @xmath for @xmath where @xmath is the
weak isospin @xmath –projection, @xmath stands for the Weinberg angle
and @xmath is the electric charge of the quark @xmath .

We then add the NLO corrections in the Drell–Yan process, see Fig. 15
for the Feynman diagrams. The exact expressions for the NLO QCD
corrections can be found in Refs. [ 121 , 122 , 123 , 124 , 125 , 45 ] .
The NNLO corrections for @xmath have been presented in Ref. [ 126 ] and
use the NNLO Drell-Yan corrections [ 173 , 174 , 107 ] , see Fig. 16 for
some Feynman diagrams. It is worth mentioning that there are other
specific corrections for Higgs–strahlung processes which occur at NNLO
and that have nothing to do with the Drell–Yan process @xmath , such as
the @xmath channel. They have been reviewed in Ref. [ 45 ] and what
comes out is that we can neglect them at the Tevatron both for @xmath
and @xmath bosons (the @xmath channel does not exist for @xmath channel
for example and is at the pemille level at the Tevatron for the @xmath
channel).

The total Higgs–strahlung cross sections are then calculated in the
following way. We use the Fortran code V2HV [ 153 ] which evaluates the
full cross sections at NLO in QCD. The NNLO QCD contributions to the
cross sections [ 126 ] , as well as the one–loop electroweak corrections
evaluated in Ref. [ 127 ] , are incorporated in the program V2HV by us.
The central scale adopted in this case is the invariant mass of the
@xmath system, @xmath .

Folding the partonic cross sections with the MSTW parton distribution
functions [ 128 ] and setting the renormalization and factorization
scales at the most natural values @xmath , we obtain for the Tevatron
energy @xmath TeV, the central values displayed in Fig. 17 for the
@xmath Higgs production cross sections as a function of the Higgs mass.
Note that including the combined HERA data and the Tevatron @xmath
charge asymmetry data in the MSTW2008 PDF set [ 175 ] might lead to an
increase of the @xmath cross sections by @xmath %; a small change in
@xmath is also expected.

The central values of the cross sections of Higgs–strahlung from @xmath
and @xmath bosons that we obtain are comparable to those given in Refs.
[ 90 , 130 , 131 ] , with at most a @xmath decrease in the low Higgs
mass range, @xmath GeV. The reason is that the quark and antiquark
densities, which are the most relevant in these processes and are more
under control than the gluon densities, are approximately the same in
the new MSTW2008 and old MRST2002 sets of PDFs (although the updated set
includes a new fit to run II Tevatron and HERA inclusive jet data). We
should note that for @xmath GeV for which the production cross sections
are the largest, @xmath fb and @xmath fb, the QCD @xmath –factors are
@xmath at NLO (NNLO), while the electroweak corrections decrease the LO
cross sections by @xmath %. The correcting factors do not change
significantly for increasing @xmath values for the Higgs mass range
relevant at the Tevatron.

We make here a small comment which will simplify the analysis of the
theoretical uncertainties affecting the central predictions. Since in
this case, the NNLO QCD corrections and the one–loop electroweak
corrections have been obtained exactly and no effective approach was
used, only the scale variation and the PDF+ @xmath uncertainties have to
be discussed. In addition, since the NNLO gluon–gluon fusion
contribution to the cross section in the @xmath case, which is absent in
@xmath , is very small at the Tevatron and because the scales and phase
space are only slightly different for the @xmath and @xmath processes,
as the difference @xmath is tiny, the kinematics and the @xmath –factors
for these two processes are very similar. We will thus restrict our
analysis to the @xmath channel but the same results will hold for the
@xmath channel.

##### 4.1.3 The VBF and associated heavy quarks channels

We have also evaluated the cross sections of the two sub-leading
processes @xmath and @xmath that we also include in Fig. 17 for
completeness, we have not entered into very sophisticated
considerations. We have simply followed the procedure outlined in Ref. [
45 ] and used the public Fortran codes again given in Ref. [ 153 ] . The
vector boson total cross section is evaluated at NLO in QCD [ 136 , 137
] at a scale @xmath (where @xmath is the momentum transfer at the gauge
boson leg), while the presumably small electroweak corrections, known
for the LHC [ 176 ] , are omitted. We have not included the recent
partial NNLO QCD corrections presented in Refs. [ 177 , 178 ] , as they
do not modify greatly the central cross section that interest us in this
small update. We have not estimated the uncertainties affecting these
calculations.

In the case of associated @xmath production, the LO cross section is
evaluated at scales @xmath but is multiplied by a factor @xmath over the
entire Higgs mass range to account for the bulk of the NLO QCD
corrections [ 141 , 142 , 143 , 144 ] . In the latter case, we use the
updated value @xmath GeV for the top quark mass [ 179 ] . The only other
update compared to the cross section values given in Ref. [ 45 ] is thus
the use of the recent MSTW set of PDFs.

The cross sections for the vector boson fusion channel in which the
recent MSTW set of PDFs is used agree well with those given in Refs. [
90 , 91 , 180 , 93 ] ²¹ ²¹ 21 The values from Ref. [ 180 ] can be found
in [ 181 ] . . In the case of the @xmath associated production process,
a small difference is observed compared to Ref. [ 45 ] in which the 2005
@xmath GeV value is used: we have a few percent increase of the rate due
the presently smaller @xmath value which provides more phase space for
the process, overcompensating the decrease due to the smaller top–quark
Yukawa coupling. This is shown in Fig. 17 as a function of the Higgs
mass.

Before closing this subsection, let us make a few remarks on the Higgs
decay branching ratios and on the rates for the various individual
channels that are used to detect the Higgs signal at the Tevatron,
bearing in mind that this will be discussed in more details in section 6
. In the interesting range 160 GeV @xmath for which the Tevatron
experiments are most sensitive, the branching ratio for the @xmath is
largely dominant, being above 90%. In addition, in this mass range, the
@xmath cross section is one order of magnitude larger than the cross
sections for the @xmath and @xmath processes as for @xmath GeV for
instance, one has @xmath fb compared to @xmath fb, @xmath fb and @xmath
fb. Thus, the channel @xmath represents, even before selection cuts are
applied, the bulk of the events leading to @xmath final states, where
here @xmath stands for additional jets or leptons coming from @xmath
decays as well as for jets due to the higher order corrections to the
@xmath process. In the lower Higgs mass range, @xmath GeV, all the
production channels above, with the exception of the vector boson @xmath
channel which can be selected using specific kinematical cuts, should be
taken into account but with the process @xmath being dominant for @xmath
GeV. This justifies the fact that we concentrate mainly on the
gluon–gluon fusion and Higgs–strahlung production channels for the study
of the theoretical predictions both for the central cross sections and
the theoretical uncertainties; the inclusion of the other channels would
marginally affect our results, especially in the Higgs mass region
around @xmath GeV where the Tevatron is the most sensitive: the effect
would be below the percent level due to the huge impact of the @xmath
branching fraction.

#### 4.2 Scale variation and higher order terms

The effect of unknown (yet to be calculated) higher order contributions
to production cross sections and differential distributions at hadron
colliders is usually estimated by studying the variation of these
observables, evaluated at the highest known perturbative order, with the
renormalization scale defining the strong coupling constant @xmath scale
and the factorization scale @xmath at which the matching between the
perturbative calculation of the matrix elements, that is the partonic
cross section, and the non–perturbative part which is described in the
parton distribution functions, is performed. These two scales are
unphysical and should be viewed as a technical artefact; indeed the
dependence of the final result on these two scales should be null, as
when all orders of the perturbative series are summed, the observables
should be scale independent. This scale dependence appears only because
the perturbative series are truncated, as only its few first orders are
evaluated in practice. This is the reason this scale dependence is taken
as as a guess of the impact of the higher order contributions.

Starting from a median scale @xmath which, with a smart guess, is
considered as the most “natural” scale of the process and absorbs
potentially large logarithmic corrections, the current convention is to
vary these two scales within the range

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

with the constant factor @xmath to be determined. One then uses the
following equations to calculate the deviation of, for instance, a cross
section @xmath from the central value evaluated at scales @xmath ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.14)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

This procedure is by no means a true measure of the higher order effects
and should be viewed only as providing a guess of the lower limit on the
scale uncertainty. The variation of the scales in the range of Eq. 4.13
can be individual with @xmath and @xmath varying independently in this
domain, with possibly some constraints such as @xmath in order not to
generate “artificially large logarithms”, or collective when, for
example, keeping one of the two scales fixed, say to @xmath , and vary
the other scale in the chosen domain. Another possibility which is often
adopted, is to equate the two scales, @xmath , a procedure that is
possibly more consistent as most PDF sets are determined and evolved
according to @xmath , but which has no theoretical ground as the two
scales enter different parts of the calculation (renormalization versus
factorization).

The choice of the variation domain for a given process, hence the
constant factor @xmath in Eq. 4.13 , is somewhat arbitrary and a matter
of taste: depending on whether one is optimistic or pessimistic, that is
wether one believes or not that the higher order corrections to the
process are under control, it can range from @xmath to much higher
values.

In most recent analyses of production cross sections at hadron
colliders, a kind of consensus has emerged and the domain,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

has been generally adopted for the scale variation. A first remark is
that the condition @xmath to avoid the appearance of large logarithms
might seem too restrictive: after all, these possible large logarithms
can be viewed as nothing else than the logarithms involving the scales
and if they are large, it is simply a reflection of a large scale
dependence. A second remark is that in the case of processes in which
the calculated higher order contributions are small to moderate and the
perturbative series appears to be well behaved ²² ²² 22 This is indeed
the case for some important production processes at the Tevatron, such
as the Drell–Yan process @xmath [ 173 , 174 , 182 , 183 ] , weak boson
pair production [ 184 , 185 , 186 , 187 , 188 ] and even top quark pair
production [ 189 , 190 , 191 ] once the central scale is taken to be
@xmath , which have moderate QCD corrections. , the choice of such a
narrow domain for the scale variation with @xmath , appears reasonable,
as will be seen when we will study the scale dependence of the
Higgs–strahlung processes. However, this might be a complete different
story when dealing with processes in which the calculated radiative
corrections turn out to be extremely large. As the higher order
contributions might also be significant in this case, the variation
domain of the renormalization and factorization scales might have to be
extended and a range with a factor @xmath substantially larger than two
may seem more appropriate ²³ ²³ 23 This would have been the case, for
instance, in top–quark pair production at the Tevatron if the central
scale were fixed to the more “natural” value @xmath (instead of the
value @xmath usually taken [ 189 , 190 , 191 ] ) and a scale variation
within @xmath were adopted. Another well known example is Higgs
production in association with @xmath –quark pairs in which the cross
section can be determined by evaluating the mechanism @xmath [ 192 ] or
@xmath annihilation, @xmath [ 193 , 194 , 195 ] . The two calculations
performed at NLO for the former process and NNLO for the later one, are
consistent only if the central scale is taken to be @xmath instead of
the more ”natural" value @xmath , see Ref. [ 131 ] (page 5). Again,
without prior knowledge of the higher order corrections, it would have
been wiser, if the central scale @xmath had been adopted, to assume a
wide domain, e.g. @xmath , for the scale variation. Note that even for
the scale choice @xmath , the @xmath –factor for the @xmath process
remains very large, @xmath at the Tevatron. In addition, here, it is the
factorization scale @xmath which generates the large contributions
@xmath in a 5 flavour scheme and not the renormalization scale which can
be thus kept at the initial value @xmath . We will study this process in
the section 11.1 and 12.1 in part IV when dealing with MSSM Higgs
production. .

##### 4.2.1 The case of @xmath production

In the case of the @xmath production process, the most natural value for
the median scale would be the Higgs mass itself, @xmath , and if the
effects of the higher order contributions to the cross section is again
usually estimated by varying @xmath and @xmath as in Eq. 4.15 , i.e.
with the choice @xmath and @xmath , we obtain at the Tevatron a
variation of approximately @xmath of the NNLO cross section with this
specific choice [ 107 , 108 ] and the uncertainty drops to the level of
@xmath in the NNLL approximation.

As we have stated in the former section that it is wiser to choose
@xmath as the central scale, e.g. as in. Ref. [ 118 ] , the variation
domain @xmath is then adopted, leading also to a @xmath uncertainty.

Nevertheless, as the @xmath –factor is extraordinarily large in the
@xmath process, @xmath , the domain of Eq. 4.15 for the scale variation
seems too narrow. If this scale domain was chosen for the LO cross
section for instance, the maximal value of @xmath at LO would have never
caught, and by far, the value of @xmath at NNLO, as it should be the
case if the uncertainty band with @xmath were indeed the correct
“measure" of the higher order effects. Only for a much larger value of
@xmath that this would have been the case.

Here, we will use a criterion which allows an empirical evaluation of
the effects of the still unknown high orders of the perturbative series
and, hence, the choice of the variation domain of the factorization and
renormalization scales in a production cross section (or distribution).
This is done in two steps:

1.  The domain of scale variation, @xmath , is derived by calculating
    the factor @xmath which allows the uncertainty band of the lower
    order cross section resulting from the variation of @xmath and
    @xmath , to reach the central value (i.e. with @xmath and @xmath set
    to @xmath ), of the cross section that has been obtained at the
    higher perturbative order.

2.  The scale uncertainty on the cross section at the higher
    perturbative order is then taken to be the band obtained for a
    variation of the scales @xmath and @xmath within the same range and,
    hence, using the same @xmath value.

In the case of the @xmath process at the Tevatron, if the lower order
cross section is taken to be @xmath and the higher order one @xmath ,
this is shown in the left–hand side of Fig. 18 . The figure shows the
uncertainty band of @xmath resulting from a scale variation in the
domain

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with @xmath , which is then compared to @xmath evaluated at the central
scale @xmath . We first observe that, as expected, the uncertainty bands
are larger with increasing values of @xmath .

The important observation that one can draw from this figure is that it
is only for @xmath , i.e. a variation of the scales in a range that is
much wider than the one given in Eq. 4.15 that the uncertainty band of
the LO cross section becomes very close to (and still does not yet reach
for low Higgs mass values) the curve giving the NNLO result. Thus, as
the scale uncertainty band of @xmath is supposed to provide an estimate
of the resulting cross section at NNLO and beyond, the range within
which the two scales @xmath and @xmath should be varied must be
significantly larger than @xmath .

Nevertheless, one might be rightfully reluctant to use @xmath as a
starting point for estimating the higher order effects, as it is well
known that it is only after including at least the next–order QCD
corrections that a cross section is somewhat stabilized and, in the
particular case of the @xmath process, the LO cross section does not
describe correctly the kinematics as, for instance, the Higgs transverse
momentum is zero at this order. We thus explore also the scale variation
of the NLO cross section @xmath instead of that of @xmath and compare
the resulting uncertainty band to the central value of the cross section
again at NNLO (we refrain here from adding the @xmath contribution at
NNLL as well as those arising from higher order corrections, such as the
estimated @xmath correction [ 159 ] ). On the other hand, the choice of
@xmath incorporate much of the higher order correction already at LO as
it lowers the @xmath –factors drastically.

If we had chosen to compare NLO band with NNLO central predictions with
the central scale choice @xmath , we would have been within the band
@xmath and touching the lower limit of the @xmath band ²⁴ ²⁴ 24 see here
the Ref. [ 94 ] where this point is mentioned in a footnote. C.
Anastasiou is thanked for a discussion on this point. . In addition,
this is only for low Higgs masses that we cannot reach the @xmath LO
band with NNLO central prediction. Thus, to attain the (N)LO values of
the @xmath cross section at the Tevatron with the scale variation of the
NLO cross section, when both cross sections are taken at the central
scale choice, we believe that the right choice is the value @xmath , and
hence a domain of scale variation that is wider than that given in Eq.
4.15 . This choice of the domains of scale variation might seem somewhat
conservative at first sight. However, we emphasise again that in view of
the huge QCD corrections which affect the cross section of this
particular process, and which almost spoil completely the convergence of
the perturbative series, this choice appears to be justified, even if
the choice of the central scale adopted here helps to reduce these giant
@xmath –factors. In fact, this scale choice is not so unusual and in
Refs. [ 108 , 109 , 110 , 196 , 197 , 198 ] for instance, scale
variation domains comparable to those discussed here, and sometimes even
wider, have been used for illustration.

In addition, we have mentioned that that the scales @xmath and @xmath
are varied independently and with no restriction such as @xmath for
instance. In fact, this is only a general statement and this requirement
has absolutely no impact on the NNLO analysis as the minimal and maximal
values of @xmath due to scale variation are obtained for equal @xmath
and @xmath values: for a central scale @xmath , we have @xmath for
@xmath and @xmath for @xmath . We then choose for simplicity to take
@xmath and @xmath as equal so that there is no more discussion about the
possibility of generating artificially large logarithms if we take two
widely different @xmath scales.

Thus, in our analysis, rather than taking the usual choice for the scale
domain of variation with @xmath given in Eq. 4.15 , we will adopt the
slightly more conservative possibility given by the wider variation
domain ²⁵ ²⁵ 25 One might argue that since in the case of @xmath , the
NLO and NNLO contributions are both positive and increase the LO rate,
one should expect a positive contribution from higher orders (as is the
case for the re-summed NNLL contribution) and, thus, varying the scales
using @xmath is more conservative, as the obtained maximal value of the
cross section would be smaller than the value that one would obtain for
e.g. @xmath . However, one should not assume that the higher order
contributions always increase the lower order cross sections. Indeed,
had we taken the central scales at @xmath , the NNLO (and even NNLL)
corrections would have reduced the total cross section evaluated at NLO,
see a remark made in Ref. [ 94 ] . Hence, the higher order contributions
to @xmath could well be negative beyond NNLO and could bring the value
of the production cross section close to the lower range of the scale
uncertainty band of @xmath . Another good counter-example of a cross
section that is reduced by the higher order contributions is the process
of associated Higgs production with top quark pairs at the Tevatron
where the NLO QCD corrections decrease the LO cross section by @xmath [
141 , 142 , 143 , 144 ] once the central scale is chosen to be @xmath .

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

Having made this choice for the factor @xmath , we now estimate the
higher order effects of @xmath evaluated at the highest perturbative
order that we take to be NNLO, ignoring again the known small
contributions beyond this fixed order.

The uncertainty bands resulting from scale variation of @xmath at NNLO
in the domain given by Eq. 4.16 is shown in the right–hand side of Fig.
18 as a function of @xmath . As expected, the scale uncertainty is
slightly larger for @xmath than for @xmath . Averaged over the entire
Higgs mass range, the final scale uncertainty is about @xmath . If we
had chosen the usual domain @xmath , the scale variation would have been
of about @xmath for @xmath GeV. The minimal cross section is obtained
for the largest values of the two scales as stated above, @xmath , while
the maximal value is obtained for the lowest value of the
renormalization scale, @xmath , almost independently of the
factorization scale @xmath , but with a slight preference for the lowest
@xmath values, @xmath .

We should note that the @xmath scale uncertainty obtained in Ref. [ 111
] and adopted in earlier publications by the CDF/D0 collaborations [ 90
] is even smaller than the ones discussed above. The reason is that it
is the resummed NNLL cross section, again with @xmath and @xmath , that
was considered, and the scale variation of @xmath is reduced compared to
that of @xmath in this case. As one might wonder if this milder
dependence also occurs for our adopted @xmath value, we have explored
the scale variation of @xmath in the case of @xmath , without the
restriction @xmath . Using again the program HRESUM [ 171 ] , we find
that the difference between the maximal value of the NNLL cross section,
obtained for @xmath and @xmath , and its minimal value, obtained for
@xmath and @xmath , is as large as in the NNLO case (this is also true
for larger @xmath values). The maximal decrease and maximal increase of
@xmath from the central value are still of about @xmath in this case.
Hence, the relative stability of the NNLL cross section against scale
variation, compared to the NNLO case, occurs only for @xmath and may
appear as accidentally due to a restrictive choice of the variation
domain. However, if the additional constraint @xmath is implemented, the
situation would improve in the NNLL case, as the possibility @xmath and
@xmath which minimizes @xmath would be absent and the scale variation
reduced. Nevertheless, even in this case, the variation of @xmath for
@xmath is of the order of @xmath and, hence, the scale uncertainty is
larger than what is obtained in the domain of Eq. 4.15 .

It is important to notice that if the NNLO @xmath cross section,
evaluated at @xmath , is broken into the three pieces with 0,1 and 2
jets, and one applies a scale variation for the individual pieces in the
range @xmath , one obtains with selection cuts similar to those adopted
by the CDF/D0 collaborations [ 112 ] :

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.17)
  -- -- -- --------

Averaged over the various final states with their corresponding weights,
an error on the “inclusive" cross section which is about @xmath is
derived ²⁶ ²⁶ 26 The error might be reduced when including higher–order
corrections in the 1 jet and 2 jet cross sections. . This is very close
to the result obtained in the CDF/D0 analysis [ 91 , 92 , 93 ] which
quotes a scale uncertainty of @xmath on the total cross section, when
the weighted uncertainties for the various jet cross sections are added.
Thus, our alleged conservative choice @xmath for the scale variation of
the total inclusive cross section @xmath , leads to a scale uncertainty
that is very close to that obtained when one adds the scale
uncertainties of the various jet cross sections for a variation around
the more consensual range @xmath .

We also note that when breaking @xmath into jet cross sections, an
additional error due to the acceptance of jets is introduced; the CDF
and D0 collaborations, after weighting, have estimated it to be @xmath .
We do not know if this weighted acceptance error should be considered as
a theoretical or an experimental uncertainty. But this error, combined
with the weighted uncertainty for scale variation, will certainly
increase the total scale error in the CDF/D0 analysis, possibly (and
depending on how the errors should be added) to the level where it
almost reaches or even exceeds our own supposedly “conservative"
estimate.

We could finally give another reason for a more conservative choice of
the scale variation domain for @xmath , beyond the minimal @xmath range.
It is that it is well known that the QCD corrections are significantly
larger for the total inclusive cross section than for that on which
basic selection cuts are applied; see e.g. Refs. [ 164 , 165 , 166 , 167
] . This can be seen from the recent analysis of Ref. [ 112 ] , in which
the higher order corrections to the inclusive cross section for the main
Tevatron Higgs signal, @xmath , have been compared to those affecting
the cross section when selection cuts, that are very similar to those
adopted by the CDF and D0 collaborations in their analysis (namely
lepton selection and isolation, a minimum requirement for the missing
transverse energy due to the neutrinos, and a veto on hard jets to
suppress the @xmath background), are applied. The output of this study
is that the @xmath –factor for the cross section after cuts is @xmath
–30% smaller than the @xmath –factor for the inclusive total cross
section (albeit with a reduced scale dependence). For instance, one has
@xmath and @xmath for @xmath GeV and scales set to @xmath .

Naively, one would expect that this @xmath –30% reduction of the higher
order QCD corrections when selection cuts are applied, if not
implemented from the very beginning in the normalisation of the cross
section after cuts that is actually used by the experiments (which would
then reduce the acceptance of the signal events, defined as @xmath ), to
be at least reflected in the scale variation of the inclusive cross
section and, thus, accounted for in the theoretical uncertainty. This
would be partly the case for scale variation within a factor @xmath from
the central scale, which leads to a maximal reduction of the @xmath
cross section by about @xmath , but not with the choice @xmath made in
Refs. [ 90 , 91 , 92 , 93 ] which would have led to a possible reduction
of the cross section by @xmath % only ²⁷ ²⁷ 27 The discussion is,
however, more involved as one has to consider the efficiencies obtained
with the NNLO calculation compared to that obtained with the Monte–Carlo
used by the experiments; see Ref. [ 112 ] . .

##### 4.2.2 The scale variation uncertainty in Higgs–strahlung processes

We finish this subsection by the discussion of the theoretical
uncertainties in the Higgs strahlung mechanism @xmath , following the
same line of arguments as in the previous subsection.

To evaluate the uncertainties due to the variation of the
renormalisation and factorisation scales in the Higgs–strahlung
processes, the choice of the variation domain is in a sense simpler than
for the @xmath mechanism. Indeed, as the process at leading order is
mediated only by massive gauge boson exchange and is then a pure
electroweak process at the partonic level, only the factorisation scale
@xmath appears when the partonic cross section is folded with the @xmath
and @xmath luminosities and there is no dependence on the
renormalisation scale @xmath at this order. It is only at NLO, when
gluons are exchanged between or radiated from the @xmath initial states,
that both scales @xmath and @xmath appear explicitly.

Using the proposed criterion for the estimate of the perturbative higher
order effects, we thus choose again to consider the variation domain of
the scales from their central values, @xmath with @xmath , of the NLO
cross section to determine the value of the factor @xmath to be used at
NNLO ²⁸ ²⁸ 28 It is clear that in this case the comparison with the LO
prediction would be no use as the scale uncertainty is a pure QCD
uncertainty; the LO partonic cross section being a pure electroweak
process, we would not be consistent to compare a full NNLO calculation
with a scale variation at LO induced only by the PDF through the
factorization scale @xmath . . We display in the left-hand side of Fig.
19 the variation of the NLO cross section @xmath at the Tevatron as a
function of @xmath for three values of the constant @xmath which defines
the range spanned by the scales, @xmath . One sees that, in this case, a
value @xmath is sufficient (if the scales @xmath and @xmath are varied
independently in the chosen domain) in order that the uncertainty band
at NLO reaches the central value of the cross section at NNLO. In fact,
the NLO uncertainty band would have been only marginally affected if one
had chosen the values @xmath , @xmath or even 5. This demonstrates than
the cross sections for the Higgs–strahlung processes, in contrast to
@xmath , are very stable against scale variation, a result that is
presumably due to the smaller @xmath color charges compared to gluons,
@xmath , that lead to more moderate QCD corrections.

In the right–hand side of Fig. 19 , the NNLO @xmath total cross section
is displayed as a function of @xmath for a scale variation @xmath .
Contrary to the @xmath mechanism, the scale variation within the chosen
range is rather mild and only a @xmath (at low @xmath ) to @xmath (at
high @xmath ) uncertainty is observed for the relevant Higgs mass range
at the Tevatron. This had to be expected as the @xmath –factors in the
Higgs–strahlung processes, @xmath and @xmath , are substantially smaller
than those affecting the @xmath fusion mechanism and one expects
perturbation theory to have a better behavior in the former case. This
provides more confidence that the Higgs–strahlung cross section is
stable against scale variation and, thus, that higher order effects
should be small.

#### 4.3 The parton distribution functions puzzle

The second (and sometimes the most important) source of theoretical
uncertainties on production cross sections and distributions at hadron
colliders is due to the still imperfect parametrisation of the parton
distribution functions (PDFs). Within a given parametrisation, for
example the one in the MSTW scheme, these uncertainties are estimated as
follows [ 132 , 199 , 200 ] . The scheme is based on a Hessian matrix
method which enables a characterization of a parton parametrization in
the neighborhood of the global @xmath minimum fit and gives an access to
the uncertainty estimation through a set of PDFs that describes this
neighborhood. The corresponding PDFs are constructed by: @xmath
performing a global fit of the data using @xmath free parameters (
@xmath or 20, depending on the scheme); this provides the nominal PDF or
reference set denoted by @xmath ; @xmath the global @xmath of the fit is
increased to a given value @xmath to obtain the error matrix, this value
is subject to vary between different collaborations; @xmath the error
matrix is diagonalized to obtain @xmath eigenvectors corresponding to
@xmath independent directions in the parameter space; @xmath for each
eigenvector, up and down excursions are performed in the tolerance gap,
@xmath , leading to @xmath sets of new parameters, denoted by @xmath ,
with @xmath . It is worth mentioning that the NNPDF collaboration [ 201
] does not use this method and rely on Monte–Carlo replication sample to
generate its uncertainty PDF sets.

These sets of PDFs can be used to calculate the uncertainty on a cross
section @xmath in the general following way: one first evaluates the
cross section with the nominal PDF @xmath to obtain the central value
@xmath , and then calculates the cross section with the @xmath PDFs,
giving @xmath values @xmath , and defines, for each @xmath value, the
deviations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

The uncertainties are summed quadratically to calculate the cross
section, including the error from the PDFs that are given at the 68% or
90% confidence level (CL),

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

The procedure outlined above has been applied to estimate the PDF
uncertainties in the Higgs production cross sections in the gluon–gluon
fusion mechanism at the Tevatron in Refs. [ 111 , 118 ] . This has led
to a 90% CL uncertainty of @xmath for the low mass range @xmath GeV to
@xmath in the high mass range, @xmath GeV. These uncertainties was
adopted in the early CDF/D0 combined Higgs search and represented the
second largest source of errors after the scale variation. This has been
shown since that at least in the case of the gluon–gluon fusion
mechanism it underestimated the PDF uncertainties for at least the first
reason that will be mentioned below, if not for that of the second that
concerns the strong coupling constant @xmath itself, see in the next
pages.

First of all, the MSTW collaboration [ 128 ] is not the only one which
uses the above scheme for PDF error estimates, as the CTEQ [ 145 ] and
ABKM [ 147 ] collaborations, for instance, also provide similar schemes,
as well as NNLO JR set [ 150 ] appeared in 2010 or HERAPDF [ 149 ]
(NNPDF set [ 201 ] also allows for error estimates even if their method
is a bit different). It is thus more appropriate to compare the results
given by the different sets and take into account the possibly different
errors that are obtained. In addition, as the parameterisations of the
PDFs are different in the various PDF schemes, we might obtain different
central values for the cross sections and the impact of this difference
should also be addressed ²⁹ ²⁹ 29 This difference should not come as a
surprise as, even within the same scheme, there are large differences
when the PDF sets are updated. For instance, as also pointed out in
Refs. [ 111 , 118 ] , @xmath evaluated with the MRST2004 set is
different by more than 10% compared to the current value obtained with
the MSTW2008 set, as a result of a corrected treatment of the @xmath
densities among other improvements. .

These two aspects will be taken into account in the following. We will
begin the analysis by looking at the PDF uncertainties given separately
by MSTW, ABKM and CTEQ. Even if in the case of CTEQ collaboration there
is no NNLO PDFs set yet available, we can still use the available NLO
sets, evaluate the PDF errors on the NLO cross sections and take these
errors as approximately available at NNLO once we rescale the cross
sections by including the NNLO corrections. This constitutes a good
approximation for error estimates that is our goal in this first
analysis.

We then will analyze the results obtained with the current four NNLO
PDFs sets available on the market, that are the MSTW collaboration, the
ABKM PDFs set, the HERA PDF 1.0 and the JR 09 PDF set, comparing only
the central values. This will be full of information and we will see
that there are too many differences between the predictions to discard
the problem. Note that this PDF “puzzle” has been the subject of a
recommendation by the PDF4LHC group, see [ 151 ] . This will also be
discussed.

##### 4.3.1 PDF uncertainties in gluon–gluon fusion

In the case of the @xmath cross section at the Tevatron, the 90% CL PDF
errors using the first three schemes discussed above (namely MSTW, CTEQ,
ABKM) are shown in the left–hand side of Fig. 20 as a function of @xmath
? The spread of the cross section due to the PDF errors is approximately
the same in the MSTW and CTEQ schemes, leading to an uncertainty band of
less than @xmath % in both cases. For instance, in the MSTW scheme and
in agreement with Refs. [ 111 , 118 ] , we obtain a @xmath error for
@xmath GeV and @xmath for @xmath GeV; the errors are only slightly
asymmetric and for @xmath GeV, one has @xmath and @xmath . The errors
are relatively smaller in the ABKM case in the entire Higgs mass range
and, for instance, we obtain a @xmath (7%) error for @xmath GeV.

The left–hand side of Fig. 20 opens a very important issue: the (very!)
large discrepency between the central values of the cross sections
calculated with the differents PDFs sets, with MSTW/CTEQ on the one hand
and ABKM on the other hand, even when taking into account their
individual uncertainties. This problem has been discussed in [ 199 , 147
, 202 ] and is a long–standing issue still pending in the community.
Indeed, the use of the ABKM parametrisation results in a cross section
that is @xmath smaller than the cross section evaluated with the MSTW or
CTEQ PDFs. Thus, even if the PDF uncertainties evaluated within a given
scheme turn out to be relatively small and apparently well under
control, the spread of the cross sections due to the different
parameterisations can be much more important.

If one uses the old way of estimating the PDF uncertainties (i.e. before
the advent of the PDF error estimates within a given scheme) by
comparing the results given by different PDF parameterisations, one
arrives at an uncertainty defined as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.20)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where the central value of the @xmath cross section is taken to be that
given by the MSTW nominal set @xmath ³⁰ ³⁰ 30 We do no include in this
comparison the uncertainties obtain within a given PDF set, which would
add 5% to 7% to the uncertainty quoted. . Hence, for @xmath GeV for
instance, one would have @xmath given by the small difference between
the CTEQ and MSTW central values of the cross section and @xmath given
by the large difference between the ABKM and MSTW central values.

To make the discussion solid and consistent, we have compared the
central predictions obtained when calculating the NNLO hadronic @xmath
cross section using the various available NNLO sets on the market:
besides the already mentioned ABKM [ 147 ] and MSTW [ 128 ] sets, we
have also included the HERA PDF set [ 149 ] and the JR 09 set [ 150 ] .
The result is displayed in the right–hand side of Fig. 20 . As can be
seen, there is a very large spread in the four predictions, in
particular at large @xmath values where the poorly constrained gluon
densities at high– @xmath are involved. The largest rate is obtained
with MSTW, but the cross section using the ABKM set is @xmath lower for
@xmath GeV. That would mean that using the naive way to estimate this
spread would end–up with an approximate @xmath uncertainty only due to
PDF uncertainty! Nearly similar results would have been obtained using
HERAPDF set ³¹ ³¹ 31 It is often argued against the HERAPDF scheme,
which uses consistently only HERA data to determine the flavour
decomposition, that it does not use any jet (Tevatron or DIS) data which
is in principle important in the determination of the gluon densities.
However, HERAPDF describes well not only the Tevatron jet data but also
the @xmath data. Since this is a prediction beyond leading order, it has
also the contributions of the gluon included. This gives an indirect
test that the gluon densities are predicted in a satisfactory way. See
also Ref. [ 203 ] . with the smaller @xmath value, with an approximate
@xmath decrease of the cross section for @xmath GeV.

Nevertheless we would like to keep considering the MSTW scheme for at
least two reasons: first because it is the widest used PDF scheme and
then allows for comparison with other calculation and especially with
the numbers used in [ 90 , 91 , 92 , 93 ] , and then because the MSTW
scheme include the di–jet Tevatron run II data which are of utmost
importance in this context. We will of course not discard the
discrepency outlined above, and try to solve it within the MSTW scheme.

Indeed, the spread of the predictions does not only result from the
different gluon densities used (and it is well known that these
densities are less severely constrained by experimental data than light
quark densities, especially at high Bjorken– @xmath values), but also
from the difference in the value of the strong coupling constant @xmath
which is fitted altogether with the PDF sets. The @xmath process is very
special in light of this issue, as this process is already a one–loop
calculation at LO which is proportionnal to the square of @xmath and the
large NLO and NNLO QCD contributions are, respectively, of @xmath and
@xmath . The @xmath value used in the ABKM set, @xmath at NLO in the
BMSM scheme [ 204 ] , is @xmath smaller than the one in the MSTW set
@xmath at NLO. Similar difference arise with the HERA PDF set ( @xmath
or @xmath at NNLO depending on the PDF set) or with JR 09 set ( @xmath
at NNLO) when compared to MSTW value displayed in Eq. 4.21 ³² ³² 32 The
significant difference between the world average @xmath value [ 205 ]
and the one from deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) data used in the PDFs
is connected to that issue. . Since the @xmath –factors for the
gluon–gluon fusion process are very large at the Tevatron, @xmath and
@xmath , a one percent uncertainty in the input value of @xmath will
generate a @xmath uncertainty in @xmath .

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.21)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Experimental collaborations are now aware of this issue and have started
in 2010 to take into account related “ @xmath ” uncertainties in the
quoted number they use for their analysis, see [ 92 , 93 ] . This
uncertainty was certainly lacking in earlier Tevatron analysis [ 90 , 91
] and that was after the output of Ref. [ 94 ] that the incorporation of
such an uncertainty was widely accepted.

In general, @xmath is fitted together with the PDFs: the PDF sets are
only defined for the special value of @xmath obtained with the best fit
and, to be consistent, this best value of @xmath that we denote @xmath ,
should also be used for the partonic part of the cross section. Indeed
there is an interplay between the PDFs and the value of @xmath and, for
instance, a larger value of @xmath would lead to a smaller gluon density
at low @xmath [ 199 ] . The MSTW collaboration released last year a new
set–up which allows for a simultaneous evaluation of the errors due to
the PDFs and those due to the experimental uncertainties on @xmath of
Eq. 4.21 , taking into account the possible correlations [ 199 ] . The
procedure to obtain the different PDFs and their associated errors is
similar to what was presented in the introduction of this subsection,
but provided is a collection of five PDF+error sets for different @xmath
values: the best fit value @xmath and its 68% CL and 90% CL maximal and
minimal values.

Using the following equations to calculate the PDF error for a fixed
value of @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (4.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

we then compare these five different values and finally arrives, with
@xmath as the best–fit value of @xmath given by the central values of
Eq. 4.21 and @xmath the nominal PDF set with this @xmath value, at the
90% CL PDF+ @xmath errors given by [ 199 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
                 (4.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using this procedure, we have evaluated the PDF+ @xmath uncertainty on
the NNLO @xmath total cross section at the Tevatron and the result is
displayed in the left–hand side of Fig. 21 as a function of @xmath . The
PDF+ @xmath error ranges from @xmath for @xmath GeV to @xmath for @xmath
GeV with, again, a slight asymmetry between the upper and lower values;
for a Higgs mass @xmath GeV, one has @xmath . That is, the experimental
uncertainty on @xmath adds a @xmath error to the PDF error alone over
the entire @xmath range relevant at the Tevatron.

Nevertheless, this larger PDF+ @xmath uncertainty compared to the PDF
uncertainty alone does not yet reconcile the evaluation of MSTW and ABKM
(in this last scheme the @xmath uncertainty has not been included since
no PDF set with an error on @xmath is provided) of the @xmath cross
section at the Tevatron, the difference between the lowest MSTW value
and the highest ABKM value being still at the level of @xmath .

In order to (at least partially) reconcile the MSTW and ABKM/HERA
predictions which differ drastically, we introduce the impact of the
theoretical uncertainy on the value of @xmath . So far, only the impact
of the experimental errors on @xmath has been discussed, while it is
well known that the strong coupling constant is also plagued by
theoretical uncertainties due to scale variation or ambiguities in heavy
quark flavor scheme definition. This theoretical uncertainty has been
estimated in Ref. [ 128 ] to be at least @xmath at NLO which turns out
to be @xmath at NNLO. The estimate of Refs. [ 206 , 207 ] leads to a
slightly larger uncertainty, @xmath . We will begin by using the MSTW
uncertainty, that is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

To calculate in a consistent way the uncertainty due to this @xmath
variation, we use the fixed– @xmath NNLO PDF grid also provided by the
MSTW collaboration, which is a set of central PDFs but at fixed values
of @xmath different from the best–fit value. Values of @xmath in a range
comprised between @xmath and @xmath in steps of 0.001 are selected,
which then include the values @xmath that we will use for our
estimation. We also point out that this also allows for a broader range
of @xmath value, that we will use in the following. Using this PDF grid
with the theoretical error on @xmath of Eq. 4.24 implemented, the upper
and lower values of the cross sections will be given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (4.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

with again @xmath being the MSTW best–fit PDF set at the fixed @xmath
value which is either @xmath or @xmath . For the calculation with ABKM
set, we use a naive estimate, that is use the central PDF set at the
central @xmath but with different @xmath values, as this PDFs set does
not provide different PDFs set according to a variation in the value of
the strong coupling constant.

Nevertheless with this procedure and the value adopted in Eq. 4.24 the
uncertainty is still far from solving the issue. Indeed, as pointed in
Ref. [ 94 ] , taking this additional uncertainty with the value of
@xmath in Eq. 4.24 would have reconciled the MSTW/CTEQ and ABKM/HERA
prediction only in the case where @xmath . When switching to @xmath , it
seems that this increases the spread between the differents PDFs sets
predictions. We will then take as @xmath the difference between the
strong coupling constant value in the MSTW set and in the ABKM set. This
gives in the end

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

Note that despite of the fact that the uncertainty on @xmath is that of
a theoretical and is not at the 90% CL, we will take the PDF+ @xmath
error that one obtains using Eq. 4.25 to be at the 90% CL. In this way
we will be able to add the uncertainty to the rest: to obtain the total
PDF+ @xmath uncertainty, we then add in quadrature the PDF+ @xmath and
PDF+ @xmath uncertainties,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.27)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The result for the total PDF+ @xmath 90% CL uncertainty on @xmath in the
MSTW scheme using the procedure outlined above is shown in the
right–hand side of Fig. 21 as a function of @xmath and compared to the
result when the PDF error in the ABKM scheme is combined with the @xmath
and @xmath uncertainties using the naive procedure briefly mentioned
previously as, in this case, no PDF with an @xmath value different from
that obtained with the best–fit is provided. Stretching the range of
@xmath to @xmath thus helps to reconcile MSTW and ABKM predictions as
can be seen on the graph, the two uncertainty bands overlaping.

We then compare MSTW PDF, PDF+ @xmath and the total PDF+ @xmath
uncertainties in Fig. 22 . The total uncertainty due to the PDF and
theoretical and experimental errors on the strong coupling constant
@xmath is now significant, and amounts to @xmath to @xmath on the
central cross section depending on the @xmath value. This is still a bit
larger than the 12.5% error which has been assumed in the most recent
CDF/D0 combined analyses [ 92 , 93 ] , and of course even larger than
the @xmath assumed in the earliest Tevatron analysis [ 90 ] ) where the
strong coupling constant uncertainties were lacking.

In any case we face the situation where we have large differences in the
predictions obtained using the various PDFs set on the market. This is
what we call the “pdf puzzle”; this is also discussed in Ref. [ 208 ]
which analyzes the question of the discrepency between global fits and
DIS fits predictions, assessing that this can be relied to NMC data
handling in the PDFs.

##### 4.3.2 The case of Higgs–strahlung processes

In the case of the associated Higgs boson production with a @xmath
boson, @xmath , we follow the same line of arguments developed above in
the case of the gluon–gluon fusion. We recall that the case of the
associated production with a @xmath boson is absolutely similar to that
of the @xmath boson.

We thus calculate the PDF, PDF+ @xmath and PDF+ @xmath 90% CL
uncertainties in the MSTW scheme and compare it to what could be
obtained using the ABKM PDFs set. In this case we use the @xmath value
of Eq. 4.26 as it is sufficient to reconcile the different predictions
as seen in the results below.

The results are displayed in Fig. 23 and Fig. 24 for the Tevatron
center–of–mass energy 1.96 TeV and for Higgs mass relevant in the
Tevatron SM Higgs searches. The spread of the MSTW/CTEQ/ABKM schemes is
displayed in Fig. 23 . The uncertainty bands are of order @xmath in
CTEQ/MSTW schemes and slightly larger in ABKM PDFs set. The discrepancy
between central predictions is of order @xmath which is nearly three
times less than compared to the gluon–gluon fusion case. This does not
constitute a surprise as at LO the Higgs–strahlung processes use quark
densities which are better known than gluon density. However, contrary
to the gluon–gluon fusion case, the MSTW/CTEQ and ABKM bands almost
touch each other.

In the left–hand side of Fig. 24 , we show the bands resulting from the
PDF+ @xmath uncertainty in the MSTW mixed scheme, while the right–hand
side of the figure shows the uncertainty bands when the additional
theoretical error @xmath is included in both the MSTW scheme using Eq.
4.27 and ABKM scheme using the naive estimate and Eq. 4.25 . As
expected, the errors due to the imprecise value of @xmath are much
smaller than in the @xmath mechanism, as in Higgs–strahlung, the process
does not involve @xmath in the Born approximation and the @xmath
–factors are reasonably small, @xmath . Hence, @xmath generates an
additional error that is about @xmath when included in the PDF fits,
while the error due to @xmath is about one to two percent.

In any case, the total PDF+ @xmath + @xmath uncertainty is at the level
of @xmath –8% in the MSTW scheme, that is slightly larger than the
errors due to the PDFs alone, and we again have a significant overlap
between the MSTW and ABKM uncertainty band but with the use of MSTW
theoretical error estimate of @xmath .

To conclude this subsection we would like to insist on the fact that the
procedure that we have used is only one particular way of handling the
PDF puzzle which is still currently pending and on active investigation
by theorists, especially in the view of the LHC predictions. In
particular we could also have used the difference between the central
predictions given by the different NNLO PDFs set on the market, that is
the MSTW, ABKM, HERA and JR sets. The PDF uncertainty, when compared to
the central MSTW prediction, would have ended being of order @xmath in
the critical range @xmath GeV, as seen in the right–hand side of Fig. 20
.

We also note that there is another recipe that has been suggested by the
PDF4LHC working group for evaluating PDF uncertainties for NNLO cross
sections (besides taking the envelope of the predicted values obtained
using several PDF sets) [ 209 ] : take the 68% CL MSTW PDF+ @xmath error
and multiply it by a factor of two [ 210 ] . In our case, this would
lead to an uncertainty of @xmath which, for the minimal value, is close
to the recipe discussed just above, and is larger than what we obtain
when considering the PDF+ @xmath uncertainty given by MSTW. This gives
some credits to our way of handling the PDF issue.

#### 4.4 Effective field theory and its uncertainties

This subsection is intended to cover a specific issue in the gluon–gluon
fusion production channel and will not concern the Higgs–strahlung
mechanism. Indeed, while both the QCD and electroweak radiative
corrections to the process @xmath have been calculated exactly at NLO
taking into account both the top quark and the bottom quarks loop with
the exact finite mass of both quark flavours, these corrections are
derived at NNLO only in an effective field theory (EFT) approach in
which the loop particles are assumed to be very massive, @xmath , and
integrated out. Thus these corrections have only been calculated for the
top loop and currently there are no NNLO corrections for the @xmath
–quark loop available.

##### 4.4.1 The @xmath–loop uncertainty

At the Born level, taking into account only the dominant contribution of
the top quark loop and working in the limit @xmath provides an
approximation [ 105 , 106 ] that is only good at the 10% level for Higgs
masses below the @xmath kinematical threshold, @xmath GeV. The
difference from the exact result is mainly due to the absence of the
contribution of the @xmath –quark loop: although the @xmath –quark mass
is small, the @xmath amplitude exhibits a dependence @xmath which, for
relatively low values of the Higgs mass, generates a non–negligible
contribution that interferes destructively with the dominant top–quark
loop contribution. In turn, when considering only the top quark loop in
the @xmath amplitude, the approximation @xmath is extremely good for
Higgs masses below @xmath , compared to the amplitude with the exact top
quark mass dependence as shown in Refs. [ 107 , 108 , 109 ] .

In the NLO approximation for the QCD radiative corrections, it has been
shown [ 105 ] that the exact @xmath –factor when the full dependence on
the top and bottom quark masses is taken into account, @xmath , is
smaller than the @xmath factor obtained in the approximation in which
only the top quark contribution is included and the asymptotic limit
@xmath is taken, @xmath . The reason is that when only the @xmath –quark
loop contribution is considered in the @xmath amplitude (as in the case
of supersymmetric theories in which the @xmath –quark Yukawa coupling is
strongly enhanced compared to its Standard Model value [ 211 ] , see
section 11 ), the @xmath –factor for the @xmath cross section at the
Tevatron is about @xmath to 1.5, instead of @xmath when only the top
quark is included in the loop. The approximation of infinite loop
particle mass significantly improves when the full @xmath mass
dependence is included in the LO order cross section and @xmath gets
closer to the cross section @xmath in which the exact @xmath dependence
is taken into account.

The difference between @xmath and @xmath at Tevatron energies is shown
in Fig. 25 as a function of the Higgs mass we show that there is a few
percent discrepancy between the two cross sections. As mentioned
previously, in the Higgs mass range 115 GeV @xmath GeV relevant at
Tevatron energies, this difference is only due to the absence of the
@xmath –quark loop contribution and its interference with the top quark
loop in the @xmath amplitude and not to the fact that the limit @xmath
is taken.

At NNLO, because of the complexity of the calculation, only the result
in the effective approach in which the loop particle masses are assumed
to be infinite is available. In the case of the NNLO QCD corrections [
107 , 108 , 109 ] , the @xmath –quark loop contribution and its
interference with the contribution of @xmath –quark loop is therefore
missing. Since the NNLO correction increases the cross section by @xmath
, the question wether this missing piece might lead to an overestimate
of the total @xmath –factor should be asked. We will assume that it
might be indeed the case and assign an error on the NNLO QCD result
which is approximately the difference between the exact result @xmath
and the approximate result @xmath obtained at NLO while taking the exact
LO result and shown in Fig. 25 , but rescaled with the relative
magnitude of the @xmath –factors that is obtained at NLO and NNLO, i.e.
@xmath . This leads to an uncertainty on the NNLO cross section which
ranges from @xmath for low Higgs values @xmath GeV at which the @xmath
–quark loop contribution is significant at LO, to the level of @xmath
for Higgs masses above @xmath GeV for which the @xmath –quark loop
contribution is much smaller. This uncertainty is not really taken into
account in the scale uncertainty, as we are not only missing the @xmath
–loop contribution but also, and mainly if we compare to what happens at
NLO, the (likely negative) top–bottom interference at NNLO which can be
significant. This interference term cannot be really well estimated
through NNLO scale variation as the latter will mainly estimate missing
N @xmath LO terms.

In addition we should also assign to the @xmath –quark contribution an
error originating from the freedom in choosing the input value of the
@xmath --quark mass in the loop amplitude and the scheme in which it is
defined ³³ ³³ 33 We thank M. Spira for reminding us of this point. .
Indeed, apart from the difference obtained when using the @xmath –quark
pole mass, @xmath GeV, as we have done here, or the running @xmath mass
evaluated at the scale of the @xmath –quark mass, @xmath GeV, there is
an additional @xmath factor which enters the cross section when
switching from the on–shell to the @xmath scheme. This leads to an error
of approximately 1% on the total cross section, over the @xmath range
that is relevant at the Tevatron. In contrast, according to very recent
calculations [ 212 , 213 , 214 , 215 ] , the @xmath limit is a very good
approximation for the top–quark loop contribution to @xmath at NNLO as
the higher order terms, when expanding the amplitude in power series of
@xmath , lead to a difference that is smaller than one percent for
@xmath GeV.

##### 4.4.2 The electroweak uncertainty

The other part of the calculation that is concerned by an effective
theory approach deals with the electroweak corrections in @xmath
production channel. As mentioned previously, while the @xmath NLO
corrections have been calculated with the exact dependence on the loop
particle masses [ 117 ] , the mixed QCD–electroweak corrections due to
light quark loops at @xmath have been evaluated [ 118 ] in the effective
theory approach where the @xmath bosons have been integrated out and
which is only valid for @xmath . These contributions are approximately
equal to the difference between the exact NLO electroweak corrections
when evaluated in the complete factorization and partial factorization
schemes [ 118 ] .

However, as the results for the mixed corrections are only valid at most
for @xmath and given the fact that the @xmath electroweak correction at
@xmath exhibits a completely different behavior below and above the
@xmath threshold ³⁴ ³⁴ 34 Indeed, the NLO electroweak correction @xmath
of Ref. [ 117 ] is positive below the @xmath threshold @xmath for which
the effective approach is valid in this case and turns to negative for
@xmath for which the effective approach cannot be applied and the
amplitude develops imaginary parts. This behavior can also be seen in
Fig. 26 which, up to the overall normalisation, is to a very good
approximation the @xmath correction factor given in Fig. 1 of Ref. [ 117
] for @xmath . , one should be cautious and assign an uncertainty to
this mixed QCD–electroweak correction, even if this may overestimate the
uncertainty due to EFT effects. Conservatively, we then have chosen in
Ref. [ 94 ] to assign an error that is of the same size as the @xmath
contribution itself. This is equivalent to assigning an error to the
full @xmath contribution that amounts to the difference between the
correction obtained in the complete factorization and partial
factorization schemes as done in Ref. [ 117 ] . As pointed out in the
latter reference, this reduces to adopting the usual and
well–established procedure that has been used at LEP for attributing
uncertainties due to unknown higher order effects. We then obtain an
uncertainty ranging from 1.5% to 3.5% for Higgs masses below @xmath and
below 1.5% for larger Higgs masses as is shown in Fig. 26 .

Finally, we should note that we do not address here the issue of the
threshold effects from virtual @xmath and @xmath bosons which lead to
spurious spikes in the @xmath electroweak correction in the mass range
@xmath –190 GeV which includes the Higgs mass domain that is most
relevant at the Tevatron (the same problem occurs in the case of the
@xmath cross sections once the electroweak corrections are included).
These singularities are smoothened by including the finite widths of the
@xmath bosons, a procedure which might introduce potential additional
theoretical ambiguities that has been ignored in the analysis of Ref. [
94 ] upon which is constructed a large part of this thesis.

#### 4.5 Combination and total uncertainty

We present in this subsection the tables which summarize the individual
sources of theoretical uncertainties, and we discuss how to combine them
to obtain the overall theoretical uncertainty. We start with the
gluon–gluon fusion process and then turn our attention to the
Higgs–strahlung channels.

The central cross section in the @xmath process at the Tevatron, as well
as the various associated theoretical uncertainties, are summarized in
Table 2 . For a set of Higgs mass values that is relevant at the
Tevatron (we choose a step of 5 GeV as done by the CDF and D0
experiments [ 90 , 91 , 92 , 93 ] except in the critical range 160–170
GeV where a 2 GeV step has been adopted), the second column of the table
gives the central values of the total cross section at NNLO (in fb) for
the renormalization and factorization scale choice @xmath , when the
partonic cross sections are folded with the MSTW parton densities. The
following columns give the errors on the central value of the cross
section originating from the various sources discussed in subsection 4.2
/ 4.3 / 4.4 , namely, the uncertainties due to the scale variation in
the adopted range @xmath with @xmath , the 90% CL errors due to the MSTW
PDF, PDF+ @xmath and PDF+ @xmath + @xmath uncertainties as well as the
estimated uncertainties from the use of the effective approach in the
calculation of the NNLO QCD (the @xmath –quark loop contribution and its
interference with the top–quark loop) and electroweak (difference
between the complete and partial factorization approaches) radiative
corrections.

The largest of these errors, @xmath , is due to the scale variation,
followed by the PDF+ @xmath uncertainties which are at the level of
@xmath ; the errors due to the effective theory approach (including that
due to the definition of the @xmath –quark mass) are much smaller, being
of the order of a few percent for both the QCD and electroweak parts.

The very important issue which remains to be solved is how to combine
these various uncertainties. We present here the procedure that was
developed in Ref. [ 94 ] and then used for the following analyses at the
LHC and in the MSSM (see the following sections). In accord with Refs. [
112 , 210 ] , there is currently a vivid debate whether to add these
errors in quadrature as done, for instance, by the CDF and D0
collaborations ³⁵ ³⁵ 35 In earlier analyses, the CDF collaboration [ 216
, 217 ] adds in quadrature the 10.9% scale uncertainty obtained at NNLL
with a scale variation in the range @xmath with a 5.1% uncertainty due
the errors on the MSTW PDFs (not including the errors from @xmath ),
resulting in a 12% total uncertainty. The D0 collaboration [ 218 , 217 ]
assigns an even smaller total error, 10%, to the production cross
section. This has changed a lot in the most recent analyses where they
quote an approximate 20% total uncertainty using PDF+ @xmath
uncertainties and jet–analysis for scale uncertainties which amounts to
@xmath . [ 216 , 218 , 217 ] or not, and we believe that quadratic
addition should be the accurate procedure when dealing with theoretical
uncertainties.

To begin with, the uncertainties associated to the PDF parameterisations
should be viewed as theoretical errors and they have been considered as
such since a long time. Indeed, although the PDF sets use various
experimental data which have intrinsic errors which then induce
“might-be” statistical grounds, the main uncertainty is due to the
theoretical assumptions which go into the different parameterizations.
This uncertainty cannot be easily quantified within one given
parametrization but it is reflected in the spread of the central values
given by the various PDF parameterizations that are available. If the
PDF uncertainty is defined as to be the difference in the cross sections
when using the different available PDF sets, as recommanded for example
by the PDF4LHC recommendation [ 151 ] , this uncertainty has no
statistical ground.

For the scale uncertainty, the situation is of course clear: it has no
statistical ground at all and any value of the cross section in the
uncertainty band is as respectable as another ³⁶ ³⁶ 36 In statistical
language, both the scale and PDF uncertainties have a flat prior. See
Refs. [ 95 , 210 ] for a more elaborated discussion on this subject. It
is worth mentioning that Ref. [ 210 ] recommands a linear combination. .
The same is also true for the uncertainties due to the use of an
effective approach: they should be viewed as purely theoretical
uncertainties and thus be addded linearly with each others.

As a result, the scale and PDF uncertainties, cannot be combined in
quadrature as done, for instance, by the CDF and D0 collaborations. This
is especially true as in the @xmath process, a strong correlation
between the renormalization and factorization scales that are involved
(and that we have equated here for simplicity, @xmath ), the value of
@xmath and the @xmath densities is present. For instance, decreasing
(increasing) the scales will increase (decrease) the @xmath cross
section not only because of the lower (higher) @xmath value that is
obtained and which decreases (increases) the magnitude of the matrix
element squared (that is proportional to @xmath at leading order and the
cross section is minimal/maximal for the highest/lowest @xmath values),
but also because at the same time, the @xmath densities become smaller
(larger) for higher (smaller) @xmath values. Some of these issues have
been discussed in details in Ref. [ 209 ] . On the other hand, if we add
everything linearly it might appear too conservative and also because of
the aforementioned reasons.

We then have proposed a rather simple procedure to combine at least the
two largest uncertainties, those due to the scale variation and to the
PDF+ @xmath uncertainties that may avoid the drawbacks of the two other
possibilities mentioned above and have been presented for the first time
in Ref. [ 94 ] . We review this procedure below.

One first derives the maximal and minimal values of the production cross
sections when the renormalization and factorization scales are varied in
the adopted domain, that is, @xmath with @xmath being the cross section
evaluated for the central scales @xmath and the deviations @xmath given
in Eq. 4.14 . We then evaluate, on these maximal and minimal cross
sections from scale variation, the PDF+ @xmath as well as the PDF+
@xmath uncertainties (combined in quadrature) using the new MSTW set-up,
i.e as in Eq. ( 4.27 ) but with @xmath replaced by @xmath .

We then obtain the maximal and minimal values of the cross section when
scale, PDF and @xmath (both experimental and theoretical) uncertainties
are included,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.28)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

To these new maximal and minimal cross sections, we finally add in the
case of gluon–gluon fusion the smaller EFT uncertainty, that is the one
resulting from the missing @xmath --loop at NNLO and the small EW
uncertainties. This last addition is linear as these errors have no
correlations with the scale and PDF uncertainties ³⁷ ³⁷ 37 In the case
of the @xmath –loop contribution, the @xmath –factor when varying the
scale from the central value @xmath to the values @xmath or @xmath
.which maximise and minimise the cross section, might be slightly
different and thus, the error will not be exactly that given in Table 2
. However, since the entire effect is very small, we will ignore this
tiny complication here. .

The two last columns of Table 2 display the maximal and minimal
deviations of the @xmath cross section at the Tevatron when all
uncertainties are added, as well as the percentage deviations of the
cross section from the central value. We should note that the actual
PDF+ @xmath uncertainty and the uncertainty from the use of the
effective theory approach are different from those of Table 2 , which
are given for the best value of the cross section, obtained for the
central scale choice @xmath ; nevertheless, the relative or percentage
errors are approximately the same for @xmath and @xmath .

Doing so for the @xmath NNLO cross section with a central scale @xmath ,
we obtain the total error shown in Fig. 27 , that we compare to the
@xmath error assumed in the CDF/D0 analysis. For @xmath GeV for example,
we obtain @xmath , that is a spread from the central value @xmath fb
which is up to @xmath fb and down to @xmath fb. This is also shown in
Table 2 in the last columns where all theoretical uncertainties are
combined. This large variation of approximately @xmath is seen on the
entire Higgs mass range. We should also note that the central cross
section displayed in Fig. 27 is in excellent agreement with Ref. [ 111 ]
; the striking new result is then the large uncertainties that we have
found.

Hence, our procedure for the combination does not reduce to a linear sum
of all uncertainties. If we had added linearly all errors, we would have
had, for the negative part at @xmath GeV, a total uncertainty of @xmath
, compared to the value @xmath with our procedure. On the other hand,
one has an error of @xmath , i.e. close to the total error assumed by
CDF/D0 if the scale and PDF+ @xmath uncertainties were added in
quadrature and the EFT approach error linearly (the latter being ignored
by the CDF/D0 collaborations). We also want to point out that the Ref. [
210 ] in its last section recommands a procedure of combination which is
linear, as the prior on the different theoretical uncertainties are not
gaussian. Thus our combination is far from being too conservative or
exaggerated.

The consequences on the exclusion limits quoted by CDF and D0
collaborations on the Higgs mass range between 158 and 173 GeV [ 91 , 92
, 93 ] will be discussed in the section 6.5 . We can already tell than
they should be taken with caution in the light of our uncertainties.

We now discuss the results in the Higgs–strahlung processes and
similarly to the @xmath case we display in Table 3 the central values of
the cross sections for @xmath and @xmath at the Tevatron, evaluated at
scales @xmath with the MSTW set of PDFs (second and third columns). In
the remaining columns, we display only the @xmath channel results about
the uncertainties coming from the scale variation (with @xmath ), the
PDF, mixed PDF+ @xmath and PDF+ @xmath + @xmath uncertainties in the
MSTW scheme. In the last columns, we give the total error and its
percentage; this percentage error is, to a very good approximation, the
same in the @xmath channel which explains why we have chosen to study
the @xmath boson channel only, recalling that the result for the @xmath
boson channel are in a very good approximation obtained by rescaling the
absolute error by the correct central value.

In contrast to the @xmath mechanism, since the errors due to scale
variation are rather moderate in this case, there is no large difference
between the central cross section @xmath and the cross sections @xmath
and, hence, the PDF, PDF+ @xmath and PDF+ @xmath + @xmath errors on
@xmath are, to a good approximation, the same as the errors on @xmath
displayed in Table 3 .

The total uncertainty is once more summarized in Fig. 28 , where the
cross sections for @xmath and @xmath associated production at the
Tevatron, together with the total uncertainty bands (in absolute values
in the main frame and in percentage in the insert), are displayed as a
function of the Higgs mass. The total error on the cross sections in the
Higgs–strahlung processes is about @xmath in the entire Higgs mass
range, possibly 1% to 2% smaller for low @xmath values and @xmath larger
for high @xmath values, as displayed in the figure. Thus, the
theoretical errors are much smaller than in the case of the @xmath
process and the cross sections for the Higgs–strahlung processes are
well under control. Nevertheless, it is worth mentionning that the total
uncertainty that is obtained in our analysis is almost twice as large as
the total 5% uncertainty assumed by the CDF and D0 collaborations in
their combined analysis of this channel [ 90 , 91 , 92 , 93 ] .

Before closing this section, we point out that the uncertainties in the
Higgs–strahlung processes can be significantly reduced by using the
Drell–Yan processes of massive gauge boson production as standard
candles, as first suggested in Ref. [ 219 ] . Indeed, normalizing the
cross sections of associated @xmath and @xmath production to the cross
sections of single @xmath and @xmath production, respectively, allows
for a cancellation of several experimental errors such as the error on
the luminosity measurement, as well as the partial cancellation (since
the scales that are involved in the @xmath and @xmath processes are
different) theoretical errors such as those due to the PDFs, @xmath and
the higher order radiative corrections.

#### 4.6 Summary and outlook

In this section were presented the theoretical predictions for the
Standard Model Higgs boson production total cross section at the
Tevatron in the two main channels, the gluon–gluon fusion @xmath and the
Higgs–strahlung processes @xmath , where @xmath stands for either the
@xmath or the @xmath boson. We have assumed a central scale @xmath to be
@xmath for the gluon–gluon fusion process and @xmath (the invariant mass
of the pair @xmath ) for the Higgs–strahlung processes, and calculated
the cross section up to NNLO in QCD and EW corrections.

We have then estimated the theoretical uncertainties associated to the
prediction: the scale uncertainty, the uncertainties from the PDF
parametrisation and the associated error on @xmath , as well as
uncertainties due to the use of the EFT approach for the mixed
QCD-electroweak radiative corrections and the @xmath -quark loop
contribution in the gluon–gluon fusion case. The major result is that we
obtain in the critical region for Higgs searches at the Tevatron, that
is the region @xmath –173 GeV, an overall theoretical uncertainty of
order @xmath when using our procedure of combination of the
uncertainties. That is twice the uncertainty used in the experimental
analyses of the CDF/D0 collaborations [ 91 , 92 , 93 ] . This is a mere
consequence of the different ways to combine the individual scale and
PDF+ @xmath uncertainties and, to a lesser extent, the impact on the
theoretical uncertainty on @xmath and the EFT uncertainties which have
not been considered by the CDF/D0 collaborations. The uncertainty
obtained in the Higgs–strahlung mechanism is of order @xmath , which
implies that this process is much more under control than the
gluon–gluon fusion mechanism. The uncertainty is also twice the one
assumed in low Higgs mass searches at the Tevatron [ 91 , 92 , 93 ] .

The consequence of this doubling of the errors will be analyzed in
section 6.5 . Before that we now turn our attention on the Higgs
production at the other hadron colliders which has started to run in
2010 in the TeV energy range: the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
Indeed, it is of crucial importance to analyze the theoretical
uncertainties affecting the Higgs production at the LHC as it is the
designed machine to discover the Higgs boson: theoretical uncertainties
have an impact not only on the discovery of the elusive boson but also
on its couplings to fermions and gauge bosons [ 220 , 221 , 222 ] .

### Appendix A Appendix: analytical terms for NNLO @xmath–dependent
corrections to @xmath total cross section

We present in this appendix the exact analytical expressions for the
NNLO corrections which include @xmath terms. Even if this expressions
can be recovered in a straightforward way, they are not presented in the
current literature and it may be of use to present them in their all
extent.

We write @xmath with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and @xmath is the variable defined as @xmath . We separate the
expression of @xmath in two pieces as done in the literature: the
soft+virtual part containing the virtual corrections as well as the
soft–gluon terms with @xmath plus–distributions, and the hard part
containing the polylogarithms. We then have:

-   For @xmath with @xmath there are no @xmath –terms in @xmath .

-   For @xmath we have @xmath and :

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (4.29)
      -- -------- -- --------

-   For @xmath we have @xmath and :

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (4.30)
      -- -------- -- --------

-   For @xmath we have @xmath and :

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (4.31)
      -- -------- -- --------

-   For @xmath we have @xmath and :

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (4.32)
      -- -------- -- --------

### 5 Higgs production at the LHC

The CERN proton–proton collider successfully started its operations in
2009 at a center–of–mass energy of 900 GeV and then really in 2010 but
at a reduced center of mass energy of 7 TeV [ 223 ] . It has been
running in physics mode for more than one year up until now and has
collected enough data to produce already interesting results. Indeed the
quest for the SM Higgs boson has began and some results have been
presented in Refs. [ 224 , 225 ] .

In order to distinguish between the current early run at 7 TeV and the
designed run at an energy close to 14 TeV, we will call the early 7 TeV
experiment as the @xmath for littler Hadron Collider. The @xmath will
also be sensitive to the SM Higgs particle and in particular be
competitive with the Tevatron experiment once the accumulated luminosity
will be at least of order 1 fb @xmath [ 223 , 210 , 226 , 227 ] .
However, with the present expectations, the Tevatron and presumably also
the @xmath will only be able to exclude the existence of the SM Higgs
particle in some given mass range. We will present in this section some
results for the @xmath energy and also for SM Higgs boson production at
the designed @xmath TeV LHC.

The situation at the @xmath is much in the same way as what has to be
carefully done at the Tevatron: both are hadron colliders which then
imply that the predictions are plagued with various theoretical
uncertainties. The exclusion of Higgs mass regions relies crucially on
the theoretical predictions for the production cross sections for the
Higgs signal as well as for the relevant SM backgrounds, and this was
discussed in detail in the last section. We remind the reader that the
main production channel at the Tevatron which were presented are the top
and bottom quark loops mediated gluon–gluon fusion mechanism @xmath [ 99
] with the Higgs decaying into @xmath pairs which lead to @xmath (with
@xmath ) final states [ 100 ] and the Higgs–strahlung processes @xmath
(with @xmath ) [ 119 ] with the subsequent @xmath and @xmath decays of
the Higgs and the associated gauge bosons.

At the @xmath , the Higgs–strahlung processes, as well as as other
production channels such as weak vector–boson fusion and associated
Higgs production with top quark pairs, have too small cross sections
and/or are plagued with too large QCD backgrounds. This implies that the
gluon–gluon fusion process with the Higgs boson decaying into @xmath ,
@xmath , where @xmath stands for charged leptons, neutrinos and
eventually also jets including @xmath –quark jets, and to a lesser
extent @xmath final states, will be mostly relevant. At a center of mass
energy @xmath TeV and with 1 fb @xmath of data, recent studies by the
ATLAS and CMS collaborations have shown that the mass range @xmath –190
GeV can be excluded at 95%CL if no Higgs signal is observed [ 226 , 227
] . This is the reason why we will only concentrate in this section in
the theoretical predictions in the gluon–gluon fusion production
channel.

We will reproduce the same line of arguments developed in section 4 and
presented in Ref. [ 94 ] . We present an analysis of the gluon–gluon
fusion production channel for SM Higgs production @xmath at the @xmath ,
beginning with the theoretical prediction for the Higgs production cross
sections, including all the relevant higher order QCD and electroweak
corrections. We then analyze the various uncertainties that affect them.
We show that the scale and PDF uncertainties, as well as the
non–negligible uncertainty due to the use of an effective approach in
the calculation of QCD and electroweak higher order corrections beyond
next–to–leading order, add up to @xmath –30% depending on the considered
Higgs mass range. If we compare with what has been obtained in section
4.5 for the Tevatron case, the total uncertainty at the @xmath is
significantly smaller than that obtained at the Tevatron, as a result of
smaller QCD radiative corrections and a better knowledge of the gluon
distribution function at the energies relevant at the @xmath .

We will also give some predictions for different center–of–mass
energies. Indeed the LHC commissionning group did think about running
the LHC at intermediate center–of–mass energies of 8, 9, 10 TeV before
the long shut–down of the accelerator in order to complete design
operations needed for the full–flegded 14 TeV LHC [ 223 ] . This has
been finally abandonned and the CERN accelerator will run at 7 TeV until
the one year shut–down for the design of the 14 TeV run [ 228 ] .
Nevertheless we will give the central cross sections predictions for
these intermediate energies, as well as a detailed analysis of the
gluon–gluon fusion production channel for the full–fledged LHC with
@xmath TeV. The main result that we obtain is that while the production
cross sections for the SM Higgs particle are higher at energies @xmath
–14 TeV compared to @xmath TeV, the overall theoretical uncertainties
affecting the predictions do not change much.

#### 5.1 The main channel at the lHC (or LHC at 7 TeV)

The hierarchy in the production channels for the SM Higgs boson at the
@xmath does not substantially change when compared to the situation at
the Tevatron collider presented in section 4 . The main production
channel remains the gluon–gluon fusion channel @xmath proceeding through
triangular top and bottom quark loops [ 99 ] and as stated in the
introduction of this section we will discard the analysis of the other
sub–dominant production channels, due to the fact that the @xmath
analysis is mostly relevant only in the gluon–gluon fusion channel. As
stated in the Tevatron analysis this process is known to be subject to
extremely large QCD radiative corrections [ 101 , 102 , 103 , 104 , 105
, 107 , 108 , 109 , 110 , 159 , 160 , 163 , 118 , 111 ] that can be
described by an associated @xmath –factor defined as the ratio of the
higher order (HO) to the LO cross sections, consistently evaluated with
the value of the strong coupling @xmath and the PDF taken at the
considered order, see Eq. 4.1 .

The NLO corrections in QCD are known both for infinite [ 101 , 102 , 103
, 104 ] and finite [ 105 ] loop quark masses and, at @xmath TeV, lead to
a @xmath –factor @xmath in the low Higgs mass range, if the central
scale of the cross section is chosen to be the Higgs mass. We remind the
reader that it has been shown in Ref. [ 105 ] that working in an
effective field theory (EFT) approach in which the top quark mass is
assumed to be infinite is a very good approximation for Higgs mass
values below the @xmath threshold @xmath , provided that the leading
order cross section contains the full @xmath and @xmath dependence. The
calculation of the NNLO contribution has then been done [ 107 , 108 ,
109 ] only in the EFT approach where @xmath and, at @xmath TeV, it leads
to a @xmath increase of the cross section with @xmath . The comparison
with the Tevatroon K–factors shows that the QCD corrections to @xmath at
@xmath TeV are thus smaller than the corresponding ones at the Tevatron
as the @xmath –factors in this case are @xmath and @xmath (with a
central scale equal to @xmath ). At the LHC with @xmath TeV, the @xmath
–factors are even smaller, @xmath and @xmath .

The NNLL resummation of soft gluons increases the cross section by
slightly less than 10% [ 110 , 111 ] and as in the Tevatron case and for
the same reasons, we do not include this effect and mimick the @xmath
increase by using as the central scale

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

We recall the reader that this central scale choice improves the
convergence of the perturbative series and is more appropriate to
describe the kinematics of the process [ 169 ] . We again also include
the electroweak corrections known exactly up to NLO [ 113 , 114 , 115 ,
116 , 117 ] and which contribute at the level of a few percent; there
are also small mixed NNLO QCD–electroweak effects which have been
calculated [ 118 ] in an effective approach valid for @xmath that are
also included in our calculation.

We use the same procedure described in 4.1 for the calculation of the
production cross sections ³⁸ ³⁸ 38 Other updates of the @xmath cross
section at the LHC can be found in Refs. [ 118 , 111 , 229 , 230 , 231 ,
203 ] . : we use the Fortran code HIGLU [ 153 ] with our modification in
order to include the complete NLO corrections for the top and bottom
quark loops and the NNLO corrections for the top loop in the infinite
mass limit; grids for the electroweak corrections are provided within
the code and we also implement the NNLO mixed QCD–EW corrections in our
calculation. The production cross sections are shown at the @xmath with
@xmath TeV in Fig. 29 for an updated value of the top quark mass @xmath
GeV ³⁹ ³⁹ 39 in accord with most predictions at the @xmath , see Ref. [
210 ] . and when the partonic cross section is folded with the NNLO
MSTW2008 public set of PDFs [ 128 ] . The renormalization and
factorization scales are fixed to the central values of Eq. 5.1 . Our
results published in Ref. [ 232 ] agree with those given in Refs. [ 118
, 111 ] and updated in Ref. [ 210 ] within a few percent.

As in the Tevatron calculation we also display in Fig. 29 for
completeness the cross sections for the three other Higgs production
channels at hadron colliders that we evaluate using the programs of Ref.
[ 153 ] :

1.  the Higgs–strahlung processes @xmath with @xmath that are known
    exactly up to NNLO in QCD [ 121 , 122 , 123 , 124 , 125 , 106 , 173
    , 174 , 126 ] and up to NLO for the electroweak corrections [ 127 ]
    ; they are evaluated at @xmath (the invariant mass of the @xmath
    system) for the central scale ⁴⁰ ⁴⁰ 40 Here, the QCD @xmath –factors
    are moderate, @xmath and the electroweak corrections reduce the
    cross section by an amount of @xmath . For the evaluation of the
    cross section, we have used the NLO code V2HV [ 153 ] in which we
    implemented these higher order contributions. Our results agree with
    those of Ref. [ 210 ] . ;

2.  the weak vector boson fusion channel @xmath evaluated at the scale
    @xmath (the momentum transfer at the gauge boson leg) in which only
    the NLO QCD corrections [ 136 , 137 , 106 ] have been included; the
    NNLO corrections have been found to be very small [ 177 , 178 ] and
    we omit the electroweak corrections [ 176 ] , as was done in the
    Tevatron calculation earlier;

3.  associated Higgs production with top quark pairs in which only the
    leading order order contribution is implemented but at a central
    scale @xmath , which is a good approximation at these energies as
    the NLO @xmath –factor is very close to unity [ 141 , 142 , 143 ,
    144 ] , see also Ref. [ 210 ] .

The hierarchy shows a small difference compared to that of the Tevatron,
as the vector boson fusion production channel becomes the second most
important production channel at the @xmath whereas it was next to the
Higgs–strahlung processes at the Tevatron. It is also demonstrated in
Fig. 29 that the @xmath process is by far dominating in the entire Higgs
mass range, with a cross section that is one to two orders of magnitudes
larger than in the other production channels. Table 4 displays the
values of the cross sections for the five Higgs production processes for
a selection of Higgs masses relevant at the @xmath .

#### 5.2 The scale uncertainty

In the calculation of production cross sections and kinematical
distributions at hadron colliders, as the perturbative series are
truncated and the results are available only at a given perturbative
order, there is a residual dependence of the observables on the
renormalization scale @xmath which defines the strong coupling constant
@xmath and on the factorization scale @xmath at which the matching
between the perturbative matrix elements calculation and the
non–perturbative parton distribution functions is performed. The
uncertainty due to the variation of these two scales is then viewed as
an estimate of the unknown (not yet calculated) higher–order terms and
is rather often the dominant source of theoretical uncertainties.

This picture has been sketched in section 4.2 and we will use the same
techniques for the estimation of this scale uncertainty induced by the
missing higher order terms. We start at the median scale @xmath for
which the central or “best” value of the cross section is obtained, and
we vary the two scales @xmath and @xmath within the intervall defined in
4.2 :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with the value of the constant @xmath to be chosen. The constant @xmath
is again chosen as to catch the NNLO central calculation with the (N)LO
scale uncertainty bandd ⁴¹ ⁴¹ 41 In the case of the @xmath process, the
maximal (minimal) cross sections at a given fixed order in perturbation
theory (in particular at NNLO) is obtained for the scale choices @xmath
; there is thus no relevant restriction to put on the intervall of
variation in practice and we will usually use the simplification @xmath
. . At the @xmath with @xmath TeV, at @xmath , the value @xmath is
enough as to catch the NNLO central prediction with the NLO uncertainty
band of @xmath . This result still nearly holds if we use the LO bands
to catch the NNLO central prediction, as the LO bands nearly touch the
NNLO central prediction.

Adopting the range

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath for the cross section @xmath , the scale variation displayed
in Fig. 30 as a function of @xmath is obtained; it is compared to a
variation with a factor @xmath . In the insert, we present the maximal
and minimal variations of @xmath compared to the central value. We can
see that for @xmath , a scale uncertainty of @xmath is obtained in the
low mass range, @xmath GeV, which decreases to the level of @xmath at
high masses, @xmath GeV. If the domain for scale variation were extended
to @xmath , the uncertainty band would have increased to @xmath in the
low Higgs mass range as shown in Fig. 30 . Using at the @xmath the value
@xmath instead of @xmath can be related to the fact that the higher
order QCD corrections in the gluon–gluon fusion process at the @xmath
are smaller than that of the Tevatron case where we have then used
@xmath and hence a larger domain for the scale variation.

#### 5.3 The PDF+@xmath uncertainty

The second major source of uncertainty in the Higgs production in the
gluon–gluon fusion at the @xmath is again related to the imprecise
determination of the parton distribution functions (PDFs), much in the
same way at the Tevatron. This uncertainty, as shown later, is even more
important at the @xmath as for high Higgs mass values it becomes the
largest uncertainty.

As discussed in the Tevatron case, see 4.3 , there exist many different
PDFs parametrizations on the market. We thus have different way to
estimate the PDF uncertainty on the total production cross section and
again we will summarize our lines of argument as in the Tevatron case.

The first method is the so–called Hessian method where, besides the best
fit PDF with which the central values of the cross sections are
evaluated, a set of @xmath PDF parameterizations is provided that
reflect the @xmath variation of all ( @xmath ) parameters that enter
into the global fit. These uncertainties are thus mostly due to the
experimental errors in the various data that are used in the fits.
Taking the NNLO public set provided by the MSTW collaboration [ 128 ,
199 ] for instance, the PDF uncertainty at the 90% CL that is obtained
at the @xmath for the NNLO @xmath cross section is shown (by the red
lines and red band) in Fig. 31 as a function of @xmath . For low Higgs
masses, the uncertainty is at the level of 5% but it increases to reach
the level of @xmath at high Higgs masses, @xmath GeV. If only the (more
optimistic) 68%CL errors are to be considered, the previous numbers have
to be divided by @xmath .

The thorough analysis conducted for the gluon–gluon Higgs production at
the Tevatron has demonstrated that these (Hessian) uncertainties are not
sufficient as they do not account for the theoretical assumptions
entering into the parametrizations of the PDFs and which explain why
there are so many different PDFs sets on the market. It is therefore
very difficult to estimate within a given set the uncertainties behind
these different assumptions. Nevertheless, an accurate determination of
the PDFs uncertainty requires that we take into account this spread
observed in the theoretical predictions using the different NNLO PDFs
sets that are available.

As stated in section 4.3 , one possible way to estimate this more
accurate uncertainty is to compare the results for the central values of
the cross section (and hence, using the best fit PDFs only) when using
the different NNLO sets of PDFs which involve, in principle, different
assumptions. We display in Fig. 32 the values of @xmath calculated with
our procedure when folding the partonic cross section with the gluon
densities that are predicted by the four PDF sets ⁴² ⁴² 42 We discard in
this analysis the two other major PDF collaborations on the market, the
CTEQ collaboration [ 145 ] and the NNPDF collaboration [ 201 ] as their
PDF sets were only provided at the NLO order in QCD when this analysis
has been done. We also point out that the analysis conducted in section
4.3 has shown that the MSTW and CTEQ parametrizations are very similar,
hence we could easily believe that this should be in much the same way
at the @xmath . It is worth mentioning that the NNPDF collaboration has
released an update during the final stage of the writing of the thesis,
which includes a NNLO PDFs set [ 233 ] . Their PDF fit is close to that
of the MSTW collaboration. that have parameterizations at NNLO: MSTW [
128 ] , JR 09 [ 150 ] , ABKM [ 147 ] and HERAPDF [ 149 ] . In the latter
case, two sets are provided: one with the value @xmath that is close to
the world average value [ 205 ] and the MSTW best–fit @xmath [ 128 ] ,
and one with the value @xmath used also in the ABKM set [ 147 ] , that
is close to the preferred values that one obtains using deep–inelastic
scattering data alone.

The Fig. 32 shows that there are significant differences bewteen the
various NNLO PDFs sets predictions. Indeed, while the differences in the
cross sections are moderate in the low Higgs mass range, being of the
order of 10% or less, there is a significant difference at higher Higgs
masses, @xmath ) for @xmath GeV. Even with the same @xmath input or
best–fit values, HERAPDF with @xmath and MSTW results are strikingly
different. For the large @xmath values, this discrepancy is mainly due
to the gluon densities at moderate to high Bjorken– @xmath values which
are less constrained by the data (in particular if the Tevatron high
@xmath jet data are not included as is the case of the ABKM and HERAPDF
sets).

We again encounter the same situation developed at the Tevatron and
discussed earlier. The comparison between the estimate using only one
PDF set with the usual Hessian method displayed in Fig. 31 and the
estimate comparing the central predictions with various NNLO PDF sets,
displayed in Fig. 32 , leads to very different uncertainty estimations.
That is why the inclusion of the uncertainty due to the value of @xmath
is crucial as pointed out in Refs. [ 94 , 232 ] and explained in details
in section 4.3 . If the reader reads carefully the legend of Fig. 32 he
will see that even within one PDF set, say the HERAPDF set, the value of
@xmath could change drastically depending on the PDF fit that is done.
Indeed this value is fitted altogether with the PDF, but the difference
in the value of @xmath alone is not enough to explain the striking
differences in the various predictions and we should think about the
differences in the shape of the gluon densities. We will then also use
this additionnal source of uncertainty in the case of the Higgs
production in gluon–gluon fusion at the @xmath .

We recall that we use the MSTW scheme [ 199 ] with

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.3)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

We have evaluated the 90% CL correlated PDF+ @xmath uncertainties and
the result is shown in Fig. 31 (green band and green lines) as a
function of @xmath . The uncertainties that we have obtained, as
displayed in Fig. 31 , are much larger than the uncertainties solely due
to the PDF Hessian errors. At low Higgs masses we even double the
uncertainty. Nevertheless, in much the same was as in the case of the
Tevatron predictions, we cannot yet reconcile MSTW and ABKM/HERAPDF
predictions, particularly at high Higgs masses. We then miss something
that would be able to explain the spread of the different PDF sets
predictions using only one PDF scheme.

We will thus consider, in addition to the correlated PDF+ @xmath
uncertainty, the one that comes from the theoretical uncertainty on the
value of the strong coupling constant, stemming from the truncation of
the perturbation series, the different heavy flavour scheme in the
various PDF collaborations, and so on. If we compare the world average
value for @xmath and the value obtained using only deep–inelastic
scattering data, the difference is significant. Considering this
additionnal source of uncertainty then helps to reconcile the different
Higgs production cross section predictions.

The MSTW collaboration estimates the theoretical uncertainty to be
@xmath [ 199 ] , which gives @xmath at most at NNLO. Using a fixed
@xmath NNLO grid with central PDFs given by the MSTW collaboration, with
@xmath values different from the best–fit value (in the range
0.107–0.127 with steps of 0.001 and which thus include the values @xmath
at NNLO), we have evaluated this uncertainty. Adding it in quadrature to
the PDF+ @xmath uncertainty, we obtain at the @xmath a total PDF+ @xmath
uncertainty of @xmath depending on the Higgs mass. At least for not too
heavy Higgs bosons, this larger uncertainty reconciles the MSTW and
ABKM/HERAPDF predictions ⁴³ ⁴³ 43 In order to be as much thorough as
possible, we could also take into account the effects due to the bottom
and charm quark masses on the PDFs. Indeed, a change in the fitted
masses for these quarks may affect the gluon splitting which in turn
alters the shape of the gluon–gluon luminosity in @xmath . We have
estimated quantitatively this effect by using the @xmath and @xmath
dependent MSTW PDFs [ 234 ] with @xmath GeV and @xmath GeV. In the case
of the charm quark, we obtain an approximate @xmath change at @xmath GeV
and at most @xmath change at @xmath GeV. In the case of the @xmath
–quark, the change is below the percent level. As we add in quadrature
these uncertainties to obtain the total PDF+ @xmath uncertainty, these
additionnal sources are totally negligible and will not be included in
the end. .

If we compare the situation at the @xmath with the results we obtained
in the Tevatron study in section 4.3 we see that for @xmath GeV we
obtain smaller uncertainties, approximately @xmath compared to the
@xmath –20% uncertainty of @xmath at the Tevatron. This is due to the
better control on the behavior of the gluon density at moderate– @xmath
values which are relevant for the @xmath compared to high– @xmath values
relevant for the Tevatron. In addition to this remark we point out the
fact that we required to extend @xmath to the value of @xmath in the
Tevatron study in order to reconcile MSTW prediction with that of ABKM.
This is nearly done at the @xmath with the much smaller value of @xmath
as estimated by the MSTW collaboration.

We again stress that this procedure is by no mean universal and unique.
If we compare to the results obtained with the use of the PDF4LHC
recommendation [ 151 ] , that is to take the 68%CL MSTW PDF+ @xmath band
and multiply it by a factor of two ⁴⁴ ⁴⁴ 44 More precisely the procedure
advocated by the PDF4LHC group is to use the envelop of MSTW,CTEQ and
NNPDF prediction at the NLO level, rescaled to the central NNLO MSTW
prediction. As argued in [ 210 ] this is equivalent to the procedure
outlined in the main text. we obtain a slightly larger uncertainty while
we obtained a comparable uncertainty in the Tevatron analysis. This is
not much a suprise as Fig. 32 displays a very large discrepency between
the various NNLO predictions that cannot be handled in a satisfactory
way by the PDF4LHC recommendation. Nevertheless we obtain similar
uncertainties, a situation which gives us some confidence in our way of
trying to handle the still pending PDF puzzle.

#### 5.4 Effective field theory approximation

The last source of theoretical uncertainties that we consider is the one
specific to the gluon–gluon fusion production channel, and that was
already discussed in section 4.4 in the case of the Tevatron collider.

Indeed, although NLO QCD and EW corrections for the @xmath cross section
are known precisely with no approximation, the calculation at the NNLO
order is done in an effective theory (EFT) approach where the particles
running in the loop are assumed to have an infinite mass, or more
precisely to have a much heavier mass than that of the produced Higgs
boson. We will thus take into account an uncertainty related to that
approximation, both for QCD and EW corrections.

At NLO in QCD, the approximation @xmath for the contribution of the top
quark in the loop is rather good for Higgs masses below the @xmath
threshold, @xmath GeV, in particular when the full quark mass dependence
of the leading order cross section @xmath is taken into account [ 105 ]
. At NNLO, this approximation for the top quark contribution seems also
to be accurate as studies of the effect of a finite @xmath value in
expansions of @xmath have shown a difference below the percent level
with respect to the EFT calculation for @xmath GeV [ 212 , 213 , 214 ,
215 ] . At the Tevatron this result was enough to keep us looking at the
uncertainty related to the finiteness of the top quark mass as the
results were derived in the interesting Higgs mass range of @xmath GeV
for the Tevatron experiments.

The situation at the @xmath is quite different: the ATLAS/CMS
experiments have been designed to look for the Higgs boson in its entire
mass range @xmath GeV ⁴⁵ ⁴⁵ 45 the upper bound should be in fact
approximately 800 GeV, related to the theoretical bounds on the SM Higgs
mass, see section 3.1 . which reduces at @xmath TeV to the mass range
@xmath GeV. The EFT approach should then definitely not be valid for
Higgs masses beyond the @xmath threshold, that is beyond @xmath GeV,
where the @xmath amplitude develops imaginary parts. This can be seen at
NLO where both the exact and the approximate results are known. We will
thus include an uncertainty related to the use of the EFT approach for
@xmath which is taken as the difference between @xmath and @xmath when
the exact top quark mass dependence is included in the LO cross section
and when this difference is rescaled with the relative magnitudes of the
NLO and NNLO @xmath –factors, i.e. @xmath .

In the left–hand side of Fig. 33 we display the difference between the
exact calculation and the EFT calculation, both at NLO and NNLO QCD
order, for @xmath TeV. As expected the difference is very small for
@xmath GeV where the EFT approach is very well motivated, and then
oscillate around the 2% level up to 400 GeV from which the error
increases very fast. For @xmath GeV we obtain an uncertainty larger that
5% and thus we cannot treat this uncertainty as being negligible in
contrast with the Tevatron analysis [ 94 ] .

The two other sources of uncertainty that enter in the EFT approach have
already been encountered in the Tevatron analysis. Indeed it is well
known that of course the EFT approximation is not valid at all for the
bottom quark loop in the gluon–gluon fusion as the bottom quark mass is
small. The omission of this contribution at LO leads to a @xmath
difference compared to the exact case. The inclusion of the bottom quark
loop actually decreases the cross section because of the significant
negative interference between the top and the bottom quark loops, the
contribution of the bottom quark loop itself being rather small.
Neglecting this contribution then actually overestimates the NLO (and
also the NNLO) cross section and this approximation cannot be taken into
account in the scale variation performed at NNLO because of the absence
of the top–bottom interference at NNLO.

In order to estimate the uncertainty due the missing @xmath –loop
contribution at NNLO, we simply follow the previous procedure for the
top quark: we assign an error on the NNLO QCD result which is
approximately the difference between the exact result @xmath and the
approximate result @xmath obtained at NLO but rescaled with the relative
magnitude of the @xmath –factors that one obtains at NLO and NNLO for
the top–loop, i.e. @xmath . This procedure is the one that has been used
in section 4.4 in the study of the EFT approach at the Tevatron
collider. This leads to the uncertainty on the @xmath at @xmath TeV that
is shown in the right–hand side of Fig. 33 . Below @xmath GeV where the
@xmath –loop plays an important role the uncertainty is not negligible,
reaching the order of @xmath . For Higgs mass above @xmath GeV the
uncertainty is below the percent level and thus completely negligible
especially in the view of the EFT uncertainty due to the top–loop
foreseen in the previous lines.

In addition to this missing loop uncertainty, there is some freedom in
the choice of the renormalization scheme for the @xmath –quark mass in
the @xmath amplitude: either the the on–shell scheme in which the pole
mass is @xmath GeV or the @xmath scheme in which the mass @xmath GeV is
adopted. This leads to a difference of @xmath in the @xmath –quark loop
contribution at NLO that we will take as an additional uncertainty due
to the scheme dependence. This scheme dependence will also be discussed
in part IV when dealing with MSSM @xmath Higgs production at the
Tevatron and the @xmath . Note that this cannot be taken into account
with the scheme dependence as these are two widely different scales: the
scheme dependence is probed around @xmath while the scheme dependence
can be actually probed around @xmath .

The last source of EFT uncertainties is the mixed QCD–EW corrections
that have been calculated at NNLO [ 118 ] in an EFT approach with @xmath
. Obviously this limit is not valid in practice as Higgs mass above 115
GeV are probed at hadron colliders. Some caution should be taken when
including this correction and we have made the choice to assign an
uncertainty that is of the same size as the contribution of this
correction itself, as in Refs. [ 94 , 232 ] and in section 4.4 ⁴⁶ ⁴⁶ 46
According to a discussion with C. Anastasiou we tend to somewhat
underestimate the quality of the approximation which may be valid, up to
a certain point, above the @xmath threesold. Nevertheless, in the view
of the smallness of this (still non–negligible) uncertainty, we decide
to stick to our procedure for the entire Higgs mass range. . This
uncertainty is comparable in size to the difference between the
electroweak correction calculated exactly at NLO [ 116 , 117 ] evaluated
in the partial factorization scheme, where the correction @xmath is
added to the QCD corrected cross section, and the EW corrections
calculated in the complete factorization scheme where the NNLO cross
section is multiplied by @xmath . This generates an additional
uncertainty of @xmath at most, nearly exactly the same as discussed in
section 4.4 for the Tevatron.

Adding the uncertainties from these three sources linearly, the
resulting overall uncertainty is displayed in Fig. 34 as a function of
@xmath . It amounts to @xmath in the low Higgs mass range, drops to the
level of @xmath in the mass range @xmath –400 GeV, and then increases to
reach the level of @xmath at 600 GeV, as a result of the bad @xmath
approximation for the top loop contribution. Since this is a pure
theoretical uncertainty with no statistical grounds, it should be added
linearly to the uncertainty from scale variation, as will be done in the
next subsection.

#### 5.5 Total uncertainy at 7 TeV

We have described in the previous subsection the different sources of
theoretical uncertainties affecting our prediction. The last task which
remains to be done is the final combination in order to obtain the
overall theoretical uncertainty on the @xmath production cross section
at the @xmath .

As discussed in section 4.5 and also in [ 95 ] , the uncertainty
associated to the PDFs(+ @xmath ) should be considered as a pure
theoretical uncertainty despite the fact that the fit is done on
experimental data using @xmath techniques. Indeed this is the only
reasonable way to handle the PDF puzzle, that is the very large
discrepency between the various predictions with the different NNLO PDFs
sets on the market. In this way we consider the different theoretical
assumptions in the determination of the parton densities, and consider
the PDF(+ @xmath ) uncertainty to have no statistical ground ⁴⁷ ⁴⁷ 47 In
statistical language, the PDF uncertainties should be considered as
having a flat prior, exactly like the scale uncertainty. A more
elaborated discussion can be found in [ 210 ] where the recommended
combination is that of the linear type. and not added in quadrature with
the scale uncertainty and the EFT uncertainty which are purely
theoretical beyond any doubts.

We will thus summarize the three possible ways to combine the various
uncertainties, that have been presented in Ref. [ 232 ] .

1.  The first procedure has been presented for the first time in [ 94 ]
    and has been used in the section 4.5 in order to obtain the total
    uncertainty at the Tevatron in the gluon–gluon fusion channel,
    taking into account the possible correlation between the scale and
    the PDFs (that are evaluated at a given factorization scale). We
    calculate the extremal cross sections regarding to the scale
    variation and then apply on this minimal/maximal cross section our
    evaluation of the PDF+ @xmath uncertainty, with the factorization
    and renormalization scales fixed at the values corresponding to the
    minimal and maximal cross sections with respect to scale variation
    ⁴⁸ ⁴⁸ 48 This procedure has been in fact already proposed, together
    with other possibilities which give similar results, in Ref. [ 189 ]
    where top quark pair production at hadron colliders was discussed. .
    We then add linearly the smaller EFT uncertainty to obtain the
    overall theoretical uncertainty on the central prediction. This
    procedure labeled as procedure “A” is our preferred way of handling
    with the total uncertainty.

2.  The second procedure, labeled as procedure “B”, is simply the linear
    addition of the scale, EFT/scheme and PDF+ @xmath uncertainties, as
    all of them are considered as pure theoretical uncertainties. This
    procedure is the one advocated by Ref. [ 210 ] . The final
    uncertainty that is obtained is in general slightly larger that what
    can be obtained with the procedure A described above.

3.  The third and last procedure labeled as procedure “C” is to consider
    the PDF uncertainty as being the spread of the four NNLO central
    predictions with the four NNLO PDFs sets, using the MSTW
    parametrization as the central set. Since the maximal cross section
    for @xmath is obtained with the MSTW parametrization and the minimal
    one with the ABKM set, as displayed in Fig. 32 , the total
    uncertainty on the production cross section will be on the one hand
    the linear addition of the scale and EFT uncertainties evaluated
    with the MSTW PDF set for the upper uncertainty, on the other hand
    the linear addition of the scale and EFT uncertainties evaluated
    with the ABKM PDF set for the lower uncertainty, adding the
    difference between the MSTW and the ABKM predictions.

The overall theoretical uncertainties on @xmath cross section at the 7
TeV @xmath that we obtain when using the three ways A, B, C of handling
with the final combination are displayed in Fig. 35 as a function of the
Higgs mass. With the procedure A, the uncertainty amounts to @xmath for
@xmath GeV, reduces to @xmath for @xmath GeV to reach the value @xmath
at @xmath GeV ⁴⁹ ⁴⁹ 49 Note that the overall uncertainty on @xmath at
the @xmath is significantly smaller than what has been obtained at the
Tevatron in section 4.5 and published in [ 94 ] , where the procedure A
for the combination has been used ( @xmath ). This is a result of the
reduction of both the scale and the PDF uncertainties at @xmath TeV
compared to @xmath TeV, because of the reduction of the QCD @xmath
–factors at the @xmath compared to the Tevatron and also because of the
gluon density itself which has a less uncertain behavior for not too
heavy Higgs bosons. . With the procedure B, that is when the various
sources of uncertainties are added linearly, the total uncertainty that
is obtained is nearly the same as in the case of the procedure A, but
slightly smaller (2 to 3%) for the upper uncertainty and slightly higher
for the lower uncertainty. We remind the reader that this procedure is
advocated by Ref. [ 210 ] ; the results obtained with the procedure A
are then reasonable. In the case of procedure C, as we use for the
central prediction of @xmath the MSTW PDF set, the upper uncertainty is
simply the sum of the scale and scheme uncertainties which add to less
than 20% in the entire Higgs mass and are thus much smaller (in
particular in the low Higgs mass range) than in procedures A and B. This
is a different story for the lower uncertainty as in addition to the
scale and EFT uncertainties we have to take into account the difference
between the MSTW and ABKM predictions.In this case, the overall
uncertainty is comparable to what is obtained using the procedures A and
B in the low Higgs mass range where the difference between MSTW and ABKM
is of the order of 10% and, hence, the Hessian MSTW PDF+ @xmath
uncertainty alone. It becomes much larger at higher @xmath values where
the difference between the MSTW and ABKM predictions becomes
significant. A significant example can be taken at @xmath GeV where an
uncertainty of @xmath is obtained in procedure C, compared to @xmath
using procedures A and B.

The results obtained in this section are summarized in Table 5 ⁵⁰ ⁵⁰ 50
An extended table for Higgs masses up to 1 TeV can be found in the
@xmath –fusion section of Ref. [ 210 ] . The full table has not been
displayed in this thesis as we want to insist on the fact that
predictions for Higgs mass above 600 GeV are irrelevant at the @xmath ,
as the center–of–mass energy and the luminosity are too small to obtain
a viable signal. . The @xmath production cross section for values of the
Higgs mass relevant at the @xmath with @xmath TeV are given together
with the uncertainties from scale variations, the PDF+ @xmath
uncertainty in the MSTW scheme and the uncertainty due the use of the
EFT approach beyond the NLO order. The combined uncertainties obtained
using the three procedures A, B and C proposed above are also given.

#### 5.6 LHC results at different center–of–mass energies

As stated in the introduction of this section, the LHC commissionning
group had thought about the idea of raising gradually the center–of–mass
energy at the LHC, by going from 7 TeV to 14 TeV through intermediate 8,
9, 10 TeV center–of–mass energies [ 223 ] in order to increase
significantly the luminosity beyond the 1 fb @xmath level without having
to change much the accelerator design. Even if this idea was abandoned
in the beginning of year 2011 [ 228 ] we will present some results
concerning these intermediate energies and then give a detailed analysis
of the case of the full–fledged LHC at @xmath TeV.

##### 5.6.1 The case of the @xmath with @xmath TeV

We use the same recipe for the calculation of the central predictions,
namely a calculation at NNLO order in QCD and EW corrections, with a
central scale @xmath , using the MSTW 2008 NNLO PDFs set. The results
for @xmath are displayed for @xmath and 10 TeV in Fig. 36 as a function
of @xmath . They are also available numerically in Table 6 for the
relevant Higgs mass values .

As shown in Fig. 36 , in the low Higgs mass range @xmath GeV the cross
section @xmath is approximately @xmath and 100% higher at, respectively,
@xmath and 10 TeV, compared to @xmath TeV. At higher Higgs masses,
@xmath GeV, the increase of the cross section is slightly larger as the
phase space available for the Higgs production is reduced at lower
energies.

It has been verified that the expectations for the theoretical
uncertainies does not change significantly between the @xmath at 7 TeV
and the intermediate 8, 9, 10 TeV center–of–mass energies. At most we
obtain a 2% decrease due to the better behaviour of the gluon density at
high Higgs masses. To a very good approximation, we can therefore view
the results of the scale, EFT and PDF+ @xmath uncertainties as well as
the final combination (in either procedure A, B or C) all given in Table
5 for the @xmath TeV case as being the same at the @xmath for the
intermediate @xmath TeV.

##### 5.6.2 The case of the designed LHC at @xmath TeV

We end this subsection with the case of the designed LHC, with @xmath
TeV. It is expected to collect at least @xmath fb @xmath of data, a
luminosity that should allow either to discover the SM Higgs boson or to
exclude its existence at 95%CL in its entire mass range @xmath GeV.

We use exactly the same outlines that were developed troughout this
section for the case of the @xmath at @xmath TeV. The results for the
gluon–gluon fusion Higgs production cross section at the LHC with @xmath
TeV are displayed in Figs. 37 (for the scale uncertainty), 38 for the
PDF+ @xmath uncertainty and 39 for the overall combination. The
numerical results can also be found in Table 7 .

The main differences are highlighted in the next points:

-   The scale uncertainty is estimated by varying @xmath and @xmath in
    the domain @xmath , as was the case for the @xmath at 7 TeV. The
    result does not significantly change when comparing to the @xmath
    case: we obtain a variation of approximately @xmath at low Higgs
    masses and nearly @xmath at high Higgs masses, as displayed in the
    left part of Fig. 37 .

-   The EFT/scheme uncertainty is almost exactly the same than at @xmath
    TeV, as its most important component enters as a multiplicative
    factor in the @xmath amplitude but is larger starting from @xmath
    GeV. This is exemplified in the right part of Fig. 37 .

-   The left part of Fig. 38 demonstrates that there is still a very
    large spread in the different predictions when folding the partonic
    @xmath cross section with the gluon luminosities given by the four
    NNLO PDFs sets available. The results obtained within the MSTW
    scheme for the 90%CL PDF, PDF+ @xmath and the combined PDF+ @xmath
    uncertainties are displayed in the right part of Fig. 38 . A
    slightly smaller PDF+ @xmath uncertainty than at the @xmath is
    obtained, of order 1 to @xmath , since lower Bjorken @xmath values
    are probed.

-   The overall uncertainty on @xmath displayed in Fig. 39 is more or
    less the same at 14 TeV than at 7 TeV in the low Higgs mass range,
    but is slightly smaller for heavier Higgs bosons. As an example, we
    obtain for @xmath GeV a total @xmath uncertainty at 14 TeV compared
    to @xmath at 7 TeV. We note that we have restricted to procedure A
    as we believe it is the most reasonable procedure as discussed in
    section 5.5 .

Table 7 which displays the cross sections together with the individual
and overall theoretical uncertainties for the Higgs masses relevant at
the LHC summarizes the results obtained at the full–fledged LHC with
@xmath TeV.

#### 5.7 Summary and outlook

In this section were presented the theoretical predictions for the
Standard Model Higgs boson production total cross section at the early
@xmath , that is the LHC at 7 TeV, in the gluon–gluon fusion @xmath that
is the main channel. We have assumed a central scale @xmath to be @xmath
and calculated the cross section up to NNLO in QCD and EW corrections.

We have then estimated the theoretical uncertainties associated to the
prediction: the scale uncertainty, the uncertainties from the PDF
parametrisation and the associated error on @xmath , as well as
uncertainties due to the use of the EFT approach for the mixed
QCD-electroweak radiative corrections and the @xmath -quark loop
contribution in the gluon–gluon fusion case. We have followed the recipe
proposed for the first time in the case of the Tevatron collider and
presented in section 4.5 for the combination of the different sources of
uncertainties. The results that we obtain in the case of the @xmath are
smaller than at the Tevatron, mainly because the QCD corrections are
smaller at the @xmath , the @xmath –factor beeing smaller. There is also
a better behaviour of the gluon density at the high Bjorken @xmath
values probed at the @xmath .

We have also given some predictions for the intermediate center–of–mass
energies @xmath TeV as well as for the full–fledged @xmath TeV LHC. The
total uncertainty is in all cases nearly the same as for the @xmath with
@xmath TeV.

We have finished the analysis of the production cross section. Before
the investigation of the consequences on the experimental results we
have to analyze the crucial Higgs decay branching ratios in the next
section.

### 6 Higgs decay branching ratios and the implication on Higgs searches
at hadron colliders

The last two sections have been devoted to the Higgs production itself,
following the main production channels at the Tevatron and @xmath
colliders. The focus has been on the total cross section regardless of
the Higgs decay channel. This section is then devoted to the crucial
study of the Higgs decay branching ratios, as the experiments are
looking for the traces of the Higgs boson in their detectors, which then
require that the Higgs decay chain has to be well understood.

We will first review the most important channels for experimental
searches at the Tevatron and the LHC. The main reference for this
subsection is Ref. [ 45 ] . We then discuss the theoretical
uncertainties affecting the Higgs decay branching ratios, that have not
been considerered in the experimental analyses [ 93 , 226 , 227 ] up
until now and is under active investigation in Ref. [ 210 , 232 ] .
Indeed, while the Higgs decays into lepton and gauge boson pairs are
well under control (as mainly small electroweak effects are involved),
the partial decays widths into quark pairs and gluons are plagued with
uncertainties that are mainly due to the imperfect knowledge of the
bottom and charm quark masses and the value of the strong coupling
constant @xmath . This was first studied in Ref. [ 235 ] and the
analysis presented in Ref. [ 232 ] was an update of this previous
result, and will be the subject of this section. We show that at least
in the intermediate mass range, @xmath –150 GeV, where the SM Higgs
decay rates into @xmath and @xmath final states have the same order of
magnitude, the parametric uncertainties on these two main Higgs decay
branching ratios are non–negligible, being of the order of 3 to 10% at
the @xmath level.

#### 6.1 Important channels for experimental search

We present in this subsection the main channels used at the Tevatron and
the LHC for the experimental searches of the SM Higgs boson. We display
in Fig. 40 the decay pattern on the Higgs mass range that is relevant
for the current search at the Tevatron and in particular at the LHC,
which will illustrate the comments that follow for each important decay
mode. We already point out that the reader can find most of the
information relative to the LHC case in Refs. [ 236 , 237 , 238 ] which
summurize all the efforts made by the two major ATLAS and CMS
collaborations.

##### 6.1.1 @xmath channel

The partial width of the decay of the Higgs boson into quark pairs is
given at LO in QCD by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

Eq. 6.1 then shows that the partial width is proportionnal to the square
of the quark mass for not too light Higgs masses, which means that the
dominant channel will be for the bottom quark. This partial width
receives large NLO QCD corrections, and the quark mass has to be taken
in the @xmath renormalization scheme in order to absorb large logarithms
corrections. We refer the reader to Ref. [ 45 ] , page 39. In Refs. [
239 , 240 ] the NNLO QCD corrections have been calculated as well as the
three-loops @xmath in Refs. [ 241 , 242 ] .

The decay of the SM Higgs boson in quark pairs is one of the most
important channels for experimental searches in particular for the
bottom quark. This is the dominant mode for light Higgs masses @xmath
GeV at the Tevatron through the Higgs production in the Higgs–strahlung
channel @xmath with @xmath being either a @xmath or a @xmath boson [ 243
] .

This mode is the golden mode at the Tevatron for the low Higgs mass
searches, with @xmath , @xmath and @xmath final states where the
requirements of isolated leptons and missing energy help to reduce the
background. The use of @xmath –tagging techniques crucially improves the
signal–over–background ratio and is used along with neural network
techniques for the signal reconstruction and the rejection of @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath backgrounds, see Ref. [ 244 ] and Ref. [ 244 ] (page
69).

The situation at the LHC is nos as good as the QCD background is far too
large. Only with a luminosity of order 30 fb @xmath at the full–fledged
LHC we may obtain a 3 @xmath evidence at @xmath GeV [ 245 , 246 ] . This
decay mode also exists in association with a SM Higgs production through
associated top quark production @xmath and can improve the LHC search,
but this require a very challenging @xmath –tagging with four bottom
quarks in the final state. A clear evidence is beyond the reach of the
@xmath at 7 TeV and require a luminosity greater than 100 fb @xmath at
the LHC to claim a discovery with only this channel [ 247 , 248 , 249 ,
250 ] .

##### 6.1.2 @xmath channel

As displayed in Fig. 40 the Higgs decay channels involving a pair of
weak bosons are the dominant channels for Higgs mass above @xmath GeV.
These channels are thus of utmost importance both at the Tevatron and
the LHC colliders.

We should distinguish between two regimes: either above the @xmath and
@xmath threesold where both weak bosons are real and then follow their
own decay chains, or below the threesold where we have off–shell weak
bosons and thus three and four–body decays. The partial width for for
the @xmath with boths @xmath bosons being on–shell is given at LO by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

The symmetry factor @xmath is either @xmath or @xmath . We see that for
very heavy Higgs bosons we have @xmath which means, this channel being
largely dominant, that @xmath for very heavy Higgs bosons. It implies
that considering the Higgs boson still as a particule is far from
obvious given that its width is comparable to its mass.

In order to obtain the decay width where the two weak bosons are
off–shell we have to take into account the total decay width of the weak
bosons through a Breit–Wigner modelisation and use Eq. 6.2 with general
@xmath and @xmath momentum. It then has the expression given in Ref. [
251 ] :

  -- -------- -------- -- --
     @xmath               
              @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- --

with @xmath being given by Eq. 6.2 but with @xmath and @xmath . NLO
corrections have been calculated in Refs. [ 252 , 253 , 254 , 255 , 256
, 257 , 258 ] as well as higher order corrections up to NNLO [ 259 ]
that are summarized in Ref. [ 45 ] page 58.

Higgs seaches through these decay channels are very powerful, using
either the gluon–gluon fusion production mode, the vector boson fusion
mode or the Higgs–strahlung processes:

1.  @xmath : the Higgs decaying into a pair of @xmath bosons is very
    promising when the Higgs has been produded in the gluon–gluon fusion
    channel or the Higgs–strahlung process @xmath . The channel @xmath
    is the most powerful channel at the Tevatron for high Higgs masses
    @xmath GeV searches and very promising at the LHC even at low Higgs
    masses around @xmath GeV, see Refs. [ 260 , 238 ] . We have to know
    very precisely the @xmath and @xmath backgrounds as well as top
    quark pair production in order to observe a clear excess of events
    in the distributions. Spin correlation and suitable cuts help to
    improve the significance. The process @xmath at the Tevatron is not
    very useful as the production cross section is too small. It is more
    promising at the LHC for Higgs masses between @xmath GeV and @xmath
    GeV, see Ref. [ 45 ] page 122. Finally the WW/ZZ fusion followed by
    the @xmath decay is very useful at the LHC with the jet veto
    techniques. A @xmath evidence in this channel can be obtained with a
    luminosity of order 30 fb @xmath , see Ref. [ 261 ] .

2.  @xmath : in association with the Higgs boson production through
    gluon–gluon fusion, this is the golden channel for high Higgs mass
    searches @xmath both at the Tevatron and the LHC [ 262 , 263 , 264 ]
    , where in the latter case a discovery can already be claimed for a
    Higg mass @xmath GeV with a 5 fb @xmath luminosity [ 238 ] , and
    with a 8 fb @xmath luminosity in the CMS detector on the entire high
    mass range (except for @xmath GeV where 100 fb @xmath in this
    channel is needed), see Ref. [ 236 ] . The main background is the
    @xmath production which can be removed with a side–bands study and
    the interpolated in the signal region. This channel is not useful
    with other production channels because of the smallness of the
    production cross section and the very high backgrounds.

##### 6.1.3 @xmath channel

The @xmath channel as well as the @xmath decay process that will be
discussed below are loop–induced processes. These processes are known up
to NNLO in EW corrections and NNLO in QCD corrections in the infinite
quark mass limit in the loops, see page 58 of Ref. [ 45 ] . The
expression for the LO partial decay widths are similar to what has been
obtained for the @xmath production channel with the same functions
@xmath and @xmath involved, see Eq. 4.8 :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath for the quarks, @xmath for the leptons, @xmath being the
electric charge of the fermion @xmath and @xmath as the form factor

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This decay channel is the best mode for light Higgs mass searches @xmath
GeV at the LHC [ 265 , 266 , 267 , 268 , 269 ] , and has been used in
Tevatron experimental analyses for @xmath GeV but as a sub–dominant
channel and only to improve the efficiency of the experimental programm
with multivariate techniques. Even if the branching fraction is small as
can be seen in Fig. 40 , its very clean final state compensate the
trickiness of the analyses. Both @xmath and @xmath production channels
are used even if the former is not as useful as the latter. The
backgrounds are similar in both cases. The QCD background from jets that
fake photons is huge and require a very efficient triggering of the
electromagnetic calorimeters of ATLAS and CMS detectors. These
backgrounds can be determined by the measurements of the side–bands in
the invariant di–photon mass distribution. Nevertheless this channel
require a large amount of data as a small bump in the di–photon mass
distribution is searched.

At low luminosities the combination of all production channels is
required: @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath will enhance the
statistics and we may then have a @xmath discovery though this decay
mode with a luminosity of order 30 fb @xmath and already a 3 @xmath
evidence for @xmath fb @xmath [ 238 ] .

##### 6.1.4 A comment on the @xmath channel

The @xmath channel will be discussed in the following subsection, even
if it adds little to the experimental searches. We just mention that the
theoretical predictions follow a very similar recipe compared to that of
the di–photon decay channel presented above. We have at LO:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

We will discuss in brief this channel when dealing with the
uncertainties that affect its branching fraction. The QCD corrections
are known up to @xmath order in the infinite top mass approximation, see
Ref. [ 270 ] .

##### 6.1.5 @xmath channel

The last important decay channel for experimental searches is the only
leptonic channel that is not swamped by the other decay channels. The
partial width at LO is given in Eq. 6.1 where we replace @xmath by
@xmath and divide the result by the factor of 3, as the tau lepton has
no color factor. The NLO and NNLO corrections follow what has been
presented in the @xmath subsubsection above.

The production channel which allows for a search in this decay mode is
at first look only the vector boson fusion @xmath process. It has been
considered in particular in LHC analyses for the intermediate Higgs mass
@xmath range [ 271 ] (page 56), where for a luminosity of order 30 fb
@xmath a @xmath combined statistical significance can be obtained when
considering all possible decay products of the @xmath ’s. The major
backgrounds are found to be QCD production @xmath with the @xmath boson
decaying into a di– @xmath pair. This can be measured in the side–bands
of the invariant mass distribution of the lepton pair and then
extrapolated in the signal region.

In the section 13.4 of this thesis we will present a possible new way
for the use of this decay channel in association with gluon–gluon fusion
Higgs production.

#### 6.2 Uncertainties on the branching ratios

The sections 4 and 5 have introduced the detailed analysis of the
theoretical uncertainties affecting the production channels for the SM
Higgs boson. We need to perform the same investigation when dealing with
the Higgs decay branching ratios in order to obtain in the end a
combined cross section times branching ratios analysis with all sources
of theoretical uncertainties taken into account.

##### 6.2.1 The parametric uncertainties

An analysis of the uncertainties affecting the Higgs branching ratios
has been performed long ago in Ref. [ 235 ] . This section, based on the
results published in Ref. [ 232 ] , update the earlier results by taking
into account the parametric uncertainties on the value of the strong
coupling constant @xmath as well as the value of the bottom quark and
charm quark masses. These uncertainties are taken as being experimental
which means that we will not take into account the theoretical
uncertainty on the value of @xmath in this analysis, mainly because the
impact would be negligible in the view of the final combination of the
uncertainties on the branching fractions. As we consider these
uncertainties as experimental they have a statistical ground, and we
will choose to stick at the 68%CL (i.e. 1 @xmath level) for the choice
of the error interval.

We will then use this following recipe:

1.  The strong coupling constant @xmath plays a very important role
    either at LO for the @xmath channel or beyond LO when dealing with
    the QCD corrections; the uncertainty will be thus significant on the
    branching ratios. We adopt for consistency reasons the same value
    that we have used for the determination of the central predictions
    for the production cross section in the former sections: @xmath at
    NNLO at the 68%CL.

2.  In Ref. [ 232 ] we used @xmath masses evaluated at the mass itself
    as starting points for the @xmath and @xmath quarks, with the
    central values and the uncertainties taken directly from Ref. [ 205
    ] ⁵¹ ⁵¹ 51 with these starting inputs and the value of @xmath given
    in point a), the central values of the @xmath pole masses are @xmath
    GeV and @xmath GeV using a 2–loops calculation with variation ranges
    of, respectively, 4.64–4.90 GeV and 1.42–1.63 GeV. For the pole
    bottom–quark mass, the central value is rather close to the one
    adopted in the MSTW scheme for parameterizing the parton densities [
    128 ] , @xmath GeV, and it was expected that the difference would
    have no practical impact . Their uncertainties were larger than
    those considered in Ref. [ 272 ] with quite the same central values.
    In a recent discussion within the LHC Higgs Cross Section Working
    Group a new agreement has been reached and the results presented in
    the following will use @xmath GeV and @xmath GeV, which then
    transform into pole masses @xmath GeV and @xmath GeV with a 1--loop
    calculation ⁵² ⁵² 52 We greatly thank A. Singer for having clarified
    the discussion about the final values to be taken. , as the
    parameters in Ref. [ 205 ] were seen to be too conservative on the
    one side, the parameters in Ref. [ 272 ] being seen a little too
    optimistic on the other side. When we will quote separately the
    impact of these uncertainties on the Higgs branching ratio, we will
    assume the central value @xmath at NNLO for the strong coupling
    constant ⁵³ ⁵³ 53 We thank M. Spira for having clarified the link
    between the order at which the transformation from @xmath masses to
    pole masses is done and the correlation between @xmath and the
    uncertainties on the quark masses. .

3.  For the @xmath channel we will consider only the parametric
    uncertainties quoted above. At NNLO, the pure theoretical scale
    uncertainty is of the order 10% but since the branching ratio is
    small it migrates into an error of less than 1%. In addition, the N
    @xmath LO contribution would reduce this scale variation to the
    level of a few percent at most and this uncertainty can be safely
    neglected. The same analysis can be done for the other channel that
    we will consider in the following, meaning that the scale variation
    uncertainties will be neglected in the rest of the section.

All these three points mentioned above and in particular the last point
c) are dependant on the interval of variation for the Higgs mass. Indeed
for @xmath GeV the @xmath opens up, as displayed in Fig. 40 . We should
then perform a detailed analysis of this channel for these high mass
regime and in particular take into account the scale variation.
Nevertheless this channel might play a role only for Higgs masses
greater than @xmath GeV, where we reach the possibility of the @xmath at
7 TeV, not to mention the Tevatron experiments. This is why its analysis
has been totally discarded in this thesis.

##### 6.2.2 The final uncertainties on the branching ratios

In order to calculate the central values for the branching ratios
together with the associated uncertainties we use the latest version
3.80 of the program HDECAY [ 97 ] available, which calculates the
partial and total Higgs decay widths including the relevant QCD and
electroweak higher order corrections. It is worth mentioning that the
version used in Ref. [ 232 ] was older: the results presented in this
section are then an update of the previous results published in this
latter reference. We will use the parameters discussed above and add in
quadrature the final errors that we obtain in order to present the total
uncertainties on the different branching ratios considered. We stress
that the result we obtain are very similar to those presented in Ref. [
232 ] in the crucial decay channels that are the @xmath and @xmath
modes. Thus the conclusion of Ref. [ 232 ] remains globally unchanged.

We obtain the branching ratios (BR) shown in Fig. 41 as a function of
the Higgs mass, including the total uncertainty bands. We present in
Table 8 the branching ratios for the main decay modes @xmath and @xmath
, for selected values of the Higgs mass, @xmath and 150 GeV, together
with the individual and total uncertainties. The uncertainties (in
percentage) on the branching ratios for the @xmath and @xmath channels
are the same as those affecting the @xmath mode. In Table 9 , we display
the branching ratios for the various decays as well as their
corresponding total uncertainties for a selection of Higgs masses that
are relevant for the @xmath and the Tevatron colliders. Fig. 41 displays
the branching ratios for Higgs mass up to @xmath GeV. The numbers above
this mass are not useful as the uncertainties for the only relevant
channels, that are the @xmath and @xmath modes, drop to the level of 0%.
We will thus not include the values for Higgs mass above 200 GeV and up
to @xmath GeV in Table 9 but they are of course available on demand.

The largest total errors are by far the ones that affect BR( @xmath
which are of the order of 8%. In contrast the errors on BR @xmath are at
the level of a few to 5% at most and the errors in the @xmath channel do
not exceed 3%. In the case of the @xmath channel, it is mainly due to
the uncertainty on the input charm–quark mass @xmath and, to a lesser
extent, to the uncertainty on @xmath ; their combination leads to a very
strong variation of the charm–quark mass at the high scale @xmath ,
@xmath . For the @xmath channel the uncertainty is mainly due to the
uncertainty on @xmath , and in both cases, the error on the input @xmath
–quark mass leads to a 3% uncertainty at most. Nevertheless, since the
branching ratios for these two decays are small, at most a few percent
in the Higgs mass range of interest, the associated uncertainties will
affect the Higgs total width, and hence the branching ratios for the
other decay channels, in a less significant way.

The uncertainty on the @xmath decay channel that is the most important
channel at the Tevatron for low Higgs mass searches, depends strongly on
the considered Higgs mass range. For @xmath GeV where the branching
ratio is BR @xmath and thus largely the dominant channel, the
uncertainty is less than a percent, reaching the percent level at @xmath
GeV. This is mainly due to the fact that as the channel is dominant, the
@xmath partial width is the major component of the total width and the
errors partly cancel in the branching ratio. There is, however, a
residual error coming from the input bottom mass and to a lesser extent
@xmath and the charm mass errors. This is also exemplified by the
comparison between the results presented in this section and the former
results of Ref. [ 232 ] where the errors on the input bottom mass where
larger: we see that the errors on the branching fractions where also
correspondingly larger.

In the mass range @xmath –150 GeV, the partial widths for @xmath and
@xmath decays have the same magnitude (we reach the crossing region of
the two decay modes) and the two branching ratios have larger
uncertainties. The uncertainty on BR @xmath increases from 1% at @xmath
GeV to approximately 3%, that is the triple, at @xmath GeV. At the same
time, the uncertainty on BR @xmath , which is the same as the one on BR(
@xmath and BR( @xmath , drops from @xmath at @xmath GeV to @xmath at
@xmath GeV. In this case @xmath has nearly no impact as BR @xmath is
small. For higher Higgs masses, @xmath GeV, the Higgs width is mainly
controlled by the @xmath decay and then jointly with @xmath for @xmath .
The uncertainty on the branching ratio BR @xmath drops to nearly 0%. The
uncertainty on BR @xmath remains at the 8% level but this has no impact
as the branching ratio is far too small to be relevant.

For Higgs masses beyond @xmath GeV, the decay channel @xmath opens up
and has a branching ratio of @xmath at @xmath GeV dropping to less than
@xmath for @xmath GeV or @xmath GeV. It will be affected by the
uncertainties on @xmath as well as by some electroweak contributions
from the Higgs self–couplings. This leads to a total uncertainty that is
estimated to be below the 5% level [ 210 ] , which translates to an
uncertainty of less than 1% in the branching ratios for the important
decays @xmath .

Thus, the uncertainties on the important Higgs branching ratios BR(
@xmath as well as BR( @xmath can be significant in the intermediate mass
range @xmath –150 GeV where the @xmath and @xmath decays are competing
with each other. Even if the uncertainty remains reasonable in this new
analysis, at most 8%, this should be taken into account in experimental
analyses. We also see that the conclusions remain the same as in Ref. [
232 ] even if the uncertainties have been reduced by a factor of 2.

#### 6.3 Combination at the Tevatron

The section 6.2 above has introduced the branching ratios together with
their uncertainties that are of parametric nature and have thus be
combined with a quadratic addition. We need in the end to combine both
the production cross section and the branching fractions in order to
obtain a complete prediction for each specific search channel.

This combination is in general complicated to perform when several
production and decay channels are involved. Unfortunately that is the
case at the Tevatron where both @xmath and @xmath production channels on
the one hand, both @xmath and @xmath on the other hand have to be
considered especially in the intermediate mass range @xmath GeV. In
addition to this difficulty we should also take into account two
important issues:

1.  The total Higgs decay width becomes large at high Higgs masses and
    thus should be taken into account in the processes @xmath where the
    narrow width approximation for the Higgs boson propagator fails.

2.  We should take into account interferences between the signal and
    background, as for example in @xmath and @xmath .

These two issues will not be addressed in this thesis, and we refer the
reader to a work in progress [ 273 ] . We also note that there are
anti–correlations between the different decay rates as the sum of all
branching ratios is equal to unity.

Combining the uncertainty in the production rate and the uncertainty in
the Higgs decay branching ratios is then not obvious at all. We should
also think about the diffence between the pure theoretical uncertainties
considered in the case of the production cross sections and the
uncertainties on the branching ratios which (mainly) come from
experimental errors on the input parameters @xmath and the quark masses.
In statistical language this means that we should make a combination of
a flat prior uncertainty and a gaussian prior uncertainty. In addition,
there is one parameter which is common in the calculation of the
branching ratios and the production cross sections: the coupling @xmath
. The uncertainty on @xmath will affect at the same time @xmath and BR(
@xmath ; it occurs that in both the Higgs production and in Higgs decays
the minimal (maximal) values are obtained with the minimal (maximal)
value of @xmath when the error @xmath is included.

We will then adopt a simple method that is a linear addition of the
errors on the Higgs branching ratios to the theoretical uncertainties on
the production cross section, keeping in mind that if there are
anti–correlations between the production and the decay chain the related
uncertainty should nearly vanish. For consistency reason we should
increase the uncertainty due to the experimental errors on the strong
coupling constant @xmath in the branching ratios as in the production
cross sections we have taken the @xmath CL PDF+ @xmath uncertainty. We
will present results for the two main search channels @xmath followed by
@xmath decay and @xmath through gluon–gluon fusion followed by @xmath
decay. In the intermediate Higgs mass range the two decay compete each
other. The combination of the two channels should then take into account
the correlations between the two decay channels on the one hand, and
should also take into account the relative importance of the two
production channels on the other hand. We thus have a mean with
anti–correlated uncertainties on the @xmath –quark mass between the two
decay chains. The final result will be used in section 6.5 in order to
compare with the experimental results [ 91 , 92 , 93 ] .

The results for @xmath and @xmath are displayed in Fig. 42 as a function
of the relevant Higgs masses at the Tevatron, together with the total
uncertainty when taking into account that on the branching ratio. The
left of Fig. 42 shows the result for the dominant search channel for low
Higgs masses in the @xmath decay channel. It is then demonstrated that
the uncertainties on the branching ratio are really sizeable and have to
be taken into account. They add @xmath total uncertainty to be compared
to the @xmath uncertainty on the production cross section alone. We note
that the total @xmath plays no role at all above @xmath GeV as the total
cross section times branching ratio tends to the null value.

The right of Fig. 42 shows the main channel for high Higgs masses
searches in the @xmath channel, including the total uncertainty with or
without those of the branching ratio included. The effect of the total
uncertainty on the branching ratio is only visible in the region @xmath
–150 GeV where the errors on BR @xmath , dominated in practice by the
errors in the decay channel @xmath , is significant. Above the @xmath
threshold, the branching ratio uncertainty is nearly null which means
that it has no effect in the Higgs mass range @xmath –180 GeV to which
both the Tevatron and the @xmath are most sensitive.

The net result is that even if the uncertainties on the branching ratios
play no role in the range where the Tevatron experiment is the most
sensitive, that is the range @xmath GeV, they have to be taken into
account for @xmath GeV in both the @xmath and @xmath channels.

#### 6.4 Combination at the LHC

The situation at the @xmath and even at the LHC with @xmath TeV the
situation is much simpler compared to that of the Tevatron. Indeed only
the @xmath production channel is to be considered in practice, only the
decays @xmath and to a lesser extent @xmath are relevant. Since we have
considered only the dominant QCD uncertainties, these decays are
affected by the same uncertainties as discussed in previous section 6.2
and displayed in the last column of Table 9 .

In this case, we obtain the combined uncertainty of @xmath at the @xmath
that is displayed in Fig. 43 in the case of the @xmath decay as a
function of @xmath . Besides the uncertainty on the cross section which
is shown by the dashed lines, we display the effect of adding the error
on the @xmath branching ratio as shown by the full lines which slightly
increase the overall uncertainty. As expected this is only visible in
the region where the uncertainties are sizeable for @xmath GeV where the
uncertainty on the branching fraction is in practice dominated by the
uncertainty on the partial decay width @xmath . Above the WW threesold
the uncertainty drops to the null value, meaning that in particular
there is no need to consider this uncertainty in the high Higgs mass
regime, as seen above in the case of the Tevatron colliders. However as
already stated the total Higgs width as well as the interference between
the signal and the background become significant at high masses and
should be taken into account in both the production cross section and
the decay widths [ 210 ] .

In the case of the @xmath (and @xmath decays, since the errors on the
branching ratios are the same as those affecting BR( @xmath , the
overall uncertainties in @xmath can also be seen from Fig. 43 : only the
normalization of the branching ratio is different and can be obtained
for a specific decay mode from Table 9 .

#### 6.5 The Tevatron exclusion limit

After having calculated the production cross sections together with
their theoretical uncertainties in section 4 at the Tevatron, the
branching ratios that are relevant in section 6.2 and made the
combination in section 6.3 , we are now ready to compare with the
experimental results given by the CDF and D0 collaborations [ 90 , 91 ,
92 , 93 ] .

The comparison with low mass Higgs seaches results shows that while the
Tevatron collaborations use an approximate 5% uncertainty on the main
search channel @xmath , we have found a total uncertainty of nearly 15%
taking into account all possible sources of uncertainties. In particular
the uncertainties on the branching fractions are sizeable and add up to
nearly 5%, when this has been overlooked by experimental collaborations.
Nevertheless, it does not change significantly the main result on the
95%CL exclusion for the SM Higgs boson mass in the @xmath GeV mass
range.

The situation in the high Higgs mass range is completely different. This
is the key range at the Tevatron as the experiments are the most
sensitive for Higgs mass @xmath GeV: indeed, the CDF and D0 experiments
claim that they exclude a SM Higgs boson at 95%CL for @xmath GeV. In
section 4.5 we have found a total uncertainty of order @xmath , to be
compared with the nearly @xmath used by the experimental collaborations.
This has to be analyzed in detail to see wether it has an impact on the
exclusions bounds [ 91 , 92 , 93 ] . In addition we should add the
uncertainties on the branching ratios, but as can be seen on Fig. 42
they have no impact for @xmath GeV. In the intermediate Higgs mass range
@xmath GeV where both search channels @xmath and @xmath compete each
other, the uncertainties on the two branching ratios have to be taken
into account.

We display in Fig. 44 the comparison between our calculation on the
production cross section and the CDF/D0 expectations on the one hand,
the prediction using the way of handling the theoretical uncertainties
described in Ref. [ 210 ] on the other hand. The CDF and D0 experiments
simply add in quadrature the uncertainties from the scale variation and
the PDF+ @xmath uncertainties obtained through the Hessian method and
ignore the smaller EFT uncertainty. They obtain an overall uncertainty
of order 20% on the inclusive cross section. As stated in the former
section, see section 4.5 , we believe that this is not reasonable and
has little justification. Indeed, the uncertainties associated to the
PDFs in a given scheme should be viewed as purely theoretical
uncertainties (due to the theoretical assumptions in the
parameterization) despite of the fact that they are presented as the
@xmath or more departure from the central values of the data included in
the PDF fits. They should be equivalent to the spread of the different
predictions when use the four NNLO PDFs sets available on the market and
thus having no statistical interpretation ⁵⁴ ⁵⁴ 54 If we want to use a
stasticial analysis we then should use a flat prior and not a gaussian
prior to handle the PDF puzzle. and thus combined linearly with the
uncertainties from the scale variation and the EFT approach which are
pure theoretical uncertainties. This is the procedure recommended, for
instance, by the LHC Higgs Cross Section Working Group [ 210 ] that is
also displayed in Fig. 44 . Our procedure has been proposed first in
Ref. [ 94 ] where we apply the combined PDF– @xmath uncertainties
directly on the maximal/minimal cross sections with respect to scale
variation ⁵⁵ ⁵⁵ 55 We remind the reader that a similar procedure has
also been advocated in Ref. [ 189 ] for top quark pair production. , and
then adds linearly the small uncertainty from the EFT approach. This
last procedure, that we have used here, provides an overall uncertainty
that is similar (but slightly smaller) to that obtained with the linear
sum of all uncertainties.

In the mass range @xmath GeV with almost the best sensitivity, our
procedure gives an approximate @xmath total uncertainty, to be compared
to the @xmath and @xmath uncertainties assumed, respectively, by the CDF
and D0 collaborations. The comparison with the LHC Higgs cross section
working group recommendation use the uncertainties from scale ( @xmath
on the sum of the jet cross sections ⁵⁶ ⁵⁶ 56 An additional uncertainty
of @xmath from jet acceptance is introduced when considering the
Higgs+jet cross sections. We will consider it to be experimental and,
when added in quadrature to others, it will have little impact. and PDFs
( @xmath when the MSTW 68% CL PDF+ @xmath error is multiplied by a
factor of two following the PDF4LHC recommendation) [ 151 ] , leading to
a total of @xmath for @xmath GeV. Thus, the uncertainty that we assume
is comparable to the one obtained using the LHC procedure [ 210 ] , the
difference being simply due to the additional @xmath uncertainty from
the use of the EFT approach that we also include. In the end this
demonstrates that our total uncertainty is certainly not too
conservative and then has to be taken seriously.

We display in Fig. 45 the comparison between the experimental results
presented in Refs. [ 91 , 92 , 93 ] and our theoretical expectations.
This presentation is of course naive, as the true combination of the
different channel is very difficult, given the fact that many channels
are involved. Nevertheless we know in practice that two channels only
matter at the Tevatron, that are the @xmath after Higgs–strahlung
production for low Higgs mass searches and the @xmath channel after
gluon–gluon fusion Higgs production for high Higgs mass searches. We pay
a particular attention in the intermediate Higgs mass range where both
channel are to be considered, and we take into account the correlation
between the two decay channel.

If we want to claim a 95%CL exclusion we should require that the
observed line be below the lower band of the SM prediction. That is not
the case when we compare with our prediction, thus we believe that the
Tevatron experiment have not excluded the SM Higgs boson in the Higgs
mass range @xmath GeV.

The comparison displayed above is indeed not precise. We should plug
directly our prediction in the experimental analysis as some
uncertainties have been already taken into account by the experiments in
the calculation of the SM line of Fig. 45 . Nevertheless we advocate to
separate experimental and theoretical results on such a graph in order
to make the comparison more relevant. We will in the next consider
different scenarios and give the results published in Ref. [ 95 ] where
the procedure described below has been used. The reader should note that
this work is based on the former results of the Tevatron experiments
when the luminosity was of order 5.9 fb @xmath . The new result of the
CDF experiment use a luminosity of 7.1 fb @xmath ; nevertheless our
conclusions will remain, especially that the new Tevatron results have
induced a slightly reduction of the exclusion range from 158–175 GeV
down to 158–173 GeV.

Before describing the more precise way of handling the comparison
between our results and those of the CDF/D0 collaborations, we stress
again that the comparison between our values and those assumed by the
experimental collaborations becomes even worse when the cross section is
evaluated with another set of PDFs. For instance, with the ABKM PDF
parametrization, there is a reduction of @xmath of the normalisation
compared to the central value adopted in the CDF/D0 combined analysis.
We should also take into account the uncertainties on the backgrounds in
order to make complete predictions. The by far largest background is
@xmath for which CDF/D0 assume the inclusive cross section to be @xmath
pb. We have reevaluated the rate using MCFM [ 274 ] and find @xmath pb
using the MSTW scheme (the errors due to @xmath are negligible here)
which gives @xmath pb if the errors are added according to our procedure
developed for the signal cross section. If we adopt the ABKM or HERAPDF
sets, we would obtain a rate of, respectively, 12.35 pb and 11.81 pb.
i.e. nearly @xmath higher in the maximal case. We will thus consider
that @xmath can be @xmath larger/lower than assumed by CDF/D0.

Thus if the @xmath total uncertainty assumed by the CDF collaboration is
adopted, one can consider three scenarios:

1.  The first scenario is a reduction of @xmath by @xmath to account for
    the difference between the quadratic and (almost) linear ways of
    combining the individual uncertainties.

2.  The second scenario is simply to adopt the normalisation obtained
    using the ABKM PDFs which gives an @xmath reduction of @xmath in the
    critical region. In both scenarios 1 and 2, the remaining @xmath
    uncertainty due to scale variation and the EFT will correspond to
    the overall theoretical uncertainty that has been assumed in the
    Tevatron analysis.

3.  The additionnal third scenario will be to consider the same
    assumptions in the first scenario for the signal and change the
    normalization of the @xmath background by @xmath .

In Ref. [ 95 ] , the exploration of the Tevatron exclusion limit is
based on the CDF study published in Ref. [ 275 ] which provides with all
the necessary details. In the analysis of the @xmath signal, the
production cross section has been broken into the three pieces which
yield different final state signal topologies, namely @xmath +0 jet,
@xmath +1 jet and @xmath +2 jets or more. These channels which
represent, respectively, @xmath , @xmath and @xmath of the total @xmath
[ 112 ] , have been studied separately. In the @xmath +0 jet and +1 jet
samples, two configurations have been analyzed, one with a high and one
with a low signal over background ratio (depending on the quality of the
lepton identification). In addition, a sample with a low invariant mass
for the two leptons, @xmath GeV, has been included. Five additional
channels resulting from the contributions of the Higgs–strahlung
processes are also included: @xmath leading to same sign dilepton and to
trilepton final states. These channels give rather small signal rates,
though.

One then estimates the necessary relative variation of the integrated
luminosity needed to reproduce the currently quoted sensitivity of the
CDF collaboration, if the normalization of the Higgs signal cross
section (as well as the corresponding backgrounds) is different from the
one assumed to obtain the results. In Ref. [ 95 ] it has first been
tried to reproduce as closely as possible the CDF results for a Higgs
mass @xmath GeV for which the sensitivity is almost the best. They have
used the information given in Ref. [ 275 ] , that is the background,
signal and data numbers for all the search channels of Tables I–VIII,
and also their neural network outputs for the 10 search channels (each
one for the signals, backgrounds and data) presented in Figs. 2,4,
@xmath ,16 to build the background only and the background plus signal
hypotheses, implemented them in the program MClimit [ 276 ] and used a
ratio of log–likelihood “à la LEP” as a test–statistic for which we
combined the above channels; this provided the 95 %CL/ @xmath
sensitivity limit on the Higgs boson at the considered mass of @xmath
GeV. A median expected 95 %CL/ @xmath limit of @xmath has been obtained,
to be compared to @xmath in the CDF analysis; for the observed 95 %CL/
@xmath limit, the agreement is better as we obtain 1.35 compared to
1.32. As the CDF and D0 collaboration agree in their methods only within
10% accuracy for the same imput Monte Carlo and data [ 277 ] , it is
believed that the procedure is satisfactory enough to be used in the
three scenarios described above.

The first two scenarios discussed previously which, in practice, when
compared to the CDF/D0 results, reduce the normalisation of the @xmath
signal cross section by approximatively @xmath when all the
uncertainties are added using our procedure, approximatively @xmath when
the ABKM set is used to derive the central value of the cross section,
will be considered. The third scenario adds the effect of the background
uncertainties. The authors of Ref. [ 95 ] then estimate the relative
variation of the sensitivity and increase the integrated luminosity
until we recover our initial sensitivity. Finally, it is assumed that
the obtained relative variations of the sensitivity, as well as the
required luminosity to reproduce the initial sensitivity, would be the
same for the CDF experiment.

For each scenario, the expected signals and the corresponding
backgrounds at the Tevatron have been multiplied by a luminosity factor
that has been varied. For each value of the luminosity factor, the
corresponding median expected 95%CL/ @xmath has been estimated and
normalized to the initial sensitivity @xmath obtained above. We display
in Fig. 46 the final result, where the Tevatron luminosity is shown as a
function of the obtained normalized sensitivity. The luminosity needed
to recover the current @xmath CDF sensitivity is given by the
intersection of the vertical blue line with the luminosity curves. The
third scenario where the normalization of the background cross sections
is changed by approximatively @xmath ⁵⁷ ⁵⁷ 57 The correlation between
signal and background is implicitly taken into account as we use the
results of Ref. [ 275 ] ; we assume though that it is almost the same
when another PDF set is adopted for both signal and background. has also
been considered. The final result is that if @xmath is lowered by @xmath
, a luminosity of @xmath fb @xmath , compared to 5.9 fb @xmath used in [
275 ] would be required for the same analysis to obtain the current
sensitivity. If the rate is lower by 30%, the required luminosity should
increase to @xmath fb @xmath , i.e. nearly a factor of two, to obtain
the CDF sensitivity with 5.9 fb @xmath ; as the newest CDF analysis with
7.1 fb @xmath leads to a slightly worse exclusion limit @xmath GeV, we
believe that recovering this last exclusion limit should require @xmath
fb @xmath , that is still a factor of two than the current used
luminosity . In the third scenario, we see that increasing/decreasing
the background will degrade/improve the sensitivity and an @xmath
higher/lower luminosity would be required to recover the sensitivity.

#### 6.6 Summary of the results

After the results of sections 4 and 5 on the production cross sections
we have given in this section our theoretical prediction of the Higgs
decay branching fractions, together with a detailed analysis of the
parametric uncertainties that affect the predictions.

We have found that in the two main decay search channels @xmath and
@xmath the uncertainties are sizeable and have some impact in the
intermediate mass range @xmath GeV. We then have combined the production
cross section and decay branching ratio in section 6.3 for the Tevatron
and section 6.4 for the LHC and found that in particular for the @xmath
channel at the Tevatron the uncertainties are more important than for
the production cross section alone.

We then have compared our results with those of the CDF and D0
experiments. We have presented a naive approach that has cast some
doubts on the 95%CL exclusion limit. This is then confirmed by a more
rigorous approach that we have presented in the end of section 6.5 ,
where we conclude that the reduction of the signal by 30% as would be
the case if the ABKM set were used for its normalization, would reopen
the entire mass range @xmath –173 GeV excluded by the CDF/D0 analysis
with 12.6 fb @xmath combined data: this means that even if our
uncertainties are viewed as being too conservative (which we believe is
certainly not the case, as demonstrated above) the exclusion limit
critically depends on the considered PDF. That is a non–satisfactory
situation which needs to be cured and in particular the PDF case is
still open, see for example Refs. [ 278 , 279 , 280 ] on the comparison
between DIS–only and global fits that is still strongly disputed between
the experts. We also note that the exclusion limit is also disputed in
Ref. [ 281 ] with arguments different from that presented in this
thesis. Henceforth the Tevatron results on the SM Higgs boson mass is
strongly debated within the community.

This results put an end to the first two parts of this thesis that have
been devoted to the study of the Higgs boson within the Standard Model.
However this is not the end of the story, as there are strong
indications that new physics beyond the SM is needed to describe the
sub--atomic world, just to mention the experimental proof of the
neutrinos masses which are not included in the SM ⁵⁸ ⁵⁸ 58 This can be
accommodated in some ways without introducing new physics, e.g. with a
right–handed neutrino yet–to–be–seen put by hand in the theory; this is
not a satisfactory way as we do not have any (good) explanation why this
right–handed neutrino has not yet been observed. . We will then turn our
attention to one of the most popular beyond–the–SM scenario:
supersymmetric theories. Part III will introduce the theoretical
concepts of supersymmetry (SUSY) and its application to the minimal
extension of the SM, called the MSSM. Part IV will give our results on
the SUSY Higgs boson(s) production and decay at the Tevatron and LHC
colliders.

## Part III The Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model

### 7 Why Supersymmetry is appealing

The first two parts of this thesis were devoted to the extensive study
of the Higgs boson phenomenology at hadron colliders within the SM
theory. However we have already stated that this theory is bound to be
considered as an effective model of a more elaborated theory
yet–to–be–discovered: indeed, there are many models on the market that
go beyond the SM, none of them being well established by experiments.

We will study in the following sections one of the most appealing
scenarios beyond the SM: the minimal extension of the SM in the context
of supersymmetry (SUSY). This theory will be presented in the following
sections but to begin with we remind the reader that SUSY is a symmetry
between bosons and fermions: it relates these two degrees of freedom
through new fermionic operators, and any supersymmetric lagrangian has
to be invariant by the exchange of the bosonic and fermionic degrees of
freedom grouped in one same multiplet. We will first give some reasons
why SUSY is a very appealing theory and then in the two next sections
introduce its formal aspects and application to the minimal extension of
the SM.

#### 7.1 The hierarchy problem

When the Standard Model was described in section 1.1 , one of the key
arguments in going from the old @xmath theory for the weak interaction
to the current electroweak theory was that it enables calculations
beyond the Fermi scale and in particular the weak electron–neutrino
scattering be well behaved at high center–of–mass energies, that is the
unitarity requirement. However, we have seen that the SM itself is not
free from potential unitarity problem and we have assessed bounds on the
SM Higgs boson following from the unitarity requirement. This exercice,
along other ways of obtaining theoretical bounds on the SM Higgs boson,
has shown that the scalar sector of the SM is in some sense ill–defined:
it concentrates most of the difficulties of the SM, as it is an unstable
sector not protected by any symmetry, and this will be presented in this
subsection.

The major problem of the Higgs boson mass is that quantum corrections of
this fundamental parameter of the theory is of quadratically divergent
type. If we take the one–loop corrections, they are described by the
Feynman diagrams depicted in Fig. 47 below.

If we take for example the first fermionic diagram, the typical
contribution is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

were @xmath is 3 for a quark, 1 for a lepton. If we rewrite the
integrand it reads

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

which contains a quadratic divergence as the first term, after the
integration with a cut–off @xmath at high @xmath momentum, gives a term
proportionnal to @xmath . The actual dominant contribution, taking into
account self–Higgs interactions and weak bosons contributions along that
of the fermionic, reads [ 45 , 211 ] :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

This is a very severe divergence which is retained even after
renormalization. Indeed, if the SM were to be valid up to the Planck
scale @xmath GeV the Higgs boson mass would be attracted to that scale
and would have a mass of order @xmath : we would need a counterterm that
is hugely fined–tuned in order to keep the Higgs boson mass below the
theoretical bounds of order 1 TeV as presented in section 3.1 . If we
forget about the bosonic contributions to the Higgs boson mass, we see
that the correction in Eq. 7.2 does not depend on @xmath : this means
that even if we were to set @xmath we still would have the same problem.
No symmetry then protects the SM Higgs boson to be driven to high
masses, hence making this parameter unnatural. This is exactly the
naturalness problem of the SM, see Ref. [ 282 , 283 ] . The related
question, which is the gauge hierarchy problem, is why the new physics
scale that drives the SM Higgs boson mass, is much heavier than say
@xmath which is typical of the electroweak scale, see also Ref. [ 284 ]
.

How to solve this technical (but theoretically unsatisfactory) problem?
One solution would be to introduce new degrees of freedom which would
arrange themselves to cancel out exactly the contributions of the
standard bosons and fermions. We start from Eq. 7.1 where the leading
quadratic divergence reads @xmath (we discard in this analysis the
additionnal @xmath factor that is irrelevant for the point discussed).
We follow Refs. [ 284 , 285 ] ; we introduce @xmath new complex scalar
fields @xmath with

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

This induces two types of corrections to the Higgs boson mass following
the two bosonic diagrams in Fig. 47 , and again when writing only the
quadratic divergence it reads:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

If we combine Eqs. 7.1 and 7.4 we see that the cancellation of quadratic
divergences, in other words having @xmath , can be obtained provided
that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

This results is of utmost importance: it means that if we introduce a
symmetry between bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom that arranges
to follow Eq. 7.5 we can solve the naturalness of the SM. Following Ref.
[ 211 , 284 ] we can even go further and cancel the logarithmic
divergence without renormalization analysis if we impose @xmath . We are
even temptated to assign for each fermion @xmath , which has a left and
right chirality, two new complex scalar partners @xmath and @xmath where
the index refers to the original fermionic degree of freedom and not any
chirality for the scalar fields. Note that the total number of degree of
freedom is conserved by this assignment.

This is exactly the virtue of SUSY which is a symmetry between bosons
and fermions: each SM boson and each SM fermion has its own
(super)partner, respectively a fermion and a boson. The relationship
between the standard particles and these new degrees of freedom ensures
that we get rid of quadratic divergencies, thus solving the weak
hierarchy problem. This is one particularly elegant reason why SUSY is a
very appealing theory beyond the SM.

#### 7.2 Coupling constants convergence at high energies

We now turn our attention to a less severe problem as it deals with
speculative questions. For centuries atomic and then sub--atomic physics
have tried to unify the description of fundamental processes, starting
from the unification of electricity and magnetism into a single
electromagnetic interaction, currently described by QED. It is then
strongly believed that the current electroweak ⁵⁹ ⁵⁹ 59 We want to point
out in passing that the weak and electromagnetic interactions are
partially unified in the electroweak framework: the gauge algebra @xmath
has two couplings constants, whereas we should only have a single Lie
group @xmath with a single coupling constant @xmath to really have
unification. This is the goal of any Grand Unified Theory, with the
additionnal strong interaction unification to the electroweak
interaction. and strong interactions unify at a very high energy scale,
@xmath GeV. Several attempts have been made for fourty years and the
most well–known solution is the long–celebrated @xmath theory [ 286 ]
(see also Ref. [ 287 ] ). This model is nowadays excluded because of the
too short proton life–time and the disagreement between the measured
Weinberg angle @xmath and the predicted value of the @xmath model;
nevertheless it provides a very useful example of a grand unified
theory.

Gauge couplings are renormalized and thus running couplings. The running
proceeds through quantum loop corrections, see Fig. 48 for typical
diagramms at the 1–loop order, and is described through renormalization
group equations [ 288 , 289 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.6)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

with the SM coefficients taken at the 1–loop order. The hypercharge
coupling constant @xmath has been rescaled by a factor of 5/3 in order
to match unified gauge description in the covariant derivation.

Fig. 49 shows on the left the resulting running within the SM, assuming
no new particles content between the weak scale and the GUT scale. The
three gauge couplings seem to meet at high energy but not exactly:
unification is not exactly achieved if we do not assume new particles
content between the weak scale and the GUT scale, assuming that the new
degree of freedom required by grand unification have a mass of order
@xmath ⁶⁰ ⁶⁰ 60 There is no reason why this should not be the case: if
that were the case we would have to introduce a mechanism explaining why
these new particles had a reduced mass. and thus not contributing to the
RGE [ 286 ] .

The right part of Fig. 49 reproduces the same exercice but replacing the
RGE parameters by those obtained assuming new particles content due to
the additionnal particles within the minimal supersymmetric extension of
the SM, called the MSSM. Indeed the running of the three gauge couplings
is expected to change as higher–order corrections involve new fermions
and bosons (the so–called superpartners of the standard particles). We
thus have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

which now allow the three gauge couplings to perfectly match at @xmath
GeV [ 289 ] . This is a spectacular reason why the addition of SUSY to
the SM is very elegant: it helps to push toward an actual unification of
the three sub–atomic interactions.

#### 7.3 SUSY and Dark Matter searches

The two subsections above have presented two technical reasons that
explain why SUSY is an interesting solution to both internal problems of
the SM and external difficulties in the wish to obtain a Grand Unified
Theory (GUT) where all the interactions are unified in a single Lie
algebra, with all the coupling constants merged into a single one at
very high energy. We will in this subsection present an experimental
reason of introducing SUSY, connected to cosmology puzzles.

Indeed, all the cosmological observations ⁶¹ ⁶¹ 61 We here take the
(standard) point of view that general relativity still holds at such
large scales. However this is nothing more than a mere assumption,
general relativity not being tested as such large scales. There are
alternative cosmological attempts to explain the cosmological
observations such as the galaxies profiles without the standard @xmath
–CDM model based on general relativity on the cosmological scales, which
does not require a dark matter component, see Ref. [ 290 , 291 ] for
example. However we will not come into such unecessary discussions for
the rest of the thesis. point out to the existence of an unknown matter
component of the Universe which amounts to nearly 23% of the total
energy density of our current Universe [ 292 , 293 , 294 ] . If we take
the exact numbers from Ref. [ 294 ] we have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

This matter density is more than four times the density of standard
matter that we know, which means that there is a very large amount of
the Universe that is yet to be understood, not to mention the nearly 73%
of dark energy density that is even more mysterious and drives the
current acceleration of the expansion of the Universe. Particle physics
is then confronted to a critical problem: how to account for this
missing 23% piece of the Universe, which is absent from the SM? Any
theory that goes beyond the SM ought to provide for realistic dark
matter candidates.

If we come back to SUSY, we remind that we have introduced new fermions
and bosons in the theory, as a consequence of the symmetry between
bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. We then have new vertexes and
in particular we should care about the proton decay. Indeed, the proton
lifetime is estimated to be larger than 10 @xmath years, thus any theory
beyond the SM (where the proton is stable) must respect this lower
bound, which means in practice to assure that the proton remains stable.
Strictly speaking, this is not possible with the most general SUSY
extension of the SM: for example we could have the decay @xmath as
depicted in Fig. 50 below.

This can be cast away if we impose, as is the case in the minimal
supersymmetric extension of the SM, a new global discrete symmetry
called @xmath –parity [ 295 ] : we assign a multiplicative number @xmath
, where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath stand respectively for the baryon
number, the lepton number and the spin. It reduces in the end to @xmath
for standard matter, and @xmath for superpartners. @xmath –parity is
connected to the @xmath conservation, indeed we have @xmath . Any
reaction is now supposed to conserve this @xmath number. This discrete
symmetry can be seen as a relic of a global @xmath symmetry broken down
to a @xmath subgroup, see Ref. [ 284 ] page 359.

We can now evade the problem of the proton decay: as the quarks (u,d)
are standard particles their @xmath –number is equal to one, thus it
forbids any vertex with only one superpartner involved such as the
violating vertexes in Fig. 50 .

How is this statement connected to our cosmological problem? If we
introduce @xmath –parity to block the proton decay, it has also a very
interesting consequence: superparticles ought to be produced in pairs,
and if the proton is to be stable on the one hand, we can easily make
the same statement for the lightest supersymmetric particle. Hence we
predict that any supersymmetric spectrum following @xmath –parity
conservation must have a stable particle!

The lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) in the context of the minimal
supersymmetric extension of the SM is a neutral mixture of the
superpartners of the weak bosons and Higgs bosons ⁶² ⁶² 62 The plural
form is not accidental: we will see later on that there must be at least
two Higgs doublets in the MSSM. called the neutralino @xmath . This is a
stable, neutral, massive particle, hence an ideal candidate for the dark
matter component of the Universe (see Ref. [ 296 ] for a review on this
topic). This is worth mentioning that this LSP is nothing more than just
one candidate among many others. Nevertheless the LSP explication for
dark matter is one of the most popular scenerios that could explain the
origin of dark matter.

### 8 Formal SUSY aspects

Now that we have introduced some reasons to explain our interest in
supersymmetric theories, we are ready to sketch some formal aspects of
supersymmetry. Basically, as stated in the section 7 above,
supersymmetry (SUSY) is a symmetry between bosons and fermions: each
scalar boson has a spin @xmath partner, each spin @xmath fermion has a
spin 0 partner, each vector boson has a spin @xmath partner ⁶³ ⁶³ 63
Here we leave aside the case of the graviton and its gravitino
superpartner of spin @xmath . . A theory is said to be supersymmetric
when the exchange of any pair of partners leaves the action invariant.
We will see that it is a very elegant extension of the usual Poincaré
algebra and in some sense “natural”.

The first subsection will introduce the super–algebra, following the
outlines of a very famous theoretical physics theorem that shapes any
extension of the Poincaré algebra. We will then give some hints of the
superspace formalism that allow for a compact description of the
supermultiplets. We will end by the introduction to SUSY breaking, one
of the most important issue in the study of SUSY theories that is still
to be solved.

#### 8.1 Graded Lie Algebra and the Coleman–Mandula theorem

The mathemetical formalism of SUSY theories is based on the concept of
graded Lie algebras which generalizes the usual Lie algebras to
encompass anticommutators as well as Lie brackets. The actual shape of
SUSY algebra is dictated by very powerful formal theorems: the
Coleman–Mandula theorem [ 297 ] and the Haag–Lopuszanzski –Sohnius (HLS)
theorem [ 298 ] which generalizes the Coleman–Mandula theorem and leads
to SUSY graded Lie algebra. We will not prove these theorems in this
section, but discuss their consequences.

##### 8.1.1 The Coleman–Mandula and HLS theorems

We will follow Refs. [ 299 , 284 ] in this paragraph. The statement of
the Coleman–Mandula theorem is:

  With the following assumptions:

  1.   The @xmath –matrix is based on a local, relativistic quantum
      field theory in four–dimensional spacetime;

  2.   For a given mass, there is only a finite number of different
      particles associated to one–particle states;

  3.   There is an energy gap between the vacuum and the one–particle
      states;

  the most general Lie algebra of symmetries of the @xmath –matrix
  contains the Poincaré algebra and a finite number of Lorentz scalar
  operators @xmath which must belong to a compact Lie algebra.

This theorem then puts some restrictions on the form of the symmetries
than can be imposed on the @xmath –matrix: any Lie algebra not of the
type of the Poincaré algebra shall be in direct sum with the Poincaré
algebra, that is, if we define the generator as @xmath and the structure
constants @xmath we have:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the Lorentz generator, @xmath the translation generator.
We see that this imposes severe restrictions to any bosonic symmetry
(represented by a gauge Lie algebra), but what if we introduce a
fermionic symmetry? This is precisely the spirit of SUSY, in which
graded Lie algebras escape the Coleman–Mandula theorem by using
anticommutators in addition to the usual Lie commutators. The HLS
theorem then states that the only graded Lie algebra which is compatible
with the Coleman–Mandula theorem assumptions is precisely that of the
supersymmetry algebra which will be described below.

The HLS theorem precisely states the following (see also Ref. [ 284 ] ,
page 31):

  The Lie algebra which follows the assumptions of the Coleman–Mandula
  theorem is a @xmath graded Lie algebra which odd generators belong to
  the representations @xmath and @xmath of the Lorentz algebra and even
  generators are a direct sum of the Poincaré generators and other
  symmetry generators.

This puts a restriction over the form of the new fermionic symmetry that
we want to introduce through the anticommutators: this must be
represented by a set of two @xmath generators which are of spin @xmath ,
but not higher. The minimal choice is to take a set of two Majorana
spinors @xmath (ie where the spinor is invariant under charge
conjugaison) and we will use Weyl two–components notation; in
four–components notation with Dirac spinors we would have one Majorana
spinor

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We will give the final super–Poincaré algebra relations. If we follow
the HLS theorem, we see that the anticommutator @xmath has no choice but
to be proportionnal to @xmath (if not it would violate the
Coleman–Mandula theorem). This precisely dictates the final shape of the
super–Poincaré algebra:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.2)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

where we recall that @xmath , @xmath being the usual set of Pauli
matrices, @xmath , @xmath . In four–components notation with only one
four–components Majorana generator @xmath the super–Poincaré algebra 8.2
reads (see Ref. [ 284 ] page 34)

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.3)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

where this time we have @xmath and the charge conjugate operator @xmath
in Dirac representation.

Using the SUSY algebra we can derive two important consequences:

-    In each supermultiplet spanning a representation of the SUSY
    algebra there is an equal number of bosons and fermions: if we
    introduce the operator @xmath which takes +1 eigenvalue on bosonic
    states and -1 eingenvalue on fermionic states, and take a closed
    supermultiplet @xmath with a definite (non–zero) @xmath momentum, we
    have

      -- -------- -------- -------- --
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                  @xmath   @xmath   
                  @xmath   @xmath   
      -- -------- -------- -------- --

    using the cyclicity of the trace operator and the fact that @xmath ,
    as can be easily verified. If we replace the anticommutator by the
    first equality of Eq. 8.3 it reads

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    discarding the constant @xmath factor. Having chosen @xmath this
    reduces to

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (8.4)
      -- -------- -- -------

    where @xmath ( @xmath ) stands for the total number of fermionic
    states (bosonic states) within the supermultiplet. This is thus
    exactly the result we were looking for.

-    Each superpartner must have the same mass within a SUSY multiplet:
    indeed if SUSY is exact, @xmath implies that @xmath .

We want to note that the super–Poincaré algebra has two important
features: the first is that it is an extension of the usual space–time
symmetry and thus can be considered also as a space–time symmetry,
making SUSY a fundamental symmetry; the second feature is that as the
anticommutator of two supersymmetry generators @xmath gives the
translation generator @xmath , it means that if we gauge SUSY we also
gauge the usual space–time symmetry. Thus there is an intimate connexion
between SUSY and gravity which is described in the context of
supergravity theories [ 299 ] . It is sometimes said that gravity is
“the square–root of SUSY”.

##### 8.1.2 The Wess–Zumino free field model as an example of a SUSY
lagrangian

We close this subsection by giving the most simple example of a SUSY
lagrangian, the free field model called the massless non–interacting
Wess–Zumino model [ 300 ] , following the outlines of Ref. [ 285 ] . To
parametrize a SUSY transformation we introduce an infinitesimal @xmath
Grassmann parameter, which implies using the super–Poincaré algebra of
Eq. 8.2 that @xmath .

In the Wess–Zumino model we have one complex scalar field and one
left–handed Weyl spinor field. The former is the superpartner of the
latter; if we count the number of degrees of freedom we see that we have
on–shell 2 bosonic and 2 fermionic degrees of freedom; nevertheless we
would like to describe the most general lagrangian in the view of the
quantum corrections. This means that we have to introduce an auxiliary
scalar field @xmath in order to match the 4 fermionic degree of freedoms
off-shell. This constitute the chiral supermultiplet. The lagrangian is
written as:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

In Eq. 8.5 we see explicitely that @xmath is an auxiliary field, as its
equation of motion is @xmath . Its has a mass dimension of 2 which is
unusual for a scalar field. A SUSY transformation is written as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.6)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

which reads [ 285 , 299 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.7)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

In Eq. 8.7 the role of @xmath is to close the SUSY algebra, that is
@xmath , even in the off–shell case. The lagrangian 8.5 is then
invariant up to a total space–time derivative:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.8)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

The action is then fully SUSY invariant. We will see in the next section
how to introduce in a simple way interactions which follow SUSY
invariance, through the concept of superpotential.

#### 8.2 Superspace, superfields and superpotential

We introduce in this subsection the superspace and superfield formalism
which is a very compact and elegant formulation of SUSY, enlightening
its deep connection with space-time symmetries. We will follow Refs. [
299 , 284 ] .

The first step is to introduce the superspace: this is simply the usual
space–time with the coordinates @xmath enlarged to include two
additionnal two–components Grassmann (anticommuting) coordinates @xmath
. We then have @xmath and @xmath , but @xmath , @xmath . This means that
any product of @xmath which contains more than three @xmath terms
vanishes.

We introduce fields on this superspace, which we call superfields. By
the virtue of the Grassmann coordinates, any superfield @xmath can be
expanded in a finite serie of @xmath variables:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.9)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

As the operators @xmath and @xmath follow an ordinary Lie algebra, it is
temptating to use the following SUSY transformation representation
@xmath [ 299 ] . A linear SUSY transformation then reads in the
superspace as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

which then induces the following linear representation of the
supersymmetric generators

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.11)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

We are now ready to present the chiral and vector superfields that are
used to construct the SUSY extension of the SM.

##### 8.2.1 The chiral superfield

The chiral superfield will associate the standard fermionic fields with
their spin 0 superpartners. In order to have a SUSY invariant
definition, we shall construct a SUSY covariant derivative. As @xmath
commute with @xmath but not @xmath nor @xmath . Following Ref. [ 284 ]
we define

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.12)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

with which we define the (left) chiral superfield to follow these two
equivalent conditions:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

This gives this component decomposition

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.14)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

The SM fermion field will be @xmath , its scalar superpartner will be
@xmath and called a sfermion. The field @xmath will be the auxiliary
field necessary to ensure SUSY invariance in the off–shell case. Any
product of chiral superfields will still be a superfield [ 284 , 299 ] ;
the @xmath –component of a chiral superfield, that is the @xmath
component, transforming as a total spatial derivative under a SUSY
transformation, the @xmath –component of any product of chiral
superfields is a candidate for any lagrangian describing a SUSY
invariant action.

The product @xmath is not a chiral superfield; nevertheless its highest
@xmath component is SUSY invariant up to a total derivative like any
@xmath component, and reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

This will constitute the kinetic part of the chiral superfield. We then
can rewrite the Wess–Zumino massless free lagrangian of Eq. 8.5 simply
as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

##### 8.2.2 The vector superfield

The second type of superfield will yield the gauge vector bosons. We
impose a reality condition which define a vector superfield

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

We can then use the general superfield written in Eq. 8.9 to obtain the
expression of a vector superfield, but we will simplify the task in the
next lines.

Following strictly Ref. [ 284 ] it is interesting to note that if we use
a chiral superfield @xmath the superfield @xmath is a vector superfield.
This implies the following abelian super–gauge transformation @xmath .
This is indeed a gauge transformation as @xmath is a function of the
super–space coordinates. We are free to chose a particular gauge, the
Wess-Zumino gauge in which a vector superfield reduces to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

The SM gauge boson field will be @xmath , its fermionic superpartner
will be @xmath and called the gaugino. The @xmath field is that of the
auxiliary necessary to ensure SUSY invariance even in the off–shell
case, as did the @xmath field in the case of a chiral superfield. As
stated in Ref. [ 284 ] the @xmath –term has the very interesting virtue
to remains invariant under a supergauge transformation, making this term
a very good candidate for writing supergauge and SUSY invariant
lagrangian. It is actually very easy to introduce a @xmath supergauge
theory by taking a chiral superfield @xmath and a vector superfield
@xmath , with

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.19)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the @xmath charge of the superfield @xmath . A vector
field is of zero mass dimension and thus can be exponentiated, which
means that we can define

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

to be the lagrangian part containing both the kinetic term for the
chiral superfield (the first factor in the exponential expansion) and
the gauge invariant interacting term (i.e. the usual covariant
derivative). The extension to an non–abelian supergauge theory follows
the same pattern, that is introducing a gauge multiplet of chiral
superfields @xmath and then write down (in the Wess–Zumino gauge):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.21)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

with @xmath as the usual generators of the non–abelian gauge algebra.
Note that the @xmath notation is here a non–abelian gauge index and not
a spinorial index.

We now end this paragraph by giving the superfield–strength @xmath which
is a chiral superfield (see Ref. [ 284 ] page 65):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath as a spinorial index. This superfield contains the usual
field–strength tensor @xmath . We then define

  -- -- -- --------
           (8.23)
  -- -- -- --------

which is coherent as we have a sum of product of chiral superfields
which itself is also a chiral superfield, thus its @xmath –term is SUSY
invariant.

##### 8.2.3 The superpotential

The last remaining piece that is needed to write down the most complete
SUSY (renormalizable) lagrangian is the interaction among the scalar
fields and between the scalars and fermions fields. The most simple way
to introduce these interactions is to use a superpotential, in much the
same spirit as above for the definition of the covariant derivative.

As the product of chiral superfields is also a superfield, the
definition of a renormalizable superpotential is a superfield @xmath
restricted by the following conditions:

1.  It is an holomorphic expression of @xmath chiral superfield, thus
    not containing any @xmath superfield;

2.  It does not contain any product higher that @xmath to ensure
    renormalizability;

The same conditions hold for the @xmath superfield where we replace
@xmath by @xmath everywhere. The induced term in the lagrangian will be
simply the @xmath –term of the superpotential. The final lagrangian for
a @xmath gauge interaction among chiral superfields @xmath mediated by a
vector superfield @xmath then writes

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.24)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

in which @xmath is a complex number, @xmath and @xmath are complex
tensors symmetric in their indices, and we have also included a @xmath
–term @xmath with @xmath being real, as the @xmath –term of any vector
superfield is both SUSY and supergauge invariant. The generalization to
non–abelian gauge interactions is straightforward.

The use of the Lagrangian equations for the auxiliary fields which can
then be eliminated gives

  -- -- -- --------
           (8.25)
  -- -- -- --------

In the lagrangian 8.24 the scalar potential then reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the @xmath –term comes from the vector superfield and is dictated
by SUSY and gauge invariance. The Yukawa interactions among scalar
fields and fermion fields reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

The superpotential then controls the shape of the scalar potential which
is of utmost importance when dealing with spontaneous gauge symmetry
breaking. We have finished the description of SUSY lagrangian in the
very compact and elegant superspace description which generalizes the
usual space–time field formalism. If we look at the lagrangian 8.24 the
writing of interacting term is as in the usual field formalism, but with
ordinary fields replaced by superfields and taking the @xmath or @xmath
terms in the end. This is why the superspace description is so powerful.

#### 8.3 Soft SUSY breaking

Up until now we have dealt with exact SUSY lagrangians, that are known
to be renormalizable, see Ref. [ 301 ] . However experiments tells us
that SUSY is broken: indeed as seen in section 8.1 we should observe the
exact superpartner of the electron, that is a scalar selectron with the
same mass @xmath keV. That is obviously not the case, hence SUSY has to
be broken.

##### 8.3.1 General soft SUSY beaking

If we recall the virtues of SUSY introduced in section 7 we do want to
break SUSY but still keeping these virtues , and in particular the
resolution of the weak hierarchy problem explained in section 7.1 . We
recall that if we take a Dirac fermion @xmath and its scalar
superpartners @xmath , @xmath , exact SUSY which cancels completely the
1–loop corrections to the Higgs mass leads to @xmath , no trilinear
@xmath coupling and the Yukawa equality @xmath . We still want to cancel
quadratic divergences and thus keep the equality @xmath , but break the
equality @xmath and allow for @xmath , which means that logarithmic
divergences will arise to be renormalized by the standard procedures. An
explicit SUSY breaking that ensures these conditions is called soft SUSY
breaking: only terms of mass dimension not higher that three are
authorized in the soft SUSY breaking part of the lagrangian [ 301 , 302
, 303 ] . We thus have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.28)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

@xmath is the mass term for the gauginos @xmath , @xmath being a gauge
index for a given algebra @xmath ; @xmath is an hermitian matrix
describing the mass terms for the sfermions, @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
being the tadpole, bilinear and trilinear scalar couplings. @xmath
obviously breaks SUSY as there are no fermions nor gauge bosons within
it. We note for consistency that @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are SUSY
invariant factors that come from the superpotential, see Eq. 8.24 with
@xmath replaced by @xmath (thus reserving @xmath for the SUSY breaking
sfermions masses terms).

The tadpole arises only with gauge singlet; as it does not appear in the
minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM, we will discard this term in
the rest of the thesis.

##### 8.3.2 What is the origin of soft SUSY breaking?

It is obvious that this way of SUSY breaking is not satisfactory: we
would like to have the same receipt as for the electroweak symmetry
breaking, namely a spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry that is more
elegant than just explicit breaking and could explain the origin of the
various SUSY breaking terms. This is one of the most tedious questions
in SUSY theoretical studies nowadays and we get several mechanisms on
the market, none of them being convincing in every situation. We will
not come into details but rather present how can spontaneous SUSY
breaking arise and what will be the impact on phenomenological studies.

In exact SUSY theories the hamiltonian is always positive, as we get,
see Refs [ 284 , 299 , 285 ] ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

If the vacuum is SUSY invariant, we should have @xmath for any pair of
@xmath parameters, that is @xmath . It then turns that if SUSY is exact
the vacuum state @xmath must have a vanishing energy . The minimum of
the scalar potential must be zero in exact SUSY theories.

Taking the other point of view, it means that as long as the scalar
potential is non zero at its global minimum, we have spontaneously
broken SUSY: this can be done through auxiliary @xmath or @xmath terms
which are the only non physical fields that can play this role, as the
scalar potential contains these two fields. A SUSY breaking through
@xmath –terms is called the O’Raifeartaigh mechanism [ 304 ] , if we use
@xmath –terms it is called the Fayet–Iliopoulos mechanism [ 305 ] . Only
@xmath –terms ensure a spontaneously SUSY breaking with non–abelian
gauge theories, see Ref. [ 284 ] page 140.

In any phenomenological theory which incorporates spontaneous symmetry
breaking, such as the constrained minimal extension of the SM, the
spontaneous breakdown of SUSY is assumed to arise in a “hidden sector”
of the theory at the GUT scale. This hidden sector has only very small
couplings (if any) to the phenomenological sector (or visible sector)
and we need messengers, that is superfields that share some interactions
between the hidden sector and the visible sector. There are several ways
of achieving such a goal (see Refs. [ 284 , 285 ] for more details), one
of the most popular using gravity interactions in the minimal
supergravity theory (mSUGRA). In that case SUSY is broken in the hidden
sector by some vev @xmath and we get the soft term in the visible sector
through gravitationnal interactions, that is:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this model we have the graviton and its superpartner the gravitino.
The goldstino fermion, relic of the spontaneous breakdown of SUSY (in
much the same way as the Goldstone boson in spontaneously broken bosonic
gauge symmetry), becomes part of the gravitino field which then has got
a mass. We then use renormalization group equations (RGE) to evolve the
couplings from the GUT scale down to the SUSY scale where the
phenomenological SUSY terms, in particular the soft SUSY beaking terms,
are defined. We will present in the next section the minimal set of
parameters at the GUT scale for a mSUGRA model in the MSSM.

### 9 The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model

In this part III we have already given some reasons why it is
interesting to study supersymmetry by itself and we have given the SUSY
formalism to construct supersymmetric theories. The content of this
section is to apply these theoretical fundations to the building of a
minimal extension of the SM, called the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model or MSSM in short. This will be minimal in the sense that we
incorporate as minimal number of fields as possible. We will see that it
leads to a richer Higgs phenomenology that will be discussed in the next
part IV .

The first subsection will introduce the MSSM, the second subsection will
explain in more details the Higgs sector; the last subsection will be an
opening to theories beyond the MSSM, explaining that this latter model
is not at all the end of the story for SUSY phenomenology, by
introducing the famous @xmath –problem in the MSSM.

#### 9.1 Fields content: Higgs and SUSY sectors of the MSSM

The sections 8.2 and 8.3 have introduced all the elements that are
necessary for the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard
Model, called the MSSM. We will give in this subsection all the
superfields of the MSSM together with the soft SUSY breaking part of the
lagrangian.

##### 9.1.1 Superfields and (super)particles content

The MSSM is still based on the Lie algebra @xmath . We will then
introduce twelve vector superfields: the three @xmath superfields @xmath
, the hypercharge superfield @xmath and the eight @xmath superfields
@xmath .

All the chiral superfield are left handed in the MSSM. We will then
introduce

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the right–handed singlet leptons are represented by the chiral
superfields @xmath containing @xmath and @xmath ⁶⁴ ⁶⁴ 64 The bar
notation does not mean any (hermitian) conjugation, it is rather a
notation in order to remind the reader that we deal with the charge
conjugate of the original spinor, as we deal with left chiral superfield
only. . In this way all the chiral superfields are left–handed, which
will be useful for the writing of the superpotential. We have the
following chiral superfields for the quarks:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the same rule presented for the leptonic superfields also apply
for the quark superfields. The index @xmath runs from 1 to 3, labeling
the generations.

We finally introduce the Higgs superfield, but in the context of the
MSSM we have two Higgs superfields @xmath and @xmath . We will review in
the next subsection (some of) the reasons to introduce more than one
Higgs superfield, but it can already be noted that for consistency
reason due to the analyticity of the superpotential, we should have one
Higgs superfield devoted to the coupling to up–type quarks and another
Higgs superfield devoted to the coupling to down–type quarks, as we
cannot take the charge conjugate of only one Higgs field as in the case
of the SM; otherwise we would break the analyticity of the
superpotential. We thus have two @xmath @xmath superfields doublets,
@xmath with hypercharge +1 and @xmath with hypercharge -1:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

We list in the Table 10 below the new superparticles and Higgs fields in
the MSSM in addition to the usual SM fields. It should be noted that by
construction the higgsinos and gauginos are four–component Majorana
spinors, thus their own charge conjugate.

After electroweak symmetry (and SUSY) breaking the Higgs and the
gauginos/higgsinos sectors are affected by mixing between the different
gauge eigenstates. We finally obtain 2 @xmath –even neutral Higgs bosons
@xmath , one @xmath –odd neutral Higgs boson @xmath and two charged
Higgs bosons @xmath ; four neutral gauginos @xmath called the
neutralinos and four charged gauginos @xmath called the charginos. This
is summarized in Table 11 below:

The ratio between the two Higgs vacuum expectation values (vev) @xmath
and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

is a fundamental parameter in the MSSM controlling much of its
phenomenology as will be seen later on for example when dealing with
Higgs production in the MSSM. We will discuss in more details the Higgs
sector in the next subsection.

##### 9.1.2 The MSSM lagrangian

We are now ready to write down the MSSM lagrangian using all the
superfields listed above, following the formal techniques described in
the previous section 8 . We will separate the lagrangian in the SUSY
invariant part and the soft SUSY breaking part:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

with

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.6)
                                         
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

where @xmath is a gauge index, @xmath are the three @xmath generators
acting on the @xmath representations, @xmath are the eight @xmath
generators acting on the @xmath representations and @xmath their complex
conjugates acting on the @xmath representations. @xmath is the MSSM
superpotential which is governed by gauge invariance and @xmath –parity.
Indeed in the SM both @xmath and @xmath are conserved, thus the natural
assumption of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM is to
assume @xmath –parity which is related to the @xmath invariance. The
superpotential contains both the Yukawa interactions and the SUSY
invariant scalar potential, and then reads [ 284 ] :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath for @xmath as @xmath indices and @xmath . From this
superpotential we can extract the SUSY invariant scalar potential that
will be introduced in the next subsection when dealing specifically with
the Higgs sector of the MSSM.

The last piece that remains is the soft SUSY breaking part. We start
from the general lagrangian in Eq. 8.28 , retaining only the gauge and
@xmath –parity invariant terms, in particular we discard the tadpole
terms as the MSSM does not contain any gauge singlet. It eventually
reads

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.8)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

where the fields have been defined in Table. 10 and with @xmath , @xmath
being the left and right chiral projectors. The repeted gauge index
@xmath are summed implicitely. @xmath are the complex Majorana gauginos
SUSY breaking mass parameters, @xmath are the real Higgs SUSY breaking
mass parameters. The sleptons and squarks mass parameters are @xmath
hermitian matrices. Finally the trilinear couplings @xmath are @xmath
complex matrices of mass dimension; the @xmath parameter is real and is
also of mass dimension.

If one counts all the new parameters, the general (or unconstrained)
MSSM has 134 new parameters. This huge parameter space needs to be
reduced to allow for viable phenomenological studies: that is the case
in the constrained versions of the MSSM (cMSSM) where some assumptions
such as no @xmath –violating mass matrices, mass unification at GUT
scale, universality of the two first generations of squarks and
sleptons, etc. As the origin of many new parameters lies in the soft
SUSY breaking part of the MSSM, many phenomenological studies assume a
definite SUSY breaking scheme at higher scale, such as the mSUGRA
scheme, that induces the soft SUSY breaking parameters through
renormalisation group evolution (RGE) of the parameters down to the weak
scale. In such constrained version of the MSSM, everything is typically
controlled by four parameters:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the common scalar mass, @xmath is the common gaugino
mass, @xmath is the common trilinear coupling, @xmath is the vev ratio
and @xmath is the sign of the invariant SUSY parameter @xmath .

##### 9.1.3 Some experimental constraints on the sparticles masses

We end this subsection by giving some experimental limits to the mass of
the yet--to--be--observed sparticles. These limits have been obtained at
the LEP, Tevatron ⁶⁵ ⁶⁵ 65 For the LEP and Tevatron searches, see the
review in Ref. [ 211 ] . We have taken the PDG limits [ 205 ] for these
experiments. and very recently LHC colliders in the ATLAS [ 306 , 307 ]
and CMS [ 308 , 309 ] experiments. The limits are usually given within
the cMSSM, that is assuming @xmath –parity, gauginos mass unification at
the GUT scale, first and second generations universality in the squark
sector along with the condition @xmath . We have at 95%CL:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath               
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.10)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Apart from the lightest neutralino, these limits assume @xmath . We also
have for the gluinos

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath               (9.11)
                       @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The squarks limits strongly depends on the parameter space point.
Nevertheless the gross limit either at LEP/Tevatron or at the LHC points
out to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

which can be loosen for the stop and sbottom masses:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

The limits on the sleptons use the same assumptions as for the charginos
and neutralinos and read:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 9.2 The Higgs sector and the number of Higgs doublets

After having presented the full MSSM we move on to a more detailed
analysis of its Higgs sector that will be discussed at hadron colliders
in the next part IV . We first remind the reason to introduce two Higgs
doublet instead of the minimal choice in the SM; we then present the
Higgs scalar potential in the MSSM and the electroweak symmetry
breaking, intimately connected to that of SUSY; we end by presenting the
masses and couplings of the MSSM Higgs bosons.

##### 9.2.1 The number of Higgs doublet in the MSSM

We have already presented one reason to introduce two Higgs doublets
within the MSSM. Indeed the mathematical formulation of the MSSM
requires that the superpotential, encoding all the SUSY invariant
interactions between the chiral superfields that represent the fermions
and their sfermions superpartners, to be a holomorphic expression of
these superfields. In particular this means that there will be no @xmath
term that was used in the case of the SM to give rise to up–type quark
using the @xmath field. In other words, @xmath and @xmath @xmath
representations are not equivalent in SUSY theories contrary to the case
of the SM.

Even if we were not to look for a way to give a mass to fermions we
would require two Higgs doublets. Indeed, we know that the SM is free
frome gauge anomalies and in particular the Adler–Bardeen–Jackiw
anomalies originating from triangular fermionic loops with axial–vector
current couplings [ 310 ] . Gauge anomalies would be disastrous,
spoiling the renormalizability and the gauge identities, but the fact
that the sum of the hypercharges of all the fifteen chiral fermions (or
charges, related to hypercharges through the Gell–Mann–Nishijima
relation, see section 1.2 ) is zero in the SM explains the vanishing of
these chiral anomalies, @xmath . In the MSSM, SUSY introduces new
fermions in the theory as superpartners of the standard bosons, in
particular in the higgsino sector. If we were to have only one Higgs
doublet with a definite hypercharge, we would be left with the charged
higgsino not cancelled by anything in the trace sum rule and thus the
anomaly cancellation would be spoiled. With two doublets of Higgs fields
with opposite hypercharge, the cancellation of chiral anomalies still
takes place [ 311 ] .

We now have two solid reasons to introduce two Higgs doublet within the
MSSM, making the minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM a particular
case of 2 Higgs doublet models (2HDM), more precisely a 2HDM of type II,
see Ref. [ 44 ] for a review. We will now sketch the electroweak
symmetry breaking within the MSSM.

##### 9.2.2 The electroweak symmetry breaking in the MSSM

We recall that we use the following Higgs doublets:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

We first need to write down the Higgs scalar potential in the MSSM. We
break the potential into a SUSY invariant part and a soft part

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath comes from the superpotential 9.7 and the gauge @xmath
–terms while @xmath comes from the soft SUSY breaking lagrangian in Eq.
9.8 . We then have [ 211 , 285 ] :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
                       @xmath            
                       @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.17)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

We want that the minimum of the scalar potential @xmath breaks @xmath
down to @xmath . Without any loss of generality we can assume that
@xmath at the minimum using the freedom of a gauge @xmath rotation.
Together with the minimization equation @xmath we obtain @xmath , a
result that could have been predicted as the vacuum should not break
@xmath thus not being charged. We are left with:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath and @xmath real positive numbers. A @xmath rotation of the
fields @xmath and @xmath can make @xmath as a real positive number too,
thus the potential does conserve @xmath at tree–level.

The pattern of the vacuum expectation value is more complicated than
compared to the SM case as we now have two vacuum expectation values
(vev) @xmath and @xmath . The coupling of the Higgs doublets to the
gauge bosons remain as in the SM case, thus we can define the weak
bosons masses to be the same as in the SM case, that is:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.19)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

SUSY being broken the scalar potential is not always positive. @xmath
must be bounded from below to develop a vev; along the so–called @xmath
–flat direction @xmath the quartic term vanishes and the stability
requirement thus imposes the following condition [ 284 , 211 , 285 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

This relation must hold at any perturbative order, that is even in the
case where the coefficients become running quantities. In addition we
need to be sure that a linear combination of the two neutral Higgs
fields has a negative mass squared term in order to have spontaneous
electroweak symmetry breaking. The mass matrix is @xmath and the
quadratic part of @xmath reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

and its trace being positive because of Eq. 9.20 its determinant must be
negative:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

If not the stable minimum is along the @xmath –flat direction @xmath .
The very interesting remark is that the two conditions 9.20 and 9.22 are
not fulfilled if @xmath and in particular if these two soft SUSY
breaking terms vanish. This means that the electroweak symmetry breaking
in the MSSM requires that SUSY be broken: there is a deep connection
between SUSY and electroweak symmetry breakings. Furthermore the
electroweak symmetry breaking can be driven radiatively: starting from a
very high energy input scale where @xmath (even equal to zero before
SUSY breaking in the hidden sector), RGE evolution with the top/stop and
bottom/sbottom contributions does lift the degeneracy, ending with
@xmath or @xmath . This is known as the radiative electroweak symmetry
breaking [ 312 , 313 , 314 ] which is a very elegant way to obtain a
gauge symmetry breaking, not having imposed at first the negative value
of the squared mass in the scalar potential.

##### 9.2.3 The masses and couplings of the MSSM Higgs bosons

###### Charged Higgs, @xmath–even and @xmath–odd neutral Higgs masses

We have seen in the previous subsection the Higgs scalar potential of
the MSSM which controls the electroweak symmetry breaking. We will now
diagonalize the equation 9.17 to obtain the physical Higgs bosons
states.

We will expand the Higgs fields around the minimum @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

where this time all the fields but those of the charged are reals (we
use the same notation for the full fields and the expanded fields, but
there should be no confusion from now on).

The first step is to expand the scalar potential at the minimum only,
which gives

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have @xmath and @xmath . Using @xmath this gives the two
consistency conditions below:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.25)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

when we have used @xmath and @xmath together with the expression of
@xmath in term of SM vacuum expectation value @xmath . The consistency
conditions of Eq. 9.25 implies a reduction of the number of free
parameters in the Higgs sector.

We rewrite the scalar potential of Eq. 9.17 in terms of the real fields:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.26)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

We will now read each quadratic part of the potential depending on our
interest in the @xmath –even neutral Higgs bosons @xmath , the @xmath
–odd neutral Higgs bosons @xmath or the charged Higgs bosons @xmath .

1.  @xmath –odd Higgs boson @xmath :

    We read the quadratic part in Eq. 9.26 :

      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.27)
                                    @xmath   
                           @xmath   @xmath   
                           @xmath   @xmath   
      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

    where we have used in the last line the two consistency conditions
    in Eq. 9.25 . The vanishing determinant together with the
    non–vanishing trace implies a neutral Goldstone boson (which
    combines with the @xmath boson to give its mass) and a massive
    @xmath –odd Higgs boson @xmath . We then have

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (9.28)
      -- -------- -- --------

    In the unitarity gauge the Goldstone boson disappears as in the SM
    case.

2.  @xmath –even Higgs bosons @xmath :

    We do the same exercice from Eq. 9.26 with the real components of
    the neutral Higgs fields:

      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.29)
                                    @xmath   
                           @xmath   @xmath   
      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

    with @xmath being the following mass matrix

      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.30)
                           @xmath   @xmath   
      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

    where in the last line we have used both the consistency conditions
    of Eq. 9.25 and the result of Eq. 9.28 on the @xmath –odd Higgs mass
    @xmath . The determinant of the mass matrix does not vanish, meaning
    that the spectrum contains two physical @xmath –even Higgs bosons
    conventially named @xmath for the lightest and @xmath for the
    heaviest. The rotation matrix is more complicated than in the @xmath
    –odd case. Together with the physical masses we have

      -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.31)
      -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

    with the mixing angle @xmath given by

      -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.32)
      -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

3.   Charged Higgs boson @xmath :

    We end with the charged Higgs boson mass matrix. From Eq. 9.26 we
    read:

      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.33)
                                    @xmath   
                                    @xmath   
                           @xmath   @xmath   
      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

    with @xmath being the following charged Higgs matrix

      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.34)
                           @xmath   @xmath   
      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

    Again the vanishing determinant and the non–vanishing trace signal a
    pair of Goldstone bosons @xmath (which give the mass to the charged
    @xmath bosons) and two physical charged Higgs bosons @xmath . The
    rotation matrix is the same as in the case of the @xmath –odd Higgs
    boson and we have

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (9.35)
      -- -------- -- --------

At tree–level we then have two parameters only which control the Higgs
sector: the vevs ratio @xmath and the @xmath –odd Higgs boson mass
@xmath . All the other masses and mixing angles (and also couplings, see
below) follow from these two inputs. We also have a strong hierarchy in
the spectrum and in particular @xmath . However it is well known that
the radiative corrections (hopefully!) enhance the MSSM Higgs bosons
masses (see Ref. [ 211 ] for a review): indeed we have stop/top
contribution which increases the lightest Higgs boson and according to
Ref. [ 285 ] we have at the one–loop order

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

which helps having the lightest Higgs boson @xmath above the LEP bound
@xmath GeV as often the Higgs boson @xmath is SM–like, thus bounded by
the experimental SM limits. Including all known corrections up to
three–loops order (see Refs. 185 to 194 in Ref. [ 285 ] for some of
them) we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath GeV (see Ref. [ 211 ] page 68). Direct searches at LEP have
also put the followings lower bounds [ 315 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Higgs bosons couplings to fermions

Due to the huge number of new states in the MSSM, we will not give the
full list ⁶⁶ ⁶⁶ 66 The full list is available in standard textbooks and
reviews, see e.g. Refs. [ 284 , 211 ] . . As we are interested in the
Higgs production at hadron colliders in the main channels, we will
simply give the couplings that are of interest to our goal: the
couplings of the Higgs bosons to fermions.

We recall that the Yukawa interactions come directly from the
superpotential @xmath through (in four–components notation):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the MSSM superpotential written in Eq. 9.7 and introducing the
chiral projector operators @xmath we have for the first generation [ 211
] , the scheme being repeted for the other two:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.40)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

In the lagrangian 9.40 above we have used the full Higgs fields without
any expansion around the minimum. The fermion masses are generated when
the neutral components of the Higgs fields acquire their vacuum
expectation values; they read in terms of the Yukawa couplings, using
the expansion of Eq. 9.23 with @xmath and @xmath , @xmath being the SM
vacuum expectation value:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

We now expand the Higgs fields around their vevs using the physical
fields expressed with Eqs. 9.28 , 9.31 , 9.35 :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.42)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

with @xmath the CKM matrix element which is present in the case of the
quarks. The lagrangian of Eq. 9.42 is repeted for the two other
generations and has the same structure. The MSSM Higgs boson couplings
to fermions are thus given by

  -- -------- -- -------- --
     @xmath      @xmath   
     @xmath      @xmath   
  -- -------- -- -------- --

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.43)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

What can be noted from these couplings? First we have to say that
directly for the charged Higgs bosons @xmath and the pseudoscalar @xmath
boson their couplings to up–type fermions ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath
quarks) are suppressed as @xmath grows whereas their couplings to
down–type fermions ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath quarks and charged
leptons) are greatly enhanced. This has a great inpact on MSSM Higgs
production at colliders as will be seen in the next part IV , as in the
heavy quarks sector we have a very strong coupling between the @xmath
boson and the bottom quark whereas the @xmath coupling is strongly
suppressed. This side remark is also true for the @xmath –even Higgs
bosons @xmath , as if we rescale their couplings to those of the SM we
have:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.44)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

which means that (though depending of the magnitude of @xmath or @xmath
) the @xmath coupling of either the @xmath or @xmath boson are enhanced
(suppressed) by a factor @xmath .

#### 9.3 The MSSM is not the end of the story

This last subsection will close the presentation of the MSSM and is
intended as a door opened to theories beyond the minimal supersymmetric
extension of the SM. Indeed it is well known that the MSSM suffers from
difficulties even if it solves many problems within the SM, some having
been highlighted in section 7 . It then should be fair to present the
limitations of this thesis and to put in perspectives the beauty of the
MSSM.

One of the celebrated issues is the so–called “ @xmath problem” which
can be traced as a naturalness issue. Indeed, let us start with the two
equalities in Eq. 9.25 which have to be fullfilled to obtain a
consistent electroweak vacuum. These can be rewritten as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.45)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The two equalities in Eq. 9.45 above highlight the @xmath –problem:
@xmath being soft SUSY breaking terms they are at most two orders of
magnitude of @xmath , which means that on the overall @xmath has to be
of the order of the soft SUSY breaking terms and cannot be null in order
to have a correct electroweak symmetry breaking. This is unnatural as
@xmath is a SUSY invariant term which then is naturally of the order of
the highest scale of the theory, that are either the GUT scale where
SUSY is broken or even the Planck scale. What is the mechanism which
forces a SUSY invariant parameter to be of the same order of the soft
terms ⁶⁷ ⁶⁷ 67 One might argue that this is a rather subjective argument
to go beyond the MSSM, Nature being perhaps “unnatural”. However one of
the arguments to introduce supersymmetry is precisely the naturalness
argument applied on the Higgs boson mass. It would be rather strange to
reject the naturalness argument on the one hand and to accept it on the
other hand. ?

One (elegant) solution is to introduce a new singlet superfield @xmath
in the theory, which then extends to the NMSSM for Next–to–MSSM [ 316 ,
317 ] which was actually born even before the MSSM. Two new couplings
@xmath and @xmath are introduced in the lagrangian and the
superpotential reads

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.46)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

the trilinear @xmath term is necessary to prevent the NMSSM lagrangian
to possess a @xmath symmetry which would lead to domain walls in
cosmology. An effective @xmath term is generated when @xmath acquires a
vev:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is then naturally of the order of the soft SUSY breaking terms,
thus solving the @xmath –problem. The soft SUSY breaking terms read

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

The phenomenology is richer than in the MSSM. Indeed the new singlet
superfield adds two Higgs fields and two Higgsino fields, which mix with
other fields to end up with [ 318 , 319 ] :

1.  3 @xmath –even Higgs bosons @xmath ;

2.  2 @xmath –odd Higgs bosons @xmath , @xmath ;

3.  5 neutralinos @xmath .

The lightest neutralino can be singlino–like, affecting the dark matter
searches. The next–to–lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) can be
charged, ending up with long–lived @xmath tracks thus being a golden
signal for the NMSSM ⁶⁸ ⁶⁸ 68 This can also happen in the MSSM with
gauge–mediated SUSY breaking though. . All these features are reviewed
in Ref. [ 320 ] ; it is worth mentioning that adding this new singlet in
the theory reduces the MSSM fine–tuning, that is the requirement of
having large corrections to the lightest MSSM Higgs boson in order to
cross the @xmath value. Indeed the NMSSM lightest Higgs boson can be
very light in the case of large singlet composition thus evading the LEP
bounds, and the SM–like boson can be heavier than in the case of the
MSSM.

We end this perspectives subsection by mentioning that the constrained
version of the NMSSM (cNMSSM) can be very predictive: if all the
experimental constraints are taken into account and in particular the
WMAP constraints on the dark matter density, the cNMSSM can be described
in practice by a single parameter as shown in Ref. [ 321 ] and depicted
in Fig. 51 below.

We have now ended the sketch of the MSSM and its essential features in
the view of our goal, that is the study of the MSSM Higgs bosons
production and decay at hadron colliders. We will now enter in the core
of this study by moving on part IV .

## Part IV MSSM Higgs(es) production and decay

### 10 The MSSM Higgs sector at hadron colliders

Part III was devoted to a brief summary of the reasons to go beyond the
SM and in particular why SUSY is appealing. It has introduced the MSSM,
the minimal extension of the SM, in which the Higgs phenomenology is
particularly rich with five Higgs bosons in the spectrum. The purpose of
this last part of the thesis is to study the MSSM Higgs bosons
production and decay at the two major hadron colliders in activity,
which will grossly reproduce the same outlines as done in part II .

We have seen in sections 9.1 and 9.2 the Higgs content of the MSSM; we
need to study in this section how the Higgs couplings to fermions are
affected by specific SUSY corrections which are in addition to that of
the standard QCD and electroweak. We will then deduce from this analysis
that the modelisation that we chose for the Higgs bosons production and
decay will be somewhat model independent in the sense that it will
hardly depend from the GUT scale parameters, wether it would be that of
minimal supergravity, anomaly mediation or gauge mediation.

#### 10.1 SUSY corrections to Higgs couplings to fermions

We have presented in section 9.2 the tree–level analysis of the Higgs
sector of the MSSM. The need for quite large radiative corrections to
the Higgs bosons masses is illustrated by the tree–level upper bound for
the lightest @xmath –even Higgs boson @xmath , @xmath . As this scalar
boson has not been observed at LEP2 this limit should be crossed with
the MSSM radiative corrections that also affect the Higgs couplings to
