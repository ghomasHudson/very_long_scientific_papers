     @xmath      (7.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

In explicit calculations one needs to know the Killing spinors of the
asymptotic vacuum and the field configuration at hand to be able to
evaluate @xmath .

It is then clear how the calculation of the supercharge anticommutators
proceeds. The quantity @xmath can be explicitly found via the Poisson
(Dirac) brackets of the fundamental fields. It will result in a field
dependent boundary integral that again includes the supersymmetry
parameters @xmath and is fixed by the lagrangian. For a given asymptotic
vacuum with known Killing spinor, one can then evaluate

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

The (bosonic) matrix @xmath now depends on the asymptotic vacuum and on
the field configuration at hand. Every vacuum defines its own different
superalgebra, where the anticommutator of the abstract quantities @xmath
is given in terms of bosonic conserved charges, coming from the bosonic
symmetries of the lagrangian. The eigenvalue equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

produces a matrix of bosonic symmetry eigenvalues @xmath for each field
configuration @xmath . Since it is a square of a hermitean operator, we
further require @xmath to be positive definite for each field
configuration that asymptotes to the given vacuum. The inequality

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

is the BPS bound for the corresponding vacuum. It projects out all
negative norm states and keeps the states that are stably asymptotic to
the vacuum state.
