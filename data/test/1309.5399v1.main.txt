# Declaration

This dissertation is the result of my own work and includes nothing
which is the outcome of work done in collaboration except where
specifically indicated in the text. Nevertheless, following the tendency
of modern research in Theoretical Physics, most of the material
discussed in this dissertation is the result of research in a
collaboration network. In particular, chapters 2 and 3 , and part of 4 ,
are based on work done in collaboration with Clare Burrage and David
Seery, published in Ref. [ 1 ] , and chapter 4 also contains material
discussed in Ref. [ 2 ] in collaboration with David Seery. Chapter 5 is
strongly based on Ref. [ 3 ] , which is the result of my own work,
whereas chapter 6 is the result of work done in collaboration with Nazim
Bouatta, Anne-Christine Davis and David Seery and published as Ref. [ 4
] . I have made major contributions to the above, both in terms of
results and writing.

I hereby declare that my thesis entitled

Aspects of Inflation and the Very Early Universe
is not substantially the same as any that I have submitted for a degree
or diploma or other qualification at any other University. I further
state that no part of my thesis has already been or is being
concurrently submitted for any such degree, diploma or any other
qualification.

I further declare that this copy is identical in every respect to the
soft-bound volume examined for the Degree, except that any alterations
required by the Examiners have been made.

In either case the idea is quite staggering. \qauthor Sir Arthur C.
Clarke

## Chapter 1 Introduction

The universe is an incredibly fascinating subject of study. Ever since
we gained the ability of logical thinking we have been staring at the
sky bewildered by the enormous amount of space out there. It is in the
cosmos that we find the oldest and longest journey of all times: that of
the primordial perturbation.

The first major discovery in cosmology over the last century was due to
Edwin Hubble who observed that galaxies were moving apart from each
other: the further away they were the larger the speed of separation
from us. We learned the universe was not static, but expanding. After
this discovery much of the work in cosmology was theoretical. In the
last few decades, however, this has changed since a remarkable
collection of high-precision satellites was assembled. In the last two
decades, our knowledge of the universe has grown tremendously as we have
become acquainted with its extraordinary history. There are essentially
two important events that allowed this to happen.

First, the launch of the COBE (COsmic Background Explorer) satellite ¹ ¹
1 http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/cobe/ , April 2012. in 1989
established the beginning of measurements of the Cosmic Microwave
Background Radiation [ 12 ] , which we refer to as the CMBR from now on.
The CMB was first discovered accidentally by Penzias & Wilson in 1965,
who collected the Nobel Prize in 1978. This breakthrough triggered many
questions about the CMBR properties.

{figwindow}

[0,1, [] , CMB 2-year data showing the temperature anisotropies in the
microwave sky (image courtesy of the COBE official website).]
Measurements of the CMBR are purely statistical, and so is our knowledge
of the universe in its infancy. COBE performed the very first
measurements of the anisotropies of the CMBR, as small as 1 part in
1,000, in a background radiation of roughly 2.7K. With COBE we learned
that the CMBR has an almost perfect black-body spectrum.

It was with the follow-up mission of WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe) ² ² 2 http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/ , April 2012. ,
launched in 2001, that the details of the statistics of the CMBR became
known. By comparing figures 1.1 and 1.2 we appreciate the amazing
improvement of precision in temperature measurements. The details of the
colour map in the second figure are undeniable evidence of the
extraordinary advances in observational cosmology.

{figwindow}

[0,1, [] , 7-year WMAP data of the microwave sky (image courtesy of
NASA/WMAP science team).] These statistics are much more than just
numbers. They encode detailed information about the early universe. They
are remnants of an early, hot, violent epoch imprinted in the microwave
radiation—they reflect the microphysics of the early universe.

With the launch of WMAP we entered the high-precision era of cosmology,
and the story of fluctuations went from being purely theoretical to
become observationally quantitative. This understanding builds up the
early universe cosmology .

Second, observations starting in 1998 from supernovae type IA showed
that the universe today is undergoing an accelerated expansion [ 13 , 14
, 15 ] . As standard candles, these supernovae are important tools to
measure cosmological distances, which made this discovery possible. This
was a rather unexpected result. We would naturally expect that all the
matter in the universe would cause the expansion to slow down.

To explain this strange behaviour we have put forward the existence of a
mysterious force that, against gravity, drives cosmological structures
apart, faster and faster. To understand this “dark energy” component in
the Cosmos is one of the main goals of the late universe cosmology .

It is no accident that both these events have earned the recognition of
the Nobel Committee. Both branches of cosmology have brought together a
global effort to understand our universe’s history, from the early times
to today. In this thesis we will focus on the universe at early times.

The CMBR is the oldest memory of the 13.7 billion year-old universe we
live in. It is indeed the only fossilized record of microphysics in the
early universe which shows evidence of a young, vibrant universe. The
CMBR is the first light in the universe and its fantastic journey
started at the surface of last scattering, when the universe was about
@xmath years old. We measure the anisotropies in the CMBR as
fluctuations in temperature, against an almost uniform temperature
field. The statistics in the temperature field can in turn be used to
trace back what mechanism generated them. To understand the origin of
these fluctuations in the temperature field, we need to discuss
inflation .

### 1.1 FLRW cosmology

Cosmology is based on the simple observation that the universe at large
scales is roughly homogeneous and isotropic. This is known as the
Cosmological Principle . To describe it we assume a
Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker space-time, given by the line
element

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the cosmological time, @xmath is the scale factor,
@xmath measures the spatial curvature, and @xmath denotes the line
element of a 2–sphere. The spatial sections of the 4-dimensional metric
( 1.1 ) are homogeneous and isotropic. This asserts that wherever we
look in the sky, at large scales, we observe more or less the same
temperature field distributions. Different values of curvature @xmath
correspond to different geometries: @xmath corresponds to flat space,
@xmath corresponds to a 3–dimensional hyperboloid, and @xmath
corresponds to a 3–sphere. In Cartesian coordinates, for @xmath , the
line element above reduces to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Conventions .—In this thesis we use Greek letters @xmath to denote
space-time indices, whereas Roman letters @xmath are used for spatial
indices. Equations are written in natural units, @xmath , and the
reduced Planck mass, @xmath , is set to unity. The space-time metric is
written as @xmath and the signature is mostly plus @xmath . @xmath
denotes the space-time covariant derivative, and @xmath represents a
spatial derivative. Dots denote differentiation with respect to
cosmological time, whilst primes denote differentiation with respect to
conformal time (except when explicitly said otherwise).

It is usually assumed that the content of the universe can be
represented by a perfect fluid. The energy-momentum tensor for a perfect
fluid with energy density @xmath and pressure density @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the 4-velocity of the fluid. If such fluid is at rest in
a geometry given by Eq. ( 1.1 ), and obeys the equation of state @xmath
, then from the covariant conservation of the energy-momentum tensor, we
can find that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the Hubble parameter which quantifies the rate of growth
of the scale factor.

The solution to the continuity equation ( 1.4 ) is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

For pressure-free matter, as the universe expands the energy density is
diluted @xmath , whereas for radiation @xmath . An interesting behaviour
occurs for @xmath , which corresponds to a fluid with negative pressure.
In this case, the energy density is constant as the universe changes
size. Nothing we know on Earth behaves this way. We will come back to
this odd feature shortly.

The dynamics of the scale factor is controlled by Friedmann’s equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

which depends on the total energy density and on the curvature of the
spatial slices. Eqs. ( 1.4 ) and ( 1.6 ) are the fundamental equations
for the dynamics of the scale factor, and imply Raychaudhuri’s equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

For a universe mostly made of baryonic matter it is clear that the
expansion has a negative acceleration. However, the present accelerated
expansion means that the energy density of the universe is dominated by
atypical matter, so that @xmath . This determines the equation of state
of a fluid which generates repulsive gravity.

Energy density parameter .—To consider several possible contributions to
the energy density in the universe, it is common to define the density
parameter

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the critical energy density for which the universe is
flat. From Eq. ( 1.6 ) we find that @xmath . We can write the total
density parameter as a sum over the contributions from the individual
fluids which build up the total energy density in the universe:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

In terms of this parameter, the Friedmann equation takes the form

  -- -- -- --------
           (1.10)
  -- -- -- --------

where we are using the usual subscript ‘ @xmath ’ to denote evaluation
at the present time, when by convention @xmath . Above we defined @xmath
to be the density parameter of the curvature. Evaluating this equation
today, we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

This has a simple consequence: if the curvature of the universe is
observationally very small, that means that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

Writing the equations in terms of @xmath will prove to be particularly
useful when discussing the flatness problem of the Hot Big Bang
paradigm.

Conformal time .—It is often convenient to define conformal time

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

which runs from @xmath to @xmath . In these coordinates, the beginning
of time @xmath corresponds to taking the limit when @xmath tends to
@xmath . In terms of this time variable, the comoving distance travelled
by a particle corresponds to the distance measured as if we neglected
the expansion of the universe. Light rays will propagate in straight
lines in the @xmath space at 45º. In this case, the geometry in flat
FLRW space becomes much simpler

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

We see that the metric tensor @xmath is conformally related to the
Minkowski metric, @xmath , via the scale factor, @xmath , which is
evolving in time.

In conformal time, Friedmann’s equation becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

and Raychaudhuri’s equation can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the prime denotes derivative with respect to conformal time and
@xmath is the Hubble parameter defined in conformal time.

### 1.2 Big Bang Model

Homogeneity and isotropy offer a very simple description of the universe
on large scales. However, it brings conceptual problems to the Hot Big
Bang paradigm when the universe is composed by conventional sources of
matter, which we briefly describe next.

The flatness problem .—Cosmological observations show that the universe
is approximately flat today, with @xmath being almost zero. What are the
implications of this observation? From Eq. ( 1.15 ) we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

We can show that the density parameter obeys the differential equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the deceleration parameter. This equation governs the
time evolution of the density parameter, which for non-vanishing values
of @xmath and @xmath , indicates that @xmath will generically be
different from unity, unless @xmath exactly always. Also,
differentiating Eq. ( 1.17 ) with respect to conformal time and using
Eq. ( 1.16 ), we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath today is very close to @xmath , writing @xmath , with
@xmath , the last equation takes the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

The solution to this equation is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

For fluids with @xmath , which in fact correspond to the baryonic matter
and radiation we are familiar with, a universe with vanishing curvature
presents a serious initial value problem— @xmath is not an attractor
solution. With @xmath diverging exponentially from unity, there is
nothing that stops the universe from having a large curvature.

Another way of looking at this problem is to rewrite Eq. ( 1.17 ) as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

We observe that @xmath indeed grows away from unity unless @xmath is
fine-tuned to be extremely close to @xmath initially (under the
assumption that the strong energy condition ³ ³ 3 The strong energy
condition asserts that @xmath . , @xmath , is obeyed). A conservative
approach based on observations of our universe today, suggests that at
the time of the Big Bang nucleosynthesis [ 16 ]

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Whilst it is possible that @xmath started extraordinarily close to
@xmath , it does require fine-tuning if the universe is dominated by
baryonic matter and radiation–this is the essence of the flatness
problem .

The horizon problem .—Wherever we look in the sky, the temperature is
almost the same, up to very small differences. But why? Looking at two
points which are separated by an angular distance larger than 2º, these
points could not have been in causal contact and therefore they could
have not shared any information. Yet, their temperature is almost the
same.

To understand this problem better, it is useful to phrase the discussion
in terms of the comoving particle horizon . This is defined as the
maximum comoving distance light could have travelled since the universe
was born, when @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

It follows that events cannot be in causal contact when their distance
is larger than the diameter of the comoving particle horizon. For the
discussion that follows, it is useful to write the comoving particle
horizon in terms of the comoving Hubble radius, which evolves in time.
We rewrite Eq. ( 1.23 ) as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

From Eq. ( 1.10 ), we observe that @xmath increases monotonically in
time for @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This has a puzzling consequence: scales which are entering the horizon
now, were far outside the horizon when the universe became
transparent—so, how can causally independent regions have the same
temperature? This is the horizon problem .

The relics problem .—We know the early universe consisted of a hot,
dense plasma, which was first dominated by radiation, and latter by
baryonic matter. Tracing back the history of the universe, we would
expect all the fundamental forces in Nature—electromagnetic,
gravitational, weak and strong—to be unified. As the temperature
dropped, presumably a GUT phase transition would occur, which would
break the symmetry amongst all the forces in Nature. Such transition
would have occurred at energies of order @xmath , at which topological
defects would have been produced. These would have an energy density at
present far higher than that observed.

Since this expectation is in conflict with observations, monopoles and
cosmic strings are usually called unwanted relics. We would therefore
like to explain how these relics became so extraordinarily diluted.

### 1.3 Inflationland

Although there is still some debate about the origin of perturbations,
inflation is the most popular description of what we believe was a
dramatic event in the history of the universe. In the inflationary
picture, when the universe was just a small fraction of a second old, it
underwent a spectacular expansion phase, which pushed cosmological
scales far outside the horizon. During this period space itself was
expanding at a speed greater than that of the light. This simple idea
has important insights when we try to explain the temperature
distribution in the microwave sky.

So why is inflation such a good idea? Inflation not only provides a
mechanism by which the problems of the standard cosmological model are
ameliorated. When combined with Quantum Mechanics, it also explains the
origin of the temperature perturbations in the sky and the seeds of
large scale structure. It relates the physics of the very small and the
very large. It does this by assuming a very simple hypothesis: if the
expansion rate of the universe was accelerated,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

for at least 60 e-folds, then the comoving Hubble radius decreased in
time:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore the observable universe went from being inside to outside the
horizon by the time inflation ends.

To understand how inflation worked, we focus our attention in Eq. ( 1.23
). If, during inflation, the Hubble parameter @xmath is roughly
constant, then the comoving Hubble radius @xmath decreases in time. The
largest contribution to the integrand in Eq. ( 1.23 ) arises at early
times, when scales were in causal contact, although they do not appear
in causal contact now.

We see that the accelerated expansion of the universe requires the
strong energy condition to be broken, and that at those early times the
energy density in the universe was dominated by a fluid with equation of
state

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The original formulation of inflation was put forth by Alan Guth in 1980
[ 17 ] and marks an exploration into ‘inflationland.’ Let us see how it
can ameliorate the problems in the cosmological model.

First, the flatness problem. From Eq. ( 1.22 ) it follows that if @xmath
, then the evolution of @xmath dictates it should reach the attractor
solution @xmath . Even if the curvature in the early universe was large,
it would be greatly diluted away by the accelerated expansion.

Second, the horizon problem. This puzzle is resolved when we use the
fact that the comoving Hubble radius decreased during inflation. This
means that scales that re-enter the horizon after inflation ended, were
once inside the horizon—they were therefore once in causal contact. With
this assumption, there is no surprise in the universe being composed of
incredibly homogeneous patches even at large angular separations.

Finally, with inflation relics are naturally diluted away since the
accelerated expansion induces a dramatic decrease in the energy density
of relic particles and topological defects.

With this positive outcome of assuming that a period of inflation took
place in the early universe, let us explore this epoch more deeply. If
the Hubble parameter @xmath varies very slowly in time, then a period of
quasi-de Sitter inflation is possible. In the limit when @xmath is
strictly a constant, it follows that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

This can be described by a fluid with equation of state @xmath , and the
scalar field associated with it is called the inflaton . The inflaton is
a field whose energy density dominates the total energy density in the
early universe, and generates an exponential expansion of the scale
factor. To describe such period one usually introduces a slow-roll
parameter, defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

which must obey @xmath . For inflation to be efficient, one generically
requires at least @xmath e-folds of expansion, where the e-folding
number

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

is a measure of the expansion of the size of the universe, from @xmath
to @xmath . Its usefulness as a unit of time was first noticed in a
paper by Sasaki & Tanaka [ 18 ] . To ensure that @xmath stays very small
during inflation, one introduces a further slow-roll parameter

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is required to obey @xmath .

#### 1.3.1 A simple inflation model

Which fluid with negative pressure could have sourced inflation? It
certainly could not have been radiation or baryonic matter, for which
the pressure is positive definite. To answer this question, let us take
the simplest inflation model, involving only one scalar field, the
inflaton, which we assume is homogeneous. This model is described by

  -- -- -- --------
           (1.31)
  -- -- -- --------

In this action @xmath is only minimally coupled to the curvature of
space-time. The scalar field has a canonical kinetic term and is subject
to a self-interacting potential, @xmath . Different models have
different potentials. For now, we will assume an arbitrary @xmath .

A typical example is depicted in the following schematics. {figwindow}
[0,1, [] , Simple (small-field) inflation potential and the dynamics of
inflation.] During the slow-roll phase, the universe is inflating, and
the potential is roughly constant, @xmath . This will be true until the
potential energy of the scalar field @xmath no longer dominates the
energy density in the universe, and is unable to source an accelerated
expansion. When this happens, the inflaton field speeds up and
approaches the minimum of the potential. It then starts oscillating
about the minimum, producing matter particles in the process, if it is
coupled to other degrees of freedom. This process is called reheating ,
and we will study it in detail in chapter 6 . To understand the
slow-roll approximation better, we write the equations of motion for the
scalar field. Assuming an FLRW background ( 1.1 ), these are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

The energy-momentum tensor can be found by varying the action ( 1.31 )
with respect to the metric tensor, giving

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

Interpreting the components of the energy-momentum tensor as those of a
fluid, we find that the energy density and pressure are given by

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.34a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.34b)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

As a result, the fluid has equation of state @xmath if one neglects the
kinetic energy compared to the potential energy. Moreover, if the
potential is approximately constant then the energy density in
Friedmann’s equation ( 1.6 ) is roughly constant, sourcing a de Sitter
universe, and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

This can be interpreted upon inspection of the action ( 1.31 ). If
@xmath the energy density of the fluid acts as a cosmological constant
and effectively sources inflationary expansion. Guth referred to this as
the “ultimate free lunch” since despite the expansion of the universe,
the energy density of the fluid was kept constant, as if it were
sourcing it out of nothing.

The slow-roll approximation asserts that we can neglect the second time
derivative of the field in Eq. ( 1.32 ) compared to the first
time-derivative. Then

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

In terms of the features of the potential, we can also define the
slow-roll parameters as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.37a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.37b)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

These coincide with the definitions ( 1.28 ) and ( 1.30 ) up to
slow-roll corrections. We observe that the requirements @xmath translate
into a potential that is almost flat for a large range of @xmath ,
making its curvature very small. This is the slow-roll period
illustrated in figure 1.4.

Slow-roll inflation lasts until @xmath and the kinetic energy of the
scalar field becomes comparable to the potential energy—the potential
becomes steeper and the scalar field speeds up, as described above. It
is during the slow-roll phase that the scalar field fluctuations become
imprinted in the CMBR—we will discuss this in detail in § 1.3.3 .

#### 1.3.2 Beyond the simplest inflation models

Inflation offers a simple, dynamical solution to the cosmological
problems, but the exact mechanism driving the process of inflationary
expansion is still rather speculative. This is because the precise
physics of inflation is essentially unknown and it is a matter of
dispute whether we will ever be able to fully understand it.

Traditionally, we start with the simplest scenarios, like the action (
1.31 ). We then add more ingredients to the action and try to understand
their distinctive signatures in the CMBR in the hope to be able to
distinguish between them once appropriate observational data is
available. There are a number of ways of generalising the action ( 1.31
). In what follows we mention some of the possible extensions.

1.   inflation with modified gravity . This can be achieved by assuming
    a non-minimal coupling to the curvature scalar. These are the so
    called scalar-tensor theories, described by

      -- -- -- --------
               (1.38)
      -- -- -- --------

    where @xmath defines the Lagrangian density of the matter sector.
    This action can be rewritten in the form of Einstein’s gravity by
    performing a conformal transformation

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    where the conformal factor is appropriately chosen [ 19 ]

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    After applying this transformation to the action ( 1.38 ), we say
    the theory of gravity is written in the Einstein frame. With this
    transformation, the space-time curvature is modified and the Ricci
    scalar becomes [ 20 ]

      -- -- --
            
      -- -- --

    with @xmath being the d’Alembertian, @xmath . To write the action in
    a more canonical way, we can further apply field redefinitions

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    where @xmath . Given these transformations, the action becomes

      -- -- -- --------
               (1.39)
      -- -- -- --------

    with @xmath denoting the modified matter Lagrangian density.
    Therefore, the modification of gravity observed in the action
    through the function @xmath appears in the Einstein frame as a
    modification of the original Lagrangian of the matter sector.
    Nevertheless, whatever frame is chosen, the physics should stay the
    same. These theories have gained interest in resent years in the
    light of chameleon field theories (see, for example, Ref. [ 21 ] ).

    Other possibilities which fall under this class exist:
    Jordan–Brans–Dicke theory of gravity [ 22 ] (which also includes
    non-canonically normalized scalar fields), @xmath gravity [ 23 ]
    (which can include higher powers of the Ricci scalar), and modified
    gravity in braneworld scenarios [ 24 ] . For a recent review on
    modified gravity theories and its cosmological implications see Ref.
    [ 25 ] .

2.   inflation with non-canonical kinetic terms . This class of theories
    also goes by the name of @xmath -inflation [ 26 ] . In contrast with
    the action ( 1.31 ) it is not the potential energy of @xmath that
    supports a de Sitter phase, but rather the non-canonical structure
    of the kinetic term. The action takes the form

      -- -- -- --------
               (1.40)
      -- -- -- --------

    and it was initially proposed by Armendáriz-Picón, Damour &
    Mukhanov. Here @xmath is an arbitrary function of the field profile
    @xmath and its first derivatives through @xmath . We recover action
    ( 1.31 ) by choosing @xmath ; more generically this action
    reproduces different models for different choices of the function
    @xmath . Without loss of generality, we can write

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (1.41)
      -- -------- -- --------

    where @xmath denotes some high-energy scale. Slow-roll inflation is
    obtained when @xmath .

    This action will play an important rôle in this thesis and we will
    explore its phenomenology in detail in the subsequent chapters.
    Here, we shall only mention that it can support inflation even in
    the presence of very steep potentials. The most striking general
    feature of the non-canonical models, however, is that the
    inflationary dynamics and the consequences for observables becomes
    quite non-trivial. This corresponds to the limit @xmath in Eq. (
    1.41 ). This limit raises one concern: radiative corrections can
    induce large renormalizations of the coefficients @xmath , which can
    lead to a ill-defined quantum field theory. In this case, only if
    the theory is equipped with a protective symmetry can we escape the
    problem of radiative instability. Of all the higher derivative
    single-field models, Dirac–Born–Infeld [ 27 ] and galileon inflation
    [ 28 ] are the only established examples where non-renormalization
    theorems apply. We will be more precise about this statement in the
    subsequent chapters.

    Whether these are the only radiatively stable models is a very
    different query—we have nothing to say about this in this thesis. We
    are rather interested in understanding what are the consequences for
    observables of taking a generalised @xmath action.

3.   multi-field inflation. In this case, there are multiple sectors in
    the action in addition to the inflaton field. This is a generic
    feature of the theory when embedding inflation in a more fundamental
    parent framework, like string theory. Indeed, effective field
    theories (examples of work in this area are Refs. [ 29 , 30 , 31 ] )
    and supergravity theories (see, for example, Refs. [ 32 , 33 ] )
    usually contain multiple degrees of freedom. If all the fields play
    a rôle in the inflationary dynamics, then a single-field effective
    picture is not possible and the dynamics becomes more intricate then
    any single-field inflation model. Early studies of models involving
    more than one degree of freedom include works by Linde [ 34 ] ,
    Kofman & Linde [ 35 ] , and Silk & Turner [ 36 ] .

In this thesis we will focus on the perturbation theory of generalised
single-field models, starting from the action ( 1.40 ). We will not
attempt to investigate multi-field inflation models or modified gravity
models in the sense described above, although galileon models arise
naturally in the decoupling limit of massive gravities [ 37 , 38 , 39 ]
—we will discuss these in chapters 3 and 4 .

#### 1.3.3 Seeding perturbations

We now turn to the question of how inflation can microscopically explain
the origin of Large Scale Structure (LSS). For this we need to consider
the quantum-mechanical behaviour of the ‘single-clock’ in the universe
during inflation. Such rôle is played by the inflaton field which sets
the initial conditions for the evolution of perturbations, as originally
explained by Guth & Pi [ 40 ] , Hawking [ 41 ] , and Bardeen, Steinhardt
& Turner [ 42 ] .

Let us first revisit figure 1.4 of a typical schematics of a
single-field inflationary model. {figwindow} [0,1, [] , As inflation
proceeds, the inflaton undergoes quantum fluctuations which are the
seeds for density perturbations.] Going back to the idea that during
inflation the comoving Hubble radius decreases, then quantum
fluctuations with origin on sub-horizon scales will exit the horizon.
While on super-horizon scales, such fluctuations freeze until they are
able to re-enter the horizon at late times.

So how do the quantum fluctuations translate into fluctuations in the
density field, which can then respond to the gravitational pull and form
bound structures? Once created, the small, inhomogeneous inflaton
perturbations, @xmath , will induce slightly different arrival times of
the expectation value @xmath at the bottom of the potential @xmath . As
can be seen in the figure, regions in space where @xmath is positive
will remain potentially dominated for longer, whereas regions where
@xmath is negative will stop inflating sooner. Since @xmath is the only
available clock in the universe (in single-field models), we can say
that fluctuations @xmath control the time differences at which inflation
ends through

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

where hypersurfaces of constant time are also hypersurfaces of constant
energy density, and therefore constant @xmath . After inflation ends and
reheating proceeds, @xmath , and fluctuations in the expansion rate of
the universe are mapped into density inhomogeneities, as follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

This way, the inflaton quantum perturbations seeded structure during the
early universe, which have later grown to form galaxies and clusters.
What is most impressive still is that the small inhomogeneities produced
during inflation were imprinted in the early plasma, which cooled down
and became the CMBR after photon decoupling. Today we observe these
imprints in the microwave sky as temperature anisotropies, which produce
the beautiful map depicted in figure 1.2.

### 1.4 @xmathCDM: the concordance model

Measuring observables faces a tremendous challenge: degeneracy. Given a
set of data, different observables can compete and their effect might be
so tied up in our measurements, that it is hard to find constraints for
each individual observable. To attempt to solve for this pressing
problem, cosmologists need to have access to various, often
complementary, sets of data.

The BOOMERanG (Balloon Observations Of Millimetric Extragalactic
Radiation and Geophysics) experiment ⁴ ⁴ 4
http://cmb.phys.cwru.edu/boomerang/ , April 2012. measured in 1997 the
CMBR anisotropies, determining the value of Hubble’s constant, @xmath ,
and the fractional density of the universe, @xmath . It has also
provided evidence in agreement with supernovae data on the present
accelerated expansion, as announced in Refs. [ 43 , 44 ] . Other
experiments include SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) ⁵ ⁵ 5
http://www.sdss.org/ , April 2012. , which is a ground-based telescope,
that targets quasars and galaxies distributions, and places constraints
on the cosmological parameters.

The best fit for the content of the universe today given by WMAP and BAO
⁶ ⁶ 6 BAO stands for Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations. data [ 6 , 7 ] is
in table 1.1 . The concordance model results from a significant
component of the energy density in the universe being a cosmological
constant, hence the name @xmath CDM.

Observations indicate that the universe is made up of four basic
components: radiation, dark matter, baryonic matter, and cosmological
constant (or dark energy). The largest component is dark energy with a
proportion of about 73% of all there is. Most of the universe is made up
of something we cannot see and do not understand—we are only familiar
with 4% of the entire universe’s budget. All the matter, @xmath , in the
universe is either baryonic matter, @xmath , or cold dark matter @xmath
:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Including supernovae data, cosmologists have learnt that the dark energy
has equation of state

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The data undeniably points to a flat universe.

We have intentionally removed all the data related to the CMB
anisotropies since we will discuss it in the next chapters.

### 1.5 Planck: the ultimate ‘thermometer’

As described before, the last few decades have seen remarkable advances
in cosmology. These were only made possible owing to an unparalleled
progress in observational cosmology. In May 2009 the Planck satellite ⁷
⁷ 7 http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Planck/index.html , April 2012. was
launched in an attempt to exhaust the amount of information one could
extract from the CMB.

{figwindow}

[0,1, [] , The launch of the Planck satellite and the Herschel telescope
by Ariane 5 (image courtesy of ESA-CNES-Arianespace, Optique Vidéo du
CSG, P. Baudon).] One of the main objectives of this mission was to
enable a rigorous test of the early universe models against observation.
The sensitivity of the temperature measurements that Planck offers is
simply staggering: one part in one million. Having a direct focus on the
detection of primordial gravitational waves and specification of its
spectrum, Planck will also allow the most detailed study of the scalar
spectrum of perturbations yet performed. In particular, with Planck we
expect to obtain very precise data on the higher-point correlations of
the temperature field, which we can map backwards to draw the features
of the primordial curvature perturbation.

It is anticipated that the major problem in analysing data will be to
efficiently remove the foreground. It is therefore quite likely that
Planck will turn out to be the end of the line in the generation of
high-precision satellites. Planck will be able to distinguish between
different types of inflationary models, and it is the most promising
guide to understand the early universe. Among its many goals, it aims at
unveiling the microphysics of inflation, understanding what are the
high-energy theories beyond those imprinted in the CMBR fluctuations,
and learning more about dark energy. In particular, and focusing on
inflation theories, it might measure non-zero non-gaussianity, which is
a key observational feature since it works as a discriminator of
microphysics.

The main object of study in the next four chapters will be the
bispectrum, which is the lowest-order non-gaussian statistics component,
and therefore potentially easier to observe (than higher-point
statistics).

### 1.6 Summary of the outline of the thesis

In this thesis we explore the inflationary signatures of single-field
models, and study how the universe would have reheated after a
Dirac–Born–Infeld inflation phase. One of the key questions we aim to
address is: how can we efficiently use Planck ’s data to solve for the
degeneracy in the inflationary models? By this we mean that several,
distinct sets of parameters in a given theory can combine in such a way
so as to produce the same predictions for observables. What we would
like to know is how to build an efficient dictionary between
observations and parameters of a theory.

We start by reviewing non-gaussinities in chapter 2 , explaining how
they encode blueprints of the inflationary models. We first focus on
@xmath theories and compute the amplitude of their bispectrum to
next-order in slow-roll. We later generalise our results to the
Horndeski class of models, which includes all theories that do not have
propagating ghosts.

For some time now we suspect that the theoretical uncertainty in
estimating the bispectrum is larger than the experimental errors [ 45 ]
. If we expect to constrain the parameters of the theory using Planck ’s
data, one necessarily needs to push the theory-error down, otherwise the
advantages of having high-precision measurements are not met. This can
be done in much the same way as electroweak precision tests some decades
ago, when physicists realised that they had to control the theoretical
inaccuracy of their calculations to be able to keep pace with the
precision of their experiments (see, for example, the review by
Altarelli et al. [ 46 ] ). In chapter 3 we give a more accurate estimate
of the bispectrum, by reducing the maximum theory-error by several tens
of percent (around 95% in most cases).

In chapter 4 we present a careful analysis of the scale and
shape-dependences of the bispectrum and we elaborate on its
discriminatory power to tell inflationary models apart. We focus on
bispectrum shapes, rather than the amplitude of the bispectrum, to make
a most efficient use of empirical evidence of inflationary theories. In
chapter 2 we will see that the bispectrum depends only on a handful of
parameters, which requires finding an efficient algorithm to solve for
this degeneracy. We argue that using templates (as commonly done in CMBR
data analysis) might not be the most promising strategy to understand
the early universe microphysics.

In chapter 5 we go beyond the slow-roll approximation, and ask the
following question: what if inflation was not close to de Sitter? In
that case, one could wonder whether the inflationary signatures in the
CMBR would be different form those obtained and discussed in chapters 2
, 3 and 4 . We obtain estimates for the bispectrum under the assumption
that the spectrum of perturbations is approximately flat, consistent
with observational data. We comment on the implications for the
scale-dependence of the bispectrum in these theories, and argue this
behaviour can be explored using complementary observational tests.

Chapter 6 focuses on the study of preheating after a period of
Dirac–Born–Infeld inflation. We study how matter particles could have
been created and efficiently repopulated the universe. We comment on the
implications of the reheating temperature in such theories.

Finally, in chapter 7 we review the main findings of this thesis and
point out to possible extensions to future work. The appendices collect
important material for the developments of the chapters in the main body
of this thesis.

## Chapter 2 Non-Gaussianity in Inflationland

For a long time theoretical cosmology’s only exercise was to develop
theoretical models which would one day be put to scrutiny against
observations as working models of the early universe. We are living in
an exciting era of precision cosmology where, perhaps for the first
time, we can gather enough data with the appropriate resolution to test
those models. This data might not be able to rule out some inflation
models completely, as some degree of fine-tuning in model building can
accommodate even unfavourable data. Nevertheless, it will certainly put
some models under moderately high pressure. We will ultimately want to
know what was the physics behind inflation, if inflation did indeed
happen. Our best hope to learn about this mechanism is through
non-gaussianities.

Outline .— We start by reviewing in § 2.1 the work that has been done on
non-gaussianities, regarded as the most promising discriminator of
microphysics. This chapter therefore contains important review material,
but also original work. In § 2.2 we discuss the background model and
specify our version of the slow-roll approximation. Results involving
the lowest powers in slow-roll parameters will be called
“leading-order,” whereas those involving one extra power in slow-roll
will be referred to as “next-order,” and so forth. Our initial
discussion will be focused on @xmath models. In § 2.2.2 we recapitulate
the computation of the two-point function of perturbations (including
its explicit scale-dependence). We discuss the derivation of the
third-order action for the primordial perturbation in § 2.3 , and based
on recent developments, we extend our calculation to all single-field
models which do not contain ghost-like instabilities. We give in § 2.3.2
a brief description of the “in–in” (or Schwinger–Keldysh) formulation
for expectation values, necessary to compute correlation functions.

This chapter includes material based on work done in collaboration with
Clare Burrage and David Seery, published in Ref. [ 1 ] .

### 2.1 Understanding non-gaussianities

As we discussed in the introduction to this thesis, our picture of the
early universe has become much more precise with access to data with
unparalleled sensitivity. This has been made possible with the advent of
high-precision satellites, like WMAP and more recently Planck . If the
temperature in the microwave sky was perfectly homogeneous, there would
be little to know about the CMB, except that its spectrum was that of
blackbody radiation. Fortunately this is not the case. Below is the
microwave sky as seen by the WMAP satellite.

The colours in this picture not only say that the microwave sky does not
have the same temperature everywhere. They mainly tell us that there is
a wealth of information encoded in the CMBR which is sensitive to the
microphysics during inflation. It is in the way that the temperature in
one point correlates with that in other points that we can learn about
the inflationary mechanism. But how?

The CMBR is usually thought to have its origins in a primordial era [ 47
] governed by quantum fluctuations. For a review on the numerous
mechanisms for generation of quantum fluctuations during inflation see,
for example, the book by Lyth & Liddle [ 16 ] . During inflation,
cosmological scales were pushed outside the observable horizon. At the
same time, quantum fluctuations were allowed to grow to later become
classical far outside the horizon. In its simplest implementation,
inflation forecasts an approximately scale-invariant, Gaussian
distribution of perturbations [ 42 , 48 ] . This means that fluctuations
are only slightly stronger on larger scales (since the spectrum is
red-tilted), and they are completely characterised by their two-point
correlations (the power spectrum of perturbations). Although minimalist,
these predictions are in good agreement with present-day observations,
including WMAP 7-year data [ 49 , 7 , 6 ] .

Given the recent improvement and sophistication of CMB experiments, we
might now be able to detect non-zero three- and higher @xmath -point
correlations [ 50 , 51 ] . These are globally known as non-gaussianities
and they can be thought of as including important information about
interactions within the inflaton sector, and others, during inflation.
They are an intricate product of whatever inflationary process occurred
in the early universe. Understanding and identifying the non-gaussian
signatures in each inflationary model is comparable to producing an
inflationary fingerprint, which can be later identified in the microwave
sky. On the other hand, other constraints will soon emerge from the
non-gaussian statistics of collapsed objects, using LSS data [ 52 ] . We
therefore expect non-gaussianity constraints to arrive from different
sets of data.

In principle, valuable information is encoded in each @xmath -point
function. In practice, extracting information from the four-point
function is computationally challenging, as described in Refs. [ 53 , 54
] ; it is also unclear whether data constraints associated with higher
@xmath -point functions can ever be used efficiently as model
discriminators. For this reason, attention has focused on the
three-point correlations, also known as the bispectrum . These are most
usually cited in terms of a rescaled amplitude, @xmath [ 50 , 51 ] ,
although as we shall see in this thesis, there is a lot more information
on the bispectrum, which can and should be used to draw constraints. ¹ ¹
1 The definition of @xmath will be presented in § 3.1 . For now it
suffices to know that @xmath is a rescaled magnitude of the bispectrum.
For a Gaussian field there is no extra information on higher @xmath
-point correlators, besides the one provided by the power spectrum, and
@xmath . This is the least desirable situation, which is also not
excluded from present-day data.

Our work assumes there was only one active single scalar field, @xmath ,
during inflation and that its quantum fluctuations, @xmath , became
imprinted in the CMB. The mapping we want to establish is that between a
microphysical Lagrangian of perturbations and its correlation functions,
@xmath . Early references are the works by Starobinsky [ 55 ] , Sasaki &
Stewart [ 56 ] and Lyth & Rodríguez [ 57 ] . We now review some of the
notable developments in this area.

#### 2.1.1 Historical developments

The first calculations of correlators of quantum fluctuations @xmath
were presented shortly after the inflationary paradigm was proposed [ 42
, 40 , 41 , 58 , 59 , 60 , 61 ] . Results were obtained for the
two-point functions of single-field inflation theories with canonical
kinetic terms.

The possibility of producing non-gaussian fluctuations during inflation
was first investigated by Allen, Grinstein & Wise in 1987 [ 62 ] . The
first calculation of the three-point correlator of the temperature
anisotropy dates as early as 1992 by Falk, Rangarajan & Srednicki [ 63 ]
, followed by other partial results [ 64 , 65 ] . The complete
three-point function was laid down in 2002 by Maldacena [ 66 ] , in a
paper which set up all the subsequent calculations of the bispectrum.
Three-point correlators originated from multiple fields were originally
calculated by Seery & Lidsey [ 67 ] . Calculations of four-point
correlations first appeared in Ref. [ 68 ] by Seery, Lidsey & Sloth, and
Ref. [ 69 ] by Seery, Sloth & Vernizzi.

Maldacena’s epic calculation showed that @xmath would be unobservably
small in single-field models with canonical kinetic terms. More
precisely, @xmath , where @xmath is the tensor-to-scalar ratio,
constrained by observation to satisfy @xmath [ 6 ] . Soon cosmologists
turned their attention to more complicated realizations of single-field
theories of inflation. Two classes of possibilities emerged: in
effective field theories (see, for example, Ref. [ 70 ] ) Lagrangians
naturally contained high-order operators of derivatives of the scalar
field, suppressed by some high-energy scale; in other theories the
scalar field @xmath was not canonically normalised.

The first class of these was studied by Creminelli in 2003 [ 71 ] , who
concluded that if the dominant kinetic operator for the slowly rolling
background field was of the form @xmath , then the three-point
correlations of its perturbations were effectively indistinguishable
from Maldacena’s simplest model [ 71 ] . This analysis relied on the
slow-roll approximation. The result was that non-gaussianities in these
models would disappointingly have negligible amplitude, and could not be
used as a diagnostic tool.

Non-canonical models .—In theories where other operators than @xmath are
dominant, however, @xmath can become quite significant, depending on the
precise form of the Lagrangian of the background theory. Examples of
these more complicated scenarios are “ghost inflation” [ 72 , 73 ] , and
Dirac–Born–Infeld (DBI) action [ 74 ] . In these models the scalar field
action governing the dynamics of both background and perturbations can
be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath . The first term is the Einstein-Hilbert action involving
the space-time Ricci scalar @xmath , and @xmath is an arbitrary function
of @xmath and its first-derivatives through @xmath . Because of the
arbitrariness of @xmath , these models can accommodate non-canonical
kinetic structures.

In ghost-inflation, the kinetic term of @xmath has the wrong sign and
the action contains several @xmath contributions among higher-order
derivatives of @xmath , as follows

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are dimensionless functions of @xmath
(which is also dimensionless), @xmath is some mass-scale and @xmath
represent higher derivative operators acting on @xmath . Since this
action contains operators with more than one derivative acting on the
scalar field, it gives rise to equations of motion which contain at
least third-order derivatives of @xmath , signalling a ghost
instability. Arkani-Hamed et al.  showed that the solution of interest
takes the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is some dimensionless constant. They also showed that this
solution protects the theory against radiative corrections, even though
the action contains non-renormalisable operators.

In contrast, in DBI inflation it is the presence of a higher-dimensional
boost that protects the coefficients of the single derivative operators
from large renormalisations. The action for the background field in this
model takes the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath has units of @xmath . The kinetic structure of @xmath is
embedded in the non-analytic square root, which allows to sum an
infinite number of powers of single derivative operators. We will review
this inflation model in § 3.4.1 , and again in § 6.2 from a brane-world
perspective.

Related models based on “galileon” actions have also been obtained [ 28
, 75 , 76 , 11 ] . “One of the reasons why these models raised so much
interest was because they might leave fingerprints in the CMBR [ 77 , 78
] . " A galileon singlet owes its name to invariance under the
transformation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

for constant @xmath and @xmath , under which gradients of @xmath are
shifted by a constant. Eq. ( 2.2 ) is a space-time version of a galilean
transformation, first noticed in the Dvali–Gabadadze–Porrati (DGP) model
[ 79 , 80 ] .

Galileons have recently become popular since they can be interpreted as
longitudinal graviton modes near the decoupling limit of massive
gravity, when @xmath , while the cutoff of the theory remains fixed [ 37
, 38 , 39 ] . From Eq. ( 2.2 ) we see that the galilean symmetry
contains the shift symmetry @xmath , which means that if the background
supports a de Sitter solution, then inflation can last for many e-folds,
which can be problematic. For inflation to last 60 e-folds, the shift
symmetry needs to be broken (even if only mildly). This is typically
achieved by adding a potential. However, introducing a potential such as
@xmath will manifestly break the galilean symmetry we started with. The
absence of this special symmetry implies that the Lagrangian of the
theory is no longer protected from other galilean violating terms
generated via radiative corrections. As a result, one looses the
motivation of starting with a Lagrangian which obeys the galilean
symmetry in the first place. Nevertheless, it was shown by Burrage et
al. [ 28 ] that a non-renormalisation theorem still operates, making the
dangerous radiative corrections small. Therefore, despite these
potential problems, galileon inflation sits, alongside DBI inflation, as
one of the few known examples of a radiatively stable theory of
inflation.

More recently a number of authors have rather focused on the much milder
requirement that the Lagrangian preserved unitarity. The result would be
a sensible quantum field theory [ 81 , 75 , 76 , 82 , 83 , 84 ] , where
the Lagrangian operators give rise to equations of motion which are at
most second-order in derivatives of the field. In these theories the
galilean symmetry is lost [ 85 ] because it can no longer be realised in
a generic space-time. These theories go often by the name “ @xmath
–inflation,” although as we shall see in the end of this chapter, they
can also be called “Horndeski” models.

Models in which the dominant operator of the background kinetic
structure is different from @xmath generically fall under the name of
non-canonical theories. Eq. ( 2.1 ) was first suggested in 1999 by
Armendáriz-Picón, Damour & Mukhanov [ 26 ] , who named it “ @xmath
-inflation” when applied to inflationary cosmologies. The corresponding
two-point function for scalar perturbations was obtained in the same
year by Garriga & Mukhanov [ 86 ] . Three-point correlations induced
by ( 2.1 ) were investigated in 2004 by Gruzinov in a decoupling limit
where the mixing with gravity fluctuations could be neglected [ 87 ] ;
gravitational interactions were included in the following year by Seery
& Lidsey [ 88 ] . The bispectrum of these theories was given in
generality by Chen et al. [ 45 ] , followed by extensions to multiple
fields [ 89 , 90 , 91 ] . The four-point function was also computed by a
number of authors [ 92 , 93 , 94 , 95 , 96 , 97 ] .

#### 2.1.2 Non-gaussianities in slow-roll inflation

In this chapter we revisit actions of the form ( 2.1 ) and reconsider
the three-point function under the slow-roll approximation. We do this
for two reasons: first, we review our present understanding of the
bispectrum in @xmath theories; second, we ask whether the estimates
described in the literature are precise enough to be comparable with the
high-sensitivity data soon to be delivered by Planck .

The analyses of the @xmath -point correlators mentioned above assumed
some sort of slow-roll approximation to control their calculations,
usually by restricting their results to lowest powers of @xmath (or
other quantities of similar magnitude, such as @xmath ). We generically
expect this procedure to yield estimates accurate to a fractional error
of order @xmath , which in some models could be as large as @xmath to
@xmath . ² ² 2 In Ref. [ 98 ] (see also Ref. [ 99 ] ) the authors have
studied the most likely values for @xmath and @xmath in the context of
brane inflation models. There @xmath . We will assume @xmath can be as
large as @xmath for the purposes of illustrating how large the slow-roll
corrections to the bispectrum can become. Whenever @xmath is small, as
Maldacena showed in canonical models, this is indeed a very good
approximation.

However, in models where @xmath is numerically large this might not be
the case—a fractional error of order @xmath may be comparable to the
sensitivity of Planck ’s data, especially if the @xmath terms enter with
a relatively large coefficient. We will show this is generically what
happens in @xmath theories. In the equilateral configuration ³ ³ 3 We
will be more precise about what we mean by equilateral configuration or
template in chapter 4 . , Planck will measure @xmath with an error bar
@xmath ; future CMB experiments such as CMBPol or CoRE may even achieve
@xmath [ 100 , 101 ] . Ideally, we would like the theoretical
uncertainty in our predictions to fall below this threshold.

Next-order corrections .—In comparison to the bispectrum of
perturbations, corrections to the power spectrum at subleading order in
@xmath are well-understood. Stewart & Lyth [ 102 ] were the first to
obtain the propagator for scalar fluctuations up to second-order terms
in the slow-roll approximation. ⁴ ⁴ 4 Stewart & Lyth were obliged to
assume that the slow-roll parameter @xmath was small, thereby truncating
the slow-roll approximation accordingly. On the other hand, Grivell &
Liddle [ 103 ] dropped this assumption but were unable to obtain
analytic solutions. Their numerical results confirmed that the
Stewart–Lyth formulae were valid within a small fractional error. Gong &
Stewart [ 104 , 105 ] obtained results valid to cubic order in @xmath .
In what follows we apply the notation introduced by Lidsey et al. in
Ref. [ 106 ] : results involving the least powers in slow-roll
parameters contribute at leading-order , followed by next-order terms
which contain contributions with one extra power in slow-roll, and so
forth.

Partial results generalising Stewart & Lyth’s calculation to
non-canonical models were presented by Wei, Cai & Wang in Ref. [ 107 ] .
Chen et al. [ 45 ] computed the power spectrum to next-order in
slow-roll. How relevant are the slow-roll corrections to the bispectrum?
Chen et al. [ 45 ] calculated the bispectrum to leading-order in the
slow-roll approximation. Next-order contributions to the bispectrum were
identified and presented in terms of quadratures, which made it hard to
evaluate the corrections to @xmath at next-order in slow-roll.

Nevertheless, the cubic action for perturbations derived by Seery &
Lidsey [ 88 ] was perturbative in the amplitude of fluctuations around
the background field, but exact in slow-roll quantities. The
coefficients of each operator in the action were shown to be slow-roll
suppressed, but the derivation did not rely on the slow-roll
approximation. It follows that to get an estimate of how much next-order
terms can change the amplitude @xmath , one can evaluate a subset of
such corrections present in the coefficients of the cubic operators. If
these corrections are to be representative of the typical magnitude of
next-order terms, then this estimate can be trusted.

What do we find? In the case of DBI inflation [ 27 , 74 ] , the
next-order corrections entering the coefficients of the cubic operators
in the action for perturbations, generates a fractional correction of
@xmath in the equilateral limit. How large can this be? For @xmath
(suggested by Alishahiha, Silverstein & Tong [ 74 ] ) this can be of
order 70%. ⁵ ⁵ 5 Baumann & McAllister later suggested that the Lyth
bound [ 108 ] placed a limit on @xmath [ 109 ] . Lidsey & Huston [ 110 ]
argued that in combination with the large value of @xmath implied by
Alishahiha, Silverstein & Tong [ 74 ] (see also Ref. [ 111 ] ) this made
the ‘UV’ version of the DBI model microscopically inviable. The UV model
has other difficulties. Bean et al. [ 112 ] noted that backreaction
could invalidate the probe brane approximation, spoiling inflation.
Moreover, we recall from Refs. [ 98 , 99 ] that in brane inflation
scenarios, numerical simulations show that values of @xmath are
typically much smaller than one, and so assuming @xmath can be too
optimistic. For the purposes of making an estimate we are ignoring these
details—here, we are interested in gauging the impact of these
corrections in the results of the bispectrum. This implies that
next-order corrections to DBI can be as large as @xmath %. If @xmath is
observationally large in the equilateral mode, say between 50 and 250
(in agreement with current bounds), then the corrections can shift
@xmath as much as @xmath —this window is well within reach of Planck ’s
sensitivity. ⁶ ⁶ 6 In this estimate we are discarding for simplicity the
sign of @xmath .

Are there other compelling reasons to evaluate these corrections? So far
we described how large an effect next-order corrections can have on the
amplitude of the bispectrum. The bispectrum, however, is a much richer
object. Are there different shapes arising at next-order? Can they be
realised in an inflation model without requiring serious fine-tuning? If
so, the appearance of new shapes could provide strong evidence in favour
of @xmath theories controlling the inflationary dynamics. Can we use
next-order results to learn more about inflation?

In this chapter we introduce a precise, accurate calculation of the
slow-roll corrections. Our ultimate goal is to resolve the large
theoretical uncertainties which do not meet the high-sensitivity
standards imposed by Planck . Although next-order calculations are
likely to be sufficient for Planck , our findings suggest that
next-next-order results could be in principle required by a
fourth-generation satellite such as CMBPol or CoRE . We do not attempt
this here.

### 2.2 Single-field inflation: an overview

We consider the theory ( 2.1 )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with a homogeneous background solution given by the FLRW metric ( 1.2 ).
The corresponding Friedmann equations are

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath . The nontrivial kinetic structure of @xmath causes
fluctuations of the scalar field @xmath to propagate with phase
velocity, @xmath , different from that of light:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

In what follows we shall refer to the phase speed of fluctuations simply
as “sound speed,” although these are generically different as explained
by Christopherson & Malik in Ref. [ 113 ] . In the special case of a
canonically normalized field, we have @xmath and the fluctuations in
@xmath propagate at the speed of light. We see that in these
circumstances, the function @xmath is actually the pressure of the fluid
associated with the scalar field @xmath [cf. Eq. ( 1.34b )].

#### 2.2.1 Fluctuations

During inflation the universe quickly becomes smooth and isotropic,
making @xmath spatially homogeneous to a good approximation. At the same
time, quantum fluctuations generate small perturbations, @xmath , whose
statistics we want to calculate. Since @xmath is the only scalar field
in our model, its fluctuations must be communicated to the metric.
Therefore, for consistency we also need to study the metric
fluctuations.

Our freedom to make coordinate redefinitions allows the metric and field
fluctuations to be studied in a variety of gauges [ 114 , 115 ] .
Whatever choice of gauge (corresponding to a threading and slicing of
space-time) we should recover the unperturbed FLRW line element in the
limit of vanishing perturbations.

There is always enough freedom to write the perturbed metric in terms of
the Arnowitt–Deser–Misner (ADM) metric [ 116 ] ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the lapse, @xmath is the shift function, and @xmath is
the intrinsic metric on spacelike hypersurfaces of constant time @xmath
. The ADM formalism is sometimes called the Hamiltonian formulation of
General Relativity, which was nicely reviewed by D’Eath in Ref. [ 117 ]
. In the absence of perturbations @xmath and @xmath , and Eq. ( 2.5 )
reduces to the background FLRW metric ( 1.2 ), if the spatial metric is
flat, @xmath . The usefulness of this space-time foliation is that
@xmath and @xmath do not support propagating modes, which are restricted
to @xmath and the spatial metric @xmath only. There are three scalar ⁷ ⁷
7 These originate from the field perturbation @xmath , and the scalar
components of @xmath which are proportional to @xmath and @xmath (any
metric can be decomposed into these scalar components, and others). and
two tensor modes, of which one scalar can be gauged away by choice of
spatial coordinates and another by choice of time.

At quadratic order the tensor modes decouple from the scalar
fluctuations. This has a simple consequence: when computing the
quadratic action for the tensor fluctuations, the scalar field
contributions @xmath will not contribute to the answer. At tree-level
the tensor fluctuations only start contributing to the four-point
function [ 93 , 69 ] . The contributions of the tensor modes to the
bispectrum arise only at loop level, generated by insertion of vertices
with extra factors of the fluctuations. Such diagrammatic expansion is
in powers of @xmath , which is negligible compared to the contributions
from tree-level diagrams. In what follows we shall work at tree-level, ⁸
⁸ 8 Weinberg [ 118 , 8 , 119 ] and van der Meulen & Smit [ 120 ] have
investigated when loop diagrams are subdominant compared to tree-level
diagrams. and we therefore discard in what follows the tensor modes. We
will compute in § 3.5 the spectrum of tensor perturbations.

Regardless of whether or not we take the tensor fluctuations into
account, we use constraint equations to find the lapse and the shift as
functions of the propagating modes. This is because @xmath and @xmath
are, in fact, Lagrange multipliers in the action. While @xmath is
associated with the freedom of choosing time reparametrizations, @xmath
is associated with spatial coordinates reparametrizations.
Alternatively, we could adopt the path integral formulation for
inflationary perturbations proposed in [ 121 ] , which does not solve
for these constraint equations; rather the constraints are imposed by
introducing auxiliary, non-dynamical fields. In this thesis, however, we
shall adopt the traditional route and solve for the constraint
equations.

The choice of gauge depends essentially on the model we want to study.
If there are multiple fields in the action then it is common to adopt
the uniform-curvature gauge , whereas in single-field models it is
traditional to work in the comoving gauge . In the latter the
three-dimensional surfaces are chosen so that @xmath is perfectly
homogeneous and there exists only one propagating scalar mode—this is
absorbed by @xmath in the spatially flat metric @xmath , via

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

From this equation we read that @xmath is the perturbation of the
locally defined scale factor, which encodes the expansion history of the
universe [ 42 , 122 ] . Using the definition of the number of e-folds in
Eq. ( 1.29 ), it follows that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

This equation is the essence of the “ @xmath ” or “gradient expansion”
formalism, which is a popular approach for computing the correlation
functions of @xmath , and therefore non-gaussianity—see, for example,
Refs. [ 123 , 57 ] .

Notation .—At this point we comment on the notation for the comoving
curvature perturbation used in this thesis, which agrees with the more
recent literature, including Refs. [ 124 , 66 , 45 , 125 , 11 , 126 ] .
Historically, the perturbation in the comoving gauge was initially
denoted by @xmath —see, for example, the early papers in Refs. [ 127 ,
128 , 48 ] . The letter @xmath had often been reserved to denote the
perturbation in the uniform density gauge. In either case, in
single-field inflation for adiabatic, super-horizon perturbations, the
comoving and uniform density slicings coincide—up to a(n) (irrelevant)
sign convention—as showed by Wands et al. [ 48 ] . It then follows that
for super-horizon evolution (or rather, lack of), we can write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the letters can be interchanged without harm. Throughout this thesis
we employ the notation that @xmath is the comoving curvature
perturbation.

Slow-variation parameters .—Our first goal is to deduce the action for
the small, inhomogeneous perturbations, @xmath . It is in this sense
that we work perturbatively in @xmath . This is independent of assuming
a slow-roll approximation.

As we have discussed in § 1.3 , one typically assumes that inflation is
described by a de Sitter expansion, when the Hubble parameter, @xmath ,
is constant. To quantitatively describe how far away inflation can occur
from a purely de Sitter epoch, one typically introduces slow-roll
parameters, as defined in Eqs. ( 1.28 ) and ( 1.30 ):

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

To parametrize the time evolution of the sound speed for perturbations
we further introduce

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

For inflation to occur we expect background quantities to be slowly
varying, and to satisfy

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This is the slow-roll approximation .

Action and constraints .—Writing the action ( 2.1 ) in terms of the ADM
variables in Eq. ( 2.5 ), we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath satisfies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here @xmath denotes a covariant derivative with respect to @xmath , and
symmetrized indices are enclosed in brackets @xmath . The extrinsic
curvature of spatial slices, @xmath , is related to @xmath via the shift
function, @xmath .

The (non-dynamical) constraint equations are obtained by varying the
action with respect to @xmath and @xmath [ 88 ] . We find

  ----- -------- -- ---------
        @xmath      (2.12a)
  and               
        @xmath      (2.12b)
  ----- -------- -- ---------

Eqs. ( 2.12a )–( 2.12b ) are to be solved order-by-order. To do so, we
write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is some expandable function in powers of the perturbation
@xmath . Likewise, the shift vector can be decomposed into its
irrotational and divergent-free parts,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath satisfies @xmath , by assumption. We also expand @xmath and
@xmath perturbatively in powers of @xmath , writing the terms of @xmath
order as @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . As discussed in Refs. [ 66 , 45 ]
, it turns out we only need to solve the constraints to first-order to
study the three-point correlations. ⁹ ⁹ 9 To be more precise, in general
to obtain the @xmath -point correlator, we only need to solve the
Euler-Lagrange equations to @xmath -order. To first-order, we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have introduced quantities measuring derivatives of @xmath [ 88
] :

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.14a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.14b)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Some of our formulae will be expressed in terms of these variables.

#### 2.2.2 Two-point correlations

To compute the two-point statistics of the comoving curvature
perturbation we first need to obtain the action ( 2.10 ) to second-order
in @xmath . This was first done for @xmath theories by Garriga &
Mukhanov [ 86 ] , who have found

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . The form of this action is actually quite general, and we
will see it applies to all single-field models of interest. To make the
comparison with extensions of this chapter easier, we will leave @xmath
explicit in our formulae. Accordingly, we define the corresponding
slow-variation parameter,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

The last equality applies to @xmath models only. For more complicated
theories, such as galileon inflation, this shall not be the case and
@xmath can have a rather complicated expression. The only requirement we
impose on @xmath is that is must be positive so that the fluctuations
are not ghost-like, and its first-derivative must be well-defined.

To simplify some intermediate expressions, it will be necessary to have
an expression for the variation @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath satisfies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

The equation of motion for @xmath follows by setting @xmath in ( 2.17
)—we say @xmath is on-shell .

Slow-variation approximation .—Although Eqs. ( 2.15 ) and ( 2.17 )–(
2.18 ) are exact at linear order in @xmath , it is not known how to
solve the equation of motion ( 2.17 ) for arbitrary backgrounds in
conformal time variables, when @xmath might be non-perturbative. We will
show how this can be done using different time coordinates in § 5.1 .

As an alternative approach, Lidsey et al. [ 106 ] noted that the
time-derivative of each slow-variation parameter is proportional to a
sum of products of slow-variation parameters, overall contributing at
next-order in slow-roll. Therefore, assuming

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

and working to first-order in these quantities, we may formally treat
them as constants. The calculation will then be organised in increasing
powers of these quantities. Corrections contributing at or higher-order
than next-to-next order will not be kept, since we expect them to be
strongly subdominant. Indeed, in general we expect next-to-next order
terms to be suppressed compared to next-order corrections by the same
amount that next-order terms are corrections to leading-order results.

The expansion of a general background quantity under the slow-variation
approximation above works as follows. Take the Hubble parameter, @xmath
, to be a representative background quantity. Expanding this variable up
to next-order in slow-roll around a reference time, @xmath , yields

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath denotes the number of elapsed e-folds since the reference
time. The reference time is just a pivot scale and we anticipate that
physical quantities (that is, observables ) cannot depend on the
arbitrary reference scale @xmath , or equivalently @xmath . This is
precisely equivalent to what happens in renormalisation techniques in
quantum field theory. We expect Eq. ( 2.20 ) to yield a good
approximation to the full time evolution whenever @xmath [ 104 , 105 ,
129 ] . We see that this approximation fails when @xmath ; also, if some
of the slow-variation parameters become (even) temporarily large around
the time of horizon crossing, as in “feature models” [ 130 , 131 , 132 ,
133 , 134 ] , then this approximation breaks down. It follows that the
approximation ( 2.20 ) can only be trusted a few e-folds after the
reference scale has exited the horizon.

How can we then study the super-horizon evolution of the perturbations
if the approximation ( 2.20 ) does not seem to apply in this asymptotic
limit? The super-horizon limit corresponds to many e-folds after horizon
crossing, when typically one needs to apply an improved formulation of
perturbation theory obtained by resumming powers of @xmath [ 135 , 136 ,
137 ] (various such formalisms are in use [ 57 , 138 , 139 , 140 , 141 ]
). This is usually the case in multi-field inflation, when ordinary
perturbation theory breaks down because of large @xmath and @xmath , and
one needs to invoke some sort of renormalisation technique. In
single-field inflation, however, this difficulty does not arise—this is
because on super-horizon scales, when spatial gradients can safely be
neglected, @xmath is conserved [ 142 , 123 , 143 ] . We expect that the
same conservation theorem applies to the correlation functions of @xmath
. ¹⁰ ¹⁰ 10 We will show that the three-point correlator is
time-independent on super-horizon scales for all the single-field models
studied in this thesis. We will comment on the time-independence of the
two-point correlator shortly.

Two-point function .—The time-ordered two-point function is the Feynman
propagator,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which depends on the 3-dimensional invariant @xmath . Moving to Fourier
space variables @xmath , we can write

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

The @xmath -distribution enforces conservation of three-momentum, and
therefore @xmath . Breaking up the propagator into elementary
wavefunctions of the primordial perturbation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

The elementary wavefunction @xmath is a positive frequency solution of (
2.15 ) with the on-shell requirement @xmath . Working to next-order in
the slow-variation approximation ( 2.19 ), we find the time evolution
for the perturbation modes

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.23)
  -- -- -- --------

with @xmath being the Hankel function of the second kind of order @xmath
, and @xmath . At sufficiently early times when the modes are well
within the horizon, @xmath , they cannot feel the curvature of
space-time, and Eq. ( 2.23 ) describes the time evolution of the
perturbations in Minkowski space [ 144 ] .

Power spectrum .—The two-point function at equal times defines the power
spectrum @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

In general, the power spectrum evolves in time, and one needs to specify
the time at which it is to be evaluated. Using Eq. ( 2.22 ) for @xmath ,
working in the super-horizon limit @xmath and expanding all the
background quantities uniformly around a reference time @xmath , we can
safely neglect the decaying mode and approximate the time evolution of
the perturbations by the growing mode. We find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Euler–Mascheroni constant is @xmath . We have introduced a quantity
@xmath satisfying @xmath . Since to leading-order in slow-roll, @xmath ,
we describe @xmath as the horizon-crossing time associated with the
wavenumber @xmath . ¹² ¹² 12 Chen et al. [ 45 ] adopted a definition in
terms of @xmath , but the content of their results is identical to ours.
The leading-order result in slow-roll is the first coefficient in
between the square bracket @xmath , and the “next-order” correction
arises from the remaining terms which are one higher-order in the
slow-roll expansion. Eq. ( 2.25 ) therefore satisfies the organisational
scheme of the slow-roll approximation used throughout this thesis.

The formula for the power spectrum ( 2.25 ) allows for a clear statement
of the time-independence of the two-point correlator. We note that our
calculation started with an expansion of all the background quantities
around some reference time @xmath , or equivalently, some reference
scale @xmath . Nevertheless, Eq. ( 2.25 ) does not depend on @xmath and
therefore becomes time-independent once the scale @xmath has crossed
outside the sound-horizon. This is a special property of single-field
inflation. In classical perturbation theory @xmath becomes constant and
it appears that, in all the examples in the literature, the correlation
functions are explicitly time-independent as well. We will return to
this issue in § 2.3.1 when we discuss the three-point correlator in
detail.

Scale-dependence .—We have observed that the power spectrum ( 2.25 ) is
time-independent on super-horizon scales. Moreover it exhibits a weak
scale-dependence through the logarithmic term in @xmath . We conclude
that the quantitative predictive power of ( 2.25 ) is limited for scales
obeying @xmath . Because @xmath is an arbitrary scale, we always have
the freedom to choose @xmath . To compute the scaling of the power
spectrum, one introduces its “dimensionless” version @xmath by the rule
@xmath . We define the spectral index (assuming @xmath ) as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is valid to lowest-order in slow-roll [ 102 ] . We see that by
fixing the scale, one can no longer work with constant background
quantities, and their time-dependence needs to be taken into account.
Alternatively, one could have left the scale-dependence arbitrary, and
extracted the coefficients multiplying @xmath directly. The spectral
index is therefore the logarithmic scale-dependence of the power
spectrum. Given the alternative ways of computing the spectral index
under the slow-roll approximation, it follows that Eq. ( 2.26 ) can be
interpreted as a renormalisation group equation in quantum field theory
describing the flow of @xmath with @xmath , where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

plays the rôle of the @xmath -function.

The computation of correlation functions of @xmath is indeed strongly
related to renormalisation group techniques popular in quantum field
theory. The comoving curvature perturbation is related to the field
fluctuation via the one-to-one mapping

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It thus follows that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have defined @xmath . Considering a canonically normalized
scalar field and using the scalar field equations of motion under the
slow-roll approximation, we can write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the second term in brackets captures the next-order corrections.
Replacing Eq. ( 2.25 ) in Eq. ( 2.27 ), we find that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

Applying the Callan–Symanzik equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath , we find that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have used @xmath . We conclude that using renormalisation
groups techniques applied to slow-roll inflation can be used to
understand how the correlators run with scale. Furthermore, a
generalisation to multi-field inflation can prove useful in
understanding the time and scale-dependences of the correlators. We do
not attempt this here.

To complete the presentation of the slow-variation catalogue, we define
additional slow-variation parameters to control the expansion,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

Table 2.1 collects the results for the spectral index valid at leading
and next-order for different single-field theories. As argued above, in
multi-field models the spectral index will have a super-horizon
evolution, and will therefore depend on time—see, for example, Ref. [
145 ] .

### 2.3 Three-point correlations

To compute non-gaussianities, we need the cubic action for @xmath . For
the action ( 2.1 ) this calculation was first done by Seery & Lidsey in
Ref. [ 88 ] , where a partial result for the three-point function was
obtained. The full three-point function was later obtained by Chen et
al. [ 45 ] .

#### 2.3.1 Third-order action

We briefly describe the algorithm for computing the cubic action of
@xmath here. After expanding the action perturbatively in @xmath to
third-order, applying numerous integration by parts, using Eqs. ( 2.3 )
and ( 2.13 ), we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

We recall that @xmath and @xmath were defined in Eqs. ( 2.14a ) and (
2.14b ). In addition we find the boundary contribution to the action:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

The action given by the combination of Eqs. ( 2.32 ) and ( 2.33 ) can be
further simplified by performing integration by parts. Combining Eqs. (
2.13 ) and ( 2.17 ) with Eq. ( 2.18 ), one finds

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.34)
  -- -- -- --------

to which we should add the contributions from the boundary terms as
follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

In Eq. ( 2.34 ) we have defined @xmath to satisfy

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

On-shell, we observe that the cubic action for perturbations ( 2.34 ) is
given by five Lagrangian operators only. This seems to differ in
appearance from the actions obtained in Refs. [ 88 , 45 ] . There, a
further transformation was made to rewrite the terms proportional to the
slow-variation parameter @xmath . Using the field equation ( 2.17 ) and
integrating by parts, this procedure gives rise to new contributions
both to @xmath and to the boundary term. Moreover, it also generates one
extra operator @xmath , which does not appear in Eq. ( 2.34 ).

In this thesis we will work with the action ( 2.34 ) for the following
reasons. First, as we shall shortly see, to compute the full three-point
correlation function, we require the contributions arising from each
Lagrangian operator separately. Therefore the more operators in the
cubic action, the more individual contributions one needs to compute.
Second, after making the additional transformation, the boundary terms
will now contribute to the three-point function. To consolidate their
contribution one now requires an appropriate field redefinition, that
generates an auxiliary field @xmath . This redefinition must eventually
be reversed to obtain the correlation functions of the physical field
@xmath . As we explain below, leaving the action in the form of ( 2.34 )
renders such field redefinition unnecessary.

Boundary terms .—The boundary terms defined in a three-dimensional
hypersurface in Eqs. ( 2.33 ) and ( 2.35 ) arise in the cubic action
from integration by parts with respect to time. They were not quoted in
the original calculation by Maldacena [ 66 ] , neither in subsequent
calculations by Seery & Lidsey [ 88 ] , and Chen et al. [ 45 ] . These
calculations explicitly discarded all boundary terms, retaining only
contributions proportional to @xmath in the action ( 2.34 ). The @xmath
terms were then subtracted by making a field redefinition.

This procedure can be misleading. The terms proportional to @xmath give
no contribution to any Feynman diagram at any order in perturbation
theory, because @xmath is zero by construction when evaluated on a
propagator—this is the on-shell evaluation we mentioned before. The
final answer should therefore be the same whether these terms are
subtracted or not. On the other hand, if a field redefinition is
performed, then we expect the correlator to be modified accordingly.

Under what conditions is this subtraction procedure correct then? It
will yield the correct answer if and only if it reproduces the
contribution of the boundary component in ( 2.35 ). This argument was
first given in Ref. [ 67 ] , and later in more detail in Refs. [ 146 ,
137 ] , but it was applied to the third-order action for field
fluctuations in the spatially flat gauge. In this gauge only a few
integrations by parts are required. The boundary term is not complicated
and the subtraction procedure works as intended. In the present case,
however, it appears impossible that the subtraction procedure could be
correct, because the boundary action ( 2.35 ) contains operators such as
@xmath which are not present in @xmath . Indeed, because @xmath becomes
constant at late times, the @xmath term seems to diverge which should
manifest itself as a rapidly evolving contribution to the three-point
function outside the horizon. As we pointed out earlier, this is
forbidden in single-field inflation.

This potential problem can be seen most clearly after making the
redefinition @xmath under which the quadratic action transforms as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

The bulk term proportional to @xmath disappears by construction. After
the transformation above, the boundary term becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

in which @xmath is to be interpreted as a function of @xmath [cf. Eq. (
2.18 )].

The subtraction procedure has produced Eq. ( 2.38 ) which is not zero.
This result only leaves the conclusions of Refs. [ 66 , 88 , 45 ]
unchanged if Eq. ( 2.38 ) does not contribute to the three-point
correlator. We will see that this is guaranteed by conservation of
@xmath on super-horizon scales. Before doing so, we need to briefly
recapitulate the in-in formalism necessary to compute the correlation
functions. We will then return to the issue of the contributions to the
three-point function from the boundary terms in § 2.3.3 .

#### 2.3.2 Schwinger–Keldysh’s in-in formalism

The correlation functions we want to study are equal-time expectation
values taken in the state corresponding to the vacuum at past infinity.
They are different from the “in-out” calculations performed in particle
physics which determine the probability of some in state (defined at
past infinity) becoming an out state at future infinity. Quantum field
theory correlation functions were initially studied by Schwinger [ 147 ]
and Keldysh [ 148 ] in the 60s, and later applied to cosmology by Jordan
[ 149 ] and Calzetta & Hu [ 150 ] . But it was only with Maldacena’s
epic publication in 2002 [ 66 ] that the applications of the in-in
formalism to non-gaussianity were made more clear, together with a pair
of papers by Weinberg [ 8 , 119 ] . This formalism is the appropriate
construction to compute expectation values on a time-dependent
background, and we briefly summarise its basic ideas in what follows
(there are a number of papers which review the in-in formalism—see, for
example, Refs. [ 68 , 151 , 152 ] ).

We will be interested in computing three-point correlation functions at
tree-level in the interactions of @xmath .

{figwindow}

[0,1, [] , Integration contour for the Feynman path integral.] In terms
of the Argand diagram in complex conformal time @xmath , these
correlations are obtained by performing a path integral from the true
vacuum of the theory, at @xmath , to the time of interest when we
compute the expectation value, @xmath . To this we add the path integral
performed backwards, which returns to the vacuum at @xmath .

Schematically, this can be translated into the functional integral

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the forward path integral is labelled by the fields @xmath ,
whereas the backwards path integral is labelled by the fields @xmath .
This is Schwinger’s formula . In practice, to project onto the true
vacuum of the interacting theory, one needs to translate the integration
contour to be slightly above and below the negative real axis of
conformal time—this is shown in figure 2.2. This prescription is in many
ways similar to the @xmath trick recurrent in quantum field theory and
ensures the convergence of the integral above. The fields @xmath and
@xmath are constrained (by the @xmath -distribution) to agree at any one
time later than that of the observation, so that the path integrals are
evaluated with an integration contour necessarily turning and crossing
the (negative) real @xmath -axis.

The correlation function can be interpreted in terms of Feynman
diagrams: at tree-level and to leading order in the interactions, the
three-point correlator is the sum of two Feynman diagrams, depicted in
figure 2.3, corresponding to the two integrations in Eq. ( 2.39 ).

Each diagram has three legs with momentum labels @xmath , and at the
“core” the vertices are evaluated using either the labels @xmath or
@xmath . The external legs are to be evaluated at a later time, whereas
the internal lines are associated to earlier times. Each diagram will
give a contribution which is precisely the complex conjugate of the
other—this means we only need to compute one of these diagrams for each
operator in Eq. ( 2.34 ). In total, there will be five such calculations
to produce the overall bispectrum.

So how are the elementary wavefunctions used to construct the
bispectrum? To answer this let us first look at an explicit calculation
of a three-point correlator following Schwinger’s formula ( 2.39 ).
Focusing on one Feynman diagram and losing the field label to simplify
the notation, we write

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

Expanding the cubic action of @xmath in the interactions, and moving to
Fourier space, we get

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.40)
                          
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath represent higher-order, slow-roll suppressed contributions,
and @xmath denotes one of the five cubic operators, which contain at
least one (time or spatial) differentiated field. For the purposes of
illustrating how the calculation of the three-point correlator works
though, it suffices to consider @xmath an arbitrary cubic operator in
@xmath .

The first term in curly brackets offers no contribution to the
three-point function because it involves an odd number of fields @xmath
weighted by a Gaussian measure @xmath , which give unsuccessful Wick
contractions. Performing the integration in the spatial coordinates
@xmath , we are left with

  -- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath            (2.41)
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --------

where the @xmath -distribution enforces the conservation of @xmath
-momentum.

At this point we invoke a standard, useful result in quantum field
theory. Let @xmath be a @xmath symmetric, positive-definite matrix. Then

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

It follows that for an expectation value, say the two-point correlator

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the inverse satisfies @xmath . Now, for a free field theory

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath satisfies @xmath , in which @xmath is the mass of the field
@xmath . @xmath is the inverse of the propagator, and the Green’s
function of the operator @xmath . We learn that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

An integration involving one pair of fields gives rise to a propagator,
which is built from the elementary wavefunctions as defined in Eq. (
2.22 ). For each three-point correlator we will require three pairs of
two wavefunctions, each defined at a different time, and the result is

  -- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath            (2.43)
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --------

Our calculation will be a direct application of this formula.

#### 2.3.3 Boundary terms removed

The boundary terms in Eq. ( 2.38 ) were generated from performing
integration by parts, using the equations of motion and the field
redefinition described in Eq. ( 2.37 ). They appear in Eq. ( 2.39 ) as
part of the action @xmath with support at past infinity and at @xmath .
The deformed contour of integration makes any contribution from past
infinity highly suppressed, leaving a boundary term evaluated precisely
at @xmath . Because the @xmath -distribution in Eq. ( 2.39 ) constrains
the fields to agree, it follows that any boundary Lagrangian operators
not involving time derivatives produce only a phase which cancels
between the @xmath and @xmath contours. This implies that operators
involving an admixture of fields and spatial-derivatives of fields give
no contribution either. We conclude that, in principle, only
time-differentiated operators can contribute to the three-point
function.

Revisiting the definition of @xmath in Eq. ( 2.18 ), we understand that
the entire first line of operators in ( 2.38 ) does not contribute to
the answer we are seeking. The argument we have given before that the
fields @xmath and @xmath are constrained to agree at @xmath (enforced by
the @xmath -distribution), does not apply to their time-derivatives. We
therefore focus on the last three operators of the boundary action (
2.38 ).

Inspection of Eq. ( 2.38 ) shows that the time-derivative operators are
of the schematic form @xmath , and therefore lead to a field
redefinition of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This generates operators which have two time-derivatives. We now argue
that boundary operators with two or more time-derivatives are irrelevant
on super-horizon scales. Using the schematic field redefinition, the
three-point correlation functions of @xmath and @xmath are related by
@xmath plus higher-order contributions. However, because Eq. ( 2.25 )
implies that the two-point correlator is time-independent on
super-horizon scales, then @xmath and therefore we can write @xmath , up
to an irrelevant decaying mode.

Therefore, on super-horizon scales, the correlation functions of the
original and redefined fields agree, and after subtraction by a field
redefinition, the unwanted boundary terms in Eq. ( 2.38 ) can be
ignored. We can also see that the contributions given by
time-differentiated operators of order two or higher are zero because of
conservation of @xmath . We conclude that time-differentiated operators
can be discarded from the three-point functions calculations.

We observe that the only problematic field redefinitions are of the
schematic form @xmath , which arise from boundary operators containing a
single time-derivative. Eq. ( 2.38 ) contains no such operators, and
therefore we can discard all the boundary action in what follows. We
note, however, that this was not guaranteed to be the case, and that a
careful analysis of the boundary terms must, in general, be performed.
Shortly before Ref. [ 1 ] was submitted for publication, a preprint by
Arroja & Tanaka appeared [ 153 ] presenting arguments regarding the rôle
of boundary terms which are equivalent to those of this section.

### 2.4 Beyond @xmath and towards Horndeski theories

We conclude that the relevant operators in our calculation of the
three-point function in @xmath theories are

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.44)
  -- -- -- --------

The interaction coefficients @xmath can be read from Eq. ( 2.34 ).

The calculation we have described above follows the traditional
methodology to compute the bispectrum in a given inflationary theory:
starting from the action for the background field @xmath we have applied
perturbation theory to derive the action for the perturbation @xmath .

However, recent developments have simplified this procedure. First, Gao
& Steer [ 84 ] and De Felice & Tsujikawa [ 154 ] (see also Ref. [ 155 ]
) obtained the universal action for perturbations in stable single-field
models involving what we call Horndeski operators [ 156 ] (cubic
operators in @xmath ). Over thirty years ago, Horndeski had already
written the most general action involving one single scalar field
yielding equations of motion which were at most second-order in
derivatives [ 157 ] . This action has the following structure

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.45)
  -- -- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.46a)
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.46b)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

in which @xmath are arbitrary functions of @xmath and @xmath , @xmath
and @xmath is the Einstein tensor. Although the action involves
high-order derivatives, the non-minimal couplings to the curvature
ensure that the resulting Euler-Lagrange equations for @xmath are at
most second-order in derivatives. This is an essential requirement for
the theory to respect unitarity. Recently there has been renewed
interest in these theories in the context of DGP theories [ 79 ] , and
gravity theories based on galileon models (see, for example, Refs. [ 158
, 85 , 159 , 160 ] ; see also Ref. [ 161 ] ).

Unless an additional symmetry is imposed on these theories (for example,
through the specific form of the functions @xmath ), they will not be
stable against radiative corrections. Among higher-derivative theories,
a notable exception is DBI inflation [ 27 ] , where a higher dimensional
boost protects the coefficients in the function @xmath from receiving
large radiative corrections. If we, however, relax this requirement, we
conclude that any healthy, single-field inflation model can be written
in the form ( 2.45 ). The only model dependent features in the action
would reside in different coefficients chosen in the functions @xmath .

Second, it was shown in Ref. [ 155 ] that the cubic action for @xmath
has a minimal representation in terms of only five of these Horndeski
operators. This action was originally derived in Ref. [ 1 ] , on which
this chapter is based. It is our Eq. ( 2.44 ).

With these latest developments we arrive at a universal methodology to
compute the bispectrum of all single-field models, with the cubic action
for @xmath being always of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

The model-dependent imprints will be encoded in each of the five
coefficients @xmath of the Horndeski operators. There is a priori no
hierarchy between these coefficients, although specialization to
different models can impose specific ratios between @xmath (as in DBI
inflation). The action above will be our starting point in computing the
bispectrum for all single-field models, whether or not the slow-roll
approximation is invoked. This is because the action ( 2.47 ) is
perturbative in @xmath , but exact in slow-roll.

## Chapter 3 Microphysics in Non-Gaussianity

In the previous chapter we revisited the computation of the two-point
correlator and briefly reviewed the “in-in” formalism for correlation
functions. We have initiated the calculation of the bispectrum of
single-field inflation theories and have argued that the cubic action
for perturbations is simplest written in terms of five bulk operators,
given in Eq. ( 2.47 ). The calculation we are about to describe applies
to any single-field inflation model where the equations of motion are at
most second-order in derivatives of the field. For the purposes of
understanding the implications of our results, however, we will specify
the coefficients @xmath to certain models of interest.

Outline .—In this chapter we report a calculation of the next-order
corrections to the bispectrum. We break up the next-order bispectrum in
its magnitude, @xmath , and its shape and scale-dependences. In this
chapter we shall focus on its magnitude, whereas §§ 4.1 – 4.2 of chapter
4 will be devoted to the scale and shape-dependences of the bispectrum.

Applications of our results to a collection of models are displayed in
§§ 3.3 – 3.4 . § 3.3 focuses on canonical single-field inflation models
with an arbitrary potential, whilst § 3.4 explores models which can
imprint a significant non-gaussian signature because of their
non-canonical structure—of these we focus on DBI inflation and @xmath
-inflation. In § 3.4.1 we discuss an important consequence of obtaining
next-order corrections for @xmath in generalised DBI inflation model.
Through such corrections we gain access to compactification data, such
as the shape of the potential and the warp factor, for the first time.
Not only does this calculation decrease the theory error associated with
previous estimates of the bispectrum, but it also allows access to
important information encoded in the CMB which can reveal data
inaccessible by other means.

In § 3.5 we turn to the set of observables related to tensor
fluctuations. Primordial gravitational waves are a generic prediction of
inflationary models. We briefly review the next-order computation of the
power spectrum for tensor fluctuations: we compute the tensor-to-scalar
ratio, @xmath , and the scaling of the tensor perturbations through the
tensor spectral index, @xmath .

Finally, we summarise our findings in § 3.6 . Appendix A supports the
findings of this chapter. In A.1 we give details of the derivation of
the next-order corrections to the scalar propagator. We collect in
Appendices A.2 – A.3 mathematical details of certain integrals needed
for presenting the next-order bispectrum in closed form. This appendix
extends what had been originally obtained by Chen et al. in Ref. [ 45 ]
.

This chapter is based on work done in collaboration with Clare Burrage
and David Seery, published in Ref. [ 1 ] .

### 3.1 The bispectrum beyond lowest-order

We define the bispectrum, @xmath , in terms of the three-point function
¹ ¹ 1 This definition may differ from other notations in the literature,
such as that in Ref. [ 45 ] , by numerical factors of @xmath .

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

It turns out to be useful to define the reduced bispectrum , @xmath ,
which satisfies [ 51 , 57 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Observational constraints are typically quoted in terms of @xmath
evaluated in certain bispectrum templates often used in CMB analysis to
compare the measured bispectrum with the bispectrum predicted by the
theory. We discuss them in § 4.2.1 . Each template can be thought of as
being related to a specific triangular configuration, although this need
not be the case. Current constraints on @xmath in the simplest
inflationary models have been discussed by Senatore et al. in Ref. [ 162
] . Tighter constraints are expected to be placed in the upcoming year
using Planck ’s data.

#### 3.1.1 Sources of next-order corrections

We are now in a position to compute the three-point function of Eq. (
2.34 ) to next-order in the slow-roll approximation. As we discussed in
§ 2.3.3 , the boundary action and @xmath contributions can be discarded
by construction of the in-in formalism and because the propagators are
evaluated on-shell.

Next-order terms arise in the bulk operators from a variety of sources.
First, the coefficients of each interaction vertex in Eq. ( 2.34 )
contain an admixture of leading and next-order contributions in the
slow-roll approximation. This allowed us to anticipate an estimate of
the next-order contributions to three-point correlator in § 2.1.2 .
Second, the leading-order part of each vertex is a (slowly)
time-dependent quantity which must be expanded around a reference time
or scale, as in Eq. ( 2.20 ), producing next-order terms. Third, there
are next-order corrections to the propagator, obtained by expanding Eqs.
( 2.22 )–( 2.23 ) around the reference time. Propagator corrections
appear on both the external and internal legs of the diagram. The
external legs corrections correspond to the propagator arising at late
times, when we take @xmath ; the internal legs corrections arise from
the expansion of the order of the Hankel functions in Eq ( 2.23 ).

It may be useful to identify these corrections in the Feynman diagram as
follows

#### 3.1.2 Reference time, factorisation scale

To proceed, we must choose a reference point @xmath around which to
expand time-dependent quantities. Such reference point is arbitrary by
construction, but some choices might be more useful than others. Take an
arbitrary correlation function of fields @xmath (not necessarily a
three-point correlator). Whatever our choice of @xmath , the result (
2.25 ) for the power spectrum shows that we must expect logarithms of
the form @xmath which compensate for the difference in time of horizon
crossing between the mode @xmath and the reference scale @xmath . To
obtain a reliable answer we should attempt to minimise these logarithms.

What typical values do the logarithmic terms have? Consider an arbitrary
three or higher order correlator. If all fields participating in the
correlation function carry momenta of approximately common magnitude
@xmath —described as the “equilateral limit”—the logarithm will be small
when @xmath . The logarithmic term will, in general, be less or of order
unity, and it will multiply a slow-variation parameter, or a linear
combination of these. In this case, naïve perturbation theory is not
spoiled by the appearance of large logarithms.

In the opposite limit, one or more fields have “soft” momenta of order
@xmath which are much smaller than the remaining “hard” momenta of order
@xmath , @xmath . When @xmath it will not be possible to find a choice
of @xmath which keeps all logarithms small; while we might be able to
minimise one of these, say @xmath , the hierarchy between @xmath and
@xmath modes makes @xmath inevitably very large. Said differently, a
reference scale appropriate for small scale physics will produce
sizeable corrections to large scale physics and the calculation passes
outside the validity of ordinary perturbation theory. At this point one
requires a resummation technique to deal with large logarithmic terms.
We have encountered the problem of large logarithms which led to the
renormalisation group formalism of Gell-Mann & Low [ 163 ] .

In the study of inflationary correlation functions, configurations
mixing hard and soft momenta with @xmath are referred to as “squeezed.”
For this configuration of momenta, the bispectrum for canonical
inflation reaches its maximum magnitude [ 66 ] . Given the analogy with
ordinary processes in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) [ 164 ] , one could
study the behaviour of a correlation function as its momenta are
squeezed by setting up an appropriate renormalisation group analysis [
165 ] . But this is more complicated than necessary.

Maldacena argued that, as the momentum carried by one operator becomes
soft, the three-point function factorises into the two-point correlation
between the remaining hard operators on a background created by the soft
operator [ 66 ] . Because of the @xmath -distribution in the bispectrum
( 3.1 ), the two hard operators are described by the same energy scale.
@xmath arises naturally as the appropriate observable quantity since the
bispectrum factorises into two copies of the power spectrum multiplied
by @xmath (as we shall see in § 3.2.2 ). Factorization of this kind is
typical in the infrared dynamics of gauge theories such as QCD, where it
plays an important rôle in extracting observational predictions. The
various factorisation theorems for QCD correlation functions have been
comprehensively reviewed by Collins, Soper & Sterman [ 166 ] .

The concept of factorisation is not new in cosmology. Indeed, the
separate universe method can be thought of as a factorisation theorem
for time-dependent logarithms @xmath . The @xmath rules which translate
correlation functions of the field perturbations, @xmath , into
correlation functions of @xmath are an important special case, and they
allow for the summation of large logarithms. In this sense,
factorisation is as important in extracting observable quantities for
inflation as it is for QCD. Maldacena’s argument was later generalised
by Creminelli & Zaldarriaga [ 167 ] . The factorisation property can be
illustrated by an explicit decomposition of the field into hard and soft
modes—see Refs. [ 168 , 169 ] .

Because the squeezed limit can be described by Maldacena’s technique,
the outcome of this discussion is that the reference scale should
usually be chosen to minimise the logarithms when all momenta are
comparable. In the remainder of this chapter we quote results for
arbitrary @xmath for full generality, but frequently adopt the symmetric
choice @xmath when citing numerical results. ² ² 2 In the gauge theory
language discussed above, the scale @xmath can be thought of as the
factorisation scale. Operators carrying momentum @xmath should not be
included as part of the hard subprocess, but factorised into the
background. Having done so, we will be formally unable to describe the
squeezed limit. Nevertheless, we will be able to verify the correctness
of our calculation at the onset of factorisation in appropriate
circumstances—a property usually referred to as Maldacena’s consistency
relation . ³ ³ 3 See Renaux-Petel [ 169 ] for a recent discussion of
Maldacena’s condition applied to @xmath models.

#### 3.1.3 Horndeski operators

In chapter 2 we obtained the cubic action ( 2.44 ) for the comoving
curvature perturbation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

In a @xmath model the interaction vertices are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath                              (3.4)
              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

but our calculation will apply for arbitrary coefficients @xmath .
Therefore, unless explicitly written otherwise, the results that follow
hold for any Horndeski theory.

Although @xmath is dimensionless by construction, it is helpful to think
about it as a field of engineering dimension @xmath , obtained after
division by the Hubble rate @xmath . In this counting scheme, the @xmath
operator is dimension-6, whereas the remaining four operators are
dimension-5. At low energies one would naïvely expect the dimension-6
operator to be irrelevant in comparison to those of dimension-5.
Nevertheless, the dimension-5 operators are suppressed by the scale
@xmath making all contributions equally relevant in the action ( 3.3 ).
This manifests itself as an extra power of @xmath in the denominator of
@xmath , which will appear in our results. Estimates of the magnitude of
next-order corrections described in § 2.1.2 are based on the
interactions ( 3.4 )—we will discuss this in more detail in § 3.4 .

As we discussed in § 3.1.1 , the vertex factors @xmath are
time-dependent background quantities. We can therefore introduce
slow-variation parameters @xmath which measure their rate of change per
e-fold,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

we take these to be @xmath in the slow-variation approximation, that is,
@xmath .

### 3.2 Three-point correlations

We use these conventions to compute the bispectra at next-order in
slow-roll for each operator in the action ( 3.3 ). The resulting
three-point functions are intricate objects of momenta, and when quoting
their magnitudes it is often helpful to adopt an organizing principle.
We divide the possible contributions into two natural classes. In the
first class, labelled ‘ @xmath ,’ we collect

1.  the leading-order bispectrum,

2.  effects arising from corrections to the wavefunctions associated
    with external lines, and

3.  effects arising from the time variation of the vertices.

In the second class, labelled ‘ @xmath ,’ we focus on internal legs
corrections to the Feynman diagrams. These classes are qualitatively
different in character because wavefunctions associated with the
internal lines are integrated over time.

Large logarithms, infrared singularities .—In our answers, we expect at
least three species of large logarithms to appear, disrupting ordinary
perturbation theory. We carefully track the contribution from each
species. The most familiar types, already encountered in the two-point
function, measure time- and scale-dependences. A third type of large
logarithm is associated with the far infrared limit @xmath discussed in
§ 3.1 —this is Maldacena’s “squeezed” limit, in which the behaviour of
the three-point function obeys a factorisation principle. We will show
that the various large logarithms arrange themselves in such a way that
they can be absorbed into the scale-dependence of background quantities.

Time-dependent logarithms appear after expanding background quantities
near a fixed reference scale, as in Eq. ( 2.20 ), where at conformal
time @xmath the number of elapsed e-folds counts @xmath . In § 2.2.2 we
explained that the correlation functions of @xmath are expected to
become time-independent far outside the horizon. Therefore there cannot
be any time-dependence in our final result.

How do the @xmath terms disappear from the answer? Some @xmath -type
logarithms cancel amongst themselves, but others cancel with
time-dependent logarithms arising from wavefunction corrections
associated with internal lines. The internal lines ⁴ ⁴ 4 This is
explained in detail in § A.1 . are only aware of the intrinsic
geometrical scale @xmath and cannot depend on the arbitrary reference
scale @xmath —this results in a residue of the form @xmath . These are
scaling logarithms describing variation of the three-point function with
the geometrical scale @xmath . They appeared before in the power
spectrum ( 2.25 ), and they are easily distinguishable from other
species of logarithms for they contain @xmath . Scale logarithms can
also occur in the form @xmath .

The third logarithm species takes the form @xmath and first emerges in
the three-point function; this is related to the hierarchy of momentum
scales we discussed in § 3.1.2 . Each side of the triangle must scale
linearly with the perimeter, so despite appearances these have no
dependence on @xmath —they are unaffected by rigid rescalings of the
momentum triangle. To better understand this, one can write @xmath in
terms of the perimeter, @xmath , and two additional coordinates,
describing the angular dependence. This implies that @xmath is
effectively only a function of the angular coordinates, and it is
therefore responsible for the shape-dependence of the bispectrum. The
‘pure’ shape logarithms become large in the squeezed limit @xmath .

We will discuss the appearance of these logarithmic species in detail
next.

#### 3.2.1 The bispectra

@xmath -type bispectrum .—Collecting the @xmath -type contributions to
the bispectrum, we find it can be written as follows

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

The coefficients @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
and @xmath are functions of all three momenta @xmath and are symmetric
under the exchange @xmath . We adopt the convention, used through the
remainder of this thesis, of writing only the asymmetric momentum
explicitly. The notation ‘cyclic permutations’ denotes addition of the
preceding term under cyclic permutations of the @xmath , that is, @xmath
. The result is symmetric under interchange of any two momenta by
construction.

We give explicit expressions for the coefficient of these functions in
Table 3.1 . The quantity @xmath is a linear combination of
slow-variation parameters, @xmath , and it has also appeared in the
power spectrum ( 2.25 ). The term in @xmath includes the entire
leading-order bispectrum.

@xmath -type bispectrum .—The @xmath -type bispectrum must be added to
the @xmath -type terms. It contributes at next-order only and can be
written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

The same convention applies to the arguments of the coefficient
functions @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
; explicit expressions are provided in Table 3.2 . As before, ‘cyclic
permutations’ entails addition of the preceding term under cyclic
permutations of the @xmath .

We observe that the type- @xmath bispectrum ( 3.7 ) depends on three
logarithmic functions @xmath (which are not Bessel functions) defined by

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.8a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.8b)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.8c)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . These exhaust the ‘pure’ shape logarithms of the form
@xmath , discussed above. It transpires from Eqs. ( 3.8 ) that there is
an obvious logarithmic divergence in the squeezed limit @xmath , which
we will show to be responsible for factorisation of the correlation
function. There is potentially a power-law divergence in the limit
@xmath . This is also a squeezed limit, in which the @xmath side stays
fixed while @xmath . In this limit @xmath , making the @xmath naïvely
divergent. If present, such power-law divergences would be puzzling.
However, it can be checked that, in combination with the logarithm, each
@xmath is finite. This infrared-safe behaviour relies on a resummation
procedure reached by analytic continuation—see Appendix A.2 for more
details.

The function @xmath in Eq. ( 3.7 ) satisfies

  -- -- -- -------
           (3.9)
  -- -- -- -------

This function is discussed in Appendix A.3 . The coefficients @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath , and @xmath , @xmath , @xmath depend on the operator
under consideration, and they are quoted in Table 3.3 .

Comments on the calculation .—The operators @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
are all dimension-5, and differ only in the arrangement of spatial
gradients. For arbitrary shapes their three-point functions will not
coincide, but for equilateral triangles the arrangement of gradients is
irrelevant and the resulting @xmath should agree. This can be confirmed
upon inspection of the respective coefficients quoted in tables 3.1 ,
3.2 , and 3.3 . This represents a minimal check of our expressions. We
will carry out further checks in §§ 3.3 – 3.4 and § 4.1 using
Maldacena’s consistency condition.

Bispectra @xmath and @xmath are computed using the same in-in formalism
rules briefly reviewed in § 2.3.2 . The third Horndeski operator, @xmath
, presents an additional degree of complexity compared to the others. ⁵
⁵ 5 This difficulty will also appear in chapter 5 . We briefly mention
the technicalities of this calculation here.

Starting from action ( 3.3 ), we note this operator is undifferentiated,
making the integral, at least, power-law divergent. This is because
there will be insufficient powers of conformal time @xmath , to
counteract those in denominator from @xmath in the integrand. As a
result the integrand behaves, at leading-order, as @xmath . At the same
time, next-order corrections will add logarithmic terms to the
integrand. This has serious repercussions in the final result because it
can potentially lead to spurious power-law and logarithmic divergences
in @xmath when one takes the limit @xmath —these are dangerous
interactions , as named by Weinberg [ 8 ] .

In order to ensure that the real part of the correlation function
converges in the asymptotic limit, one needs to carefully isolate the
primitively divergent contributions: either power-laws like @xmath ,
with @xmath , or logarithmic terms @xmath . This is done by integrating
all divergent integrals by parts an appropriate number of times. Only
two situations occur as a result:

1.  the isolated divergent terms contribute with a purely imaginary part
    to the correlation function. In this case, this divergence becomes
    irrelevant since the total correlation function is given by the sum
    of two path integrals which are complex conjugates;

2.  the isolated divergent contributions are real and contribute to the
    final answer. When we sum type @xmath and type @xmath bispectra,
    however, we verify that these divergent contributions precisely
    cancel out amongst themselves and the final result is finite.

It is crucial to take these two possibilities into account to obtain a
correct result: first, to ensure that the correlation functions do not
diverge in their asymptotic limit (at late times); and second, to
guarantee that the calculation contains all the necessary convergent
contributions to the overall bispectrum. This is particularly important
when checking whether our results are consistent with Maldacena’s
factorisation theorem [ 66 , 167 ] .

Next-order corrections .—A subset of next-order corrections to the
bispectrum were calculated by Chen et al. [ 45 ] . Our calculations are
different in two aspects. First, Chen et al. worked to fixed order in
slow-roll quantities, keeping terms of @xmath only. In a model where
@xmath they reproduce the next-order corrections. However, in a model
where @xmath the leading terms are themselves @xmath and the formulae of
Chen et al. reduce to these leading contributions. In our calculation,
we work uniformly to next-order rather than at fixed order in powers of
@xmath . When @xmath our next-order corrections are @xmath , and we have
verified that they agree with those computed in Ref. [ 45 ] . When
@xmath the next-order corrections are @xmath . These were not included
in the formulae quoted in Ref. [ 45 ] .

Second, we retain a floating reference scale @xmath , chosen to be
@xmath in Ref. [ 45 ] . Retaining this scale allows us to extract the
scale- and shape-dependences of @xmath —see §§ 4.1 – 4.2 .

#### 3.2.2 Formulae for @xmath

The individual bispectra, with their detailed shape-dependence, are the
principal observable objects containing a wealth of information about
the microphysics during inflation. However, for simple model comparisons
it is helpful and quite popular to have an explicit expression for the
nonlinearity parameter @xmath defined in Eq. ( 3.2 ). Accounting for
scale-dependent logarithms present in the power spectrum ( 2.25 ), one
finds

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

This expression is to be expanded uniformly to @xmath in slow-variation
parameters. It is therefore valid up to next-order corrections in the
slow-variation approximation.

There is another reason to study @xmath , which is related to
Maldacena’s factorisation rule. We have explained that large logarithms
of the form @xmath or @xmath are to be expected in the squeezed limit
@xmath , describing variation of the bispectrum with shape. The power
spectrum @xmath contains similar large logarithms. Since copies of the
power spectrum must be factored out to obtain @xmath , one may
anticipate it to be more regular in the squeezed limit. Indeed, a more
precise statement is possible. Partitioning the momenta into a single
soft mode of order @xmath and two hard modes both of order @xmath ,
Maldacena’s consistency condition requires [ 66 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

as @xmath , where the right-hand side is to be evaluated at horizon exit
for the mode @xmath . It is clear from Eq. ( 3.11 ) that, in this limit,
two and three-point correlators talk to each other. Both sides of Eq. (
3.11 ) are finite and independent of any logarithms associated with the
squeezed limit; this factorisation procedure absorbs all the power-law
and logarithmic divergences.

For each operator @xmath , we write the corresponding @xmath as @xmath
and quote it in the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

In Tables 3.4 and 3.5 we give explicit expressions for the coefficient
functions @xmath and @xmath specialised for equilateral ⁶ ⁶ 6 The quoted
quantity is @xmath , which is not the same as @xmath for which
constraints are typically given [ 162 , 6 ] . To obtain @xmath , one
should take an appropriately normalised inner product (see § 4.2 for a
simple example) between the full next-order bispectrum shape and the
equilateral template [ 170 , 171 ] . and squeezed triangular
configurations. Table 3.5 confirms that @xmath in Eq. ( 3.12 ) is finite
in the squeezed limit, as required.

In the next sections we explore our calculation of the bispectrum. We
start by applying our results to popular single-field models.

### 3.3 Canonical single-field inflation

The simplest model of inflation is that of a single, canonical scalar
field dominating the inflation era. Maldacena showed that the
fluctuations in this model are almost Gaussian, with @xmath being
unobservably small [ 66 ] . In a canonical model, scalar field
fluctuations propagate at the speed of light, @xmath .

Nonlinearity parameter .—To calculate @xmath we need to know the
expressions for the flow parameters @xmath , which measure the
time-dependence in @xmath of Eq. ( 3.4 ). These are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath                              (3.13)
              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

In this model the time-dependence of @xmath is described by @xmath .
Collecting contributions from Table 3.4 , we find the equilateral limit
of @xmath , which we shall denote by @xmath , is

  -- -- -- --------
           (3.14)
  -- -- -- --------

where we have used the numerical constant @xmath , and @xmath is the
common momentum scale, @xmath . Likewise, the squeezed limit may be
recovered from Table 3.5 . We find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is now the scale of the hard momenta, @xmath . In § 3.2.2
we emphasized that @xmath should be finite in this limit, containing no
large logarithms, because these factorise into the power spectrum and
are subtracted upon division. The surviving logarithms [the @xmath terms
in Eq. ( 3.15 )] track the dependence of @xmath on the hard scale, and
will be studied below. Using Eq. ( 3.11 ) and comparing with the
spectral indices quoted in Table 2.1 , it is easy to check that our
formula correctly reproduces Maldacena’s limit.

### 3.4 Non-canonical single-field inflation

For the non-canonical action ( 2.1 ), the @xmath can be written as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.16)
              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath                     
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where we have defined @xmath , @xmath [ 45 ] , and @xmath .

In the canonical case, it was possible to verify Maldacena’s consistency
condition to next-order. In the non-canonical case this is not possible
without a next-next-order calculation, because for @xmath the leading
contribution to @xmath is first-order in the slow-variation expansion.
Therefore our calculation of subleading corrections produces a result
valid to @xmath , which is short of the @xmath accuracy required to
verify the consistency condition at next-order. Chen et al. gave the
subleading corrections in terms of undetermined integrals [ 45 ] .
Expanding these asymptotically, they argued that the consistency
relation would be satisfied at lowest-order. More recently, Renaux-Petel
[ 169 ] gave an equivalent demonstration. Here, we have knowledge of the
full bispectrum to subleading order. Using Eq. ( 3.16 ), it can be
verified that in the squeezed limit, and expanding around a reference
scale @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

One may check that this agrees with Eq. ( 3.11 ) and Table 2.1 .

#### 3.4.1 Asymptotically power-law models

Power-law inflationary models were introduced by Lucchin & Matarrese [
172 , 173 ] , who studied potentials producing an expansion history of
the form @xmath , where @xmath is a constant. This describes an
inflating solution. Exact solutions can be found in the canonical case,
upon which the next-order calculation was based [ 106 ] .

In this section we study two examples which are asymptotically described
by non-canonical power-law inflation at late times. The first is
Dirac–Born–Infeld (DBI) inflation, which produces a scale-invariant
power spectrum of perturbations at leading-order. Departures from
scale-invariance appear at next-order in the slow-roll approximation.
This special property implies that we can compare our results to a
formula of Khoury & Piazza which was obtained without invoking the
slow-roll approximation, but where a scale-invariant spectrum was
imposed [ 174 ] . Here we expand the discussion initiated in § 1.3.2 .
Our second example is @xmath -inflation, for which the power spectrum is
not scale-invariant at lowest-order, and to which Khoury & Piazza’s
result does not apply.

##### Dirac–Born–Infeld inflation

The DBI action is a low-energy effective theory which describes a
D3-brane moving in warped space. It was proposed as a model of inflation
by Silverstein & Tong [ 27 ] , and subsequently developed with
Alishahiha [ 74 ] . The action is of the form ( 2.1 ), with @xmath
satisfying

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is an arbitrary function of @xmath known as the warp
factor, and @xmath is the potential arising from couplings between the
brane and other degrees of freedom. The DBI Lagrangian is non-analytical
but algebraically special [ 111 , 160 , 175 ] . It enjoys a number of
remarkable properties, including a form of non-renormalisation theorem [
176 , 177 , 178 ] ; its invariance under a higher-dimensional boost
makes DBI one rare example of a radiatively stable higher-derivative
model against quantum corrections.

In principle in the DBI action non-minimal curvature couplings can be
present, of the form @xmath , which spoil inflation [ 179 ] . This gives
a form of the @xmath -problem, and we assume such terms to be
negligible.

It is conventional to define a Lorentz factor as follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

When @xmath the motion of the brane in the warped throat is
nonrelativistic. When @xmath , the brane is moving close to the speed
limit. The Lorentz factor is related to the speed of sound of
perturbations by @xmath . In the limit @xmath , the scalar fluctuations
around background solutions of the action ( 3.18 ) propagate at small
sound speed, which is related to large non-gaussianities. The square
root in Eq. ( 3.18 ) must be real, imposing a dynamical speed limit for
@xmath .

Eq. ( 3.18 ) makes @xmath , which requires @xmath but causes the
denominator of @xmath given in Eq. ( 3.16 ) to diverge. Only the finite
combination @xmath appears in the physical, observable quantity @xmath ,
and it can indeed be checked that @xmath as required.

“Traditional” DBI inflation scenario .—Silverstein & Tong [ 27 ]
obtained attractor solutions supported by ( 3.18 ) and specific forms of
the potential and warping, which were described at late times by
power-law inflation. In this limit, the slow-variation parameters @xmath
and @xmath are constant, with @xmath , but @xmath does not vanish.
Variation of the sound speed gives @xmath , making @xmath and yielding
scale-invariant fluctuations at leading-order in slow-roll [cf. Eq. (
2.26 )] [ 174 ] . In the equilateral limit, ⁷ ⁷ 7 Recall that the
equilateral limit is @xmath , and not the quantity constrained by
experiment. we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

In § 2.1 we have estimated the relative uncertainty in @xmath to be
@xmath , working in the limit @xmath , based on @xmath terms from the
vertices ( 3.4 ) only. Eq. ( 3.20 ) shows that, because of an apparently
fortuitous cancellation, this large contribution is almost completely
subtracted, leaving a small fractional correction of only @xmath .

In the squeezed limit we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is @xmath , as predicted by Maldacena’s condition ( 3.11 ) and the
property @xmath [ 74 ] .

Comparison with previous results .—Khoury & Piazza estimated the
bispectrum in a power-law inflationary model satisfying exact
scale-invariance, @xmath , without invoking an expansion in
slow-variation parameters [ 174 ] . They quoted their results in terms
of a quantity @xmath which replaces @xmath , as follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

For the DBI model, @xmath . They assumed constant @xmath , making their
result valid to all orders in @xmath but only lowest-order in the time
dependence of @xmath . Working in the equilateral limit for arbitrary
but constant @xmath , we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

Adopting the evaluation point @xmath , this precisely reproduces Khoury
& Piazza’s Eq. (8.4) [ 174 ] when expanded to first-order in @xmath .
Although Eq. ( 3.23 ) does not rigorously apply to DBI, where @xmath and
thus @xmath are changing, it can be checked that effects due to the
time-dependence of @xmath do not appear at next-order. Indeed, Eq. (
3.23 ) yields Eq. ( 3.20 ) when @xmath .

Generalized DBI inflation .—The analysis above was restricted to the
asymptotic power-law regime first obtained by Silverstein & Tong [ 27 ]
, but this is not required. Using an arbitrary potential @xmath in the
action ( 3.18 ) one can in principle construct a generic quasi-de Sitter
background. Many of their properties, including the attractor behaviour,
were studied by Franche et al. in Ref. [ 180 ] .

How can we learn about the shape of the potential from observables such
as @xmath ? We will show that through the next-order terms in @xmath we
will be able to estimate corrections arising from the shape of @xmath or
@xmath . Analogous effects have been computed for galileon inflation [
28 ] , but our computation enables us to determine them in the DBI
scenario for the first time. This is particularly relevant since the
motivation behind DBI lies in brane inflation scenarios, and we can now
gain access to compactification data which was previously hard, or even
impossible to obtain by other means.

For @xmath the non-canonical structure suppresses the background
dependence on details of the potential. But small fluctuations around
the background cannot be shielded from these details, which induce
three-body interactions whether or not they are relevant for supporting
the quasi-de Sitter epoch. These interactions generate relatively
unsuppressed contributions to the three-point function.

We adapt the notation of Franche et al. [ 180 ] , who defined quantities
measuring the shape of the potential @xmath and the warping @xmath ⁸ ⁸ 8
The factor @xmath was not used by Franche et al. [ 180 ] , but is
necessary here because the relativistic background solution requires
@xmath up to corrections suppressed by @xmath , which are higher-order
than those we retain. Depending on the direction of motion, this yields
@xmath . The choice of sign is important in obtaining the correct
mapping between @xmath and @xmath , and others.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

The same branch of @xmath should be chosen in computing @xmath and
@xmath . Note that these shape parameters do not coincide with the
‘global’ slow-variation parameters @xmath and @xmath defined in Eq. (
2.8 ). Franche et al. argued that @xmath was required to obtain
attractor solutions, which we will assume to be satisfied in what
follows. In addition, we work in the equilateral limit and take @xmath ,
which is the regime of principal interest for observationally large
@xmath . With these assumptions we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

The leading-order term of Eq. ( 3.20 ) is unchanged, but the subleading
terms are dominated by shape-dependent corrections, as follows:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

These subleading terms are more important than those present in Eq. (
3.20 ), which began at relative order @xmath and are therefore strongly
suppressed for @xmath . Moreover, upon inspection of Eq. ( 3.25 ),
inflation can occur even for relatively large values of @xmath and
@xmath , roughly whenever @xmath —hence these corrections need not be
extremely small.

For large @xmath , we estimate the relative correction to the
leading-order @xmath to be

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

For negative equilateral @xmath , current constraints roughly require
@xmath [ 6 ] . Therefore, these corrections can be rather important
unless the potential is tuned to be flat, although some cancellation
occurs because @xmath and @xmath enter with opposite signs.

To obtain an estimate, we suppose for simplicity that @xmath is
negligible. Taking the extreme @xmath -confidence value @xmath [ 6 ] ,
and @xmath for a “generic” potential, the correction is of order @xmath
if @xmath and @xmath if @xmath . To reduce these shifts we might be
prepared to assume @xmath , which suppresses the correction to the
percent level. Nevertheless, the corrections grow with decreasing @xmath
. Keeping the generic estimate @xmath , and using @xmath , ⁹ ⁹ 9 For
these values @xmath and the approximation @xmath used to derive Eq. (
3.27 ) is at the limit of its applicability. we find the corrections to
be of order @xmath for @xmath and @xmath for @xmath . ¹⁰ ¹⁰ 10 In
producing these estimates we are discarding constraints arising from the
normalisation of the power spectrum. These are significant and cannot be
ignored.

Although Franche et al. argued that @xmath must be small to obtain
attractor behaviour, it need not be entirely negligible. In such cases
it introduces a dependence on the shape of the warp factor in addition
to the shape of the potential. This may be positive or negative. If the
@xmath and @xmath terms add constructively, the next-order correction
can become rather large. This, however, will be very model-dependent.

Infrared model .—The DBI scenario can be realized in several ways. The
original “ultraviolet” model is now disfavoured by microscopic
considerations [ 109 , 111 ] . Chen introduced an alternative “infrared”
implementation [ 181 , 182 , 183 ] which evades these constraints and
remains compatible with observation [ 112 , 184 , 185 , 186 ] . In this
infrared version of DBI inflation, the warp factor @xmath is that of an
AdS throat @xmath , where @xmath is a dimensionless parameter. The
potential is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

in which the mass is expressed as a fraction @xmath of the Hubble scale.
The constant term @xmath dominates, making @xmath negligible, but the
remaining slow-variation parameters need not be small. It is convenient
to express our results in terms of the number e-folds to the end of
inflation, @xmath , which satisfies @xmath . Background quantities
evaluated at this time carry a subscript ‘ @xmath .’

Evaluating Eq. ( 3.25 ) for these choices of @xmath and @xmath , we
obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

The infrared model is an example where @xmath is not negligibly small.
Using Eq. ( 3.27 ), we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have chosen @xmath in the final step. Adopting the best-fit
value @xmath suggested by Bean et al. [ 112 ] , we find the fractional
correction is of order @xmath . This relatively small correction is a
consequence of the negligible value of @xmath in this model. Keeping
@xmath and using the maximum likelihood value @xmath quoted by Bean et
al., we find @xmath . The corresponding shift is from @xmath without
next-order corrections to @xmath with next-order corrections included.
This can be measured by Planck .

We conclude that next-order corrections not only need to be taken into
account to keep the theory-error below Planck ’s sensitivity, but they
can also reveal important details about the potential and warping in DBI
inflation scenarios.

##### @xmath-inflation

Another model that admits power-law solutions was proposed by
Armendáriz-Picón, Damour & Mukhanov [ 26 ] , and is known as @xmath
-inflation. The action is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is some constant, no longer related to the speed of sound
by the formula @xmath which applied for DBI. Unlike the DBI Lagrangian,
Eq. ( 3.30 ) is not radiatively stable and its microscopic motivation is
uncertain. Nevertheless, non-gaussian properties of the inflationary
fluctuations in this toy model were studied by Chen et al. [ 45 ] .

There exists a solution of the action ( 3.30 ) with

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

making @xmath and @xmath constant. Therefore this model has @xmath , but
non-vanishing @xmath , and is thus not scale-invariant. Inflation occurs
in the regime for which @xmath . This already requires a relatively
tight constraint on the allowed values for @xmath . The leading-order
contribution to @xmath is of order @xmath , making the next-order term
of order unity. A next-next-order calculation would be required to
accurately estimate the term of order @xmath .

In the equilateral limit, Chen et al. [ 45 ] quoted the leading-order
result

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proceeding as in § 2.1 by focusing on the interaction vertices @xmath
given in Eq. ( 3.4 ), one can estimate the fractional theoretical
uncertainty in this prediction to be @xmath , or roughly @xmath . This
is comparable to Planck ’s error bar, and is likely to exceed the error
bar achieved by a subsequent CMB satellite. Still working in the
equilateral limit, we find

  -- -- -- --------
           (3.32)
  -- -- -- --------

Like for DBI inflation, a fortuitous cancellation brings the fractional
correction down from our initial estimate @xmath to @xmath with all the
next-order corrections taken into account. It was not necessary to
choose a reference scale @xmath in order to evaluate Eq. ( 3.32 ); in
@xmath -inflation, @xmath is scale-invariant even though the power
spectrum is not.

Comparison with previous results .—Because @xmath in this model, the
analysis of Khoury & Piazza does not apply. In another paper, however,
Noller & Magueijo presented a generalisation which was intended to be
valid for constant, but otherwise arbitrary @xmath and @xmath , and
small @xmath [ 187 ] . Their analysis also assumes constant @xmath ,
which is not a good approximation in the regime of rapidly varying speed
of sound. For comparison, we set the reference scale to be @xmath and
work in the equilateral limit for arbitrary constant @xmath . One finds

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

For @xmath , both Eq. ( 3.33 ) and Noller & Magueijo’s formula (A.15)
reduce to Eq. ( 3.23 ).

For @xmath , Eq. ( 3.33 ) disagrees with Noller & Magueijo’s result.
This occurs partially because they approximate the propagator ( 2.24 )
using the elementary wavefunction ( 2.23 ) in the super-horizon limit
@xmath ; in this limit details of the interference between growing and
decaying modes around the time of horizon exit are lost. For example,
their approximation discards the @xmath -contributions of Eq. ( A.2 )
although these are @xmath and as large as other contributions which are
retained. But were these terms kept, the super-horizon limit @xmath
could not be used to estimate them. Infrared safety of the @xmath
integrals in Eqs. ( 3.8 ) is spoiled if truncated at any finite order,
causing incorrect divergences in the squeezed limit @xmath and a
spurious contribution to the bispectrum with a local shape. As we
explain in Appendices A.1 and A.2 , it appears that—as a point of
principle—if @xmath corrections are kept, then the shape of the
bispectrum can be accurately determined only if the full time-dependence
of each wavefunction around the time of horizon exit is retained.

Another reason for the discrepancy with our results lies in the dynamics
assumed for the scale factor. Even though Ref. [ 187 ] assumed small
deviations from a perfectly scale-invariant spectrum of perturbations,
their analysis used a scale-invariant evolution for the scale factor. As
a result, their calculation dismisses contributions to the background
dynamics as relevant as others kept in the evolution of the
wavefunctions.

### 3.5 Tensor modes

We conclude our report on slow-roll corrections by studying the
implications to tensor modes. Inflation has inevitably produced tensor
fluctuations to accompany the scalar fluctuation @xmath . Detecting the
B-mode polarisation signal produced by these fluctuations is a major aim
of the Planck satellite and future CMB experiments [ 188 ] . If
measured, this signal will provide important constraints on the energy
scale of inflation. Above all, it will be a strong indication that an
inflationary period took place in the early universe.

In certain models the tensor sector provides sufficient observables to
allow one or more quantities, such as @xmath , to be written in terms of
other observables. These consistency relations were introduced by
Copeland et al. [ 189 , 190 ] , and are completely decoupled of the way
we choose to parametrise the theory. To be used effectively with the
next-order results obtained in this chapter, we will require next-order
predictions for the tensor modes. These were first obtained by Stewart &
Lyth [ 102 ] , and are unchanged by the non-canonical action ( 2.1 ) for
the scalar field.

The tensor fluctuation is a propagating spin-2 mode which belongs to
@xmath of the ADM metric ( 2.5 ). We write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath . At quadratic order, the action for tensor fluctuations is
[ 191 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

As described in § 2.2.1 , the tensor perturbations decouple, at
quadratic order, from the scalar modes. There are two polarisations,
traditionally denoted ‘ @xmath ’ and ‘ @xmath ,’ making @xmath
transverse, @xmath . Introducing a reference scale @xmath as in § 2.2.2
and adding both polarisations, the resulting dimensionless spectrum can
be written [ 102 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

This result is equal to the sum of two copies of the power spectrum for
a massless scalar field with @xmath , and so @xmath is also conserved on
super-horizon scales (there is no residual time-dependence in the
answer). Including next-order corrections and for arbitrary @xmath , the
scale-dependence of @xmath is measured by the tilt @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is conventional to measure the amplitude of tensor fluctuations
relative to @xmath . One defines the tensor-to-scalar ratio, @xmath , by
the rule [ 190 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the dimensionless version of the scalar power spectrum (
2.25 ). We find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

In canonical models, @xmath can be written purely in terms of observable
quantities. In the non-canonical case this is not automatically possible
without the addition of new observables. In general,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

One may use the lowest-order result for @xmath to eliminate @xmath . To
eliminate @xmath would require the scalar spectral index, @xmath . It is
possible to use @xmath to rewrite @xmath in the prefactor [ 111 ] , but
in doing so one introduces dependence on the parameter @xmath .
Therefore at least two extra observables would be required to eliminate
the dependence on @xmath and @xmath . If these depend on @xmath , @xmath
or similar parameters, then further observables could be required.

We conclude that at next-order in slow-roll, for a general @xmath
Lagrangian, the observables @xmath do not form a closed set. As we shall
see in § 4.3.2 , the consistency relations derived after modal
decomposition of the bispectrum are able to circumvent this degeneracy,
provided a sufficient number of observables (with comparable accuracy)
is available.

### 3.6 Main results

This chapter is one of the main backbones of this thesis, which we
attempt to summarise here. In the (very) near future, we expect key
cosmological observables to be determined to high-precision. In
particular, Planck is expected to deliver data in less than one year’s
time, and may determine the scalar spectral index @xmath to an accuracy
of roughly one part in @xmath [ 192 ] . The level of precision reached
by the present CMB experiments can only be exploited effectively if our
theoretical predictions keep pace. In this chapter we have focused on
three essential questions:

1.  How accurate are the theoretical estimates of the bispectrum?

2.  How can we reduce the theory-error of our estimates to be in line
    with the sensitivity set by Planck ?

3.  How can we efficiently explore Planck ’s data on the primordial
    bispectrum, and therefore learn more about the microphysics of the
    early universe?

The first two questions, and partly the last one, have been addressed in
this chapter. The last question will be explored in detail in chapter 4
.

Almost twenty years ago, Stewart & Lyth [ 102 ] obtained analytic
formulae for the two-point function accurate to next-order in the
slow-roll parameter @xmath . Subsequent observational developments have
restricted attention to a region of the parameters space where @xmath is
a good approximation, making the leading-order prediction for the power
spectrum an accurate match for experiment. There is no reason to believe
the same will remain true for three- and higher @xmath -point
correlations, which will be experimentally probed with Planck .

The results of § 3.4 show that next-order corrections to @xmath in the
equilateral mode may be comparable to Planck ’s observational precision.
For a future CMB satellite it is actually conceivable that the data will
be more precise than a leading-order estimate. In this chapter we have
reported a next-order calculation of the bispectrum in the slow-roll
approximation applicable to all single-field inflationary models: those
belonging to the Horndeski class, which includes models described by a
Lagrangian of the form @xmath , where @xmath . Our calculation has so
far focused on the magnitude of the bispectrum, @xmath , and in many
models it provides a much more precise estimate than the lowest-order
result.

Our major results can be categorised into two groups, as follows.

#### Accuracy and precision

Except in special cases where exact results are possible, ¹¹ ¹¹ 11
Amongst such exceptions are the results of Khoury & Piazza for constant
@xmath discussed in § 3.4 , and the calculation described in chapter 5 .
predictions for observable quantities have so far been presented with a
theory-error encapsulating uncertainty due to small contributions which
had not been calculated. For inflationary observables the typical scale
of the theory-error is set by the accuracy of the slow-variation
approximation, where the dimensionless quantities @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath (and others) are taken to be small. These are the assumptions of
the slow-roll approximation, on which the results of this chapter are
based. To obtain numerical estimates, we have applied our results to
some models.

Power-law DBI inflation and @xmath -inflation .—In § 2.1 and §§ 3.4.1 –
3.4.1 we estimated the precision which could be ascribed to the
leading-order formula for @xmath in the absence of a complete
calculation of next-order effects. Using the next-order contributions
from the vertices @xmath in Eqs. ( 3.4 ), which can be obtained without
detailed calculation, we estimated the fractional uncertainty to be of
order @xmath (or as large as @xmath ) for DBI and @xmath (or as large as
6%) for @xmath -inflation. The prospect of such large uncertainties,
also pointed out by Adshead et al. [ 193 ] , demands carrying out the
full computation of all next-order terms in the slow-roll approximation.

In DBI and @xmath -inflation scenarios, we find the terms omitted from
these estimates generate large cancellations, in each case reducing the
next-order contribution by roughly @xmath . This is similar to what was
observed by Gong & Stewart in their calculation of next-next-order
corrections to the power spectrum [ 104 ] . Having done this
calculation, it seems reasonable to infer that the contributions from
@xmath systematically overpredict the next-order terms. But this could
not have been anticipated without a calculation of all next-order
effects. Therefore, for power-law DBI and @xmath -inflation models we
conclude that the leading-order calculation is unexpectedly accurate.

Generalised DBI inflation .—The situation is different for a generalised
DBI model with arbitrary potential @xmath and warp factor @xmath . The
largest next-order corrections measure a qualitatively new effect, not
included in the power-law solution, arising from the shape of @xmath and
@xmath . The fractional shift was quoted in Eq. ( 3.27 ) and can be
large, because the DBI action supports inflation even on relatively
steep potentials, for which @xmath and @xmath may not be very small.
Indeed, if one were to tune the potential to be flat, say @xmath , then
much of the motivation for a higher-derivative model would have been
lost. Even for rather large values of @xmath , the correction can be
several tens of percent for an “untuned” potential with @xmath
(maintaining @xmath and @xmath small). For slightly smaller values of
@xmath , the correction is increasingly significant, perhaps growing to
@xmath . The formulae quoted in § 3.4.1 assume @xmath and would require
modification for very small @xmath where @xmath corrections need not be
negligible. If desired, these can be obtained from our full formulae
tabulated in § 3.1 .

Infrared DBI inflation .—In the infrared DBI scenario proposed by Chen [
181 , 182 , 183 ] , we find the correction to be @xmath for parameter
values currently favoured by observation, which translates to reasonably
large shifts in @xmath . For the maximum-likelihood parameter values
suggested by the analysis of Bean et al. [ 184 ] , we find that
next-order corrections increase the magnitude of @xmath by a shift
@xmath . This is a little smaller than the error bar which Planck is
expected to achieve, but nevertheless of comparable magnitude. We
conclude that a next-order calculation will be adequate for Planck , but
if the model is not subsequently ruled out, a next-next-order
calculation may be desirable for a CMBPol - or CoRE -type satellite.

#### Technical results

Our calculation includes a number of more technical results, listed
below.

Treatment of boundary terms .—In § 2.3.1 we gave a systematic treatment
of boundary terms in the third-order action for @xmath . Although these
terms were properly accounted for in previous results [ 66 , 88 , 45 ] ,
these calculations used a field redefinition which was not guaranteed to
remove all terms in the boundary action.

Our calculation has also shown how the cubic action could be written in
terms of a minimal number of five Horndeski operators, given in Eq. (
3.3 ).

Pure shape logarithms .—The subleading correction to the propagator
contains an exponential integral contribution whose time-dependence
cannot be described by elementary functions [ 104 , 45 , 28 ] . This
term contributes at the level of the internal legs of the Feynman
diagram. We argue that it must be handled carefully to avoid unphysical
infrared divergences in the squeezed limit, where one momentum goes to
zero. In Appendix A.2 we describe how this contribution yields the
@xmath functions given in Eqs. ( 3.8 ). These are obtained using
resummation and analytic continuation techniques introduced in Ref. [ 28
] .

The possibility of spurious divergences in the squeezed limit shows
that, as a matter of principle, one should be cautious when determining
the shape of the bispectrum generated by an approximation to the
elementary wavefunctions. Obtaining the quantitatively correct momentum
behaviour requires all details of the interference in time between
growing and decaying modes near horizon exit. The possibility of such
interference effects, absent in classical mechanics, is a typical
feature of quantum mechanical processes. This interference correctly
resolves the unwanted divergences in the infrared limit @xmath with
@xmath , as discussed in detail in Appendices A.1 and A.2 .

Comparison with known results .—We have verified Maldacena’s consistency
condition ( 3.11 ) to next-order in canonical models by doing an
explicit calculation of the full bispectrum. This agrees with a recent
calculation by Renaux-Petel [ 169 ] . This matching depends carefully on
keeping track of the scale and shape logarithms available in the
next-order terms in slow-roll.

In the case of power-law inflation with a scale-invariant spectrum of
scalar perturbations, @xmath , and constant @xmath and @xmath , we
reproduce a known result derived by Khoury & Piazza [ 174 ] . A subset
of our corrections was computed by Chen et al. [ 45 ] . Up to
first-order terms in powers of slow-roll quantities—where our results
can be compared—we find exact agreement.

## Chapter 4 Decoding the Bispectrum of Single-Field Inflation

This chapter reports a thorough investigation of the properties of the
bispectrum in single-field inflation, based on the results obtained in
chapter 3 . The main object of study will be the scale and the
shape-dependences of the bispectrum. They offer very insightful
information about the microphysics of the early universe, and together
with the amplitude @xmath , they fully characterise the bispectrum as an
intricate ‘three-dimensional’ object. This chapter is therefore
complementary to chapter 3 .

Outline .—We obtain in § 4.1 a generic formula for the overall running
of @xmath with scale in single-field inflation theories. This is
particularly important if we want to use data collected at different
scales—the ability to use different sets of data makes the constraints
on the parameters of the theory tighter [ 194 ] .

In § 4.2 we catalogue the Horndeski shapes appearing at leading and
next-order in the slow-roll approximation. We identify what appears to
be a ‘new’ bispectrum shape uncorrelated with the common templates used
in CMB analysis. This shape can show up both at leading and at
next-order in the slow-roll approximation, and it had appeared before in
a galileon model constructed by Creminelli et al. [ 11 ] . To explain
the recurrent emergence of this shape we decompose in § 4.3 the
primordial bispectrum into fundamental harmonics. We elaborate on the
consistency relations obtained between the amplitudes of each
fundamental eigenmode, and discuss their usefulness. We present in § 4.4
a summary of our findings.

This chapter contains material discussed in Ref. [ 1 ] in collaboration
with Clare Burrage & David Seery, and Ref. [ 2 ] in collaboration with
David Seery.

### 4.1 Scale-dependence

As we discussed in § 3.2 , we can use the logarithms @xmath and @xmath
to study the scale-dependence of the three-point function. In the
squeezed limit this is determined by Maldacena’s consistency condition (
3.11 ). The only scale which survives the factorisation procedure is the
common hard momentum @xmath , and the variation of @xmath with this
scale is dictated by the variation of @xmath . This is typically called
the running with scale of the scalar spectral index [ 195 ] . It follows
that the running of Eq. ( 3.11 ) leads to a further consistency relation
inherited from Maldacena’s. ¹ ¹ 1 In general, a hierarchy of such
consistency equations can be generated by taking an arbitrary number of
derivatives of both sides of Eq. ( 3.11 )—this has been investigated in
Ref. [ 196 ] . However, so far only the first of such derivatives has
been the subject of investigation. In the case of single-field canonical
inflation, studied in § 3.3 , we were able to verify this explicitly.

Away from the squeezed limit, deformations of the momentum triangle may
change either its shape or scale. Scale dependence appears in all
models, for the same reason that the spectrum @xmath and spectral index
@xmath depend on scale [ 57 , 66 , 88 , 67 , 45 ] .

As the spectral index measures the running of the power spectrum with
scale, one can similarly apply the same technique to the bispectrum.
Chen [ 183 ] introduced a tilt of @xmath , denoted by @xmath and defined
by ² ² 2 Chen implicitly worked in the equilateral limit @xmath , for
which @xmath and @xmath . We are defining @xmath to be the variation of
@xmath with the perimeter of an arbitrary triangular configuration with
fixed shape.

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

For a fixed triangular shape, this measures changes in @xmath as the
perimeter varies. Scale-dependence of this type was subsequently studied
by several authors [ 197 , 175 ] . Observational constraints have been
determined by Sefusatti et al. [ 198 ] . Byrnes et al. performed a
similar analysis in multiple-field models producing a local bispectrum [
199 , 200 ] . They allowed for deformations of the momentum triangle
including a change of shape, but found these to be less important than
rescalings of @xmath .

As we shall see in the next section, shape-dependence is often
substantially more complicated than scale-dependence. By construction,
Eq. ( 3.2 ) makes @xmath dimensionless, but contains both powers and
logarithms of the momenta @xmath . The powers occur as dimensionless
ratios in which @xmath does not appear, but the shape-dependence
remains. The argument of each logarithmic term is also a dimensionless
ratio, but an extra scale becomes available: the reference scale @xmath
. When present, this gives rise to the scaling logarithms @xmath and
@xmath , which depend on @xmath as well as the shape. In particular we
observe that any @xmath appears in the form @xmath ; said differently,
all the dependence of the triangle with scale is rescaled with respect
to the pivot scale, @xmath .

It follows that a simple way to track the @xmath -dependence of @xmath
is through the @xmath -logarithms:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

For an arbitrary Horndeski model, @xmath can be written

  -- -- -- -------
           (4.3)
  -- -- -- -------

where the functions @xmath correspond to dimensionless ratios of
polynomials of @xmath and are listed in Table 4.1 .

Squeezed and equilateral limits .—In the equilateral limit, we find

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

The squeezed limit gives a simpler result,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

To illustrate an application of the hierarchy condition deduced from
Maldacena’s consistency condition ( 3.11 ), we define the running of the
spectral index, @xmath , by [ 195 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

Compatibility with Eq. ( 3.11 ) in the squeezed limit requires

  -- -- -- -------
           (4.7)
  -- -- -- -------

For canonical single field inflation, discussed in § 3.3 , specializing
to the equilateral limit of @xmath , we find

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the squeezed limit one obtains

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

which describes the running of the scalar spectral index, @xmath , in
agreement with Eq. ( 3.11 ). The consistency conditions ( 3.15 ) and (
4.9 ) represent a nontrivial check on the correctness of our
calculation. Throughout the calculation we have carefully separated the
conceptually different scales @xmath and @xmath . Therefore the correct
formula ( 4.9 ) is not simply a consequence of obtaining the correct
leading-order terms in Eq. ( 3.15 ). It rather depends on a careful
matching between the spectral index and @xmath in this limit.

As anticipated, @xmath in non-canonical models. Therefore a
next-next-order calculation is required to estimate the running of
@xmath in these models; this will be slow-roll suppressed compared to
@xmath itself.

### 4.2 Shape-dependence

In the early days of computing next-order corrections to the power
spectrum, pioneered by Stewart & Lyth [ 102 ] , the main purpose was to
obtain an accurate estimate of its amplitude.

In comparison, next-order corrections to the bispectrum can be relevant
for at least three reasons. First, they can change the amplitude of
three-point correlations beyond Planck ’s experimental sensitivity.
Second, as we have seen in the previous section, next-order corrections
allow us to investigate the scale-dependence of the bispectrum. Third,
they could potentially lead to the appearance of new “shapes,” by which
we mean the momentum dependence of @xmath [ 10 ] , defined in Eq. ( 3.1
). In principle, all these three effects are measurable.

The plots and overlapping cosines included in this chapter were produced
by David Seery and originally presented in Refs. [ 1 , 2 ] .

#### 4.2.1 Inner product and cosine

How similar, or dissimilar, are two given bispectrum shapes?
Conservation of 3-momentum in the bispectrum requires that the momenta
@xmath form a triangle in momentum space. The bispectrum is a function
on this space of triangles. Babich et al. [ 10 ] described its
functional form as the “shape” of the bispectrum and introduced a
measure to distinguish qualitatively different shapes. We briefly recall
their method. We define the shape @xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

One can introduce a formal “cosine” which may be used as a quantitative
measure of similarity in shape between different bispectra. The inner
product between two bispectra is defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the integral is to be taken over all triangular configurations of
momenta @xmath . The cosine between @xmath and @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

These expressions require some care. In certain cases the result may be
infinite, requiring the integral to be regulated. This is usually the
case when one of the bispectra peaks in the squeezed configuration. We
will comment on how to deal with these cases next.

Parametrisations .—One can represent each shape @xmath as a function of
the three momenta, @xmath , subject to the @xmath -distribution, that
constrains only two of these to be linearly independent. Take @xmath to
be the privileged scale in the triangle. Then @xmath and @xmath can be
rescaled with respect to @xmath , and @xmath can be represented in terms
of @xmath and @xmath . This is the Babich et al. parametrisation [ 10 ]
, where the shape function is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

There is another useful parametrisation which enhances the symmetry in
surfaces of the shape with equal magnitude. This is the parametrisation
proposed by Fergusson & Shellard [ 9 ] , in which the momenta @xmath in
the inner product ( 4.11 ) can be parametrized geometrically in terms of
the perimeter, @xmath (which becomes the privileged scale), and two
dimensionless ratios. As a result, for scale-invariant correlators only
two variables, denoted @xmath and @xmath , are linearly independent, and
these are defined by [ 9 ]

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.13a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.13b)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.13c)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath and @xmath . The shape function is given by the combination

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The measure @xmath in the integrand of Eq. ( 4.11 ) is proportional to
@xmath . Therefore we can write

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a harmless normalisation which can be divided out. With
this understanding we use Eq. ( 4.14 ) to determine the cosine in Eq. (
4.12 ).

In practice, our bispectra are not scale-invariant and therefore Eq. (
4.14 ) does not strictly apply. However, as we have already studied in §
4.1 the violations of scale-invariance are small, and to a good
approximation Eq. ( 4.14 ) can be used.

Divergences .—As mentioned before, the cosine defined in Eq. ( 4.12 )
requires some care. In particular, Eq. ( 4.14 ) may be infinite. For
example, the well-studied local bispectrum diverges like @xmath or
@xmath in the limit @xmath , @xmath , or like @xmath in the limit @xmath
, @xmath [ 10 ] . These correspond to the squeezed limits discussed in §
3.1 . Eq. ( 4.14 ) therefore exhibits power-law divergences on the
boundaries of the region of integration, and in such cases the integral
must be regulated to obtain a finite answer. For simplicity, we adopt a
sharp cutoff which requires @xmath . As @xmath the cosine ( 4.12 ) may
converge to a nonzero limit if @xmath , @xmath and @xmath diverge at the
same rate.

For this reason, where divergences exist, the value assigned to @xmath
is largely a matter of convention, and should be interpreted as an
indicative number. Nevertheless, to resolve the practical question of
whether two shapes can be distinguished by observation it should be
remembered that experiments cannot measure arbitrarily small wavenumbers
[ 16 ] . Therefore their ability to distinguish shapes peaking in the
squeezed limit is limited. In this case, to obtain accurate forecasts of
what can be distinguished (especially today in anticipation to Planck ’s
results), one should restore the @xmath -dependence in ( 4.14 ) and
restrict the integration to observable wavenumbers, yielding a
manifestly finite answer [ 9 , 201 ] . We do not attempt this here.

##### Template Shapes

It is often useful to compare the bispectrum shapes in a given model
with certain templates. There are essentially four main templates used
in CMB analysis: local ³ ³ 3 See Komatsu & Spergel [ 51 ] and Babich et
al. [ 10 ] . , equilateral ⁴ ⁴ 4 See Babich et al. [ 10 ] . , orthogonal
and enfolded ⁵ ⁵ 5 See Meerburg et al. [ 202 ] and Senatore et al. [ 162
] . . At this point there is a potential issue with the notation used in
this thesis. To distinguish between the equilateral template and the
bispectrum shapes which can peak at the equilateral limit , we use a
different font for the templates . A shape which peaks in the
equilateral limit need not be @xmath correlated with the equilateral
template.

The name attributed to the templates is usually related to the
triangular configuration which maximises the amplitude of the
bispectrum, that is, @xmath . However, that need not be the case. For
example, the orthogonal shape was proposed by Senatore, Smith &
Zaldarriaga [ 162 ] (also see Chen [ 203 ] for a review), and it is
constructed so as to peak both in the equilateral and flattened
configurations (when two of the sides of the triangle are equal to half
the third side).

We quote on table 4.2 the overlap cosines between the four templates
mentioned above. The templates have variable overlap amongst themselves.
For example, the local template overlaps mildly with the equilateral (
@xmath ) template, but significantly with the orthogonal ( @xmath ) and
the enfolded ( @xmath ) templates. The equilateral template is
practically uncorrelated with the orthogonal , by construction, but
overlaps roughly @xmath with the enfolded template. Finally, the
orthogonal template is correlated with the enfolded template roughly
@xmath .

In table 4.3 we depict the four templates in the two different
parametrisations.

#### 4.2.2 Bispectrum shapes from slow-variation parameters

In a model with arbitrary interaction vertices @xmath , the bispectrum
is a linear combination of the shapes produced by the five operators in
the action ( 3.3 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

where each operator @xmath yields a shape @xmath . We will now examine
in detail the shapes arising at leading and next-order in the
slow-variation approximation.

Leading-order shapes .—We quote the cosines of the shapes @xmath ,
computed at lowest-order in the slow-roll approximation, with the common
templates in table 4.4 . We also plot the shapes @xmath in table 4.5 ,
using the two different parametrisations mentioned in § 4.2.1 . The
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath shapes are largely correlated with the
equilateral template. The @xmath and @xmath shapes are in turn
correlated with the local template. In most cases there is a moderate
overlap with the enfolded template, as we would expect from the
correlations between the templates—see table 4.2 .

A ‘new’ shape emerges at leading-order .—What is the overall bispectrum
shape at leading-order? Factoring out an overall normalisation, the
shape @xmath of the bispectrum can be written

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are rescaled versions of the interactions @xmath . ⁶ ⁶ 6
@xmath and @xmath here should not be confused with the @xmath parameters
in the Fergusson-Shellard parametrisation. In a generic model we could
perhaps expect all these ratios to be order unity.

We assume arbitrary @xmath . By adjusting these coefficients it is
possible to find a “critical surface” in the space of bispectrum shapes
on which @xmath becomes orthogonal to the set @xmath . The bispectrum
can be then be written in the form

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.17)
  -- -- -- --------

where the shapes @xmath and @xmath are orthogonal to each template in
@xmath . The coefficients @xmath and @xmath act as coordinates on the
subspace of bispectra orthogonal to these templates, whereas @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath are coordinates labelling departures from this
critical surface. The appropriate choice is

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.18a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.18b)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.18c)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

The shapes @xmath and @xmath then satisfy

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.19a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.19b)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Although we did not require it, these shapes have negligible overlap
with the orthogonal template. But they need not be orthogonal amongst
themselves. To measure independent combinations from data typically
requires a dedicated template which has negligible overlap with other
combinations. We follow the procedure of Refs. [ 162 , 203 ] . The inner
product matrix is @xmath . It is diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix
@xmath whose columns are formed from the eigenvectors of @xmath .
Setting @xmath so that the bispectrum shape lies within the required
critical surface, we write @xmath , and @xmath . The part of the
bispectrum on the critical subspace can be written as @xmath , where
@xmath and @xmath .

The shapes @xmath and @xmath have local -type divergences, which can be
subtracted out by taking a suitable linear combination. This leaves four
independent terms, from which we wish to construct a linear combination
orthogonal to the three templates. We should expect a unique solution.
This can be extracted from @xmath , and is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

This procedure discards the independent linear combination of @xmath and
@xmath . For practical purposes, we expect its divergence in the
squeezed limit to make it almost indistinguishable from the local
template. We ignore it in the equations which follow, although in
principle one should remember that it is present. @xmath is sometimes
confusingly referred to in the literature as “orthogonal” since it
results from an orthogonalisation procedure. We shall rather describe
the shapes constructed this way as orthogonally designed.

We quote the overlap cosines between @xmath and the templates in table
4.6 . In table 4.7 we plot @xmath in the Fergusson & Shellard
parametrisation. Given that this parametrisation highlights the symmetry
of the surface of the shape, it will be very useful in what follows. As
a function of the @xmath there are multiple peaks in the critical
surface, and therefore @xmath is not maximised on a unique type of
triangle.

The shape @xmath smoothly converges to zero in the squeezed limit but
exhibits a distinctive drumlin-shaped features near the corners of the
triangle. This shape will occur in a typical bispectrum with
coefficients which depend on @xmath and @xmath . We find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

How significant is its contribution to the overall bispectrum shape?
Since all prefactors will generically be of order unity, by assumption
of a generic Horndeski model, the question reduces to the relative
magnitudes of @xmath and @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . We find @xmath ,
whereas @xmath . The precise values assigned to @xmath and @xmath depend
on how their squeezed divergences are regulated, but generically we find
@xmath and @xmath . We conclude that @xmath has an amplitude suppressed
by roughly @xmath to @xmath compared with the leading-order shapes, all
of which are well-matched by the standard templates. For the ‘new’ shape
@xmath to be visible requires either :

1.  the leading-order shapes to be suppressed, so that @xmath to an
    accuracy of a few parts in @xmath to @xmath . This could happen in a
    specific model, but requires fine-tuning.

2.  the overall amplitude of the bispectrum to be sufficiently large so
    that the suppressed @xmath is visible. Without a dedicated analysis
    of the signal-to-noise available in the @xmath -channel for a CMB
    survey, it is not possible to know how large the bispectrum must be.
    However, it is unlikely that the signal to noise for @xmath will be
    dramatically better than that for the equilateral template.
    Therefore, it seems reasonable to suggest that the leading-order
    operators would have to produce @xmath in order for the @xmath
    -shape to be visible. This is presently under stress by experimental
    sensitivity [ 170 , 171 , 162 , 6 ] .

We conclude that it is both theoretically and observationally hard to
realise @xmath . There is another curious feature about this shape: it
is extraordinarily similar to a shape encountered by Creminelli et al. [
11 ] , and which we plot on table 4.8 . We will return to this issue in
§ 4.3 .

Enhanced leading-order shapes by a reduced sound speed .—As discussed in
§ 3.1.3 , a @xmath theory imposes strong correlations amongst the @xmath
. In this sense it is not as generic as an arbitrary Horndeski model,
and we might not be able to finely tune the @xmath to produce a ‘new,’
exotic bispectrum shape. In particular, at leading-order, @xmath and
@xmath do not contribute.

We focus on a model with small sound speed, @xmath , in which next-order
corrections are most likely to be observable, and retain only
contributions enhanced by @xmath . The remaining three operators
organise themselves into a family of shapes of the form @xmath , where
@xmath arises only from @xmath , but @xmath is a linear combination of
the shapes produced by @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . The parameter @xmath
is the enhanced part of @xmath , that is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the DBI model @xmath . We plot the shapes @xmath and @xmath in Table
4.9 .

Note that although @xmath involves a linear combination of the
local-shape operators @xmath and @xmath , the @xmath Lagrangian
correlates their amplitudes in such a way that there is no divergence in
the squeezed limit. Both @xmath and @xmath are strongly correlated with
the equilateral template. They are similar to the @xmath - and @xmath
-shapes studied by Creminelli et al. [ 11 ] .

Next-order shapes .—Even though most next-order shapes are largely
correlated with their parent leading-order shape, more shapes become
available at next-order. Naïvely, the family of enhanced bispectra is
labelled by @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and also @xmath . In practice
there is some degeneracy, because the shapes corresponding to these
independent parameters may be strongly correlated. We will see these
degeneracies emerge naturally in our analysis.

The @xmath -enhanced next-order shape can be written as a
linear-combination of shapes proportional to the @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath parameters, modulated by @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

Primed shapes are enhanced by a small sound speed since they multiply
@xmath (prime here just denotes the @xmath -enhanced next-order shapes).
We give overlap cosines between @xmath and @xmath with the standard
templates in Table 4.10 and plot them in Table 4.11 .

Overall these shapes have strong overlaps with the equilateral template.
However, two are quite different in appearance and have a slightly
smaller cosine @xmath with this mode: these are @xmath and @xmath . We
fix two coefficients in ( 4.23 ) by choosing a linear combination
orthogonal to both @xmath and @xmath . Without loss of generality we can
choose these to be @xmath and @xmath . We find the required orthogonal
combination is

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.24a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.24b)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

It is possible this procedure is stronger than necessary. Both @xmath
and @xmath are correlated with the equilateral template, and it may be
sufficient to find a linear combination orthogonal to that. In what
follows, however, we insist on orthogonality with @xmath and @xmath .
For certain values of @xmath the denominator of both @xmath and @xmath
may simultaneously vanish, making the required @xmath and @xmath very
large. This implies that, near these values of @xmath , no shape
orthogonal to both @xmath and @xmath can be found within the validity of
next-order perturbation theory. Therefore, we restrict attention to
those @xmath which allow acceptably small @xmath and @xmath .

This process leaves two linear combinations proportional to @xmath and
@xmath . In principle these can be diagonalized, yielding a pair of
shapes orthogonal to each other and @xmath . However, the @xmath matrix
of inner products between these linear combinations is degenerate.
Therefore, only one member of this pair is physical and can be realised
in a @xmath model. The other is not: it has zero inner product with the
shape ( 4.23 ), and is impossible to realise because of enforced
correlations between coefficients.

We denote the physical orthogonal combination @xmath . It has a
vanishing component proportional to @xmath . This was expected, because
the shape @xmath is the same as @xmath . For this reason, Chen et al. [
45 ] absorbed @xmath into a redefined @xmath . It is indistinguishable
from the lowest-order prediction and could never be observed separately,
which is the origin of the degeneracy. We could have arrived at the same
@xmath by excluding @xmath from ( 4.23 ). Demanding the inner product
with @xmath and @xmath to be zero reproduces the physical linear
combination obtained from diagonalisation.

We plot the shape of @xmath in Table 4.12 . Again, it is very similar to
the highly orthogonal shape constructed by Creminelli et al. [ 11 ]
plotted in table 4.13 . Its dependence on @xmath is modest. For
comparison, we quote the cosine between @xmath and the Creminelli et
al. shape in Table 4.6 . For varying @xmath we find a cosine in the
range @xmath – @xmath , which indicates it would be observationally
difficult to distinguish between these shapes.

In Table 4.13 we also give the overlap cosine with the common templates.
The leading-order shapes @xmath and @xmath are strongly correlated with
the equilateral template, and since @xmath is orthogonal to these by
construction, it also has small cosines with the equilateral template,
of order @xmath . There is a moderate cosine with the local template of
order @xmath – @xmath . The precise value depends on our choice of
@xmath , but the dependence is not dramatic. In Table 4.13 we have used
@xmath . For @xmath the local cosines change by roughly @xmath , but
overlaps with the remaining templates remain stable. @xmath has a cosine
of order @xmath – @xmath with the orthogonal template, and of order
@xmath – @xmath with the enfolded template. We conclude that @xmath it
is not strongly correlated with any of the standard templates used in
CMB analysis.

For completeness and to facilitate the comparison, we include here the
plots of all the orthogonally designed bispectrum shapes. Even if they
could be realised in an inflationary model with severe fine-tuning, they
could not be used to support one theory over another. From the shapes in
table 4.14 , shape @xmath is the one which exhibits sharper features,
with a steeper drumlin base. The remaining shapes appear to be slightly
smoother.

These bispectrum shapes are incredibly similar, with an overlapping
cosine in excess of roughly @xmath . This raises the question of why a
linear combination of dome-like shapes can always give rise to a
drumlin-shape, with much more structure. We will investigate this in the
next section.

### 4.3 Resolving the “drumlin” bispectrum shape

The plots in table 4.14 make it clear that the ‘new,’ orthogonally
designed shape cannot be used as a diagnostic tool to distinguish
between models. However, why is this shape recurrent in the
orthogonalisation procedure?

The drumlin structure increases the number of nodes/anti-nodes in the
bispectrum. One can think of the orthogonalisation procedure as taking
two almost pure Fourier harmonics and constructing an orthogonal
function. The result will be approximately the next available Fourier
harmonic, which by construction will not correlate with the fundamental
modes. This suggests that to understand the appearance of these shapes,
it might be helpful to decompose the bispectrum into some analogue of
Fourier modes. The underlying triangular geometry is different to the
flat intervals which yield Fourier harmonics, so the appropriate
analogue will be a generalised partial wave, though we might refer to
them as fundamental harmonics.

#### 4.3.1 Harmonic decomposition

Although partial-wave decompositions have been usefully applied to
quantum field theory, so far they have not been very popular in
inflationary correlations. Recently, Fergusson et al. [ 9 , 201 ]
introduced an eigenmode decomposition, and emphasised its computational
efficiency. We largely follow their method and notation. Physical
conclusions must be independent of the basis, but the analysis may be
made simpler by an appropriate choice. ⁷ ⁷ 7 For comparison with the
Fergusson et al. basis, we have repeated the analysis using Bessel
functions [ 9 ] . With this choice, convergence is much slower. A
different decomposition was used by Meerburg [ 204 ] .

Fergusson et al. suggested writing each shape function in the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

for some coefficients @xmath (not to be confused with @xmath in § 4.2.2
) and a set of dimensionless basis functions @xmath which are
orthonormal in the inner product ( 4.11 ). The functions @xmath are a
subset of those constructed by Fergusson et al. [ 9 , 201 ] and labelled
@xmath . The @xmath form a basis on a fixed slice at constant @xmath ,
suitable for an approximately scale-invariant primordial bispectrum.
Fergusson et al.’s @xmath are not scale-invariant and are orthonormal in
a three-dimensional inner product which accounts for variation in @xmath
. Our @xmath are constructed using precisely the same procedure, but
because many of the @xmath are degenerate purely as a function of shape
(but not scale) they are projected out of the @xmath . It is in this
sense that the @xmath form a subset of the @xmath .

The choice of @xmath was motivated by numerical considerations, as
follows. Define a complete set of orthonormal polynomials @xmath on the
unit interval @xmath with measure @xmath and introduce separable
quantities @xmath satisfying

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

Fergusson et al. chose @xmath to cancel an unwanted growth in the
bispectrum at large @xmath ; for all details and the construction of the
@xmath we refer to the original literature [ 9 , 201 ] . One may impose
a fixed normalisation for the @xmath if desired. They can be ordered by
defining @xmath and sorting the @xmath in ascending order of @xmath .

Finally, the @xmath are constructed by Gram–Schmidt orthonormalisation
of the ordered @xmath , resulting in a linear combination of separable
functions. This leads to efficiencies in computation, which was the
principal motivation for Refs. [ 9 , 201 ] . One can obtain the
expansion coefficients @xmath for any bispectrum @xmath using the inner
product ( 4.11 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath , then @xmath measures the relative importance of the
@xmath and @xmath modes.

We plot the first few @xmath in Table 4.15 . The @xmath mode is a
constant. The @xmath modes are a good match for the overall shape of
both the equilateral and orthogonal templates. Strong features in the
corners of the triangle, characteristic of the local shape, appear at
higher @xmath . Generically speaking, from @xmath onwards there is more
structure in each harmonic basis.

Any arbitrary bispectrum shape will thus be the product of a linear
combination of the fundamental @xmath basis:

##### Orthogonal combinations

That we can expand a bispectrum shape in fundamental, orthogonalised
harmonics is not surprising. This is always permissible. For our
purposes, however, the @xmath depicted in the table 4.15 are
particularly useful since the first three partial waves provide a very
good description of the equilateral , orthogonal and enfolded templates.
Indeed, these can all be obtained by shifting the equilateral shape by a
constant [ 162 , 203 ] . The @xmath shape is the constant shift. The
“first harmonic,” @xmath , peaks in the equilateral limit, whereas
@xmath peaks in the flattened configuration, where @xmath (this makes
@xmath ).

We quote the expansion coefficients @xmath for the common templates in
table 4.16 , obtained using Eq. ( 4.27 ). For the reasons we have
explained, the equilateral , orthogonal and enfolded templates are
dominated by @xmath , and for higher @xmath we observe the corresponding
@xmath decrease. This explains why the shapes @xmath in Eq. ( 4.20 ) and
@xmath depicted in table 4.12 have negligible overlap with the
orthogonal template, even though this was not guaranteed by its
construction. On the other hand, the local shape does not have a rapidly
convergent expansion because its squeezed divergence requires a
comparatively larger admixture of modes with @xmath . As a result the
@xmath -basis is particularly well-adapted for an efficient description
of the higher-derivative self-interactions of @xmath , like those
arising in DBI inflation, which typically do not generate such
divergences.

The idea that the orthogonalisation method suppresses, by construction,
the coefficients of the first fundamental harmonics @xmath , emerges
from the discussion above. We give @xmath for the various ‘new,’
orthogonally designed shapes discussed in § 4.2.2 on table 4.17 . We
observe that the @xmath shape is projected out entirely both for the
shape of Creminelli et al. and the @xmath -shape in Eq. ( 4.20 ). The
situation for the @xmath shape seems more complicated, as previously
anticipated, and we exclude it from our analysis for simplicity. For the
other two shapes, the @xmath harmonics are not completely removed but
their amplitudes are significantly damped. The largest individual term
in each orthogonalised shape is a nearby higher mode—in this case, the
@xmath term. (This is the next highest, although recall that the precise
ordering of the @xmath is somewhat arbitrary.) There is an admixture of
the other harmonics with smaller amplitudes. Comparison with table 4.15
shows that the large @xmath contribution is essentially responsible for
the common appearance of drumlin features.

In table 4.18 , the right-hand columns give an approximation to each
exact shape, built from the first ten @xmath . We quote the
corresponding cosines in table 4.19 . The approximations are rather
good, resulting in cosines in excess of 0.99. Given a set of trial
shapes, which could presumably be generated by considering arbitrarily
exotic higher-derivative operators in the Lagrangian, this basis could
be constructed precisely by the Gram–Schmidt procedure described in §
4.2.2 .

#### 4.3.2 Distinguishing microphysics

The discussion above implies that, instead of obtaining orthogonal
combinations from the terms in Eq. ( 4.16 ), it may be possible to do
just as well with the @xmath themselves.

As we concluded in the last section, the recurrent appearance of the
drumlin-like shape in table 4.14 suggests that the shape of the
bispectrum itself will not serve as a sensitive discriminant of
microphysics. Most of all, it may not be an appropriate diagnostic tool
compared with the unprecedented sensitivity of Planck ’s data. A
significant local mode will favour dominantly local interactions, driven
by gravitational evolution—usually this is related with a strong
coupling between scalar field fluctuations and the gravity sector. On
the other hand, a significant equilateral mode will favour strong,
higher-derivative self-interactions. However, it seems difficult to be
more precise. Instead of focusing on shapes, it may be more profitable
to study relations between their fundamental amplitudes in order to
distinguish amongst competing inflationary scenarios.

##### Partial-wave amplitudes

To proceed, we define a set of dimensionless amplitudes @xmath for an
arbitrary bispectrum @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the dimensionless power spectrum of the primordial
curvature perturbation. We will elaborate on the scale @xmath below. The
@xmath are similar to the amplitudes @xmath , but they are rather
defined with respect to an inner product.

Any predictive Lagrangian will depend on only a finite number of unknown
parameters. If enough @xmath can be estimated from data, then Eq. ( 4.28
) allows these parameters to be expressed in terms of measurable
quantities. The remaining relations in Eq. ( 4.28 ), when expressed in
terms of these measurable quantities, constitute predictions of the
theory. In the inflationary literature such relationships are typically
known as consistency relations , and were introduced by Copeland et al.
in 1993 [ 189 , 190 ] . In the language of particle physics they are
“observables in terms of observables”—predictions which are independent
on the parametrisation of the theory, and which the renormalisation
programme has taught us represent the physical (not the bare) content of
any quantum field theory. Their power lies precisely in providing
important tests of entire classes of models. These consistency relations
are analogous to the ones derived in § 3.5 on tensor modes.

In practice, the precise @xmath depend on the definition of the inner
product, and indeed will vary between experiments. To perform a
satisfactory analysis, one should obtain survey-dependent predictions
for the @xmath . The primordial bispectrum should be propagated to the
surface of last scattering and projected on to the sky, and the @xmath
should be computed in the resulting two-dimensional inner product. The
set of basis shapes should be orthogonal when measured using the
experiment in question, and may not be directly related to the @xmath .
This will lead to numerically different @xmath for each survey.
Conversely, one can evolve the CMB bispectrum extracted from the data
and the @xmath backwards, to obtain the respective primordial objects,
and then compare them with the theoretical estimates. In either case, a
more precise analysis than the one we attempt to produce here would have
to be performed.

In what follows, we work for illustrative purposes with the primordial,
three-dimensional bispectrum rather than the projected bispectrum. We
make a number of simplifications. We use the inner product ( 4.11 ) in a
scale-invariant approximation, in the sense described in § 3.4.1 . In
evaluating @xmath one must choose a reference scale, @xmath , at which
@xmath is evaluated. The bispectrum then contains scale-dependent
logarithms of the form @xmath , as discussed in § 3.2 , making @xmath
also a function of @xmath . The (dimensionless) power spectrum on the
right-hand side of Eq. ( 4.28 ) is meant to be evaluated at @xmath as
well. Because our implementation of the inner product does not retain
scale information, we cannot apply this prescription precisely. We
replace such logarithms by @xmath , where @xmath is the perimeter of the
triangle. This is likely to make an impact on @xmath at next-order,
which should therefore be considered approximate. However, for the
purposes of illustrating the construction of the coefficients @xmath ,
these assumptions are not restrictive.

We apply the method described above to two different models.

##### Case study: DBI inflation

As an illustration, we consider DBI inflation governed by the action

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.29)
  -- -- -- --------

where @xmath . We discussed this model in § 3.4.1 . This is a special
action in the Horndeski class, and it is known to lead to strong
non-gaussianities if @xmath [ 74 , 45 ] , where @xmath . In what follows
we will be interested in the case where @xmath is, at least, moderate.
The algebraically special structure of the action makes the coefficients
of the Lagrangian operators stable against quantum corrections.

The inflationary fluctuations in this model depend on the parameters
defined in Eq. ( 3.24 ) [ 180 ] , which we recall here

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

where primed quantities are differentiated with respect to @xmath (and
not conformal time). Typically, these must be small. The bispectrum was
determined to @xmath in § 3.4.1 , to which we refer the reader for
details.

The Lagrangian depends on the three parameters in Eq. ( 4.30 ) and
@xmath . We will therefore require four observables to fix them. A
further fifth observable enables the theory to be tested. The presently
well-measured parameters are only the amplitude, @xmath , and tilt,
@xmath , of the scalar power spectrum. There are relatively weak
constraints on a few modes of the bispectrum. In the future, possibly
with Planck , we might be able to detect the tensor amplitude @xmath .
Assuming it will eventually be possible to measure @xmath and @xmath
together with the tensor-to-scalar ratio, @xmath , then using the
results of § 3.4.1 , we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

One of the results from our analysis is that the DBI model predicts
@xmath if the bispectrum is large enough to be observable, as we will
explain below. If @xmath cannot be measured, or only with poor accuracy,
then it will be necessary to use @xmath as a substitute. In this case,
we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

In Eqs. ( 4.31 )–( 4.32 ) we must recall that observables (such as the
@xmath ) may mix Lagrangian parameters at lowest-order, next-order and
possibly other higher-orders. The @xmath begin at lowest-order, whereas
@xmath and @xmath begin at next-order in slow-roll. Indeed, we find this
is the case. This can be seen from inspection of Eqs. ( 4.31 )–( 4.32 ):
the numerical coefficients multiplying @xmath and @xmath differ in both
equations.

In obtaining these equations we have assumed that each term in Eq. (
4.32 ) is roughly of the same order of magnitude, that is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

Which of these two equations, ( 4.31 ) or ( 4.32 ), is more useful will
depend on the relative difficulty of measuring @xmath and @xmath . These
expressions constitute a model-independent test of the DBI framework:
they hold for any DBI action, up to @xmath , no matter what potential or
warp factor is chosen. They are written in terms of observables only. By
showing that relations such as ( 4.31 ) or ( 4.32 ) are not satisfied,
one could rule out the DBI action as the origin of the inflationary
perturbations.

Unfortunately, there is no one-to-one mapping from models to consistency
relations such as ( 4.31 )–( 4.32 ), and determining that any such
equation is satisfied does not provide decisive evidence in favour of a
model. The utility of such equations lies, on the other hand, with their
power to rule models out. Showing that the @xmath satisfy a hierarchy of
consistency equations derived from some Lagrangian would, nevertheless,
be circumstantial evidence in favour of that model, especially if the
agreement persists to large @xmath .

As mentioned above, Eqs. ( 4.31 )–( 4.32 ) are analogues of the
“next-order” consistency equations for the tensor tilt, @xmath [cf. Eqs.
(5.6)–(5.7) of Lidsey et al. [ 106 ] ]. If the @xmath cannot be
determined with sufficient accuracy to test these equations, we can
obtain a simpler set of “lowest-order” relations obtained by
systematically neglecting next-order terms in the slow-roll
approximation. This entails assuming @xmath in Eq. ( 4.33 ). Together
with ( 4.31 )–( 4.32 ), Eq. ( 4.33 ) then implies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

Even more simply, Eq. ( 4.34 ) requires @xmath and @xmath to have the
same sign, and @xmath to have the opposite sign. By consulting the
individual expressions for the @xmath , it follows that @xmath and
@xmath must be negative, but @xmath should be positive whenever @xmath
is moderately large. This more primitive test of the consistency
relations is applicable even if the @xmath cannot be determined
accurately. In the present framework, it is a manifestation of the
well-known result that the DBI model produces @xmath , whereas WMAP data
favour @xmath . For this reason, present-day observations are already
sufficient to disfavour DBI inflation.

We note that Eq. ( 4.34 ), and similar expressions for @xmath with
@xmath , express the expected decrease in amplitude of @xmath with
increasing @xmath . The decrease is not monotonic, because the spikes
which appear in @xmath at larger @xmath cause a small enhancement.
However, the @xmath harmonics are larger than the rest, which is
required by the analysis of § 4.3.1 .

##### Case study: @xmath-inflation

For comparison, consider the power-law @xmath -inflation model of
Armendáriz-Picón, Darmour & Mukhanov [ 26 ] , which we discussed in §
3.4.1 . The action for this model satisfies

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.35)
  -- -- -- --------

It admits an inflationary solution for @xmath provided @xmath ,
unrelated to the Lorentz factor in the DBI model. In the limit @xmath ,
and keeping only leading-order terms, this model predicts

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

Comparison with Eq. ( 4.34 ) for the DBI consistency relations shows
that it would be necessary to measure @xmath to about @xmath in order to
distinguish these models. A sufficiently accurate measurement of @xmath
would make the test considerably easier to apply. Just like for DBI,
@xmath is also negative for @xmath -inflation.

This method is closely related to a trispectrum-based test for
single-field inflation proposed by Smidt et al. [ 53 ] . The trispectrum
contains contributions from two different ‘ local ’ shapes, with
amplitudes parametrized by @xmath and @xmath [ 205 , 206 , 207 ] . The
@xmath contribution obeys the Suyama–Yamaguchi inequality @xmath [ 208 ,
209 ] , where the equality applies to single-source models. Smidt et al.
suggested studying @xmath , which is analogous to the ratios @xmath
introduced above. Their analysis suggested that Planck may be able to
measure @xmath to @xmath at @xmath , and a future CMB satellite may even
be able to achieve @xmath with the same significance. An accurate
measurement of @xmath would be sufficient to rule out single-field
scenarios.

In summary, like the well-known standard inflationary consistency
relations, whether relations such as Eqs. ( 4.31 )–( 4.34 ) and Eq. (
4.36 ) are useful in practice will depend on the accuracy with which
each component can be measured. This depends on the signal-to-noise
associated with each harmonic shape. However, the method we have
described can be implemented with any suitable basis; it is not
restricted to the @xmath functions described above. Nevertheless, our
choice of @xmath makes it transparent that one can think about the
templates used in the CMB analysis arising as the first harmonics. After
applying the orthogonalisation procedure, a shape given by higher-order
harmonics emerges as a result.

### 4.4 Summary of results

In this chapter we have explored the scale and shape-dependences of the
bispectrum in single-field inflation models. Our main findings are
summarised as follows.

#### “New” bispectrum shapes

Our results capture the shape-dependence of the bispectrum even in the
squeezed limit. Therefore, we are able to fully determine the
relationship between the leading and next-order shapes in the slow-roll
approximation, discussed in § 4.2 .

Working in a @xmath model, the enhanced part of the leading-order
bispectrum is well-known to correlate with the equilateral template.
Only two shapes are available, plotted in Table 4.9 , and the bispectrum
is a linear combination of these. If enough fine-tuning is allowed, one
is able to produce a distinctive shape, at leading-order, which does not
correlate with the typical templates used in CMB analysis. This shape is
very similar to a ‘new’ shape constructed by Creminelli et al. [ 11 ] ,
working in an entirely different model—a galilean shift-invariant
Lagrangian with at least two derivatives applied to the field.

The next-order bispectrum is a linear combination of seven different
shapes, although these cannot be varied independently: strong
correlations among their coefficients are imposed by the @xmath
Lagrangian. Many of these shapes also correlate with the equilateral
mode, but two of them are different: in the language of § 4.2 , these
are @xmath and @xmath . For typical values of @xmath (which is the
@xmath -enhanced part of @xmath ), one can obtain a linear combination
of the next-order shapes orthogonal to both lowest-order shapes. This is
the orthogonal shape @xmath in Table 4.12 .

We conclude that provided we are willing to tolerate a large fine-tuning
of the coefficients @xmath (or a large overall amplitude of the
primordial bispectrum), this ‘new’-shape can always be produced in the
bispectrum of any single-field theory. Therefore, the presence of this
shape cannot be used as a diagnostic tool to support a specific model.
This suggests performing a different kind of analysis to the bispectrum
shapes.

#### Insights from the modal decomposition

Motivated by the recurrent presence of the shape with drumlin features,
we have turned in § 4.3 to the modal decomposition of the CMB
bispectrum, originally proposed by Fergusson & Shellard [ 9 , 201 ] .
The decomposition into fundamental harmonics is naturally designed to
study correlations among the amplitudes of shapes which are present in
the primordial bispectrum. A given Lagrangian will typically generate
fluctuations which depend on a finite number of parameters. If enough
modes of the bispectrum can be determined with sufficient accuracy,
these parameters can be written in terms of observable quantities.
Further observations then constitute tests of a particular theory, and
can ultimately allow us to reduce the number of competing inflationary
models.

As an illustration, we have applied our method to DBI inflation with an
arbitrary potential and warp factor. We compared the resulting
consistency relations with the ones obtained in the @xmath -inflation
scenario. With sufficiently accurate observations it may be possible to
distinguish these models. Similar tests can be devised for any
single-field inflationary model.

For an arbitrary Horndeski model, only five measurements of the
correlations between the primordial bispectrum and the (first five)
fundamental harmonics are required to know the coefficients @xmath .
Further measurements break the degeneracy amongst the dynamical
quantities from which each @xmath is built, and also allow us to test
the theory against observations.

## Chapter 5 Inflationary Signatures of Single-Field Models Beyond
Slow-Roll

As we have seen in the previous two chapters, until recently to compute
the bispectrum we started from the action for the comoving curvature
perturbation, @xmath , for each model independently. However, recent
developments have taught us that, in single-field models without
ghost-like instabilities, the cubic action for @xmath can always be
written in the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

The model-dependent imprints are encoded in each of the five
coefficients @xmath of the Horndeski operators. This action will be our
starting point to compute the bispectrum in this chapter.

Many authors have focused on the study of the action ( 5.1 ) under the
assumption of slow-roll regime in which the inflationary expansion is
quasi-de Sitter, whilst allowing for a small variation of the sound
speed of perturbations. In this approximation, @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath all obey @xmath . Examples of such works include Refs. [ 88 , 45
, 28 ] , and the calculation introduced in chapter 2 . But, what if
inflation was not very close to de Sitter, and these parameters cannot
be treated perturbatively? Khoury & Piazza [ 174 ] showed that this
scenario was still compatible with a perfectly scale-invariant spectrum
of perturbations, in fair agreement with observations [ 7 ] , provided
the relation @xmath was satisfied in @xmath models. ¹ ¹ 1 These authors
have also considered solutions within the ekpyrotic mechanism (see Ref.
[ 210 ] for a review, and also Refs. [ 211 , 212 ] ). Here, however, we
focus on the inflationary scenario.

We know that both @xmath and | @xmath | must be small to allow for a
successful period of inflation. But how small are they required to be?
If @xmath is not much smaller than @xmath , then a calculation beyond
slow-roll is technically required, especially to fit in the current era
of precision cosmology. Previous works which have attempted to study
correlations beyond the slow-roll regime include corrections to the
power spectrum in canonical models worked out by Steward & Lyth [ 102 ]
; moreover, Gong & Stewart [ 104 ] (see also Ref. [ 129 ] ) used the
Green’s function method to obtain the propagator of scalar fluctuations
to next-next-order in slow-roll. This terminology has been explained in
§ 2.1.2 . This was later generalised by Wei et al. [ 107 ] who
considered models with a varying speed of sound of perturbations.
Additionally Bartolo et al. [ 213 ] calculated the power spectrum beyond
leading-order in the context of effective field theories of inflation [
125 , 214 ] .

In this chapter we will be interested in models where the spectrum is
almost scale-invariant, so that the condition found by Khoury & Piazza
is mildly broken, and becomes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This requires working to all orders in @xmath and @xmath , but
perturbatively in @xmath , in deviations of the spectral index from
unity, @xmath , and time variations of @xmath and @xmath . This last
assumption ensures that the conditions @xmath are preserved for a
sufficiently large number of e-folds, which is a primary requisite for
inflation to last at least @xmath e-folds. ² ² 2 This work explicitly
excludes models with features in the potentials, which can trigger the
slow-roll parameters to temporarily grow during inflation (see, for
example, the review by Chen [ 203 ] ). In this sense, this is a
calculation beyond the slow-roll approximation, which works as a
resummation technique applied to the non-perturbative parameters @xmath
and @xmath . We refer to it as scale-invariant approximation . Starting
from the action ( 5.1 ), the calculation is immediately applicable to
all Horndeski models. For this reason we will work with arbitrary
interaction coefficients @xmath —assignments to these coefficients will
correspond to specific models.

We organise the calculation in increasing powers in the hierarchy of
slow-variation parameters, focusing on leading and next-order
contributions. Leading-order results involve the least power of
perturbative parameters, and correspond to results obtained assuming a
perfectly scale-invariant spectrum of perturbations. Next-order
corrections contain small deviations from this which are parametrised by
@xmath , and therefore involve terms with one extra power in the
perturbative parameters. This organisational scheme follows the one used
throughout Refs. [ 28 , 1 , 45 ] and the previous chapter, which
nevertheless applied to the slow-roll approximation. On the other hand,
our calculation relies on the scale-invariant approximation and
generalises their results up to next-order in scale-invariance.

Outline .—This chapter is organised as follows. In § 5.1 we obtain the
dynamical behaviour of the scale factor and the other relevant
background quantities in the scale-invariant approximation. The
dynamical behaviour is exact in @xmath and @xmath , and perturbative in
the time variation of these parameters, @xmath and @xmath . In § 5.1.1
we obtain the power spectrum for scalar fluctuations, and we derive in §
5.1.2 formulae for the elementary wavefunctions from which the scalar
propagator is built to next-order in scale-invariance.

We use these results to compute the bispectrum of perturbations in § 5.2
and comment on the differences when using the slow-roll approximation.
We conclude in § 5.3 . Appendix B collects useful formulae and detailed
expressions of recurring integrals necessary to produce closed form
bispectra. Some of these are strongly related to those investigated in
Appendix A . However, for completeness, and because (as we shall see)
these integrals are performed in a different time variable, we include
them in Appendix B as well.

This chapter is strongly based on Ref. [ 3 ] .

### 5.1 Background evolution beyond exact scale-invariance

We are interested in nearly scale-invariant models which fall under the
class of Horndeski theories. As argued in Ref. [ 174 ] a scale-invariant
spectrum for perturbations can be accommodated by a background where
both the Hubble parameter and the speed of sound of perturbations vary
significantly in time, provided they obey the exact relation @xmath .

We start with an arbitrary single-field theory for a homogeneous scalar
field, on which small, inhomogeneous perturbations, @xmath , develop.
All we require is the spectrum of perturbations to be quasi
scale-invariant. For all inflation models involving one single clock in
the universe, the quadratic action for the primordial comoving
perturbation, @xmath , can be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is required to be a well defined, differentiable function
of the background dynamics and Lagrangian parameters, but is otherwise
arbitrary. ³ ³ 3 For @xmath models, @xmath [ 1 ] , but the same need not
be true for other models, such as galileon inflation theories [ 28 ] .
We will come back to this point in § 5.1.2 . We note that @xmath here is
not the usual @xmath for @xmath -inflation defined in Ref. [ 86 ] . We
have seen this action before in Eq. ( 2.15 ). The time evolution of
@xmath will be parametrised by @xmath . For consistency, we also work to
all orders in @xmath . For an arbitrary @xmath , Khoury & Piazza’s
relation between @xmath and @xmath required for scale-invariance, is
generalised to ⁴ ⁴ 4 We refer the reader to Eq. ( B.5 ) in appendix B.2
for details on the derivation of this formula.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This formula reduces to @xmath for @xmath models. As we discuss in
Appendix B.1 , it is more convenient to study the dynamics of background
quantities as a function of @xmath , satisfying @xmath , rather than
conformal time, @xmath . In this new time-coordinate, the action ( 5.2 )
becomes

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath . Introducing the canonically normalised field @xmath ,
where the subscript @xmath specifies the Fourier mode, and changing
variables to @xmath , we find that the modes @xmath obey a Bessel
equation of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The solution to this equation is a linear combination of Hankel
functions, @xmath and @xmath , with order

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For a perfectly scale-invariant spectrum of perturbations, then @xmath
and the spectral index is unity. This results in the power being
constant in all scales. We refer the reader to Appendix B.2 for details
of how the spectral index relates to the background quantities, although
the precise formula will be unimportant in what follows, as we shall
see.

Agreement with the appropriate normalization of the propagator gives the
overall evolution of the elementary wavefunction as follows

  -- -- -- -------
           (5.4)
  -- -- -- -------

Finally, the power spectrum of perturbations can be obtained by
evaluating the scalar propagator at equal times [cf. Eq. ( 2.24 )],
yielding

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

To further simplify this expression we will require the evolution of the
scale factor @xmath in @xmath -coordinates. In order to do so, we
specify the parameters in the slow-variation catalogue, which will allow
us to perform a uniform expansion up to next-order terms in the
scale-invariant approximation.

Slow-variation catalogue .—To obtain the dynamical evolution of the
scale factor in a background where @xmath and @xmath are smaller than
@xmath (but not necessarily much smaller than @xmath ), we introduce the
following slow-variation parameters:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

We assume these parameters satisfy @xmath . Our results rely on the
scale-invariant expansion, and are organised in leading-order
contributions, and terms contributing at next-order only. Leading-order
results are the lowest-order terms which are compatible with a perfectly
scale-invariant power spectrum of perturbations, whereas next-order
terms are corrections parametrising the deviation from @xmath . This
organisational scheme is motivated by the cosmological data that
suggests that @xmath is very small, and can therefore be treated
perturbatively.

To determine the behaviour of the scale factor, we start by integrating
@xmath to compute @xmath . Working perturbatively in @xmath and @xmath ,
but to all orders in @xmath and @xmath , we find

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

These sums converge and give

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

This result was first obtained by Khoury & Piazza in Ref. [ 174 ] .
Using Eq. ( 5.7 ) we can further simplify the two-point correlator ( 5.5
) in @xmath -time, which becomes

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

In a generic model, the two-point correlator will evolve in time.
However, for a single-field model, by virtue of conservation of @xmath
on super-horizon scales [ 59 , 48 ] , it follows that the power spectrum
will rapidly converge to its asymptotic value. ⁵ ⁵ 5 See Ref. [ 215 ]
for comments on the number of e-folds necessary for such asymptotic
behaviour to be reached after horizon crossing. There, the authors
studied a two-field inflation model, but the same conclusions apply to
single-field models. We have also seen this explicitly in § 2.2.2 .

Therefore, we can focus our calculation a few e-folds after horizon
crossing for a given scale, @xmath . This has become the standard
approach when calculating the asymptotic limit of the power spectrum.
This remains true even in multi-field inflation, where this procedure
sets the appropriate initial conditions for evolving correlation
functions after horizon crossing, using techniques such as @xmath [ 57 ]
, transport equations [ 138 , 139 ] , or transfer matrices [ 216 ] (see,
for example, Refs. [ 217 , 218 , 219 , 140 , 220 , 221 ] ). The
advantages of applying this approach are twofold: on one hand, at this
point in the evolution the elementary wavefunction is completely
characterised by the growing mode, since the decaying mode has become
negligible; on the other hand, the power spectrum obtained in this way
is already the asymptotic value, at late times. Said differently, at
this point of evaluation @xmath has become classical [ 59 , 222 ] .

With this methodology in mind, and working perturbatively in @xmath and
@xmath we obtain

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.9a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.9b)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

to next-order in the scale-invariant approximation. As before, starred
quantities are to be evaluated when some scale, @xmath , has exited the
@xmath -horizon, so that @xmath . It is important to leave this scale
arbitrary since this generates the scale-dependence of the correlation
functions. The appearance of the logarithmic term corresponds precisely
to the number of e-folds, @xmath , measured in @xmath -coordinates,
which have elapsed since the scale @xmath has exited the horizon. The
expansion in Eqs. ( 5.9 ) is only valid up to a few e-folds outside the
horizon, when one can trust the expansion in Taylor series to
first-order. We note that quasi scale-invariance demands @xmath , up to
next-next-order corrections, which we do not keep in our calculation.

Given the individual dynamics of @xmath and @xmath derived in Eqs. (
B.11 ) and ( B.13 ) of Appendix B.3 , we can replace for the evolution
of the scale factor in Eq. ( 5.7 ). We find:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the next-order parameters @xmath and @xmath are defined in Eqs. (
B.10 ). ⁶ ⁶ 6 @xmath and @xmath here are not to be confused with the
parameters refereed to by the same letters in the previous chapters.
Despite its complicated structure, Eq. ( 5.10 ) correctly reproduces the
results of chapter 2 and Ref. [ 174 ] when we take the limit of exact
scale-invariance, for which @xmath , resulting in vanishing @xmath and
@xmath [cf. Eqs. ( B.10 )]. The extra terms in between brackets in Eq. (
5.10 ) are precisely the corrections to a pure, dominant power-law
evolution.

#### 5.1.1 The scalar power spectrum

The power spectrum @xmath defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath , will in general depend on time. Taking the super-horizon
limit, @xmath , we find that the dominant contribution arising from the
Hankel function in Eq. ( 5.8 ) is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Whatever @xmath -evolution the remaining terms in Eq. ( 5.8 ) have in
this limit, they should precisely cancel the @xmath -dependence of the
Hankel function. This is a requirement imposed by conservation of @xmath
on super-horizon scales in single-field models. This allows us to
readily write the power spectrum as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have defined

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is the power spectrum for a nearly scale-invariant Horndeski
theory. To recover the perfectly scale-invariant formula obtained by
Khoury & Piazza [ 174 ] , we simply set @xmath and @xmath to zero, since
these enter the power spectrum as next-order corrections in
scale-invariance. Whilst being time-independent, Eq. ( 5.12 ) correctly
reproduces the expected logarithmic scale-dependence in the limit when
the slow-roll regime applies, in which @xmath and @xmath are slow-roll
parameters [cf. Eq. ( 2.25 )]. Indeed, we can check that defining the
dimensionless version of the power spectrum using the usual rule @xmath
, Eq. ( 5.12 ) gives

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Again, the explicit expression for @xmath will not be required in any
stage of the calculation, but we refer the reader to Appendix B.2 where
its formula is derived. It suffices to treat it as an arbitrary
next-order quantity.

#### 5.1.2 Obtaining next-order corrections to the wavefunctions, @xmath

Our ultimate interest lies in obtaining the bispectrum of perturbations
starting from the action ( 5.1 ). We will rely on the scale-invariant
approximation introduced in this chapter. Since we will keep corrections
up to next-order, we also require corrections to the elementary
wavefunctions up to the same order, for consistency. We have already
explained them in detail in § 3.1.1 , but we enumerate them here for
completeness.

External legs .—The corrections to the external lines of the Feynman
diagram correspond to evaluating the propagator in the asymptotic
regime, when @xmath . From Eq. ( 5.12 ) we can read off the corrections
to the external legs

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

As argued in § 5.1.1 , the time-independence of this is guaranteed
because the primordial perturbation @xmath is conserved on super-horizon
scales in single-field models.

From this it also follows that whatever function is assigned to @xmath ,
it must generically behave, at leading-order in scale-invariance, as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

This imposes a mild requirement on an otherwise arbitrary, but smooth
function @xmath . We check that for @xmath models, where @xmath , this
behaviour is consistent with Eqs. ( 5.9 ) and ( B.11 ), supplemented by
the condition @xmath (which holds at leading-order in the
scale-invariant approximation scheme). If in a given model @xmath has a
different evolution from that of Eq. ( 5.15 ), it leads to a background
where @xmath is evolving on super-horizon scales, which is incompatible
with the single-field inflation scenario.

Internal legs .—This correction is a result of the spectrum being
slightly tilted. Using Eq. ( 5.7 ), we rewrite, for clarity, Eq. ( 5.4 )
for the elementary wavefunction as

  -- -- -- --------
           (5.16)
  -- -- -- --------

The order of the Hankel function, @xmath , differs from @xmath by
next-order corrections proportional to @xmath . To evaluate corrections
to @xmath we start by Taylor expanding the Hankel function around order
@xmath . Following Refs. [ 45 , 28 ] , we find the background evolution
of the wavefunctions is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

which gives the leading-order behaviour of Eq. ( 5.14 ) in the limit
@xmath . The next-order corrections arising from @xmath and the
slow-variation of the background quantities in ( 5.16 ) organise
themselves into the internal leg corrections:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

The integral representation on the second line above corresponds to the
exponential integral function, @xmath , defined for real, non-zero
argument

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which was discussed in detail in Appendix A.1 . The time-dependence of
the internal leg corrections is fairly intricate and we verify that
there are no divergences in Eq. ( 5.18 ) when we take the limit @xmath .
This represents a minimal check on this result. Expressions for the
time-derivatives of the wavefunctions can be found in Appendix B.3 .

Corrections arising from evolving interaction vertices .—The interaction
coefficients @xmath can generically evolve very fast, and one expects
their time evolution to be of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

with the power @xmath depending on the exact expression of @xmath , and
@xmath and @xmath being next-order terms in the scale-invariant
approximation. This power-law dependence needs to be taken into account
for consistency with the scale-invariant approximation—we will study an
explicit example in § 5.2.2 . There, we explain in detail that the
behaviour in Eq. ( 5.19 ) can potentially bring problems to the
convergence of the integral in the formula for the bispectrum. In
particular, there might be values of @xmath for which one is unable to
perform the calculation, because they would lead to a time-dependent
three-point function.

Mainly to simplify our results, we assume the interaction vertices to
have a very smooth and slow evolution in @xmath -time. To this end, we
introduce a supplementary slow-variation parameter

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

which satisfies @xmath . We expect this approximation to be valid for
all Horndeski models whenever the interaction vertices are slowly
evolving in time. As described in § 5.2.2 , the methods developed in
this chapter can still be used to compute @xmath -point correlation
functions in models where this assumption fails. We conclude that, if
@xmath is slowly varying, then each interaction vertex evolves as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

This means that for simplicity in the remainder of this chapter we will
set @xmath and @xmath in Eq. ( 5.19 ), but we will show how to deal with
@xmath in one simple example in § 5.2.2 . This assumption concludes the
presentation of the slow-variation catalogue, which is therefore
composed by the set @xmath .

Simplifying our results .—We note that a further simplification to the
background dynamics follows from inspection of Eqs. ( 5.14 ) and ( 5.18
). The variable @xmath that parametrises the variation of @xmath , does
not appear in our formulae. Indeed such term is only present implicitly
since it is encapsulated in the spectral index @xmath [cf. Eq. ( B.5 )].
Therefore the calculation is explicitly independent of our choice of
@xmath As a consequence, we can effectively reduce the relation we found
between @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , to one which only involves the
first two variables. To this end, we take the relation between @xmath
and @xmath to be

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is a next-order parameter in the scale-invariant
approximation. We emphasize that this procedure in no way lacks
generality: the calculation is still non-perturbative in both @xmath and
@xmath . The formula above generalises the regime studied in Ref. [ 174
] by considering a nearly scale-invariant spectrum. This also implies
that @xmath at next-order in the scale-invariant approximation, which is
in agreement with the observations in § 5.1 .

This procedure dramatically simplifies our formulae and reduces the
slow-variation catalogue to a minimum of parameters, which we choose to
be @xmath . At the same time, our results will be displayed in terms of
only one non-perturbative parameter, which we choose to be @xmath . ⁷ ⁷
7 Our calculation is non-perturbative in both @xmath and @xmath . By
noting that we can write @xmath , we can replace the non-perturbative
parameter @xmath by the perturbative parameter @xmath . In the remainder
of the text, the dependence in @xmath is absorbed by @xmath . We note
that this will imply some conceptual restructuring of our formulae. In
particular, Eq. ( 5.17 ) now contains leading and next-order
contributions in @xmath , which can now be interpreted as an extra
contribution to the external legs at next-order in Eq. ( 5.14 ).

Eqs. ( 5.14 ), ( 5.18 ), and ( 5.21 ) combine amongst themselves to
produce the overall corrections required to write the bispectrum at
next-order in the scale-invariant approximation. They naturally combine
to produce two separate contributions to the bispectrum: the background
contributions and next-order corrections arising from the vertex and
external legs; and the next-order contributions arising from the
internal legs of the Feynman diagram. We will use this way of
partitioning the bispectrum to present our results for the bispectrum in
§ 5.2.1 by labelling the first contributions as type- @xmath bispectrum
, and the second as type- @xmath bispectrum . This is the same notation
defined in § 3.2.1 .

### 5.2 Non-gaussianity in the bispectrum

As we have seen in the last chapters, non-gaussian signatures encoded in
the CMBR work as a powerful discriminant between inflationary models. We
compute the bispectrum in nearly scale-invariant theories using the same
in-in rules reviewed in § 2.3.2 . The study of shapes is, however,
beyond the scope of this work, and we leave it to forthcoming
investigation. We illustrate our results by specifying estimates of
@xmath in some useful limits.

#### 5.2.1 Bispectrum of Horndeski theories

As argued before, it will be convenient to write the action for
perturbations in @xmath -coordinates. From Eq. ( 5.1 ) this is given by

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (5.22)
                          
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Our calculation is organised as follows:

Bispectrum type @xmath .—The leading contributions and the corrections
arising from the slow-variation of the interaction vertices and external
legs can be written in the general form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the addition of cyclic permutations entails the symmetric exchange
of momenta @xmath . The functions @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
are listed in table 5.1 . The functions @xmath are studied in Appendix
B.4 and defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

Table 5.2 contains the assignments @xmath , @xmath and @xmath for the
functions @xmath . We note that the coefficients for the operators
@xmath , @xmath , and @xmath are the same. Having done the calculation
independently for each operator, this is a minimal check of the
correctness of our results. This happens because these operators have
the same time-derivative structure, and differ only in the arrangement
of spatial-derivatives, and therefore, in the momentum dependence.

Bispectrum type @xmath .—Likewise, the contributions from the propagator
in the internal lines of the Feynman diagram can be consolidated for all
operators in the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

where again the addition of cyclic permutations entails the symmetric
exchange of momenta @xmath . The functions @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath are listed in tables 5.3 , 5.4 and 5.5 .
Table 5.6 contains the assignments @xmath , @xmath and @xmath for the
functions @xmath . The functions @xmath are defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . We refer the reader to Appendix B.4 for details on the
evaluation of these functions.

#### 5.2.2 Features of the bispectrum of Horndeski theories

These results extend those obtained assuming a slow-roll inflationary
phase in the early universe. We now comment on our results.

Enhancement of non-gaussinities .—It is apparent from our formulae that
the enhancement of the bispectrum can be very different from the one
found in models using the slow-roll approximation. This strictly depends
on the expressions for the coefficients @xmath . As observed in Ref. [
28 ] , if the interaction vertices in the action ( 5.1 ) do not contain
enough powers in the speed of sound, then the overall dependence in
@xmath could be stronger than that commonly associated with DBI models
@xmath . Depending on @xmath , there might exist models that reproduce
such behaviour. To gauge whether this scenario would be permissible
could involve applying the partial wave decomposition method to the
Horndeski overall bispectrum shape, described in § 4.2 . Five
measurements would be required to fix each of the @xmath interactions,
and a number of additional measurements to break the degeneracy in other
parameters in @xmath , such as @xmath and @xmath . Ultimately this would
allow us to place constraints on all the parameters of the theory. Only
then would we be able to conclude whether there is enhancement of
non-gaussianities in these models.

Logarithms .—Our formulae contain logarithms of momenta encoded, for
example, in the master integral @xmath (defined in Eq. ( B.23 ) of
Appendix B.4 ). There are two varieties of logarithms as noted in § 3.2
: those which depend on the reference scale, @xmath , and those which
depend on the perimeter momentum scale, @xmath . The first type of
logarithms are clearly of the same nature as the ones identified in the
power spectrum ( 5.12 ): they encode the scale-dependence of the
bispectrum. One can choose the reference scale, @xmath , so as to
minimise these logarithms; alternatively, one can use this degree of
freedom to measure primordial non-gaussianities on different scales. The
last type of logarithms are responsible for the shape-dependence of the
bispectrum.

Away from slow-roll .—If the inflationary background is almost de
Sitter, so that @xmath , it is easy to see that the power-law behaviour
@xmath (seen in table 5.1 ), where @xmath is some integer, can be
written as a next-order logarithmic correction. This can be checked by
taking the limit of very small @xmath in the Taylor series expansion and
comparing our results to § 3.2.1 . Away from the slow-roll regime, the
dependence on the reference scale, @xmath , arises from power-laws
(whose Taylor expansion we cannot truncate) in addition to logarithmic
contributions. For comparison, let us write the formula of the
bispectrum type-a for one operator, say @xmath , which we shall call
@xmath . We find that:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath and @xmath . This expression shows an unusual power-law
dependence on the reference scale, @xmath , which is absent from
previous studies, where only the logarithmic contributions @xmath were
known [ 1 ] . By keeping the reference scale @xmath arbitrary in our
calculation, the scale-dependence of the bispectrum can be calculated.
This will include the contribution of the power-law scaling as @xmath ,
which could receive large corrections from @xmath . In Ref. [ 174 ]
Khoury & Piazza chose @xmath , which masks the power-law effect.

Considering a slow-roll expansion, by which we take @xmath to be a
slow-roll parameter [treating it on equal footing as @xmath and @xmath
], Eq. ( 5.27 ) simplifies to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

which resembles the bispectrum obtained in § 3.2.1 . ⁸ ⁸ 8 To be more
precise, we can indeed show that our results for the overall bispectrum
agree (adding type a and type b bispectrum), including the explicit
dependence on the reference scale, @xmath . We note that in Eq. ( 5.28 )
the dependence on @xmath appears through logarithms, and the power-law
behaviour has explicitly disappeared from the result. As advertised, by
taking @xmath to be a small parameter, the power-law is well described,
at next-order in the slow-roll approximation, by a logarithmic
contribution. The reference scale, @xmath , appears in the form of two
logarithmic functions: @xmath and @xmath . These species of logarithms
were thoroughly studied in § 3.2.1 , to which we refer the reader for
details. It is in this sense that our work generalises the calculations
which have been performed assuming the slow-roll approximation.

The behaviour described above shows that whereas the power spectrum has
a universal weak logarithmic scale-dependence [cf. Eq. ( 5.12 )], the
bispectrum of these theories beyond the slow-roll regime can have a much
stronger scale-dependence. In principle, this could be used as a
diagnostic tool from CMB ( @xmath ) to cluster scales ( @xmath ),
interpolating with scales probed by the galaxy bispectrum.

A number of authors have studied constraints on non-gaussianity arising
from galaxy surveys [ 223 , 52 ] , including its relation with biasing [
50 ] . The scale-dependence of the bispectrum was initially studied by
Chen in an infrared model of DBI inflation [ 183 ] , and later
investigated in @xmath models (a subset of the Horndeski class) by
LoVerde et al. [ 197 ] . It is not the aim of this chapter to present a
detailed analysis of the scale-dependence of the bispectrum. We rather
want to offer an explicit example of theories which inherit a strong
scale-dependence from the background dynamics.

#### Comparison with previous results

Khoury & Piazza .—Khoury & Piazza [ 174 ] calculated the bispectrum of
@xmath theories in an exactly scale-invariant background, in which
@xmath . In this chapter we have extended this study in two ways: by
performing the calculation perturbatively away from exact
scale-invariance, as supported by observations, and applying it to the
Horndeski class of models.

In particular, let us take a specific example for comparison. Focusing
on the operator @xmath and in the action studied by Khoury & Piazza, we
take

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We note that @xmath is rapidly varying in time and should therefore be
placed inside the integral to compute the bispectrum, which we denote by
@xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the factor @xmath comes from the two time-derivatives of the
wavefunctions and the last one (between brackets) from the
undifferentiated wavefunction. For comparison purposes, we only retain
the contributions at leading-order in scale-invariance, which means
setting all the next-order corrections we have carefully kept track in
this chapter to zero.

Therefore, selecting only the leading-order contribution in Eq. ( 5.23
), we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have retained the scale-dependence through @xmath . This
formula reproduces the results of Ref. [ 174 ] provided we choose the
reference scale to satisfy @xmath . Eq. ( 5.30 ) is the bispectrum of
the operator @xmath for a perfectly scale-invariant spectrum of
perturbations.

Whenever comparison was possible our results reproduce those of Ref. [
174 ] .

Noller & Magueijo .—Second, in Ref. [ 187 ] Noller & Magueijo estimated
the magnitude of the next-order corrections to the bispectrum in the
scale-invariant approximation of @xmath models. In comparison, our
calculation extends to the larger Horndeski scalar field theories. Their
estimate focused on a subset of next-order corrections important when
@xmath .

However, as we pointed out in § 3.4.1 , there are other contributions
which contribute equally to the bispectrum and are sensitive to the
dynamics around horizon crossing, when the approximation @xmath fails.
As we have shown, these corrections can be obtained by evaluating the
change in the Hankel function of order @xmath , rather than at the exact
scale-invariant choice, @xmath . If these contributions are not taken
into account then the details of the interference between growing and
decaying modes around horizon-crossing are lost. As we have argued in
the previous chapters, these details are very important for our results
to obey Maldacena’s consistency condition.

Moreover, in our calculation we have performed a uniform expansion to
next-order corrections in the scale-invariant approximation. In
particular we used Eq. ( 5.10 ) for the scale factor, @xmath , and Eq. (
B.11 ) for @xmath . Ref. [ 187 ] on the other hand assumed a perfectly
scale-invariant background, on top of which perturbations would develop.
This amounts to setting @xmath in our Eq. ( 5.10 ), even though their
contribution is as important as terms linear in @xmath —as we have
previously argued, the scalar fluctuations are sensitive to the
background dynamics, and in particular to the next-order corrections we
have calculated in the scale-invariant approximation.

For completeness, we will investigate one particular limit in @xmath
theories (these include DBI inflation) studied in Ref. [ 187 ] , when
the speed of sound of fluctuations is small, @xmath . This regime is
phenomenologically interesting since it is known to be related with
large non-gaussianities [ 74 ] , for which the dominant operator is
@xmath . To make this application more explicit we apply the notation of
§ 5.2.1 , and also Refs. [ 1 , 45 ] ), and take the action

  -- -- -- --------
           (5.31)
  -- -- -- --------

with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We assume @xmath is constant. In DBI models, @xmath and therefore one
sees that we cannot require @xmath to be constant given that we are
interested precisely in the regime when @xmath is rapidly varying.
However, for the purposes of making this comparison more transparent, we
assume this is the case, similarly to what was done in Refs. [ 174 , 187
, 1 ] , and implemented in § 3.4.1 . Technically, a more precise
estimate would have to take the time-dependence of @xmath into account.

We can see that taking the limit of small @xmath , corresponds to
considering @xmath , in which case the interaction vertex is well
approximated by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Inspection of this formula reveals that this interaction vertex is
rapidly varying, by virtue of its time-dependence in @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath , of which only @xmath is slowly varying.

Our formulae are easily adapted to the case of rapidly varying @xmath .
For @xmath we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

up to next-order corrections in scale-invariance. These corrections can
be absorbed into the coefficients @xmath , @xmath and @xmath in table
5.2 . This generalises Eq. ( 5.21 ) to rapidly varying interaction
vertices. Since ( 5.32 ) adds power-law contributions to the integral in
Eq. ( 5.31 ), one might worry that not all the previously allowed values
of @xmath will make the final result converge—we recall that the overall
power-law needs to decay faster than @xmath for convergence criteria to
be met. In the event this does not happen then one is required to
perform integration by parts an appropriate number of times to isolate
the primitively divergent contributions, in a completely analogous way
as we have dealt with the operator @xmath in § 3.2.1 . A convergent
answer should similarly place constraints on the allowed values of
@xmath so that the correlators do not evolve in time, since this could
signal a spurious divergence.

Nevertheless, for this operator the integral ( B.23 ) is evaluated for
@xmath and is therefore always convergent, since the condition @xmath is
satisfied for all the range of @xmath . The calculation is carried out
as described in § 5.2.1 . Using the definition of @xmath ( 3.2 ), we
find that at leading-order in scale-invariance

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a non-negative constant. @xmath can change sign if
@xmath , when the argument of the trigonometric function changes from
the first to the second quadrant. This would be important since WMAP
constraints predict predominantly positive values for @xmath , whereas
the original DBI model, under the slow-roll approximation, gives
negative @xmath .

Including the next-order corrections, the result becomes substantially
more complicated and in an attempt to simplify it as much as possible,
we evaluate @xmath in the equilateral limit and when @xmath . We
organise the correction to the leading-order non-gaussianity, @xmath ,
in terms proportional to the various slow-variation parameters, as
follows:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

with

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (5.35a)
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
                          (5.35b)
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (5.35c)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath . We note the dependence on the power-law in @xmath ,
expected whenever the slow-roll approximation breaks down. The polygamma
functions of order zero, @xmath , were introduced in Eq. ( B.20 ) in
Appendix B.4 . @xmath denotes the @xmath -harmonic number which relates
to @xmath via @xmath , and @xmath satisfies

  -- -------- --
     @xmath

using the results from Appendix B.4 . Eq. ( 5.34 ) contains all the
next-order contributions in the scale-invariant approximation. Eqs. (
5.33 ) and ( 5.34 ) are to be compared to Eq. (3.15) of Ref. [ 187 ] .

As argued in chapter 3 , there is no reason to believe these corrections
will be negligible, but their magnitude will depend on the values of the
parameters @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath . We do not attempt to
produce an order of magnitude of these corrections here. We also notice
that the dependence on the scale @xmath vanishes in the slow-roll limit,
when @xmath becomes a perturbative parameter, @xmath . This observation
is in line with our previous comments on the strong scale-dependence
whenever there was an appreciable deviation from the slow-roll regime,
and the scale-invariant approach became valid.

With this example, it becomes clear that the scale-invariant
approximation allows resummation of all powers of @xmath and @xmath in
the slow-roll approximation, provided the spectrum of perturbations is
nearly scale-invariant.

Burrage et al. .—Finally, as previously discussed, our results extend
what was obtained by Burrage et al. [ 1 ] (on which our chapters 2 and 3
are based), and also Chen et al. [ 45 ] who treated the variation of the
speed of sound of scalar fluctuations, @xmath , and the expansion rate,
@xmath , as slowly varying in the @xmath class of models. Taking the
limit of small @xmath and restoring @xmath in our formulae by setting
@xmath , we find perfect agreement between our results to next-order in
slow-roll, including the logarithmic corrections previously discussed.
As emphasised before, these corrections are important to correctly
evaluate the scale-dependence of the bispectrum. Moreover, their
motivation is driven by data and they could contribute to our estimates
of non-gaussianities with a precision level comparable to the
sensitivity of Planck ’s data. As a consequence, our results obey
Maldacena’s factorisation theorem [ 66 , 167 ] in the limit when
slow-roll is a good approximation, which represents a non trivial
consistency check of our calculation. The results presented in §§ 4.1 –
4.2 regarding the scale and shape-dependences of the bispectrum apply to
our analysis if the slow-roll approximation is valid. Whenever there is
significant breaking of the slow-roll approximation, we expect different
results.

### 5.3 Summary of results

Whereas most studies of the bispectrum assume slow-roll conditions,
cosmological constraints still allow for a deviation from this regime,
whilst being compatible with inflation [ 174 ] . In this chapter we
studied the phenomenology of inflationary backgrounds where @xmath , but
are treated non -perturbatively. They are nevertheless combined to
produce an almost scale-invariant spectrum of scalar perturbations.
Under these assumptions, we have calculated the bispectrum for
single-field Horndeski models perturbatively in @xmath , but to all
orders in @xmath and @xmath . We have found that the scale-dependence of
the bispectrum is encapsulated not only in a logarithmic [cf. § 3.2 ],
but in a stronger, power-law form. The power-law behaviour is more
relevant if the breaking from slow-roll is stronger, and the slow-roll
approximation fails.

In an optimistic scenario, such behaviour can be used to constrain the
parameters of a given theory more tightly, and potentially eliminate it
from the list of sensible models against observations. It is quite
likely that with Planck the amount of information one is able to extract
from the CMBR about the early universe will come to an end. It is
therefore important to be able to retain the scale-dependence of the
bispectrum in our theoretical computations and estimations, so as to use
results from the complementary smaller scales (LSS) [ 224 , 225 , 226 ,
227 ] .

We have obtained the general expression for the bispectrum in Horndeski
theories for both constant and rapidly varying interaction coefficients,
@xmath . This work should be regarded as a first step towards estimating
observables on a background that does not obey the slow-roll regime.
Because these theories have a strong scale-dependence, they are more
vulnerable to data constraints arising from different scales.

We leave the study of decomposing bispectrum shapes into fundamental
harmonics (basis shapes) for future work. This partial-wave
decomposition is very important in distinguishing between models as
discussed in Ref. [ 2 ] and throughout chapter 4 . Also, it will be
interesting to derive the consistency relations between the amplitudes
of each harmonic. This could enable us to project out models whose
dynamics is beyond slow-roll, if those relations were not supported by
data. If single field models are excluded by observations, we will have
to embark on a multi-field inflation exploration, where the interplay
between curvature and isocurvature modes can be quite intricate (see,
for example, Refs. [ 200 , 228 , 141 ] ) .

## Chapter 6 Preheating at the End of Inflation

In the first part of this thesis we have focused on the inflationary
imprints on the CMBR. In particular, we have studied the bispectrum in
single-field models both using and discarding the slow-roll
approximation. Our calculation not only reduces the theory-error
associated with previous estimates, but it also makes small steps
towards developing a potentially more appropriate diagnostic tool that
enables telling models apart.

Whatever the microphysical origin of the post-inflationary universe, we
know that the universe was almost empty at the end of inflation, as the
number density in particles was diluted away by the exponential
expansion. We thus find ourselves with two conceptual problems. First,
the inflaton is not observed today. Therefore, some mechanism must have
caused its energy density to dissipate. Second, matter is abundant all
around us. After all, we are made up of particles. So, how was the
universe repopulated after inflation?

To answer these questions, we will discuss the phenomenology of
preheating in a DBI model in this short chapter. It is certainly not
intended to signify a full study of preheating in this model. We rather
want to briefly analyse what are the main differences between preheating
in canonical and non-canonical models. This chapter represents a
departure from our previous programme of investigating non-gaussian
features in the bispectrum. We regard it as a transition from the study
of the early universe during inflation, to the standard Big Bang model.

Outline .—We start by giving a short review of some relevant historical
developments in the theory of preheating in § 6.1 , and briefly revisit
the DBI model § 6.2 . In § 6.3 we discuss a DBI toy model in which
inflation ends as the brane settles to its final position in the warped
background. We show that this model is comparable to chaotic inflation
in a theory with canonical kinetic terms, and discuss the parametric
resonance event.

In § 6.4 we study the stage of perturbative reheating and provide an
estimate for the reheating temperature in models driven by a DBI kinetic
term. We give a summary of our findings in § 6.5 . Additional material
related to this chapter is collected in Appendix C .

This chapter is the result of work done in collaboration with Nazim
Bouatta, Anne-Christine Davis and David Seery, and published as Ref. [ 4
] .

### 6.1 Preheating: development of a theory

In this chapter we are interested in understanding how the universe
could have reheated after a period of DBI inflation. The DBI inflation
model was discussed in § 3.4.1 from the point of view of an effective
field theory. There, the inflaton was a scalar field whose dynamics was
governed by the DBI action. Here, we review DBI from the brane world
perspective, but perform our calculation from the quantum field theory
point of view.

In the proposal set forth by Tong & Silverstein [ 27 ] , and later
elaborated in collaboration with Alishahiha [ 74 ] , the DBI action
describes the low-energy dynamics of a D @xmath -brane moving in a
warped background space-time. D-branes naturally arise in string theory
and are extended objects in space-time where open strings can end—for a
review of their properties see the classic textbook by Johnson [ 229 ] .
Inflation in these models was discussed by Chen [ 182 ] , and inflation
in string cosmology has been reviewed by McAllister & Silverstein [ 230
] .

Reheating in related brane-world models has been studied in Refs. [ 231
, 232 , 233 , 234 , 235 ] . Any inflationary theory needs to be
completed through a reheating phase, which depends strongly on the
details of the preceding inflationary phase as emphasised in Refs. [ 236
, 237 ] . In principle, no two models find the same preheating
phenomenology, by which the universe is repopulated with matter
particles. Preheating is a subtle function of the underlying physics,
probing information which can be regarded as complementary to the
physics of the density fluctuation, studied in part I of this thesis.
For this reason, competing inflationary models exhibit important
differences in their preheating analysis. In particular, in this chapter
we shall explore this process and display the main dissimilarities
between DBI models and those with canonical kinetic terms. Here, the DBI
model is to be regarded as representative of the non-canonical class.

Many authors have contributed to the theory of particle production,
which is now well-developed in light of many authors’ efforts [ 238 ,
239 , 240 , 241 ] . The theory of preheating has been reviewed by
Bassett et al. [ 242 ] ; see also Ref. [ 243 ] . We highlight the review
by Kofman, Linde & Starobinsky [ 244 ] , where a comprehensive study of
preheating and reheating was presented. In perturbative reheating , the
decay rate of inflaton particles into other species of the matter sector
is calculated directly from an @xmath -matrix. The calculation of this
process follows the well-known in-out quantum field theory rules applied
to scattering processes. By virtue of the perturbative nature of this
process, reheating is not particularly efficient in producing a
significant number density of particles.

It was later understood that it was possible that an enhancement of the
perturbative decay described above could occur. This could be understood
as a by-product of the accumulation of several previous decays, leading
to a resonant phase of non -equilibrium production known as preheating .
By this process, inflaton particles see their energy dumped into the
matter sector, which one can interpret as an amplification in particles
occupancy number. This will be the central topic in this chapter.

A different effect, named tachyonic preheating [ 245 , 246 , 247 , 248 ]
, is associated with the end of inflation in certain models, usually
when a spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs. Unlike conventional
preheating, this does not merely convert one species of particle into
another, but (like any tachyonic instability) reflects a preference for
converting one vacuum state into another, by the rapid accumulation and
condensation of particles. This phenomenon happens, for example, in
hybrid inflation models, initially proposed by Linde [ 249 ] . The
delicate dynamics between this two-field inflation model makes
preheating particularly hard to investigate, as documented by Lyth in
Refs. [ 250 , 251 ] .

The general theory of preheating has been systematically applied to
concrete models. In particular this was possible for some versions of
brane inflation, where a careful interpretation was given [ 252 , 253 ]
; see also the review by Sen [ 254 ] . In these models, inflation ends
when the mobile @xmath -brane becomes close to a parallel, fixed
antibrane (a @xmath -brane), allowing open strings stretching between
the @xmath – @xmath pair to form. The inflaton field in these models is
the distance between the two branes. The open string states include a
tachyon mode which develops for sufficiently close branes. This
tachyonic instability is believed to induce fragmentation of the @xmath
-brane into @xmath -branes (which pack together to form the @xmath
-brane). The @xmath fragments efficiently decay into closed string
states, which are enumerated by the Kaluza–Klein (“KK”) modes of
supergravity fields in the warped background. These KK modes
subsequently decay into the species of matter and radiation which build
up the standard model content of our universe [ 253 ] .

In this chapter we shall focus on a much less dramatic version of
post-inflationary dynamics. We work in a model where the @xmath -brane
comes to rest near an edge of its warped background, the “tip of the
throat.” As it settles on its resting-place it undergoes coherent
oscillations, inducing growing, quantum fluctuations which fold and
wrinkle the surface of the brane.

As we mentioned before, our interest lies in the qualitative differences
which emerge between inflation models driven by canonical and
non-canonical kinetic terms [ 255 ] . What is the effect of the extra
non-linearities due to the DBI action on the preheating mechanism? Is
the reheating temperature different? Focusing on the differences between
these two classes of models, we will mostly ignore their similarities.
In particular, we acknowledge the use of perturbation theory in either
case will break down when back-reaction becomes important, at which
point the number density of the recently produced particles needs to be
taken into account [ 241 ] . For this reason, our preheating analysis is
restricted to times before the onset of back-reaction.

### 6.2 DBI dynamics

The DBI model was reviewed in § 3.4.1 , and we revisit it here in a
different perspective: that of branes. In Ref. [ 27 ] Silverstein & Tong
discussed the brane-world scenario where one or more @xmath -branes move
in a warped throat, taken to be a six-dimensional elongated region in a
higher dimensional world-volume. This is usually the AdS throat. Another
possibility exists: the throat can be capped off in the infra-red limit
of the underlying field theory.

A low-energy description of a @xmath -brane travelling in this warped
throat is given by the Dirac--Born--Infeld action ¹ ¹ 1 See, for
example, Refs. [ 256 , 257 , 258 ] for discussions on the DBI action.

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the pull-back of the @xmath -dimensional metric to the
brane world-volume, and @xmath is the Ricci scalar constructed from
@xmath . As usually in brane world scenarios, @xmath acts as a
collective coordinate measuring the radial position of the brane within
the throat, and @xmath is the potential describing how the brane is
attracted towards the bottom of the throat. The warp factor, @xmath , is
in general a function of the radial coordinate. A more precise
interpretation is possible: @xmath measures the tension of the @xmath
-brane, redshifted by the warp factor, giving @xmath canonical dimension
@xmath (we are using units in which @xmath has dimensions @xmath ).

If the throat is exactly anti-de Sitter, the result is a static BPS
state in which the potential @xmath is quartic at lowest-order in the
field, because conformal invariance forbids the existence of a mass
term. If the throat is capped off, then conformal invariance is broken—a
typical example is the Klebanov–Strassler throat [ 259 ] . In this case
we expect a mass term to be generated which receives contributions from
moduli stabilization and bulk fluxes [ 252 , 260 , 261 , 262 , 263 , 264
, 265 ] . In a general compactification, a spectrum of terms will be
generated including a @xmath term which may lead to a phase of
inflexion-point inflation. We assume this term is absent, or forbidden
by a symmetry. Therefore, for small departures from the equilibrium
point for @xmath , the potential attracting the brane towards the
infrared tip of the throat is (to lowest order) quadratic [ 27 ] ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

D-brane inflation with this potential is sometimes referred to as the
“UV model.” A related small-field, IR model due to Chen [ 182 ] takes
@xmath with @xmath dominant—we discussed its non-gaussian features in §
3.4.1 .

As the brane approaches the infrared tip of the throat, @xmath tends
slowly to zero. In this limit @xmath and the square root can be expanded
in powers of @xmath , reproducing the action for a canonically
normalised scalar field with potential @xmath . If, however, the brane
is moving relativistically, then @xmath and the square root in Eq. ( 6.1
) is non-expandable . Said differently, in this case we are forced to
retain an infinite set of non-renormalisable operators involving powers
of @xmath with pre-defined Taylor coefficients, but higher-order
derivative operators do not arise. It is the algebraically special form
of the action through which makes DBI satisfy a non-renormalisation
theorem [ 27 , 175 , 266 , 160 ] against large renormalisations of these
expansion coefficients.

To measure the relative importance of the nonlinear terms induced by the
presence of the square root in the action ( 6.1 ), it is conventional to
define the equivalent of a Lorentz factor for the brane, as in Eq. (
3.19 ), given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

This is a non-analytical function which has a branch-cut in the negative
real axis, which requires @xmath to be real, and therefore @xmath [ 267
, 27 ] . This induces a limiting speed for the motion of the @xmath
-brane moving along the throat; slow-motion corresponds to @xmath ,
whereas relativistic motion of the brane gives @xmath .

In FLRW space-time, the equation of motion for the inflaton is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the non-relativistic limit @xmath and for constant @xmath , Eq. ( 6.4
) reduces to the Klein–Gordon equation for a canonically normalised
scalar field in a FLRW background.

What is the likely value for @xmath ? We revisit our discussion of §
3.4.1 . There, we provided an estimate, valid at next-order in
slow-roll, of the bispectrum amplitude in the equilateral mode. For our
purposes it is, however, enough to consider its leading-order behaviour
@xmath [ 74 ] [cf. Eq. ( 3.20 )]. Using WMAP 7-year data at @xmath
confidence level, @xmath , we estimate this requires @xmath . In our
calculations we assume this upper limit will continue to be eroded
especially in anticipation of Planck ’s results. It might be even
possible that the smallness of @xmath constrains the model to be
realised in its non-relativistic limit. This is perhaps the least
phenomenologically interesting regime for DBI. Nevertheless, we will
show that preheating will display some interesting features.
Accordingly, we suppose that inflation is approximately of the slow-roll
variety. In this limit, the evolution of @xmath is close to that in a
canonical model, where the corrections are controlled by the deviation
of @xmath from unity. We will solve Eq. ( 6.4 ) perturbatively in powers
of these small deviations.

In this description the brane will slowly drift towards the tip of the
throat, where inflation ends. Near the tip of the throat, the warp
factor decreases [ 259 , 268 ] . Silverstein & Tong [ 27 ] suggested
that the relevant physics of the capped throat could be captured by
taking

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the dimensionless ’t Hooft coupling and @xmath is the
energy scale associated with the infrared cut-off. For convenience, we
choose coordinates so that the final resting place of the brane
corresponds to @xmath . When @xmath , this becomes independent of the
brane position @xmath , and assumes a constant value

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

We suppose @xmath , which is usually true after inflation. This means
that during one Hubble time there will occur many oscillations and
Hubble friction terms arising in Eq. ( 6.4 ) can be ignored. Our
analysis assumes the brane will oscillate around this position in warped
space with small amplitudes, contained entirely within the cut-off
region where @xmath is approximately constant. We will justify these
statements below.

Making these approximations and assuming the non-relativistic limit in
which @xmath , coherent oscillations of the brane have constant
amplitude, which we shall denote by @xmath . The respective solution to
the equation of motion ( 6.4 ) is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

Our analysis relies on the approximations described above. We list below
some important criticisms about the approximations used, and justify our
approach.

Perturbative approximation .—What other effects can spoil the dynamics
of @xmath given by Eq. ( 6.7 )? After integrating out fluxes and other
UV perturbations, we are left with a low-energy theory controlled by an
effective potential for the D-brane [ 264 , 265 ] , of the form @xmath ,
where @xmath is some mass scale. In a generic compactification, the
interaction coefficients are expected to be @xmath . The leading term
corresponds to @xmath . Invoking some symmetry may force this term to be
absent. The next @xmath term will typically dominate higher
contributions to the potential (which start with @xmath ) whenever
@xmath .

On the other hand, the infrared cutoff scale, @xmath , must satisfy
@xmath . Therefore, provided we take @xmath , so that we are safely
within a region where the warp factor is constant and given by Eq. ( 6.6
). We can thus expect corrections from both features in the throat
geometry and higher-order terms in the D-brane potential to be
negligible.

Slowly evolving background .—How good is our approximation that @xmath ?
In practice, Hubble drag would cause @xmath to decrease slowly, roughly
like @xmath [ 269 ] , typical of a matter dominated phase. This is
because the pressure of the fluid associated with the inflaton should be
averaged out over the many oscillations the brane executes around @xmath
. Take @xmath and @xmath to be two values of the Hubble parameter
separated by @xmath oscillations. It follows that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is some constant of order unity. The corresponding
oscillation amplitudes, @xmath and @xmath , are related by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

in which @xmath is different from @xmath , but also of order unity.
Unless @xmath , our assumption that @xmath is sufficient to ensure
@xmath . In addition, Eq. ( 6.9 ) shows that @xmath is sufficient to
ensure @xmath . In view of the requirement @xmath to ensure the
quadratic potential is an adequate approximation, where @xmath is
typically of order the infrared cutoff scale, this is amply satisfied.
Therefore, in what follows, we will restrict our attention to a
sufficiently large number of oscillations, say @xmath , and neglect the
time-dependence of both @xmath and @xmath .

Relativistic corrections to the background solution. .—According to the
approximations listed above, corrections to the non-relativistic motion
described by ( 6.7 ) will be perturbative provided @xmath . To check
that our analysis satisfies this approximation, it is useful to
introduce a dimensionless positive quantity, which we shall denote by
@xmath , satisfying

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

The condition above can then be rewritten as @xmath . But how small can
@xmath be? In order for the small relativistic corrections not to be
dominated by others which we have neglected, one needs to impose, for
consistency, @xmath or @xmath . We should trust our analysis for perhaps
@xmath to @xmath , but certainly not for significantly larger or smaller
@xmath .

We now evaluate the next-order @xmath corrections to the leading-order
solution ( 6.7 ). The governing equation can be obtained by dropping
Hubble friction terms in Eq. ( 6.4 ), in agreement with our
approximation, which gives

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

One could attempt to solve Eq. ( 6.11 ) perturbatively, writing @xmath
with @xmath of @xmath . However, this procedure does not produce an
appropriate, self-consistent solution since Eq. ( 6.11 ) also induces
corrections to the fundamental oscillation frequency @xmath .

To capture these physical effects, we take another ansatz: we assume a
WKB-type solution of the form @xmath . We now need to solve for the
phase @xmath to order @xmath . To recover Eq. ( 6.7 ) in the limit when
@xmath , we require @xmath . Replacing in Eq. ( 6.11 ), we conclude that
@xmath must satisfy the following differential equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

Dropping an unwanted divergent contribution, ² ² 2 This mode is
proportional to @xmath , which is divergent at @xmath . We choose its
coefficient so that this mode is projected out by the boundary
conditions, and therefore does not lead to an instability in the
solution. the background solution is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

In principle, one can calculate corrections to the amplitude, but we
will ignore the time-dependence of @xmath (we will see in Fig. 6.1 this
is indeed a good approximation).

In comparison with the canonical solution, the phase shows a drift
proportional to @xmath . Although the calculation remains under
perturbative control, this drift generates order unity deviations from
the non-relativistic background after @xmath oscillations. There is also
a superposed phase oscillation, proportional to @xmath , which always
generates small corrections. To make the comparison with the canonical
solution more clear, we write ( 6.13 ) as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is equivalent to ( 6.13 ) up to @xmath . Eq. ( 6.14 ) exhibits the
first perturbative relativistic corrections to the motion of the brane:
first, a frequency shift in the background motion @xmath , corresponding
to @xmath ; and second, a small periodic fluctuation superposed over the
background oscillations.

[0,1, [] , Plot of the numerical (red) and approximate (blue) solution
of Eq. ( 6.11 ), and the cosine function (green).] On the left we plot
the numerical solution of Eq. ( 6.11 ), which is completely overlaid by
the blue curve, given by ( 6.14 ). In contrast, the simple trigonometric
solution ( 6.7 ) stops being a good approximation to the dynamics of the
background field @xmath soon after one oscillation. Indeed, the true
solution is shown to drift away from the simple cosine—this is the
effect of the phase drift mentioned above. The amplitude, however, is
very lightly modulated over the coherent oscillations, and remains
almost constant.

#### 6.2.1 Coupling to matter fields

The reheating phase is designed to populate the universe with Standard
Model degrees of freedom, whilst dissipating the energy stored in the
inflaton field. Pauli’s exclusion principle usually prevents efficient
preheating into fermions [ 270 , 271 ] , so we suppose the inflaton
@xmath couples to bosonic degrees of freedom, which are taken to have
spin zero for simplicity. The subsequent decay into fermions has also
been studied in Refs. [ 241 , 272 ] .

We treat the couplings between the inflaton and the matter modes
phenomenologically, denoting the matter field by @xmath and taking it to
be described by the low-energy effective Lagrangian

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a dimensionless coupling and @xmath is a bare mass. Eq.
( 6.15 ) should be regarded as a subset of the Lagrangian of the
interacting theory. We do not claim that such interactions necessarily
arise in string models, although we hope the resulting phenomenology
will be representative of those that do. For our purposes, it suffices
to consider the subset ( 6.15 ) as a possible interaction channel which
shall expose the features of the preheating stage in these models. The
equation of motion for @xmath is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the Laplacian operator. Matter production in this model
is studied in § 6.3 .

In § 6.3.4 we will study an alternative model, in which the matter field
@xmath is coupled to a symmetry-breaking potential of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

This causes the brane to be attracted to a radial position which is not
the tip of the throat, but rather @xmath . This can be interpreted as a
toy model of compactifications in which the D-branes are brought to rest
at a finite point in the warped throat.

### 6.3 Non-perturbative preheating in DBI inflation

As the brane settles towards @xmath , its coherent oscillations cause
efficient non-perturbative particle production. We briefly review this
process.

#### 6.3.1 Brief review of parametric resonance

To perform a quantum field theory treatment of preheating we need to
quantize both the inflaton @xmath and the matter field @xmath . In
particular, framing our discussion with respect to @xmath , we want to
write the two linearly independent solutions of

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the comoving wavenumber. We label these solutions @xmath
and @xmath . We write the Heisenberg field corresponding to @xmath in
Fourier space as

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

in which we have assumed that the normalisation of @xmath has been
adjusted so that @xmath and @xmath obey the usual creation-annihilation
algebra,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

How many particles are produced with momenta @xmath ? The energy
density, @xmath , associated with @xmath -quanta of wavenumber @xmath
satisfies @xmath , where @xmath . Subtracting the zero-point energy, the
occupancy number is well approximated by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

We conclude that whenever @xmath or @xmath are large, the occupation
numbers will grow. In particular, if @xmath experiences exponential
growth, then Eq. ( 6.19 ) shows we can expect @xmath to attain
macroscopic values very rapidly. Eq. ( 6.19 ) therefore describes the
phenomenon of preheating, discussed in § 6.1 , and which we will
investigate in detail in § 6.3.3 .

To determine when @xmath grows, it is often useful to translate the mode
equation for @xmath into a version of Mathieu’s equation or its
generalisations. This is because Mathieu’s equation admits solutions
which fall under instability bands (in some region of the parameter
space), which signal exponentially growing modes when applied to
preheating—particle production becomes copious. The standard Mathieu’s
equation is of the form [ 273 , 274 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a dimensionless time to be defined below. In the
following sections we give explicit model-dependent expressions for
@xmath and @xmath applicable to both inflaton and matter fluctuations.

For certain combinations of these parameters the solutions exhibit
exponential growth. If @xmath , the effective mass of the scalar field
in question can become temporarily zero, which induces a copious
production of @xmath -quanta. This regime is referred to as broad
resonance , because there is a width of momenta which are favoured to
experience this instability [ 275 ] .

In the opposite regime, @xmath , and the effective mass never vanishes.
Instability bands are still present, but the combinations of parameters
@xmath and @xmath are such that the exponential growth occurs only in
narrow bands of momentum space. For this reason this scenario is known
as narrow resonance . These bands are centred on momenta for which
@xmath , where @xmath , corresponding to values of @xmath for which
@xmath [ 241 ] . If @xmath then at large @xmath these bands become
increasingly narrow. We will now study the solutions to Mathieu’s
equation ( 6.20 ) when @xmath are both inflaton and matter field modes.

#### 6.3.2 Inflaton production

First, consider the inflaton mode with momentum @xmath . We set @xmath
equal to its background value, which we denote by @xmath , determined up
to first-order relativistic corrections by ( 6.14 ). At the onset of
oscillations we assume that the matter field, @xmath , is in its vacuum
state, and so @xmath .

Until the accumulation of @xmath -quanta causes the background @xmath
field to grow, the inflaton fluctuations @xmath evolve according to the
Klein-Gordon equation. To linear order in @xmath , this is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

We expand this equation uniformly to leading-order in the perturbative
parameter @xmath and perform a change of variables so that @xmath ,
which can eliminate the friction term in Eq. ( 6.21 ). In particular, we
choose @xmath to satisfy

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The solution to this differential equation is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have chosen @xmath at @xmath . This produces a friction, or
“braking” effect, which could be interpreted as a perturbative
manifestation of the D-cceleration mechanism [ 27 ] . It is a novel
effect in the DBI model, with no analogue in canonical scenarios.
Accordingly, the braking disappears in the limit @xmath .

The remaining time-dependence is carried by @xmath , which satisfies a
Mathieu equation with @xmath and @xmath determined, to leading-order in
@xmath defined by ( 6.10 ), by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

The dimensionless time @xmath , used to write Eq. ( 6.20 ), satisfies
@xmath , which corresponds to a rescaled frequency @xmath . Inspection
of Eq. ( 6.23 ) reveals @xmath , giving resonance only in narrow bands.
The @xmath band is centred at momentum @xmath , given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

Modes with momentum @xmath will experience exponential growth.

From Floquet’s theory it follows that each mode evolves as @xmath . In
the @xmath band, also called the first band, the Floquet exponent @xmath
has positive real solutions which signal exponential growth [ 273 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

This exponent is maximal for the central value @xmath and decreases for
larger or smaller @xmath , forming a band of narrow width @xmath ,

  -- -- -- --------
           (6.26)
  -- -- -- --------

At the centre of the band, the Floquet exponent takes the value @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

So far, our formulae depend on the mass, @xmath , and coupling, @xmath ,
which appear in the Lagrangian. However, these bare quantities only
parametrise the theory. To make a meaningful comparison between DBI and
the class of canonical models, we must express our answer in terms of a
measurable mass and coupling, corresponding to physical quantities. We
denote these by @xmath and @xmath , to distinguish them from the
Lagrangian parameters. In the DBI theory the Lagrangian parameters have
no direct physical significance, whereas in the case of canonical
kinetic terms they coincide with the measurable mass and coupling at
tree-level. The relations @xmath and @xmath are derived in Appendix C.1
.

Collecting Eqs. ( 6.22 ) and ( 6.25 ), and expressing the answer in
terms of the physical @xmath and @xmath , we find that the inflaton
modes grow as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

The undetermined normalisation absorbs @xmath in Eq. ( 6.22 ). We see
that at early times, the DBI friction and the resonant growth have
competing effects. After a few oscillations, however, the cosine which
represents the friction effect becomes negligible in comparison with the
resonant term, and inflaton particle production thrives.

#### 6.3.3 Matter particle production

Ultimately, we are interested in studying the production of matter
particles. Consider the interaction potential in the Lagrangian density
( 6.15 ). As a result of these interactions the @xmath -mode receives an
effective mass of order @xmath . As in § 6.3.2 we assume that preheating
begins in the vacuum @xmath , which is a good approximation until the
@xmath -quanta are in such number density that they back-react on the
zero mode. In this vacuum, small fluctuations grow governed by a
generalised Hill’s equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the parameters @xmath , @xmath and @xmath obey

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

and @xmath . The solutions of Hill’s equation grow and decay with
characteristic Floquet exponent @xmath in a way entirely analogous to
the solutions of Mathieu’s equation. The exponentially growing solutions
also organize themselves into bands, defined by integers @xmath .

According to Floquet’s theory, one can estimate @xmath for the @xmath
band

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

We believe this expression has not previously appeared in the preheating
literature, and we provide the reader with a full derivation in Appendix
C.2 . In the region where our approximations are valid, @xmath .
Therefore, the terms involving @xmath and @xmath are negligible, and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

The centre of the @xmath band lies at @xmath , where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

for which @xmath . Collecting terms, it follows that the unstable matter
modes grow at a rate determined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

This displays a slight (perturbative) enhancement compared to the
equivalent canonical model.

#### 6.3.4 Preheating with a symmetry breaking term

Now consider the symmetry-breaking potential given in Eq. ( 6.17 ). In
this case, it is more convenient to redefine @xmath so that it describes
excitations around the true vacuum at @xmath . Writing @xmath , the
interaction potential can be written

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

Around this minimum, @xmath acquires an effective mass @xmath .

Making the same assumption as before that preheating begins while @xmath
, the inflaton modes will behave as in Eq. ( 6.28 ) until the growth of
@xmath occupation numbers causes the @xmath zero-mode to grow. Until
that time, @xmath modes with momentum @xmath obey the equation of motion

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

We will suppose the brane executes oscillations around @xmath with an
amplitude much smaller than the symmetry breaking scale, @xmath , so
that it has reasonably settled at its final position. Assuming that
@xmath , and again neglecting any bare mass for @xmath , fluctuations in
the matter field will be controlled by Hill’s equation,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

in which @xmath and the parameters @xmath , @xmath and @xmath obey

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

To determine the growth of each @xmath -mode we require an estimate of
Floquet’s exponent associated with Eq. ( 6.37 ), which is again derived
in Appendix C.2 . For the @xmath band, it is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

As above, the terms involving @xmath and @xmath can be neglected. The
result is equivalent to a Mathieu’s equation with coefficients @xmath
and @xmath satisfying

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath is much smaller than @xmath , we expect resonance to be of
the narrow-type, if it occurs at all. The first instability band occurs
when @xmath and is centred at momentum @xmath , where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is shifted by @xmath in comparison with the canonical case.

Eqs. ( 6.33 ) and ( 6.41 ) show that the @xmath resonance injects energy
into a narrow band of modes with momenta @xmath . Kofman, Linde &
Starobinksy interpreted the narrowness of this resonance as a decay
process in which a single inflaton particle of mass @xmath decays
continuously into two @xmath -particles with opposite momenta of
magnitude @xmath [ 236 ] . Our results are in agreement with their
interpretation.

The width of the resonant band satisfies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the appropriate limit of Eq. ( 6.39 ) to estimate @xmath , or
applying Eq. ( 6.25 ), we conclude that there is a perturbative
enhancement of preheating efficiency owing to the relativistic DBI
correction. Near the centre of the @xmath band, the @xmath -modes grow
as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

in which the growth rate is augmented with respect to the
non-relativistic or canonical cases by an @xmath term. This agrees with
our expectation that any change in the preheating process would have to
be perturbative in @xmath , by assumption.

#### 6.3.5 Efficiency of narrow-resonance preheating

How efficient is the preheating mechanism described above? The
resonances we have discussed are of narrow-type, and therefore
occupation numbers grow only for a very limited range of momenta. This
process is much less efficient than broad resonance, where a larger
range of momenta experience growing occupation numbers.

Nevertheless, the rate of growth is exponential within the unstable
bands, and therefore preheating by narrow resonance may still lead to an
acceptably rapid conversion of inflaton modes into matter species. After
some oscillations, gravitational redshift will cause modes of fixed
comoving wavenumber to drift slowly through each unstable band, from
ultraviolet to infrared. It follows that significant particle production
will occur only when modes remain within an unstable band for
sufficiently long and particle production is not diluted by the
universe’s expansion [ 241 ] . If wavenumbers move through the unstable
bands too rapidly, then little stimulated emission occurs, and the
resonance is washed out by the expansion of the universe. In this
situation preheating is inefficient in repopulating the universe.

The arguments of Floquet’s theory show that in each resonant band, the
inflaton and matter fluctuations of wavenumber @xmath grow like @xmath .
Let us focus on the broadest instability band, which corresponds to
@xmath and which will generally dominate the particle production. This
band has width @xmath , so each wavenumber remains within the unstable
band for a time of order @xmath . The resonance will be stable against
Hubble expansion if @xmath . It follows that preheating will efficiently
drain energy from the inflaton provided

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

For the matter field, preheating will operate in the cases @xmath and
@xmath whenever

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

or

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

apply, respectively. In the absence of knowledge of these parameters, we
assume these conditions are verified.

### 6.4 Perturbative reheating in DBI inflation

The preheating process described and studied above is non-relativistic
in nature and generates copious production of particles. While it
occurs, it is still possible for perturbative processes to happen, by
which the inflaton decays into matter species [ 276 ] . Indeed, these
processes are necessary to thermalise the post-inflationary universe and
bring reheating to an end. Ultimately they should take over the
preheating era once this has become inefficient against Hubble
expansion.

In the theories we have been considering, such decays are allowed by the
symmetry-breaking potential studied in § 6.3.4 , where there is an
effective trilinear interaction @xmath which permits the decay @xmath .
The simple potential ( 6.15 ) allows only for two-body scattering.
However, in the presence of an oscillating background field we can take
the decay rate to be similar to that produced by the @xmath interaction
with @xmath .

If the inflaton couples directly to the fermionic sector, then
perturbative production can proceed via Yukawa interactions described by
@xmath , with @xmath denoting the Dirac fermion and @xmath its adjoint.
In this case it is important to suppose that any interactions in which
the inflaton participates are not sufficient to spoil the possibility of
successful inflation.

In this section we will continue to assume that the inflaton mass is
much larger than the bare mass of @xmath , or the mass of any fermionic
species where such couplings exist. Under these conditions, the
tree-level decay rates for @xmath and @xmath can be calculated
straightforwardly. The necessary expressions were given in Kofman, Linde
and Starobinsky’s review ³ ³ 3 Modifications to these rates and
cross-sections to incorporate physical quantities in the DBI model are
derived in Appendix C.1 . [ 241 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the measured Yukawa coupling, determined by matching
Eq. ( 6.44 ) to observation.

Can perturbative decays compete with preheating? In one oscillation, we
can estimate that perturbative decays populate the @xmath field
occupation numbers at a rate @xmath . In the same time interval
preheating increases the population at a rate @xmath . We conclude that
perturbative decays dominate preheating when

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

Let us suppose Eq. ( 6.45 ) applies. These processes are comparatively
slow and it is reasonable to assume that the decay products thermalise.
This results in a transition to a radiation dominated universe and we
can estimate the reheating temperature , @xmath , to be [ 241 ]

  -- -- -- --------
           (6.46)
  -- -- -- --------

where @xmath is the rate of the dominant decay channel.

Let us briefly recapitulate the rôle of perturbative processes in
canonical inflation. Inflaton decays @xmath can become the dominant
channel for inflaton decay only in the case of symmetry breaking, for
which @xmath , as illustrated in the interactions ( 6.17 ) [ 241 ] .
These decays begin to dominate when the amplitude of inflaton
oscillations has dropped to @xmath . If we suppose that the curvature
perturbation synthesized during the inflationary phase, denoted @xmath ,
was dominated by fluctuations in the inflaton, then we must demand
@xmath enforced by agreement with observations. This, however, need not
be the case. For example, if @xmath receives a dominant contribution
from other sources, a wider range of masses @xmath can be tolerated.
Supposing further that the interaction coupling @xmath is typically
@xmath , we find the reheating temperature is of order the symmetry
breaking scale

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

If, on the other hand, the dominant decay is into fermions, then the
Yukawa coupling must satisfy

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

Suitable values for the inflaton mass @xmath and couplings @xmath can be
found so that this condition applies, but these choices are
fundamentally model-dependent. As an example, if we assume @xmath and
@xmath , we find the universe reheats at a temperature

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 6.4.1 Estimates of reheating temperatures

This analysis can be applied to the production mechanisms of §§ 6.3.2 –
6.3.4 . Let us work with the symmetry-breaking potential, @xmath .
Assuming a typical coupling @xmath , Eq. ( 6.45 ) implies that the
@xmath decay dominates resonant production when the amplitude satisfies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

The resulting reheating temperature receives relativistic corrections in
comparison with the temperature achieved using canonical kinetic terms.
In particular, we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

Alternatively, decays into fermions will become predominant ( @xmath )
if the associated Yukawa coupling is sufficiently large. To be more
precise the threshold is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is compatible with the conditions @xmath . In this case and for a
representative value of the coupling, say @xmath , we find that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

The estimates above should not be regarded as rigid predictions
following a period of DBI inflation. Rather they are meant to be
indicative of the differences with respect to an analogous reheating
process after a period of canonical inflation.

### 6.5 Summary of results

In this short chapter, we have studied mechanisms by which the universe
can be repopulated with matter species following an era of D-brane
inflation. We work in the limit where the motion of the brane is, at
most, perturbatively relativistic. This approximation explores the least
phenomenologically interesting regime of DBI inflation, but might be
ultimately required by observation if @xmath is small. In our analysis,
we assume the amplitude of oscillations of the D-brane as it settles
towards the minimum of the potential is significantly smaller than
whatever infrared scale caps the throat. The amplitude and phase of
these oscillations are slightly modified in comparison with a scenario
where inflation is driven by a canonically normalised scalar field.

We encounter some novel, though perturbative effects, which we list
below.

1.  In the perturbatively-relativistic limit of DBI inflation,
    non-linearities arising from the action cause a weak resonance which
    reaches an @xmath effect only after @xmath oscillations. This occurs
    both for inflaton and matter particles. In contrast, in canonical
    inflation, only matter preheating is possible. Excessive production
    of inflaton particles is problematic, but since preheating typically
    concludes after @xmath oscillations this weak resonance is unlikely
    to be fatal for the DBI model. In the ultra-relativistic limit where
    @xmath , the potential becomes unimportant and resonance is
    dynamically suppressed. This disappointing conclusion has been
    confirmed in Ref. [ 277 ] .

2.  We identify an additional ‘DBI friction’ term in the equation of
    motion for the inflaton fluctuations, which competes within the
    first oscillations with the preheating effect.

3.  We have estimated the final reheating temperature in these models
    and found these are typically smaller than in the equivalent theory
    with canonical kinetic terms. This may be beneficial in concrete
    models, where lower reheating temperatures can allow problems
    associated with overclosure of the universe by gravitinos to be
    ameliorated. The most stringent constraint on DBI models comes from
    observations of the microwave background bispectrum, which presently
    require @xmath . If our results are representative, and the
    reheating temperature falls as @xmath increases, a constraint on
    @xmath may also emerge from demanding agreement with the Big Bang
    nucleosynthesis era, which requires @xmath .

Anyway, I think that numbers are a problem in Astronomy, sizes and
numbers. The best thing to do is to relax and enjoy the tininess of us
and the enormity of the rest of the universe. Of course, if you are
feeling depressed by that, you can always look out the other way and
think how big you are compared to the atoms and the parts of atoms, and
then you are the enormous universe to those atoms. So you can sort of
stand in the middle and enjoy everything both ways.

## Chapter 7 Discussion

In this thesis we have discussed the early inflationary era driven by a
single scalar field, and studied the preheating mechanism after a
Dirac–Born–Infeld period of inflation. We will recapitulate in § 7.1 the
questions which motivated the writing up of this thesis, and in § 7.2 we
will summarise what we have learned in the process. Finally, we present
in § 7.3 a critical analysis of this work and suggest directions for
further research.

### 7.1 Questions addressed in this thesis

To understand which microphysics describes the early universe is one of
the greatest challenges in cosmology. Our only clues have been encoded
in the CMBR almost 14 billion of years ago and are at present being
mapped with high-sensitivity in sky surveys. This is the oldest
exploration in science.

Inflation has become a popular framework which, together with quantum
mechanics, explains how small inhomogeneities developed on a perfectly
smooth background. A period of inflation during the early universe is a
simple idea that ameliorates the problems with the standard cosmological
model. In this thesis we have focused on inflation where only one scalar
degree of freedom, called the inflaton @xmath , is active. As a result,
the comoving perturbation @xmath synthesised during inflation in these
models is only due to the quantum fluctuations of @xmath .

During inflation cosmological scales were pushed outside the particle
horizon. An important difference between single and multi-field
inflation models is that the primordial perturbation @xmath does not
evolve on super-horizon scales when only adiabatic modes are present.
This implies that studying single-field inflation models is
comparatively simpler.

The Planck satellite will soon be delivering data that it has been
collecting since its launch, in 2009. The huge expectations created
around Planck lie in its ability to make measurements with an
unprecedented sensitivity. It might even exhaust the amount of
information about the early universe dynamics one is able to extract
from CMB observations. On the theory side, there has been a massive
effort to understand the statistics of @xmath . If the signal is (even
slightly) non-gaussian, we might be able to use it to gain access to the
microphysical Lagrangian which governed interactions in the early
universe.

The eminent arrival of Planck ’s data poses at least two timely
questions, which were the main motivation behind the first part of this
thesis.

1.  We need to be prepared to use Planck ’s exquisite sensitivity to
    learn about inflation as much as we possibly can. Do we know what
    the error associated with the theoretical calculations of our models
    is?

2.  A significant effort has been devoted over the last decade to obtain
    the bispectrum in several classes of single-field inflation models.
    Do we understand how to efficiently catalogue the single-field
    features imprinted in the CMBR?

As we have seen, the bispectrum of perturbations in single-field
inflation is an incredibly intricate function of the underlying
microphysics. By learning more about its structure and characteristics
we are increasing our chances to use Planck ’s data more efficiently.

We also turned our attention to single-field models which do not evolve
under the slow-roll regime. In particular, we set the task of obtaining
the bispectrum signatures corresponding to models where slow-roll was
not satisfied, yet allowing for a successful period of inflation and
producing agreement with observation.

In part II we considered the end stage of a Dirac–Born–Infeld inflation
model. We wanted to understand how different the preheating mechanism
would be compared to an analogous canonical model. The details of the
generation of @xmath largely decouple from the physics of preheating.
Therefore, if a constraint arises from the preheating analysis, it could
be used in conjunction with the constrains arising from the primordial
density fluctuation.

As a result, one could use constraints arising from different, yet
complementary sets of analysis. Ultimately, using constraints from the
analysis of the bispectrum and preheating, together with observational
data, the parameter space of these theories could become so severely
fine-tuned, that it could prove those models highly unlikely.

### 7.2 Summary of the main results

This thesis is by no means the end of the story for single-field
inflation. We hope, however, that it has taken small steps towards
decoding the bispectrum in single-field inflation models. We list below
a short summary of the main results reported in this thesis.

A universal action for perturbations .—In chapters 2 and 3 we have
provided a full derivation of the cubic action for the primordial
perturbation in single-field models, which is exact in the slow-roll
approximation. We have shown it can be written in terms of only five
Horndeski operators, whose coefficients are model-dependent.

Sizing the theory-error .—We have computed a more precise estimate of
the magnitude of the bispectrum in the slow-roll regime which reduces
the previous theory-error by several tens of percent. In DBI inflation
for example, the uncertainty associated with previous estimates is
reduced by more than 90%. This calculation was urgently required by the
imminent arrival of Planck ’s data, which is expected to have a
sensitivity far superior to the precision of our previous estimates. In
chapter 3 we have reported an analysis of the rescaled magnitude of the
bispectrum, @xmath , which is valid at next-order in the slow-roll
approximation.

We have applied our results to several classes of single-field models,
and have specified @xmath for some common momenta configuration. We have
concluded that the previous, leading-order results for @xmath , were
unexpectedly much more precise than estimated. However, without
performing the computation to next-order, it would not have been
possible to specify the accuracy of the leading-order results.

The universe of shapes .—We started in chapter 4 by giving a full
expression of the scale-dependence of the bispectrum. The remaining of
that chapter was devoted to a thorough analysis of the shapes associated
with each Horndeski operator at leading and next-order in slow-roll. We
have rediscovered an exotic shape which had previously appeared in a
class of higher-derivative galileon theories. This shape did not
correlate with any existing bispectrum templates in CMB analysis. We
found that this shape can actually be constructed out of a linear
combination of equilateral shapes, provided we are prepared to tolerate
some serious fine-tuning. The recurrence of this shape raised two
fundamental problems. First, why was this shape appearing in so many
distinct microphysics scenarios? Second, if the presence of this shape
could not be used as a diagnostic tool, then how could we use the
bispectrum shape as a discriminant between models?

These questions motivated a modal decomposition of the bispectrum, which
revealed that on a particularly useful basis, the usual templates could
be well described by the first few modes. By requiring orthogonality
with the templates, one was in fact enhancing the subsequent
higher-order modes, which caused the drumlin-like features in the exotic
shape. We have learned that from a harmonic decomposition of the
bispectrum, one is able to derive consistency relations between the
amplitudes of each fundamental mode. Relations which are observables in
terms of observables are particularly powerful in ruling out models,
since they are independent of the parametrisation of the theory. We have
specified these relations for DBI and @xmath -inflation scenarios.

Beyond the slow-roll approximation .—In chapter 5 we have abandoned the
requirement of slow-roll inflation. We have rather focused on the
bispectrum phenomenology of single-field models which predict an almost
scale-invariant spectrum, whilst allowing for some breaking of the
slow-roll approximation. The results of this chapter rely on the
scale-invariant approximation, which can be regarded as a resummation
technique of the slow-roll analysis in the parameter space compatible
with a scale-invariant two-point function.

We have found that the resulting bispectrum is strongly scale-dependent,
and correctly reproduces the logarithmic dependence obtained in chapter
3 taking the slow-roll limit. We have argued that because of this string
scale-dependence, these models are more vulnerable to data constraints
arising from different scales (CMB and LSS).

Preheating after DBI inflation .—In the last chapter we have studied the
preheating stage after a period of Dirac–Born–Infeld inflation. We have
focused on the main differences between the resonances in particle
production compared to similar canonical models, and considered the
non-relativistic regime of DBI, when preheating can occur. We have found
that preheating is perturbatively more efficient in these scenarios, and
that it allows for production of inflaton particles. This is a novel
feature which does not find an analogue in canonical models where only
matter preheating takes place. We have also estimated the reheating
temperature in these models, and found it is slightly lower than in
their canonical counterparts.

### 7.3 Outlook

Figure 7.1 is intended to roughly summarise some important advances in
theoretical cosmology (it is not to scale). The lower part of the
cartogram zooms in some significant developments regarding inflation and
the early universe over the last decade. The round rectangular shapes
have width which is proportional to the number of scientific papers
whose topic is centred on non-gaussianities. In the last two years, the
scientific production in this area has been greater than that from 2000
to 2006. This remarkable effort in attempting to understand the
microphysics governing the early universe cannot be ignored. It is
likely that further investigation will follow the tendency in the last
decade, and there is indeed much to be done.

In chapter 4 we have obtained consistency relations between the
amplitudes of each bispectrum harmonic, @xmath , in two different
models. For simplicity, our analysis assumed an almost scale-invariant
bispectrum and applied to the primordial bispectrum. For a rigorous
comparison to data which is likely to be necessary given the
unprecedented sensitivity offered by Planck , an improved analysis must
be performed. On the one hand, the choice of basis should be suitable
for a bispectrum which is not perfectly scale-invariant. In particular
the CMB bispectrum shapes should be integrated over some range of
cosmologically relevant scales, and this has been neglected in our
analysis. In that case, our choice of basis is weak. On the other hand,
we inevitably need to evolve the primordial bispectrum we have
calculated to become the late-time, CMB bispectrum, which is visible in
the data. Conversely, one can use Planck ’s data and evolve it backwards
to obtain the primitive bispectrum, to which our formulae apply.

In chapter 5 we have obtained the bispectrum in single-field inflation
theories without invoking the slow-roll approximation. We have observed
the bispectrum exhibits a strong scale-dependence, but we have left the
study of shapes for future work. It would be extremely interesting to
investigate the correlation between the slow-roll approximation and the
bispectrum shapes. Are the shapes similar to the ones found before and
well approximated by the common templates? What would the modal
decomposition reveal?

In this thesis we have largely ignored the progress that has been made
on multi-field theories. In these, more than one scalar field is active
during inflation, and isocurvature modes are not generally suppressed as
a result. Obtaining theoretical predictions in these models is therefore
rather challenging. For example, the amplitude of the bispectrum @xmath
can vary significantly until the modes are frozen upon horizon re-entry
(see, for example, Ref. [ 278 ] ). Numerical tools such as @xmath N [ 57
] , transfer matrices [ 279 ] , and the moment transport equations [ 138
, 139 ] have been applied to obtain the evolution of the correlation
functions in these models. In multi-field models it is helpful to
improve our description of the inflationary trajectory in field
configuration space, and introduce the concept of bundle of
trajectories. This concept can help us relate a dramatic change in the
magnitude of @xmath close to a focusing region of trajectories. @xmath
will evolve until all isocurvature modes have decayed and @xmath has
become constant—we say the adiabatic limit has been reached [ 278 ] .

If Planck rules out single-field inflation, this opens up an opportunity
to develop models which are not as simple: multiple fields allow for a
much richer dynamics and can be in agreement with the observational
data. In particular, most of the work on multi-field inflation under the
slow-roll approximation so far has focused on models where the fields
have canonical kinetic terms (see Refs. [ 280 , 141 ] for a small sample
of these works). It is important to extend these studies to models which
contain non-canonical fields and understand the dynamics of inflation [
94 , 89 , 90 ] . Also relevant is to study the multi-field dynamics when
some of the slow-roll parameters become temporarily large, making the
slow-roll approximation invalid. Some works have performed an analysis
which is higher-order in slow-roll [ 220 ] . However, it is likely that
more sophisticated techniques are required to describe the evolution of
the multi-field system over the course of several e-folds without
imposing slow-roll (see, for example, Ref. [ 99 ] ).

This journey planner can suggest some of the near-future challenges, but
it is hard to gauge the precise direction research will take. It will
inevitably aim at some of our most elementary questions. Is inflation
more than just a good theory? Did it really happen? If so, what is the
physical microscopical Lagrangian describing these early times?
Understanding inflation may require setting it up in a string theory,
but that is a different story. In any case, we can anticipate that with
the arrival of Planck ’s data we will be closer to understanding our
early universe.

## Appendix A The slow-variation approximation

This appendix contains helpful material related to chapters 2 and 3 .

### a.1 Propagator corrections

At leading-order, the wavefunctions can be obtained from Eq. ( 2.23 ) by
setting all slow-variation parameters to zero. Choosing a reference
scale @xmath , this yields the standard result

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

Next-order corrections to the propagator were discussed by Stewart &
Lyth [ 102 ] , who quoted their result in terms of special functions and
expanded uniformly to next-order after taking a late-time limit. The
uniform next-order expansion at a generic time was given by Gong &
Stewart [ 104 ] for canonical models, and by Chen et al. [ 45 ] in the
non-canonical case. Their result was cast in a more convenient form in
Ref. [ 28 ] whose argument we briefly review.

The next-order correction is obtained after systematic expansion of each
quantity in Eq. ( 2.23 ) to linear order in the slow-variation
parameters. Contributions arise from each time-dependent factor and from
the order of the Hankel function. Collecting the formulae quoted in Ref.
[ 45 ] , one finds

  -- -- -- -------
           (A.2)
  -- -- -- -------

where @xmath is the exponential integral,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

This is well-defined for @xmath . For @xmath it should be understood as
a Cauchy principal value. For complex argument—required by ( A.2 )—one
promotes Eq. ( A.3 ) to a contour integral, taken on a path running
between @xmath and @xmath in the half-plane @xmath . Using Cauchy’s
theorem to rotate this contour onto the negative real @xmath -axis, one
finds

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

The next-order correction to ( A.1 ), expanded uniformly to @xmath in
slow-variation parameters but including the exact time-dependence, is
therefore

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

and quantities labelled ‘ @xmath ’ are evaluated at the horizon-crossing
time for the reference scale @xmath . We have used @xmath to denote the
number of e-folds which have elapsed since this time, so @xmath . The
limit @xmath should be understood after the integration has been
performed and merely guarantees convergence as @xmath . Eq. ( A.5 ) is
exact in powers of @xmath . Although terms of high-order in @xmath
become increasingly irrelevant as @xmath , all such terms make
comparable contributions to a generic @xmath -point function at the time
of horizon crossing, when @xmath , and must not be discarded. This
reflects interference effects between the growing and decaying modes at
horizon exit.

To evaluate the cubic action ( 3.3 ) we will require the time-derivative
@xmath . Using the identity @xmath , it follows that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

For the power spectrum to be conserved on super-horizon scales, @xmath
and @xmath as @xmath . The explicitly time-dependent term @xmath
apparently spoils this behaviour, but is compensated by a logarithmic
divergence from the integral in ( A.7 ), and for @xmath one finds

  -- -- -- -------
           (A.8)
  -- -- -- -------

This precisely cancels the time-dependence arising from @xmath . Note
the incomplete cancellation of the logarithm, which leaves a residual of
the form @xmath and is the origin of the @xmath term in the Stewart–Lyth
constant @xmath [ 102 , 106 ] . This is similar to what happens to the
residual @xmath and @xmath terms after cancellation of the @xmath
logarithms in the three-point function.

### a.2 Integrals involving the exponential integral function, @xmath

The principal obstruction to evaluation of the next-order corrections
using standard methods is the @xmath -term in Eq. ( A.5 ). This can not
be expressed directly in terms of elementary functions whose integrals
can be computed in closed form. It was explained in Appendix A.1 that
although @xmath contains terms of higher-orders in @xmath which become
increasingly irrelevant as @xmath , these cannot usually be neglected
when computing @xmath -point functions. The integrals we require are of
the form [ 28 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

We are again using the convention that, although @xmath depends on all
three @xmath , only the asymmetric momentum is written explicitly. In
the following discussion we specialize to @xmath . Results for arbitrary
@xmath can be obtained similarly and are given in Ref. [ 28 ] .

We introduce the dimensionless combinations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

and perform a contour rotation to express @xmath in terms of @xmath and
@xmath [ 28 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

The @xmath -integral has a series representation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the sum converges uniformly for all complex @xmath . The
right-hand side has a singularity at @xmath , and the logarithm
generates a branch cut along the negative real axis. The @xmath
-independent term @xmath is the Euler–Mascheroni constant @xmath and is
obtained by expanding @xmath in series, integrating term-by-term, and
matching the undetermined constant of integration with the left-hand
side of ( A.12 ) in the limit @xmath . It follows that [ 28 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is singular when @xmath , which is the squeezed limit where either
@xmath or @xmath . There is nothing unphysical about this arrangement of
momenta, for which @xmath , but @xmath will be power-law divergent
unless the bracket @xmath vanishes sufficiently rapidly in the same
limit.

The sum above is absolutely convergent if @xmath , corresponding to the
narrow physical region @xmath where @xmath is being squeezed. For @xmath
satisfying this condition the summation can be performed explicitly,
yielding @xmath . It can be verified that @xmath is analytic in the
half-plane @xmath . Therefore it is possible to analytically continue to
@xmath , allowing the behaviour as @xmath and @xmath to be studied. We
find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is more convenient to express our final bispectra in terms of @xmath
rather than @xmath . In the limit @xmath , Eq. ( A.14 ) is finite with
@xmath . The @xmath behaviour of the sum has subtracted both the
power-law divergence of the prefactor and the logarithmic divergence of
@xmath . Had we truncated the @xmath -dependence of Eq. ( A.9 ), or
equivalently the @xmath -dependence of Eq. ( A.12 ), and we would have
encountered a spurious divergence in the squeezed limit and a misleading
prediction of a strong signal in the local mode. Several of our
predictions, including recovery of Maldacena’s limit described by Eq. (
3.15 ), depend on the precise numerical value of @xmath as @xmath and
therefore constitute tests of this procedure.

We can now evaluate @xmath for arbitrary @xmath , although only the
cases @xmath are required for the calculation presented in the main
text. The necessary expressions are

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.15a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.15b)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

In the squeezed limit when @xmath one can verify that @xmath and @xmath
.

### a.3 Useful integrals

To simplify evaluation of the integrals arising in the calculation of
the bispectrum, we introduce a master integral, @xmath , for which the
integrals of interest are special cases [ 28 ] . We define

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . Eq. ( A.16 ) is an oscillatory integral, for which
asymptotic techniques are well-developed, and which can be evaluated
using repeated integration by parts. To evaluate the @xmath -dependent
terms one requires the standard integral

  -- -- -- --------
           (A.17)
  -- -- -- --------

We conclude

  -- -- -- --------
           (A.18)
  -- -- -- --------

We use this result repeatedly in § 3.2 to evaluate integrals in closed
form.

## Appendix B Steps beyond exact scale-invariance

In this appendix we include some details of the calculation described in
chapter 5 . Some of the material is similar to that discussed in
appendix A . Nevertheless we include it here for completeness, since the
choice of time coordinates is different.

### b.1 Dynamics in @xmath—why?

In this appendix we motivate the use of the time-coordinate @xmath
instead of the conformal time variable, @xmath . Why is this choice of
space-time foliation, which defines a hypersurface at each @xmath ,
preferred compared to the more traditional conformal time? Were we to
solve for the perturbations starting from Eq. ( 5.2 ) in @xmath
coordinates, we would obtain a formula for the propagator for scalar
perturbations, @xmath , which corresponds to the two-point correlator:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

We would proceed to solve the Green’s function equation for the
propagator, in Fourier space, which reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the comoving wavenumber and the Dirac delta enforces
evaluation at @xmath . Because scalar fluctuations will propagate at a
phase velocity @xmath generically different from that of the light, one
usually performs a change of variables, @xmath , so that the propagator
is a function of the sound horizon. To get the equation for the
evolution of @xmath in @xmath would demand inverting @xmath , which
without the premiss of working with perturbative @xmath becomes
algebraically challenging when plugging into the equations of motion
since a Taylor expansion could not be truncated. In particular, it would
be very hard to show that the propagator is explicitly symmetric under
the interchange @xmath .

It turns out that expressing the @xmath -evolution of background
quantities allows to naturally accommodate a rapidly changing @xmath ,
and therefore large @xmath , avoiding the difficulty just described. In
other words, the @xmath variable allows to sum all the powers in @xmath
.

Moreover, writing the quadratic action for the fluctuations in the form
( 5.3 ) makes the reproduction of Bessel’s equation more transparent,
without any need for perturbative expansions. For these reasons, our
dynamical analysis is presented in @xmath -time, and follows the
analysis of Khoury & Piazza [ 174 ] .

### b.2 The spectral index beyond exact scale-invariance

In chapter 5 we use @xmath as a perturbative parameter, but never its
explicit formula, since it is not necessary throughout the calculation.
We have surpassed the need to know this because of the special
properties of the two-point correlator of single-field models, in
particular that it should be time-independent on super-horizon scales.
Here we present the formula for @xmath for completeness. In the action (
5.3 ) the variable @xmath obeys the following differential equation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which implies

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath (which contributes at next-order only in the
scale-invariant approximation). We conclude that the spectral index in
these theories satisfies

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

To leading-order in the scale-invariant approximation, we find

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

in agreement with the result from table 2.1 . If we instead assume that
@xmath and @xmath are strictly constant and consider only @xmath models,
we recover the formula deduced in Ref. [ 174 ] that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

which reproduces the exact scale-invariance relation @xmath . In the
slow-roll approximation this reduces to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

at leading-order, which again agrees with the results from table 2.1 .

In the scale-invariant approximation scheme, @xmath is a next-order
quantity defined by @xmath , in @xmath models. The general formula for
@xmath in a generic Horndeski model will depend on the form of @xmath ,
and therefore @xmath . Using ( B.4 ) we conclude that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

This formula agrees with our expectation that @xmath is indeed a
parameter contributing at next-order only.

### b.3 Next-order corrections—useful formulae

When applying the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism we will summon formulae
for the corrections of the elementary wavefunctions for @xmath at
next-order in scale-invariance. This is because one should perform a
uniform expansion in the slow-variation parameters which include the
interaction vertices, but also the propagator for scalar perturbations.
In this appendix we collect some of the necessary formulae for this
expansion.

Background evolution .—As explained in the main text, we wish to study
the evolution of the background quantities in the time coordinate @xmath
. To do so, we make a Taylor expansion around the time @xmath of horizon
crossing of some reference scale @xmath and make a uniform expansion for
small @xmath and @xmath . Such expansion is well defined provided we
restrict our analysis to a few e-folds after horizon crossing. This
ensures that @xmath and @xmath have not varied significantly up to that
point, such that we can treat @xmath and @xmath as perturbative
parameters in the dynamics. As justified in the main text, this is
indeed a good approximation.

To get the @xmath -evolution of the speed of sound, @xmath , we start by
evaluating

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

To avoid cluttering the notation, we introduce the following parameters
which contribute at next-order only in scale-invariance:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.10a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.10b)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Upon integration, we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

This simplifies if we write @xmath and work perturbatively in @xmath
[that is, assuming @xmath ], as follows

  -- -- -- --------
           (B.12)
  -- -- -- --------

In the limit when @xmath and @xmath are both strictly constant, @xmath ,
and we reproduce the results of Ref. [ 174 ] :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where we have temporarily restored the dependence in @xmath through
@xmath . The additional contributions appearing in Eq. ( B.12 ) are
precisely the corrections to this purely power-law behaviour and are
relevant whenever @xmath and @xmath are slowly-varying.

Proceeding similarly to get the dynamical evolution of the Hubble
parameter, we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

which in the limit of constant @xmath and @xmath reduces to simply

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Again, recasting this result in terms of only one non-perturbative
parameter, we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

The explicit formulae in Eqs. ( B.12 ) and ( B.14 ) are relevant when
replacing in Eq. ( 5.7 ) for the scale factor, @xmath .

Derivatives of the elementary wavefunctions .—When calculating the
bispectra of Horndeski operators which are at least once @xmath
-differentiated, we will require the derivatives of the elementary
wavefunctions. We find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

whereas the wavefunction corrections to the internal lines of the
Feynman diagram obey

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

To obtain these we have explicitly eliminated the non-perturbative
dependence in the variation of the speed of sound, parametrised by
@xmath , in favour of the perturbative parameter, @xmath .

The time variation of the wavefunctions is relevant in correctly
reproducing the time-independence of the correlation functions for
@xmath .

### b.4 Useful integrals

In this appendix we list the integrals which occur when computing the
three-point correlators. They fall in essentially two different
varieties: integrals involving the exponential integral function (which
first appeared in Eq. ( 5.18 )) and those which involve power-laws and
logarithmic integrand functions. We will identify master integrals for
each of these families and analyse them separately. This section
generalises the results obtained in § A.2 .

#### b.4.1 Integrals involving the exponential integral function, @xmath

These integrals appear in the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have explicitly written @xmath as a function of the asymmetric
momentum (in this case @xmath ), even though it is a function of the
three momenta through @xmath (perimeter in momentum space, @xmath ). The
constant @xmath need not be an integer, and this is where the algebra
differs from that presented in Refs. [ 28 , 1 ] and in appendix A .

In what follows we consider positive, arbitrary @xmath . To simplify
this integral, one follows the algorithm developed in these references:
we apply a transformation of variables to convert this integral into its
dimensionless version [defining @xmath ]. We then make a rotation in the
complex plane [using @xmath ]. Applying Cauchy’s integral theorem we
arrive at

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Focusing on the inner integral in ( B.18 ), upon integrating by parts
and using the expansion series of the exponential function, we find it
has a convergent series representation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

Plugging this result into Eq. ( B.17 ) gives

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

in which @xmath denotes the polygamma function of order zero and
argument @xmath . ¹ ¹ 1 The polygamma function of order @xmath , @xmath
, is the @xmath -derivative of the logarithm of the gamma function,
@xmath . We will only require polygamma functions of order zero and one
in our formulae. In obtaining this result we assumed @xmath for the
first two contributions, whereas @xmath for the last term. This is true
for all the integrals since @xmath is strictly non-negative. Finally, we
can perform the last sum in Eq. ( B.20 ) by observing that it converges
for @xmath . We conclude that the integral ( B.17 ) has a closed-form
representation, given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a (convergent) generalised hypergeometric function,
@xmath [ 281 ] . In chapter 5 we will use the following abbreviated
notation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

which, given that @xmath is a real-valued function, makes the
identification of the real part of the result of the integral more
transparent. Explicit results for positive integers @xmath are listed in
Eqs. ( A.14 ) and ( A.15 ).

Eq. ( B.21 ) generalises Eqs. ( A.14 ) and ( A.15 ) for non-negative,
but otherwise arbitrary @xmath . In particular, Eq. ( B.21 ) is valid
for non-integer values of @xmath , which did not arise in chapter 3 .
This generalisation arises from the deviation of the slow-roll
approximation.

#### b.4.2 Other integrals

The other family of integrals which arises in the calculation of the
bispectrum is of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the constant coefficients @xmath , @xmath and @xmath contain, in
general, leading and next-order contributions in the scale-invariant
approximation. This integral is a generalisation of Eq. ( A.16 ) in §
A.3 . Provided @xmath , which is indeed the case for all the integrals
which arise in chapter 5 , this integral converges and gives

  -- -- -- --------
           (B.24)
  -- -- -- --------

Again, to simplify the notation we will refer to this integral in the
form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

We note that @xmath is a complex-valued function, but given we only
require the real part of @xmath we need to use Euler’s function to write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This explains the presence of trigonometric functions in tables 5.3 and
5.5 .

These integrals are the generalisation of the integrals discussed in
appendix A .

### b.5 Listing variables

In the main tables of chapter 5 , to simplify the formulae, we have
introduced a compact notation for combinations of momenta and
slow-variation parameters. This is summarised in the following table.

## Appendix C Details of the preheating stage

This appendix serves two purposes. First, in § C.1 we present the
dictionary between physical and bare quantities in a DBI theory. The
discussion is presented in the language of an arbitrary non-canonical
field theory for generality. Second, in § C.2 we give details of our
derivation of the Floquet exponent in Hill’s equation. This generalises
what is known for Mathieu’s equation. This appendix is companion of
chapter 6 .

### c.1 Canonically normalised theory

We start by considering a general higher-derivative Lagrangian of the
form @xmath , given by Eq. ( 6.1 ) in chapter 6 . We let @xmath denote
small excitations around the background field @xmath . Assuming
derivatives of @xmath are negligible then we can write @xmath . To
quadratic order in @xmath but including all orders in other fields, the
field propagates in a locally Minkowski region according to the action

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and ‘ @xmath ’ denotes higher-order terms in @xmath and its
derivatives.

Eq. ( C.1 ) will give a reliable description of scattering and decay
processes involving inflaton particles provided derivatives of the
background field are negligible over the relevant time and distance
scales our analysis applies. In this limit we can neglect the curvature
of space-time and work in a locally flat region, which should be chosen
to be somewhat larger than the interaction region. Eq. ( C.1 ) therefore
applies within this patch. Local scattering probabilities can be
described by taking the associated @xmath -matrix elements. On the other
hand, if the background field @xmath varies significantly over the
timescale of the scattering event then the definition of asymptotic in -
and out -states becomes more complicated, and the concept of
well-defined particles with an associated S-matrix may be invalidated. ¹
¹ 1 For example, this may happen in models where @xmath evolves at a
constant rate, such as the ghost inflation proposal of Arkani-Hamed et
al. [ 72 , 73 ] . We do not consider these models here.

Canonical normalisation .—If the vacuum is locally stable on timescales
comparable with decay processes, then @xmath must be negligible when
evaluated there. We must nevertheless retain perturbative excitations
contained in this term, whenever fermion Yukawa couplings are present.
After canonical normalisation of @xmath , the interaction terms in the
Lagrangian arise from

  -- -- -- -------
           (C.2)
  -- -- -- -------

where a comma denotes a partial derivative evaluated in the background.
In a cut-off throat, the models we have been considering correspond to
@xmath with @xmath constant and @xmath chosen to be Eq. ( 6.15 ) or (
6.17 ). Consider the symmetry-breaking potential ( 6.17 ). We only wish
to canonically normalize @xmath , which represents fluctuations around
the mean field visible to local observers as particles. Therefore, one
should shift to canonical normalisation only after expanding in powers
of fluctuations around the background field. Applying this procedure
implies that we should make the transformations

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

Measurable masses and couplings .—Whatever model we consider, the
predictions of the preheating theory should refer to the same particles.
Therefore our results should be written in terms of the masses and
couplings which are measured, for example, by a local observer who can
record the outcome of scattering events. We therefore need to abandon
the comfort of bare quantities, and rewrite our final formulae in terms
of physical quantities.

For non-canonical kinetic terms, it is possible that the evolution of
the background field causes the masses and couplings to change in time.
In this case, it is the masses and couplings measured by a local
observer at the time of reheating which are the relevant quantities.

At tree-level, the coupling @xmath of the canonically normalized field
is the coupling which is measured by experiment, and the mass @xmath of
the canonically normalized field determines the position of the pole in
its propagator. These are unambiguous, physical definitions of the
interaction coefficient and the mass of a particle. It is therefore the
quantities @xmath and @xmath which should be compared with the mass and
coupling in a theory with canonical kinetic terms.

If a Yukawa coupling is present than we should similarly rescale its
coupling constant:

### c.2 Floquet exponents from Hill’s equation

In this appendix we derive the Floquet exponent associated with Hill’s
equation. ² ² 2 I thank Joel Weller for sharing his preheating notes,
which have helped me to arrive at this result.

#### c.2.1 @xmath

We start with the case when @xmath , and @xmath , for @xmath and by
noting that in the edges of the resonance bands @xmath ; it turns out
that for the most important instability band and for @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For @xmath , this essentially reduces to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

This implies that, at lowest-order, @xmath .

Now, the instability parameter is given by [ 273 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is exclusively determined by @xmath , @xmath and @xmath and
is approximately given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We can show that this yields

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

We thus arrive at an approximate expression for the Floquet exponent

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

This expression for @xmath is valid for @xmath .

#### c.2.2 @xmath

If we now proceed and consider the case with non-vanishing @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath , we observe that the instability parameter may be
computed using again ( C.6 ), where now

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

By considering the first instability band, we take @xmath , so that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

Plugging these into ( C.9 ), we find that, up to lowest-order

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Moreover,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Finally, by substituting into ( C.6 ), we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

This generalises Eq. ( 6.25 ) suitable to compute the Floquet exponent
in Mathieu’s equation.
