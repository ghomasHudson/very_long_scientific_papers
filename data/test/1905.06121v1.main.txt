#### Chapter 1

This chapter briefly introduces the field of quantum computation
followed by the main features of NMR quantum processor architecture.
Latter part of the chapter describes the theory of entanglement
detection and experimental realization on various hardware. Chapter
concludes with goals and motivations for the work undertaken in this
thesis.

##### Chapter 2

This chapter focuses on the entanglement detection of random two-qubit
states. Random local measurements have recently been proposed to
construct entanglement witnesses and thereby detect the presence of
bipartite entanglement. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of
one such scheme on a two-qubit NMR quantum-information processor. We
show that a set of three random local measurements suffices to detect
the entanglement of a general two-qubit state. We experimentally
generate states with different amounts of entanglement and show that the
scheme is able to clearly witness entanglement. We perform complete
quantum state tomography for each state and compute state fidelity to
validate our results. Further, we extend previous results and perform a
simulation using random local measurements to optimally detect bipartite
entanglement in a hybrid system of 2 @xmath 3 dimensionality.

##### Chapter 3

In this chapter the focus is on a more general kind of quantum
correlation possessed by separable states. A bipartite quantum system in
a mixed state can exhibit non-classical correlations, which can go
beyond quantum entanglement. While quantum discord is the standard
measure of quantifying such general quantum correlations, the
non-classicality can be determined by simpler means via the measurement
of witness operators. We experimentally construct a positive map to
witness non-classicality of two-qubits in an NMR system. The map can be
decomposed in terms of measurable spin magnetization so that a single
run of an experiment on an ensemble of spins suffices to detect the
non-classicality in the state, if present. We let the state evolve in
time and use the map to detect non-classicality as a function of time.
To evaluate the efficacy of the witness operator as a means to detect
non-classicality, quantum discord was measured by performing full
quantum state tomography at each time instant and obtain a fairly good
match between the two methods.

##### Chapter 4

This chapter details the experimental detection of the entanglement
present in arbitrary three-qubit pure quantum states on an NMR quantum
information processor. Measurements of only four observables suffice to
experimentally differentiate between the six classes of states which are
inequivalent under stochastic local operation and classical
communication (SLOCC). The experimental realization is achieved by
mapping the desired observables onto Pauli @xmath -operators of a single
qubit, which is directly amenable to measurement. The detection scheme
is applied to known entangled states as well as to states randomly
generated using a generic scheme that can construct all possible
three-qubit states. The results are substantiated via direct full
quantum state tomography as well as via negativity calculations and the
comparison suggests that the protocol is indeed successful in detecting
tripartite entanglement without requiring any a priori information about
the states.

##### Chapter 5

This chapter details the experimental creation and characterization of a
class of qubit-ququart PPT (positive under partial transpose) entangled
states using three nuclear spins on an NMR quantum information
processor. Entanglement detection and characterization for systems with
a Hilbert space dimension @xmath is nontrivial since there are states in
such systems which are both PPT as well as entangled. The experimental
detection scheme that we employed for the detection of this
qubit-ququart PPT entanglement was based on the measurement of three
Pauli operators. The class of states considered, in the current study,
is an incoherent mixture of five pure states. Measuring three Pauli
operators, with high precision using our recently devised method, is
crucial to detect entanglement. All the five states were prepared with
high fidelities and the resulting PPT entangled states were prepared
with mean fidelity @xmath 0.944 using temporal averaging technique.

##### Chapter 6

This chapter presents the experimental investigations of non-local
nature of quantum correlations possessed by multipartite quantum states.
It has been shown that fewer body correlations can reveal the non-local
nature of the correlations arising from quantum mechanical description
of the nature. Such tests on the correlations can be transformed to a
semi-definite-program (SDP). This study presents the experimental
implementation of Navascués-Pironio-Acín (NPA) hierarchy on NMR hardware
utilizing three nuclear spins. The protocol has been tested on two types
of genuine tripartite entangled states. In both the cases the
experimentally measured correlations were used to formulate the SDP
under linear constraints on the entries of the moment matrix. It has
been observed that in both the cases SDP failed to find a
semi-definite-positive moment matrix consistent with the experimental
data which is indeed the signature that the observed correlations can
not arise from local measurements on a separable state and hence are
non-local in nature. This also confirms that both the states under test
are indeed entangled. Results were verified by direct full quantum state
tomography in each case.

##### Chapter 7

This chapter summarizes the results of all the projects constituting
this thesis, and the key findings, with possible future directions of
work.

## Chapter 1 Introduction

Being an intelligent species, modern human beings, i.e. Homosapiens ,
(meaning a ‘wise man’ in Latin), started using the first computing
machine named the ‘Abacus’ . Records show that the earliest users of
abacus were the Sumerians and the Egyptians back in 2000 BC. The
principle is as: a frame holding a series of rods, with ten sliding
beads on each. When all the beads had been slid across the first rod, it
was time to move one across on the next, showing the number of tens, and
thence to the next rod, showing hundreds, and so on (with the ten beads
on the initial row returned to the original position), (Fig.( 1.1 )).

That is where technology of computation was stuck for nearly 3600 years
until the beginning of the 17 @xmath century AD, when mechanical
calculators started appearing in Europe. Most notably, after John Napier
invented logarithms, and Edmund Gunter created the logarithmic scales
(lines, or rules) upon which slide rules are based, it was Oughtred who
first used two such scales sliding by one another to perform direct
multiplication and division; and he is credited as the inventor of the
slide rule in 1622, Fig.( 1.2 ). William Oughtred (1574-1660) was an
English mathematician born in Eton and he was the person who introduced
the symbol ‘ @xmath ’ for multiplication as well as @xmath and @xmath
for trigonometric functions Sine and Cosine , respectively. The slide
rule is basically a sliding stick that uses logarithmic scales to allow
rapid multiplication and division, (Fig.( 1.2 )). Slide rules evolved to
allow advanced trigonometry and logarithms, exponential and square
roots.

A further step forward in computation occurred in 1887 when Dorr. E.
Felt’s US-patented key driven ’Comptometer’ took calculating into the
push button age, (Fig( 1.3 )).

Further, the story of electronic calculator began in 1930 when world was
preparing for war. Such calculator were much in demand due calculation
of trajectories of bombs. During the Second World War, the challenges of
code-breaking produced the first all-electronic computer, Colossus . But
this was a specialized machine that basically performed “exclusive or”
(XOR) Boolean algorithms. With the advent of semiconductor-devices, in
the mid of the 20 @xmath century, the first generation of modern days
computers came into the existence which was a huge leap as compared the
huge-inefficient computation machines based on hundred of thermionic
valves. Since then the power of computing machines grows exponentially
following the then proposed Moore’s law. The law was described as early
as 1965 by the Intel co-founder Gordon E. Moore after whom it is named [
5 ] .

There have been a large number of classical algorithms/problems posed
which seem unsolvable on these computing machines although the
computational power was expanding at an exponential rate. In computer
science, the computational complexity of an algorithm is usually
ascribed to the time complexity which estimates the time to run the
algorithm as a function of order of input strings. Order of the input
string is generally denoted by @xmath while the complexity of the
computation is represented represented using big @xmath . For example,
an algorithm with time complexity @xmath is a linear time algorithm,
@xmath with @xmath represent a polynomial time algorithm while @xmath
represents the time complexity of an exponential time algorithm with
@xmath being polynomial of order @xmath . Two extreme cases are the
constant time (a sub-class of polynomial time) and exponential time,
termed as EXPTIME, complexity classes. It is understandable that if an
algorithm has its time complexity in EXPTIME class then in order to run
such an algorithm the required time scales exponentially with the size
of input string @xmath . One may not wish to wait too long, e.g. few
years, to run an algorithm. Some of EXPTIME class of problems are the
prime factorization problem, optimization problems with large number of
variables, matrix chain multiplication via brute-force search and
simulation of quantum systems using classical models. Then in the early
eighties Feynman proposed the idea of exploring quantum systems to
simulate quantum systems [ 6 ] . The idea of encoding computational
problems into physical quantum system and then harnessing the quantum
evolution to perform information processing is at the core of quantum
computing and quantum information (QCQI) processing [ 7 ] . There are
various features, e.g. quantum superposition and quantum entanglement,
which enable computation utilizing quantum systems to outperform any
classical computing machine. These concepts will be briefly introduced
in subsequent sections after introducing the basic ideas of QCQI.

### 1.1 Quantum Computing and Quantum Information Processing

Classical information processing is solely realized by encoding the
bit-strings into the classical states of physical systems [ 8 ] . For
example high or low voltages in a digital electronic circuit are used to
represent the classical Boolean states ‘0’ or ‘1’, respectively or light
or no-light can be used to encode ‘0’ or ‘1’ in an optical computer.
Most of the digital information processing hardware available today
performs classical information processing by encoding the problems into
binary strings and performing logical operations governed by Boolean
algebra [ 9 ] . Classical physical systems can be either in ‘0’ or ‘1’
state at an instant of time, and this limits the information processing
achievable on such classical information processors. On the other hand
the states of quantum physical systems can exist in superposition of ‘0’
and ‘1’. allowing new possibilities for computation [ 7 ] . Later
subsection of this chapter will address the issue of physical
realization of such quantum states. There a striking similarity between
what a classical computer does and how a physical system evolves. A
computer performs a computation on some input bit string under certain
logical operations to yield the output. Analogously, a physical system
evolves from an initial state following the laws of motion to give the
final state. The idea of simulating classical as well as quantum systems
by encoding the problem as an initial state of the quantum system was
put forward by Feynman [ 6 ] . Computation can be achieved by the
quantum evolution and the results get encoded in the final state of the
quantum system which can be read. This was radically a new way of
performing the computation.

#### 1.1.1 The Quantum Bit

Information can be encoded in the physical state of a quantum system and
the minimum dimension of the involved Hilbert space, to represent the
states of such system, is two. Such encoding can be achieved by using a
two-level quantum system, e.g. a spin-half system, generally termed as a
quantum-bit or Qubit . The two eigenstates of such two-level quantum
systems representing the logical states ‘0’ and ‘1’ are @xmath and
@xmath which represent the eigenvectors @xmath and @xmath respectively.
The most general state @xmath of a qubit can be a superposition of basis
vectors and can assume the polar form as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the global phase is ignored in writing the above polar form as it
does not have any observable effect during quantum evolution or on
measurement outcomes. The most contrasting feature of the qubit from a
classical bit is that a qubit can simultaneously exist in the basis
states @xmath and @xmath and this quantum parallelism of quantum systems
gives them tremendous computational power which a classical computer may
never match [ 7 ] . Each value of the pair ( @xmath , @xmath )
represents a valid quantum state on the surface of a three-dimensional
unit radius sphere, shown in Fig.( 1.4 ), called the Bloch sphere. The
radius of the sphere is indeed related to the quantity @xmath which is
unit due to normalization of state vector @xmath . One can observe that
the North ( @xmath ) and South ( @xmath ) poles of the Bloch sphere
represent the basis states @xmath and @xmath respectively.

Similarly one may have multiqubit quantum register. For the general case
of an @xmath -qubit quantum register, the basis vectors of Hilbert space
have dimension @xmath and can be obtained from the tensor product of
individual qubit states as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

It will be seen later that the most general @xmath -qubit state can be
put in the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

here @xmath is a @xmath -qubit quantum register of form @xmath with
@xmath and @xmath . There exist multiqubit states which can be cast in
the form of Eq.( 1.3 ) and may not assume the form given by Eq.( 1.2 ).
Such states are called entangled states and they play a major role in
QCQI.

#### 1.1.2 The Density Matrix Formalism

As discussed in the previous section, the state of a quantum system has
one-to-one correspondence with the vectors in Hilbert space. Consider a
quantum system prepared in a state @xmath and we have @xmath such
systems constituting a pure ensemble. Similarly consider another
ensemble composed of @xmath quantum systems, each of which is in the
state @xmath . If one mixes these two ensembles then how can one write
the quantum state of the resulting ensemble? The total number of quantum
systems are @xmath . Another important question is, if we now pick a
quantum system from this ensemble and measure it, what is the result?
There are two probabilities for the action: (i) The probability with
which the chosen quantum system can come from ensemble @xmath or @xmath
i.e. @xmath and @xmath and (ii) the probability with which, the chosen
quantum system after measurement collapses to @xmath or @xmath . One
thing is clear that the state description of form Eq.( 1.3 ) is not
appropriate for this situation i.e. such an ensemble can not be
represented by vectors in a Hilbert space.

It has been shown that a more suitable state representation is the
density operator formalism [ 10 , 11 , 7 , 12 ] . For a pure state the
density operator can be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

In order to write the density matrix one may choose a set of orthogonal
basis vectors @xmath and the matrix elements can be computed as @xmath .
It can be shown that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

This will lead to the condition Tr @xmath independent of chosen basis.
For pure states @xmath and hence Tr @xmath Tr @xmath . For a mixed
ensemble, the density operator of the ensemble can be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

and this correctly incorporates both the probabilities mentioned
earlier. The most general density operator for a single-qubit system can
be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

It may be noted that one-qubit mixed states i.e. states with Tr @xmath
can be represented with points inside the Bloch sphere in Fig.( 1.4 )
and the center of the sphere represents the maximally mixed state

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

For a general @xmath -qubit state the condition @xmath is valid. The
lower and upper bounds on Tr @xmath are achieved by maximally mixed and
pure states respectively.

#### 1.1.3 Quantum Evolution

In quantum mechanics there are broadly two kinds of time evolution (a)
the continuous time evolution of the states of a closed quantum system
as governed by Schrödinger equation and (b) a discontinuous time
evolution during a quantum measurement following Born’s rule for the
probabilities of the possible outcomes. Following subsections briefly
describe both of these time evolutions. A detailed description of
quantum evolution is given in Refs. [ 13 , 11 ] .

##### 1.1.3.1 Continuous Time Evolution: Unitary Evolution

Closed quantum system: The continuous time evolution of closed quantum
systems is unitary i.e. the time evolution operator can be represented
by a unitary matrix @xmath obeying @xmath . Equivalently one can say
that the state of a quantum system at time ‘ @xmath ’ transforms to the
state at a later time ‘ @xmath ’ via unitary transformation as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

For a closed quantum system, described by the Hamiltonian @xmath , the
equation for state evolution can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

With minimal assumptions and considering the case of a time independent
Hamiltonian one can solve the above differential equation. The result
leads to a time evolution operator of form @xmath . Important point to
note here is that, once @xmath is defined and the resulting @xmath is
obtained, the state @xmath at all later times evolves continuously in a
predictable fashion via @xmath . The advantage of the unitary evolution
is that such evolutions are always reversible.

Open quantum system: There can be situation that a system under
consideration interacts with its environment and usually termed as open
quantum systems. Such a composite system can be assumed to be in a
separable state @xmath . There can be three possible energy operators in
this scenario (i) system Hamiltonian, @xmath , (ii) environment
Hamiltonian, @xmath , and (iii) the interaction Hamiltonian, @xmath due
to the interaction between system and its environment. Hence the
Hamiltonian of the composite system can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

The time evolution of density operator can be obtained from
time-dependent Schrödinger Eq.( 1.10 ) as follows:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

For a pure state of form Eq.( 1.4 )

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (1.13)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

and on using Eq.( 1.12 )

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.14)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Above is the Liouville-Von Neumann equation. Although, the above
equation is derived using pure state density operator but it can be
shown that it is also valid for mixed states.
For the composite system @xmath the equation of motion can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

The solution to the above equation is of form @xmath . It is worth
mentioning here that the unitary time evolution operator @xmath acts on
the composite system @xmath and one may be interested in the evolution
of the system state @xmath only. The way out is that one may trace out
the environment to get @xmath . Evolution of @xmath can formally be
derived using Lindblad master equation formalism and we will not expand
on this here. Another important aspect here is that although the
evolution of @xmath is unitary but the state of the system @xmath may
evolve non-unitarily and irreversibly.

##### 1.1.3.2 Discontinuous Time Evolution: Quantum Measurement

During a quantum measurement process, the state of a quantum system,
e.g. Eq.( 1.3 ), abruptly collapses to one of the eigenstates, of the
observable being measured, in an unpredictable way. Quantum measurement
is typically described by a set of measurement operators @xmath . Here
the index ‘ @xmath ’ is the label of the measurement outcome after
quantum measurement @xmath . If the state of the system before
measurement is @xmath then the probability of getting the measurement
outcome @xmath , i.e. @xmath , is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

while the renormalized state after obtaining the measurement outcome
@xmath can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

The sum of probabilities i.e. @xmath , is equivalently represented by
the condition that all the measurement operators sum to identity and
usually referred as The Completeness Condition :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

One of the commonly used measurement basis is the computation basis
@xmath and in such a scenario @xmath and @xmath . Hence if one measure
the observable e.g. @xmath on a quantum state given by Eq.( 1.1 ), the
probability of getting ‘0’ or ‘1’ is given by @xmath and @xmath
respectively. The most unsettling thing here is that there is no-way to
predict that after a measurement in which eigenstate the quantum system
will collapse to! The only thing quantum mechanics predicts is the
probability with which a quantum system, after measurement, will
collapse to a certain eigenstate of the observable being measured. This
is the standard measurement scenario in quantum mechanics and is one of
the postulates of the theory. However in functional analysis of quantum
measurement theory, the quantum measurements are usually associated with
a positive-operator valued measures (POVMs). POVMs are positive operator
on Hilbert space and for a given measurement they sum to identity.
Projective measurements on a large system i.e. , measurements that are
performed mathematically by a projection-valued measure (PVM) will act
on a subsystem in ways that cannot be described by a PVM on the
subsystem alone, the POVM formalism becomes necessary.

#### 1.1.4 Expectation Values

In quantum formalism, every observable is represented by a Hermitian
operator, say @xmath . One may be interested in writing the average of
an observable resulted from a large number of measurements of such an
observable on a state, say @xmath , and can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

One may choose some orthonormal basis @xmath to expand the state @xmath
as @xmath . On using this expansion, Eq.( 1.19 ) yields

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (1.20)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Here @xmath is the matrix representation of the Hermitian operator
@xmath in the basis @xmath and the expansion coefficients can be
obtained as @xmath and hence

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using above expression, Eq.( 1.20 ) further takes the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (1.22)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

while the fact that an orthonormal basis follows the completeness
property, i.e. @xmath , is used in writing the last line of the above
equation. Similarly, for a mixed state of form Eq.( 1.7 ), it can also
be shown that @xmath .

#### 1.1.5 Quantum Gates

In classical computation, there are logical gates to realize the logical
Boolean operations e.g. OR, AND and NOT gate. There are other gates,
composed of the three basic logic gates, e.g. Exclusive-OR (XOR), NOR,
NAND, bubbled-AND ( @xmath OR) and bubbled-OR ( @xmath AND) gates.
Universal logic gates are those gates from which any arbitrary logic
gate can be realized. There are many universal gates available to
achieve arbitrary Boolean logic operations, with NAND and NOR being
common examples. Most of the multi-bit gates are irreversible in nature
i.e. given the output of the logic gate one may not always predict the
input with certainty. Analogously, similar logic gates can be
constructed using quantum systems, via unitary evolution. Due to the
unitary nature, in principle, one can always retrieve the input state of
the quantum system if the output state after gate implementation is
known. Similar to universal gates in classical computation there are
universal quantum gates. It was shown that a set of gates that consists
of all one-bit quantum gates @xmath and the two-bit exclusive-OR gate
which maps Boolean values @xmath to @xmath , is universal in the sense
that all unitary operations on arbitrarily many bits @xmath @xmath can
be expressed as compositions of one-bit and two-bit XOR quantum unitary
gates [ 14 ] .

##### The Pauli @xmath-Gate

The Pauli @xmath -gate or NOT gate is the quantum analog of the
classical NOT gate. This single-qubit gate inverts the state of the
logical qubit. The matrix representation of NOT gate is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

One may observe the action of the NOT gate on the single qubit state of
Eq.( 1.1 ) as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

Hence the resulting state is @xmath which on comparison with Eq.( 1.1 )
clearly reflects the inverting effect of the NOT gate.

##### The Pauli @xmath-Gate and @xmath-Gate

Pauli @xmath and @xmath gates have the following matrix representation.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Pauli @xmath -gate acting on @xmath results in @xmath while the
action of @xmath -gate yields @xmath . Hence the @xmath -gate introduces
a relative phase between the basis states while the @xmath -gate
introduces a relative phase as well as inverts the basis states.

##### The Hadamard Gate

Another very important single-qubit quantum gate is the Hadamard gate or
@xmath -gate. The matrix representation of @xmath -gate is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

The action of @xmath -gate on the computational basis states produces an
equal superposition of all the basis states e.g.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

##### The Most General Single Qubit Gate

The action of any arbitrary single qubit can be simulated using only
three unitary operations parametrized by four real numbers @xmath and
@xmath as following [ 7 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here the parameter @xmath introduces a global phase and has no
observable effect on the state of the quantum system.

##### The Controlled Not Gate

The controlled- @xmath or @xmath gate is a two-qubit quantum gate.
Action of this gate is to perform a @xmath operation on the target qubit
depending upon the logical state of the control qubit. The matrix
representation of the @xmath gate is:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

One can verify that the action of @xmath gate on two-qubit basis states,
@xmath and @xmath , is to leave them unaltered while interconvert the
basis states @xmath and @xmath . Another example of a two-qubit gate is
the SWAP gate which maps the state @xmath onto each other while leaving
the states @xmath and @xmath unaltered. It can be shown that the SWAP
gate can be achieved using three @xmath gates as @xmath @xmath , where
@xmath represents a @xmath gate with @xmath being the control qubit and
@xmath being the target.

#### 1.1.6 Quantum Computing

Quantum computing is a radical way of computation that utilizes the
quantum mechanical phenomena, such as entanglement and superposition,
for computation. Classical computation, in principle, can be thought of
in terms of circuits built from universal logic gates and one can
analogously construct quantum circuit using various quantum gates to
process quantum information and hence quantum computation. Information
can be encoded in the physical states of the quantum systems. The
requirement to perform quantum computation is to implement the quantum
gates efficiently. For the physical realization of quantum computation
there are certain benchmarks laid down [ 15 ] and are briefly discussed
as follows.

##### 1.1.6.1 The DiVincenzo Criterion

The DiVincenzo criterion were devised as a set of requirements for any
physical realization of a quantum information processor [ 15 ] .

-   A scalable physical system with well characterized qubits.

-   The ability to initialize the state of the qubits to a fiducial
    state, such as @xmath .

-   Long relevant decoherence times, much longer than the gate operation
    time.

-   A “universal” set of quantum gates.

-   A qubit-specific measurement capability.

There are two additional requirements specifically on the physical
realization of quantum information processor to be utilized for quantum
communications and quantum cryptography.

-   The ability to interconvert stationary and flying qubits and

-   The ability to faithfully transmit flying qubits between specified
    locations.

##### 1.1.6.2 Physical Realization

For the physical implementation of a quantum information processor,
various hardware have been tried. None of them satisfies DiVincenzo
criterion completely. Following is the list of a few physically realized
quantum processor.

-   Superconducting Josephson junctions as qubits [ 16 ] .

-   Quantum dot computer, spin-based: qubit given by the spin states of
    trapped electrons [ 17 ] .

-   Quantum dot computer, spatial-based: qubit given by electron
    position in double quantum dot [ 18 ] .

-   Optical lattices: qubit implemented by internal states of neutral
    atoms trapped in an optical lattice.

-   Trapped ion quantum computer: qubit implemented by the internal
    state of trapped ions.

-   Coupled Quantum Wire: qubit implemented by a pair of Quantum Wires
    coupled by a quantum point contact [ 19 ] .

-   Nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer: (NMRQC) implemented
    with the nuclear magnetic resonance of molecules in solution, where
    qubits are provided by nuclear spins [ 20 , 21 , 22 ] .

-   Solid-state NMR quantum computers: qubit realized by the nuclear
    spin state of phosphorus donors in silicon.

-   Diamond-based quantum computer: qubit realized by the electronic or
    nuclear spin of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond [ 23 ] .

-   Fullerene-based ESR quantum computer: qubit based on the electronic
    spin of atoms or molecules encased in fullerenes.

-   Cavity quantum electrodynamics: qubit provided by the state of
    trapped atoms coupled to high-finesse cavities.

-   Molecular magnet: qubit given by spin states [ 24 ] .

-   Electrons-on-helium quantum computers: qubit is the electron spin.

-   Linear optical quantum computer: qubits realized by processing
    states of different modes of light through linear elements e.g.
    mirrors, beam splitters and phase shifters [ 25 ] .

-   Bose-Einstein condensate-based quantum computer.

In this thesis the physical realization of the quantum information
processor is achieved utilizing nuclear spins of a molecule on an NMR
hardware.

### 1.2 Basics of NMR Spectroscopy

The magnetic properties of an atomic nucleus forms the basis of NMR
spectroscopy. A nuclear spin as well as magnetic moment are quantized
i.e. they exhibit discrete values when measured. The total spin angular
momentum of the nucleus is the vector sum of all the spin and orbital
angular momentum, of the constituting nucleons, and in general complex
to compute [ 26 ] . Similar to the electronic configuration used to
distribute electrons in atomic shells one can utilize the nuclear shell
model to arrange the nucleons ( i.e. protons and neutrons) in nuclear
energy levels [ 27 ] . From the knowledge of the nucleon arrangement in
the nucleus one can obtain the nuclear spin angular momentum @xmath . In
addition to nuclear spin, the nuclei also possess magnetic moment @xmath
which is related to the spin angular momentum as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio and is a characteristic
feature of the nucleus. For an intuitive picture, such nuclei can be
considered as tiny magnets and interact with external magnetic fields in
quite a similar way. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment @xmath placed
in a magnetic field applied in @xmath -direction, i.e. @xmath can be
written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

@xmath being the @xmath -component of the spin angular momentum. The
nuclear spin experiences a torque due to the interactions of magnetic
moment with the @xmath and dictates the precession of the spin angular
momentum, about @xmath , at a characteristic Larmor frequency i.e.
@xmath . z-direction is defined by @xmath and all the operators acts on
the vector space spanned by @xmath where @xmath is the magnetic spin
quantum number. The Cartesian components of the spin angular momentum in
the transverse direction i.e. @xmath and @xmath exhibit oscillatory
motion with frequency @xmath while longitudinal component, i.e. @xmath ,
stays stationary [ 12 ] . In this sense the nuclear magnetic moment is
analogous to the classical magnetic dipole. See Fig.( 1.5 ) for the
analogy [ 12 ] .

The energy eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian, Eq.( 1.31 ), acting on the
state space @xmath can be computed as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

One may observe from the quantum formalism of angular momentum and above
energy eigen equation that for a nucleus, with @xmath , the nuclear
energy spectrum is composed of @xmath equally spaced energy levels and
the energy gap between two consecutive levels is @xmath . The lowest
energy level is given by @xmath while the highest is given by @xmath .
The population distribution for an ensemble of identical nuclear spin at
high temperature is governed by the Boltzmann distribution [ 10 ] . For
example, for @xmath there are two energy levels correspond to @xmath and
the population of the energy levels characterized by @xmath and @xmath ,
denoted by @xmath and @xmath respectively, is governed by Boltzmann
factor as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

@xmath is the Boltzmann constant and @xmath is the absolute temperature
of the spin ensemble. For @xmath ensemble placed inside a magnetic field
of 14.1 Tesla, the Boltzmann factor is @xmath which implies only one in
@xmath spins is aligned in the external field direction which makes the
ensemble weakly paramagnetic in nature, (Fig.( 1.6 )). Nevertheless,
this slight difference between the populations of the energy levels
gives rise to a total magnetization in @xmath -direction given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the magnetic susceptibility and not to be confused with
magnetic moment @xmath .

#### 1.2.1 Interaction of the Nuclear Spin with Radio Frequency: The
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Phenomenon

The undisturbed spin ensemble in the presence of an external static
magnetic field will stay in thermal equilibrium with population of
various energy levels following Boltzmann distribution. However,
transition between the energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian defined by
Eq.( 1.31 ) can be induced using an oscillating magnetic field of
appropriate Larmor frequency. For nuclear spins in a static magnetic
field of few Tesla, the Larmor frequency is of the order of MHz, and
hence to induce the transition between various energy levels a radio
frequency (RF) field is required. In order to excite the population one
can consider the transverse RF magnetic field @xmath perpendicular to
the static magnetic field @xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are the frequency and phase of the RF field and
@xmath is the unit vector in @xmath -direction. The interaction
Hamiltonian between nuclear spin and the RF field can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Hamiltonian due to RF field can be considered as a perturbation to
the Zeeman Hamiltonian, Eq.( 1.31 ), as the magnitude of @xmath field is
a few Gauss as compared to the @xmath field magnitude. Under this
consideration the effect of @xmath can be investigated using
time-dependent perturbation theory [ 11 ] . To understand the key
features of the results of time-dependent perturbation theory one can
assume that the linearly oscillating magnetic field @xmath is composed
of two circularly polarized fields, with same amplitude and phase as
that of @xmath , precessing about @xmath -axis in opposite direction
i.e.

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.37)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

For @xmath , i.e. on resonance, the @xmath component rotates around
@xmath -axis in sync with the nuclear spin. In a coordinate system
rotating with angular velocity @xmath , i.e. rotating frame the
component @xmath will appear stationary to the nuclear spins and spins
experience a torque. By controlling the RF exposure time to the spins
they can be excited from low energy eigenstate to higher energy
eigenstates and this forms the basis of the NMR signal [ 28 ] .

### 1.3 NMR Quantum Information Processing

At the turn of twentieth century, NMR was proposed as a potential
platform for the physical realization of quantum information processor [
20 , 21 , 22 ] . The NMR quantum information processor utilizes the spin
ensemble to encode and process quantum information and the results of
the computation are obtained via expectation values of the observables.
Since then NMR has been a useful testbed for the experimental
demonstrations of quantum algorithms as well as quantum information
processing. NMR has been utilized for the experimental demonstration of
Grover’s search algorithm [ 29 ] , Shor’s algorithm [ 30 ] ,
Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm utilizing non-commuting selective pulses [ 31 ]
, Order-Finding algorithm [ 32 ] , adiabatic quantum-optimization
algorithm [ 33 ] and many more [ 34 ] .

The following subsections reviews the capabilities of NMR as demanded by
the DiVincenzo criterion [ 15 ] discussed in Sec-( 1.1.6.1 ).

#### 1.3.1 Nuclear Spins as Qubits

As discussed earlier, the atomic nuclei with non vanishing nuclear spin
placed in a static magnetic field exhibit nuclear Zeeman effect, see
Eq.( 1.32 ) i.e. degeneracy in various energy eigenstates of the spin
Hamiltonian is lifted in the presence of static magnetic field. This
generates an energy spectrum of @xmath levels. Minimum possible nuclear
spin angular momentum i.e. @xmath is one-half. Examples of spin-1/2
nuclei are @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . All such
spin-1/2 nuclei are two-level quantum systems and can encode the quantum
information as a qubit. Although nuclear spins with spin @xmath 1/2 were
utilized for NMR quantum information processing but in general
controlling higher-dimensional quantum systems in liquid state NMR is
much more complicated due to their very low coherence times.
Nevertheless, NMR qubits have been utilized extensively in the physical
realization of quantum information [ 20 , 21 , 29 , 22 , 31 , 32 , 30 ,
33 , 34 ] .

The energy eigenvalues of the spin Hamiltonian, given by Eq.( 1.31 ),
are @xmath and @xmath and corresponding eigenvectors are @xmath and
@xmath respectively. The eigenvectors, @xmath and @xmath , of operator
@xmath serve as computational basis and usually denoted by @xmath and
@xmath respectively. See Fig.( 1.7 ) for a schematic of NMR qubit.
Further, there can be more than one spin-1/2 nuclei in a molecule. Such
spins can interact via direct magnetic dipole-dipole interaction or
indirectly via covalent bonds termed as scalar-coupling or J-coupling
interactions. Dipole-dipole interactions are direct interactions of the
nuclear magnetism and need no medium while J-coupling is through the
interaction of nucleus with the electronic environment of the bonded
electron cloud to the other nuclei [ 28 ] . The Hamiltonian for @xmath
such weakly interacting spin-1/2 systems is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the scalar coupling constant between @xmath and @xmath
spins. Usually the NMR Hamiltonian, Eq.( 1.38 ), is written in frequency
units by letting Plank constant @xmath . Intuitively one can interpret
the second term of the Hamiltonian, Eq.( 1.38 ), as additional magnetic
field created by surrounding spins which further shifts the energy
levels of @xmath spin by @xmath if @xmath spin is in @xmath state or by
@xmath if @xmath spin is in @xmath state. Fig.( 1.8 ) depicts the
modification of energy levels in the presence of scalar J-coupling
between two spins.

In this scenario, each spin transition splits up into two transitions at
frequencies @xmath and results in doublet in NMR frequency spectrum. For
a given system the exact energy level diagram can be obtained by
diagonalizing the Hamiltonian given in Eq.( 1.38 ).

#### 1.3.2 Ensemble State Initialization

The next requirement of a quantum information processor is to initialize
the quantum register in a fiducial state i.e. a pure state. NMR deals
with a large ensemble and inherently the ensemble is in a mixed state.
Although mixed states are inadequate for QIP, elegant procedures were
devised independently by Cory et al. [ 20 ] and Chuang et al. [ 21 ]
whereby they have demonstrated that the spin magnetization can be
manipulated to prepare spin ensemble in an effective pure state termed
as pseudo pure state (PPS). The motivation behind such a construct is
that in NMR, one can interact with the deviation part of the ensemble
density operator by means of RF fields. So once such deviation density
part of the ensemble is initialized similar to the deviation part of
pure state @xmath then such an PPS ensemble can mimic the pure state
evolution under unitary transformations achieved via RF fields.

As discussed earlier in Sec-( 1.2 ), the NMR spin ensemble follows
Boltzmann distribution law and thermal equilibrium state of the spin
ensemble at temperature @xmath in the presence of magnetic field @xmath
can be written as follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

The term in the denominator, i.e. @xmath is the spin ensemble partition
function. For the Zeeman Hamiltonian Eq.( 1.32 ) and basis formed by
eigenstates of @xmath the diagonal entries, which are proportional to
the energy level population, of the thermal state can be simplified as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

Under high temperature limit i.e. @xmath following approximation can be
used to simplify the expression of @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.41)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a measure of thermal magnetization of spin ensemble at
temperature @xmath in the presence of magnetic field @xmath . So in high
temperature limit the thermal equilibrium state can be recast as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

One can observe that first the term on the right hand side of Eq.( 1.42
) is the uniform background represented by identity operator @xmath and
only a tiny part ( @xmath ) is in the state having deviation part @xmath
. Similarly the NMR ensemble can be initialized in PPS of form Eq.( 1.42
) and the state can be put in the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

There are a number of techniques to prepare PPS in NMR e.g. temporal
averaging [ 35 ] , spatial averaging [ 36 , 12 ] , logical labeling [ 21
] , state initialization utilizing long-lived singlet states [ 37 ] and
NMR line-selective pulses [ 38 ] . Generally such methods of PPS
preparation suffer magnetization loss due to non-unitary evolution
achieved by gradient pulses and remedies have been proposed to
circumvent such difficulties [ 39 ] . Nevertheless, it is well
established that the NMR ensemble can be initialized in the PPS which
mimics the pure state behavior and can be used for QCQI [ 20 , 21 , 22 ]
. The next subsection details the type of evolution feasible with NMR
and methods to implement unitary operation utilizing RF fields.

#### 1.3.3 NMR Unitary Gate Implementation

In the computational basis the three spin angular momentum operators for
spin 1/2 , in @xmath units, can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath ’z are the Pauli spin operators. From Eq.( 1.42 ), one can
write the deviation density matrix as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

As discussed in Sec.( 1.2.1 ), the interaction of RF fields can be
understood utilizing rotating frame considerations. The lab frame
density operator, @xmath can be transformed to rotating frame density
operator using rotation operator @xmath and can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

The deviation density operator @xmath is invariant under the above
transformation and the superscript “rot” can be dropped for convenience.
The total Hamiltonian for spin-1/2 ensemble in the presence of magnetic
field @xmath being acted upon RF field @xmath is the sum of Zeeman
Hamiltonian in Eq.( 1.31 ) and RF Hamiltonian in Eq.( 1.36 ) which can
be further transformed to rotating frame using the rotation operator.
The resulting effective Hamiltonian in rotating frame can be computed as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

The striking feature of the above rotating frame Hamiltonian is its time
independence. For the case when RF frequency, (also termed as nutation
frequency), @xmath , rotating frame Hamiltonian can be approximated as
@xmath . This approximation becomes true for the on resonance excitation
i.e. for @xmath . This approximation becomes particularly suitable for
small resonance offsets, i.e. @xmath , and strong RF pulse with
irradiation time say @xmath . One can write explicitly the evolution
operator for the RF pulse as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here @xmath is the rotation operator, in rotating frame, about @xmath
-axis through an angle @xmath dictated by RF irradiation time @xmath .
One can write explicit forms of rotation operators achievable in NMR as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -- -- --------
           (1.50)
  -- -- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

The last rotation operator is for RF pulse having a phase @xmath with
@xmath -axis in the rotating frame. Using above formulated rotation
operators one can compute the resulting state of the ensemble after the
action of @xmath , Eq.( 1.47 ) on deviation density operator, Eq( 1.45
). Considering @xmath it can be shown that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

A semi-classical description gives an intuitive picture that the initial
deviation density operator proportional to @xmath evolve to a density
operator proportional to @xmath under a rotation by an angle @xmath
about @xmath -axis in rotating frame which strikingly appears to be a
classical behavior!

Its interesting to note that a @xmath achieves the effect of
Hadamard(H)-gate while the NOT(X)-gate can be achieved by @xmath
rotation. Similarly a @xmath gate can be achieved by exploiting the
scalar @xmath -couplings of the spins and a typical NMR pulse sequence
of @xmath gate, for two coupled spins, is as follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here the time period @xmath is the free evolution for which spin system
evolve under NMR weak field Hamiltonian, Eq.( 1.38 ), to effectively
achieve the non-local operation of @xmath gate. Superscript on various
rotations denote spin label. Also the @xmath -rotation can be achieved
by cascading three @xmath , @xmath rotations. In nutshell the NMR
technique is equipped to achieve, in principle, any arbitrary unitary
operator.

#### 1.3.4 Measurements in NMR and State Tompgraphy

As mentioned earlier, NMR generally deals with the ensemble of spin-1/2
nuclei and a typical NMR liquid state sample, having volume @xmath
500-600 @xmath , contains @xmath spins. As governed by the Boltzmann
distribution, these spins generate a bulk magnetization in the presence
of an external magnetic field, Fig-( 1.6 ). External RF field can be
used to manipulate this bulk magnetization. The net magnetization in the
thermal equilibrium state, i.e. @xmath , is along @xmath -direction and
can be brought in @xmath -plane by applying RF field of appropriate
duration, using a rotation operator @xmath .

In the transverse plane, the net magnetization undergoes Larmor
precession about the @xmath -direction and can be detected by induction
coils. Changing magnetic flux induces an electromotive force in the
pick-up coils which in turn produces a detectable current. This induced
current is then digitized and stored as time-domain NMR signal and
termed as free induction decay (FID). FID typically has an oscillatory
decaying nature due to various NMR relaxation processes and one can
obtain the frequency-domain NMR signal by performing discrete Fourier
transform (FT) on the digitized time-domain signal. Such processing in
NMR results in Lorentzian peaks correspond to transitions, (Fig-( 1.8
)), between various energy eigenstate of NMR Hamiltonian, (Eq.( 1.31 )).
Schematic of NMR signal acquisition and processing is depicted in the
Fig.( 1.9 ).

The normalized intensities/amplitudes of NMR peaks are proportional to
the respective spin ensemble magnetization which in turn is proportional
to the expectation value of operator @xmath in the state of spin
ensemble [ 28 ] i.e. @xmath . Its worth noting here that NMR enables the
measurement of ensemble average in a single experiment as the net effect
of the NMR measurement is equivalent of measuring, e.g. @xmath , on
individual spins one-by-one and take the average.

Any single-qubit density matrix, in the computaional basis, can be
brought into the form [ 11 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

which can further be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

One may observe that @xmath . Further, with an appropriate choice of
rotation operators one can measure the unknown parameters @xmath and
@xmath as well and hence can reconstruct the density operator @xmath in
Eq.( 1.54 ). The process of reconstructing the density operator from
several experimental settings is known as quantum state tomography (QST)
and there have been numerous studies on developing schemes for QST [ 40
, 41 ] . In this thesis, methods have been developed for accurately
measuring the expectation values of two- and three-qubit Pauli operators
in a given ensemble state which can be generalized to higher-dimensional
Hilbert spaces [ 42 , 43 , 44 ] .

Typical hallmark of QCQI, the projective measurements, generally is not
possible in NMR, although there have been few experimental studies
reporting projective measurements in NMR [ 45 , 46 ] utilizing
non-unitary evolutions by means of gradient pulses.

### 1.4 Quantum Entanglement

Quantum entanglement first described by Erwin Schrödinger [ 47 , 48 ] in
1935. Quantum entanglement [ 48 ] is a counter-intuitive feature
exhibited by quantum particles which has no analog in classical
mechanics. Quantum entanglement arrises when for a composite quantum
system we are not able to describe the state of the quantum system in
terms of quantum states of the parts. It has been shown [ 49 ] that
quantum entanglement is a key resource to achieve computational speedup
in quantum information processing (QIP) [ 50 ] and for quantum
communication related tasks [ 51 , 52 , 53 ] . Being a fragile resource,
prone to decoherence [ 54 ] , there have been proposals and
demonstrations to store and protect entanglement [ 55 , 56 ] as well as
environment-assisted enhancement [ 57 ] of the entanglement.

Entanglement detection and characterization is of utmost importance for
the physical realization of quantum information processors [ 58 ] .
There have been a large number of measures proposed for the detection of
quantum correlations [ 59 ] and in particular quantum entanglement [ 58
] . In recent years, enormous experimental efforts have gone in the
creation of entanglement. Typically in such an experimental scenario one
would always be interested in queries like does entanglement actually
get created in the experiment and can one detect and quantify the
entanglement. In general, these questions are difficult to answer. There
are many proposals to address such queries such as positivity under
partial transposition (PPT) [ 60 ] criterion, permutation based measures
of quantum correlations [ 61 ] , correlations in successive spin
measurements [ 62 ] , entanglement measures based on no-local-cloning
and deleting [ 63 ] and isotropic spin lattice entanglement
characterization [ 64 ] . Entanglement detection utilizing entanglement
witnesses [ 65 , 66 ] is also a well developed field where such
detections are explored from teleportation capabilities [ 67 ] .
Tripartite quantum states were characterized [ 68 ] using monogamy
scores as well as mutual information in permutation symmetric states [
69 ] . Universal bipartite entanglement detection using two copies [ 70
] as well as extent of entanglement by sequential observers [ 71 ] have
recently been explored in a measurement-device-independent way [ 72 ] .

Further, some of the experiments create entanglement between more than
two subsystems and there are different classes [ 73 , 74 ] of
entanglement that exist in such cases. So entanglement characterization
should be capable of distinguishing different classes. It should be
noted that entanglement characterization is much more challenging rather
than mere detection [ 58 ] . The situation is even more complex [ 75 ]
in case of mixed states [ 76 ] where geometric measures [ 77 ] have been
resorted to for quantification of quantum correlations in multipartite
and mutidimensional [ 78 ] cases.

Entanglement witnesses [ 79 , 80 ] and approximation of positive maps [
81 , 82 ] proved to be experiment friendly but lack generalization,
since most of the experiments focus on creation of a specific entangled
state and witness-based detection protocols usually require the state
information beforehand. In this thesis, the goals are to explore the
entanglement detection as well as characterization protocols and
experimentally implement them in a state-independent manner using
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). NMR has been proposed as a promising
candidate for realizing quantum processors [ 83 , 84 ] . NMR has been
the testbed for the demonstration of the Deutsch @xmath Jozsa algorithm
[ 85 , 86 ] , quantum No-hiding theorem [ 87 ] and parallel search
algorithm [ 88 ] as well as of foundational aspects such as delayed
choice experiments [ 89 ] and querying Franck-Condon factor [ 90 ] .
Control of 5 to 8 qubits for quantum information processing was achieved
[ 91 , 92 ] and bench-marking of quantum controls on a 12 qubit quantum
processor was demonstrated [ 93 ] using NMR systems. Highly accurate
control via radio frequency pulses made initialization of NMR system [
36 , 94 ] and read out using quantum state tomography [ 41 , 95 ]
accessible, in contrast to other hardware.

As discussed above, quantum entanglement is a striking feature of
quantum mechanical description of nature and was quickly followed by the
demand of a physical and more intuitive interpretation by
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen [ 96 ] . Quantum entanglement proved to be a
physical resource [ 7 ] which can be utilized to accomplish quantum
computational tasks [ 50 ] , which are impossible to perform using
classical resources.

#### 1.4.1 Bipartite Entanglement

Consider a quantum system consisting of two subsystems @xmath and @xmath
. Quantum states of @xmath and @xmath can be defined in respective
Hilbert spaces @xmath and @xmath having dimension @xmath and @xmath
respectively. The states of the composite system are defined by vectors
in tensor-product of the Hilbert spaces @xmath having dimension @xmath .
Any vector in the joint Hilbert space @xmath can be expressed as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is basis in @xmath , @xmath is basis in @xmath while @xmath
and normalization of @xmath requires @xmath . Now if @xmath represents
any general pure state of the composite system @xmath and one can
express it as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

where states @xmath and @xmath , then the state @xmath is separable else
it is entangled. Physically, the separable states are uncorrelated from
statistics of measurement outcomes perspective. In a more general case
when the system can be in any one of the states @xmath with probability
@xmath then mixed state of the system can be expressed as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath and @xmath . If the state of a composite system can
expressed as a convex mixture, of the product states @xmath , as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

then @xmath is separable otherwise it is entangled. These definitions of
bipartite entanglement can be generalized to multipartite cases as well.

#### 1.4.2 Entanglement Detection and Characterization

We review here the commonly used entanglement detection criteria for
bipartite systems.

##### 1.4.2.1 The Positive Under Partial Transposition (PPT) Criterion

The density operator of a composite bipartite system can be expanded in
a chosen product basis as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

here @xmath and @xmath are the dimensions of local Hilbert spaces of the
bipartite state. Having defined the above decomposition, one can write
the partial transposition of the density operator with respect to
subsystem A as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

Partial transposition with respect to subsystem B i.e. @xmath can be
obtained by interchanging the indices @xmath and @xmath instead @xmath
and @xmath . One may also use the fact that the usual transposition
@xmath to obtain @xmath . Partial transposition depends upon the basis
in which it is performed but the spectrum is independent of the basis
which is also true for matrix transposition. The density matrix in a
basis has positive partial transposition i.e. @xmath is PPT, if its
partial transposed density matrix does not have negative eigenvalues and
hence is positive semi-definite. If a density operator is not PPT then
it is NPT. Based on PPT there are two strong conditions satisfied by
separable states described as follows:

PPT Criterion: If @xmath is a bipartite separable state then @xmath is
PPT.

PPT criterion has an intuitive description. As mentioned earlier, the
information regarding the state of an entangled composite quantum system
is stored in the joint state of the system rather than its parts. State
of a bipartite separable composite system can be cast in the form of
Eq.( 1.59 ). Hence and partial transposition operation will
independently transpose the state of either subsystem @xmath or @xmath
and always result in PPT @xmath . Here the fact, that the transpose of a
positive semi-definite density operator will also be a positive
semi-definite, is used. Hence any state which is NPT is always entangled
[ 60 ] but a PPT state may be separable or entangled.

Horodecki Theorem: If @xmath is the density operator acting on a 2
@xmath 2 or 2 @xmath 3 Hilbert space, then @xmath implies @xmath is
separable.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.62)
  -- -------- -- --------

For higher dimensional Hilbert spaces, i.e. @xmath 2 @xmath 3, this may
not be the case [ 60 ] . There are entangled states which do not violate
Horodecki’s theorem i.e. PPT entangled states. Such PPT entangled states
makes an important class of states falls in the class of bound
entanglement, Sec- 1.4.3 .

##### 1.4.2.2 The Computable Cross Norm or Realignment (CCNR) criterion

The PPT criterion in not a necessary condition for the density matrices
acting on Hilbert spaces having dimension greater than six. Although
many stronger criteria were proposed but its worth mentioning the CCNR
criterion [ 97 ] . To describe the CCNR criterion the concept of Schmidt
decomposition is utilized. For a density matrix @xmath , the Schmidt
decomposition can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.63)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath and @xmath are orthonormal bases of the
observable spaces @xmath and @xmath . Such a basis consists of @xmath
Hermitian observables satisfying Tr @xmath =Tr @xmath = @xmath .

CCNR Criterion: If the state @xmath is separable, then the sum of all
@xmath in Eq.( 1.63 ) is smaller than 1 i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

Hence if @xmath then @xmath is entangled.

##### 1.4.2.3 The Positive Map Method

PPT criterion is an example of positive but not completely positive
(PNCP) maps. One may define PNCP as follows: Let the @xmath be linear
operators acting on the Hilbert spaces @xmath and @xmath . A positive
linear map, i.e. @xmath , will map the Hermitian operators onto the
Hermitian operators and satisfies @xmath and @xmath for @xmath . A map
@xmath is completely positive (CP) if for an arbitrary Hilbert space
@xmath , the map @xmath is also positive otherwise @xmath is PNCP. For
example, transposition is PNCP map: as transpose of a positive operator
is positive but partial transposition (equivalent to transposition after
including extended operator space) may result in negative operator.
Having defined PNCP maps, the separability criterion can be described as
follows: For any separable state @xmath and any positive map @xmath
following is always satisfied [ 60 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.65)
  -- -------- -- --------

Above condition is a sufficient criterion i.e. a state violating above
criterion is entangled but a state which doesn’t show violation may also
be entangled.

##### 1.4.2.4 The Majorization Criterion

For a general bipartite state @xmath , one can obtain the reduced state
of subsystem B by tracing out the state of subsystem A i.e. @xmath . Let
@xmath and @xmath denote the sets of decreasingly ordered eigenvalues of
@xmath and @xmath respectively. The majorization criterion states that
if @xmath is separable then

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

holds for all @xmath [ 98 ] . For separable @xmath above condition also
holds for the reduced state of subsystem A i.e. for @xmath .

#### 1.4.3 Bound Entanglement

Generally maximally entangled two qubit states, i.e. singlet states, are
needed to accomplish many tasks in quantum information theory e.g.
teleportation, superdense coding and cryptography. But generally in an
experiment, due to inadvertent noise, one ends up with mixed states. It
is a practical question that how one can create singlet state from some
given mixed states. This process of creating singlet or maximally
entangled state from given mixed states is called entanglement
distillation . Entanglement distillation can be described as follows:
Consider two parties Alice and Bob, sharing an arbitrary, but finite,
number of copies of the entangled state @xmath . Entanglement
distillation is the process of transforming available quantum
resources/states, by performing local operations and classical
communications (LOCC), to a singlet state i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

If Alice and Bob can achieve the above task with @xmath -copies of
@xmath then @xmath is distillable else @xmath is bound entangled .
Although there is no protocol which ensures entanglement distillability
but the sufficient conditions for undistillability [ 99 , 100 ] as well
as distillability [ 101 , 102 ] have already been proposed. A special
kind of undistillable entanglement is PPT entanglement. It has been
shown that

If a bipartite state is PPT, then the state is undistillable. If a state
violates the reduction criterion (e.g. , due to a violation of the
majorization criterion) then the state is distillable.

One of the first PPT entangled class of states was proposed in Ref. [
103 ] and later more classes were discovered [ 104 , 105 , 106 , 107 ] .
Entangled states that are undistillable are called bound entangled
states and PPT entangled states is the most important class of such
states. Characterization of bound entanglement is an interesting as well
as challenging task in entanglement theory.

#### 1.4.4 Entanglement Witnesses

All of the entanglement detection criteria discussed above require
knowledge of the density operator. However there is a sufficient
entanglement criterion in terms of a measurable observable termed as
Entanglement Witness (EW) [ 60 , 108 , 79 , 109 ] .
An observable @xmath is an Entanglement Witness iff:

-   @xmath for all separable states @xmath and

-   @xmath for at least one entangled state @xmath

holds. Thus entanglement of @xmath is witnessed by measuring @xmath and
establishing @xmath @xmath . It is worth mentioning here that
constructing an EW is, in general, a difficult task. There may be the
cases when a given EW unable to witness the entanglement. @xmath
confirms the presence of entanglement but for the case when @xmath ,
@xmath may be separable or entangled. EW is one of the most utilized
concept for the entanglement detection in experiments. Following has
been proved [ 60 ] as a strong criterion for entanglement detection in
experiments.

Completeness of Witnesses: For each entangled state @xmath there exists
an entanglement witness detecting it .

A few methods to construct an EW are:

-   Consider an entangled NPT state @xmath whose partial transpose, i.e.
    @xmath , has at least one negative eigenvalue @xmath and let @xmath
    be the corresponding eigenvector. It can be shown that

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (1.68)
      -- -------- -- --------

    can act as an EW for the detection of entanglement of @xmath . It
    can be proved as Tr @xmath =Tr @xmath =Tr @xmath = @xmath hence
    @xmath is entangled.

-   Consider a state @xmath violating CCNR criterion. Then by
    definition, there exists a Schmidt decomposition given by Eq.( 1.63
    ) with @xmath . In such cases, the EW can be formulated [ 110 , 111
    ] as

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (1.69)
      -- -------- -- --------

    with @xmath are the local observables in Schmidt decomposition, (Eq.
    ( 1.63 )). One can see that Tr @xmath =1- @xmath and hence detect
    the entanglement in @xmath .

-   To construct the entanglement witnesses one can consider the states
    close to an entangled state, which must also be entangled depending
    upon their overlap with the original entangled state. For a pure
    entangled state @xmath the projector based EW can be written as

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (1.70)
      -- -------- -- --------

    Motivation for the above construct is that the quantity @xmath =
    @xmath is the fidelity of the state @xmath in the mixed state @xmath
    and if this fidelity exceeds the threshold value @xmath then above
    EW @xmath detects the entanglement in @xmath . @xmath can be
    computed [ 80 ] such that expectation value of @xmath is
    non-negative for all the separable states and given as follows:

      -- -- -- --------
               (1.71)
      -- -- -- --------

    The fact that a linear function takes its maximum on a convex set in
    one of the extremal points has been used, and for the convex set of
    the separable states these extremal points are just the pure product
    states. It has been shown [ 80 ] that the above maximum can be
    directly computed and is given by the square of the maximal Schmidt
    coefficient of @xmath .

#### 1.4.5 Entanglement Measures

Above discussed methods enables the detection of entanglement in a given
state however one may be interested in quantifying the entanglement in
the state. In order to do so there exist a number of entanglement
measures (entanglement monotone) [ 50 ] . Its worth mentioning the
requirements of an entanglement measure (EM). First and basic
requirement for EM is that it should quantify the entanglement present
in a given state [ 112 ] :

-   An entanglement measure @xmath should vanish for all separable
    states.

-   An entanglement measure should be invariant under local change of
    basis i.e. it should be invariant under local unitary transformation
    of form:

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (1.72)
      -- -------- -- --------

-   Entanglement cannot be created or increased under LOCC so @xmath
    should not increase under LOCC. If @xmath is positive map that can
    be implemented using only LOCC then

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (1.73)
      -- -------- -- --------

    A stronger version of the above requirement is that @xmath should
    not increase on an average under LOCC i.e. if LOCC operations maps
    @xmath to @xmath with probabilities @xmath then

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (1.74)
      -- -------- -- --------

    The monotonicity under LOCC in Eq. ( 1.73 ), implies invariance
    under local unitary transformations.

-   Entanglement decreases on mixing two or more states i.e.

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (1.75)
      -- -------- -- --------

    This condition requires that if one starts with an ensemble of
    states @xmath , and loses the information about the single instance
    of @xmath , then entanglement should decrease.

-   For the case when one have access to two or more copies of the
    states then additivity of EM should obey

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (1.76)
      -- -------- -- --------

    Here Alice and Bob shares @xmath -copies of the same state @xmath .
    In case Alice and Bob share different states, say @xmath and @xmath
    then even a stronger requirement of additivity requirement can be
    written as

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (1.77)
      -- -------- -- --------

    Above additivity requirement is in general difficult to prove and
    satisfied by few EMs [ 113 ] .

Various EMs have been proposed which satisfy partially the above listed
requirements. Commonly used EMs are entanglement cost [ 114 ] ,
entanglement of formation [ 115 , 116 ] , concurrence [ 115 ] ,
Negativity [ 117 , 118 ] , relative entropy of entanglement [ 119 ] and
@xmath -tangle [ 120 ] . Many of these measures are used in this thesis
and their details are given in the subsequent chapters where they have
been introduced first.

Quantum discord (QD) captures the fact that even separable states can
possess quantum correlations [ 121 , 122 ] . There have been intense
theoretical and experimental advancements [ 123 , 124 ] utilizing QD to
capture nonclassicality [ 125 ] and quantum-to-classical transition [
126 ] . Dynamics of QD was studied [ 89 ] and used as a quantifier of
nonclassicality [ 127 ] . Quantum correlation dynamics in a hybrid
qubit-qutrirt system was explored [ 128 ] utilizing QD. The interplay
between entanglement and nonclassicality was explored [ 129 ] in
multimode radiation states. Invariant QD in hybrid qubit-qutrit quantum
system and tradeoff with entanglement display interesting features [ 130
] . This thesis also explores the detection of nonclassical correlations
possessed by separable mixed states using positive maps and QD. Certain
quantum states possess non-local nature of quantum correlations and
violation [ 131 ] of a Bell type inequality [ 132 ] may reveal such
non-localities. It has been shown that W class of states possess
stronger non-locality than GHZ class of states [ 133 ] . Such non-local
correlations need to be investigated from ease of experimental
implementation as well as state independence perspective.

#### 1.4.6 Entanglement in NMR

As discussed in Sec- 1.3.2 , typically the state of NMR ensemble at room
temperature remains in the vicinity of maximally mixed state and hence
it is not possible to create a genuine entangled state of the nuclear
spins in small thermally polarized molecules in liquid state [ 134 ] .
This has initiated a debate on the quantumness of the states in a
typical NMRQC experiments which argued that all the states produced by
NMR are classical. On the contrary any simulation of the dynamics of
coupled nuclear spins using any classical model has been proved
unsuccessful and it is conjectured that although the states in NMR may
be in the vicinity of maximally mixed state but the dynamics is truly
quantum mechanical [ 135 ] . This can be well observed from the
discussion in Sec-( 1.2 ) that dynamics of NMR ensemble follows the laws
of quantum evolution and as conjectured that the PPS perfectly mimics
the behaviors of pure state and indeed generates the observable NMR
signal. The the state of the sub-ensemble, e.g. in NMR, truly possesses
all the quantum features like superposition and entanglement. So with
this understanding ensemble can be prepared in any desired state and is
generally termed as pseudo to make a distinction from pure state.

### 1.5 Motivations and Organization of the Thesis

This thesis focuses on the experimental creation and detection of
different types of quantum correlations using nuclear spins and NMR
hardware. Quantum entanglement, being the most important and
counter-intuitive, is one of the main types of correlation considered in
this thesis. One of the main goals of the studies undertaken in this
thesis was to design experimental strategies to detect the entanglement
in a state-independent way that are low on experimental resources. Core
of all the detection protocols is a novel method which enables the
measurement of any observable with high accuracy. Although these methods
have been implemented on NMR hardware but they were developed in a
hardware-independent manner and hence can be utilized on other QCQI
hardware. Experimental protocols have been successfully implemented to
detect the entanglement of random two-qubit states utilizing semi
definite programming to construct an entanglement witness and thereby
detect the entanglement. This random measurement based scheme to detect
entanglement is also extended to a bipartite hybrid qubit-qutrit quantum
system. It is shown via simulations that a two parameter class of
qubit-qutrit entangled states get detected using only four local
observables. Further, schemes for the experimental detection as well as
classification of generic and general three-qubit pure states have also
been devised and implemented successfully. Protocol to detect and
classify three-qubit generic entangled states utilized only four
observables and scheme require no prior state information. Three-qubit
entanglement detection scheme is further extended to the general case of
three-qubit pure states and the effect of mixedness present in the state
is also investigated. This thesis also explores the quantum correlations
possessed by mixed and/or separable states e.g. non-classical
correlations. A positive map-based witness is used to detect the
non-classicality in the experimentally created non-classically
correlated states. Results of non-classicality detection are compared
with the quantum correlation measure QD while the state is evolving
under free NMR Hamiltonian. The salient feature of the developed
experimental scheme is that a single-shot experiment is able to detect
the non-classicality present in the state under investigation. Schemes
to detect pseudo-bound entanglement in a qubit-ququart system are also
explored. Only three observables suffice to detect the entanglement in
such PPT entangled states. In all the investigations, results were
verified by one or more alternative ways e.g. full quantum state
tomography, QD, negativity and n -tangle.

Thesis is organized as follows: Chapter 2 describes the creation and
detection of entanglement in arbitrary two-qubit states. Experimental
creation and detection of non-classical correlations possessed by mixed
separable states is discussed in Chapter 3 . Chapter 4 details the
experimental entanglement detection as well as characterization of
three-qubit random states. In Chapter 5 a more subtle type of
entanglement possessed by mixed states undetectable by PPT criterion is
discussed. The experimental explorations of quantum non-local nature of
the quantum correlations are reported in Chapter 6 . Thesis concludes
with Chapter 7 briefing the main results and future directions of work.

## Chapter 2 Bipartite Entanglement Detection on an NMR Quantum
Processor

### 2.1 Introduction

Quantum entanglement [ 48 ] is a striking feature exhibited by quantum
systems and have no analog in classical mechanics. It has been shown [
49 ] that quantum entanglement is a key resource to achieve
computational speedup in quantum information processing (QIP) [ 50 ] and
for other quantum communication related tasks [ 51 , 52 , 53 ] . In
general, the detection of entanglement is a hard problem in quantum
mechanics [ 50 ] . It has been demonstrated that the entanglement
classification and detection are daunting tasks [ 58 ] . There have been
attempts to do so utilizing methods based on Bell-type inequalities [
136 , 137 , 138 ] , quantum state tomography [ 139 , 140 ] , dynamic
learning tools and numerical schemes [ 141 ] , entanglement witnesses [
79 , 142 , 143 ] , positive-partial-transpose mixtures [ 144 , 145 ] ,
and expectation values of Pauli operators [ 146 , 147 ] . The negativity
under partial transpose (NPT) of the density operator is a necessary and
sufficient condition for the existence of entanglement in 2 @xmath 2 and
2 @xmath 3 dimensional quantum systems [ 60 , 148 ] . For quantum states
in higher dimensional Hilbert spaces there are sufficient conditions
available but complete entanglement characterization is still an open
problem [ 58 ] .

The creation of entanglement in an experiment and then detecting the
same is an important theme in experimental quantum computing.
Experimental detection and characterization of entanglement was
demonstrated using optical hardware [ 149 , 150 , 151 ] . Entanglement
was explored in an NMR scenario using an entanglement witness [ 152 ] ,
by measuring quantum correlations of an unknown quantum state, [ 153 ]
as well as by a multiple-quantum coherence based entanglement witness [
154 ] . It was shown that tomography is necessary for universal
entanglement detection using single-copy observables in a system of two
qubits [ 155 ] . Single-copy here implies that not more than one copy of
the state was used in a single run of the experiment designed for
entanglement detection. Three NMR qubits were used to simulate the
entanglement dynamics of two interacting fermions [ 156 ] . Three-qubit
entanglement was characterized on an NMR quantum-information processor [
157 , 158 ] , and the evolution of multiqubit entangled states was
studied with a view to control their decoherence [ 159 , 160 ] .

To study entanglement, at least two quantum systems are required which
can be entangled, and to begin with one can choose two two-level quantum
systems. The resultant Hilbert space, of this 2 @xmath 2 system, is 4
dimensional. Although the NPT criterion is necessary and sufficient to
detect entanglement in this case, the pre-requisite is that the full
density operator is known [ 60 , 148 ] .

A promising direction of research in the detection of quantum
entanglement is the use of local observables to find an optimal
decomposition of entanglement witnesses [ 161 ] . Although the method
assumes some prior knowledge of the density matrix, it can detect
entanglement by performing only a few local measurements [ 162 , 163 ,
164 ] . Entanglement detection schemes were designed for pure states
with totally uncorrelated measurement settings that use only two copies
of the state [ 165 ] . These entanglement detection schemes were
recently extended [ 166 ] to the case of completely unknown states with
no prior information. This scheme uses a set of random local
measurements and optimizes over the space of possible entanglement
witnesses that can be constructed thereof [ 166 ] .

In the current chapter, focus is on experimental use of a set of random
local measurements to detect bipartite entanglement of unknown pure
entangled states. Particularly interest from an experimental point of
view is that can one be able to detect entanglement using a minimum
number of experimental settings. Current experiments demonstrate the
optimality of using random local measurements to detect entanglement in
a system of two qubits on an NMR quantum information processor. The
expectation values of a set of local measurement operators are obtained
and used in semi-definite programming to thereby construct the witness
operator to detect the presence of entanglement. It is shown that a set
of three local measurements is sufficient to unequivocally detect
entanglement of most entangled states of two qubits. States with
different amounts of entanglement are generated experimentally and their
entangled (or separable) nature is evaluated by performing this optimal
set of local measurements. Further, results are validated by
constructing experimental tomographs of each state and negativity is
computed as a measure of entanglement from them. With a view to
generalize these methods to larger Hilbert spaces, simulations were
performed to detect bipartite entanglement of unknown pure entangled
states in a 2 @xmath 3 dimensional system, using a set of random
measurements acting locally on the qubit and the qutrit. It is observed
that by performing a few measurements, the entanglement of most states
gets characterized.

### 2.2 Entanglement Detection in a @xmath Dimensional Quantum System by
Sub-System Measurements

Several protocols [ 58 , 167 ] have been put forward to detect the
entanglement and most of them are based on full knowledge of the quantum
state. Most of the proposed protocols are not readily implementable i.e.
they can not be measured directly in an experiment. Entanglement
witnesses are the observables which can give a ‘yes/no’ answer on the
entanglement present in a state when measured in an experiment. For
witness-based experimental entanglement detection, knowledge about the
state is required beforehand. One may argue that if the state is already
known or has been tomographed, then one can calculate its entanglement
properties by using the witness. In the present study a different
approach is followed, where a priori state information is not required
but instead local measurements were strategically chosen. Semidefinite
programming (SDP) is used to obtain the relative weights of the
expectation values of these local measurements which are then used to
build the entanglement witness for the unknown state. Procedure outlined
by Szangolies et al [ 166 ] is followed to construct a class of
decomposable entanglement witness operators for an unknown state using
random local measurements. In this protocol, once the set of
measurements got fixed, the witness is optimized to increase the
possibility of detecting entanglement.

Consider a composite system in a Hilbert space @xmath . A witness
operator is a Hermitian operator @xmath acting on the composite Hilbert
space, such that Tr @xmath 0 for all separable @xmath and Tr @xmath 0
for at least one entangled @xmath . A witness is called decomposable if
it can be written as linear a combination of two positive operators
@xmath and @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the operation @xmath represents the partial transposition with
respect to subsystem @xmath . Further, since one would like to build the
witness operator out of local measurements, consider local Hermitian
operators @xmath and @xmath acting on @xmath and @xmath respectively.
Indices @xmath are the measurement labels that one wish to carry out for
each local system. Range of the indices @xmath and @xmath depends upon
the number of orthogonal operators spanning an arbitrary operator acting
locally on the respective Hilbert spaces, (see Sec- 2.2.2 ). One would
therefore like the witness operator to be given as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath . It should be noted here that if one were to allow @xmath
and @xmath to run over a complete set of bases in the local operator
spaces, then by Bloch decomposition, every Hermitian operator can be
written in the form given in Eq. ( 2.2 ) [ 166 ] . However, in present
case first the measurements will be chosen which one wants to
experimentally perform and then witness operator optimized in such a way
that the chances of entanglement detection get maximized.

#### 2.2.1 Semi Definite Program (SDP) for Entanglement Detection

Finding the expectation value of the entanglement witness operator W
(given the set of local observables @xmath and @xmath ) is equivalent to
finding the coefficients @xmath subject to the trace constraints on the
witness operator. Let us define a column vector @xmath where one can
take the columns of @xmath and stack them one below the other and
similarly define a vector @xmath in which experimentally measured
expectation values @xmath are stacked to form a long column vector such
that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

The SDP looks for the class of entanglement witness operators with unit
trace that are decomposable as @xmath . This is the most general witness
capable of detecting states with non-positive partial transpose as Tr
@xmath implies @xmath , since Tr @xmath Tr @xmath Tr @xmath , which can
only be smaller than zero if @xmath is not positive. Hence this
decomposition ensures the detection of bipartite NPT states. The
corresponding SDP can be constructed as [ 166 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath                        
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

SDP is implemented using MATLAB [ 168 ] subroutines that employed SEDUMI
[ 169 ] and YALMIP [ 170 ] as SDP solvers. MATLAB script and detailed
code explanation, using data in Sec- 2.2.3 as an example, is given in
Appendix- A .

#### 2.2.2 Measuring Expectation Values via NMR Experiments

This section describe the procedure followed to experimentally measuring
the expectation values of various observables using NMR for a system of
two weakly interacting spin-1/2 particles. The density operator for this
system can be decomposed as a linear combination of products of
Cartesian spin angular momentum operators @xmath , with @xmath labeling
the spin and @xmath or @xmath [ 28 ] . A total of 16 product operators
completely span the space of all 4 @xmath 4 Hermitian matrices. The four
maximally entangled Bell states for two qubits and their corresponding
entanglement witness operators can always be written as a linear
combination of the three product operators @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and
the identity operator. The symbols @xmath (1 @xmath 15) is used to
represent product operators, with the first three symbols @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath representing the operators @xmath , @xmath , and
@xmath respectively. Need is to experimentally determine the expectation
values of these operators @xmath in state @xmath whose entanglement is
to be characterized. The expectation values of these operators are
mapped to the local @xmath magnetization of either of the two qubits by
specially crafted unitary operator implemented and are summarized in
Table 2.1 . @xmath is the controlled-NOT gate with first qubit as the
control qubit and second qubit as the target qubit. @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath represent local @xmath unitary rotations with phase
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath respectively. Subscript on @xmath
local unitary rotations denotes the qubit number. The expectation values
are obtained by measuring the @xmath magnetization of the corresponding
qubit. The unitary operations given in Table 2.1 , implemented via NMR,
transform the state via a single measurement, which is completely
equivalent to the originally intended measurement of local operators,
and considerably simplifies the experimental protocol.

Description of the quantum system used for experimental demonstration of
the entanglement detection protocol is as follows. The two NMR qubits
were encoded in a molecule of @xmath C enriched chloroform, with the
@xmath H and @xmath C nuclei and encodes the first and second qubits,
respectively. The molecular structure, experimental parameters and NMR
spectrum of the thermal initial state are shown in Fig 2.1 .

Experiments were performed at room temperature (293K) on a Bruker Avance
III 600 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a quadruple resonance inverse
(QXI) probe. The Hamiltonian of this weakly interacting two-qubit system
in the rotating frame [ 28 ] is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , @xmath are the Larmor resonance frequencies; @xmath ,
@xmath are the @xmath components of the spin angular momentum operators
for the proton and carbon nuclei, respectively; and @xmath is the
spin-spin coupling constant.

The two-qubit system was initially prepared in the pseudo-pure state
@xmath using the spatial averaging technique [ 36 ] , with the density
operator given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is an estimate of the thermal polarization. One may note
here that NMR is an ensemble technique that can experimentally observe
only deviation density matrices (with zero trace). The state fidelity
was calculated from the Uhlmann-Jozsa relation [ 171 , 172 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath represent the theoretical and experimentally
measured density operators, respectively. The experimentally prepared
pseudo-pure state was tomographed using full quantum state tomography [
41 ] , and the state fidelity was computed to be 0.98 @xmath 0.01.

The quantum circuit to implement the two-qubit entanglement detection
protocol is shown in Fig. 2.2 (a). The first block in the circuit
(enclosed in a dashed red box) transforms the @xmath pseudo-pure state
to an entangled state with a desired amount of entanglement. Control of
the entanglement present in the state was achieved by controlling the
time evolution under the nonlocal interaction Hamiltonian. A
controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate that achieves this control is represented by
a dashed line. The next block of the circuit (enclosed in a dashed red
box) maps any one of the observables @xmath (1 @xmath 15) to the local
@xmath magnetization of one of the qubits, with @xmath and @xmath
representing local unitaries (as represented in Table 2.1 ). The dashed
green box represents the measurement. Only one measurement is performed
in a single experiment. The NMR pulse sequence to implement the quantum
circuit for entanglement detection using random local measurements,
starting from the pseudo-pure state @xmath , is shown in Fig. 2.2 (b).
Unfilled rectangles represent @xmath pulses, while solid rectangles
denote @xmath pulses. Refocusing pulses were used in the middle of all
J-evolution periods to compensate for undesired chemical shift
evolution. Composite pulses are represented by z in the pulse sequence,
where each composite z rotation is a sandwich of three pulses: @xmath .
The CNOT gate represented by the dashed line in Fig. 2.2 (a) was
achieved experimentally by controlling the evolution time @xmath and the
angle of @xmath rotation (the gray shaded rectangle); @xmath and @xmath
are local rotations and depend upon which @xmath value is being
measured, and the @xmath time interval was set to @xmath .

#### 2.2.3 An Example To Demonstrate Entanglement Detection via SDP

Following is an explicit example to demonstrate how the SDP can be used
to construct an entanglement witness. Consider the Bell state @xmath .
The corresponding density matrix can be written as a linear
superposition of two spin product

operators [ 28 ] as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath . Since it is known that the given state is entangled, the
corresponding entanglement witness can be constructed as [ 58 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.9)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

where @xmath is the smallest possible value such that the witness is
positive on all separable states; for Bell states @xmath . Noting that
Tr( @xmath , by definition W @xmath detects the presence of entanglement
in @xmath . However, the detection protocol discussed in Sec- 2.2 has to
deal with the situation where the state is unknown. The question now
arises whether the SDP method is able to find the minimum value of
@xmath such that the correct @xmath is constructed.

For the Bell state @xmath , the expectation values @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath yield @xmath 1/2, 1/2, and 1/2 , respectively. The experimental
NMR spectra obtained after measuring @xmath , @xmath and @xmath in state
@xmath are shown in Fig. 2.3 , with measured expectation values of
@xmath 0.490 @xmath 0.021, 0.487 @xmath 0.030, and 0.479 @xmath 0.015,
respectively (these values correspond to the area under the absorptive
peaks normalized with respect to the pseudo-pure state). These
experimental expectation values are used to construct the vector m . The
SDP protocol performs minimization under the given constraints and, for
this Bell state, is indeed able to construct W @xmath as well as the
exact values of @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath which make up the vector c
. Since the minimum value of @xmath 0 is achieved, it confirms the
presence of entanglement in the state. See Appendix- A for MATLAB code
used for entanglement detection and the SDP result.

#### 2.2.4 Entanglement Detection in Unknown 2@xmath2 States

This section details the detection of entanglement in states with
varying amounts of entanglement. The entanglement detection protocol is
implemented experimentally on several different states: four maximally
entangled states (labeled as B1, B2, etc.), two separable states
(labeled as S1 and S2), and 14 non-maximally entangled states (labeled
as E1, E2, E3, . . . ).

To prepare the 14 entangled states E1 to E14 (having different amounts
of entanglement), the control on the amount of entanglement in the state
was achieved by varying the time interval @xmath and the angle @xmath of
the @xmath rotation [Fig. 2.2 (b)]. @xmath and @xmath was used, with 1
@xmath 14. These choices for @xmath and @xmath represent a variation of
the rotation angle in a two-qubit controlled-rotation NMR gate and led
to a wide range of entanglement in the generated states (as tabulated in
Table 2.2 ).

To characterize the amount of entanglement, the entanglement measure
negativity @xmath [ 60 ] is used and is given as:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath denotes partial transposition with respect to one of the
qubits and @xmath represents the trace norm. A nonzero negativity
confirms the presence of entanglement in @xmath and can be used as a
quantitative measure of entanglement. The states prepared ranged from
nearly separable (E1, E2 with a low value of negativity) to nearly
maximally entangled (E13, E14 with high negativity values). The
experimental results of the entanglement detection protocol for two
qubits are tabulated in Table 2.2 .

For some of the non-maximally entangled states, more than three local
measurements had to be used to detect entanglement. For instance, SDP
required six local measurement to build the vector @xmath for the E
@xmath state in Table 2.2 and to establish that min( @xmath 0.

As is evident from Table 2.2 , this method of making random local
measurements on an unknown state followed by SDP to construct an
entanglement witness is able to successfully detect the presence of
quantum entanglement in almost all the experimentally created states.

The protocol failed to detect entanglement in states E @xmath and E
@xmath , a possible reason for this being that these states have a very
low negativity value (very little entanglement), which is of the order
of the experimental error. In order to validate the experimental results
full quantum state tomography of all experimentally prepared states is
also performed. The resulting tomographs and respective fidelities are
shown in Fig. 2.4 , and the negativity parameter obtained from the
experimental tomographs in each case is tabulated in Table 2.2 . Figures
2.4 (a) to 2.4 (d) correspond to the maximally entangled Bell states B
@xmath to B @xmath , respectively, while Figs. 2.4 (e) and 2.4 (f) are
tomographs for the separable states S @xmath and S @xmath ,
respectively, and Figs. 2.4 (g) to 2.4 (t) correspond to states E @xmath
to E @xmath , respectively. The fidelity of each experimentally prepared
state is given above its tomograph in the figure. Only the real parts of
the experimental tomographs are shown, as the imaginary parts of the
experimental tomographs turned out to be negligible.

### 2.3 Entanglement Detection in a 2@xmath3 Dimensional Quantum System

The orthonormal basis states for a 2 @xmath 3 dimensional qubit-qutrit
system @xmath can be written in the computational basis for the qubit
@xmath , @xmath and the qutrit @xmath , @xmath and @xmath ,
respectively. It has been previously shown that any arbitrary pure state
of a hybrid qubit-qutrit 2 @xmath 3 system can be transformed to one of
the states of a two-parameter class (with two real parameters) via local
operations and classical communication (LOCC) and that states in this
class are invariant under unitary operations of the form U @xmath U on
the 2 @xmath 3 system [ 173 ] . The state for such a bipartite 2 @xmath
3 dimensional system can be written as [ 173 ]

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.11)
  -- -- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are the maximally entangled Bell states. The
requirement of unit trace places a constraint on the real parameters
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

This constraint implies that one can eliminate one of the three
parameters, and one can rewrite @xmath in terms of @xmath and @xmath ;
however, the entire analysis is valid for the other choices as well. The
domains for @xmath and @xmath can be calculated from the unit trace
condition and turn out to be 0 @xmath @xmath @xmath 1/2 and 0 @xmath
@xmath @xmath 1. The Peres-Horodecki positive-partial-transposition
(PPT) criterion is a necessary and sufficient condition for 2 @xmath 3
dimensional systems and can hence be used to characterize the
entanglement of @xmath via the entanglement measure negativity @xmath .
The partial transpose with respect to the qubit for the two-parameter
class of states defined in Eq. ( 2.11 ) can be written as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.13)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

The negativity @xmath for the two-parameter class of states can be
calculated from its partial transpose and is given by [ 173 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

Clearly, states with 0.5 @xmath 1 have nonzero negativity ( i.e. , are
NPT) and are hence entangled. To extend the Bloch representation for
qubits to a qubit-qutrit system described by a 2 @xmath 3 dimensional
hybrid linear vector space an operator O operating on this joint Hilbert
space can be written as [ 174 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are vectors belonging to linear vector spaces of
dimension 3 and 8 respectively, @xmath and @xmath are identity matrices
of dimensions 2 and 3 respectively and @xmath are the Pauli spin
matrices used to span operators acting on the Hilbert space of the
qubit. @xmath are the Gell-Mann matrices [ 175 ] , used to span
operators acting on the Hilbert space of the qutrit; other isomorphic
choices are equally valid. A Hermitian witness operator can be
constructed for every entangled quantum state, and the expectation value
of the witness operator can be locally measured by decomposing the
operator as a weighted sum of projectors onto product-state vectors [ 60
, 80 , 176 ] . The @xmath for the 2 @xmath 3 system given in Eq. ( 2.11
) is NPT for 0.5 @xmath 1. The eigenvalues for @xmath (where PT
represents partial transposition with respect to the qubit) are @xmath ,
@xmath , and @xmath . The eigenvalue @xmath remains negative for NPT
states, and the corresponding eigenvector is denoted by @xmath . The
corresponding entanglement witness operator can be written as @xmath
with it’s matrix representation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

The entanglement witness @xmath is capable of detecting entanglement of
the 2 @xmath 3 dimensional @xmath given in Eq. ( 2.11 ). Once can
explore the decomposition of the entanglement witness @xmath in terms of
local observables, so that it can used to detect entanglement of the
two-parameter class of states of the 2 @xmath 3 dimensional @xmath . The
explicit decomposition of @xmath as per Eq. ( 2.15 ) results in the
following:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

The components of @xmath and @xmath , i.e. , @xmath and @xmath can be
obtained from @xmath and @xmath . Similarly, the elements of the matrix
@xmath can be obtained from @xmath . There are 35 real coefficients in
the expansion in Eq. ( 2.15 ), of which 3 coefficients constitute @xmath
, 8 coefficients constitute @xmath , and the remaining 24 are contained
in the @xmath matrix. Each nonzero entry in @xmath , @xmath , or @xmath
matrix is the contribution of the corresponding qubit-qutrit product
operator [ 28 ] used in the construction of operator @xmath . Hence one
can infer by inspection of the nonzero matrix entries in Eq. ( 2.17 )
that one requires the expectation values of at least four operators in a
given state in order to experimentally construct the witness operator W.
While the maximum number of expectation values required to be measured
is four, the question remains if this is an optimal set or if one can
find a smaller set which will still be able to detect entanglement.

Fraction of entanglement was computationally detected by gradually
increasing the number of local observations, and the results of the
simulation are depicted in Fig. 5(a) as a bar chart. One may note here
that even if only one observable [one element of the @xmath matrix in
Eq. ( 2.15 )] is measured, half of the randomly generated entangled
states are detected. As the number of measured observables is increased,
the fraction of detected entangled states improves, as shown in Fig. 2.5
(a). To generate the bar plots in Fig. 2.5 (a), only one random local
measurement is selected out of the maximum 35 possible measurements.
Only those choices which will establish a decomposable entanglement
witness of unit trace are valid. For one such choice (denoted by @xmath
), @xmath is plotted in Fig. 2.5 (b) in the range 0 @xmath 0.5 and 0
@xmath 1. As is evident, this @xmath (based on only one random local
measurement) does not detect all the entangled states which were
detected by W. The fraction of entangled states detected by @xmath can
be computed from geometry, i.e. , how much area that is spanned by the
parameters @xmath and @xmath represents entangled states and how much of
that area is detected by the corresponding entanglement witness
operator.

If one consider two random local measurements at a time to construct a
valid entanglement witness [ @xmath in Fig. 2.5 (c)], the detected
fraction of entangled states improves from 0.50 to 0.67 [the second bar
in Fig. 2.5 (a)]. One can observe from the geometry that @xmath detects
more entangled states than @xmath , but this fraction is still smaller
than those detected by W. The result of choosing three random local
measurements (denoted by witness operator @xmath ) is plotted in Fig.
2.5 (d), and it detects 83.3 % of the total entangled states [the third
bar in Fig. 2.5 (a)]. Increasing the set of random local measurements
hence increases the probability of detecting entanglement. The
worst-case detection fraction is shown in Fig. 2.5 (a) when choosing
random local measurements. A fraction of 1 in Fig. 2.5 (a) implies that
the corresponding set of four random local measurements will always be
able to detect entanglement in the state if it exists.

### 2.4 Conclusions

This chapter was aimed at detecting the entanglement of a two-qubit
state without any prior state information and with minimum experimental
efforts. It has been successfully demonstrated in an actual experiment
that the scheme based on local random measurements is able to detect the
presence of entanglement, on a two-qubit NMR quantum-information
processor. An optimal set of random local measurements was arrived at
via semi-definite programming to construct entanglement witnesses that
detect bipartite entanglement. The local measurements on each qubit were
converted into a single measurement on one of the qubits by transforming
the state. This was done to simplify the experimental scheme and is
completely equivalent to the originally intended local measurements.
Scheme based on random local measurements have been extended to hybrid
systems, where qudits of different dimensionality are involved. For the
particular case of a qubit-qutrit system, a simulation is performed to
demonstrate the optimality of the detection scheme. Characterization of
entangled states of qudits is a daunting task, and this work holds
promise for further research in this direction. Results of this chapter
are published in Phys. Rev. A 94 , 062309 (2016) .

## Chapter 3 Non-Classical Correlations and Detection in a Single-Shot
Experiment

### 3.1 Introduction

In this chapter, the focus is on more generalized quantum correlations
possessed even by separable states. Such quantum correlations are best
captured by a nonclassicality quantifier “quantum discord”(QD) [ 122 ] .
Quantum correlations are those correlations which are not present in
classical systems, and in bipartite quantum systems are associated with
the presence of QD [ 7 , 122 , 177 ] . In quantum information theory, QD
is a measure of nonclassical correlations between the subsystems of a
quantum system. It includes correlations that are due to quantum
physical effects and may not involve quantum entanglement. QD utilizes
the concept of mutual information. In a bipartite system the mutual
information is a measure of knowledge gained, by measuring one variable,
about the other and involves entropy in the observed statistics. In
classical information, theory there are two inequivalent expressions for
the mutual information which are equivalent for all classical
probability distributions or statistics observed by measuring systems
possessing only classical correlations. In case, the system involved
possesses quantum correlations then one gets different mutual
information, from two expressions defined in the classical information
theory, by virtue of the way they are defined. This difference is indeed
the QD as it arises due to the quantum nature of the involved system to
generate the statistics which is further used to compute QD. Formal
definition is given in Sec- 3.2.4 . Quantum correlations captured by QD
in a bipartite mixed state can go beyond quantum entanglement and
therefore can be present even in separable states [ 178 ] . The
threshold between classical and quantum correlations was investigated in
linear-optical systems by observing the emergence of QD [ 179 ] . QD was
experimentally measured in systems such as NMR, that are described by a
deviation density matrix [ 180 , 181 , 182 ] . Further,
environment-induced sudden transitions in QD dynamics and their
preservation were investigated using NMR [ 183 , 184 ] .

It has already been demonstrated that even with very low (or no)
entanglement, quantum information processing can still be performed
using nonclassical correlations [ 185 , 186 ] , which are typically
characterized by the presence of QD. However, computing and measuring QD
typically involves complicated numerical optimization and furthermore it
has been shown that computing QD is NP-hard [ 187 , 188 , 189 ] . It is
hence of prime interest to find other means such as witnesses to detect
the presence of quantum correlations captured by QD [ 190 ] . While
there have been several experimental implementations of entanglement
witnesses [ 81 , 82 , 191 ] , there have been fewer proposals to witness
nonclassicality. A nonlinear classicality witness was constructed for a
class of two-qubit systems [ 192 ] and experimentally implemented using
NMR [ 193 , 194 ] and was estimated in a linear optics system via
statistics from a single measurement [ 195 ] . It is to be noted that as
the state space for classical correlated systems is not convex, a
witness for nonclassicality is more complicated to construct than a
witness for entanglement and is necessarily nonlinear [ 196 ] .

In the this chapter two qubits were used to demonstrate the experimental
detection of nonclassicality through a recently proposed positive map
method [ 125 ] . Two NMR qubits have been recently used to demonstrate
very interesting QIP phenomena such as the quantum simulation of the
ground state of a molecular Hamiltonian [ 197 ] , the quantum simulation
of the Avian compass [ 198 ] , observing time-invariant coherence at
room temperature [ 199 ] and preserving QD [ 153 ] . The map is able to
witness nonclassical correlations going beyond entanglement, in a mixed
state of a bipartite quantum system. The method requires much less
experimental resources as compared to measurement of QD using full state
tomography and therefore is an attractive alternative to demonstrating
the nonclassicality of a separable state. The map implementation
involves two-qubit gates and single-qubit magnetization measurements and
can be achieved in a single experimental run using NMR. Our
implementation of the nonclassicality witness involves the sequential
measurement of different free induction decays (FIDs, corresponding to
the NMR signal) in a single run of the same experiment. This is possible
since NMR measurements are nondestructive, thus allowing sequential
measurements on the same ensemble. This feature was exploited to
implement the single-shot measurement of the map value. The NMR pulse
sequence used on Bruker Avance-III spectrometer is given Appendix- B .
Experiments were performed on a two-qubit separable state
(non-entangled) which contains nonclassical correlations. Further, the
state was allowed to freely evolve in time under natural NMR decohering
channels, and the amount of nonclassicality present was evaluated at
each time instant by calculating the map value. Results were compare
using the positive map witness with those obtained by computing the QD
via full state tomography, and a good match was obtained.

Further, it was observed that beyond a certain time, the map was not
able to detect nonclassicality, although the QD measure indicated that
nonclassicality was present in the state. This implies that while the
positive map nonclassicality witness is easy to implement experimentally
in a single experiment and is a good indicator of nonclassicality in a
separable state, it is not able to characterize nonclassicality
completely. In our case this is typified by the presence of a small
amount of QD when the state has almost decohered or when the amount of
nonclassicality present is small. This of course leaves open the
possibility of constructing a more optimal witness.

### 3.2 Experimental Detection of Non-Classical Correlation (NCC)

#### 3.2.1 Nonclassicality Witness Map Construction

For pure quantum states of a bipartite quantum system which are
represented by one-dimensional projectors @xmath in a tensor product
Hilbert space @xmath , the only type of quantum correlation is
entanglement [ 58 , 200 ] . However, for mixed states the situation is
more complex and quantum correlations can be present even if the state
is separable i.e. it is a classical mixture of separable pure states and
can be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath are positive weights and @xmath are pure states in Hilbert
spaces @xmath and @xmath respectively [ 148 ] . A separable state is
called a properly classically correlated state(PCC) if it can be written
in the form [ 50 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a joint probability distribution and @xmath and @xmath
are local orthogonal eigenbasis in local spaces @xmath and @xmath
respectively. A state that cannot be written in the form given by Eq. (
3.2 ) is called a nonclassically correlated (NCC) state. An NCC state
can be entangled or separable. The correlations in NCC states can go
beyond those present in PCC states and are due to the fact that the
eigenbasis for the respective subsystems may not be orthogonal [ 201 ] .
A typical example of a bipartite two-qubit NCC state has been discussed
in reference [ 202 ] and is given by:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath . In this case the state has no product eigenbasis as the
eigenbasis for subsystem B, since @xmath and @xmath are not orthogonal
to each other. The state is separable (not entangled) as it can be
written in the form given by Eq. ( 3.1 ); however since it is an NCC
state, it has non-trivial quantum correlations and has non-zero QD. How
to pin down the nonclassical nature of such a state with minimal
experimental effort and without actually computing QD is something that
is desirable. It has been shown that such nonclassicality witnesses can
be constructed using a positive map [ 125 ] .

The map @xmath over the state space @xmath takes a state to a real
number @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

This map is a nonclassicality witness map i.e. it is capable of
detecting NCC states in @xmath state space if and only if [ 125 ] :

-   For every bipartite state @xmath having a product eigenbasis, @xmath
    .

-   There exists at least one bipartite state @xmath (having no product
    eigenbasis) such that @xmath .

A specific non-linear nonclassicality witness map proposed by [ 125 ] is
defined in terms of expectation values of positive Hermitian operators
@xmath , @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a real number. For the case of two-qubit systems using
the operators @xmath and @xmath a nonclassicality witness map can be
obtained for state in Eq. ( 3.3 ) as:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

The value of the constant @xmath in the above witness map has to be
optimized such that for any PCC state @xmath having a product
eigenbasis, the condition @xmath holds [ 125 ] . In order to optimize
value of @xmath in Eq. 3.6 let us set @xmath with @xmath ; @xmath be any
angle and @xmath is a single qubit state. Then, @xmath is maximized for
a state written in the form of @xmath i.e.

@xmath

Further using

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with @xmath and @xmath being a complex number. @xmath is positive
requiring @xmath . So

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

After this step it is only a maximization process and the above
expression takes its maximum value when @xmath is @xmath , which results
in

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The map given by Eq. ( 3.6 ) does indeed witness the nonclassical nature
of the state @xmath as @xmath for @xmath has the value 0.25, which
suggests that the state @xmath is an NCC state [ 125 ] . The value of a
nonclassicality map, which when negative implicates the nonclassical
nature of the state, is defined as its map value (MV).

#### 3.2.2 NMR Experimental Setup For NCC Detection

In order to implemented the nonclassicality witness map @xmath on an NMR
sample of @xmath C-enriched chloroform dissolved in acetone-D6; the
@xmath H and @xmath C nuclear spins were used to encode the two qubits
(see Fig. 3.1 for experimental parameters). Unitary operations were
implemented by specially crafted transverse radio frequency pulses of
suitable amplitude, phase and duration. Since a heteronuclear @xmath H-
@xmath C spin system was used to encode the qubits, standard pulse
calibration methods available on the dedicated NMR spectrometer software
were used for pulse optimization and gave accurate results. A sequence
of spin-selective pulses interspersed with tailored free evolution
periods were used to prepare the system in an NCC state as described
below, written using spin-angular momentum operators:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

One can begin with the system in thermal equilibrium and ignore the
identity part of the density matrix, which does not evolve under RF
(radio frequency) pulses. The RF pulses @xmath are written above each
arrow, with @xmath denoting the pulse flip angle, @xmath denoting the
qubit on which the pulse is being applied and @xmath being the axis
along

which the pulse is applied. Spatial averaging (denoted by Sp. Av.) is
achieved via a dephasing z-gradient. The NMR spectra of the thermal
state and the prepared NCC state are shown in Fig. 3.1 (b), and the
corresponding pulse sequence is depicted in Fig. 3.2 (b).

The quantum circuit to implement the nonclassicality witness map is
shown in Fig. 3.2 (a). The first module represents NCC state preparation
using the pulses as already described. The circuit to capture
nonclassicality of the prepared state consists of a controlled-Hadamard
(CH) gate, followed by measurement on both qubits, a CNOT gate and
finally detection on ‘Qubit 2’. The CH gate is analogous to a CNOT gate,
with a Hadamard gate being implemented on the target qubit if the
control qubit is in the state @xmath and a ‘no-operation’ if the control
qubit is in the state @xmath . The NMR pulse sequence corresponding to
the quantum circuit is depicted in Fig. 3.2 (b). The set of pulses
grouped under the label ‘State prep.’ convert the thermal equilibrium
state to the desired NCC state. A dephasing z-gradient is applied on the
gradient channel to kill undesired coherences. After a delay @xmath
followed by the pulse sequence to implement the CH gate, the
magnetizations of both qubits were measured with @xmath readout pulses
(not shown in the figure). In the last part of detection circuit a CNOT
gate is applied followed by a magnetization measurement of ‘Qubit 2’;
the scalar coupling time interval was set to @xmath where J is the
strength of the scalar coupling between the qubits. Refocusing pulses
were used during all J-evolution to compensate for unwanted chemical
shift evolution during the selective pulses. State fidelity was computed
using the Uhlmann-Jozsa measure [ 171 , 172 ] (also see Eq. ( 2.7 )),
and the NCC state was prepared with a fidelity of 0.97 @xmath 0.02.

To detect the nonclassicality in the prepared NCC state via the map
@xmath , the expectation values of the operators @xmath and @xmath are
required. Re-working the map brings it to the following form [ 125 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath are the magnetizations of ‘Qubit 1’ and ‘Qubit
2’ after a CH gate on the input state @xmath , while @xmath is the
magnetization of ‘Qubit 2’ after a CNOT gate. The theoretically expected
normalized values of @xmath , @xmath and @xmath for state @xmath are
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath respectively. Map value (MV) is @xmath and as
desired this map does indeed witness the presence of nonclassicality.
The experimentally computed MV for the prepared NCC state turns out to
be @xmath , proving that the map is indeed able to witness the
nonclassicality present in the state.

#### 3.2.3 Map Value Dynamics

The prepared NCC state was allowed to evolve freely in time and the MV
calculated at each time instant, in order to characterize the
decoherence dynamics of the nonclassicality witness map. As
theoretically expected, one should get a negative MV for states which
are NCC. MV was measured at time instants which were integral multiples
of @xmath i.e. @xmath (with @xmath = 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 20,
25, 30, 35, 40, 45 and 50), in order to avoid experimental errors due to
J-evolution. The results of experimental MV dynamics as a function of
time are shown in Fig. 3.3 (a). Experiments were repeated eight times to
estimate the errors as depicted in the figure. As seen from Fig. 3.3
(a), the MV remains negative (indicating the state is NCC) for up-to 120
ms, which is approximately the @xmath H transverse relaxation time. The
standard NMR decoherence mechanisms are denoted by T @xmath the
spin-spin relaxation time which causes dephasing among the energy
eigenstates and T @xmath the spin-lattice relaxation time, which causes
energy exchange between the spins and their environment. For comparison,
the MV was also calculated directly using Eq. ( 3.6 ) with @xmath , from
the state which was tomographically reconstructed at each time instant
via full state tomography [ 41 ] . The results are shown in Fig. 3.3
(b), which are in good agreement with direct experimental MV
measurements. The state fidelity was also computed at the different time
instants and the results are shown in Fig. 3.3 (c). The red squares in
Fig. 3.3 (c) represent state fidelity of the experimental state @xmath
evolving in time, w.r.t. the theoretical NCC state @xmath at time @xmath
given in Eq. ( 3.3 ).

#### 3.2.4 Quantum Discord Dynamics

Map value evaluation of nonclassicality was also compared with the
standard measure of nonclassicality, namely QD [ 122 , 203 ] . The state
was reconstructed by peRForming full quantum state tomography and the QD
measure was computed from the experimental data. Quantum mutual
information can be quantified by the equations:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.8)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the conditional von Neumann entropy of subsystem @xmath
when @xmath has already been measured. QD is defined as the minimum
difference between the two formulations of mutual information in Eq. (
3.8 ):

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

QD hence depends on projectors @xmath . The state of the system, after
the outcome corresponding to projector @xmath has been detected, is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

with the probability @xmath ; @xmath is identity operator on subsystem
B. The state of the system B, after this measurement is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

@xmath is the missing information about B before measurement @xmath .
The expression

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

is the conditional entropy appearing in Eq. ( 3.9 ). In order to capture
the true quantumness of the correlation one needs to peRForm an
optimization over all sets of von-Neumann type measurements represented
by the projectors @xmath . One can define two orthogonal vectors (for
spin half quantum subsystems), characterized by two real parameters
@xmath and @xmath , on the Bloch sphere as:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (3.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

These vectors can be used to construct the projectors @xmath , which are
then used to find out the state of B after an arbitrary measurement was
made on subsystem A. The definition of conditional entropy (Eq. ( 3.12
)) can be used to obtain an expression which is parameterized by @xmath
and @xmath for a given state @xmath . This expression is finally
minimized by varying @xmath and @xmath and the results fed back into
Eq. ( 3.9 ), which yields a measure of QD independent of the basis
chosen for the measurement of the subsystem.

To compare the detection via the positive map method with the standard
QD measure, the state was let evolve for a time @xmath and then
reconstructed the experimentally prepared via full quantum state
tomography and calculated the QD at all time instants where the MV was
determined experimentally (the results are shown in Fig. 3.3 (d)). At
@xmath = 0 s, a non-zero QD confirms the presence of NCC and verifies
the results given by MV. As the state evolves with time, the QD
parameter starts decreasing rapidly, in accordance with increasing MV.
Beyond 120 ms, while the MV becomes positive and hence fails to detect
nonclassicality, the QD parameter remains non-zero, indicating the
presence of some amount of nonclassicality (although by this time the
state fidelity has decreased to 0.7). However, value of QD is very close
to zero and in fact cannot be distinguished from contributions due to
noise. One can hence conclude that the positive map suffices to detect
nonclassicality when decoherence processes have not set in and while the
fidelity of the prepared state is good. Once the state has decohered
however, a measure such as QD has to be used to verify if the degraded
state retains some amount of nonclassical correlations or not. While the
constructed nonclassicality witness is not optimal and hence cannot be
quantitatively compared with a stricter measure of nonclassicality such
as a measurement of the QD parameter, in most cases the witness suffices
to detect the presence of nonclassicality in a quantum state without
having to resort to more complicated experimental schemes.

### 3.3 Conclusions

In the work described in this chapter, nonclassical correlations were
detected experimentally in a separable two-qubit quantum state, using a
nonlinear positive map as a nonclassicality witness. The witness is able
to detect nonclassicality and its obvious advantage lies in its using
much fewer experimental resources as compared to quantifying
nonclassicality by measuring quantum discord via full quantum state
tomography. It will be interesting to construct and utilize this map in
higher-dimensional quantum systems and for multi-qubits, where it is
more challenging to distinguish between classical and quantum
correlations. It has been posited that quantum correlations, which can
go beyond quantum entanglement (and are captured by quantum discord and
can thus be present even in separable states), are responsible for
achieving computational speedup in quantum algorithms. It is important
from the point of view of quantum information processing, to confirm the
presence of such correlations in a quantum state, without having to
expend too much experimental effort. The work described in this chapter
is a step forward in this direction. Results of this chapter are
contained in Phys. Rev. A 95 , 062318 (2017) .

## Chapter 4 Experimental Classification of Entanglement in Arbitrary
Three-Qubit States

### 4.1 Introduction

This chapter extends the goal of entanglement detection from a bipartite
scenario, reported in Chapter 2 , to multipartite case. Experimental
characterization of arbitrary three-qubit pure states is undertaken. The
three-qubit states can be classified into six inequivalent classes [ 73
] under SLOCC [ 204 ] . Protocols have been invented to carry out the
classification of three-qubit states into the SLOCC classes [ 205 , 206
] . A recent proposal [ 207 ] aims to classify any three-qubit pure
entangled state into these six inequivalent classes by measuring only
four observables. Previously constructed scheme [ 157 ] to
experimentally realize a canonical form for general three-qubit states,
is used to prepare arbitrary three-qubit states with an unknown amount
of entanglement. Experimental implementation of the entanglement
detection protocol is such that a single-shot (using only four
experimental settings) is able to determine if a state belongs to the
@xmath class or to the @xmath class. Schemes are devised to map the
desired observables onto the @xmath -magnetization of one of the
subsystems, making it possible to experimentally measure its expectation
value on NMR systems [ 42 ] . Mapping of the observables onto Pauli
@xmath -operators of a single qubit eases the experimental determination
of the desired expectation value, since the NMR signal is proportional
to the ensemble average of the Pauli @xmath -operator.

The protocol has been tested on known three-qubit entangled states such
as the @xmath state and the @xmath state as well as on randomly
generated arbitrary three-qubit states with an unknown amount of
entanglement. Seven representative states belonging to the six SLOCC
inequivalent classes as well as twenty random states were prepared
experimentally, with state fidelities ranging between 89% to 99%. To
decide the entanglement class of a state, the expectation values of four
observables were experimentally measured in the state under
investigation. All the seven representative states (namely, GHZ, W,
@xmath , three bi-separable states and a separable state) were
successfully detected within the experimental error limits. Using this
protocol, the experimentally randomly generated arbitrary three-qubit
states were correctly identified as belonging to either the GHZ, the W,
the bi-separable or the separable class of states. Full quantum state
tomography is performed to directly compute the observable value.
Reconstructed density matrices were used to calculate the entanglement
by computing negativity in each case, and the results compared well with
those of the current protocol.

### 4.2 Detecting Tripartite Entanglement

There are six SLOCC inequivalent classes of entanglement in three-qubit
systems, namely, the GHZ, W, three different biseparable classes and the
separable class [ 73 ] . A widely used measure of entanglement is the
@xmath -tangle [ 208 , 209 ] and a non-vanishing three-tangle is a
signature of the GHZ entangled class and can hence be used for their
detection. For three parties A, B and C, the three-tangle @xmath is
defined as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath and @xmath being the concurrence that characterizes
entanglement between A and B, and between A and C respectively; @xmath
denotes the concurrence between A and the joint state of the subsystem
comprising B and C [ 120 ] . It was shown [ 120 ] that for a pure state
of form @xmath with @xmath the quadratic expression in concurrence can
be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

with

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

The idea of using the three-tangle to investigate entanglement in
three-qubit generic states is particularly interesting and general, as
any three-qubit pure state can be written in the canonical form [ 210 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , and the class of states is written in
the computational basis @xmath of the qubits. On comparing the
coefficients of general three-qubit pure state, @xmath with the generic
state @xmath one can observe that @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath and hence can compute @xmath in Eq. ( 4.2 ). On using resulting
@xmath in Eq. ( 4.2 ) the three-tangle for the generic state Eq. ( 4.4 )
turns out to be [ 207 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

Three-tangle can be measured experimentally by measuring the expectation
value of the operator @xmath , in the three-qubit state @xmath . Here
@xmath are the Pauli matrices and @xmath denotes qubits label and the
tensor product symbol between the Pauli operators has been omitted for
brevity. One can compute

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

and this results in @xmath . A non-zero expectation value of @xmath
implies that the state under investigation is in the GHZ class [ 73 ] .
In order to further categorize the classes of three-qubit generic states
three more observables are defined as @xmath , @xmath , @xmath .
Experimentally measuring the expectation values of the operators @xmath
, @xmath , @xmath and @xmath can reveal the entanglement class of every
three-qubit pure state [ 206 , 207 ] . Table 4.1 summarizes the
classification of the six SLOCC inequivalent classes of entangled states
based on the expectation values of the observables @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath .

The six SLOCC inequivalent classes of three-qubit entangled states are
GHZ, W, BS @xmath , BS @xmath , BS @xmath and separable. While GHZ and W
classes are well known, BS @xmath denotes a biseparable class having B
and C subsystems entangled, the BS @xmath class has subsystems A and C
entangled, while the BS @xmath class has subsystems A and B entangled.
As has been summarized in Table 4.1 a non-zero value of @xmath indicates
that the state is in the GHZ class and this expectation value is zero
for all other classes. For the W class of states all @xmath are non-zero
except @xmath . For the BS @xmath class only @xmath is non-zero while
only @xmath , and @xmath are non-zero for the classes BS @xmath and BS
@xmath , respectively. For separable states all expectations are zero.

In order to experimentally realize the entanglement characterization
protocol, one has to determine the expectation values @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath for an experimentally prepared state @xmath . Next
section describes the method to experimentally realize these expectation
values based on subsystem measurement of the Pauli @xmath -operator [ 42
] and scheme for generating arbitrary three-qubit states [ 157 ] .

#### 4.2.1 Mapping Pauli basis operators to single-qubit
@xmath-operators

A standard way to determine the expectation value of a desired
observable in an experiment is to decompose the observable as a linear
superposition of the observables accessible in the experiment [ 7 ] .
This task becomes particularly accessible while dealing with the Pauli
basis. Any observable for a three-qubit system, acting on an
eight-dimensional Hilbert space can be decomposed as a linear
superposition of 64 basis operators, and the Pauli basis is one possible
basis for this decomposition. Let the set of Pauli basis operators be
denoted as @xmath . For example, @xmath has the form @xmath and it is
the element B @xmath of the basis set @xmath . The four observables
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are represented by the elements B
@xmath , B @xmath , B @xmath and B @xmath respectively of the Pauli
basis set @xmath . Also by this convention the single-qubit @xmath
-operators for the first, second and third qubit i.e. @xmath , @xmath
and @xmath are the elements B @xmath , B @xmath and B @xmath
respectively.

Table 4.2 details the mapping of all 63 Pauli basis operators (excluding
the 8 @xmath 8 identity operator) to the single-qubit Pauli @xmath
-operator. This mapping is particularly useful in an experimental setup
where the expectation values of Pauli local @xmath -operators are easily
accessible. In NMR experiments, the @xmath -magnetization of a nuclear
spin in a state is proportional to the expectation value of Pauli @xmath
-operator of that spin in the state.

As an example of the mapping given in Table 4.2 , the operator @xmath
has the form @xmath and is the element B @xmath of basis set @xmath . In
order to determine @xmath in the state @xmath , one can map the state
@xmath with @xmath @xmath . This is followed by finding @xmath in the
state @xmath . The expectation value @xmath in the state @xmath is
equivalent to the expectation value of @xmath in the state @xmath (Table
4.2 ); the operation @xmath is a controlled-NOT gate with @xmath as the
control qubit and @xmath as the target qubit, and @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath represent local @xmath unitary rotations with phases
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath respectively. The subscript on
@xmath local unitary rotations denotes qubit number. The quantum circuit
to achieve such a mapping is shown in Fig. 4.1 (a).

It should be noted that while measuring the expectation values of @xmath
, @xmath , @xmath or @xmath , all the @xmath local rotations may not act
in all these four cases. The mapping given in Table 4.2 is used to
decide which @xmath local rotation in the circuit 4.1 (a) will act. All
the basis operators in set @xmath can be mapped to single-qubit @xmath
-operators in a similar fashion. The mapping given in Table 4.2 is not
unique and there are several equivalent mappings which can be worked out
as per the experimental requirements.

### 4.3 NMR Implementation of Three-Qubit Entanglement Detection
Protocol

The Hamiltonian [ 28 ] for a three-qubit system in the rotating frame is
given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the indices @xmath 1,2 or 3 represent the qubit number and @xmath
is the respective chemical shift in rotating frame, @xmath is the scalar
coupling constant and @xmath is the Pauli @xmath -spin angular momentum
operator of the @xmath qubit. To implement the entanglement detection
protocol experimentally, @xmath C labeled diethylfluoromalonate
dissolved in acetone-D6 sample was used. @xmath H, @xmath F and @xmath C
spin-half nuclei were encoded as qubit 1, qubit 2 and qubit 3
respectively. The system was initialized in the pseudopure (PPS) state
i.e. @xmath using the spatial averaging [ 36 , 211 ] with the density
operator being

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the thermal polarization at room temperature and @xmath
is the 8 @xmath 8 identity operator. The experimentally determined NMR
parameters (chemical shifts, T @xmath and T @xmath relaxation times and
scalar couplings @xmath ) as well as the NMR spectra of the PPS state
are shown in Fig. 4.2 . Each spectral transition is labeled with the
logical states of the passive qubits ( i.e. qubits not undergoing any
transition) in the computational basis. The state fidelity of the
experimentally prepared PPS (Fig. 4.2 (c)) was compute to be 0.98 @xmath
0.01 and was calculated using the fidelity measure [ 171 , 172 ] (also
see Eqn. 2.7 ). For the experimental reconstruction of density operator,
full quantum state tomography (QST) [ 41 , 212 ] was performed using a
preparatory pulse set @xmath , where @xmath implies “no operation”. In
NMR a @xmath local unitary rotation @xmath ( @xmath ) can be achieved
using spin-selective transverse radio frequency (RF) pulses having phase
@xmath ( @xmath ).

Experiments were performed at room temperature ( @xmath K) on a Bruker
Avance III 600-MHz FT-NMR spectrometer equipped with a QXI probe. Local
unitary operations were achieved using highly accurate and calibrated
spin selective transverse RF pulses of suitable amplitude, phase and
duration. Non-local unitary operation were achieved by free evolution
under the system Hamiltonian Eq. ( 4.7 ), of suitable duration under the
desired scalar coupling with the help of embedded @xmath refocusing
pulses. In the current study, the durations of @xmath pulses for @xmath
H, @xmath F and @xmath C were 9.55 @xmath s at 18.14 W power level,
22.80 @xmath s at a power level of 42.27 W and 15.50 @xmath s at a power
level of 179.47 W, respectively.

#### 4.3.1 Measuring Observables by Mapping to Local
@xmath-Magnetization

As discussed in Sec. 4.2.1 , the observables required to differentiate
between six inequivalent classes of three-qubit pure entangled states
can be mapped to the Pauli @xmath -operator of one of the qubits.
Further, in NMR the observed @xmath -magnetization of a nuclear spin in
a quantum state is proportional to the expectation value of @xmath
-operator [ 28 ] of the spin in that state. The time-domain NMR signal
i.e. the free induction decay with appropriate phase gives Lorentzian
peaks when Fourier transformed. These normalized experimental
intensities give an estimate of the expectation value of @xmath of the
quantum state.

Let @xmath be the observable whose expectation value is to be measured
in a state @xmath . Instead of measuring @xmath , the state @xmath can
be mapped to @xmath using @xmath followed by @xmath -magnetization
measurement of one of the qubits. Table 4.2 lists the explicit forms of
@xmath for all the basis elements of the Pauli basis set @xmath . In the
present study, the observables of interest are @xmath , @xmath , @xmath
and @xmath as described in Sec. 4.2.1 and Table 4.1 . The quantum
circuit to achieve the required mapping is shown in Fig. 4.1 (a). The
circuit is designed to map the state @xmath to either of the states
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath or @xmath followed by a @xmath measurement on
the third qubit in the mapped state. Depending upon the experimental
settings, @xmath in the mapped states is indeed the expectation values
of @xmath , @xmath , @xmath or @xmath in the initial state @xmath . The
NMR pulse sequence to achieve the quantum mapping of circuit in Fig. 4.1
(a) is shown in Fig. 4.1 (b). The unfilled rectangles represent @xmath
spin-selective pulses while the filled rectangles represent @xmath
pulses. Evolution under chemical shifts has been refocused during all
the free evolution periods (denoted by @xmath ) and @xmath pulses are
embedded in between the free evolution periods in such a way that the
system evolves only under the desired scalar coupling @xmath .

#### 4.3.2 Implementing the Entanglement Detection Protocol

The three-qubit system was prepared in twenty seven different states in
order to experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of the entanglement
detection protocol. Seven representative states were prepared from the
six inequivalent entanglement classes i.e. GHZ (GHZ and @xmath states),
W, three bi-separable and a separable class of states. In addition,
twenty generic states were randomly generated (labeled as R @xmath , R
@xmath , R @xmath ,……., R @xmath ). To prepare the random states the
MATLAB ^(®) -2016a random number generator was used. A recent
experimental scheme [ 157 ] was utilized to prepare the generic
three-qubit states. For the details of quantum circuits as well as NMR
pulse sequences used for state preparation see [ 157 ] . All the
prepared states had state fidelities ranging between 0.89 to 0.99. Each
prepared state @xmath was passed through the detection circuit 4.1 (a)
to yield the expectation values of the observables @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath as described in Sec. 4.3.1 . Further, full QST [ 36 ]
was performed to directly estimate the expectation value of @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath for all the twenty seven states. The results
of the experimental implementation of the three-qubit entanglement
detection protocol are tabulated in Table 4.4 . For a visual
representation of the data in Table 4.4 , bar charts have been plotted
and are shown in Fig. 4.3 . The seven known states were numbered as 1-7
while twenty random states were numbered as 8-27 in accordance with
Table 4.4 . Horizontal axes in plots of Fig. 4.3 denote the state number
while vertical axes represent the value of the respective observable.
Black, cross-hatched and unfilled bars represent theoretical (The.),
direct (Dir.) experimental and QST based expectation values,
respectively. To further quantify the entanglement quotient, the
entanglement measure, negativity [ 213 , 118 ] was also computed
theoretically as well as experimentally in all the cases (Table 4.3 ).
Experiments were repeated several times for error estimation and to
validate the reproducibility of the experimental results. All the seven
representative states belonging to the six inequivalent entanglement
classes were detected successfully within the experimental error limits,
as suggested by the experimental results in first seven rows of Table
4.4 in comparison with Table 4.1 . The errors in the experimental
expectation values reported in the Table 4.4 were in the range
3.1%-8.5%. The entanglement detection protocol with only four
observables is further supported by negativity measurements (Table 4.3
). It is to be noted here that one will never be able to conclude that
the result of an experimental observation is exactly zero. However it
can be established that the result is non-zero. This has to be kept in
mind while interpreting the experimentally obtained values of the
operators involved via the decision Table 4.1 .

The results for the twenty randomly generated generic states, numbered
from 8-27 (R @xmath -R @xmath ), are interesting. For instance, states R
@xmath and R @xmath have a negativity of approximately 0.35 which
implies that these states have genuine tripartite entanglement. On the
other hand the experimental results of current detection protocol (Table
4.4 ) suggest that R @xmath has a nonzero 3-tangle, which is a signature
of the GHZ class. The states R @xmath , R @xmath , R @xmath , R @xmath ,
R @xmath , R @xmath and R @xmath also belong to the GHZ class as they
all have non-zero 3-tangle as well as finite negativity. On the other
hand, the state R @xmath has a vanishing 3-tangle with non-vanishing
expectation values of @xmath , @xmath and @xmath which indicates that
this state belongs to the W class. The states R @xmath , R @xmath and R
@xmath were also identified as members of the W class using the
detection protocol. These results demonstrate the fine-grained state
discrimination power of the entanglement detection protocol as compared
to procedures that rely on QST.

Furthermore, all vanishing expectation values as well as a near-zero
negativity, in the case of R @xmath state, imply that it belongs to the
separable class. The randomly generated states R @xmath , R @xmath , R
@xmath , R @xmath and R @xmath have also been identified as belonging to
the separable class of states. Interestingly, R @xmath has vanishing
values of 3-tangle, negativity, @xmath and @xmath but has a finite value
of @xmath , from which one can conclude that this state belongs to the
bi-separable BS @xmath class.

### 4.4 Generalized Three-Qubit Pure State Entanglement Classification

Above experimental demonstration [ 43 ] of the three-qubit entanglement
classification scheme [ 207 ] is limited to five-parameter generic
state, Eq. ( 4.4 ) [ 210 ] . As two different three-qubit pure states of
form @xmath can have same generic state representation [ 210 ] . In
order to detect and classify the entanglement in generalized three-qubit
pure states the proposal in Ref. [ 146 ] is explored. For the
experimental demonstration concurrence [ 115 , 214 , 215 ] based
entanglement classification protocol [ 146 ] is investigated. Core of
the experimental procedure followed here depends upon finding the
expectation value of a desired Pauli operators efficiently and to
achieve this, the schemes described in Refs. [ 42 , 216 , 43 ] were
utilized. Further, experimental procedures [ 157 ] were developed to
prepare any desired three-qubit generic states and used it in the
current study to prepare states with arbitrary entanglement quotient.

Consider a three-qubit pure state @xmath . The state is fully separable
if one can write @xmath . In case @xmath is biseparable under
bipartition @xmath then it is always possible to write @xmath where
second and third qubits are in an entangled state @xmath . Similarly one
many have other two bipartitions as @xmath and @xmath . In case @xmath
can not be written as a fully separable or biseparable then the state is
genuinely entangled. There are two SLOCC inequivalent classes of genuine
three-qubit entanglement [ 73 ] namely, GHZ and W class. Hence any
three-qubit pure state can belong to either of the six SLOCC
inequivalent classes i.e. GHZ, W, three different biseparable classes or
separable [ 73 ] .

Following is the outline of the procedure [ 146 ] for generalized
three-qubit pure state entanglement classification. Entanglement measure
concurrence [ 115 , 214 , 215 ] is utilized to identify the above
mentioned biseparable states in three-qubit pure states. The most
general three-qubit pure state can be written as @xmath with @xmath .
Concurrence for state @xmath is given by @xmath where @xmath being the
reduced density operator of first party. Squared concurrence for a
three-qubit pure state under bipartiton @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

Further it was shown in [ 146 ] that after a lengthy calculation the
squared concurrence, Eq. ( 4.9 ), can be written as a quadratic
polynomial of the expectation values of Pauli operators for three spin
system. Let us symbolize @xmath as @xmath and it takes the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.10)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

with @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath being Pauli spin matrices in
computational basis. Similar expressions for squared concurrences under
other two bipartitions i.e. @xmath and @xmath can also be written by
permutation and symbolized by @xmath and @xmath respectively [ 146 ] .

As described in Theorem 1 of [ 146 ] , for any three-qubit pure state
@xmath ,

(i) @xmath is fully separable iff @xmath , for @xmath or @xmath or
@xmath .

(ii) @xmath is separable between l @xmath qubit and rest iff @xmath and
@xmath with @xmath and @xmath .

(iii) @xmath is genuinely entangled iff @xmath , for @xmath or @xmath or
@xmath .

Hence computing the nonlinear entanglement witnesses @xmath , through
experimentally measured expectation values of Pauli operators in an
arbitrary three-qubit pure state @xmath , can immediately reveal the
entanglement class of the state.

#### 4.4.1 Framework for Experimental Implementation

Experimental creation of arbitrary general three-qubit pure states is a
non-trivial task but one can resort to generic state [ 210 ] for the
demonstration of above discussed entanglement classification protocol.

It has been established [ 210 ] that any three-qubit pure state can be
transformed to generic state of canonical form 4.4 . The idea of five
parameter generic state representation of three-qubit states was
motivated from two-qubit generic states utilizing Schmidt decomposition
[ 217 , 218 ] where any two-qubit state was shown to have form @xmath
with @xmath , the relative phase has been absorbed into any of the local
bases. Although the three-qubit generic representation doesn’t follow
from Schmidt decomposition but it was shown that combining adequately
the local changes of bases corresponding to U(1) @xmath U(3) @xmath
SU(2) @xmath SU(2) @xmath SU(2) transformations, one can always do with
five terms, which precisely can carry only five entanglement parameters,
leading thus to a non-superfluous unique representation.

It should be noted that the entanglement classification procedure
outlined in Sec 4.2 works for any three-qubit pure state but arbitrary
generic states were chosen for experimental demonstration. Two or more
different states may have same generic canonical representation [ 210 ]
. Entanglement properties for the class of all such states can be fully
characterized resorting only to the SLOCC equivalent generic state
representative of that class. Such choice of states further ease the
experimental efforts as nearly 40% of the expectation values of Pauli
operators appearing in the expressions of @xmath ( e.g. Eq. ( 4.10 ))
vanish in the case of generic states (Eq. ( 4.4 )). In the recent work [
216 ] discussed in the previous sections, the entanglement
classification of arbitrary three-qubit pure states was experimentally
demonstrated. To do so only four observables suffice to classify the
entanglement class. In contrast, the current classification works not
only for generic states but also for any arbitrary three-qubit pure
state of form @xmath and not limited to the canonical form 4.4 .

Further, as per Theorem 1 -(iii) the current entanglement classification
protocol enables us to decide if a given pure state has genuine
three-qubit entanglement or not but doesn’t say anything if state
belongs to GHZ or W class. To overcome this an observable is defined as
@xmath and use @xmath -tangle [ 208 , 209 ] as an entanglement measure.
For a three-qubit system, a non-vanishing 3-tangle, @xmath , implies it
belongs to GHZ class. One may easily verify that for a given generic
state @xmath , the 3-tangle i.e. @xmath , Eq. ( 4.6 ). Having defined
@xmath in addition to @xmath , the protocol is equipped to
experimentally classify any three-qubit pure state.

### 4.5 NMR Implementation of Generalized Three-Qubit Entanglement
Classification Protocol

To experimentally implement the entanglement classification protocol
discussed in Sec. 4.4 the experimental setup discussed in Sec. 4.2.1 -
4.3 is used. Three-qubit system is prepared in twenty seven different
states. Seven states were prepared from the six SLOCC inequivalent
entanglement classes i.e. GHZ (GHZ and @xmath states), W, three
bi-separable and a separable class of states. Three biseparable class
states under partitions @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are labeled as BS
@xmath , BS @xmath and BS @xmath respectively. Additionally, twenty
random generic states were prepared and labeled as R @xmath , R @xmath ,
R @xmath ,……., R @xmath . To prepare the random states the random number
generator available at www.random.org was used. To experimentally
prepare the desired three-qubit generic state, procedure outlined in [
157 ] is followed. Ref. [ 157 ] details the quantum circuits as well as
NMR pulse sequences required to prepare all the desired quantum states
in the current study. All such prepared states were found to have the
fidelity (F) in the range 0.88 to 0.99. For each such prepared state the
expectation values of the Pauli operators were found as described in
Sec. 4.3.1 which in turn were used to compute @xmath using Eq. ( 4.10 ).
@xmath was also found in all the cases as it serves as an entanglement
witness of the GHZ class.

Experimental results of the three-qubit entanglement classification and
detection protocol are shown in Table 4.5 . A bar chart has been plotted
in Fig. 4.4 for a visual representation of the experimental results of
Table 4.5 . To obtain the bar plots of Fig. 4.4 , the experimentally
prepared states were numbered from 1 to 27 as per the order shown in
Table 4.5 . As detailed in Sec. 4.2 , the concurrence @xmath acts as the
entanglement witness and the additional observable @xmath helps in the
experimental discrimination of GHZ class states from rest of the states.
In order to further validate the results negativity [ 213 , 118 ] has
been computed from experimentally reconstructed state via QST [ 41 ] and
the results are shown in the Table 4.6 . In each case experiments were
repeated several times for experimental error estimates. Experimental
errors were in the range of 2.2% - 5.7% for the values reported in the
Table 4.5 .

One may observe from Table 4.5 that the seven states, from six SLOCC
inequivalent classes, were prepared with experimental fidelity @xmath
0.95. The entanglement classes of all these seven states were correctly
identified with the current protocol. It may further be noted that the
states R @xmath , R @xmath , R @xmath , R @xmath , R @xmath , R @xmath ,
R @xmath , R @xmath , R @xmath , R @xmath , R @xmath , R @xmath , R
@xmath and R @xmath have two non-zero concurrences and hence are all
genuinely entangled states. This fact is further supported by negativity
of these states reported in Table 4.6 . As discussed earlier, in order
to discriminate GHZ class from the rest one can resort to the observable
@xmath . Non-vanishing values of @xmath in Table 4.5 imply that the
states R @xmath , R @xmath , R @xmath , R @xmath , R @xmath , R @xmath ,
R @xmath , R @xmath , R @xmath and R @xmath belong to GHZ class. In
contrast genuinely entangled states R @xmath , R @xmath , R @xmath and R
@xmath have vanishing values of @xmath and hence have vanishing 3-tangle
as well so they were identified as W class members. States R @xmath and
R @xmath have the vanishing concurrence @xmath implying that state
belong to BS @xmath class. Also states R @xmath , R @xmath , R @xmath
and R @xmath were identified as separable as all the observables have
near zero values as well as zero negativity.

### 4.6 Effect of Mixedness in the Prepared States

While the proposed entanglement classification protocol assumes the
state under investigation to be pure, the experimentally prepared states
are invariably mixed. The experimentally prepared density operator
@xmath can be expanded in terms of its eigenvalues @xmath and
corresponding eigenvectors @xmath as @xmath , obeying the normalization
condition @xmath . For a pure state @xmath , only one of the eigenvalue
can be non-zero, hence one can take @xmath and other eigenvalues to be
zero. The expectation value of the observable @xmath can then be written
as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

In an actual experiment the situation is different and several
eigenvalues of the density operator may be non-zero. The errors can
arise either from the mixedness present in the experimentally prepared
state @xmath or in the experimental measurement of @xmath . These errors
are dominantly caused by imperfections in the unitary rotations used in
state preparation, rf inhomogeneity of the applied magnetic field, as
well as T @xmath and T @xmath decoherence processes.

Let @xmath be the maximum eigenvalue of the experimentally prepared
state @xmath . Mixedness is indicated by non-zero eigenvalues @xmath for
@xmath . The expectation value of @xmath can be written as an equation
similar to Eq. ( 4.11 ).

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

The question is that if one approximate the state to be a pure state
corresponding to the largest eigenvalue @xmath and take @xmath , how
much error is introduced and how do these errors affect the results.

In order to estimate the error in the value of @xmath due to the
mixedness, one can define the fractional error as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath s depend upon the operator involved. The experimental
states have a minimum @xmath while @xmath in other cases. In case of all
the four observables @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , @xmath was
computed for all the 27 experimentally prepared states and the obtained
values as percentage error were in the range 1.1% @xmath 9.3%.

In the light of the errors introduced by the mixedness present in the
experimentally prepared states the detection protocol has to take @xmath
error values into consideration in addition to the experimental errors
reported in the Table 4.4 for deciding the class of three-qubit
entanglement. As is evident from the above analysis, in the worst-case
scenario the protocol works 90% of the time. To further increase the
fidelity of the protocol, one can repeat the entire scheme on the same
prepared state, a number of times.

### 4.7 Conclusions

This chapter is aimed at the experimental classification of arbitrary
three-qubit pure states. To accomplish the goal two different strategies
were followed. In the first classification protocol only four observable
were defined and measured experimentally for the classification. In the
second case, the entanglement measure concurrence was measured
experimentally to detect the class of three-qubit pure states. Former
protocol has the limitation that it can only classify the entanglement
class of the states in generic form while the later is capable of
detecting the entanglement class of any arbitrary three-qubit pure
state. All the representative states from six SLOCC inequivalent classes
were detected by both the protocols. Detection/classification protocols
were further used to detect the entanglement class of twenty randomly
generated three-qubit pure states and both the protocols correctly
identified the entanglement class within the experimental error limits.
Results were further verified and substantiated by full quantum state
tomography as well as negativity calculations which indeed confirms the
results obtained by both the protocols. Results of this chapter are
contained in Phys. Rev. A 98 , 032301 (2018) and Quant. Info. Proc. 17 ,

## Chapter 5 Detection of Qubit-Ququart Pseudo-Bound Entanglement

### 5.1 Introduction

This chapter details the experimental investigations of a special type
of entanglement which is fundamentally different from the entanglement
we usually encounter in QIP. Entanglement exists in two fundamentally
different forms [ 103 , 102 ] : “free” entanglement which can be
distilled into EPR pairs using local operations and classical
communications (LOCC) [ 219 ] and “bound” entanglement which cannot be
distilled into EPR pairs via LOCC, as discussed in Sec-( 1.4.3 ) . The
term “bound” essentially implies that although correlations were
established during the state preparation, they cannot brought into a
“free” form in terms of EPR pairs by a distillation process, and used
wherever EPR pairs can be used as a resource. PPT entangled states are a
prime example of bound entangled states and have been shown to be useful
to establish a secret key [ 220 ] , in the conversion of pure entangled
states [ 221 ] and for quantum secure communication [ 222 ] . While the
existence of “bound” entangled states has been proved beyond doubt,
there are still only a few known classes of such states [ 103 , 223 ,
210 , 224 ] . The problem of finding all such PPT entangled states is
still unsolved at the theoretical level.

Experimentally, bound entanglement has been created using four-qubit
polarization states [ 225 , 226 ] and entanglement unlocking of a
four-qubit bound entangled state was also demonstrated [ 227 ] .
Entanglement was characterized in bit-flip and phase-flip lossless
quantum channel and the experiments were able to differentiate between
free entangled, bound-entangled and separable states [ 228 ] .
Continuous variable photonic bound-state entanglement has been created
and detected in various experiments [ 229 , 230 , 231 ] . Two photon
qutrit Bound-entangled states of two qutrits were investigated utilizing
orbital angular momentum degrees of freedom [ 232 ] . In NMR, a
three-qubit system was used to prepare a three-parameter pseudo-bound
entangled state [ 233 ] .

In the work described in this chapter, experiments were performed to
create and characterize a one-parameter family of qubit-ququart PPT
entangled states using three nuclear spins on an NMR quantum information
processor. There are a few proposals to detect PPT entanglement in the
class of states introduced in Reference [ 103 ] by exploring local sum
uncertainties [ 146 ] and by measuring individual spin magnetisation
along different directions [ 234 ] . The proposal of Ref. [ 234 ] is
implemented to experimentally detect PPT entanglement in states prepared
on an NMR quantum information processor. The family of states considered
in the current study is an incoherent mixture of five pure states and
the relative strengths of the components of the mixture is controlled by
a real parameter. Different PPT-entangled states were prepared
experimentally, parameterized by a real parameter. These states
represent five points on the one-parameter family of states. Discrete
values of the real parameter were used which were uniformly distributed
over the range for which the current detection protocol detects the
entanglement. In order to experimentally detect entanglement in these
states, three Pauli operators need to be measured in each case.
Previously developed schemes [ 42 , 43 , 44 ] were utilized to measure
the required observables, which unitarily map the desired state followed
by NMR ensemble average measurements. In each case full quantum state
tomography (QST) [ 41 , 212 ] was also performed to verify the success
of the detection protocol as well as to establish that the
experimentally created states are indeed PPT entangled. This work is
important both in the context of preparing and characterizing bound
entangled states and in devising new experimental schemes to detect PPT
entangled states which use much fewer resources than are required by
full quantum state tomography schemes. It should be noted here that we
prepare the PPT entangled states using NMR in the sense that the total
density operator for the spin ensemble always remains close to the
maximally mixed state and at any given instance one is dealing with
pseudo-entangled states [ 235 ] .

### 5.2 Bound Entanglement in a Qubit-Ququart System

Consider a 3-qubit quantum system with an 8-dimensional Hilbert space
@xmath , where @xmath represent qubit Hilbert spaces. If we choose to
club the last two qubits into a single system with a four-dimensional
Hilbert space @xmath , the three-qubit system can be reinterpreted as a
qubit-ququart bipartite system with Hilbert space @xmath .

Formally one can say that the four ququart basis vectors @xmath are
mapped to the logical state vectors of the second and third qubits as
@xmath and @xmath in the computational basis. With this understanding,
we will freely use the three-qubit computational basis for this
qubit-ququart system, where all along it is understood that the last two
qubits form a ququart. For this system consider a family of PPT bound
entangled states parametrized by a real parameter @xmath introduced by
Horodecki [ 103 ] .

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

with

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.2)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

It has been shown in [ 103 ] that the states in the family @xmath
defined above are entangled for @xmath and is separable in the limiting
cases @xmath . One can explicitly write the density operator for the
mixed PPT entangled states defined in Equation ( 5.1 ) in the
computational basis as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

It is interesting to observe that for @xmath , this family of states
reduce to a separable state in 2 @xmath 4 dimensions while it is still
entangled in the three-qubit space and the entanglement is restricted to
the two qubits forming the ququart.

Having defined the family of PPT entangled states in Eq.( 5.3 )
parameterized by ‘ @xmath ’, the method that used to experimentally
detect their entanglement using a protocol proposed in Reference [ 234 ]
is described as follows. Although the family of states in Eq. ( 5.3 ) is
PPT entangled in @xmath -dimensional Hilbert space, it is useful to
exploit the underlying three-qubit structure. For the detection
protocol, we define three observables @xmath , with @xmath (here @xmath
acting on the qubit space and @xmath and @xmath act in the state space
of qubits 2 and 3 forming the ququart)

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath are the Pauli operators and @xmath is the 2 @xmath 2
identity operator. Although the observables @xmath defined above are
written in the three qubit notation, they are bonafide observables of
the qubit-ququart system. The main result of Reference [ 234 ] is that
any three-qubit separable state, @xmath , obeys the four inequalities
given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, if a states violates even one of the four inequalities given
in Eq. ( 5.5 ), it has to be entangled. It was shown numerically in [
234 ] that the inequalities defined in Equation ( 5.5 ) can be used to
detect the entanglement present in the states @xmath defined in Eq. (
5.3 ) for @xmath . Hence, the protocol briefed above is able to detect
the entanglement of this family of PPT entangled states in @xmath
dimensions.

### 5.3 Experimental Detection of 2@xmath4 Bound Entanglement

Next is to proceed toward procedure followed to experimentally prepare
several different states from the family of states given by Eq. ( 5.3 ),
detect them by measuring the observables defined in Eq. ( 5.4 ) and
check if we observe a violation of the inequalities defined in Eq. ( 5.5
). i

In order to prepare the PPT entangled family of states in @xmath
dimensions using three qubits, three spin-1/2 nuclei ( @xmath H, @xmath
F and @xmath C) were chosen to encode the three qubits in a @xmath
C-labeled sample of diethylfluoromalonate dissolved in acetone-D6. See
Sec- 4.2.1 for NMR parameters, PPS preparation and state mapping
details. Three dedicated channels for @xmath H, @xmath F and @xmath C
nuclei were employed having @xmath RF pulse durations of 9.33 @xmath s,
22.55 @xmath s and 15.90 @xmath s at the power levels of 18.14 W, 42.27
W and 179.47 W respectively.

The experimentally prepared bound entangled states in the current study
were directly detected using the protocol discussed in Sec. 5.2 and full
QST [ 41 ] was also performed in each case to verify the results.

The next step was to experimentally prepare the PPT entangled family of
states given in Eq. ( 5.3 ) (each with a fixed value of the parameter
@xmath ) and to achieve this we utilized the method of temporal
averaging [ 36 ] . The family of states @xmath is an incoherent mixture
of several pure states as given in Eq.( 5.2 ), and the quantum circuit
to prepare one such nontrivial state ( @xmath ) is given in Fig. 5.1
(a), where @xmath represents a local unitary rotation through an angle
@xmath with a phase @xmath . After experimentally preparing the state,
one can measure the desired observable in Eq. ( 5.4 ), by mapping the
state onto the Pauli basis operators.

The quantum circuit to achieve this is shown in Fig. 5.2 (a), and this
circuit maps the state @xmath such that @xmath . The motivation for such
a mapping [ 42 , 43 , 44 ] relies on the fact that in an NMR scenario,
the expectation value @xmath , can be readily measured [ 28 ] . The crux
of the temporal averaging technique relies on the fact that the five
states composing the PPT entangled state are generated via five
different experiments. The states of these experiments are then added
with appropriate probabilities to achieve the desired PPT entangled
state. All the five states, appearing in Eq.( 5.2 ), i.e. @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath and the separable PPS state @xmath were
experimentally prepared with state fidelities @xmath 0.96. It is
worthwhile to note here that @xmath is a generalized biseparable state
while @xmath and @xmath are LOCC equivalent biseparable states with
maximal entanglement between the first and third qubits and @xmath is a
state belonging to the GHZ class. For the experimental demonstration of
the

detection protocol discussed in Sec. 5.2 values of @xmath were chosen
and thereby prepared five different PPT entangled states. The quantum
circuit as well as the NMR pulse sequence to prepare @xmath is shown in
Fig.( 5.1 ). Other states in Eq.( 5.2 ) have similar circuits as well as
pulse sequences and are not shown here. The tomograph for one such
experimentally prepared PPT entangled state, with @xmath and fidelity
@xmath , is shown in Fig.( 5.4 ).

In order to measure the expectation values of the observables appearing
in Eq.( 5.4 ) our earlier work [ 42 , 43 ] was utilized. The idea is to
unitarily map the state @xmath to a state say @xmath , such that @xmath
where @xmath is one of the observables to be measured in the state
@xmath . This is achieved by measuring @xmath on @xmath .

As an example, one can find the expectation value @xmath using the
quantum circuit given in Fig. 5.2 (a) and the NMR pulse sequence given
in Fig. 5.2 (b) is implemented, followed by a measurement of the spin
magnetization of the third qubit. Such a normalized magnetization of a
qubit in the mapped state is indeed proportional to the expectation
value of the @xmath -spin angular momentum of the qubit [ 28 ] .

Experimentally measured values of the inequality given in Eq. ( 5.5 )
with maximum violation are reported in Table- 5.1 . For all five states
with different @xmath values, full QST was also performed and the
observables 5.4 were analytically computed from the reconstructed
density operators. All the experimental results, tabulated in Table- 5.1
, are plotted in Fig. ( 5.3 ). All the experiments were performed
several times to ensure the reproducibility of the experimental results
as well as to estimate the errors reported in Table 5.1 . It was
observed that the experimental values, within experimental error limits,
agree well with theoretically expected values and validate the success
of the detection protocol in identifying the PPT entangled family of
states. The direct QST based measurements of the state also validate our
experimental results.

### 5.4 Conclusions

The characterization of bound entangled states is useful since it sheds
light on the relation between intrinsically quantum phenomena such as
entanglement and nonlocality. The detection of bound entangled states is
theoretically a hard task and there are as yet no simple methods to
characterize all such states for arbitrary composite quantum systems.
The structure of PPT entangled states is rather complicated and does not
easily lead to a simple parametrization in terms of a noise parameter.
Work described in this chapter reports the experimental creation of a
family of PPT entangled states of a qubit-ququart system and the
implementation of a detection protocol involving local measurements to
detect their bound entanglement. Five different states which were
parametrized by a real parameter ‘ @xmath ’, were experimentally
prepared (with state fidelities @xmath 0.95) to represent the PPT
entangled family of states. All the experiments were repeated several
times to ensure the reproducibility of the experimental results and
error estimation. In each case it was observed that the detection
protocol successfully detected the PPT entanglement of the state in
question within experimental error limits. The results were further
substantiated via full QST for each prepared state. It would be
interesting to create the PPT entangled family of states using different
pseudopure creation techniques and in higher dimensions. The results of
this chapter are contained in Phys. Lett. A , (2019),

## Chapter 6 Experimental Implementation of Navascués-Pironio-Acín
Hierarchy to Detect Quantum Non-Locality

### 6.1 Introduction

This chapter reports the experimental investigations of the non-local
character of quantum correlations in a hierarchy-based protocol. It is
well established that quantum computation has a computational advantage
over its classical counterpart and the main resources utilized for
quantum computation are superposition, entanglement and other quantum
correlations [ 7 ] . Entanglement plays a key role in several quantum
computational tasks e.g. quantum cryptography protocols [ 236 ] ,
quantum teleportation [ 237 ] , quantum super dense coding [ 238 ] ,
measurement-based quantum computation [ 239 ] and quantum key
distribution schemes [ 240 , 241 ] . Creating entangled states in an
experiment and certifying the presence of entanglement in such states is
of utmost interest [ 58 , 50 ] and importance from the practical as well
as the foundational aspects of quantum physics. Most of the known
entanglement detection schemes rely on experimental quantum state
reconstruction [ 50 ] . It has been shown that quantum state
reconstruction is not cost-effective with respect to experimental and
computational resources [ 242 ] and further, the detection of
entanglement of a known state is computationally a hard problem [ 243 ]
and scales exponentially with the number of qubits. Methods to detect
entanglement have used violation of Bell-type inequalities [ 244 , 245 ]
, entanglement witnesses [ 79 , 142 ] , expectation values of the Pauli
operators [ 146 , 246 ] as well as dynamical learning techniques [ 247 ]
. Although a number of schemes exist for entanglement detection, but
most of them lack generality.

The motivation of the investigation is to experimentally implement a
non-local correlation and thereby devise an entanglement detection
protocol which can readily be generalized to higher numbers of qubits as
well as to multi-dimensional quantum systems. A promising direction is
to experimentally observe the violation of Bell-type inequalities [ 248
, 132 , 249 ] . This is particularly suitable as such inequalities have
recently been proposed as a general method for certifying the non-local
nature of the experimentally observed correlations in a
device-independent manner [ 250 , 251 , 252 ] . Work described in this
chapter details demonstration of the experimental implementation of the
Navascués-Pironio-Acín (NPA) hierarchy to certify the non-local
correlations arising from local measurements [ 250 , 251 , 252 ] on a
three-spin system.

Consider a joint probability distribution @xmath . The question
addressed in Ref. [ 250 ] is that can there be a quantum description of
@xmath i.e. can one have a quantum state @xmath , acting on the joint
Hilbert space @xmath , and the local measurement operators @xmath and
@xmath such that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here @xmath and @xmath are local projection operators. This question can
be used to design a test for the detection of non-locality from the
actual probability distribution @xmath . In order to answer the above
question, in general, one may need to search over all physical @xmath
and projection operators @xmath which makes the problem computationally
hard. A few attempts have been made to solve this problem and the first
one to find the maximum violation of Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH)
inequality [ 249 ] by a quantum description was Tsirelson [ 253 ] . Such
attempts were limited to the simplest scenarios and were nowhere near
generalization. Notable work has been done by Landau [ 254 ] and Wehner
[ 255 ] , where they have shown that the test of whether the
experimental correlations arise from quantum mechanical description of
nature or not, can be transformed to a semi-definite program (SDP).
Solving such an SDP can reveal the local or non-local nature of the
observed correlations.

### 6.2 Brief Review of NPA Hierarchy

In order to define SDP, consider projectors corresponding to outcomes
belonging to same measurement @xmath as E @xmath and E @xmath . The
projectors :

1.  are orthogonal i.e. @xmath for @xmath , @xmath M, @xmath

2.  sum to identity i.e. @xmath

3.  obey @xmath

4.  obey the commutation rule (for projectors on subsystems A and B) as:

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (6.2)
      -- -------- -- -------

It was assumed in Ref. [ 250 ] that such a @xmath exists that satisfies
Eq.( 6.1 ) and ( 6.2 ), and then they looked for the implications as
follows: It was observed that by taking products of projection operators
@xmath and linear superposition of such products, one may define new
operators which may neither be projectors anymore nor Hermitian. Let
@xmath be a set of @xmath such operators. There exists an @xmath matrix
associated with every such set @xmath and defined as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

@xmath is Hermitian and satisfies

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

Further, it can easily be proved that @xmath is positive semi-definite
i.e. @xmath [ 250 ] . So, if a joint probability distribution P @xmath
has a quantum description i.e. there exists a state @xmath and local
measurement operators satisfying Eq.( 6.1 ) and ( 6.2 ) respectively,
then finding such a state is equivalent to finding the matrix @xmath
satisfying linear constraints similar to Eq. ( 6.4 ) and Eq. ( 6.5 ) and
this amounts to solving an SDP problem.

Having introduced the NPA hierarchy, one can move on to the protocol
outlined in Ref. [ 252 ] that has been exploited in the current
experimental study. The joint probability distribution considered is
assumed to arise from local measurements on a separate state @xmath .
The state @xmath is shared among @xmath parties, each of them can
perform ‘ @xmath ’ measurements and each such measurement can have ‘
@xmath ’ outcomes. Measurement by i @xmath party is represented by
@xmath with @xmath being the measurement choice and @xmath being the
corresponding outcome. By observing the statistics generated by
measuring all possible @xmath , one may write the empirical values for
the joint probability distributions

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

The correlations observed by measuring @xmath locally, get encoded in
the conditional probability distributions having the form ( 6.6 ).
Similar expressions can be written for the reduced state probability
distribution which may arise from local measurements on a reduced
system.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with @xmath , @xmath and @xmath is the reduced density operator obtained
from @xmath by tracing out an appropriate subsystem. Since we are
dealing with dichotomic measurements on qubits, it will be useful to
introduce the concept of correlators and their expectation values as
follows

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

The index @xmath here dictates the order of the correlator while @xmath
with @xmath and @xmath . For @xmath the correlator will be of second
order of form @xmath while for @xmath one can have the full body
correlator. It will be seen later that these correlators in the simplest
case turn out to be multi-qubit Pauli operators entering the moment
matrix (Eq.( 6.8 )).

#### 6.2.1 Modified NPA Hierarchy

Having discussed the main features of NPA hierarchy [ 250 ] , the method
for the detection of non-local correlation is described as follows.
Consider a set @xmath with @xmath and @xmath are some product of the
measurement operators @xmath or their linear combinations. One can
associate a @xmath matrix with @xmath defined by Eq.( 6.3 ) as @xmath .
For a given choice of measurements on a separable state (a) @xmath will
be a positive semi-definite matrix, (b) Matrix elements of @xmath
satisfy the linear constraints similar to Eq.( 6.4 )-( 6.5 ), (c) Some
of the matrix element of @xmath can be obtained by experimentally
measuring the probability distribution and (d) Some of the @xmath matrix
entries corresponds to unobservables. Keeping these facts in mind, one
can design a hierarchy based test to see if a given set of correlations
can arise from an actual quantum realization by performing local
measurements on a separable state. One can define a set @xmath
consisting of products of ‘ @xmath ’ local measurement operators or
linear superpositions of such products. Once @xmath is defined, one can
look for associated @xmath satisfying constraints similar to Eq.( 6.4
)-( 6.5 ) to see if a given set of correlations can arise from actual
local measurements on a separable state. If no solution is obtained to
such an SDP then this would imply that the given set of correlations
cannot arise by local measurements on a separable quantum state and
hence the correlations are non-local. One can always find a stricter set
of constraints by increasing the value of @xmath i.e. testing the nature
of correlations at the next level of the hierarchy.

In the experimental demonstration, as suggested in Ref. [ 252 ] , the
set of commutating measurements have been used to design the SDP i.e. an
additional constraint is introduced on the entries of @xmath such that
local measurements also commutate. This additional constraint
considerably reduces the original computationally-hard problem [ 252 ] .
All the ideas developed till now can be understood with an example.
Consider @xmath , two dichotomic measurements per party at the hierarchy
level @xmath . Let the measurement be labeled as @xmath and @xmath with
@xmath . Set of operators is @xmath . One can see the corresponding
moment matrix @xmath can be written as

  -- -- -- -------
           (6.8)
  -- -- -- -------

while following are the unassigned variables
@xmath

One may note that by introducing local measurements commutativity i.e.
@xmath the matrix elements, of the @xmath matrix given by Eq.( 6.8 )
were simplified. Particularly, the following reduction in the number of
variables can be noticed : @xmath for @xmath and @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath and also @xmath . For a visual representation,
the variables that become identical because of the commutativity
constraints are represented by the same color in Eq.( 6.8 ). The hence
generated SDP will check if the set of observed correlations @xmath are
local. This can be achieved by substituting the experimental values of
the correlators in @xmath matrix and leaving the unobservables as
variables. SDP will optimize over such variables to see if a given set
of correlations are local or non-local. It has been shown [ 256 , 251 ]
that this method converges i.e. if a given set of correlations are
non-local then the SDP will fail at a finite number of steps @xmath .

### 6.3 Tripartite Non-Local Correlation Detection

To experimentally demonstrate the detection of correlations which can
not arise from local measurements on a separable state, a three-qubit
system was used. It has been shown [ 73 ] that a genuine three-qubit
system can be entangled in two inequivalent ways. CHSH scenario [ 249 ]
deals with (2, 2, 2) case i.e. @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . Any
correlation violating CHSH inequality exhibits non-local nature in a
sense that in principle one cannot write a local hidden variable theory
which can reproduce the observed statistics. In the current experimental
study, the scenario is (3,2,2) i.e. three parties with two dichotomic
observables per party. The measurements of three parties are labeled as
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath with @xmath . One can construct set @xmath
for three parties the way it was done in the previous section for @xmath
. As detailed in Ref. [ 252 ] to detect non-local correlations arising
from W state one needs to perform local measurements @xmath and @xmath
for all three parties for the observables entering the moment matrix
associated with @xmath defined above. Here @xmath are the spin-half
Pauli operators. Also for GHZ type state the measurements to generate
the statistics were chosen as @xmath and @xmath . A full body correlator
is also introduced while detecting non-local correlations generated by
GHZ state as such states are not suitable for detection of non-local
correlation using fewer body correlators [ 252 ] .

#### 6.3.1 NMR Implementation of Non-Local Correlations Detection Scheme

In order to experimentally demonstrate the detection of non-local
correlations, NMR hardware was used. Further, a three nuclear spin-
@xmath ensemble was utilized to initialize the quantum system in
prerequisite state on which local measurements were performed. As
already stated there are only two inequivalent classes [ 73 ] , under
local operations and classical communications (LOCC), of genuine
tripartite entanglement viz W-class and GHZ-class. So the system was
initialized in the representative states of both these classes, to be
tested experimentally. In order to test the non-locality present in
experimental expectation values of the correlators following steps were
followed for a given state:

-   Quantum system was initialized in one of the genuine tripartite pure
    states.

-   It was assumed that the correlations observed from local
    measurements on such states will fail SDP formulated in Sec.- 6.2 at
    the second level of the modified NPA hierarchy.

-   At the second level ( @xmath ) of the hierarchy, the expectation
    values of all the correlators were measured experimentally in the
    state under investigation.

-   Once all the observables of the moment matrix @xmath Eq. ( 6.3 )
    were measured experimentally, they were fed in the matrix @xmath ,
    then the rest of the unobservable entries were left as variables to
    be optimized via SDP to achieve @xmath under linear constraints
    similar to Eq.( 6.4 )-( 6.5 ) as well as commutativity relaxation
    constraints @xmath to NPA hierarchy.

-   Above formulated SDP was solved using codes available at [ 257 ] by
    modifying them for (3,2,2) scenario.

#### 6.3.2 NMR Experimental Set-up and System Initialization

For the experimental realization @xmath labeled diethylflouromalonate
sample dissolved in acetone-D6 in liquid state NMR is used. Three spin-
@xmath nuclei i.e. @xmath , @xmath and @xmath encode the qubit 1, qubit
2 and qubit 3 respectively. The free Hamiltonian of three qubit system
in the rotating frame is given by [ 28 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

with indices @xmath =1, 2 or 3 represent the qubit number, @xmath is the
respective chemical shift, @xmath being the @xmath -component of spin
angular momentum and @xmath is the scalar coupling constant. System was
initialized in the pseudopure state (PPS) @xmath using spatial averaging
technique [ 36 , 211 ]

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the room temperature thermal magnetization and @xmath is
8 @xmath 8 identity operator. Details of the experimental parameters,
state preparation and state mapping can be found in Sec.- 4.2.1 . State
mapping is used to measure the desired correlators which happens to be
Pauli operators in the current demonstration. Quantum circuits and NMR
pulse sequences to prepare the W and GHZ states are given in Ref. [ 157
] .

#### 6.3.3 Non-Locality Detection by Experimentally Measuring the
Moments/Correlators

At the second level of the modified NPA hierarchy in (3, 2, 2) scenario
the set @xmath @xmath .

The moment matrix in this case is a 22 @xmath 22 matrix with all
diagonal entries as 1. Further, the matrix has 26 observable moments
while rest of the moments enter the moment matrix as unobservables and
were left as variables to be optimized in SDP as detailed in Sec.- 6.3.1
. As an example, the moment/correlator @xmath , in the case of W state,
is an observable @xmath while the moment/correlator @xmath is @xmath
which is not an observable and hence entered the moment matrix as a SDP
variable. The next task was to find the expectation values of the
correlators in the state under investigation. In NMR experiments the
observed signal is proportional to the @xmath -magnetization of the
ensemble which indeed is proportional to the expectation value of the
Pauli @xmath -spin angular momentum operator in the given state. Hence
the direct observable in typical NMR experiments is the Pauli @xmath
-operator expectation values of the nuclear spins. In recent works [ 42
, 43 ] , schemes were developed to find the expectation values of any
desired Pauli operators in the given state. This was achieved by mapping
the state @xmath followed by @xmath -magnetization measurement. It has
been shown in [ 42 , 43 ] that the expectation value of @xmath in state
@xmath is indeed the expectation value of the desired Pauli operator in
the state @xmath . The explicit forms of the unitary operators @xmath ,
as well as quantum circuits and NMR pulse sequences, for two and three
qubit Pauli spin operators are given in Refs. [ 42 ] & [ 43 ]
respectively.

As stated earlier the information regarding local/non-local nature of
the observed correlations gets encoded in the measured correlators
@xmath . The hence formulated SDP in both the cases, i.e. W as well GHZ
state, failed to find @xmath at the second level of the modified NPA
hierarchy. This confirmed that the observed correlations can not arise
from the local measurements on a separable state and hence the states
are genuinely entangled. A bar plot for the observable moments of the
moment matrix @xmath for W-state and GHZ-states is depicted in Fig( 6.1
). In both the cases the SDP was also formulated directly from
experimentally reconstructed density matrices using full QST. This
further verified and supported the results of modified NPA protocol
obtained by the direct measurements of the correlators. It is
interesting to note here the experimental protocol demonstrated here was
on pure states but the scheme is also capable of detecting non-locality
of states which are convex sum of white noise and pure states up to a
certain degree of mixedness [ 252 ] .

### 6.4 Conclusions

Modified NPA hierarchy was used to detect the non-local nature of the
correlations performing local measurements by means of a semi-definite
program. A set comprising of products and/or linear superpositions of
such products was defined and an associated positive semi-definite
moment matrix was also defined. Non-local correlation detection
protocols require measuring some correlator experimentally, to generate
the statistics to be tested. Once the moment matrix embedded with the
empirical data is obtained, the semi-definite program optimizes, under
some linear constraints on the entries of the moment matrix, to see if
the observed correlations can arise from local measurements on a
separable state. The protocol has been tested experimentally on
three-qubit W and GHZ states utilizing NMR hardware. In both the cases,
the SDP successfully detected the non-local nature of the observed
correlation, as the resulting SDP was unfeasible at the second level of
the modified hierarchy. These results were also verified by direct full
quantum state tomography. It would be interesting to see the performance
of the protocol in higher dimension as well as more number of parties on
an actual physical system, as the structure of the entanglement classes
is much more complex in such cases.

The subsystems involved in our experiments reside on the same molecule
and therefore, strictly speaking it is not possible to achieve a
space-like separation between the events occurring in the different
subsystem spaces. Therefore, the term “local” here pertains to
subsystems and non-local implies something that goes across subsystems
i.e. involves operators that are go beyond subsystems and refer to joint
measurements. This word of caution is important and therefore we
explicitly mention it here.

## Chapter 7 Summary and Future Outlook

This thesis is a step further in the direction of experimental detection
of quantum correlations including entanglement and discord. Most of the
existing quantum correlation detection protocols require the state
information beforehand to yield the detection results. Also, most such
protocols are cost-intensive on experimental as well as computational
resources. The thesis begins with the experimental investigation of the
quantum entanglement in arbitrary bipartite states. In order to witness
the entanglement the concept of entanglement witness (EW) was utilized.
The key feature of the detection protocol is that it does not require
any prior state information. A set of local measurements was chosen in
such a way that, after measurement, they helped in the construction of
EW and thereby entanglement detection utilizing semi-definite
programming (SDP). It was demonstrated that only a three measurement
setting sufficed to detect the entanglement in the case of maximally
entangled Bell states. The protocol was also tested on a two-parameter
class of qubit-qutrit entangled states and simulations suggest that only
four measurement settings can successfully detect the entanglement. This
work is an extension of the simulations on qutrit-qutrit entanglement
detection [ 166 ] and is a promising candidate for higher-dimensional
bipartite entanglement detection utilizing EW through SDP. Its worth
mentioning that the a critical step is to strategically choose the set
of measurement settings and this in-turn ensure the optimal entanglement
detection.

The next experimental investigation was focused on the detection of
quantum correlations possessed by separable mixed states e.g.
non-classical correlations (NCC). A non-linear positive map was
successfully implemented to detect the NCC present in a two-qubit state.
The key feature of the experimental implementation was that the
detection was achieved in a single-shot NMR experiment due to the
non-destructive nature of NMR measurements. The detection capabilities
of the positive-map were also explored by letting the state evolve. It
was observed that at the transverse relaxation time, i.e. @xmath scale,
the map was unable to detect NCC which otherwise was detected by direct
quantum discord (QD) calculations. Nevertheless, this appeared to be
attributed to the fact that the positive map utilized very low state
information to yield ‘ yes / no ’ answer on the status of NCC while QD
requires full quantum state tomography (QST). Scheme looks promising for
the experimental exploration of mixed states quantum correlations in
higher-dimensional as well as multipartite quantum systems.

Entanglement detection as well as characterization in random three-qubit
states was also investigated experimentally. The detection protocol was
tested on seven representative states of six SLOCC-inequivalent classes
and twenty randomly generated states. The entanglement measure 3-tangle
was utilized to differentiate between genuine three-qubit entangled
states, i.e. GHZ and W class of states, in a single experiment. Only
four experimental settings proved to be sufficient for the successful
classification of the entanglement in the three-qubit pure generic
states. Further, concurrence based three-qubit entanglement
classification protocol for the most general three-qubit states was also
implemented successfully. It would be interesting to explore the
entanglement classification in more than three-qubit states, utilizing
Pauli witness operators, as the entanglement characterization is a
challenging and non-trivial task.

Mixed states possess a more subtle type of entanglement, called the
bound entanglement(BE), which is undistillable into EPR pairs via LOCC
operations. Quantum states possessing BE doesn’t violate PPT (positive
under partial transposition) criterion. The thesis also explored a
single-parameter class of qubit-ququart BE states with the aim of their
detection using minimum experimental settings. The qubit-ququart states
were mapped on to three-qubit states as in both the cases the underlying
Hilbert space dimension is eight. BE detection method used the
measurement of only three Pauli observables to see the violation of
standard quantum limit (SQL). BE was successfully detected in several
representative states from the single-parameter BE class of states and
QST was used to establish the PPT nature of the experimentally created
states. Key feature was that the BE was detected in the states lying
near the entangled/separable boundary by directly measuring the Pauli
observables while QST failed to detect BE.

There are entangled states whose measurement statistics can be simulated
by a local hidden variable model. Bell-type inequalities e.g.
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality in particular is suitable
for experimental entanglement detection by observing the violation of
SQL. CHSH inequality is limited to @xmath scenario i.e. two-parties,
two-measurement settings per party with two outcomes for each
measurement setting. Experimental investigation for a general case
@xmath was considered utilizing Navascués-Pironio-Acín (NPA) hierarchy.
Protocol was tested on genuine three-qubit entangled states i.e. GHZ and
W states. It was demonstrated that the non-local nature of the quantum
correlations was detected at the second level of NPA hierarchy. This
method is particularly useful as it can easily be implemented in
multipartite as well as higher dimensional cases.
