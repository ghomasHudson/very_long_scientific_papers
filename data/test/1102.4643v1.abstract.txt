Causal dynamical triangulations (CDT) constitute a background
independent, nonperturbative approach to quantum gravity, in which the
gravitational path integral is approximated by the weighted sum over
causally well-behaving simplicial manifolds i.e. causal triangulations.
This thesis is an analysis of the data from the Monte Carlo computer
simulations of CDT in @xmath dimensions. It is confirmed here that there
exist the semiclassical limit of CDT for so-called @xmath (or equivalent
@xmath ) simplices, being a discrete version of the mini-superspace
model. Next, the form of the corresponding discrete action is
investigated. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the effective,
semiclassical solution works also after the inclusion of remaining
@xmath and @xmath simplices, treated collectively. A specific form of
the resulting extended discrete action is examined and a transition from
the broader framework to the former narrower one is shown.
