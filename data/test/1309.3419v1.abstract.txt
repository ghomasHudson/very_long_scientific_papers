We study behavior in space and time of random walks in an i.i.d. random
environment on @xmath , @xmath . It is assumed that the measure
governing the environment is isotropic and concentrated on environments
that are small perturbations of the fixed environment corresponding to
simple random walk. We develop a revised and extended version of the
paper of Bolthausen and Zeitouni (2007) on exit laws from large balls,
which, as we hope, is easier to follow. Further, we study mean sojourn
times in balls.

This work is part of the authorâ€™s PhD thesis under the supervision of
Erwin Bolthausen. A generalization of the results on exit measures to
certain anisotropic random walks in random environment is available at
arXiv:1309.3169 [math.PR] .
Subject classifications: 60K37; 82C41.
Key words: random walk, random environment, exit measure, pertubative
regime, non-ballistic behavior, isotropic.
