This thesis focuses on the various aspects of String Phenomenology
described in this introduction. It is structured as follows.

In the first part we will give a review of string compactification and
of the resulting four dimensional effective theories.

In the chapter 2 , we will start discussing how CY compactifications
arise in String Theory from requiring four dimensional supersymmetry.
Then we will introduce the concept of moduli of the CY solutions. We
will see that they give rise to four dimensional neutral massless
scalars, whose vev’s the physical couplings depend on. They are
incompatible with experiments and must be fixed to some value, getting a
large mass. We will explain how this is realized by the introduction of
flux background.

In chapter 3 we will concentrate on the effective four dimensional
description of String/M-theory flux vacua, in the approximation in which
the backreaction of fluxes on the geometry is neglected. We will review
three ensemble of vacua and we will see how fluxes stabilize the moduli
of the compactification manifold. Firstly the will study the Type IIB
flux vacua. We will present both the ten dimensional and the four
dimensional description [ 22 ] , and we will finally focus on how
hierarchy scales arise in this context. Then we will briefly present the
four dimensional description of Type IIA flux vacua given in [ 41 ] .
Finally we will give a detailed review on the M-theory vacua. We will
firstly describe compactification of M-theory on smooth and singular
@xmath holonomy manifolds and finally we will introduce fluxes and
explain how they stabilize the geometric moduli.

In the second and larger part of the thesis we will describe the results
of our work.

In chapter 4 we will present a short review of the Statistical program
outlined above. We will see what are the main motivations for a
statistical study of the string Landscape and what are the basic
techniques. We will introduce the result obtained in the ensemble of
Type IIB flux vacua, since it is the first ensemble of string vacua
where the statistical technique were applied. Then we will present the
results obtained in our work [ 42 ] . Fist we will give a brief review
of the Freund-Rubin statistics, and then we will describe in more
details the results obtained studying the @xmath holonomy ensemble. We
will give the results of the statistical study for general @xmath
holonomy vacua, and then we will concentrate on a particular class of
models in which the computations can be done explicitly. We will so
verify that fluxes stabilize all the geometrical moduli both in
supersymmetric and in non-supersymmetric vacua. Finally we will give a
comparison between our results and what one obtains in the Type IIB
case.

In chapter 5 we will pass to the ten dimensional approach to string
vacua. We will illustrate what is the effect of fluxes on the geometry,
implied by the requirement of four dimensional supersymmetry. We will
introduce and use the formalism of @xmath -structures. Then we will
present the results of [ 43 ] . We will give the ten dimensional
description of the Type IIA CY flux vacua, studied in [ 41 ] with a four
dimensional approach. We will study the modification of the equations,
given by the introduction of an orientifold plane and we will stabilize
the moduli. We will see that in the so called ”smeared” approximation,
we are able to get the same results that [ 41 ] get in the CY with
fluxes approximation.

In chapter 6 we will study one important aspect of flux compactification
of Type IIB theory. In one class of solutions of Type IIB equations, the
backreaction of the fluxes on the geometry leads to a non-factorisable
ten dimensional metric. The four dimensional metric is multiplied by the
warp factor, a function of extradimensional coordinates. This is
reminiscent of what happens in five dimensional models inspired by the
seminal Randall-Sundrum paper [ 33 ] . We will give a brief review of
such models and then we will illustrate how they can be realized in Type
IIB String Theory. We will describe the setup we have constructed in
this context in [ 44 ] . In particular we will see how fermion
localization and Yukawa hierarchy can be realized through an instanton
background on a D7-brane. At the end we will compare our results with
those obtained in five dimensional models.

Finally in chapter 7 we will focus on the realization of GUT theories in
M-theory compactifications on @xmath manifolds. We will firstly give a
short review of four dimensional GUT theories, concentrating on their
more dramatic prediction: the decay of proton. Then we will study
realizations of GUT in theories with gauge fields propagating in
extradimensions, but fermions localized in the bulk. This is actually
what happens in M-theory compactifications on singular @xmath manifolds.
Then we will introduce the results of our work [ 40 ] . We will see how
the proton decay rate can be highly suppressed in some decay channels,
due to a mechanism characteristic of these M-theory like realizations.
