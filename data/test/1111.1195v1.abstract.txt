This thesis has been conducted in the context of one of the
utmost important searches at current hadron colliders, that is the
search for the Higgs boson, the remnant of the electroweak symmetry
breaking. We wish to study the phenomenology of the Higgs boson in both
the Standard Model (SM) framework and its minimal Supersymmetric
extension (MSSM). After a review of the Standard Model in a first part
and of the key reasons and ingredients for the supersymmetry in general
and the MSSM in particular in a third part, we will present the
calculation of the inclusive production cross sections of the Higgs
boson in the main channels at the two current hadron colliders that are
the Fermilab Tevatron collider and the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC),
starting by the SM case in the second part and presenting the MSSM
results, where we have five Higgs bosons and focusing on the two main
production channels that are the gluon gluon fusion and the bottom
quarks fusion, in the fourth part. The main output of this calculation
is the extensive study of the various theoretical uncertainties that
affect the predictions: the scale uncertainties which probe our
ignorance of the higherâ€“order terms in a fixed order perturbative
calculation, the parton distribution functions (PDF) uncertainties and
its related uncertainties from the value of the strong coupling
constant, and the uncertainties coming from the use of an effective
field theory to simplify the hard calculation. We then move on to the
study of the Higgs decay branching ratios which are also affected by
diverse uncertainties. We will present the combination of the production
cross sections and decay branching fractions in some specific cases
which will show interesting consequences on the total theoretical
uncertainties. We move on to present the results confronted to
experiments and show that the theoretical uncertainties have a
significant impact on the inferred limits either in the SM search for
the Higgs boson or on the MSSM parameter space, including some
assessments about SM backgrounds to the Higgs production and how they
are affected by theoretical uncertainties. One significant result will
also come out of the MSSM analysis and open a novel strategy search for
the Standard Higgs boson at the LHC. We finally present in the last part
some preliminary results of this study in the case of exclusive
production which is of utmost interest for the experimentalists.
