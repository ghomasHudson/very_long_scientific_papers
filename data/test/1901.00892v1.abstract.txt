In this thesis, we develop algorithms similar to the Gaussian
elimination algorithm in symplectic and split orthogonal similitude
groups. As an application to this algorithm, we compute the spinor norm
for split orthogonal groups. Also, we get similitude character for
symplectic and split orthogonal similitude groups, as a byproduct of our
algorithms.

Consider a perfect field @xmath with @xmath , which has a non-trivial
Galois automorphism of order @xmath . Further, suppose that the fixed
field @xmath has the property that there are only finitely many field
extensions of any finite degree. In this thesis, we prove that the
number of @xmath -classes in the unitary group defined over @xmath is
finite. Eventually, we count the number of @xmath -classes in the
unitary group over a finite field @xmath , and prove that this number is
same as that of the general linear group over @xmath when @xmath is
large enough.
