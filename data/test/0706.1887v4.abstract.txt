In this diploma thesis a configuration space method presented by C.
Dullemond and E. van Beveren for computing all propagators of a scalar
field (Wightman, Hadamard and Schwinger functions, retarded, advanced
and Feynman propagator) is reviewed for four-dimensional Minkowski and
Anti de Sitter spacetime AdS @xmath . This method is then applied for
AdS @xmath as well as de Sitter spacetime dS @xmath of arbitrary
dimension @xmath , obtaining results in agreement with the literature.
The advantages of the method are that it needs neither mode summation
nor analytic continuation from euclidean time, while delivering the
propagators above including @xmath -prescription, plus as a nice bonus
the conformal dimension of a corresponding CFT field.
General properties of the considered spacetimes (namely various
coordinate systems and their metrics, chordal distances, relations
between conformal dimensions @xmath and the mass @xmath of the scalar
field, geodesics and the invariance of time ordering) are also examined
and compiled from various sources, providing an overview of geometrical
properties of AdS and dS spacetimes.
Writing a thesis is compulsory in Germany in order to obtain the
academic degree of Diploma Physicist which is equivalent to a Master
degree. This diploma thesis was written in the QFT and String Theory
Group of Prof. Jan Plefka at the Institute of Physics of the Humboldt
University at Berlin under the kind supervision of Dr. Harald Dorn, to
whom I therefore wish to express my deepest gratitude.
A thesis naturally contains calculations down to a certain level of
detail. The inclined reader thus has the choice between following the
calculations or just looking up and enjoying the results.
