the results obtained in the course of the present work.

The appendix finally collects remarks on energy conditions satisfied by
the energy-momentum tensor, non-relativistic limit for the elastic
equations of motion and 3+1 decomposition for the Chistoffel symbols. It
also provides us with an easy 1+1 dimensional example to get used to the
basic definitions as introduced in chapter 3 .
