We compute the Minimal Entropy for every closed, orientable @xmath
-manifold, showing that its cube equals the sum of the cubes of the
minimal entropies of each hyperbolic component arising from the @xmath
decomposition of each prime summand. As a consequence we show that the
cube of the Minimal Entropy is additive with respect to both the prime
and the @xmath decomposition. This answers a conjecture asked by
Anderson and Paternain for irreducible manifolds in [ AP03 ] .
