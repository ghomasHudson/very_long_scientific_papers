Understanding the collective behavior of a quantum many-body system, a
system composed of a large number of interacting microscopic degrees of
freedom, is a key aspect in many areas of contemporary physics. However,
as a direct consequence of the difficultly of the so-called many-body
problem, many exotic quantum phenomena involving extended systems, such
as high temperature superconductivity, remain not well understood on a
theoretical level.

Entanglement renormalization is a recently proposed numerical method for
the simulation of many-body systems which draws together ideas from the
renormalization group and from the field of quantum information. By
taking due care of the quantum entanglement of a system, entanglement
renormalization has the potential to go beyond the limitations of
previous numerical methods and to provide new insight to quantum
collective phenomena. This thesis comprises a significant portion of the
research development of ER following its initial proposal. This includes
exploratory studies with ER in simple systems of free particles, the
development of the optimisation algorithms associated to ER, and the
early applications of ER in the study of quantum critical phenomena and
frustrated spin systems.

Keywords: Entanglement renormalization, quantum many-body systems,
