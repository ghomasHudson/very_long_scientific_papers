Techniques used to probe the IMF have different mass sensitivities.
Stellar kinematics in general should probe low and high mass end of the
mass function. However, because absorption lines required to derive
stellar kinematics are more prominent in ETGs, the short life-time of
high mass stars and massive star stellar remnants adds complexity to
distinguishing the excess of high/low mass stars (eg., Cappellari
et al., 2012 ; Smith, 2014 ) . Similarly, gravity sensitive absorption
features prominent in ETGs only allow the low mass end of the IMF (
@xmath M @xmath ) to be probed (eg., van Dokkum & Conroy, 2012 ;
Martín-Navarro, 2016 ) . Furthermore, combining gravitational lensing
models with stellar absorption features can be used to probe the lower
end of the mass function, however, added complexity arises due to the
assumptions of the dark mater halo models required in the modelling
process (eg., Treu et al., 2010 ) .

Emission line features of galaxies are more sensitive to the high mass
stars, and are widely used to constrain the high mass end of the IMF.
The lack of newly formed stars in ETGs makes it impossible to use such
features to probe the high mass IMF of ETGs. Emission lines such as [Ne
iii ] are sensitive to higher masses and have been used to show excesses
of high mass stars ( @xmath M @xmath ), however, discrepancies between
stellar libraries in producing such features adds further complexity to
the probe of the IMF (eg., Rigby & Rieke, 2004 ) . Optical colours of
galaxies along with star-formation indicators also probe the mass
function @xmath M @xmath (eg., Schombert et al., 1990 ; Lee et al., 2004
; Nanayakkara et al., 2017 ) . H @xmath EWs vs rest-frame optical
colours are effectively sensitive to stellar masses @xmath M @xmath ,
however, our limited understanding of stellar evolution at the high mass
end ( @xmath M @xmath ), along with the presence of exotic stellar
features such as extreme low-metallicity stars, high stellar rotation,
and binaries adds further complexity (see Chapter 5 ). Furthermore, H
@xmath flux along with FUV fluxes of galaxies can effectively probe the
IMF at higher masses ( @xmath M @xmath ), however, effects of dust,
metallicity, and stochasticity of SFH leads to extra caveats (eg.,
Meurer, 2011 ) .
