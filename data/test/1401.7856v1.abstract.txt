Quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the quantum field theory of strong
interactions, is highly nonpertubative in the low-energy sector, where
confinement dominates and resonance phenomena are observed. Therefore,
phenomenological unquenched models based on the old ideas of the @xmath
-matrix theory give a fundamental contribution to understand the complex
pattern of masses, widths and shapes of experimentally observed meson
resonances.
In the present thesis we employ the Resonance-Spectrum-Expansion
coupled-channel model to study two enigmatic meson states, the isoscalar
vector @xmath and the charmonium-like axial-vector @xmath . The same
model is applied to describe the peculiar pattern of masses and widths
of the open-charm axial-vectors – pseudovectors @xmath and @xmath , and
@xmath and @xmath . Furthermore, a simplified Schrödinger model is used
to study the dominant wave-function components of @xmath near its
resonance mass.
Both models successfully describe the whole variety of special features
observed in experiment, which are not so easily explained in
QCD-inspired quenched models.

Keywords: meson spectroscopy, unquenched, unitarity, coupled-channels,
confinement, @xmath -matrix poles, Schrödinger models, dynamical
resonances, hidden and open charm, axial-vectors.
