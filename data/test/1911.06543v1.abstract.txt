The ability to persist in the spacial environment is, not only in the
robotic context, an essential feature. Positional knowledge is one of
the most important aspects of space and a number of methods to represent
these information have been developed in the in the research area of
spatial cognition. The basic qualitative spatial representation and
reasoning techniques are presented in this thesis and several calculi
are briefly reviewed. Features and applications of qualitative calculi
are summarized. A new calculus for representing and reasoning about
qualitative spatial orientation and distances is being designed. It
supports an arbitrary level of granularity over ternary relations of
points. Ways of improving the complexity of the composition are shown
and an implementation of the calculus demonstrates its capabilities.
Existing qualitative spatial calculi of positional information are
compared to the new approach and possibilities for future research are
outlined.
