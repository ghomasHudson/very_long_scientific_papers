spatial knowledge  and reasoning about qualitative spatial knowledge  is
more "human-like" or "cognitively adequate" than classical approaches.

Artificial Intelligence and in particular spatial reasoning have many
applications, but an increasingly important one is robotics. Non-static
robots most often solve spatial problems like maintaining information
about their position, path-finding, way-planning, map-building or
goal-finding. Communicating with humans about spatial knowledge is
another important aspect of robotics. Topological information are often
useful, but for robotics the most important spatial information  is the
positional information. Qualitative approaches are very suited for
dealing with spatial knowledge  in robotics because they can handle
imprecise sensor data and omit unnecessary details.

The goal of this thesis is to develop a new qualitative calculus for
spatial reasoning about positions. Most often it is sufficient to reason
about points and to abstract from the extend of the objects. Many
existing qualitative spatial representations are too coarse for some
applications, especially for robotics. Thus a calculus for more
"Fine-grained Qualitative Spatial Reasoning about Point Positions" is
being presented in this thesis. This thesis is written with regard to
robotics but the calculus can be used for other applications that need
to reason about positional information as well.
