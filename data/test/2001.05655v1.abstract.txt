The blockchain concept forms the backbone of a new wave technology that
promises to be deployed extensively in a wide variety of industrial and
societal applications. Governments, financial institutions, banks,
industrial supply chains, service companies, and even educational
institutions and hospitals are investing in a substantial manner in the
hope of improving business efficiency and operational robustness through
deployment of blockchain technology. This thesis work is concerned with
designing trustworthy business-to-business (B2B) market platforms
drawing upon blockchain technology and game theory.

The proposed platform is built upon three key ideas. First, we use
permissioned blockchains with smart contracts as a technically sound
approach for building the B2B platform. The blockchain deploys smart
contracts that govern the interactions of enterprise buyers and sellers.
Second, the smart contracts are designed using a rigorous analysis of a
repeated game model of the strategic interactions between buyers and
sellers. We show that such smart contracts induce honest behavior from
buyers and sellers. Third, we embed cryptographic regulation protocols
into the permissioned blockchain to ensure that business sensitive
information is not revealed to the competitors. We believe our work is
an important step in the direction of building a powerful B2B platform
that maximizes social welfare and enables trusted collaboration between
strategic enterprise agents.
