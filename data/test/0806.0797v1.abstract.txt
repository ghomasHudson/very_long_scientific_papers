The only mass variable with its most significant bump exceeding the
discovery threshold is the mass of all four jets in the final states
with four jets of @xmath GeV, shown in Fig. 4.14 . This is attributed to
the “3-jet” effect, the main cause of all shape discrepancies in this
analysis. Fig. 4.15 shows another instance of the same effect in that
final state. The same effect is observed in final states of different
jet multiplicity, as shown in Fig. 4.16 .

Although no discovery-level bumps were found in other mass variables, it
is interesting to present the most interesting bumps found in some mass
distributions.

In the mass of the @xmath pair in the final state with two opposite sign
electrons ( @xmath ) the most significant bump corresponds to a 2.7
@xmath effect, which is though exactly at the @xmath boson resonance.
The number of expected events there is so high, that even the slightest
systematic mismodeling would appear as very statistically significant.
From Fig. 4.17 it is clear that this “bump” is not due to new physics,
but a tiny systematic mismodelling of the @xmath -peak, with no visible
effect anywhere else.

The mass of the two muons in the @xmath final state does not have any
significant bump either, not even of the mundane kind found in @xmath .
That is shown in Fig. 4.18 .

Another potentially interesting mass variable is the dijet mass in the
final state with two high @xmath jets. That is shown in Fig. 4.19 .
Unfortunately, no high-mass di-jet resonance was observed.
