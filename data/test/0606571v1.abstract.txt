This thesis investigates cusp cross-sections of arithmetic real,
complex, and quaternionic hyperbolic @xmath â€“orbifolds. We give a smooth
classification of these submanifolds and analyze their induced geometry.
One of the primary tools is a new subgroup separability result for
general arithmetic lattices.
