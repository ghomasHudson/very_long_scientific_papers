The notion of communication complexity was introduced by Yao in his
seminal paper [ Yao79 ] . In [ BFS86 ] , Babai Frankl and Simon
developed a rich structure of communication complexity classes to
understand the relationships between various models of communication
complexity. This made it apparent that communication complexity was a
self-contained mini-world within complexity theory. In this thesis, we
study the place of regular languages within this mini-world. In
particular, we are interested in the non-deterministic communication
complexity of regular languages.

We show that a regular language has either @xmath or @xmath non-determi-
nistic complexity. We obtain several linear lower bound results which
cover a wide range of regular languages having linear non-deterministic
complexity. These lower bound results also imply a result in semigroup
theory: we obtain sufficient conditions for not being in the positive
variety @xmath .

To obtain our results, we use algebraic techniques. In the study of
regular languages, the algebraic point of view pioneered by Eilenberg (
[ Eil74 ] ) has led to many interesting results. Viewing a semigroup as
a computational device that recognizes languages has proven to be
prolific from both semigroup theory and formal languages perspectives.
In this thesis, we provide further instances of such mutualism.
