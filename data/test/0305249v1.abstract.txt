In this thesis a connection between the world of discrete and continuous
conformal geometry is explored. The world of discrete conformal geometry
is related to disk pattern construction and triangulation production. In
particular we discover a generalization of the Thurston-Andreev theorem
to any angles in @xmath (when @xmath ).. The proof of this theorem
relies on an energy measuring how “uniform” the angle data of a
triangulation is, where by uniform angle data I mean the data of a
geodesic triangulation of a hyperbolic surface. The connection to
continuous geometry is via averaging this energy over geodesic
triangulations, a process which forms an energy measuring how “uniform”
(constant curvature) a metric is. In fact, the entire discrete energy
proof carries over to produce a proof of the metric uniformization
theorem of conformal geometry. The random triangulations used to produce
this averaging are random Delaunay triangulations, and they are explored
in some detail. In particular the averaging techniques developed to
construct the energy on metrics can be used to explore other geometric
issues, including the production of a probabilistic interpretation of
the determinant of the Laplacian and a new probabilistic proof of the
Gauss-Bonnet theorem.
