This thesis tackles the problem of learning efficient representations of
complex, structured data with a natural application to web page and
element classification. We hypothesise that the context around the
element inside the web page is of high value to the problem and is
currently under exploited. This thesis aims to solve the problem of
classifying web elements as subtrees of a DOM tree by also considering
their context.

To achieve this, first we discuss current expert knowledge systems that
work on structures, such as Tree-LSTM. Then, we propose context-aware
extensions to this model. We show that the new model achieves an average
F1-score of 0.7973 on a multi-class web classification task. This model
generates better representations for various subtrees and may be used
for applications such element classification, state estimators in
reinforcement learning over the Web and more.
