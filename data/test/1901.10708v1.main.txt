# Résumé

Les premières générations d’étoiles massives en rotation

et l’origine des étoiles CEMP

### Contexte

Les premières générations d’étoiles massives ¹ ¹ 1 Au moins 8 @xmath ,
i.e. 8 fois la masse du Soleil. sont des acteurs essentiels dans
l’histoire de l’Univers. À la fin de leur évolution, ces étoiles à
courte durée de vie ont explosé en supernovae @xmath un évènement dont
la luminosité peut atteindre 10 milliards de fois celle du Soleil @xmath
et ont, pour la première fois, enrichi l’Univers en métaux ² ² 2
Éléments plus lourds que l’hélium (par exemple l’oxygène). , dont
nous-mêmes et notre Terre sommes constitués. La compréhension, encore
méconnue aujourd’hui, de l’évolution de ces étoiles, est primordiale
afin d’acquérir une connaissance globale de l’évolution de l’Univers, en
particulier de son évolution chimique.

Bien qu’autour de nous, ces étoiles ne peuvent plus être observées, leur
nature peut être étudiée indirectement grâce à l’observation, dans notre
Galaxie, d’étoiles de faible masse et très pauvres en métaux. Certaines
de ces étoiles @xmath Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor ou CEMP @xmath se sont
probablement formées très tôt dans l’Univers, avec la matière éjectée
d’une ou de quelques-unes des premières étoiles massives, appelées
ci-après étoiles sources . La composition chimique particulière des
étoiles CEMP, déterminée par spectroscopie, donne de précieuses
informations sur la nucléosynthèse, et donc sur la nature de leur(s)
étoile(s) source(s). Les étoiles CEMP pourraient être comparées à des
“Pierre de Rosette”: leur déchiffrement permet d’étudier une
civilisation ancienne, aujourd’hui disparue.

### Objectifs et méthodes

Le but principal de ce travail de thèse est d’obtenir de nouveaux
indices sur la physique des premières générations d’étoiles massives en
utilisant les contraintes liées à l’observation des étoiles CEMP. Une
telle étude est possible en combinant des modèles numériques d’étoiles
sources avec les observations d’étoiles CEMP disponibles dans la
littérature. Le code d’évolution stellaire de Genève, principal outil
utilisé durant cette thèse, permet de modéliser l’évolution des étoiles
sources. Une des spécificités de ce code est d’inclure une modélisation
sophistiquée de la rotation différentielle. En outre, ce code permet le
calcul de la nucléosynthèse complète, y compris le processus s (capture
lente de neutron par des noyaux atomiques, permettant la production
d’éléments lourds). Ce processus, intervenant dans les étoiles de masse
intermédiaire @xmath entre 1 et 8 @xmath @xmath et massives, est supposé
être à l’origine d’environ 50 % des éléments plus lourds que le fer,
tels que le strontium, baryum, tungstène ou plomb par exemple.

### Résultats

Le mélange induit par la rotation dans l’étoile source déclenche des
échanges successifs de matière entre la zone de combustion d’hélium et
celle d’hydrogène. Il en résulte une nucléosynthèse riche et variée,
permettant la création, en grande quantité, de carbone, azote, oxygène,
fluor, néon, sodium, magnésium et aluminium. La composition chimique de
cette matière, enrichie en éléments divers, et finalement éjectée par
les vents stellaires et/ou lors de la supernova des modèles d’étoiles
sources, est en accord global avec la composition chimique des étoiles
CEMP les plus pauvres en fer.

Une comparaison plus détaillée entre ces étoiles CEMP et les modèles
d’étoiles sources a mis en évidence certains écarts entre les modèles et
les observations. Un mélange additionnel, survenant dans une zone
spécifique de l’étoile source, quelques centaines d’années avant son
explosion, permet de pallier ces désaccords. Une procédure automatique,
déterminant, parmi environ 35000 possibilités, le meilleur modèle
d’étoile source pour une étoile CEMP donnée, a été appliquée à un
échantillon de 69 étoiles CEMP. Les résultats suggèrent que les étoiles
sources sont préférentiellement des étoiles en rotation rapide,
d’environ 20 @xmath , qui ont subi le mélange additionnel et qui n’ont
éjecté que leurs couches externes.

Le mélange rotationnel affecte également la synthèse d’éléments s dans
l’étoile source, et ce, d’autant plus que la vitesse de rotation
initiale est élevée. La modélisation d’une nouvelle grille d’étoiles
massives @xmath @xmath @xmath @xmath , incluant rotation et processus s
montre que l’effet de la rotation sur le processus s intervient de
manière significative uniquement si la masse initiale de l’étoile est
inférieure à 60 @xmath . Au-delà de ce seuil, l’interaction entre le
mélange rotationnel et la nucléosynthèse est moindre. Par conséquent,
les modèles d’étoiles sources en rotation donnent des résultats
similaires aux modèles sans rotation. La signature chimique induite par
la rotation sur la production d’éléments s dans des étoiles sources de
@xmath @xmath a été identifiée dans plusieurs étoiles CEMP enrichies en
éléments s .

### Conclusion

L’étude de l’origine des étoiles CEMP à la lumière de nouveaux modèles
d’étoiles sources vient corroborer l’idée selon laquelle la rotation a
joué un rôle prépondérant dans l’Univers jeune. Par ailleurs, ce travail
suggère que (1) les premières générations d’étoiles massives pourraient,
pour la plupart, avoir une masse d’environ 20 @xmath (2) de puissantes
interactions entre différentes coquilles de combustion étaient à l’œuvre
dans ces étoiles et (3) ces étoiles ont probablement éjecté uniquement
leur enveloppe, tandis que les régions plus internes sont tombées sur
l’objet compact central.

Pendant cette thèse, si j’ai pu garder (je crois) les pieds sur Terre,
c’est déjà en partie grâce aux volleyeurs de Prévessin, avec qui
j’allais me défouler, boire des canettes et manger des ’zia’ chez da
Ettore. C’est surement aussi grâce à la sophrologie (quelle belle
découverte…) chez Philippe et Dominique. C’est certainement aussi grâce
à mes très chers amis Gessiens, Chenevessiens et Divonnais. Je vous
salue chaleureusement Louis, Florian, Tim, Olja, William, Nico, Remy,

bière-pizza (Charly’s), Salève, parcours de santé (10 tours), lactaire
délicieux (1), bobsleigh, Krazy House… Une franche accolade à Louis,
présent (mais disparaissant parfois après quelques pintes) aussi bien
dans les moments un peu difficiles que moins difficiles. Si j’ai gardé
la raison, c’est aussi grâce à Fanny, qui a compté, et à tous les
chouettes moments passés avec la bande, à Grenoble, Gex, Paris ou au fin
fond de l’Ardèche. C’est sans nul doute aussi grâce à mes tous proches
et leur bienveillance, mes parents et grand-parents, ma sœurette,
Nathalie, Uli, Julia. Je remercie au passage les relecteurs pour vos
corrections et suggestions en général fort pertinentes (mention spéciale
à Laurent et Jacqueline). Avec certitude, si je n’ai pas débloqué, c’est
aussi grâce à ma chère petite Perru***, arrivée sur le tard mais bien
arrivée. Que dire? Comment dire? Merci pour ta pétillance, bonne humeur
permanente, légèreté, humour, joie de vivre si communicative, pour avoir
eu des paroles réconfortantes quand mon moral dégringolait. Merci
surtout de m’avoir initié aux plantes vertes, à Dalida, aux Colocs, à la
brasse coulée et j’en passe. En passant, justement, merci au reste de la
famille Lap’ pour votre accueil simple et chaleureux. Pour terminer, si
je n’ai pas trop ondulé de la toiture pendant ces années, c’est peut
être aussi grâce à mes amis de longue et très longue date. Je pense à
Nathan, notre récent chavirement et notre future régate, à Rémi, au
frelon disparu et aux micro trous noirs, à Bidou et au thème entêtant de
Taxi Driver, à Dri, mutique ou chantant John Legend, à Verrier ainsi
qu’à son lit à mémoire de forme, à Dupin, aux ménisques bien faits et
aux GBF bien réglés, à Robin et Jeff Thirion, à Jouty et à nos frasques
à la Machine du Moulin Rouge, à Fercot et au Rachais, à Antoine
motocross et au robot de table, à Félix et au fameux jeu, à Manu et à
l’inondation du 3ème étage, à Gorjup enfin, avec sa clochette et son
poil soyeux.

## Chapter 1 Introduction

Stars are cosmic engines catching interstellar material, processing it
and giving it back during their lives or when they die. Almost all the
content in metal ¹ ¹ 1 Metals are elements heavier than helium. in the
Universe was synthesized in stars. Especially, the first metals in the
Universe were synthesized by the first stars, that were predominantly
massive ² ² 2 Stars are considered as massive when they go through all
hydrostatic burning stages, ultimately leading to an iron-core. The
lower mass limit is around 10 @xmath . and that are long-dead now. The
comprehension of the entire chemical evolution of the Universe requires
to understand its chemical evolution at all the different epochs, from
the first stars era to the present day Universe. The onset of the
chemical evolution, triggered by the early generation of massive stars,
is a crucial and still largely missing piece of the puzzle.

During the first minutes following the Big Bang, as the temperature
decreased from @xmath K to about @xmath K, the first nucleosynthetic
event in the Universe took place. The Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN)
finished about 15 minutes after the Big Bang, when the density and
temperature became too low for further nucleosynthesis to occur. At this
time, for 100 g of Universe, about 24.8 g was in the form of @xmath He
and almost all the rest in the form of protons ( cyburt03 ) . As shown
in the left panel of Fig. 1.1 , a bit of @xmath H, @xmath H, @xmath He
and other light elements is also found. Metals up to oxygen could also
be synthesized but in negligible amounts (generally below @xmath in mass
fraction, see Fig. 1.1 , right panel, also iocco07 ; coc12 ; coc14 ) .

380000 years after the BBN, the Universe became cool enough (about 3100
K), allowing protons and electrons to recombine and form neutral
hydrogen atoms. From this point, the Universe entered the dark ages. It
is transparent but no light-producing structures such as stars exist
yet.

#### 1.1.2 The formation of the first stars

The first stars (Population III or Pop III stars) formed @xmath Myr
later, with almost exactly 25 % of Helium and 75 % of Hydrogen in mass.
For a star to form, a gas cloud has to cool until its Jeans mass ³ ³ 3
The Jeans mass is the minimum mass of a gas cloud required in order the
gravitational force to overcome the gas pressure. When @xmath is
reached, the cloud becomes unstable and collapses. @xmath reaches the
mass scale of individual stars. In metal-rich environments, the cooling
of the molecular cloud is mainly controlled by heavy elements such as
carbon or oxygen. On the other side, it was found by saslaw67 that the
cooling in a low-temperature and metal-free environment is achieved by
molecular hydrogen H @xmath . The cooling efficiency of H @xmath being
low, the primordial gas is able to cool down to about @xmath K only (
abel02 ; bromm02 ) , against @xmath K at solar metallicity ⁴ ⁴ 4 The
metallicity is the sum of the mass fraction of elements heavier than
helium. The solar metallicity is @xmath ( asplund09 ) . . The higher
temperature in primordial gas clouds implies a higher @xmath and makes
the collapse and fragmentation of these clouds more difficult. The
fragments are consequently larger, suggesting that the first stars were
more massive.

Various multidimensional cosmological simulations have shown that the
first stars were predominantly massive (generally @xmath @xmath , e.g.
abel02 ; bromm02 ) . Some authors have refined this picture by
suggesting the existence of two distinct star formation modes for
Pop III, leading to two classes of Pop III stars: Pop III.1 and
Pop III.2 (e.g. johnson06 ) . Pop III.1 stars formed from metal-free
@xmath @xmath dark matter minihalos. Pop III.2 stars formed from a
metal-free gas cloud but which was significantly ionized by photons from
already existing Pop III.1 stars. Such an ionization favors the creation
of HD molecules in the star forming cloud, which increases the cooling
efficiency and leads to lower initial stellar masses. The mass
distribution of Pop III.2 stars, possibly peaking at @xmath @xmath (
hirano14 ) , is shifted towards lower values compared to Pop III.1
stars. However, if important turbulent motions were present in
primordial gas clouds, the picture is reversed: Pop III.2 stars are on
average more massive than Pop III.1 stars ( clark11 ) . Indeed, clark11
have shown that turbulence may be more vigorous in Pop III.1 clouds than
in Pop III.2 clouds, hence facilitating the fragmentation of Pop III.1
clouds, and ultimately leading to less massive stars on average. The
Pop III initial mass range predicted by the most recent simulations
still varies a lot from a study to another (cf. Fig. 1.2 ). For
instance, stacy16 predicts masses between 0.05 and 20 @xmath while
hosokawa16 between 15 and 600 @xmath . This could be due to differences
in the adopted resolution, number of minihaloes followed during the
simulation, time of the simulation or types of feedback implemented in
the simulation (see Table 1 of stacy16 , for an overview of the
characteristics of some simulations of first star formation) .

### 1.2 Origin of the elements

If gravity were the only force in stars, they would collapse in less
than one hour (the free-fall timescale is about 30 minutes for the Sun).
Stars have to produce energy to counteracts their own gravity. The
Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale @xmath gives an estimate of how long a star
would shine with its current luminosity if the only power source were
the conversion of gravitational potential to heat. For the Sun, @xmath
Myr. A lifetime of 30 Myr for the Sun is however too short in regards to
geological and biological evidences that the Earth is billions of years
old. Nuclear fusion provides another source of energy that sustains
stars for a much longer time. Stars gain energy by fusion only up to
iron because it is the most bound nucleus. Beyond iron, no fusion can
occur. Massive stars with initial masses @xmath undergo successive
shorter and shorter core burning stages, lasting from millions of years
to fractions of days, and ultimately leading to the onion-like structure
shown in Fig. 1.3 . At the end of each core burning phase, the burning
continues in a shell. As evolution proceeds, more and more burning
regions are present in the massive star (Fig. 1.3 ). Nucleosynthesis in
massive stars is discussed in more details in Sect. 3.1 .

As mentioned, stellar fusion can synthesize elements up to iron. The
main processes building elements beyond iron are neutron capture
processes ( burbidge57 ) . Neutrons are captured by nuclei that can
experience a @xmath decay reaction (a neutron is transformed into a
proton) if they are unstable. Neutron capture processes are generally
separated into two categories: slow and rapid (s- and r-processes), that
are both expected to contribute to synthesize about 50 % of the nuclei
beyond iron. For the r-process, neutron captures operate on much smaller
timescales than for the s-process, giving the possibility to reach very
neutron rich (unstable) isotopes that finally decay to the valley of
stability (i.e. to stable isotopes, see Fig. 1.4 ). For the s-process,
the neutron capture timescales @xmath are larger than the @xmath decay
timescales @xmath of unstable isotopes. It means that unstable isotopes
@xmath decay before another neutron is captured (with the exception of
the branching points where @xmath ). Starting from Fe, the s-process
runs mainly along the s-process path which stays close to the valley of
stability (black path in Fig. 1.4 ). The small neutron cross sections of
the magic nuclei around A=88, 140, and 208 are bottlenecks for the flow
and create distinct peaks in the typical s-process abundance pattern.
These peaks can be seen in the abundance pattern of the Sun (top left
panel of Fig. 1.4 ). The s-process ends at @xmath Pb, the last stable
nucleus.

Some isotopes are called s-only (marked as s in Fig. 1.4 ) because they
cannot be synthesized with the r-process. An example is @xmath Kr. The
very neutron-rich isotopes that @xmath decays to the valley of stability
(following a diagonal in the (N, Z) plane) after r-process
nucleosynthesis cannot reach @xmath Kr. This isotope is shielded by the
stable isotope @xmath Se. clayton61 have shown that abundances of s-only
isotopes in the Sun cannot be reproduced by a single neutron irradiation
of an iron seed. In fact, the abundances of elements between @xmath A
@xmath can be reproduced by a main s-process component while for the
elements below @xmath , a weak s-process component is required (
kappeler89 ) . The main component is associated to Thermally Pulsing
(TP) Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars with @xmath @xmath . The weak
component is associated to massive stars with @xmath 8 @xmath . These
two s-process components are discussed in Sect. 3.1 and 3.2 .

### 1.3 Stellar rotation

During the star formation process, the initial molecular cloud shrinks
by @xmath orders of magnitudes. The local conservation of angular
momentum ( @xmath constant) tells us that even if the initial gas cloud
rotates very slowly, the newly formed star will rotate fast. A simple
conservation of the angular momentum during star formation will however
produce only very fast rotator. Since all stars are not very fast
rotators, some processes able to dissipate angular momentum during the
star formation process have to be invoked.

There are many observational evidences that stars rotate. huang06 have
reported the equatorial velocity distribution of 496 OB stars, whose
velocity distribution peaks at 200 km s @xmath (Fig. 1.5 ). Because of
the centrifugal force exerted by rotation, fast rotating stars have an
ellipsoid-like shape with a bigger equatorial than polar radius. Thanks
to interferometric observations, domiciano03 have reconstructed the
shape of the fast rotating massive star Achernar (about 10 @xmath ).
They reported an equatorial radius 1.56 @xmath larger than the polar
radius.

Rotation is expected to affect the stellar luminosity, stellar
lifetimes, mass loss or the chemical composition of the stellar surface
for instance (e.g. meynet00b ; heger00b ) . Especially, massive stellar
models predict surface nitrogen enhancements because of the combined
effect of the CNO cycle operating in the stellar interior and rotational
mixing. martins15 reported the CNO surface abundances of 74 observed
O-type stars with masses between about 20 and 50 @xmath . 80 % of their
sample can be explained by single stellar models including rotation.

##### Rotation at low and zero metallicity

Low metallicity stars have less metals so that they are less opaques and
more compact. As a consequence, for the same angular momentum content,
low-metallicity stars rotate faster than solar metallicity stars. Low
metallicity stars generally lose little mass through winds meaning that
they keep more angular momentum than their solar counterpart. This also
favors a faster rotation. Faster rotation at low metallicity is
supported by different observations: hunter08b have shown that stars in
the Small Magellanic Cloud rotate on average faster than Galactic stars
(the latter having higher metallicities in general). maeder99 and
martayan07 have shown that the fraction of Be-type stars, whose
existence is possibly linked to fast rotation, increases with decreasing
metallicity.

For Pop III stars, stacy11 estimated their rotation speed thanks to
smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations. They have recorded the
angular momentum of the sink particles falling into the growing
protostar. The large amount of angular momentum suggests initial
velocities of @xmath km s @xmath or higher for stars with @xmath @xmath
. A caveat in this study is that they estimated the total angular
momentum accreted within a radius of 50 UA from the center of the star,
meaning that they do not resolve stellar scales. This prevents to see
whether some angular momentum removal processes (e.g. stellar winds,
disk-locking or magnetic torques) occur in the inner region.

Recently, by studying the angular momentum transfer in primordial discs
including magnetic fields, hirano18 suggested that the final rotational
state of Pop III protostars should exhibit a net bimodality: either the
protostar do not rotate at all, or it is a fast rotator, close to
breakup speed. As mentioned in their paper, this study does not properly
include MHD effects, which are likely required to self-consistently
assess this possible bimodality.

Rotation and its effect in low metallicity massive stars is discussed in
more details in the next chapters (especially in Sect. 2.5.3 and 3.3 ).

### 1.4 Observable signatures of the early generations of massive stars

We have many images of the Universe when it was older than a billion
year. With the Cosmic Microwave Background, we also have a picture of
the Universe when it was only 380000 years old. One big challenge today
is to obtain pictures in between these two periods, when the primordial
Universe started to evolve into the incredibly rich zoo of objects we
see today. To cite loeb10 : “ the situation is similar to having a photo
album of a person that begins with the first ultrasound image of him or
her as an unborn baby and then skip to some additional photos of his or
her years as teenager and adult ”.

The first generations of massive stars in the Universe have specific
signatures that one can look for to reveal their nature. The present
work focuses on one of these signatures (the metal-poor stars) but the
list below includes also other observables, for completeness.

#### Integrated light of high redshift galaxies

Thousands of very distant galaxies with redshift @xmath have been
observed (e.g. bouwens07 ; bouwens09 ; oesch10 ; mclure10 ) . The most
distant object observed today is a galaxy, GN-z11, with @xmath ,
possibly formed @xmath Myr after the Big Bang ( oesch16 ) . In the
future, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) might be able to detect up
to a thousand star-bursting galaxies with @xmath ( pawlik11 ) . Their
colors and spectra could be compared with predictions of the integrated
light coming from such objects in order to interpret these observations
in terms of stellar populations (e.g. schaerer02 ; Salvaterra11 ) .

Abundance determination of high-z objects is challenging. Past and
current observations managed to evaluate the abundances of a few
elements (generally C, N, O, Si) of @xmath objects. These objects are
mostly damped Lyman @xmath (DLA) systems with @xmath (e.g. lehner16 ) .
In general, the metallicity of such objects is estimated from
considerations on the nebular emission lines formed in ionized gas at
the sites of star formation (e.g. pettini04 ; pettini08iau ) . To date,
the most metal-poor DLA system is at @xmath and has [C/H] @xmath , [O/H]
@xmath , [Si/H] @xmath and [Fe/H] @xmath ( cooke17 ) .

One difficulty regarding high- @xmath objects is that most of the metal
lines are redshifted to the infrared range (by a factor of @xmath ), a
regime where the sky background is high. In space, although the current
telescopes cannot reach the far infrared region (the Hubble Space
Telescope, HST, goes up to @xmath @xmath m), JWST should reach @xmath
@xmath m, which may allow to detect the metal lines of very high- @xmath
objects.

#### Reionization

As the first stars formed and radiated energy, the Universe reverted
from being neutral, to being ionized once again. At the epoch of
reionization and before significant expansion had occurred, the free
electron density in the Universe was high enough for Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) photons to undergo significant Thomson scattering. This
let a detectable imprint on the CMB anisotropy map. Inspection of the
tiny fluctuations in the CMB polarization by the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) first suggested that reionization occured
between @xmath ( kogut03 ) . Nine years of observations by WMAP have
revised this result and suggested a reionization at @xmath ( hinshaw13 )
. More recently, planck16a found that the average redshift at which
reionization occured lies between @xmath and @xmath .

Photons from reionization also altered the excitation state of the 21-cm
hyperfine line of neutral hydrogen (e.g. the reviews of morales10 ;
pritchard12 ) . Models predict that the 21 cm cosmic hydrogen signal
will show an absorption feature at @xmath , coming from the Lyman-
@xmath radiation of the earliest stars. The 21-cm transition is
forbidden but since hydrogen amounts to @xmath % of the gas mass present
in the intergalactic medium, the line intensity is enough to be
detected. The line frequency is @xmath MHz with @xmath the rest-frame
frequency of 1420 MHz. For redshifts @xmath the corresponding
frequencies are @xmath MHz. It corresponds to the radio frequency
domain, making this line is a prime target for present and future radio
interferometers like the Murchison Widefield Array, the Low Frequency
Array or the Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization
Signature (EDGES). Recently, bowman18 reported the detection (with
EDGES) of such an absorption feature peaking at 78 MHz consistent with
expectations for the 21-cm signal induced by stars having existed by 180
million years ( @xmath ) after the Big Bang. Some discrepancies between
this observation and models further suggest that an unknown interaction
between dark matter and baryons occurred at early times ( barkana18 ) .
It may provide new clues on the nature of dark matter.

#### Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Bursts in distant galaxies

Until now, the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst ⁵ ⁵ 5 Gamma-Ray Bursts are sudden
and powerful gamma-ray flashes observed in the Universe, lasting from
0.001 seconds to about 15 minutes. mission ( gehrels04 ) has detected 8
Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) at @xmath (reported in Table 1 of salvaterra15 )
. The [S/H] ratio of the host system of GRB 050904 ( @xmath , kawai06 )
has been inferred to be [S/H] @xmath ( thone13 ) , suggesting a
sub-solar metallicity for this object. It remains nevertheless still far
from the zero or extremely low metallicity Universe. The fact that the
metallicity is likely already rather high at @xmath somewhat supports
the idea of a rapid enrichment in metals. The next generation of space
and ground telescopes, such as JWST, the European Extremely-Large
Telescope (E-ELT) or the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) may not be able
to directly see individual first stars ( pawlik11 ) . Even if such stars
are gravitationally lensed, their detection will remain extremely
challenging ( Rydberg13 ) . The explosion of the first massive stars, on
the other hand, should be observable with the next generation of
telescopes ( tanaka13 ; whalen13c ; whalen13a ; whalen13b ) .

#### Gravitational waves

The first stars were likely top-heavy and retained a significant part of
their mass because of weaker stellar winds. As a consequence, they could
have produced massive black holes (BH) that released gravitational waves
(GW) if two of them merged. Recent results suggested that the GW
background coming from Pop III binary black holes mergers might be
detectable by Advanced LIGO/VIRGO detectors ( kinugawa14 ; inayoshi16 )
.

GW150914 was the first direct detection of gravitational waves. The
signal came from the coalescence of a binary BH merger whose components
had masses of @xmath and @xmath @xmath ( abbott16 ) . Cosmological
simulations of hartwig16 show that there is a probability of @xmath %
that GW150914 is of primordial origin. These simulations also suggest
that Advanced LIGO could detect @xmath primordial BH-BH merger per year.
The GW background from the explosion of the first massive stars might
also be detectable but with the next-generation space GW detectors, like
the Decihertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) and
the Big Bang Observer (BBO, sandick06 ; suwa07 ; marassi09 ) .

#### Pockets of primordial material

Pockets of primordial gas might be observable in the very distant
Universe, but possibly also in the relatively local Universe if such
pockets escaped metal pollution. fumagalli11 have observed two gas
clouds at @xmath with no discernible elements heavier than hydrogen. The
derived upper limit for the metallicity is @xmath @xmath . simcoe12 have
reported the discovery of another similar cloud at @xmath . Such gas
clouds might be used as laboratories to probe the formation of
metal-free stars. However, in such clouds, the stellar formation process
may be different from the formation process of true Pop III stars,
formed at the beginning of the Universe: in the early Universe, it is
the mass of the cloud that triggers the collapse and the star formation
process. In the more mature Universe, a cloud is believed to collapse
because of one of several events (e.g. nearby supernovae, collision of
molecular clouds…) that compress the cloud and initiate its
gravitational collapse. The way the star formation process is triggered
may change the initial stellar characteristics (e.g. initial mass).

#### Nucleosynthetic imprints in low-mass metal-poor stars

As discussed in Sect. 1.1.1 , Big Bang nucleosynthesis formed almost
only H and He. The first metals were created and released by the first
stars. As time proceeded, successive generations of stars formed,
evolved and exploded as supernovae, releasing more and more metals in
the Universe (see Fig. 1.6 for a schematic view). A consequence is that
the global metallicity in the Universe increases with time. It also
implies that the metallicity of a star can be used as a proxy for its
age. From this consideration follows the assumption that the most
metal-poor stars are the oldest stars and then the best candidates to
probe the beginning of the stellar era ⁶ ⁶ 6 This assumption is however
challenged by recent works suggesting that more metal-rich stars (in the
Galactic bulge) are better candidates (see the next point). . While
massive metal-poor stars have short lifetimes and are then long dead,
low-mass metal-poor stars that formed very early may still be alive
around us, and hence observable. These low-mass and very metal-poor
stars likely formed with the material ejected by the first short-lived
massive stars. On the opposite, the Sun, which was born about 9 Gyr
after the Big Bang, formed with a more metal rich material, processed by
different generations of stars.

The quest for the most metal-deficient stars in our neighborhood, called
stellar archaeology, has started with the HK-survey ( beers85 ; beers92
) and the Hambourg/ESO survey ( wisotzki96 ) . These surveys discovered
a population of metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo. A significant
fraction of these stars, especially the most iron-poor, are enriched in
carbon (they are called Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor or CEMP stars,
beers05 , see also Chapter 2 ) . Nowadays, several thousands of
metal-poor stars are known, some of them possibly having an age close to
the age of the Universe (e.g. sneden96 ; sneden08 ) . This opened a new
window on the first stars: the chemical composition of the most
metal-poor stars delivers valuable clues on the first nucleosynthetic
events that took place in the Universe, hence on the nature of early
massive stars. Chapter 2 discusses metal-poor stars in more detail.

#### Nucleosynthetic imprints in the metal-poor stars of the Galactic
bulge

The star formation rate is likely more intense in the bulge than in the
other parts of the Milky Way. It implies that the metal content
increased more rapidly so that there is a different metallicity-age
relation in the bulge compared to the Galactic halo. A given metallicity
likely corresponds to an earlier age in the bulge than in the halo.
Using a chemodynamical model that mimics the formation of the Milky Way,
tumlinson10 suggested that of all the stars with very little metals
(less than 1/1000 of the solar metallicity), those found in the central
regions of the Galaxy were more likely to have formed earlier. It is
however very challenging to find metal-poor stars in the bulge since
this is the place in the Galaxy where the average metallicity is the
highest (the most metal-rich stars known are in the bulge). Another
difficulty is that the bulge is a crowded region with high extinction
due to dust, making observations more difficult. Finally, the large
distance to the bulge (around 8.5 kpc) precludes the observation of too
faint stars, unless they are gravitationally microlensed ( bensby13 ) .

The globular cluster (GC) NGC 6522 (first observed by baade46 ) , is an
interesting metal-poor object located in the bulge. The low metal
content derived from the spectra of 8 stars in this GC (about 1 tenth of
the solar metallicity, barbuy09 ) suggests that this GC is old. Images
from HST were obtained for this cluster and compared to isochrones (
kerber18 ) . The derived age is @xmath Gyr. High abundances of s-element
(Y and Sr) were also detected, possibly pointing towards a signature of
massive rotating stars, that enriched the original gas from which the GC
formed ( chiappini11 ) .

### 1.5 Overview of this thesis

The aim of the present work is to get clues on the nature of the early
generations of massive stars. Informations on these short-lived hence
long-dead massive stars are obtained by combining predictions from
stellar evolution models including rotation with the observation of
metal-poor low-mass stars observed in the halo of the Milky Way.

Chapter 2 reviews the observational steps to get abundances from
metal-poor stars as well as the scenarios for the origin of the peculiar
Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars. The mixing & fallback and
spinstar scenarios are discussed in detail.

Chapter 3 discusses the theoretical and modeling aspects of massive
stellar evolution that are relevant for this work. The specificities of
low metallicity models are stressed. The physical ingredients used
and/or implemented in the stellar evolution code are presented. A study
on the effect of axions on Pop III stars is also included.

Chapter 4 and 5 are the main results of this thesis. The origin of the
CEMP (mainly CEMP-no and CEMP-s) stars is investigated using predictions
from new massive stellar models I have computed. Chapter 4 investigates
the origin of the most iron-poor CEMP stars, generally not significantly
enriched in s- and/or r-elements. A simplified nucleosynthesis model is
first used and compared to observations. Then, massive source star
models are computed, their physics (especially nucleosynthesis) is
discussed before comparing the chemical composition of their ejecta to
observations. Chapter 5 extends the investigation by following the
s-process in massive source star models. New confrontations between
source star models including extended nucleosynthesis and observations
of CEMP stars enriched in s-elements are presented.

Chapter 6 summarizes the main results of this work, goes to the
conclusions and considers the perspectives.

## Chapter 2 CEMP stars: observations and origins

This chapter reviews observational aspects and existing scenarios for
the origin of CEMP stars. Metal-poor stars are first discussed before
going into the special case of CEMP stars. What are the observational
and modeling steps to obtain their abundances? What are the
specificities of CEMP stars? Can these chemically peculiar stars be
explained by internal mixing processes? If no, what kind of external
sources should be invoked?

### 2.1 Generalities on metal-poor stars

Observing the oldest stars is a crucial task to better understand the
early Universe. As a first step, it seems natural to wonder whether some
stars born very early could live for long enough to be still alive today
and around us. At first order, the lifetime of a star @xmath is equal to
the mass of fuel available divided by the stellar luminosity. It yields

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the mass-luminosity (ML) relationship @xmath is used. Setting a
standard value of @xmath leads to lifetimes of 17.5 and 13 Gyr for 0.8
and 0.9 @xmath stars, respectively. It means that nowadays, stars with
mass @xmath @xmath that formed early in the Universe are still alive,
hence possibly observable.

As discussed in Sect. 1.4 , the metallicity of a star can be used as a
proxy for its age. As a consequence, the oldest stars may be searched
among the most metal-poor stars. However, determining the metallicity Z
at the surface of a star would require to determine the abundance of all
elements heavier than helium, which is not possible. Iron is often taken
as an indicator of the metallicity of a star since it is one of the most
abundant and easily measurable element in a stellar spectrum. It can be
obtained from every observed star. The iron content at the surface of a
star is given with the [Fe/H] ratio. For two elements X and Y one has

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath and @xmath the number density ¹ ¹ 1 In the Sun, @xmath (
asplund09 ) meaning that for each iron atom there are 32000 hydrogen
atoms. of elements X and Y. For instance, [Fe/H] @xmath corresponds to
an iron abundance of 1/10000 that of the Sun. This notation requires the
abundances of the observed star and the ones of the Sun, taken as a
reference. chamberlain51 first reported a deficiency in iron for 2
stars: HD19445 and HD140283. They derived values of [Fe/H] @xmath and
@xmath . Nowadays, several hundreds of stars with [Fe/H] @xmath are
known. Eight stars with [Fe/H] @xmath were observed (listed in the Table
1 of frebel15 ) . The spectra of the Sun and 3 stars with decreasing
[Fe/H] ratios are shown in Fig. 2.1 . We clearly see the decreasing line
strength with decreasing metallicity. We also see that at very low
metallicity, the iron line is the (or among the) strongest lines.

beers05 first established a classification of metal-poor stars based on
the [Fe/H] ratio (Table 2.1 ). According to this terminology, iron-poor
stars are classified as metal-poor stars. Rigorously, this association
is correct as long as all the abundances (compared to the Sun) of a
given iron-poor star scale down like iron, i.e. if a star having [Fe/H]
@xmath has also [X/H] @xmath (where X are all metals). For instance, an
iron-poor star with [Fe/H] @xmath and [X/H] @xmath (where X are all
metals except iron) is iron-poor but not metal-poor. It will have a
super-solar metallicity. However, observations of iron-poor stars show
that, in general, other metals roughly scale down in proportion to iron.
Notable exceptions, which are the object of this thesis, nevertheless
exist: some iron-poor stars are strongly enhanced in other metals and
then their chemical pattern is highly non-solar (cf. Sect. 2.3 ). But
even in such extreme cases, the star very likely stays metal-poor. As an
illustrative example, a star with [X/H] @xmath (X are all metals) has a
total metallicity @xmath . Taking the same star but with [C/H] @xmath
(equivalent to [C/Fe] @xmath ) gives @xmath , which is @xmath times
lower than @xmath . It shows that even if some metals are strongly
enhanced in iron-poor stars, one can securely guess that the total metal
content of an iron-poor star stays low (except in very rare cases ² ² 2
Taking the same star as before but this time with [C/H] @xmath
(equivalent to [C/Fe] @xmath ) will have @xmath . Such kind of stars
with very little iron but with @xmath are extremely rare. HE 1045-1434 (
beers07 ) and SDSS J1245-0738 ( bonifacio15 ) , with respectively [Fe/H]
@xmath and [C/Fe] @xmath , and [Fe/H] @xmath and [C/Fe] @xmath , may
belong to this rare class of stars. ). This said, it is important to
keep in mind that the most iron-poor stars are not necessarily the most
metal-poor stars.

As a final remark, let us mention that the direct association of the
lack of metals with the stellar age is not straightforward. For
instance, some metal-poor stars could have formed later in isolated
pockets of interstellar material that remained metal-poor. Also, some
more metal-rich stars could have form early if the star formation rate
(hence steepness of age-metallicity relation) was very high.
Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the age of some very metal-poor
stars was determined owing to the detection of radioactive elements like
Th and U at their surface. @xmath U and @xmath Th have half lives of
about 4.5 and 14 Gyr respectively. Assuming that Th and U were
synthesized before the birth of the metal-poor star and supposing that
the initial abundances of Th and U are known, one can compare the
initial abundances of Th and U to the observed abundances to estimate
the age of the star. Ages of about @xmath Gyr were derived for several
metal-poor stars with [Fe/H] @xmath ( hill02 ; sneden03 ; frebel07b ) .
It gives some support to the fundamental hypothesis of stellar
archaeology stating that very metal-poor stars are very old stars. The
uncertainties related to this dating method are however large (several
Gyr). It is mainly because our understanding of the nuclear processes
responsible for the formation of Th is still incomplete (especially the
uncertainties in the nuclear data and unknown thermodynamic conditions
in which the nuclear processes, able to form Th, take place, goriely99 )
.

### 2.2 Observation and abundances of metal-poor stars

Metal-poor stars are very rare objects: in the solar neighborhood, only
@xmath field star would have [Fe/H] @xmath ( frebel15 , see also Table
2.1 ) . How and where to find them in the Milky Way which contains
billion of stars? As schematically shown in Fig. 2.2 , our Galaxy
contains four main components: a thick disk, a thin disk, a bulge and a
spheroidal halo. The disk is about 30 kpc. carollo07 have shown that the
halo can be divided into two broadly overlapping structural components:
the inner (radius @xmath kpc) and outer halo (radius @xmath kpc). These
two components have different spatial density profiles, stellar orbits
and stellar metallicities. The metallicity of the inner and outer halo
peaks at [Fe/H] @xmath and @xmath , respectively. Surveys carried out
over the past decades have shown that the most metal-poor stars are
found in the halo of the Milky Way. It is reviewed below the
observational steps required to efficiently spot the good metal-poor
candidates among the field stars.

#### 2.2.1 The observational steps

The process of getting the surface chemical composition of metal-poor
stars is long. As discussed in the review of beers05 , there are 3 main
observational steps to obtain accurate abundances of metal-poor stars:

-   Step 1 : a wide-angle survey in order to select the metal-poor
    candidates.

-   Step 2 : a moderate-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of the
    candidates to validate their lack of metals.

-   Step 3 : a high-resolution spectroscopy of the most interesting
    candidates to accurately determine the abundances.

Typical spectra obtained from each of these three steps are shown in
Fig. 2.3 . The star is HE 1327-2326 ( frebel05 ; frebel05nat ; frebel06b
; frebel06 ; frebel08 ; aoki06 ) , having [Fe/H] @xmath . From step 1 to
3, the resolution @xmath increases from 400 to 60000. The high
resolution spectroscopy (step 3) was performed with the High Dispersion
Spectrograph ( noguchi02 ) on the 8.2-meter optical-infrared SUBARU
telescope in Hawaii. Below I give some details on these three
observational steps.

##### Step 1 : wide-angle surveys

The first step, finding metal-poor candidates, can be achieved in
different ways.

###### Proper-motion surveys

A significant fraction of halo stars has high proper motion ³ ³ 3 The
proper-motion of a star corresponds to its apparent angular motion
across the sky with respect to more distant stars. compared to Galactic
disk stars. It arises because halo stars have elliptical orbits that are
not in the Galactic plane (i.e. very different orbits than disk stars
like the Sun) and because halo stars have typically larger space
velocities than disk stars. This last point implies that a halo star
will likely have a higher proper motion than a disc star at the same
distance. schwarzschild50 and roman50 first suggested a possible
correlation between the space velocity of stars and the weakness of
their lines (attributed to the lack of metals in their atmosphere).
These pioneering works motivated further studies that confirmed the
connection between the kinematics of stars and their abundances:
metal-poor stars are preferentially found among the stars with a high
space velocity. For instance, the first star having [Fe/H] @xmath
(G64-12) was discovered by carney81 as the result of its high space
velocity. ryan91 carried out a large spectroscopic follow-up of a sample
of stars with high proper-motion. About 10 % of the sample was found to
have [Fe/H] @xmath .

Among the first surveys measuring proper motion, which were based on
photographic plates, one finds the Lick Northern Proper Motion survey (
klemola87 ) , the Southern Proper Motion survey ( girard98 ) or the
SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey ( hambly01 ) . More recent surveys are the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, york00 , both photometry and spectroscopy) or
the Gaia mission (e.g perryman01 ) .

###### Colorimetric surveys

The metals (particularly Fe) in the atmospheres of stars absorb
preferentially the blue light so that metal-rich stars appear redder
while metal-poor stars appear bluer. The color of a star and more
specifically the ultraviolet excess @xmath can be used as a metallicity
indicator (e.g. the early works of wallerstein60 ; wildey62 ) .

The SkyMapper Southern Sky Survey (SMSS, keller07 ) is a photometric
program of the Southern Hemisphere started in 2008 and giving accurate
estimates of atmospheric parameters of metal-poor stars (effective
temperature, surface gravity and stellar metallicity). This survey led
to the discovery of the most metal-poor star currently known: SM
0313-6708 with [Fe/H] @xmath ( keller14 ) .

The Pristine survey ( starkenburg17 ) is a photometric survey using a
narrow filter with a width of @xmath Å that covers the wavelengths of
the Ca doublet lines (at 3968.5 and 3933.7 Å). A spectroscopic follow-up
of promising metal-poor candidates selected by the Pristine survey has
led to the discovery of numerous metal-poor stars with [Fe/H] @xmath (
youakim17 ) .

###### Objective-prism surveys

Such surveys are wide-angle spectroscopic surveys with low-resolution (
@xmath 400). The idea is generally to examine the strength of the Ca II
K line so as to obtain a first estimate of the metal content of the
star. bond70 and bidelman73 first carried out such surveys, aiming at
identifying metal-poor stars based on spectroscopy only. The HK survey (
beers85 ; beers92 ) and the Hamburg/ESO (HES) survey ( wisotzki96 ) are
other surveys of this type, that were prolific sources of metal-poor
stars.

After a spectroscopic follow-up of metal-poor candidates selected from
the HK survey, it appeared that 11 % of the candidates had [Fe/H] @xmath
( beers05 ) . A drawback regarding the HK survey is that metal-deficient
cool stars would likely be missed. Indeed, such stars have enhanced
strengths of their Ca II K lines because of the lower temperature and
therefore are considered as metal-rich stars. The HK-II survey ( rhee01
) aimed at identifying the metal-poor red giant cool stars that may have
been missed in the original analysis due to the temperature bias against
cool stars. It allowed to raise the efficiency of the HK survey to
detect metal-poor stars from 11 to 32 %.

The HES survey can observe fainter objects than the HK survey (about 2
magnitude deeper). Because of the broad wavelength range covered (
@xmath against @xmath for the HK survey), the @xmath color of stars can
be directly obtained from the spectra and combined to the spectroscopy
to select metal-poor candidates with more security. A spectrum obtained
from the HES survey is shown on the upper panel of Fig. 2.3 .
Spectroscopic follow-up of metal-poor candidates selected from the HES
survey have shown that @xmath % of the candidates have [Fe/H] @xmath .

##### Step 2 : moderate-resolution spectroscopy

After step 1, a moderate-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of the
candidates is required to validate the metal-poor stars among the
sample. It also exists surveys targeting hundredth thousands of stars
with a moderate-resolution and thus allowing to skip the step 1.

The SDSS survey do both photometry and medium resolution spectroscopy (
@xmath ). SDSS has gone through 3 stages: SDSS-I (from 2000 to 2005),
SDSS-II (from 2005 to 2008) and SDSS-III (from 2008 to 2014,
eisenstein11 ) . SDSS includes several individual surveys, among them
the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE)
survey ( yanny09 ) . The two phases of SEGUE, SEGUE-1 and -2, obtained
spectra for 240000 and 118151 stars, respectively, with typical errors
in @xmath , [Fe/H] and @xmath of 117 K, 0.22 and 0.26 dex, respectively.
SDSS/SEGUE surveys were prolific sources of metal-poor stars (e.g.
fukugita96 ; adelman-McCarthy08 ; abazajian09 ) and motivated numerous
high-resolution observations (e.g. aoki13 , where 137 metal-poor SDSS
candidates were observed with the high dispersion spectrograph of the
Subaru telescope.) .

The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST)
survey ( deng12 ) started in 2008. It should provide spectra for 2.5
million stars. The resolution is about @xmath 1800. This survey also
triggered high-resolution observations. li15 reported @xmath 36000
spectra for two stars with [Fe/H] @xmath , selected in the LAMOST
database.

From 2003 to 2013, the RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE, steinmetz03 )
targeted bright stars ( @xmath , it represents stellar distances up to
@xmath 3 kpc from the Sun). This survey delivered spectra for about
480000 stars with a resolution @xmath . In a RAVE database of
approximately 200000 stars belonging to the Galactic disk or halo,
fulbright10 identified 631 stars with [Fe/H] @xmath ( @xmath 0.3 %). In
the Galactic bulge, the ARGOS survey (Abundances and Radial velocity
Galactic Origins Survey) revealed 16 stars with [Fe/H] @xmath within a
sample of 14150 stars ( @xmath 0.1 %, ness13 ) . In the frame of the
EMBLA (Extremely Metal-poor BuLge stars with AAOmega) survey, howes14 ;
howes15 ; howes16 reported the discovery of about 30 other bulge stars
with [Fe/H] @xmath (among them a star with [Fe/H] @xmath ). No star with
[Fe/H] @xmath was found in the bulge.

##### Step 3 : high-resolution spectroscopy

Once the promising candidates are identified, the next step consists in
obtaining high-resolution (R @xmath 30000), high S/N (signal-to-noise)
spectra.

Numerous studies conducted high-resolution spectroscopic observations on
metal-poor star candidates, originally selected from the HE, HK, SDSS or
SEGUE surveys (e.g. mcwilliam95 ; carretta02 ; cohen04 ; cohen08 ;
cohen13 ; barklem05 ; aoki07 ; aoki13 ; hollek11 ; caffau11 ;
bonifacio12 ; norris13 ; yong13 ; roederer14a ; hansen14 ) . There are
at least three public database, grouping the abundances of metal-poor
stars derived from high-resolution spectra:

-   The SAGA database ⁴ ⁴ 4 http://sagadatabase.jp . ( suda08 ) .

-   The frebel10 database ⁵ ⁵ 5 http://www.metalpoorstars.com . .

-   The JINAbase ⁶ ⁶ 6 http://jinabase.pythonanywhere.com . (
    abohalima17 ) .

Among the future high resolution surveys one finds 4MOST (e.g.
feltzing17 ) , WEAVE, a spectrograph that will offer two possible
resolutions: 5000 and 20000 or GALAH (Galactic Archaeology with the
HERMES spectrograph martell16proc ) which aims at collecting R @xmath
28000 spectra for one million stars in the Milky Way.

#### 2.2.2 Abundances and uncertainties

Once a high-resolution spectrum is acquired from a star, the abundances
in term of numbers have to be determined (e.g. [X/Fe] ratios). This is a
highly nontrivial task that required a realistic stellar atmosphere
model. Stellar abundances are therefore not observed but deduced by
modeling the spectral lines. The stellar abundances are generally
determined by inspection of the equivalent width of spectral absorption
lines. The observational uncertainty varies as @xmath / (S/N) where FWHM
is the full width at half maximum of the line. A spectrograph with a
high resolving power and a high S/N minimizes the uncertainties,
allowing the detection of weaker features, which is primordial when
observing stars with little metals, hence with weak lines.

A perfect atmosphere model would be a 3D model taking into account
departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and where all the
atomic and molecular physics (determining the absorption lines) is
included. Such a model does not exist. Often, abundances are derived
using a 1D LTE model.

frebel08 , have estimated by how much the abundances are affected when
deriving the abundances with either a 1D or a 3D model. They
investigated the star HE 1327-2326 ([Fe/H] @xmath ). They found a 3D-1D
correction for C, N and O of about @xmath dex.

ezzeddine17 studied anew the stellar parameters of 20 stars with [Fe/H]
@xmath using a 1D NLTE (non LTE) atmosphere model instead of a 1D LTE
model. They derived [Fe/H] corrections up to 1 dex compared to the 1D
LTE case. These corrections are larger at lower [Fe/H]: at [Fe/H] @xmath
and @xmath , the corrections are about 0.5 and 1 dex respectively.
lind12 reported a similar trend: they derived NTLE corrections of @xmath
and @xmath dex at solar and low metallicity, respectively. Also, these
corrections apply only for the derivation of Fe abundances from neutral
lines (Fe I ). The corrections are mostly insignificant if using Fe II
lines. Determining the Fe abundance with accuracy is important since it
is generally a prerequisite for the determination of the abundance of
other elements.

### 2.3 CEMP stars as peculiar metal-poor stars

This section aims at describing the characteristics of CEMP stars. Their
possible origin is discussed in the next section.

A natural guess could be that in metal-poor stars, all metals are scaled
down compared to the Sun by roughly the same factor. However,
observations progressively revealed that metal-poor stars generally have
non-solar-like abundance patterns. In particular, the carbon to iron
ratio is super-solar in many metal-poor stars. The first carbon stars
were observed about 150 years ago by Angelo Secchi ( secchi1868 ) . At
that time, he only reported a peculiar banding in the stellar spectra.
These stars were later identified by rufus16 as stars enriched in
carbon. Since, many carbon-rich stars were discovered, particularly
among the most iron-poor stars. Stars enriched in carbon and depleted in
iron were called Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP, beers05 ) . This name
might seem somewhat contradictory since carbon is a metal. However, CEMP
stars likely stay metal-poor compared to the Sun, even if they show
overabundances in carbon or other metals (cf. discussion in Sect. 2.1 ).
beers05 proposed two criteria defining a CEMP star: [Fe/H] @xmath and
[C/Fe] @xmath . The criterium of [C/Fe] @xmath is also often used in the
literature (first proposed by aoki07 ) . For what follows, depending on
the criterium used by the considered author, I use the names

-   CEMP @xmath if the condition is [C/Fe] @xmath .

-   CEMP @xmath if the condition is [C/Fe] @xmath .

##### Are CEMP stars enriched in other elements?

CEMP stars have various lithium abundances, from ⁷ ⁷ 7 A(X) = @xmath =
@xmath , where X represents a given element. A(Li) @xmath (i.e. close to
the Spite plateau of @xmath , spite82 ) to A(Li) @xmath for HE 1327-2326
with [Fe/H] @xmath ( frebel08 ) . Some observational works have
suggested a melt-down of the Spite plateau below [Fe/H] @xmath ( aoki09
; sbordone10 ; bonifacio12 ) . The melt-down has nevertheless to be
further confirmed since some iron-poor stars could have experienced
severe surface Li depletion episodes (especially those who are giants).
korn09 have computed models of the star HE 1327-2326 including the
effects of atomic diffusion. They predict a maximal Li depletion of 1.2
dex from the birth of the star to the present day. It gives a maximal
initial Li abundance of about 1.8, which is much closer to the Spite
plateau. Other scenarios in the same work predict a milder Li depletion,
of the order of 0.2 dex, which would give an initial Li well below the
Spite plateau. In any case, these initial Li abundances are not
compatible with the WMAP-based primordial Li abundance of 2.63 predicted
from primordial nucleosynthesis ( spergel07 ) .

Many CEMP stars have high N/Fe, O/Fe, Na/Fe or Mg/Fe ratios. For stars
with [Fe/H] @xmath 3, the scatter of the [X/Fe] ratios globally
decreases from X @xmath C to Ca ( frebel15 ) . For instance, the [C/Fe],
[O/Fe], [Na/Fe], [Mg/Fe] and [Ca/Fe] ratios span about 5, 4, 2.5, 1.5
and 0.5 dex, respectively (see Fig. 2.4 ).

A significant amount of CEMP stars are also enriched in elements heavier
than iron. These elements are thought to be mostly synthesized through
the slow and rapid neutron capture processes (also the intermediate
process or i-process, see Sect. 2.5 ). aoki00 and vaneck01 discovered
the first VMP stars enriched in Pb. Many other CEMP stars enriched in s-
and/or r-elements were discovered, down to [Fe/H] @xmath ( burris00 ;
simmerer04 ; sivarani04 ; lai07 ; placco13 ) . Below this threshold,
enhancements in s- and r- elements are generally very modest (see Fig.
LABEL:12ab ).

beers05 established a classification of CEMP stars based on their heavy
element abundances (see Table 2.2 ). One finds CEMP stars enriched in
s-elements (CEMP-s), r-elements (CEMP-r), both r- and s-elements
(CEMP-r/s) and without significant enhancement in s-/r-elements
(CEMP-no). As they note, this classification should be viewed as a first
approximation and used as a guideline for the future. Indeed, the
location of the class boundaries are somewhat arbitrary and in some
cases, it may exist a continuity between the classes rather that very
distinct groups. Eu and Ba were chosen to define such classes because
(1) they are generally readily measurable in a stellar spectrum and (2)
they are expected to be produced in a different amount by the s- and
r-process (Eu: mainly r-process, Ba: mainly s-process). It has been
shown (especially yoon16 ) that CEMP-no stars are generally found on the
low carbon band with A(C) @xmath 7.1 and CEMP-s/rs on the high carbon
band with A(C) @xmath 7.1. It might be linked to the different formation
channel for CEMP-no and CEMP-s/rs stars (Sect. 2.5 ). Interestingly,
this separation into 2 bands, allows (with some level of confidence) to
classify CEMP stars only based on their C abundance rather on e.g. Ba,
whose abundance determination requires much higher resolution spectra.
Fig. LABEL:12ab shows that CEMP-s stars mainly lie at [Fe/H] @xmath
(green symbols). CEMP-no stars (blue symbols) are generally found at
lower [Fe/H]. Some CEMP stars (magenta symbols) are still unclassified,
according to the criteria of Table 2.2 .

##### Are CEMP stars frequent?

carbon87 and norris97 first emitted the possibility of a higher
frequency of C-rich stars with decreasing [Fe/H]. marsteller05 reported
a possibly high fraction of about 50 % of CEMP @xmath stars ⁸ ⁸ 8 I
remind here that CEMP @xmath means that the author used the condition
[C/Fe] @xmath for a star to be CEMP. CEMP @xmath means that the author
used the condition [C/Fe] @xmath . among [Fe/H] @xmath stars selected in
the HES survey. However, cohen05 showed that the [Fe/H] ratio of some
stars in the HES survey was overestimated by @xmath dex. Consequently,
they derived a CEMP @xmath fraction of @xmath 4 % (instead of 50 %)
among the stars with [Fe/H] @xmath . In 240 stars with [Fe/H] @xmath ,
lucatello06 found a CEMP @xmath fraction of 21 @xmath %. lee13
considered a sample from SDSS/SEGUE of about 247000 stars and found that
12 % of [Fe/H] @xmath stars are CEMP @xmath .

One of the possible bias to these frequencies is that in giant stars,
the first dredge-up has occurred. Amongst other, it changes the surface
carbon abundance (cf. Sect. 2.4 ). For a sample of 505 stars with [Fe/H]
@xmath , placco14c have estimated the effect of the first dredge-up on
the surface carbon abundance. The recognized CEMP stars enriched in s-
and/or r-elements were excluded from their analysis ⁹ ⁹ 9 Note that this
does not mean that all stars they consider are CEMP-no. Some CEMP stars
in the sample without a determined Ba abundance might appear to be
CEMP-s, -r/s or -r in the future. . The stellar models they used predict
that the correction on the [C/Fe] ratio induced by the first dredge-up
is generally about 0.5 dex for the evolved stars. They recovered the
initial [C/Fe] ratio of the 505 stars of their sample (the initial ratio
is higher in case the star has experienced the first dredge-up). They
finally found that 20, 43 and 81 % of stars with [Fe/H] @xmath , @xmath
and @xmath are CEMP @xmath , respectively. The first dredge-up effect
corrected, it likely gives the fraction of stars which were born as CEMP
@xmath .

There is also a spatial variation of the CEMP frequency: carollo12 have
shown that the CEMP @xmath frequency is increasing with the distance to
the Galactic plane. Almost all CEMP @xmath stars belong to the halo and
the fraction is higher in the outer than in the inner halo. Considering
the most distant stars (more than 9 kpc from the Galactic plane, i.e.
mainly in the outer halo), they derived a CEMP @xmath frequency of 20 %.
carollo14 reported a fraction of CEMP-no stars of 43 and 70 % in the
inner and outer halo respectively. For the CEMP-s stars, they found 57
and 30 % in the inner and outer halo respectively. It suggests that the
dominant source of CEMP stars in the two halo components were different.
A recent study suggested that the CEMP fraction (among the [Fe/H] @xmath
stars and after excluding the likely CEMP-s and -r/s stars) in the
Sculptor dwarf galaxy is @xmath ( chiti18 ) , i.e. similar to the @xmath
of the Galactic halo ( placco14c ) .

##### Are CEMP stars in binary systems?

lucatello05 and starkenburg14 showed that the whole sample of CEMP-s
stars is consistent with the hypothesis of them all existing in binary
systems. A careful monitoring of the radial velocity of 22 CEMP-s stars
over several years has revealed a clear orbital motion for 18 stars (
@xmath ) while 4 stars appeared to be single ( hansen16a ) . The
probability of finding one face-on system in their sample is about
@xmath , meaning that it is extremely unlikely that all the four
apparently single CEMP-s stars are in fact binary systems that were seen
face-on. Apparently single stars might nevertheless have a companion
with a long orbital period (about @xmath days at minimum), which would
prevent to detect radial motions of the CEMP-s stars. A similar study
was carried out for CEMP-r and CEMP-no stars. The binary frequency was
found to be @xmath for CEMP-r ( hansen15a ) and @xmath for CEMP-no stars
( hansen16b ) , i.e. much lower than for CEMP-s stars. It suggests that
the CEMP-r and CEMP-no stars are likely disconnected from a binary
origin.

### 2.4 Internal mixing processes in CEMP stars

CEMP stars formed with the material ejected by previous stars (at least
some of it). One may see the nucleosynthetic signature from these
previous stellar generations in the CEMP star surface chemical
composition. However, the CEMP star surface composition can be altered
during the life of the CEMP star itself. If this alteration is important
enough, it could erase the chemical imprint let by the previous star(s).
Two different categories of processes can affect the surface abundances
of CEMP stars: external and internal processes.

-   External processes can be accretion of interstellar material or
    accretion of material from a binary companion. While accretion of
    interstellar material was found to not have a significant effect on
    metal-poor stars ( frebel09 ; johnson11 ) , the accretion of
    material ejected by a companion is certainly an important process,
    especially for CEMP-s stars (cf. Sect. 2.5.1 ).

-   Internal processes happen in the CEMP star itself. There are for
    instance the first dredge-up or thermohaline mixing.

Below it is discussed the main (known) internal mixing processes that
can happen in CEMP stars and possibly alter their surface composition. A
sample of CEMP stars is considered and compared with low-mass stellar
models. The sample comprises the CEMP stars with [C/Fe] @xmath and
[Fe/H] @xmath . The CEMP stars enriched in s- and/or r-elements are
excluded ¹⁰ ¹⁰ 10 This likely excludes most of the CEMP stars whose
surface abundances were modified because of the accretion of material
from a companion (especially the CEMP-s stars, see Sect. 2.5.1 ). .

###### The first dredge-up.

Stellar models predict that as a low-mass star runs out of hydrogen, its
envelope expands, the surface temperature decreases, making the star
evolving to the red giant branch (RGB). During that stage, the outer
convective envelope expands inward and penetrates hotter regions, where
the CN-cycle is active. Some CN-processed material is consequently
brought to the surface and alters the star’s surface light element
abundances. This mixing episode is called the first dredge-up ( iben64 )
. Since the CN-cycle mainly transforms @xmath C into @xmath N and to a
lesser extent into @xmath C, the effect of the first dredge-up is to
decrease the surface C/N and @xmath C/ @xmath C ratios. charbonnel94 has
shown that if starting with @xmath C/ @xmath C @xmath and @xmath C/
@xmath N @xmath (equivalent to [C/N @xmath ]) in a 1 @xmath model at
@xmath , the first dredge-up decreases @xmath C/ @xmath C and @xmath C/
@xmath N to about 25 and 2 (equivalent to [C/N] @xmath ) respectively.
In the top panels of Fig. 2.5 the surface @xmath C/ @xmath C and [C/N]
ratios along the evolution of a standard low metallicity 0.85 @xmath
model are shown. The first dredge-up occurs at @xmath and @xmath and
decreases the surface @xmath C/ @xmath C from about 70 to 45. The [C/N]
ratio is barely affected by the first dredge-up (top right panel).
Dredge-up events generally cannot explain CEMP stars since (1) they tend
to deplete the carbon while we look for the opposite and (2) some CEMP
stars are still unevolved (Fig. 2.5 ) meaning that they did not
experienced any dredge-up episode. Quantifying this process for each
CEMP star is nevertheless important in order to correct the surface
abundances of evolved stars and recover their initial surface
abundances, that reflect more directly the abundances in their natal
cloud. This was done in placco14c for the carbon abundance. Their CEMP
stellar models suggest that the first dredge-up correction on the
surface C abundance is about 0.5 dex (0.8 dex in the most extreme case).

###### Thermohaline mixing and rotation.

Thermohaline mixing occurs after the first dredge-up so that unevolved
CEMP stars are not affected by this process (provided they do not
accrete heavy material from a companion, cf. Sect. 2.5.1 ). Thermohaline
mixing can occur in giant stars because of an inversion of the molecular
weight around the top of the H-burning shell, just below the convective
envelope. The negative @xmath ( @xmath , the mean molecular weight, is
growing outward) results in a mixing event, following the first
dredge-up, and decreasing again the C/N and @xmath C/ @xmath C ratios
(e.g. charbonnel07 ; eggleton08 ) . Rotation transports the H-burning
products outwards. It likely adds another mechanism to decrease the
surface C/N and @xmath C/ @xmath C ratios. The bottom panels of Fig. 2.5
show the surface @xmath C/ @xmath C and [C/N] ratios during the
evolution of a low metallicity 0.85 @xmath model including thermohaline
mixing and rotation. In this case, the surface ratios are significantly
reduced, particularly near the end of the evolution, where @xmath C/
@xmath C @xmath and [C/N] @xmath . According to these models, some of
the evolved CEMP stars shown in Fig. 2.5 may have experienced an
important modification of their surface C and N abundances (cf. also the
work of stancliffe09 ) . Among the unevolved CEMP stars, some have low
@xmath C/ @xmath C ratios, like HE 1029-0546 with @xmath C/ @xmath C
@xmath (triangle in Fig. 2.5 , hansen15 ) . Some other unevolved stars
have low [C/N] ratios like CS 29528-041 with [C/N] @xmath (square in
Fig. 2.5 , sivarani06 ) . These low ratios likely cannot be explained by
internal processes. Such ratios probably reflect some processes at work
in external sources (e.g. previous massive stars).

###### Atomic diffusion.

Such a process has the effect of separating the elements. It groups
together the effects of gravitational settling, thermal diffusion and
radiative acceleration ( michaud15 ) . richard02 predicted that atomic
diffusion can alter the surface composition of metal-poor stars by
@xmath dex. It depends on the chemical species considered, effective
temperature and the evolutionary stage. For C, O, Na, Mg, Al and Si, the
alteration does not exceed 0.5 dex, except in some hot models ( @xmath
6300 K). richard02 have also shown that the impact of atomic diffusion
becomes very small (about @xmath dex) if including an additional
turbulence effect that is required to account for the chemical anomalies
of some stars (the AmFm stars, richer00 ) .

Overall, although internal processes in CEMP stars can modify their
surface abundances, these processes likely cannot account for the
unevolved or relatively unevolved CEMP stars. For the most evolved CEMP
stars, internal mixing processes might have erased the initial surface
chemical composition (hence the signature of previous stellar
generations) for some elements like C or N. An important work would be
to compute a grid of CEMP stellar models including various mixing
processes in order to quantify the degree of mixing experienced by each
observed evolved CEMP star. The aim would be to recover the initial
surface abundances of all elements. Such a correction would give the
chemical composition of the CEMP natal cloud. It will establish a more
direct link between the evolved CEMP stars and the ejecta of the
previous generation of stars.

### 2.5 The origin of CEMP stars: external sources

The origin of the CEMP stars is closely linked to the origin of the
elements. When investigating the origin of CEMP stars, the aim is
generally to find what is the astrophysical source able to provide the
carbon, nitrogen, s-, r-elements…

It really seems that external sources are needed to explain the
peculiarities of CEMP stars. The external sources can be objects that
lived before and enriched the cloud in which the CEMP star formed and/or
companions stars that transferred material to the (future) CEMP star. In
this global frame, the existing scenarios for the origin of the
different classes of CEMP stars are discussed below.

#### 2.5.1 CEMP-s stars

Near the end of their lives, stars with initial masses between about 1
and 8 @xmath evolve to the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). AGB stars are
known to be at the origin of the main s-process component (cf. Sect. 3.2
) and also to produce light elements such as carbon. Are CEMP-s AGB
stars? Actually no: many CEMP-s stars are still rather unevolved and
therefore do not have gone through the AGB phase, where s-elements can
be produced. The main scenario (see Fig. 2.6 for a schematic view)
considers that CEMP-s were born as @xmath @xmath normal stars (i.e. not
C-rich, not s-rich) in a binary system with a more massive companion
(e.g. 1.5 @xmath ). During its AGB stage, the companion produces and
ejects through winds a material enriched in light and s-elements. Some
of the wind material is accreted by the companion, that becomes a CEMP-s
star. The AGB star ends its life as a white dwarf.

In the scenario described above, the mechanism for the transfer of mass
is wind mass transfer. The transfer of mass may indeed preferentially
occur through wind accretion rather than through Roche-lobe ¹¹ ¹¹ 11 The
Roche-lobe is a distinctively shaped region that surrounds a star in a
binary system. In this region, the material is gravitationally bound to
the star. If the primary exceeds the Roche-lobe radius, some material
can flow towards the secondary. overflow because when the donor is an
AGB star, Roche-lobe overflow may be unstable ( paczynski65 ) and brings
the system to the common envelope phase. In this phase, 3D hydrodynamic
simulations suggest that accretion is very inefficient ( ricker08 ) ,
meaning that the formation of CEMP-s stars might not happen. By
investigating the origin of 15 CEMP-s stars with known orbital periods,
abate15a have shown that the wind mass transfer model generally agrees
well with observations but in most of the cases, the wind accretion rate
should be enhanced by a factor of @xmath to account for the
observations.

Atomic diffusion and thermohaline mixing on CEMP-s stars are important
ingredients that may induce important surface composition changes (e.g.
stancliffe07 ) . The accreting CEMP-s star undergoes thermohaline mixing
because the material coming from the AGB companion has a larger mean
molecular weight than the material at the surface of the accreting
future CEMP-s star ¹² ¹² 12 In this case, thermohaline mixing can occur
during the main sequence. . After the accretion, thermohaline can reduce
the surface carbon abundance in the CEMP-s by @xmath 1 dex (
stancliffe07 ) . A too strong thermohaline would make the s-elements
sink and disappear from the stellar surface. However, if CEMP-s stars
rotate, the horizontal turbulence induced by rotation may reduce or even
kill the thermohaline mixing ( denissenkov08 ; maeder13 ) . Models of
rotating CEMP-s stars computed by matrozis17b supports this view by
showing that even a mild rotational mixing severely inhibits
thermohaline mixing (also atomic diffusion is inhibited).

Worth to mention is also that if a substantial amount of material (hence
angular momentum) is accreted from the AGB companion, the CEMP-s star
should spin up significantly. matrozis17a have shown that @xmath @xmath
can be accreted before the CEMP-s reaches critical rotation and
therefore stops accreting more material. However, more than @xmath
@xmath is often needed to reproduce the chemical composition of observed
CEMP-s stars (e.g. abate15b ; abate15a ) . This said, a generally good
agreement is found between the yields of AGB stars and chemical
composition of CEMP-s stars (with nevertheless several persisting
discrepancies, especially for C, N, F, Na, and @xmath C/ @xmath C, lau09
; stancliffe10 ; bisterzo11 ; bisterzo12 ; lugaro12 ) .

The AGB binary scenario is also well supported by the fact that a large
fraction of CEMP-s stars is in a binary system (cf. Sect. 2.3 ). The
apparently single CEMP-s stars nevertheless challenge this scenario,
even if one can imagine that the single CEMP-s stars have lost their AGB
companion or that they are in a binary system with a very long period,
explaining the non-detection of radial velocity variation.

In general, even if CEMP-s stars are explained with the AGB scenario, it
does not mean that the previous generations of massive stars did not
contribute. Likely, it means that the nucleosynthetic signature let by
the AGB companion on the CEMP-s star is the dominant one and has blurred
the nucleosynthetic signature let by the previous generation of stars.
In Chapter 5 , I investigate whether the nucleosynthetic imprint of
previous massive stars can be identified in CEMP stars enriched in
s-elements.

#### 2.5.2 CEMP-r, -r+s, -r/s, -i stars

The origin of CEMP-r stars is tightly linked to the astrophysical site
for the r-process, which is still unknown. The two main possible
r-process sites are magnetorotationally driven supernovae (MRSNe, e.g.
thielemann11 ; winteler12 ; nishimura15 ) and neutron star (NS) merger
(e.g. symbalisty82 ; freiburghaus99 ; thielemann11 ; thielemann17 ;
wanajo14 ) . Recently, LIGO detected GW170817, the first observed binary
neutron star inspiral ( abbott17 ) . The light curve of the
electromagnetic counterpart was found to be compatible with a NS merging
event producing r-elements ( smartt17 ; pian17 ) .

NS mergers alone may nevertheless face difficulties to explain the most
iron-poor CEMP-r stars (e.g. SM 0248 @xmath 6843 with [Fe/H] @xmath and
[Eu/Fe] @xmath , jacobson15 ) , as shown by inhomogeneous chemical
evolution models ( argast04 ; wehmeyer15 ) . As summarized in the review
of thielemann17 , one important reason is that the merging of two NS
requires two prior supernova events, that can already lead to a
substantial floor of Fe. This floor may be too high compared to the
CEMP-r stars with the lowest [Fe/H] ratios. This issue may nevertheless
be solved if the two NS have undergone kicks at the time of the
supernova (SN) explosion: in this case, they were removed from the SN
debris and moved into a medium with low Fe pollution. With chemical
evolution models, wehmeyer15 have also shown that if the NS-NS system
takes too long to coalesce, further nucleosynthesis events can occur and
enrich the interstellar medium (ISM) in Fe. When the NS-NS system
finally merges, the surrounding ISM has a higher [Fe/H] than at the
birth of the NS-NS system. In particular, they show that considering NS
merger alone in their models cannot explain the [Eu/Fe] ratios at [Fe/H]
@xmath . Considering also MRSNe as sources of r-elements can provide a
solution to account for the enrichment in Eu at [Fe/H] @xmath (
cescutti14 ; wehmeyer15 ) .

Some other stars have abundance patterns that neither a s-process
pattern, nor a r-process pattern and nor a combination of both can fit
the abundances. In such cases, an intermediate neutron capture process
(i-process, first named by cowan77 ) , operating at neutron densities in
between the s- and r-process may be the solution (e.g. lugaro12 ;
roederer16 ; hampel16 ) . The astrophysical sites for the i-process are
unknown. Such a process may operate in AGB or super-AGB stars ( herwig11
; jones16b ) , in accreting white dwarfs in close binary systems (
denissenkov17 ) or in the He burning shell of Pop III massive stars (
clarkson18 ) . The s-process boost induced by rotation in the massive
stars models of the present work (cf. Chapter 5 ) does not meet the
required conditions (especially neutron density) for the i-process to
occur.

Finally, some other stars seems to show an r+s pattern ( jonsell06 ;
gull18 ) . gull18 reported the discovery of a CEMP star with [Fe/H]
@xmath whose best fit is achieved by a combination of s- and r-process
pattern. In this case, the CEMP star would have formed from at least two
sources, one experiencing the s-process, the other experiencing the
r-process.

#### 2.5.3 CEMP-no stars

At the present day, no CEMP-s, -r, -r/s stars were found below [Fe/H]
@xmath . Below this threshold, all the CEMP stars are either CEMP-no or
just CEMP in case no Ba (and Eu) abundance is available to classify
them. For convenience, I use the term CEMP-no also for the most
iron-poor stars whose rigorous classification is just CEMP.

While interesting in the case of CEMP-s stars, the AGB binary scenario
applied to CEMP-no stars ( suda04 ; suda10 ; campbell10 ) faces
difficulties to account for the observables. One reason is that most
CEMP-no stars appear to be single stars ( hansen16b ) . The
self-enrichment scenario ( fujimoto00 ) seems unlikely, especially to
explain the unevolved stars (cf. Sect. 2.4 ). venn08 proposed that the
high C and low Fe may be explained by the separation of gas and dust
beyond the CEMP star surface, followed by the accretion of dust-depleted
gas. In this case, a dusty disk should exist around CEMP stars, whose
presence would be betrayed by a mid infrared excess. Later, venn14 have
shown that no mid infrared excess was found for six out of the seven
stars they examined (the exception is for HE 0107-5240, that shows a
small excess). Also, this dust-gas separation process should affect in a
similar way the different isotopes of a given element. The carbon
isotopic ratio for instance, will not be modified by this process. The
very low @xmath C/ @xmath C ratios on some CEMP-no stars need to be
explained by another process.

In the end, this let us with the interesting possibility that CEMP-no
stars are the rather direct daughters of a previous generation of stars.
These previous stars should be massive since at the very low metallicity
considered here, low or intermediate mass stars may not had time to
contribute to the chemical enrichment yet. Also, these previous massive
stars should have contributed little in iron.

The fact that the CEMP-no class of star shows very large abundances
scatter suggests that they formed with the ejecta of only one or a few
previous stars. If they were formed from a well mixed reservoir of many
previous stars, the scatter should be much smaller, as is it observed at
higher metallicities or in normal metal-poor stars. Over the past @xmath
years, multiple scenarios, aiming at characterizing the nature of the
CEMP-no source stars, emerged:

-   Mixing and fallback + faint SN ( umeda02 ; umeda03 ; umeda05 ;
    iwamoto05 ; tominaga07b ; heger10 ; tominaga14 ; ishigaki14 ) .

-   Very low metallicity stars experiencing fast rotation (spinstars,
    meynet05iau ; meynet06 ; meynet10 ; hirschi10 ; maeder15a ;
    maeder15b ; choplin16 ; choplin17a ) .

-   Normal SN from 15 @xmath + faint SN with strong fallback from 35
    @xmath ( limongi03 ) .

-   Jet-induced SN from @xmath @xmath Pop III stars ( maeda03 ;
    tominaga09 ) .

-   Rotation + faint SN (no fallback, takahashi14 ) .

-   @xmath @xmath rotating Pop III stars with mixing and fallback (
    joggerst10 ) .

-   H-ingestion event in the He burning shell of a 45 @xmath Pop III
    star ( clarkson18 ) .

This is a tentative list. Some scenario of the list above may be grouped
together. Also, for a given scenario, some works occasionally consider
slightly different methods or physical ingredients, so that they may be
considered as separated scenarios.

Some works suggest that more than one class of source star is required
to explain the CEMP-no stars. For instance, the A(C) @xmath [Fe/H]
diagram (where A(C) = @xmath + 12) suggests that the [Fe/H] @xmath stars
separate in at least two groups ( yoon16 ) , so that at least two
different classes of progenitor might be needed. Also, comparisons of
the chemical composition of CEMP-no stars with ejecta of massive source
stars often show that only one class of progenitor faces difficulty to
reproduce large sample of CEMP-no stars. placco16 have used the yields
of non-rotating Pop III stars of heger10 and shown that 5 out of the 12
investigated CEMP-no stars can be reproduced by the predicted source
star yields while 7 stars are let without an acceptable source star.

The scenarios listed above all consider that (1) the surface abundances
of CEMP-no stars reflect rather directly the abundances in their natal
clouds and (2) the natal cloud was polluted by one or very few zero or
very low metallicity massive source star (schematic view in Fig. 2.7 ).
Each scenario has nevertheless its own specificity. Among the quoted
works in the list above, frequent ingredients considered in source star
models are rotation, extra mixing events (in the sense of umeda02 , see
details below) and strong fallback. Occasionally, both are considered.
Occasionally, refinements or additional ingredients were proposed. Below
are discussed two scenarios in more detail: mixing & fallback and fast
rotating massive stars.

##### Mixing and fallback

###### Mixing.

The [Zn/Fe] ratio of normal metal-poor stars was found to rise with
decreasing [Fe/H] ( cayrel04 , their figure 12) . Models of massive
stars including explosive nucleosynthesis show that at the end of the
evolution, Zn is located in deeper regions than Fe (Fig. 2.8 ).
Consequently, if some Zn is ejected from the massive star (through a
supernova event), also a large amount of Fe is ejected and the trend of
[Zn/Fe] observed at low [Fe/H] cannot be explained. In order to expel
some Zn without expelling too much Fe, umeda02 have included an extra
mixing event in the source star models. The mixing event occurs at the
time of the massive star explosion and brings material from inner layers
closer to the surface. This allows to bring some Zn upward, without
having too much Fe. When considering such a mixing, the supernova yields
can reproduce the observed [Zn/Fe] ratios at low [Fe/H].

###### Fallback.

For stars having a large [C/Fe] and low [Fe/H] (CEMP stars), the concept
of faint supernova with strong fallback was also introduced ( nomoto03 ;
umeda03 ) . The idea of a strong fallback comes from the fact that in
the massive source star, carbon is located closer to the surface than
iron. Therefore, in order to have a large [C/Fe] ratio in the ejecta,
not too deep layers should be expelled so as to eject mostly carbon and
little iron. The supernova is faint because very little @xmath Ni (whose
decay into @xmath Fe is mainly responsible for the luminosity of the
supernova) is ejected. If too much @xmath Ni is ejected, one will
ultimately get too much @xmath Fe compared to the low [Fe/H] ratios of
the most iron poor stars. The concept of strong fallback and faint
supernova for the source star is somewhat consistent with the fact that
low-metallicity stars are more compact and hence might explode less
easily.

The mixing & fallback scenario is a combination of both events. To fit
the observations with a massive source star experiencing mixing and
fallback, a massive source star model is evolved until the end of its
evolution. Then a region inside the model, between two limiting shells
(the two green dashed circles in Fig. 2.9 ), is considered to be fully
mixed at the time of the supernova explosion. A part of the mixed region
is ejected (red part in Fig. 2.9 ), a part is kept into the remnant
(blue part). The extension of the mixed region and the fraction of this
region which is expelled are chosen so as to reproduce the abundances of
observed metal-poor stars.

Although the source star models with mixing and fallback are generally
1D models, tominaga09 has shown that for a Pop III stellar model of 40
@xmath , the 1D mixing and fallback model gives similar chemical yields
than a 2D jet-induced explosion with fallback (Fig. 2.10 ). It can be
roughly understood by the fact that the mixed region is ejected
differently in 1D (spherically) and 2D (along the jet axis) but has a
similar chemical composition. Nevertheless, some chemical species are
overproduced in the 2D jet SN model (e.g. Sc, see Fig. 2.10 ). This is
due to the higher energy concentration in the jet-induced explosion,
that leads to a bit different explosive nucleosynthesis. Overall, it
suggests that the spherical mixing and fallback model is rather well
mimicking a 2D jet-induced explosion.

The mixing and fallback scenario for CEMP-no stars has the advantage to
well explain the iron-peak elements like Zn or Fe. One caveat is that it
faces difficulties in reproducing the high N abundance of some
metal-poor stars ( tominaga07b ) except if additional mixing is
considered between the He-convective shell and the H-rich envelope just
before the supernova ( iwamoto05 ; tominaga14 ) .

##### Fast rotating massive stars

In a broad context, the fast rotating massive star scenario or spinstar
¹³ ¹³ 13 The present work focuses on massive stars but, originally, the
term spinstar also designates intermediate mass stars. scenario proposes
that fast rotation at low metallicity is a dominant process that largely
impacts the outputs of massive stars (especially the stellar yields). It
is motivated by several aspects (see also Sect. 1.3 and 3.3 ). One of
the aspect, further discussed in Sect. 3.3.1 , is that the efficiency of
the rotational mixing operating inside the star is expected to increase
with decreasing metallicity. This effect arises naturally, as a result
of the physics of rotation in stars (discussed in Sect. 3.3 ). As a
consequence of this efficient rotational mixing, the yields of some
elements like C, N, O (e.g. meynet02b ) or s-elements (e.g. pignatari08
; frischknecht16 ) are impacted a lot by rotation in low metallicity
massive stellar models. The spinstar scenario tells us that the low-mass
stars that formed early in the Universe should contain mostly (but
possibly among others) the nucleosynthetic signatures of previous fast
rotating massive stars.

Thanks to Galactic chemical evolution models, it was shown that the N/O,
C/O, @xmath C/ @xmath C and Sr/Ba ratios of very metal-poor (mostly
normal, i.e. not carbon-enhanced) halo stars are better reproduced if
including the yields of fast rotating massive stars ( chiappini06 ;
chiappini08 ; cescutti13 ) . The spinstar scenario has also been
proposed to explain the abundance anomalies (particularly the Mg-Al
anticorrelation) in Globular Clusters ( decressin07 ) .

When applied to CEMP stars, the spinstar scenario proposes that most
CEMP stars have formed from the material ejected through winds and/or
supernova by a previous fast rotating massive source star. meynet06 have
shown that the [C/Fe], [N/Fe] and [O/Fe] ratios in the ejecta (wind +
supernova) of a very low-metallicity fast rotating 60 @xmath are similar
to the surface ratios of the unevolved CEMP stars G77-61 and
HE 1327-2326 (with [Fe/H] @xmath ). In the same line, hirschi07 has
shown that the CNO abundances of HE 1327-2326 can be explained by the
wind of a low metallicity fast rotating 40 @xmath model, whose ejecta
was diluted 600 times with ISM (i.e. 600 times more ISM material than
stellar ejecta). meynet10 have predicted that CEMP stars formed from a
fast rotating massive source star should be helium rich, provided the
ejecta was little diluted with pristine ISM. maeder15a and maeder15b
proposed that the back-and-forth, partial mixing at work between the He-
and H-regions of the rotating source star may account for the wide
variety of CEMP-no stars abundances (more details in Sect. 4.1 ).

It is important to make the difference between the two different kinds
of mixing at work in the spinstar and mixing & fallback scenarios:

-   Spinstar: the mixing is induced by rotation and occurs progressively
    during the evolution of the star.

-   Mixing & fallback: the mixing arises only at the time of the
    supernova.

Contrary to the mixing & fallback process, the process of rotation,
which is at the heart of the spinstar scenario, was not introduced in
stellar models so as to explain the abundances of MP or CEMP stars. As
mentioned, spinstars are expected to exist at very low metallicity, as a
result of the physics of rotation (more details in Sect. 3.3 ). One
strength of the spinstar scenario is that it provides a natural physical
process to explain the abundances of most elements in CEMP stars.
Another strength is that spinstars can account for other observables
like the abundances of normal halo stars (cf. previous discussion).
Rotation may also be a key process to explain the variation of surface
abundances observed in solar metallicity, nearby massive stars (e.g.
martins15 ) . Rotation is linked to different observables, one of which
could be CEMP stars.

The spinstar scenario alone does not offer a solution to explain the
little enrichment in iron-peak elements of CEMP stars (e.g. Fe, Zn). For
instance, in the material ejected by the stellar winds of a rotating
Pop III star, no iron is ejected so that [Fe/H] @xmath . Iron, zinc, …
can be explained by the mixing process in the sense of umeda02 or they
can come from another source. Overall, the spinstar scenario proposes
that rotation in massive stars played a major role in the chemical
enrichment of the early Universe. It does not exclude other ingredients
like mixing & fallback. As noted in maeder15a , spinstar and mixing &
fallback scenarios are more complementary than contradictory: one can
imagine a rotating star experiencing an additional mixing event at the
end of its evolution.

### 2.6 Summary

Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars are peculiar MP stars observed
in the halo of the Galaxy and showing overabundances in light and
sometimes heavy s- and/or r- elements. CEMP stars are more frequent at
low [Fe/H]: about 80 % of stars with [Fe/H] @xmath are CEMP. The most
iron-poor stars are generally weakly enriched in s- and/or s-elements
(CEMP-no). They can be used to constrain the very early chemical
evolution of the Universe.

Evolved CEMP stars probably underwent internal mixing processes
(especially the first dredge-up and thermohaline mixing), altering their
surface abundances. Although important, these processes are likely not
able to explain the peculiar abundances of this class of stars
(especially the unevolved stars). The abundances of CEMP-s stars may be
explained by an accretion episode from the material (enriched in carbon
and s-elements) ejected from an AGB companion. The fact that many CEMP-s
stars are in a binary system supports this scenario. CEMP-no stars are
generally single stars so that another scenario should be invoked.
CEMP-no stars (and generally the most iron-poor stars) are thought to
have kept the nucleosynthetic imprint of only one or very few previous
massive source stars. In some cases however, this imprint may have been
blurred by internal mixing processes in the CEMP-no star itself.
Rotation, pre supernova mixing and strong fallback are among the
interesting characteristics the source stars should have to account for
the abundances of observed CEMP-no stars.

## Chapter 3 Massive source stars: nucleosynthesis and models with
rotation

This chapter first discusses the nucleosynthesis in massive stars. A
section is dedicated to the s-process in AGB stars for completeness. The
theoretical and modeling aspects of massive stellar evolution that are
relevant for this work are then presented. Emphasis is placed on the
specificities of stellar evolution at low metallicity.

### 3.1 Nucleosynthesis processes in massive stars

#### 3.1.1 Stellar fusion

###### Core hydrogen burning.

The first burning stage, lasting for @xmath Myr to several tens of Myr,
is the fusion of hydrogen to helium. The pp-chains and the CNO-cycle
both contribute to transform H into He. Above 17 MK (corresponding the
H-burning temperatures of a @xmath @xmath star), the CNO cycle becomes
more efficient than the pp-chain. Provided a little bit of CNO elements
are available, this is the CNO-cycle that dominates the production of
energy during the H-burning stage of massive stars. The main CNO loop
(CNOI) is shown by the colored loop in Fig. 3.1 . One loop transforms
four protons into one @xmath He. As shown by the colors of the arrows,
@xmath N( @xmath ) is the slowest reaction, followed by @xmath C( @xmath
) and @xmath C( @xmath ). After a timescale determined by @xmath N(
@xmath ) (the slowest reaction) the CNOI cycle reaches an equilibrium
where @xmath C/ @xmath N @xmath and @xmath C/ @xmath C @xmath @xmath .
Because @xmath N( @xmath ) is the bottleneck reaction, the main effect
of CNOI is to transform the initial C nuclei into @xmath N. The
branching point at @xmath N is the starting point of other CNO loops
that take place at higher temperatures and that allow the synthesis of
other isotopes, particularly @xmath O.

During this first stage, the Ne-Na and Mg-Al chains (Fig. 3.2 ) can also
be activated for temperatures higher than @xmath MK for Ne-Na and @xmath
MK for Mg-Al. The rates of the reactions at work in these chains are
more uncertain than the reactions rates of the CNO-cycle. At the
branching point @xmath Na, the @xmath Na( @xmath )/ @xmath Na( @xmath )
ratio equals 159 and 7 at 40 and 70 MK respectively according to
iliadis10b . For the rates of cyburt10 , these ratios are 0.3 and 0.6
(still at 40 and 70 MK). We see that depending on the literature source
used and of the temperature, the Ne-Na and Mg-Al chains can either be
considered as closed loops or not. They are closed loops if the @xmath
Na( @xmath )/ @xmath Na( @xmath ) ratio is high.

Generally, the production of Ne, Na, Mg and Al in massive stars can be
significantly affected if considering nuclear reaction rates from
different sources. decressin07 have shown that multiplying the rate of
@xmath Mg( @xmath ) by @xmath around 50 MK changes the production of
Mg-Al isotopes during the main sequence of low metallicity massive stars
by @xmath dex.

###### Core helium burning.

When running out of hydrogen, the core contracts until the central
temperature is hot enough (about 100 MK) for the @xmath process to
start. The second burning stage is the core helium burning phase. It
lasts for @xmath Myr, which is about 1/10 of the core hydrogen burning
phase. At the beginning of core He-burning, the @xmath N synthesized
during core H-burning through the CNO cycle (cf. previous discussion) is
quickly transformed into @xmath Ne via the chain @xmath N( @xmath )
@xmath F( @xmath ) @xmath O( @xmath ) @xmath Ne. The @xmath Ne( @xmath )
@xmath Mg reaction, activated at @xmath MK releases free neutrons that
can be captured by seeds like iron and heavier elements. This is the
slow neutron capture process (s-process) which is discussed below in
Sect. 3.1.2 .

During core He-burning, a hydrogen shell burns above the helium core.
The H-shell burns at a slightly higher temperature than the H-core. It
induces a somewhat different nucleosynthesis in the H-shell. For
instance, the Ne-Na and Mg-Al cycles are more active in the H-shell.
Rotational mixing can transport elements from the He-burning core to the
H-burning shell (and vice-versa) and trigger a rich and varied
nucleosynthesis (Sect. 4.1 ).

###### Advanced burning stages.

At the end of the core He-burning stage, the most abundant species in
the core are @xmath C and @xmath O. Since the @xmath C + @xmath C
reaction has the lowest coulomb barrier, the next burning stage is core
carbon burning. After carbon burning comes neon photodisintegration,
oxygen and then silicon burning. The advanced stages last for @xmath yr
(C), @xmath yr (Ne), @xmath yr (O) and @xmath days (Si, e.g. heger00 ;
hirschi04 ) . During these stages, most of the energy goes out from the
star in the form of neutrinos. To compensate for this strong energy
loss, the rates of nuclear reactions increase. This leads to a quick
burning of chemical species, explaining the short duration of the
advanced stages. During these stages, the core is decoupled from the
rest of the star. It implies that the star does not move anymore in the
Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. The main products of C-burning are
@xmath Ne, @xmath Na and @xmath Mg. Neon photodisintegration produces
mainly @xmath O, @xmath Mg and @xmath Si, oxygen burning mostly @xmath
Si and @xmath S and silicon burning @xmath Ni (cf. woosley95 ,
especially their Table 19) . At the end of each core burning phase, the
burning continues in a shell. As evolution proceeds, more and more
different burning regions are present in the massive star.

#### 3.1.2 The weak s-process

Massive stars are generally associated to the weak s-process, mainly
responsible for the elements with @xmath . cameron60 identified that at
the beginning of the core He-burning phase of massive stars, the
secondary ¹ ¹ 1 An isotope is synthesized through the secondary channel
if it comes from the initial metal content of the star. It is formed
through the primary channel if produced from the initial hydrogen and
helium content of the star. @xmath N (synthesized during the main
sequence thanks to the CNO-cycle) is converted into @xmath Ne by
successive @xmath captures and can provide a source of neutrons with the
@xmath Ne( @xmath ) reaction. This reaction is efficiently activated at
@xmath MK. It was later recognized that the s-process in massive stars
occurs principally in the He-burning core of massive stars ( peters68 ;
couch74 ; lamb77 ; langer89 ; prantzos90 ; raiteri91a ) . In solar
metallicity stars with @xmath @xmath , some @xmath Ne is left at the end
of core He-burning phase so that s-process can occur during later stages
( couch74 ) . The carbon shell burning is the second efficient s-process
production site inside massive stars (it contributes to @xmath % at
solar metallicity, raiteri91b ; the07 ) . Neutrons are released by
@xmath Ne( @xmath ) with the @xmath particles provided by the @xmath C(
@xmath C, @xmath ) @xmath Ne reaction. The neutron density is typically
@xmath cm @xmath , which is @xmath dex higher than in the He-burning
core. He-burning shell and C-burning core do not contribute
significantly in producing s-elements ( arcoragi91 ) . At low
metallicity, the @xmath C( @xmath ) @xmath O reaction provides a small
burst of neutrons at the very beginning of the core He-burning phase
that can synthesize some light s-elements ( @xmath , baraffe92 ) .

The synthesis of s-elements (Sr, Ba…) is due to neutron capture on heavy
seeds (e.g. Fe). However, neutrons are also captured by light elements.
@xmath C and @xmath O are abundant in the He-core and are important
poisons for the s-process. @xmath O captures neutrons via @xmath O(
@xmath ). Then, either the neutron is recycled with @xmath O( @xmath )
or it is definitely lost with @xmath O( @xmath ). The ratio of these two
reaction rates plays an important role on the efficiency of the
s-process. At low metallicity, the poisoning effect of @xmath O is
stronger because the ratio of @xmath O to s-process seeds (e.g. iron) is
higher ( prantzos90 ; rayet00 ) . During the shell carbon burning phase,
important additional neutron poisons ( @xmath Ne and @xmath Mg) limit
the efficiency of the s-process.

meynet06 and hirschi07 have shown that extra @xmath Ne can be
synthesized during the core He-burning phase of massive rotating stars
(the interplay between rotation and nucleosynthesis in low-metallicity
massive stars is discussed in Sect. 4.1 ). Compared to non-rotating
models, rotation gives more neutrons (source) with the same amount of
seed. A higher source over seed ratio shifts the production of
s-elements towards higher atomic masses ( gallino98 ) . pignatari08 have
shown that rotational mixing would allow the production of s-elements up
to @xmath . frischknecht12 ; frischknecht16 started to explore the
s-process in rotating massive stars, by computing models (about 30
models in total) of different masses ( @xmath @xmath ) and metallicities
( @xmath ) while following the complete s-process during the evolution.
The Chapter 5 of this thesis aims at extending this work by computing a
new grid of models and compare the yields to low mass metal-poor stars
enriched in s-elements.

#### 3.1.3 Explosive nucleosynthesis

The chemical composition of the massive star can be further modified by
explosive nucleosynthesis (e.g. thielemann96 ) . It is activated by a
shock wave that heats the material, processes it and finally ejects the
envelope of the star while the central part will form a neutron star or
a black hole. The innermost layers, from the center to the C-shell can
burn explosively. The outer stellar layers are mostly unprocessed by
explosive nucleosynthesis. thielemann90 reported that above the mass
coordinate @xmath @xmath of a 20 @xmath model (corresponding roughly to
the location of the O-burning shell), the material is not significantly
altered by explosive nucleosynthesis. In the region affected by
explosive nucleosynthesis, the abundances of elements lighter than neon
and heavier than zinc are marginally modified. By contrast, the
iron-peak elements are the most affected ( woosley95 ; thielemann96 ;
woosley02 ; chieffi03 ; limongi03 ; nomoto06 ) . The s-elements produced
during the evolution (cf. Sect. 3.1.2 ) are not expected to be strongly
affected by the explosion ( rauscher02 ; tur09 ) . The shock of the
explosion may nevertheless affect the isotopic distribution of heavy
nuclei in the He-shell of the progenitor ( meyer00 ; pignatari13 ) . In
some cases, massive stars may also experience magneto-rotational
supernovae, which is a possible site for the r-process ( winteler12 ) .

In this work, the explosive nucleosynthesis is not calculated.
Pre-supernova models provide nevertheless a good estimation for the many
species that are not much affected by the explosion. Likely,
pre-supernova models also provide a good estimate of the nucleosynthesis
of all elements above the carbon or oxygen burning shell, where
explosive burning may not operate significantly.

### 3.2 The s-process in AGB stars

The present work focuses on massive stars but the s-process in AGB stars
is also discussed for completeness. Thermally pulsing AGB stars are
associated to the main s-process component, responsible for the elements
with @xmath A @xmath . The AGB corresponds to the last stage of the life
of stars having initial masses between about 1 and 8 @xmath (e.g. the
reviews of iben83 ; busso99 ; herwig05 ; karakas14 ) . At this phase,
the star becomes larger and more luminous and strong mass loss episodes
may occur (up to @xmath @xmath yr @xmath ). AGB stars have a degenerate
carbon-oxygen core. The core is surrounded by the helium and hydrogen
shells, separated by the intershell region. Above is a convective
envelope. The energy production is dominated by the H-burning shell. The
He shell stays quiet most of the time. As H is burning in its shell,
helium is synthesized, making the intershell region growing in mass
(Fig. 3.3 ). When a critical value is reached, He-burning is suddenly
ignited and a thermal pulse occurs. The energy produced drives
convection so that the products of He-burning are brought upward, to the
intershell region. The energy produced also expands the outer layers of
the star. It has the effect of moving the H-burning shell outward and
therefore stopping the burning in the H shell. It also makes the inner
boundary of the convective envelope moving inward and eventually
reaching the intershell region. Then, products of internal
nucleosynthesis are brought up to the surface (this episode is called
third dredge-up or TDU, Fig. 3.3 ). The process described above occurs
cyclically ( @xmath yrs between 2 thermal pulses) until the convective
envelope is entirely removed through winds.

During the TDU, protons are mixed down to the intershell region and they
are directly captured by the abundant @xmath C to form @xmath C through
the chain @xmath C( @xmath ) @xmath N( @xmath ) @xmath C. It forms a
@xmath C pocket. During the next thermal pulse, the reaction @xmath C(
@xmath ) @xmath O occurs, providing neutrons and thus triggering the
s-process. If too many protons are mixed in the intershell region,
@xmath N is also significantly formed from @xmath C (thanks to the CNO
cycle) and suppresses the s-process by capturing the neutrons via @xmath
N( @xmath ) @xmath C.

The @xmath Ne( @xmath ) @xmath Mg reaction is not expected to contribute
much in producing the main s-process component in AGB stars. One reason
is that this reaction is activated in AGB stars with initial masses
@xmath @xmath ( truran77 ) while the solar s-only abundances are best
reproduced by @xmath @xmath AGB models (e.g. gallino88 ; hollowell88 ) .
This said, a contribution of @xmath Ne( @xmath ) is nevertheless
expected to occur in low mass AGB stars (e.g. straniero95 ) , and
particularly in the low metallicity regime, for initial masses above
about 2 @xmath ( lugaro12 ) .

With time, more and more sophisticated AGB stellar models with different
initial masses, metallicities, reaction networks, etc… were computed
(e.g. renzini81 ; gallino98 ; herwig04b ; karakas10 ; cristallo11 ;
lugaro12 ; doherty14 ; cristallo15 ) . Several important uncertainties
remain like for instance the formation mechanism of the @xmath C pocket
² ² 2 In AGB models, a partial mixing zone is added artificially in a
post-processing algorithm in order to mix protons with @xmath C into the
intershell region ( lugaro04 ) . It forms the @xmath C-pocket which is
needed to produce the neutrons required for the s-process. which is a
critical ingredient and is not fully understood yet (e.g. lattanzio05 )
, the third dredge-up (more generally the convection) or the mass loss
(cf. Sect. 4 of karakas14 , for an extensive discussion about
uncertainties in AGB models) .

Despite these uncertainties, the detection of CNO and s-elements at the
surface of observed AGB stars provides evidences of the ongoing
nucleosynthesis in such stars (e.g. smith90 ) . The best evidence is
probably the detection of the unstable element Tc at the surface of AGB
stars ( merrill52 ; smith83 ) : the longest-lived Tc isotope ( @xmath
Tc) has a mean life of about 1/10 of the duration of the AGB phase,
meaning that it has to be synthesized by the AGB star itself.

### 3.3 Massive stellar models including rotation

To study the nucleosynthetic processes mentioned in the previous
section, and more generally the evolution of stars, stellar models are
required. Although stars are 3D objects, following their entire life and
structure using multi dimensional codes is computationally too
expensive. At the present day, only specific stages/zones of a star can
be followed using multi dimensional codes (e.g. herwig14 ; cristini17 )
. In stellar evolution models, a star is often considered as a
spherically symmetric object. This greatly simplifies the modeling since
reducing the problem to one dimension. Compared to multi dimensional
codes, 1D codes have the advantage to be able to model the entire life
of stars and to explore a large parameter space. They have the
disadvantadge to use a parametrized physics to describe the multi
dimensional processes (e.g. turbulence).

Interestingly, rotating stars can also be modeled with 1D codes,
following the theory of shellular rotation ( zahn92 ) . The fundamental
assumption of this theory is that in rotating stars, the horizontal
turbulence (on an isobaric surface, i.e. surface of same pressure) is
much stronger than the vertical one. This is motivated by the stable
density stratification in the vertical direction, opposing a strong
force to vertical fluid motions. In this theoretical frame, internal
rotation depends essentially on the distance to the stellar center and
little on latitude. The generalized 1D equations of hydrostatic
equilibrium, mass conservation, energy conservation and energy
transport, describing a star in shellular rotation are ( meynet97 ) :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

with

@xmath and @xmath

and @xmath the mass enclosed by the sphere of radius @xmath , @xmath the
effective gravity (resulting from both gravitational and centrifugal
acceleration), @xmath and @xmath the radiative and adiabatic temperature
gradients, @xmath the average density between two isobars, @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath the rates of nuclear energy production, neutrino losses,
and gravitational energy (energy released/absorbed by
contraction/expansion of the star). The quantities in brackets are
averaged over an isobar according to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the surface of the isobar, defined by @xmath with @xmath
the radius of the equivalent sphere, having the same volume than the
oblate isobar. d @xmath is a small surface element on the isobar.

In this work, the Geneva stellar evolution code genec ( eggenberger08 )
is used. It was mainly developed and used for the computation of massive
stellar models (e.g. maeder87 ; maeder92 ) with a sophisticated
treatment of rotation ( meynet97 ) . The physical and modeling
ingredients relevant for this work are discussed in the following
sections.

#### 3.3.1 Transport induced by rotation

In a differentially rotating star, the equipotentials are differently
spaced as a function of the colatitude @xmath because the star is
distorted by the centrifugal effect. The centrifugal force makes the
equatorial radius larger than the polar radius so that the
equipotentials are closer to each other at the poles and more spaced at
the equator. Consequently, the effective gravity is larger at the poles.
The radiative flux is proportional to the local effective gravity (
zeipel24 ) meaning that there is an excess of flux along the polar axis
and a deficiency close to the equatorial plane. This imbalance triggers
global circulation motions called meridional circulation. Such currents,
which are advective, contribute to the transport of angular momentum and
chemical elements in rotating stars. In differentially rotating stars,
because the stellar layers have different angular velocities, shear
instabilities arise and also contribute (in a diffusive way) to the
transport of angular momentum and chemical elements.

##### Transport of angular momentum

In the radial direction, the transport of angular momentum obeys the
advective-diffusive equation ( chaboyer92 )

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the angular velocity of a shell, @xmath the density,
@xmath the total diffusion coefficient, taking into account the various
instabilities transporting angular momentum (especially convection and
shear turbulence) and @xmath the amplitude of the radial component of
the meridional velocity ( maeder98 ) . A large ³ ³ 3 @xmath can be
positive or negative. Here the absolute value is considered. @xmath
implies an efficient transport of angular momentum in the radial
direction. @xmath scales with @xmath , a term of particular importance
in the expression of @xmath and that can be approximated by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

The second term in brackets is the Gratton-Öpik term. In the outer
layers of stars, the density @xmath is small so that @xmath , hence
@xmath , can become largely negative (see solid line in Fig. 3.4 ). It
contributes to redistribute efficiently the angular momentum and
therefore smooth the @xmath -profile.

Low metallicity stars contain less metals so they are less opaque and
therefore more compact. Consequently, @xmath is larger so that the
Gratton-Öpik term is generally smaller. This reduces @xmath (see Fig.
3.4 ), meaning that the angular momentum is less redistributed inside
the star. It leads to steeper internal @xmath -profiles. This tends to
produce larger @xmath -gradients which lead to stronger shear
instabilities and then to a more efficient shear mixing.

##### Transport of chemical elements

chaboyer92 have shown that for chemical elements, the combination of
meridional circulation and horizontal turbulence can be described by a
pure diffusive process. The associated diffusion coefficient is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath the horizontal (i.e. on an isobaric surface) shear diffusion
coefficient from zahn92 . It is written as @xmath with @xmath and @xmath
. As a consequence, in contrast with the angular momentum transport
equation (Eq. 3.6 ), the equation for the change of abundance of a given
chemical element @xmath in a given shell at coordinate @xmath is a pure
diffusive equation:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

The last term accounts for the changes due to the nuclear reactions (cf.
Sect. 3.3.3 ). In radiative zones, @xmath with @xmath the diffusion
coefficient accounting for the shear instabilities. Several
prescriptions exist in the literature ( maeder97 ; talon97 ; maeder13 )
. The one used in this work is from talon97 . It can be expressed as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the thermal diffusivity, and @xmath with @xmath the
critical Richardson number below which the medium becomes dynamically
unstable and turbulent. Although the canonical value for @xmath is 1/4
some works have shown that turbulence may happen for larger Richardson
number. canuto02 has shown that turbulence may arise for @xmath @xmath
@xmath . bruggen01 have done numerical simulations suggesting that shear
mixing occurs already at @xmath . The physical range of values may be
around @xmath , corresponding to @xmath .

I computed two 15 @xmath models at solar metallicity with @xmath km s
@xmath and with @xmath and 4. At core H depletion, the surface N/H
ratios are enhanced by a factor of 2 ( @xmath ) and 3 ( @xmath )
compared to the initial surface N/H ratio. Such surface enrichments
qualitatively agree with observation of @xmath @xmath rotating stars
(e.g. gies92 ; villamariz05 ; hunter09 ) . In this work, except stated
explicitly, @xmath . The effect of @xmath on the internal mixing of low
metallicity massive stars is investigated in Sect. 4.3.3 .

##### A comparison of 3 different prescriptions for the shear mixing

Although not used in the present work, I have included in genec the
global diffusion coefficient proposed by maeder13 , taking into account
different instabilities together and their possible interaction (see
Appendix A.2 for calculation details).

Fig. 3.5 shows the tracks of 20 @xmath models with @xmath , @xmath and
computed with various @xmath coefficients: from maeder97 , from talon97
and the global coefficient from maeder13 . The new coefficient @xmath
combining the different instabilities leads to a bluer and more luminous
evolution, characteristic of stars experiencing a high degree of mixing.
The surface @xmath He mass fraction at the end of the main sequence is
the highest in the @xmath model (0.56 against 0.25 and 0.31 for the
@xmath and @xmath models, respectively), which is also a signature of an
efficient rotational mixing. An estimation of the mixing efficiency in
the deep stellar interior can be obtained with the amount of central
@xmath Ne after the main sequence (more details in Sect. 4.1 ). @xmath
Ne in the center reaches a much higher mass fraction in the @xmath and
@xmath models. It suggests that, after the main sequence, a more
efficient mixing in the deep interior is at work in these two models
compared to the @xmath model. The efficiency of the s-process in massive
stars is impacted by the amount of @xmath Ne (main neutron source, cf.
Sect. 3.1.2 ). From Fig. 3.5 , we see that the s-process should operate
similarly in the @xmath and @xmath because of the similar @xmath Ne
content. On the opposite, the @xmath model predicts a less efficient
operation of the s-process.

The dashed track in Fig. 3.5 shows the main sequence of the @xmath model
but with @xmath 40 instead of 4. In this case, the track is rather close
to the track of the model with the global diffusion coefficient. A
higher @xmath value for the @xmath model may mimic the more complex
physics contained in the @xmath coefficient. It shows that finally, even
if @xmath was proposed as a possible upper limit for the @xmath of
talon97 , a higher @xmath (i.e. higher mixing efficiency) probably
cannot be excluded.

#### 3.3.2 Convection

In a star, a heat excess with respect to what radiation can transfer
drives turbulent convective motions. It provides an additional and
efficient way of transporting the energy. In this work, the
Schwarzschild criterion is used to determine the stability of a given
stellar layer.

In the interior of the Sun, the turnover timescale @xmath (timescale for
an element of material to complete a loop in a convective cell) can be
estimated using the mixing-length theory. It is about 0.5 yr ( maeder09
) , suggesting that chemical homogeneity is quickly reached in a
convective zone. Since the lifetime of a star is much longer than the
turnover timescale, the convective mixing can be considered as
instantaneous during most of the stellar life. The last stages of
massive stars (after central carbon burning) are however very short
(less than 1 yr, e.g. hirschi04 ) so that the approximation of
instantaneous convective mixing is no more valid. In this case, the
convection is treated as a diffusive process.

During the H- and He-burning phases of the models computed in the
present work, overshoot is considered: the size of the convective core
is extended by @xmath where @xmath is the pressure scale height and
@xmath for initial masses above @xmath @xmath . @xmath was calibrated so
as to reproduce the observed main-sequence width of stars with @xmath
@xmath ( ekstrom12 ) .

#### 3.3.3 Nuclear network

In a stellar evolution code, to follow the abundance changes due to
nuclear reactions, one has to express the nuclear term in Eq. 3.9 (last
term). It is written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are the mass number of
isotopes @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath are the number of particles of isotope @xmath destroyed @xmath or
produced @xmath in a particular reaction, @xmath and @xmath the
screening factors, @xmath and @xmath ’s are factors preventing double
counting. 1-body reactions refer to photo-disintegrations, @xmath
-decays, @xmath -, @xmath - and @xmath captures. @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath are the nuclear reaction rates. These rates are estimated
experimentally (e.g. caughlan88 ) or theoretically (e.g. rauscher00 )
and tabulated over a certain range of temperature.

The set of differential equation 3.11 is called stiff because of the
strong variety of reaction timescales, ranging from fraction of seconds
to Gyr. An explicit method is not possible to solve these equations
because it would require extremely small timesteps in order to follow
the fastest reactions. In the new version of genec , these equations are
solved in a implicit manner by the backward Euler method ⁴ ⁴ 4 Details
can be found in the Sect. 3.5 of Frischknecht, PhD thesis (2012,
https://edoc.unibas.ch/21287/ ). .

In Chapter 4 of this work, I rely on models computed with a small
nuclear network, that follows 31 species in total: @xmath , @xmath H,
@xmath He, @xmath C, @xmath N, @xmath O, @xmath F, @xmath Ne, @xmath Na,
@xmath Mg, @xmath Al, @xmath Si, @xmath S, @xmath Ar, @xmath Ca, @xmath
Ti, @xmath Cr, @xmath Fe and @xmath Ni. It allows to track the reactions
that contribute significantly to generate nuclear energy. This network
is also enough to follow the nucleosynthesis of the main species beyond
Fe until the ultimate stages of evolution. Finally, this network is well
suited for investigating the origin of CEMP-no stars since such stars do
not show strong overabundances in heavy elements. In Chapter 5 instead,
a network of 737 isotopes is considered, from @xmath H to @xmath Po
(Fig. 3.6 ), that allows to follow the full s-process nucleosynthesis.
Some of the reactions linking the isotopes are shown by the blue segment
in Fig. 3.6 . The nucleosynthesis is followed thanks to the BasNet code
(Basel Network, arnett85 ; thielemann85 ) which is coupled to genec ⁵ ⁵
5 Details can be found in the Sect. 3.7 of Frischknecht, PhD thesis
(2012, https://edoc.unibas.ch/21287/ ). . It allows to follow
consistently all the nucleosynthesis during the entire evolution.

#### 3.3.4 Initial composition and opacity tables

In this work, the initial composition of the low metallicity massive
source stars is taken @xmath -enhanced. Details are given below. In
genec , the initial abundances are in mass fraction. The solar mass
fraction @xmath of an isotope @xmath , associated to an element @xmath
can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the solar abundance of element @xmath taken from
asplund05 , except for Ne, which is from cunha06 . @xmath is the
isotopic fraction in the solar system ( lodders03 ) . @xmath is the mass
number of isotope @xmath and @xmath is the solar hydrogen mass fraction,
at the present day and corresponding to the Asplund+Cunha mixture. As a
remark, since the Sun is 4.57 Gyr old, it has likely experienced atomic
diffusion since its birth. Atomic diffusion progressively decreases the
surface helium and increases the surface hydrogen. Then, the initial
solar abundances are different than the present-day abundances.
ekstrom12 have calibrated a 1 @xmath model including atomic diffusion to
reproduce the solar radius, luminosity and surface chemical composition
at the age of the Sun. It gives an initial hydrogen and helium mass
fraction of 0.720 and 0.266 respectively. The associated initial solar
metallicity is @xmath .

In case the initial metallicity @xmath of the model is not solar, @xmath
is calculated according to the relation @xmath where @xmath is the
primordial helium abundance and @xmath the average slope of the
helium-to-metal enrichment law. I set @xmath ( cyburt03 ) . Once the
helium mass fraction is calculated, the initial hydrogen mass fraction
is deduced from @xmath .

When @xmath is not solar, if the mixture of metal remains solar-like,
the mass fractions of metals are just multiplied by @xmath i.e. @xmath
with @xmath from Eq. 3.12 . This leads to a solar-scaled mixture,
meaning that [X/Fe] @xmath . However, at [Fe/H] @xmath , it appears that
[ @xmath /Fe] @xmath where @xmath represent the @xmath -elements (e.g.
reddy06 ) . In genec , for @xmath [Fe/H] @xmath , [ @xmath /Fe] @xmath
[Fe/H] with @xmath = 0.562, 0.886, 0.500, 0.411, 0.307, 0.435, 0.300,
0.222 and 0.251 for the @xmath -elements @xmath C, @xmath O, @xmath Ne,
@xmath Mg, @xmath Si, @xmath S, @xmath Ar, @xmath Ca and @xmath Ti
respectively. These numbers were derived by fitting the abundance trends
[ @xmath /Fe] versus [Fe/H] from halo and thick disc F- and G-dwarfs
stars with @xmath [Fe/H] @xmath ( reddy06 ) . At [Fe/H] @xmath , [
@xmath /Fe] @xmath is set (i.e. no dependance on metallicity). The mass
fractions of the @xmath -isotopes are calculated according to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the sum of the mass fractions of all Fe isotopes. The
mass fraction of the non @xmath -isotopes are calculated with the same
equation but with @xmath . Accordingly to this @xmath -enhanced mixture,
the opacity tables were computed with the OPAL tool ⁶ ⁶ 6
http://opalopacity.llnl.gov . . They are complemented at low
temperatures by the opacities from ferguson05 .

In general, at low metallicity, the initial mixture is poorly known and
other initial mixtures cannot be excluded. An @xmath -enhanced mixture
may be the most natural choice. However, it is worth noting that for
most of the elements and low-metallicity models considered in this work,
the abundances in the ejecta of the massive star models are very
different from the initial ones. It implies that the dependance of the
chemical yields on the initial composition is weak.

Also worth to mention is that with Galactic chemical evolution models,
chiappini08 have shown that if massive fast rotators were common in the
early Universe, @xmath C/ @xmath C would be between about 30 and 300 in
the (almost) primordial ISM. Without fast rotators, @xmath C/ @xmath C
would be between about 4500 and 31000. Here I take @xmath C/ @xmath C
@xmath . Lower or higher values cannot be excluded. This is discussed in
the next chapters.

#### 3.3.5 Mass loss

AGB and massive stars show spectroscopic evidences of stellar winds (
kudritzki00 , for a review) . Stellar winds are mainly driven by the
absorption of UV-photons by metal lines. Winds are consequently stronger
in hot metal-rich stars. The radiation pressure expels stellar material.
It can make a 120 @xmath solar metallicity star losing more than 70 % of
its initial mass ( ekstrom12 ) . At low metallicity, radiative winds are
weaker because of the smaller content in metals. Radiative mass loss
rates follow a scaling relation with metallicity @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the solar metallicity mass loss rate and @xmath ( vink01
) . In this work, radiative mass-loss rates are from vink01 when @xmath
and from jager88 when @xmath . For the models of Sect. 4.5.2 however,
the prescription of kudritzki00 is used instead of vink01 . Radiative
winds at low metallicity are generally small so that no big impact is
expected. Also, for @xmath , jager88 is used in any case.

The stellar surface can also reach the Eddington luminosity @xmath
(luminosity when the radiative force balances the gravitational force)
which triggers additional mass loss. In genec , the mass-loss rate is
increased by a factor of 3 when the luminosity of any layer in the
stellar envelope becomes higher than five times the Eddington luminosity
( ekstrom12 ) .

Another recent mass loss mechanism was proposed for metal-free stars
with @xmath @xmath ( moriya15 ) : if @xmath the envelope of such stars
may become pulsationally unstable near the end of their evolution and
undergo extreme mass-loss events, of the order of @xmath @xmath yr
@xmath . Although not used in the models of this work, I have added this
prescription in genec (details in Appendix A.3 ).

##### Effect of rotation on mass loss

Rotation is expected to affect the mass loss of stars. First, it makes
the stellar winds anisotropic by favoring an ejection of matter through
both the poles and the equator ( maeder99b ) . The reason is that the
polar regions are hotter than the equatorial regions (cf. Sect. 3.3.1 )
so that the radiation pressure, hence the mass loss rate is stronger at
the poles. Also, for stars with equatorial temperatures @xmath K
(rotation tends to reduce the temperature at the equator), the high
opacity around the equator triggers enhanced radiative winds that push
the matter outward and produce an equatorial ring.

When the stellar surface reaches the critical velocity, the outer layers
are no longer bound and some mass is removed mechanically. In rotating
stars having an Eddington factor @xmath , because of the interplay
between radiation and rotation, the critical velocity is reduced (
maeder00 ) . The consequence is that mechanical mass loss occurs more
easily (i.e. at a smaller rotation rate). Mechanical mass losses on the
rotating massive Pop III models of ekstrom08phd removes @xmath % of the
total stellar mass.

More generally, if considering 2 stars of same mass @xmath , one
rotating at @xmath and one non-rotating, at about the same location in
the HR diagram, the mass loss ratio @xmath / @xmath is greater than one
and depends, among other, on @xmath and @xmath ( maeder00 ) . Models
including rotation are corrected by this factor, that becomes very high
for large @xmath factors.

Also, by changing the distribution of the chemical species in the
stellar interior, rotation modifies the tracks in the HR diagram. Since
radiative mass loss rates depend on @xmath and @xmath , the mass loss
experienced by the star is changed. For instance, rotation tends to
produce bigger cores, increasing the luminosity @xmath of the star hence
increasing the mass loss rate @xmath , that varies as @xmath ( vink01 )
.

Fast rotation may also induce extreme radiative winds during the core
He-burning stage of very low massive metallicity stars. It occurs if a
large amount of metals from the stellar interior is brought up to the
surface. In this case, the surface metallicity increases dramatically so
that strong radiative winds are triggered (Eq. 3.14 ). It can make a
very low metallicity ( @xmath ) massive star to lose about 70 % of its
mass ( hirschi07 ) . Such strong mass loss episodes are however not
happening in all low/zero metallicity rotating models ( hirschi07 ;
ekstrom08 ) and are sensitive to different parameters (see Sect. 4.8 for
additional discussions).

#### 3.3.6 Chemical composition of the ejecta

For a stellar model, the ejected mass @xmath in @xmath under the form of
an isotope @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the bounds @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath are the total lifetime,
mass at the end of the evolution and mass cut ⁷ ⁷ 7 At the end of the
evolution, the mass cut is the mass coordinate that delimitates the part
of the star which is expelled from the part which is kept into the
remnant. of the model, respectively. @xmath and @xmath are the surface
mass fraction and the mass loss rate at time @xmath respectively. @xmath
is the mass fraction of the isotope @xmath at coordinate @xmath , at the
end of the evolution. From Eq. 3.15 and knowing the solar composition,
the [X/Y] ratios in the ejected material can be computed ⁸ ⁸ 8 In the
bracket notation, X and Y are in number so that the mass ejected @xmath
of an isotope @xmath has to be divided by its atomic mass @xmath . For
instance, [C/H] @xmath . .

The stellar yield of an isotope @xmath is expressed as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath the initial mass fraction of isotope @xmath . The only
difference with Eq. 3.15 is that the mass under the form of the isotope
@xmath that was initially present in the star is deduced. Hence, @xmath
can be either positive or negative.

Finally, for an isotope @xmath , the production factor @xmath is defined
as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath the total mass ejected by the star, @xmath the initial mass
and @xmath the mass fraction of isotope @xmath in the ejecta. It
expresses, for a given isotope, the ratio of what is given back by the
star divided by what was present initially in the whole star.

### 3.4 Axions and their impact on Pop III stars

This section presents a side project of the thesis, related to the
evolution of metal-free massive stars including axion cooling. Axions
are hypothetical elementary particles that are of interest as possible
components of cold dark matter ( preskill83 ; abbott83 ; dine83 ) . They
interact weakly with matter. In stars, they can be considered as an
energy sink, taking away the energy, like neutrinos. An axion loss rate
as a function of the stellar temperature and density can be derived and
introduced in stellar evolution codes in order to see how such losses
affect the life of stars. friedland13 found that axion losses can
shorten and eliminate the blue loop phase of solar metallicity @xmath
@xmath stars.

In collaboration with Alain Coc (Centre de Sciences Nucléaires et de
Sciences de la Matière (CSNSM), France), Keith A. Olive (William I. Fine
Theoretical Physics Institute, School of Physics and Astronomy,
University of Minnesota, USA), Jean-Philippe Uzan and Elisabeth Vangioni
(Institut d’Astrophysique de Paris (IAP), France), I have studied the
effects of axions on Pop III stars in the article (the full paper can be
found page C of this thesis):

Effects of axions on Population III stars
A. Choplin, A. Coc, G. Meynet, K. A. Olive, J.-P. Uzan & E. Vangioni,
2017 A&A 605 , 106

First, I introduced the axion losses @xmath in genec . The derivatives
of @xmath as a function of the pressure @xmath and temperature @xmath
were also introduced in genec so as to help for convergence when solving
the structure equations (see Appendix A.1 for more details and
calculations). Then, I computed a grid of non-rotating Pop III massive
stars with initial masses of 20, 25, 32, 40, 60, 85, 120 and 150 @xmath
, with and without axion losses, until the end of the core C-burning
phase.

During the main sequence, the energy is mainly transported by radiation
and convection. Axion losses have a modest effect: the main sequence
lifetime is shorten by less than 3 % in models including axions.
Although still modest, axion losses are stronger during the core
He-burning stage, because of higher temperature. Consequently, the core
He-burning lifetime is reduced by @xmath %. The phase from core He
depletion to core C-burning ignition lasts for @xmath yr. During this
phase, the carbon-oxygen core contracts so that the central temperature
increases and axion losses become important. Neutrino losses are not
strong yet. This is during this short axion-dominated phase that axions
are likely inducing the most significant changes in the evolution. From
core C-burning ignition to the end of the evolution, axion losses become
negligible compared to neutrino losses so that stellar evolution is no
more altered.

We found that globally, the effects of axions on stellar evolution are
very modest and will be very hardly observable. The strongest effect of
axions arises in the 85 and 120 @xmath models. Differences in central
temperature, density and chemical composition appear after core He
depletion, for a short period of time, as a transitory reaction of the
model to the increased loss of energy in the central regions (cf.
previous discussion). Such differences might prevent the 85 and 120
@xmath models with axion losses to experience a pulsational
pair-instability supernova (PPISN), as it may be expected for stars with
initial masses between 70 and 140 @xmath ( woosley17 ) . If so, such
stars with axions could produce black holes in a mass range where
standard stellar models do not predict them. It might induce a potential
signature in gravitational waves. As discussed in the paper, however,
the uncertainties of different stellar model parameters produce effects
at least as strong as axions on the structure of the star, particularly
during the late evolution stages. We are therefore still far from a
situation where Pop III stellar models can be used as a physics
laboratory to verify the presence of axions or constrain their
properties.

### 3.5 Summary

A quick summary of nucleosynthesis, modeling and theoretical aspects
important for what follows is given. In the H-burning region of massive
stars, the operation of the CNO cycle, Ne-Na and Mg-Al-Si chains can
synthesize elements from C to Si. The @xmath N transformed in @xmath Ne
at the core He-burning ignition will later (when the central temperature
@xmath MK) provides free neutrons. It leads to the principal component
of the weak s-process in massive stars (the other and smaller component
comes from the C-burning shell), able to synthesize elements with A
@xmath 90. Rotation-induced mixing provides additional @xmath Ne, which
can shifts the s-process pattern towards heavier elements. Among others
light elements, @xmath O, which is abundant in the He-burning core, can
poison the s-process by capturing neutrons. The main s-process,
responsible for elements with @xmath A @xmath is associated with
thermally pulsing AGB stars, having initial masses between about 1 and 8
@xmath .

Some important physical ingredients were presented in Sect. 3.3 for the
modeling of massive stars including rotation. At low metallicity, a
natural effect of the physics of rotation in stars is that the
rotation-induced mixing of chemical elements is more efficient. One
reason is due to the less efficient redistribution of the angular
momentum by meridional currents. Rotation enhances the mass loss in
different ways, particularly because of the interplay of radiation and
rotation. The mass loss is generally reduced at low metallicity but
extreme mass loss events can nevertheless happen in fast rotating
massive models (Fig. 3.7 for a schematic view). The nuclear network
considered in this work comprises either 31 isotopes (Chapter 4 ) or
737, from @xmath H to @xmath Po (Chapter 5 ). While the small network is
suitable for the study of CEMP-no stars, the second is required to study
CEMP stars enriched in heavier elements like strontium or barium.

## Chapter 4 Mixing in CEMP-no source stars

In this chapter, the origin of the CEMP stars with [Fe/H] @xmath is
investigated. The recognized CEMP-s, -r/s and -r stars are not
considered. For convenience, the stars considered here are referred to
as CEMP-no stars, even if strictly speaking, some of them are just CEMP
(because of missing abundance data to classify them). Sections 4.2 and
4.5 include the results published in the first and second articles
mentioned below, respectively (the full papers can be found page C and C
of this thesis).

### 4.1 The back-and-forth mixing process

In the previous chapter, some aspects regarding the nucleosynthesis and
the physics of rotation were discussed. The interplay between rotation
and nucleosynthesis in rotating massive stars is now discussed.

During the core H-burning and He-burning phase, the mixing induced by
rotation changes the distribution of the chemical elements inside the
star. In advanced stages (C-burning and after), the burning timescale
becomes small compared to the rotational mixing timescale so that
rotation barely affects the distribution of chemical elements. During
the core He-burning phase, two different burning regions exist in the
star (He-burning core and H-burning shell). The rotational mixing
triggers exchanges of material between the convective He-burning core
and the convective H-burning shell: He-burning products are transported
to the H-burning shell, processed by H-burning, transported back to the
He-burning core, etc… The main steps of this mixing process are (see
Fig. 4.1 for a schematic view):

1.  In the He-burning core, the triple alpha process synthesizes @xmath
    C. @xmath O is formed by @xmath C( @xmath ) @xmath O.

2.  @xmath C and @xmath O are mixed into the H-burning shell. It boosts
    the CNO cycle and creates primary CNO elements, especially @xmath N
    (and @xmath C to a smaller extent).

3.  The products of the H-burning shell (among them primary @xmath C and
    @xmath N) are mixed back into the He-core. From the primary @xmath
    N, the reaction chain @xmath N( @xmath ) @xmath F( @xmath ) @xmath
    O( @xmath ) @xmath Ne allows the synthesis of primary @xmath Ne. The
    reactions @xmath Ne( @xmath ) and @xmath Ne( @xmath ) make @xmath Mg
    and @xmath Mg respectively. The neutrons released by the @xmath Ne(
    @xmath ) reaction produce @xmath F, @xmath Na, @xmath Mg and @xmath
    Al by @xmath N( @xmath ) @xmath N( @xmath ) @xmath F, @xmath Ne(
    @xmath ) @xmath Ne( @xmath ) @xmath Na, @xmath Na( @xmath ) @xmath
    Na( @xmath ) @xmath Mg and @xmath Mg( @xmath ) @xmath Mg( @xmath )
    @xmath Al, respectively. Free neutrons can also be captured by
    heavier seeds like @xmath Fe and boost the s-process (cf. Sect.
    3.1.2 ). This point is investigated in details in Chapter 5 .

4.  The newly formed elements in the He-burning core can be mixed again
    into the H-burning shell. It boosts the Ne-Na and Mg-Al chains:
    additional Na and Al are produced.

A very fast rotator will go through all the steps while a slow rotator
only through the first one. An important effect (not shown in Fig. 4.1 )
is the growth of the convective He-burning core that helps reaching
layers that had been previously enriched in H-burning products (e.g.
@xmath C, @xmath N). Both the growing of the convective He core and the
backward diffusion of chemical elements impact the nucleosynthesis in
the He-burning core of rotating models.

Fig. 4.2 shows the results of this mixing process in a 20 @xmath stellar
model, when the central @xmath He mass fraction is about 0.2. The @xmath
N and @xmath C peaks can be seen and to a smaller extent, the @xmath Na
peak (at @xmath @xmath ). In the He-core, @xmath Ne has been enhanced
because of the ingestion of the extra @xmath N. Complete stellar models
are discussed in more details in Sect. 4.3 .

### 4.2 Nucleosynthesis in a box

maeder15a suggested that the wide range of abundances covered by CEMP-no
stars could come from a material ejected by massive source stars having
experienced various degree of rotational mixing. In this scenario, the
variety of CEMP-no star abundances are mainly explained by the interplay
between rotation and nucleosynthesis at work during the core He-burning
phase of the massive source star (described in Sect. 4.1 ). maeder15b
built a new classification scheme for CEMP-no stars by considering the
successive steps in the back-and-forth mixing process. Five classes were
proposed, the first one showing a complete absence of mixing and the
fifth one a high degree of mixing (see Fig. 4.3 ). For instance,
HE 1327-2326, with [Fe/H] @xmath ( frebel08 ) and showing strong
overabundances in light elements (e.g. CNO) as well as in strontium, is
belonging to class 4. In maeder15b , they considered 46 stars, 4
appeared to be of class 2, 17 of class 3, 9 of class 4 and 16
unclassified because of missing abundance data. No star belonging to
class 0 or 1 were found.

In choplin16 , we aimed at investigating quantitatively the effect of
the back-and-forth mixing process using a one-zone (or box)
nucleosynthesis code I developed. This code allows the injection of
chemical species in the box while nucleosynthesis is calculated. It
mimics the effect of rotational mixing at work in complete rotating
stellar models. In the paper, I used the one-zone code to mimic the
hydrogen burning shell of a massive rotating star in which @xmath C,
@xmath O, @xmath Ne, and @xmath Mg are injected (these species are
supposed to come from the He-burning core of the rotating massive star).
We studied the nucleosynthesis of the CNO cycle and the Ne-Na Mg-Al
chains at different temperatures, densities, and with different nuclear
reaction rates while injecting chemical species.

##### Initial setup

For the initial composition of the box, a rotating 60 @xmath model is
used, with @xmath (corresponding to [Fe/H] @xmath ) and computed with an
@xmath enhanced mixture. The initial abundances in the box are taken
from the H-burning shell of this stellar model, when it starts the core
He-burning stage (central @xmath He mass fraction equals to 0.98). The
corresponding initial [X/Fe] ratios in the box are shown in Fig. 4.4 by
the patterns with squares. The initial composition of the box is
different than the initial composition of the stellar model since some
nuclear burning has already operated in the stellar model during the
H-burning phase. In particular, CNO burning has operated (that mainly
transforms C and O into N) explaining the high initial [N/Fe] and lower
[C/Fe] and [O/Fe] in the box. The nuclear reaction rates of the CNO
cycle are from angulo99 except for @xmath N( @xmath ) @xmath O which is
from mukhamedzhanov03 if @xmath GK and angulo99 otherwise. The rates
related to the Ne-Na and Mg-Al chains are from iliadis01 . Only @xmath
Ne( @xmath ) @xmath Na and @xmath Ne( @xmath ) @xmath Na are taken from
angulo99 and hale02 , respectively. For @xmath @xmath stellar models at
such metallicity, @xmath MK and @xmath g cm @xmath in the H-burning
shell. There are the default temperature and density taken in the box.
The box simulations are stopped either at H-exhaustion ( @xmath H mass
fraction is below @xmath ) or when the time exceeds 10 Myr.

Four separate injection experiments were carried out: (1) no injection,
(2) injection of @xmath C and @xmath O, (3) injection of @xmath C,
@xmath O and @xmath Ne and (4) injection of @xmath C, @xmath O, @xmath
Ne and @xmath Mg. The species are injected at a constant rate. During a
time @xmath , a mass @xmath under the form of the isotope @xmath is
injected in the burning box. @xmath is the injection rate of the isotope
@xmath expressed in @xmath yr @xmath . @xmath was calibrated using
results from complete stellar models. Details on this calibration are
now given (see also the appendix of choplin16 , page C of this thesis) .

##### Injection of chemical species

The rate @xmath at which @xmath C is injected in the box was calibrated
by quantifying @xmath which is the mass of primary @xmath N formed
during the core helium burning phase of a rotating massive star. Primary
@xmath N during the core helium burning phase of rotating stars is
formed because of the arrival of @xmath C and @xmath O from the helium
core (cf. Sect. 4.1 ). @xmath can be expressed as the total amount of
@xmath N in the star at core helium exhaustion minus the amount of
@xmath N that can be formed with the initial CNO content (the secondary
@xmath N):

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the central @xmath He mass fraction, @xmath the mass
fraction of @xmath N at coordinate @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath the
initial mass fractions of the CNO elements in the stellar model, and
@xmath the total mass of the star at the end of the core helium burning
phase. Let us suppose that all the @xmath C and @xmath O diffusing from
the helium core to the hydrogen shell are transformed into @xmath N. In
this case, an average injection rate @xmath of @xmath C + @xmath O can
be defined

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the duration of the core helium burning phase. It gives
the average rate at which @xmath C + @xmath O should be injected in the
H-burning shell so as to obtain @xmath in the model at the end of core
helium burning. For a 60 @xmath model at @xmath and with ¹ ¹ 1 The
critical velocity @xmath is reached when the gravitational acceleration
is counterbalanced by the centrifugal force. It is expressed as @xmath
with @xmath the polar radius at the critical limit. @xmath , @xmath is
equal to @xmath @xmath yr @xmath .

Of course, the amount of primary nitrogen synthesized, hence the value
of @xmath , can change significantly depending on the rotation, the mass
of the stellar model, or the prescription for the rotational mixing for
instance. The @xmath rate estimated above gives an idea of possible
values but other injection rates around this value are possible. Here I
set @xmath @xmath yr @xmath . The two rates are taken equal since there
is roughly as much @xmath C as @xmath O in the helium core so that
roughly as much @xmath C as @xmath O will enter in the H-burning shell.
Finally, @xmath @xmath yr @xmath . The factor 100 between the two rates
accounts for the fact that @xmath Ne and @xmath Mg are about 100 times
less abundant than @xmath C and @xmath O in the helium burning core so
that about 100 times less @xmath Ne and @xmath Mg will enter by
rotational mixing into the H-burning shell. Injection rates divided and
multiplied by 100 were also investigated: @xmath and @xmath @xmath yr
@xmath for @xmath and @xmath and therefore @xmath and @xmath @xmath yr
@xmath for @xmath and @xmath .

##### Results

As shown in Fig. 4.4 , C, N, O and F are boosted by @xmath dex when
injecting @xmath C, @xmath O because of the injection and the effect of
CNO cycle. Injection of @xmath Ne gives Ne, Na and Mg with Na being the
main product. With the nuclear rates considered, the @xmath Na( @xmath )
@xmath Ne reaction is just 1.6 stronger than the @xmath Na( @xmath )
@xmath Mg reaction. It means that @xmath Na goes almost 50 @xmath 50 to
@xmath Ne and @xmath Mg. It allows a significant production of @xmath
Mg. No Al is produced because the @xmath Mg( @xmath ) @xmath Al
reaction, activating the Mg-Al cycle, is too slow at the considered
temperature. Injection of @xmath Mg boosts Mg and Al. The [ @xmath C/
@xmath C] ratio ² ² 2 [ @xmath C/ @xmath C] = @xmath ( @xmath C/ @xmath
C) @xmath @xmath @xmath ( @xmath C/ @xmath C) @xmath . In the Sun, (
@xmath C/ @xmath C @xmath = 89, i.e. @xmath ( @xmath C/ @xmath C) @xmath
= 1.95. stays always around @xmath (equivalent to @xmath C/ @xmath C
@xmath ), which is the CNO-equilibrium value. At @xmath MK, the
timescale for the @xmath C/ @xmath C ratio to reach CNO-equilibrium is
about @xmath yr, i.e. reached almost instantaneously.

This simple one-zone model gives a good estimation of what happens in
complete stellar models: green patterns in Fig. 4.4 are from complete 20
@xmath stellar models with @xmath 30 % and 70 %, at the end of the core
He-burning phase. The abundances are taken in the stellar shell where
the energy released by hydrogen burning is the highest. These patterns
are close enough to the results obtained with the box model.

##### Comparison with CEMP-no stars of classes 2 and 4

From the classification done in maeder15b , the classes 2 and 4 CEMP-no
stars were selected (13 stars). These classes of stars are made of a
material that was processed by H-burning, with various degree of
enrichment (Fig. 4.3 ). I considered only stars having a [Fe/H] ratio
close to the [Fe/H] @xmath of the box. HE 0057-5959 was classified as a
class 2+Na star since it shows the characteristics of a class 2 star,
except for Na, which is overabundant ([Na/Fe] = 1.98).

The best match between models and observations is when @xmath C and
@xmath O are injected for the class 2 and when @xmath C, @xmath O and
@xmath Ne are injected for the class 4. Injecting only @xmath C and
@xmath O does not allow to reproduce the stars of class 4, which are
generally Na- and Mg-rich. Injecting additional @xmath Mg raises the
[Al/Fe] ratio and leads to a larger discrepancy between models and
observations. In any case, the models overestimate the [Al/Fe] ratios.
Below are discussed the uncertainties on the observed and predicted
[Al/Fe] ratios.

###### Uncertainties on the aluminum abundance of CEMP-no stars.

The first point is that the CEMP sample is not homogeneous ³ ³ 3 A
sample is homogeneous if the same procedure is used to obtain all
observations and abundances. . The abundance data considered comes from
several sources. Ideally, an homogeneous sample is needed because a
mixture of abundances from various authors sometimes adds an undesirable
scatter that makes harder the use of the sample to constrain the models.
However very metal-poor stars are very rare and no large homogeneous
sample exists yet. The second point is that in the sample considered,
most of the abundances are derived based on 1D LTE atmosphere models.
For turnoff stars at [Fe/H] @xmath , andrievsky08 derived a correction
@xmath [Al/Fe] @xmath [Al/Fe] @xmath @xmath [Al/Fe] @xmath dex. In
addition to NLTE, 3D effects can add another correction factor.
nordlander17 have shown that the difference between 3D NLTE and 1D LTE
for Al in metal-poor stars can amount @xmath dex. In the stars plotted
in Fig. 4.4 , there is for instance CS 22949-037 with [Al/Fe] @xmath .
This ratio was derived based on 1D LTE model-atmosphere analyses (
norris13 ) . According to the previous discussion, NLTE/3D effects could
rise [Al/Fe] up to @xmath dex. This is still @xmath dex below the values
predicted by the models.

###### Uncertainties on the aluminum abundance predicted by the models.

As mentioned, the initial [Al/Fe] @xmath in the box comes from the
H-burning shell of a complete stellar model at core He-ignition. The
initial [Al/Fe] of this stellar model is 0 (i.e. solar). The
nucleosynthesis during the main sequence and very beginning of core
He-burning has synthesized some Al (especially through the Mg-Al chain),
up to [Al/Fe] @xmath . I have investigated how the Al production is
affected (considering both the stellar model and the box model) when
varying some specific nuclear reaction rates. Several literature sources
provide nuclear reaction rates for the three major reactions involving
@xmath Al in H-burning zones: @xmath Mg( @xmath ) @xmath Al, @xmath Al(
@xmath ) @xmath Si and @xmath Al( @xmath ) @xmath Mg. For instance,
there are six sources for @xmath Al( @xmath ) @xmath Si spanning @xmath
order of magnitude at @xmath MK (according to the JINA reaclib ⁴ ⁴ 4
http://jinaweb.org/reaclib/db/ . ). Using the rates in the literature
that favor the destruction (or smallest production) of @xmath Al leads
to a final [Al/Fe] in the box of about 0, i.e. @xmath dex below the
[Al/Fe] ratio shown in Fig. 4.4 . It would match better the
observations. Finally, because of important uncertainties existing on
some nuclear rates, caution is required when interpreting the
nucleosynthetic predictions of some elements like Al.

###### The @xmathC/@xmathC ratio.

The CEMP-no stars in Fig. 4.4 have low @xmath C/ @xmath C ratios
compared to the Sun: @xmath [ @xmath C/ @xmath C] @xmath , which is
equivalent to @xmath @xmath C/ @xmath C @xmath (in the solar system, the
carbon isotopic ratio is about 90, lodders03 ) . Some CEMP-no stars are
giants and may therefore have experienced mixing events like the first
dredge-up. In this case, the observed @xmath C/ @xmath C may have
changed since the formation of the CEMP-no star. If so, the link between
the CEMP-no star and its source star is more difficult to establish
(further discussions in Sect. 4.4.2 , cf. also Sect. 2.4 ). By contrast,
the surface composition of unevolved CEMP-no stars reflects more
directly the composition of the cloud in which they formed, hence the
composition of the material ejected by the previous source star. Some
CEMP-no stars in the considered sample are still rather unevolved:
CS 22958-042 for instance, has @xmath K, @xmath and @xmath C/ @xmath C
@xmath . Such a @xmath C/ @xmath C ratio is consistent with a material
processed only by H-burning in the previous massive source star. In
He-burning regions of massive stars, @xmath C is destroyed so that
@xmath C/ @xmath C @xmath . Consequently, it is unlikely that this
CEMP-no star formed from a source star material processed by He-burning.
This will be discussed in more details while considering yields from
complete source star models (Sect. 4.3 and 4.4 ).

##### Conclusion

The conclusion from this box experiment is that the range of abundances
of class 2 and 4 CEMP-no stars is overall well reproduced by a material
processed by H-burning at a temperature and density characteristic of
@xmath @xmath source stars. During its burning, the material was
enriched in He-burning products: @xmath C, @xmath O for class 2, @xmath
C, @xmath O and @xmath Ne for class 4. This is consistent with the
scenario of maeder15b proposing that CEMP-no stars are made of a
material ejected from a massive star having experienced various degree
of rotational mixing.

### 4.3 Massive source stars with rotation

As a next step, complete stellar models with various initial rotation
rates are considered. It allows to give more realistic abundance
predictions than with a one-zone model. Other source star parameters
such as mass and metallicity are also investigated.

#### 4.3.1 Physical ingredients

I computed 20 @xmath models at a metallicity @xmath with ⁵ ⁵ 5 The
critical velocity @xmath is reached when the gravitational acceleration
is counterbalanced by the centrifugal force. It is expressed as @xmath
with @xmath the polar radius at the critical limit. @xmath 0, 0.1, 0.2,
0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 0.7. I also computed a 40 and a 60 @xmath model at
@xmath and with @xmath 0.4 to explore different initial masses. Finally,
a 20 @xmath at @xmath and with @xmath 0.4 was computed to evaluate the
effect of metallicity. The nuclear reaction rates are the same than for
the box model. The evolution is stopped at the end of core carbon
burning. The very last burning stages (also explosive nucleosynthesis,
cf. Sect. 3.1.3 ) significantly modify only the abundances of the most
inner layers. The yields of the models presented here provide good
predictions, provided the most inner layers of the star are not ejected
and considered in the yields. More details on the other physical
ingredients (shear mixing, mass loss, initial composition…) can be found
in Sect. 3.3 .

#### 4.3.2 Evolution with rotation

This section discusses the effects of rotation by focusing on the 20
@xmath models with various initial rotation rates.

The effective gravity of the stellar core is decreased by rotation
because of the effect of the centrifugal force. It decreases the
temperature in the convective core and tends to make it smaller. On the
other hand, rotation tends to produce bigger cores because of the
rotational mixing that provides additional fuel to the core. Overall, in
the models presented here, rotation produces bigger cores at the end of
the evolution (Fig. 4.5 ). For instance the size of the carbon-oxygen
core (CO-core, defined where the @xmath He mass fraction drops below
@xmath ) increases by about 1.5 @xmath from the non rotating model to
the fast rotating one. A consequence is that the base of the H-rich
envelope and the He-rich region are shifted towards higher mass
coordinates when initial rotation increases (Fig. 4.6 , top panels).

As the initial rotation increases, the He-burning products (e.g. @xmath
C, @xmath O, @xmath Ne) transit quicker and in greater amount to the
H-burning shell so that more @xmath C, @xmath N, @xmath F, @xmath Na are
synthesized (Fig. 4.6 and 4.7 ). Around the mass coordinate 7 @xmath ,
@xmath C and @xmath N are boosted by @xmath dex from @xmath to 0.7.
Rotation increases the production of @xmath F, @xmath Ne, @xmath Na,
@xmath Mg and @xmath Al in the He-burning core (cf. Sect. 4.1 ). Near
the end of the core He-burning phase, @xmath F is also destroyed in the
central regions (below 5 @xmath ) by @xmath F( @xmath ) @xmath Ne. While
the Ne-Na chain is boosted in the H-burning shell of rotating models
(see the peak of @xmath Na at @xmath @xmath ), the Mg-Al chain is not
efficiently activated (no similar peak in the H-burning shell). This is
mainly because the temperature in the H-burning shell is too low (
@xmath MK). Another reason is that the synthesis of extra Al in the
H-burning shell needs extra Mg, which is only built in the He-core when
@xmath MK (through an @xmath -capture on @xmath Ne). In a 20 @xmath
model, this temperature corresponds to the end of core He-burning phase.
The extra Mg created in the core has then little time to be transported
to the H-burning shell and boosts the Mg-Al chain. @xmath Si is the only
isotope that is barely affected by rotation (bottom right panel of Fig.
4.7 ).

As initial rotation increases, the surface is enriched in H-burning
products. This is because of the rotational mixing that transports these
elements from H-burning layers up to the surface. We indeed see that (1)
the surface @xmath He is increased in the faster rotating model, (2) the
effect of CNO burning appears at the surface (less @xmath C and @xmath
O, more @xmath N) and (3) the products of the Ne-Na and Mg-Al cycles are
more abundant (mostly @xmath Na, @xmath Mg and @xmath Al). The surface
abundances change mostly during the main sequence phase because of its
longer duration (the chemical species have more time to be transported).
When reaching the stellar surface, chemical species are potentially
expelled through winds. In these models however, the mass loss
metallicity relation ( @xmath , cf. Sect. 3.3.5 ) plays a major role and
thus prevents significant radiative mass loss episodes. Also the
mechanical mass loss (cf. Sect. 3.3.5 ) stays small for these models.
The 20 @xmath model with @xmath loses about 0.12 @xmath through mechanic
mass loss and 0.6 @xmath through radiative mass loss. The total mass
lost through winds is < 1 @xmath for all the 20 @xmath models. We note
that the mass loss may be strongly enhanced for higher mass stars.

#### 4.3.3 Composition of the ejecta

The effect of varying the initial rotation, mass cut, dilution,
efficiency of rotational mixing, mass and metallicity on the chemical
composition of the source star ejecta is considered.

##### Initial rotation

###### Composition of the wind.

Fig. 4.8 shows the [X/H] ratios in the wind of the models. For all
models, the wind contribution is less than 1 @xmath and comes from the
H-rich region. The non-rotating model (red) is superimposed with the ISM
pattern since the ejected material has kept exactly the same composition
as the ISM. As rotation increases, the wind is overall more and more
enriched in a material processed by the CNO cycle, Ne-Na and Mg-Al
chains (cf. Sect. 4.3.2 ). For the faster rotators, the @xmath C/ @xmath
C ratio is equal to the CNO equilibrium value of @xmath (equivalent to [
@xmath C/ @xmath C] @xmath ).

###### Composition of the H-rich material.

Fig. 4.9 shows the chemical composition of the ejecta when considering
the wind plus all the material above the bottom of the H-rich region. In
this case, @xmath , where @xmath is the mass of the helium core set
where the mass fraction of @xmath H drops below 10 @xmath . From the top
left panel of Fig. 4.6 we see that it corresponds to a total ejected
mass of @xmath @xmath , depending on the model. The typical CNO pattern
appears for all the models (more N, less C and O) but the sum of CNO
elements increases with rotation, as a result of @xmath C and @xmath O
having diffused to the H-burning shell. [Na/H] spans @xmath dex while
[Mg/H], [Al/H] and [Si/H] do not vary more than 0.5 dex. Mg and Al are
overproduced with rotation (Fig. 4.7 ) but only in the He-rich region,
which is not consider in the yields of Fig. 4.9 . @xmath C/ @xmath C is
very close to the CNO equilibrium value.

###### Composition of the H-rich + He-rich material.

Fig. 4.10 is similar as Fig. 4.9 but it considers the wind plus all the
material above the bottom of the He-rich region. In this case, @xmath .
The total ejected mass is about @xmath @xmath , depending on the model
(Fig. 4.5 ). Compared to the previous case, the additional @xmath @xmath
ejected are H-free, so that is raises a bit the [X/H] ratios (by < 0.5
dex). The CNO pattern is reversed compared to Fig. 4.9 because in
He-burning regions, @xmath N is depleted while @xmath C and @xmath O are
abundant (Fig. 4.6 ). No or very little little additional @xmath N is
added to the ejecta compared to Fig. 4.9 . The ratios containing
He-burning products ([Ne/H], [Na/H], [Mg/H] and [Al/H]) are largely
boosted compared to Fig. 4.9 . They also greatly increase with initial
rotation as a result of the back-and-forth mixing process. In He-burning
regions, @xmath C is destroyed by @xmath C( @xmath ) @xmath O so that
the @xmath C/ @xmath C ratio is largely enhanced compared to the case
where only H-rich ejecta is considered. Considering deeper mass cuts
raise again C/H, O/H, Ne/H, Mg/H, and @xmath C/ @xmath C but, overall,
it does not change significantly the trends of Fig. 4.10 .

##### Mass cut in the intershell region

Fig. 4.12 shows the chemical composition of the wind plus an ejecta
defined with various mass cuts, for the @xmath model. The 5 considered
mass cuts are represented in Fig. 4.11 which shows the abundance profile
of the 20 @xmath model with @xmath at the pre-SN stage. The zone between
@xmath @xmath corresponds to the intershell region, in between the H-
and He-burning shells. As @xmath decreases, deeper layers are ejected
and we move progressively from the H-rich only ejecta to a mixed H+He
ejecta. Varying the mass cut from 7 to 8 @xmath leads to a quick
increase of the [X/H] ratios, up to @xmath dex for [C/H]. It illustrates
the high sensitivity of the yields on the mass cut when varying it
around the intershell region.

##### Dilution of the source star ejecta with ISM

The material ejected from the star can be mixed with the material in the
ISM. The effect of the dilution depends on the composition of the ISM,
which is not known at low metallicity (a choice has nevertheless to be
made when computing low metallicity models, as done in this work).
Generally, in the case of the scenario proposing that CEMP-no stars were
formed from one or very few source stars, we can probably just guess
that the ISM is either metal-free or very metal-poor. Table 4.1 reports
how are affected the different abundance ratios in the source star
ejecta while considering either a dilution with a metal-poor ISM or a
metal-free ISM. A dilution with a metal-free ISM adds some H so that the
[X/H] ratios are affected (where X refers to metals). On the other hand,
such an ISM does not modify the [X/Fe] (where X refers to metals) or the
isotopic ratios. In almost all the cases, when the [X/H] or [X/Fe]
ratios are affected by dilution with ISM, they are reduced (cf. Fig.
4.13 and next paragraph). This is because in the source star ejecta, the
H and Fe abundances are similar to the H and Fe abundances in the ISM
while light metals (C to Al) are generally strongly overproduced by the
source star compared to what is present in the ISM.

In this work, when diluting the source star ejecta with ISM, I consider
that the ISM material is the same than the ISM material used to form the
source star ( @xmath -enhanced ISM, cf. Sect. 3.3.4 for details on the
initial composition). To be more quantitative, a dilution factor @xmath
can be defined as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath the total mass ejected by the source star and @xmath the
mass of initial ISM added to the massive star ejecta. The left panel of
Fig. 4.13 shows the chemical composition of the wind plus the H-rich
ejecta for the @xmath model. Different dilution factors are considered.
@xmath means that there is 100 @xmath of ISM for 1 @xmath of source star
ejecta. As @xmath increases, the composition is shifted towards the ISM
composition. The right panel of Fig. 4.13 is similar but for the H-rich
+ He-rich ejecta (like in Fig. 4.10 ). In this case, the amount of light
elements is more important in the source star ejecta so that higher
@xmath values are needed to reach back the ISM pattern. The ISM
considered here is @xmath -enhanced, which explains why the [C/H],
[O/H]… ratios are enhanced compared to the [N/H], [F/H]… ratios. Also,
in this ISM, [ @xmath C/ @xmath C] @xmath , which corresponds to @xmath
C/ @xmath C @xmath (cf. Sect. 3.3.4 ). A more extended discussion about
the @xmath C/ @xmath C ratio can be found in Sect. 4.4 .

At the present day, the dilution factor cannot be strongly constrained.
The point explosion or Sedov-Taylor explosion can be used as an
approximation to estimate how fast will a shock wave travel and what
would be left behind it. For a standard explosion energy of @xmath (
@xmath is the SN energy in units of @xmath ergs) and typical ISM
densities, the ejecta will be mixed with about @xmath @xmath of ISM (
cioffi88 ; ryan96 ; wehmeyer15 ) . For the models of Fig. 4.13 , the
total mass ejected is between @xmath and @xmath @xmath . Taking @xmath
@xmath of ISM leads to a dilution factor of @xmath , which gives @xmath
(in between the cyan and blue patterns in Fig. 4.13 ). This would be for
standard explosions energies. In the case of a low-energetic supernova
with @xmath for instance, @xmath (i.e. @xmath is divided by 10, this is
because @xmath , ryan96 , their Sect. 5.6.1) .

Another way to constrain the dilution factor may be the surface Li
abundance of the CEMP-no stars. We can assume that Li is completely
destroyed in massive stars so that X(Li) @xmath , the Li mass fraction
in the source star ejecta is 0. The Li mass fraction @xmath in the
CEMP-no star natal cloud (possibly different than the value observed
today) is then

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the mass ejected by the source star, and @xmath the Li
abundance in the ISM. The dilution factor can then be expressed as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

We can suppose that the Li abundance in the initial ISM is equal to the
WMAP value of @xmath ( cyburt08 ) . If, as a first guess, we consider
that in situ processes changing the Li abundance did not occur during
the CEMP-no star life, we can take @xmath equal to the observed Li
abundance. If the CEMP-no star has no Li at its surface, @xmath and the
CEMP-no star is made of pure source star ejecta. If the Li abundance is
high, more ISM is needed to form the CEMP-no star. The maximal detected
@xmath for CEMP-no stars is about 2.1 (i.e. around the Spite Plateau
value spite82 ) . It leads to a maximal dilution factor of @xmath , i.e.
all CEMP-no stars would be made of almost pure source star ejecta, even
the most Li-rich.

This estimation of @xmath stays correct as long as (1) in situ processes
changing the Li abundance did not occur in CEMP stars and (2) the Li ISM
abundance is indeed @xmath (value from WMAP). If instead, @xmath for
instance, @xmath , i.e. the source star ejecta may still largely
dominate compared to the ISM (see Fig. 4.13 ). The main uncertainty in
this method are the possible internal processes changing the surface Li
abundance of the CEMP-no stars. korn09 have used models including atomic
diffusion to estimate by how much the surface Li abundance of the dwarf
CEMP-no star HE 1327-2326 was depleted since its birth. At maximum, Li
was depleted by 1.2 dex. It would correspond to an initial Li of @xmath
for HE 1327-2326 and lead to a small @xmath value. Overall, this method
of guessing @xmath is uncertain so precaution is required. It
nevertheless suggests very small dilution factors. This is inconsistent
with the high @xmath values guessed from the Sedov-Taylor theory
assuming standard explosions energies. It might nevertheless be more
consistent with low energetic SNe ( @xmath ), that give smaller @xmath
values (for @xmath however, there is still 1 order of magnitude of
difference at least).

##### Efficiency of the rotational mixing

The @xmath parameter in the @xmath expression (Eq. 3.10 ) was taken
equal to 4 in these models. It is consistent with the surface N/H
enrichments of observed @xmath @xmath rotating stars (cf. Sect. 3.3.1 ).
@xmath corresponds to a critical Richardson number ⁶ ⁶ 6 Physical values
of @xmath are likely between 0.25 and 2, cf. Sect 3.3.1 . @xmath .
@xmath ( @xmath ) is also a reasonable choice, likely consistent with
the observations (cf. Sect. 3.3.1 ).

Fig. 4.14 shows the effect of changing @xmath from 1 to 4. The 2 top
panels show the H-rich (left) and H-rich + He-rich ejecta (right) of the
20 @xmath models with @xmath and with various @xmath . The yields are
barely affected when changing @xmath . The same plots for the 20 @xmath
model with @xmath are shown below. In this case, the effect is much
larger and leads to differences of @xmath dex at maximum. The @xmath
model with @xmath has similar yields than the @xmath model with @xmath .
Changing @xmath does not change the general trends but shifts the yields
upward or downward, for a given initial rotation. To obtain similar
yields as the @xmath , @xmath model while setting @xmath , it is
probably needed to raise @xmath up to about 1. The @xmath @xmath
parameter is important, especially for fast rotators, but its accurate
value is not known.

##### Mass

Figure 4.15 shows the yields of 20, 40 and 60 @xmath models with @xmath
at @xmath . The final yields are rather similar. The 60 @xmath produces
more N because its H-shell is more active than in lower mass models. In
the H-rich layers, more Na is produced in the 20 @xmath models because
the back-and-forth mixing process (Fig. 4.1 ) is more efficient in lower
masses. It is mainly because the process has more time to operate due to
the longer duration of the core helium burning stage. Also, Al and Si
are overproduced in the H-rich layers of the 40 and 60 @xmath because of
the higher H-burning temperature, increasing the efficiency of the
Mg-Al-Si chain. The yields of the 60 @xmath in the H-rich + He-rich
layers show significant differences compared to the other models (right
panel). It is explained by the fact that the He-burning shell becomes
convective in the 20 and 40 @xmath models while it does not for the 60
@xmath model. In the 60 @xmath model, the H-burning shell is very active
and therefore limits the activation of the He-burning shell. In the 20
and 40 @xmath models, while becoming convective, the He-shell engulfs
some @xmath N from the H-rich region. It boosts the production of F and
Na through the chains @xmath N( @xmath ) @xmath N( @xmath ) @xmath F and
@xmath N( @xmath ) @xmath F( @xmath ) @xmath O( @xmath ) @xmath Ne(
@xmath ) @xmath Ne( @xmath ) @xmath Na. The neutrons required to
activate this chain come from @xmath Ne( @xmath ).

##### Metallicity

Figure 4.16 shows the yields (H-rich: left panel, H-rich + He-rich:
right panel) of the 20 @xmath models with @xmath at @xmath (green
pattern) and @xmath (magenta). The two models are computed with the same
physics. The [C/H], [N/H] and [O/H] ratios do not change by more than
0.5 dex from the @xmath the @xmath model. The reason is that the
transport by rotation of @xmath C and @xmath O from the convective
He-burning core to the convective H-burning shell operates at a similar
efficiency in the @xmath model. In the H-rich ejecta (left panel), the
elements from Ne to Si are much less abundant in the @xmath model
compared to the @xmath model. Considering also the He-rich ejecta raises
considerably the abundances of these elements in both models. The
exception is for the [Si/H] ratio in the @xmath model, which stays
several dex below the [Si/H] ratio of the @xmath model. The differences
are mainly due to the fact that the H-burning shell of the @xmath model
is more active, which limits the growth of the convective He-burning
core (at the middle of the core He-burning phase, the size of the
convective He-cores are 3.9 @xmath and 2.7 @xmath in the @xmath and
@xmath models, respectively). The consequence is that less H-burning
products (e.g. @xmath N) let in between the He-core and the H-shell are
engulfed by the convective He-core of the @xmath model. Globally, it has
the effect of reducing the efficiency of the exchanges of material
between the He-core and the H-shell. Finally, the nucleosynthesis is
less rich and varied in the @xmath model. Also, Si is barely affected in
the models considered (see also Fig. 4.7 ) so that the [Si/H] ratio in
the ejecta mostly reflects the initial [Si/H] ratio. In the @xmath
model, the initial Si abundance is zero so that [Si/H] @xmath @xmath
(Si/H) @xmath in the ejecta.

### 4.4 Comparison with CEMP-no stars

It is now discussed whether the abundances of observed metal-poor stars
can be reproduced by the massive stellar models discussed previously.
Particular attention is paid to the constraints provided by the @xmath
C/ @xmath C ratio.

For the observations, I consider CEMP stars with [Fe/H] @xmath and
[C/Fe] @xmath . Recognized CEMP-r, -s and -r/s stars are excluded
(according to the criteria of Table 2.2 ). I took into account the
@xmath [C/Fe] of placco14c which allows to correct the effect of the
first dredge-up of evolved stars and recover the initial C abundance.
For the considered stars, @xmath @xmath [C/Fe] @xmath . With this
correction, 12 stars become CEMP and are then added to the sample. It
gives the 69 stars of Table 4.2 . Stars with @xmath K and @xmath are
classified as main-sequence stars and the other as giants stars ⁷ ⁷ 7
With the exception of G77-61, with @xmath K and @xmath that is
considered as a main-sequence star, following plez05 and beers07 . .

#### 4.4.1 A global comparison

Let us first mention that @xmath source star models may face more
difficulties in reproducing the abundance patterns of CEMP-no stars than
very low metallicity source star models: the 20 @xmath Pop III model in
Fig. 4.16 either produces enough C, N, O but not enough Na, Mg, Al (left
panel) or it produces enough Na, Mg, Al but then C, O and @xmath C/
@xmath C are overestimated (right panel). Also [Si/H] is underestimated
by several dex.

Considering all the other source star models discussed in Sect. 4.3.3 ,
we see that a global match can be found with the abundances of CEMP-no
stars. Source star ejecta with various initial rotation rates, mass cuts
and dilution factors allow to reproduce all or nearly all the range of
CEMP-no star abundances. However, a global match does not mean that
individual CEMP-no stars can be well reproduced. The next step is to
compare source star models with individual CEMP-no stars. As it will be
discussed thereafter (especially in Sect. 4.4.2 ), a more in-depth
comparison reveals some difficulties for models to reproduce some of the
abundances of individual CEMP-no stars.

Interestingly, we also note that the CNO pattern of the material ejected
by the source star has generally either a @xmath -shape (H-rich ejecta,
Fig. 4.9 ) or a @xmath -shape (H-rich + He-rich ejecta, Fig. 4.10 ). It
is nevertheless not always the case (e.g. Fig. 4.12 ). In Table 4.2 ,
very few stars have C, N and O abundances available together, without
upper limits. CS 29498-043 has C,N and O abundances available and it has
a clear @xmath -shape. By contrast, HE 1327-2326 has a clear @xmath
-shape. Another example is the CNO pattern of HE 0107-5240, which has a
different shape (it as much N as O). When considering the entire sample
of Table 4.2 , about 70 % is compatible with a @xmath -shape for the CNO
pattern. Similarly, about 70 % is compatible with a @xmath -shape. About
the same fraction (70 %) of the sample is compatible with an almost flat
CNO pattern. Detailed comparisons between source star models and CEMP
stars are likely required to obtain more informations on the CEMP source
stars (Sect. 4.5 and 4.6 ).

##### Constraints from the @xmathC/@xmathC ratio

The CEMP-no stars with a measured @xmath C/ @xmath C ratio have @xmath
@xmath C/ @xmath C @xmath . Two stars are still dwarfs, with @xmath C/
@xmath C @xmath . As mentioned previously (Sect. 4.2 ), the @xmath C/
@xmath C ratio at the surface of an unevolved CEMP-no star is probably
similar to the @xmath C/ @xmath C ratio in the cloud in which the star
formed, hence similar to the @xmath C/ @xmath C ratio in the source star
ejecta.

The @xmath C/ @xmath C ratios of the CEMP-no star sample are well
reproduced by the H-rich ejecta of the source star models (Fig. 4.9 ).
By contrast, they are largely overestimated by the H-rich + He-rich
ejecta (Fig. 4.10 , cf. also choplin16 , Sect. 5.1, page C of this
thesis) . Of course one could imagine to dilute the H-rich + He-rich
ejecta, having a high @xmath C/ @xmath C, with an ISM having a very low
@xmath C/ @xmath C (as discussed in Sect. 3.3.4 , here I take @xmath C/
@xmath C = 300 in the ISM but a lower value may also be chosen). The
final mixture may present a low @xmath C/ @xmath C ratio, consistent
with observations. In this case however, it just pushes back the
problem: the need for a source producing a large amount of @xmath C in
the early Universe remains and has to be explained by some mechanism.

It is worth mentioning here that Galactic evolution models predict that
a standard population of very low metallicity massive source stars will
lead to a @xmath C/ @xmath C ratio of @xmath in the (almost) primordial
ISM ( chiappini08 ) . If instead, this population is dominated by
massive fast rotators, Galactic evolution models predict @xmath @xmath
C/ @xmath C @xmath . Rotation in massive stars is indeed a way to
produce large amounts of @xmath C (e.g. Fig. 4.6 ). The fact that it
exists CEMP-no stars (especially unevolved stars) with a @xmath C/
@xmath C ratio even lower that 30 suggests that a very special material
is required to form them, maybe coming from the relatively external
layers of one specific rotating massive source star.

As a remark, let us mention that the fact that there is no CEMP star
with a @xmath C/ @xmath C ratio below the CNO-equilibrium value (which
is about 4) suggests that the dominant source of @xmath C in the early
Universe comes from CNO burning. If there was another important source
of @xmath C, we should observe CEMP-no stars with lower @xmath C/ @xmath
C ratios. Moreover if such stars exist, they should be observable since
low @xmath C/ @xmath C ratios are easier to detect: if the ratio is low,
@xmath C is abundant and then @xmath C lines are stronger. This last
point also shows that it can exist a bias towards low @xmath C/ @xmath
C. Some CEMP-no stars have a lower limit for @xmath C/ @xmath C (e.g.
HE 1201-1512 and HE 1327-2326 with @xmath C/ @xmath C @xmath and @xmath
respectively, aoki06 ; norris13 ) . Future observations may reveal a
population of stars with higher @xmath C/ @xmath C ratios.

##### Can the H-rich material of massive source stars explain the
abundances of CEMP-no stars?

In the previous discussion and in Sect. 4.2 , it was proposed that
CEMP-no stars could have formed with only the H-rich material of the
source star. However, if considering only the H-rich source star ejecta,
several issues arise (see Fig. 4.9 ):

1.  The ranges of Mg/H, Al/H and Si/H ratios are not covered by source
    star models (also N and Na to a smaller extent).

2.  The predicted [Al/H] ratios are too high (also true if considering
    the H- + He-rich ejecta, Fig. 4.10 ).

3.  Such an ejecta shows a clear CNO processed signature with a very
    characteristic CNO pattern ( @xmath -shape), while some CEMP-no
    stars are not compatible with this pattern.

4.  The most C-rich CEMP-no stars, with [C/H] @xmath cannot be
    explained.

First, some scatter in the CEMP star abundances is probably induced by
the fact that the abundance data is not homogeneous, together with the
possible 3D/NLTE corrections on abundances (cf. Sect. 2.2.2 and 4.2 ).
This could alleviate the issue 1.

Second, some nuclear reaction rates of the Ne-Na and Mg-Al chains are
uncertain (cf. Sect. 4.2 ). Changing these rates will change the
predicted Na/H, Mg/H, Al/H ratios but in a similar way for all the
models, i.e. the predicted scatter will not change. I computed again the
@xmath model with the nuclear rate of @xmath Al( @xmath ) @xmath Si from
cyburt10 instead of iliadis01 . This is an extreme case, favoring Al
destruction, since the rate of cyburt10 is the highest one below 100 MK.
At @xmath MK, the cyburt10 rate is @xmath times larger than the
iliadis01 rate. The orange dashed line in Fig. 4.9 shows that the [Al/H]
ratio in the ejecta of the model with the cyburt10 decreases by @xmath
dex compared to the standard case. We note that the [Si/H] is barely
modified. Nuclear rate uncertainties can lead to significant differences
in the predicted yields and make the [Al/H] consistent with the bulk of
observed abundances. This helps with the issue 2.

The issues 3 and 4 can be solved if considering the H-rich + He-rich
ejecta (Fig. 4.10 ), which gives much more carbon and reverses the CNO
pattern. Some dilution with the ISM might provide abundance patterns
able to reproduce the observations (right panel of Fig. 4.13 ). However,
in this case, the predicted @xmath C/ @xmath C is too high. The
difficulty here is to get a high enough C/N ratio together with a low
@xmath C/ @xmath C ratio, as it is observed on many CEMP-no stars (Fig.
4.17 ). This issue is discussed in the next section.

#### 4.4.2 The C/N @xmath @xmathC/@xmathC puzzle

##### Standard source star models

In source star models, either both C/N and @xmath C/ @xmath C ratios are
low (H-rich ejecta), or both ratios are high (H-rich + He-rich ejecta).
The crosses in Fig. 4.17 show the ratios in the total wind of some
source star models discussed in the previous section. The tracks show
the variation of the ratios in the ejecta with @xmath let as a free
parameter. A specific @xmath value gives one point in such a track.
Here, for a given source star model, all possible mass cuts are
considered: in Eq. 3.15 , @xmath is varied between 0 and @xmath . It
gives a collection of points, which can be seen as a line.

We see that whatever the source star ejecta considered, none can match
the bulk of observed stars (the tracks are nevertheless consistent with
some lower limit @xmath C/ @xmath C ratios). All models show a similar
behavior. CNO processed material gives @xmath ( @xmath C/ @xmath C)
@xmath and [C/N] @xmath and He-processed material @xmath ( @xmath C/
@xmath C) @xmath and [C/N] @xmath . A mix of CNO and He-processed
material gives something in between, but not in the region where most of
the CEMP-no stars lie.

##### Effect of the first dredge-up in CEMP-no stars

Some CEMP-no stars in Fig. 4.17 are giants (big grey circles) and have
likely experienced the first dredge-up. This process can change the
location of the stars in the C/N @xmath @xmath C/ @xmath C diagram.
Below is investigated by how much and in which direction the first
dredge-up can move a CEMP-no star in this diagram.

First, I started from a reference 0.8 @xmath model having the
composition of the star CS 22958-042 at the Zero-Age Main-Sequence
(ZAMS). CS 22958-042 is a subgiant with [Fe/H] @xmath , [C/Fe] @xmath ,
[N/Fe] @xmath and @xmath C/ @xmath C @xmath ( roederer14c ) . Then, 9
other 0.8 @xmath models were computed with different initial [C/N] and
@xmath C/ @xmath C ratios. Table 4.3 gives the initial ratios of the 10
models. The standard model, having the composition of CS 22958-042,
initially has @xmath ( @xmath C/ @xmath C) @xmath and [C/N] @xmath
@xmath .

The evolution is stopped after the first dredge-up. The thermohaline
mixing is not considered. The surface @xmath ( @xmath C/ @xmath C) and
[C/N] ratios after the first dredge-up are reported in Table 4.3 . The
effect of the first dredge-up on the surface [C/N] and @xmath ( @xmath
C/ @xmath C) ratios of these models is also shown in Fig. 4.17 by the
orange arrows. In all the cases, the surface abundance ratios are
decreased. The decrease ranges from 0 to 0.63 dex. The lower the initial
@xmath C/ @xmath C and C/N ratios, the smaller the effect of the
dredge-up. This is because if starting with @xmath C/ @xmath C and C/N
ratios already close to CN equilibrium in the stellar envelope, then,
adding some material at CN equilibrium barely affects the ratios. On the
opposite, if the initial @xmath C/ @xmath C and C/N ratios are far from
equilibrium, adding a bit of CN-processed material in the envelope has a
stronger impact on the ratios. These results suggest a rather modest
effect of the first dredge-up, except for the CEMP stars that were
formed from a material in which the C/N and @xmath C/ @xmath C ratios
were very far from CN equilibrium (see the biggest orange arrow in Fig.
4.17 ).

##### Other mixing processes in CEMP-no stars

In Fig. 4.17 , some observed evolved CEMP-no stars may also have
experienced other mixing processes like thermohaline (cf. Sect. 2.4 ).
As discussed, however, a significant fraction of CEMP-no stars may not
have experienced too much mixing, except the most evolved stars (cf.
Fig. 2.5 ). Also, it has to be noted that unevolved CEMP-no stars lie
globally at similar positions than evolved CEMP-no stars in Fig. 4.17 .
If the internal mixing processes had a strong impact on the surface C/N
and @xmath C/ @xmath C ratios, we should probably see distinct groups of
CEMP-no stars: the bulk of evolved CEMP-no stars on the one hand, the
bulk of unevolved CEMP-no stars on the other hand. The fact that it is
not the case may finally indicate that the composition of the evolved
CEMP-no stars shown in Fig. 4.17 reflects quite well the composition of
the cloud in which they formed.

### 4.5 The late mixing process in the source star

A solution to the C/N @xmath @xmath C/ @xmath C puzzle is to introduce a
late mixing process in the source star, occurring between the H- and
He-burning shell, about 200 yr before the end of the evolution. Below I
give more details on this process and discuss how it can naturally
produce a material with a high C/N ratio and a low @xmath C/ @xmath C
ratio, able to improve the fit between models and observations. In Sect.
4.8 , I investigate whether other models available in the literature can
provide a solution. This mixing process was investigated in choplin17a .
The main points of the paper are summarized in this section.

#### 4.5.1 General idea

Figure 4.18 shows the time it takes for the C/N, O/N and @xmath C/
@xmath C ratios to reach their CNO equilibrium value in a H-burning zone
at @xmath MK. Results are obtained using the one-zone model described in
Sect. 4.2 . Equilibrium values are reached quicker when the temperature
increases. Whatever the temperature, @xmath C/ @xmath C reaches
equilibrium @xmath times faster than C/N, and C/N reaches equilibrium
@xmath times faster than O/N. In the H-burning shell of a complete
stellar model, there is a gradient of temperature and the temperature
@xmath MK. The global equilibrium timescale of the shell cannot be
deduced directly from Fig. 4.18 . However, the relative difference
between the different timescale stays the same.

Let us now assume that some @xmath C is injected in a single burning
zone at @xmath MK which is at CNO equilibrium. The extra @xmath C
disturbs the CNO equilibrium. Fig. 4.18 tells us that after 2000 yr,
@xmath C/ @xmath C will have reached back its equilibrium value while
C/N and O/N will not. It means that if the H-burning shell of the
massive star is burning at 30 MK and some @xmath C is injected 2000 yr
before the end of the evolution, then, at the pre-SN stage, the H-shell
will have C/N above equilibrium and @xmath C/ @xmath C at equilibrium.
The average temperature in the H-burning shell of a massive source star
is about @xmath MK. Then, to obtain a partially processed CN material,
with C/N above equilibrium and @xmath C/ @xmath C at equilibrium, some
@xmath C has to be injected in the H-burning shell @xmath yr before the
end of the evolution. At this time, the source star burns carbon in its
core. For @xmath @xmath models, the core carbon burning stage lasts for
@xmath yr (grey area in Fig. 4.18 ).

#### 4.5.2 Implementation in source star models

This mixing process was investigated for a grid of six models whose
characteristics are given in Table 4.4 . Small differences exist between
the input parameters of these models and the models of the previous
section. First, when @xmath , the mass-loss rates are from kudritzki00 ,
instead of vink01 . Radiative winds are generally small at low
metallicity so that no big impact is expected. Second, following the
study on Al discussed in Sect. 4.2 , the nuclear rates from the
literature that minimize the production of Al are selected: angulo99 for
@xmath Mg( @xmath ) @xmath Al, cyburt10 for @xmath Al( @xmath ) @xmath
Si and @xmath Al( @xmath ) @xmath Mg. Third, @xmath in the expression of
@xmath (Eq. 3.10 ) was taken equal to 1 instead of 4.

First, the models were computed normally (without late mixing) until the
end of the central silicon-burning phase. The computation is stepped
when the mass fraction of @xmath Si in the core is less than @xmath .
For rotating models, the effects of rotation were taken into account
until the end of the carbon burning phase. Last stages were computed
without rotation. It saves a lot of computational time and leads to only
very small differences in the abundance profiles since the duration of
the last stages is short ( @xmath days, cf. Table 4.4 ) compared to the
rotational mixing timescale. In a second step, I have computed again the
end of the evolution for the six models while triggering the late mixing
process @xmath 200 yr before the end of the evolution (Fig. 4.19 for a
schematic view). For these models, the evolution was stopped at the end
of core carbon burning. Last stages are very short and change only the
composition of the most inner layers. It gives four categories of
models: (1) no rotation, no late mixing, (2) no rotation, late mixing,
(3) fast rotation, no late mixing and (4) fast rotation, late mixing.

To model the late mixing process in rotating models, the shear diffusion
coefficient @xmath is multiplied by a factor of 100 in between the H-
and He-shell. In non-rotating models, an artificial and constant
diffusion coefficient @xmath is set in the mixing zone. This is a
typical value of the diffusion coefficient found in rotating models
including late mixing. Although modeled through the shear diffusion
coefficient, it is not assumed that the physical origin of the late
mixing process is linked to the shear. Its possible physical origin is
discussed in Sect. 4.5.4 .

#### 4.5.3 Comparison with CEMP-no stars

When the late mixing process is included, additional @xmath C and @xmath
O enter into the H-shell, boosting the CNO cycle and then releasing more
energy. The H-shell becomes convective, extends in mass so that more
He-burning products are engulfed. The fresh @xmath C starts to be
transformed into @xmath C and @xmath N in the H-shell. However, the time
remaining before the end of the evolution being short, the [C/N]
equilibrium value of @xmath is not reached. The right panel of Fig. 4.20
shows the abundance profile of the rotating 20 @xmath model with late
mixing, at the end of core carbon burning. We see that the convective
H-shell contains a lot of CNO elements, and has X(C)/X(N) @xmath while
X( @xmath C)/X( @xmath C) is at equilibrium, around 4. This process
builds a zone which is, at the end of evolution, partially processed by
the CN cycle in the source star, where C/N is high and @xmath C/ @xmath
C at equilibrium.

Fig. 4.21 shows the ejecta of the non-rotating (left panel) and rotating
(right panel) 20, 32 and 60 @xmath models including the late mixing
process. With increasing mass, the tracks in Fig. 4.21 are shifted to
the left, away from observations. This is mainly due to the fact that
higher-mass models have a higher temperature in the H-burning shell.
This implies that the CN cycle operates faster. In this case, the
injected @xmath C is transformed more rapidly into @xmath N. Then, the
[C/N] ratio in the H-burning shell is closer to the equilibrium value (
@xmath ) at the end of evolution. It finally implies that the ejecta of
higher-mass models cannot reach high [C/N] ratios together with low
@xmath C/ @xmath C ratios. There are several reasons that may make the
late mixing process more likely to occur in @xmath @xmath source stars
than in @xmath @xmath source stars:

-   In a @xmath @xmath model, the late mixing process should occur very
    late in the evolution, so as to end up with a high C/N (see above).
    If it occurs too early, C/N has enough time to reach back
    equilibrium. It means that the time window for the late mixing to
    operate is shorter in a 60 @xmath model than in a @xmath @xmath
    model.

-   In more massive stars, the mixing process should be extremely strong
    so as to compensate for the short time available.

-   In more massive stars, the distance between the H- and He-burning
    shells is greater, so that the connection between the two shells
    might be less likely.

Overall, @xmath source stars might be better candidates for the late
mixing process, hence for reproducing the observations.

Fig. 4.21 shows that both the non-rotating and rotating 20 @xmath models
can reproduce the bulk of observations. These two kind of models show
however important differences regarding other elements. In fact, the
late mixing process changes the distribution of chemical species in the
source star (Fig. 4.20 ) but in the models presented here, it implies
further nucleosynthesis almost only for the elements ⁸ ⁸ 8 This process
may also form heavy elements through neutron captures, see Sect. 4.8 .
@xmath C, @xmath C and @xmath N. This is because the burning timescales
for the other species considered in the network (e.g. O, Ne, Na, Mg, Al)
are longer compared to the remaining time before the end of the
evolution. For instance, there is little time for the Ne-Na cycle to
operate and produce additional @xmath Na in models including late
mixing. Instead, a progressive mixing, achieved by rotation during the
core helium burning stage can form extra @xmath Na (Sect. 4.3.2 and Fig.
4.7 ). This is an important difference between non-rotating (little Na)
and rotating models (high Na) including late mixing. Many CEMP-no stars
are enriched in Na. It may suggest that, at least for a part of the
CEMP-no star sample, two kind of mixing are needed: rotational mixing
(for Na) and the late mixing process (for a high C/N with a low @xmath
C/ @xmath C).

#### 4.5.4 Physical origin

In the present work, the late mixing process is triggered artificially.
It has to be noted that in some cases, similar events occur naturally.
Indeed, various authors reported sudden ingestion events of H-burning
material into the He-burning core or shell in low or zero metallicity
massive stellar models (with or without rotation, hirschi07 ; ekstrom08
; heger10 ; limongi12 , see also Sect. 4.8 ) . Although observed in some
stellar models, the occurrence conditions and physical process(es)
responsible for such events remain unknown. No specific behaviour is
observed with any stellar parameter.

The treatment of the convection in stellar evolution codes may impact
the shell/shell interaction or the core/shell interaction and thus the
occurrence of the late mixing event. In genec , the convective
boundaries are determined using the Schwarzschild criterion. The
boundaries of the convective zones are sharp (step functions). During
the main sequence and core He-burning phase, the convective core is
extended using a penetrative overshoot. The overshoot is applied neither
for the more advanced phases of stellar evolution, nor for the
intermediate convective shells. This prescription probably does not
capture the whole physics of convection ( arnett15 ) . Multi-dimension
hydrodynamics numerical simulations of convection in deep stellar
interior show that the chemical composition of each side of the
convective boundary makes a smooth transition and is not a step
function. ( herwig06 ; meakin07b ; arnett11 ; cristini17 ) . Fig. 4.22
shows a comparison between 1D code ( genec ) and 3D simulations, for the
carbon burning shell. We see that in 3D, the carbon shell extends
further in mass compared to 1D models. Multi-D simulations of H/He
burning-zones during earlier stages (e.g. core He-burning stage) do not
exist since they are computationally too expansive, mainly because the
burning timescales are long.

It might be that improving the way convection is treated in classical 1D
codes to follow more closely the behavior observed in multi-dimensional
simulations strengthens the exchanges between the H- and He-burning
shells. This could naturally induce the creation of the late mixing
zone. If so, the late mixing invoked in this work would result from an
overly poor description of the convective boundaries in 1D stellar
evolution models.

### 4.6 A systematic study of the CEMP-no source star population

I now investigate what is the best source star model for each individual
CEMP-no star. All the 69 CEMP stars of Table 4.2 are considered. To fit
the abundance pattern of each CEMP star, I consider the 12 source star
models of Table 4.4 and vary the dilution factor and mass cut for each
models. The final structure of the source star is taken at the end of
the core carbon burning stage for all the 12 models since ultimate
stages were not computed for the 6 models including late mixing. Four
dilution factors are considered : @xmath , 10, 100 and 1000. It gives 12
@xmath 4 = 48 combinations. For each of these 48 cases, the mass cut of
the given source star model is varied between its final mass (i.e. only
winds) and @xmath (cf. Table 4.4 ). The mass cut is chosen so as to
minimize the sum of the residuals (in absolute value):

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

@xmath are the [C/H], [N/H], [O/H], [Na/H], [Mg/H] and @xmath C/ @xmath
C) ratios of the CEMP-no star to fit ⁹ ⁹ 9 Table 4.2 reports the [X/Fe]
ratios. For the present analysis, I used the [X/H] ratios (taken from
the SAGA database). . @xmath are the same ratios but in the source star
ejecta, after the eventual dilution with ISM. @xmath is then evaluated
using 1 to 6 abundance ratios. When no abundance or just an upper limit
is available for a CEMP star, the abundance is not considered to
estimate @xmath . For rotating and non-rotating source star models, the
number of possible mass cuts is about 1000 and 500 respectively (it
depends on the resolution, which is higher in rotating models). In
total, there are about 35000 possible ejecta compositions.

For each of the 48 cases, the ejecta composition with the mass cut that
minimizes @xmath is saved. Among these 48 ejecta, the 3 best ones (the 3
lowest @xmath ), are shown in Fig. 4.23 for two CEMP stars. This
procedure was applied for the 69 CEMP stars (all the plots are shown in
Appendix B ). In this sample, I selected the cases where @xmath was
estimated with at least 3 abundances. Fits using only 1 or 2 abundances
can lead to a high degree of degeneracy (many source star models provide
a good solution). After this selection, it gives a subsample of 50
CEMP-no stars (19 stars excluded). In this new sample, the CEMP-no stars
for which no satisfactory fit was found were excluded: fits with @xmath
are excluded. It finally gives 43 stars. The parameters of the best
source star models for these 43 CEMP-no stars are reported in Table 4.5
.

Figures 4.24 , 4.25 and 4.26 show the results. 20 @xmath source stars
are preferred in 70 % of the cases, before the 60 @xmath (23 %) and 32
@xmath (7 %) source stars. Rotation gives the best fit for 74 % of the
sample. The late mixing process appears in 72 % of the best models.
@xmath in 79 % of the cases. Figure 4.25 shows that rotation + late
mixing gives the best fit in 58 % of the cases. The histogram of Fig.
4.26 shows the distribution of the sum @xmath (i.e. the sum of the
ejected fraction of the H-rich envelope, He-shell and CO-core, cf. Table
4.5 ) for the best source star models. This sum varies between 0 (no
material ejected from the source star) and 3 (all the material is
ejected). A value of 1.5, for instance, means that 100 % of the H-rich
envelope plus 50 % of the He-shell of the source star was ejected. The
sum @xmath can also be seen as a mass cut value normalized to 3. Figure
4.26 shows that in most of the cases (about 70 %), @xmath is about 1 or
just above 1. It means that the CEMP-no stars mostly formed with the
H-rich envelope of the source star plus possibly a small part of the
He-shell. In other other words, a mass cut located around the bottom of
the H-rich region of the source star is preferred. It corresponds to
@xmath . In @xmath % of the cases, @xmath . In this case, it suggests a
deeper mass cut in the source star, located around the top or in the CO
core.

The results suggest that the CEMP-no source stars are preferentially
rotating @xmath @xmath models experiencing the late mixing process. In
most cases, only the outer layer of the source star should be expelled.
Also, the results suggest a modest dilution with ISM. In choplin17a , we
investigated the individual abundances of only six CEMP-no stars in
details but reached similar conclusions.

It is worth noting that the late mixing process, developed to explain
the abundances of a small sample of CEMP-no stars in the C/N vs. @xmath
C/ @xmath C diagram (cf. Sect. 4.5 ), is still favored when considering
a larger sample of CEMP stars that often do not have a measured @xmath
C/ @xmath C ratio and/or the N abundance available. One reason is that
standard models with or without rotation tend to give either much more N
than C or much more C than N while numerous CEMP-no stars have roughly
as much C as N. The late mixing process allows to get as much C as N in
the ejecta. Also to note is that, even if both non-rotating and rotating
models including late mixing can provide a solution in the C/N vs.
@xmath C/ @xmath C diagram (cf. Fig. 4.21 ), rotating source stars
models are preferred. One reason is that rotation can provide the
additional Na and Mg needed to reproduce some CEMP-no stars while the
late mixing process cannot.

##### Possible improvements

This analysis can be improved in different ways. Only the best source
star models were considered here. The second best models could also be
considered with smaller weights than the best models. It can also be
done for the third best models, etc… This would allow to also include
the good (but not best) models. It may increase the statistics of the
results. An other improvement could be to attribute weights to the
different abundances used to perform the fit. For instance, the
abundances that are strongly affected by NLTE/3D effects should have a
lower weight. The abundances that are the most affected by nuclear rate
uncertainties in stellar models should also have a lower weight.

In the future, it would be interesting to do the same analysis while
considering larger grids of source star models with more initial masses
and rotation rates, and with different initial metallicities. This could
allow to derive a initial mass or velocity function for the early
generations of massive stars. However, the sample of CEMP-no stars may
still be quite small. Larger (and homogeneous) samples are required so
as to obtain meaningful statistic results.

Finally, let us mention that among the 50 stars fitted (69 in total but
19 were excluded because of a too small abundance data) 7 stars could
not be fitted correctly.

-   3 out of these 7 stars (HE 0107-5240, HE 0557-4840 and
    SDSS J131326.89) have very low [Na/H] and [Mg/H] ratios, at least 1
    dex below the ISM values considered here. No solution can give such
    low values. Zero metallicity source star models may provide a better
    solution. As discussed at the end of Sect. 4.3.3 , zero metallicity
    source stars may produce as much CNO as low metallicity source stars
    but less Na, Mg, Al and Si. This remains to be tested.

-   3 other stars (HE 1506-0113, HE 1012-1540 and HE 2139-5432) have
    high [Na/H] together with low [N/H] ratios. This is difficult to
    explain with the present source star models, where N and Na are
    rather well correlated. In particular, both are produced in rotating
    models.

-   The last star (CS 29498-043) has a CNO pattern very typical of an
    He-burning material but a very low @xmath C/ @xmath C ratio, typical
    of an H-burning material (see Fig. 4.27 ). Although the models with
    extra mixing can approach the solution closer than standard models,
    no satisfactory fit can be found.

Overall, these seven stars may require different kinds of progenitors.
In any case, these stars will require further attention. This is among
the next steps of this analysis.

### 4.7 Are CEMP-no stars helium-rich?

A signature of the operation of the CNO cycle is an enrichment in
helium. Thus, the CEMP-no stars that formed with almost only the
envelope of massive source stars (i.e. @xmath ) should be He-rich (
meynet10 ) . If instead the source star ejecta was significantly mixed
with ISM, the mass fraction of helium @xmath (He) in the CEMP-no star
should be around the primordial value of 0.248 ( cyburt03 ) .

Table 4.5 reports the predicted helium mass fraction in the ejecta
(after dilution) of the best source star models. It shows for instance
that the star CS 22960-053 should have formed with 0.39 of helium in
mass fraction. Fig. 4.28 shows the distribution of helium mass
fractions. While @xmath % of the CEMP star sample is predicted to have
formed with rather normal helium mass fractions ( @xmath (He) @xmath ),
about 40 % should have formed with @xmath (He) @xmath . I discuss below
what are the effects on the evolution of CEMP stars if changing the
initial He. The specific case of the He-rich candidate CS 22949-037,
with @xmath (He) = 0.38, is then investigated.

##### Low-mass metal-poor models enriched in helium

chantereau15 have investigated the evolution of @xmath @xmath stars at
[Fe/H] @xmath with an initial He mass fraction @xmath between 0.248 and
0.8. As @xmath increases, the opacity in the stellar interior is
reduced, making the star more compact. This shifts the evolutionary
tracks towards higher @xmath . The higher compactness of the star makes
the central temperature higher, increasing the rate at which hydrogen is
burnt. This, together with the fact that there is less hydrogen fuel in
helium rich stars, lead to shorter main sequence lifetimes for the
helium rich models. Their 0.8 @xmath models with @xmath (standard),
@xmath and @xmath spend 12.9, 4.62 and 0.16 Gyr on the main sequence,
respectively.

To investigate the specific case of the CEMP-no star CS 22949-037, I
computed non-rotating 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9 @xmath stellar models
starting with the chemical composition of CS 22949-037. For each mass,
different initial helium mass fractions are tested: 0.25, 0.3, 0.4 and
0.5. What is added to the initial helium mass fraction is removed from
the initial hydrogen mass fraction. The OPAL tool was used to compute
new opacity tables accordingly to the particular composition of
CS 22949-037. For the other input parameters, I followed ekstrom12 .

Fig. 4.29 shows the tracks of these models. The observations of
CS 22949-037 are better reproduced by the tracks having @xmath @xmath
and @xmath . This is consistent with the analysis of Sect. 4.6 which
predict @xmath for CS 22949-037. However, because of uncertainties on
both the modeling and observational sides, it is difficult to make
meaningful comparisons between the observations and the tracks of Fig.
4.29 .

Considerations on the age of CS 22949-037 can give additional hints. The
color of the track shows the age of the model. To match the observables,
the tracks of Fig. 4.29 have to reach the @xmath and @xmath of
CS 22949-037 at the age of CS 22949-037. For instance, while the 0.9
@xmath model with @xmath seems a good candidate, it reaches the @xmath
and @xmath of CS 22949-037 after only @xmath Gyr. It is unlikely that
CS 22949-037 is only 4 Gyr old. On the other hand, the 0.5 @xmath model
(still with @xmath ) is not a solution since it would still be unevolved
today, with a much higher @xmath than CS 22949-037. We can see that if
CS 22949-037 has @xmath , it should be between 0.6 and 0.7 @xmath .

We see here that the scenario investigated in this work to explain
CEMP-no stars predicts that some of the CEMP-no stars (the ones that are
He-rich) will have rather small masses, due to their He-richness. Both
the determination of the helium abundance and the mass of the CEMP-no
stars may provide further clues on their origin.

##### Measuring the helium abundance and the mass of CEMP-no stars

Helium is challenging to detect and direct measurements are rare. One
possibility is to focus on the HeI line at @xmath @xmath m that forms in
the upper chromosphere of cool stars. In doing so, pasquini11 managed to
measure the difference in helium abundance for two giants stars ([Fe/H]
@xmath 1.22 and @xmath ) in the globular cluster NGC 2808. With their
chromospheric model, they found a difference of 0.17 in helium mass
fraction, meaning that if one of the two star has a solar He abundance,
the other would have @xmath . Also, dupree13 reported an helium
abundance of @xmath and @xmath in two other giant stars ([Fe/H] @xmath
and @xmath ) belonging to the globular cluster @xmath Centauri. In
CEMP-no stars and generally in very iron-poor stars, no helium
measurements has been performed yet.

Let us mention that asteroseismology may provide the mass of giants
CEMP-no stars. The asteroseismic information (hence the mass) of cool
giant stars with @xmath may be obtained with the Kepler K2 mission (e.g.
stello15 ) . Another way to have a direct estimation of the mass is if
the CEMP-no star is in an eclipsing binary system: since the inclination
of an eclipsing system is known, masses of the two stars can be
determined from the Kepler’s laws. Tracks of stellar models computed
with the right masses and with various helium abundances may allow to
get an estimation of the helium abundance of these observed stars.

##### Proxies for the helium abundance

Some abundances of other elements may give a proxy for the helium
abundance. A high helium abundance requires a small dilution factor
otherwise the helium abundance goes back towards the ISM value of @xmath
. A small dilution factor might be related to a low Li abundance (Sect.
4.3.3 , paragraph about dilution), meaning that He-rich CEMP stars could
also be Li-poor (caution is required since Li is a fragile element that
can be heavily affected by various processes in the CEMP star itself).
Interestingly, the He-rich candidate CS 22949-037 has a very low Li
abundance (A(Li) @xmath ). Two other He-rich candidates, CS 22960-053 (
@xmath (He) @xmath ) and HE 2331-7155 ( @xmath (He) @xmath ), have A(Li)
@xmath and A(Li) @xmath , respectively. He-rich candidates are
nevertheless not always Li-poor (e.g. CS 22960-053 with a predicted
helium abundance of @xmath (He) @xmath and a Li abundance, deduced from
observations, of A(Li) @xmath ).

It is also worth noting that the He-rich CEMP stars should probably not
be searched among the CEMP stars having a @xmath -shape CNO pattern (cf.
Sect. 4.4.1 ). It may be surprising since it is a pattern characteristic
of a material processed by He-burning, hence potentially He-rich.
However, when a CEMP star is predicted to be formed with the
He-processed material of the source star, a high dilution factor is
generally also predicted (often @xmath , see Table 4.5 ) so that the
final helium abundance (the one of the CEMP) is close to the ISM value
of 0.25. Instead, it is predicted here that many He-rich CEMP stars
should have a @xmath -shape CNO pattern. This pattern is characteristic
of an ejecta processed by H-burning. Such an ejecta is also enriched in
helium (provided the dilution with ISM is small).

### 4.8 Other CEMP-no source star models

#### 4.8.1 An energetic H-ingestion event in the source star

Let us first mention the recent work of clarkson18 , that investigated
the origin of the 3 most iron-poor stars with a non-rotating 45 @xmath
source star model experiencing an energetic H-ingestion event during
shell He burning. It is interesting in the frame of the present work
since the ingestion process they consider is similar to the late mixing
process described in Sect. 4.5 . In their work, nucleosynthesis was
calculated in post-processing, using a one-zone model. They found that
after the H-ingestion event, neutron densities of @xmath cm @xmath are
reached (typical of the i-process), leading to neutron captures on light
seeds. These neutron captures allow the synthesis of small amounts of
heavier elements like Ca (not much heavier elements than Ca are
synthesized). Globally they found a reasonable agreement for 2 out of
the 3 iron-poor stars considered. One difficulty is that neutron
captures in the source star model do not produce enough Fe so that an
additional enrichment process is required. Also, one of the star they
reproduce (HE 1327-2326) has [Sr/Fe] @xmath . It is not mentioned if
their models can account for it. The origin of Sr in HE 1327-2326 is
investigated in the Sect. 5.4.2 of this work.

#### 4.8.2 Other source star models in the C/N @xmath @xmathC/@xmathC
diagram

It is now investigated whether various massive source star models from
different authors can provide a solution in the C/N @xmath @xmath C/
@xmath C diagram. Low or zero metallicity massive star models with
available yields are considered. Some intermediate mass models are also
included (see the legend of Fig. 4.30 for the complete list of models).
In the non-rotating @xmath @xmath Pop III models of heger10 , explosive
nucleosynthesis is calculated and various assumptions for the mixing (in
the sense of the mixing & fallback process of umeda02 ) and the
explosion energy are considered. Explosive nucleosynthesis is also
calculated in the non-rotating @xmath Pop III stars of limongi12 .

The composition of the ejecta of all the considered models is shown in
Fig. 4.30 . The observations lie in a very small zone (black frame)
compared to the region occupied by the source star models. Worth to
remind is that some CEMP-no stars have an upper limit for N and/or a
lower limit for @xmath C/ @xmath C. It means that it might exist an
unseen population of stars with higher @xmath C/ @xmath C and C/N
ratios. For what regards the observations without upper/lower limits,
only a small fraction of the source star models could possibly account
for them.

Fig. 4.31 shows a zoom in the region where observations lie. Models of
limongi12 consider standard core collapse supernovae, with @xmath and
deep mass cuts. As they say (see also Fig. 4.30 and 4.31 ), this
assumption likely cannot account for the majority of the most metal-poor
stars. It is similar for the models of ekstrom08 where a deep mass cut
is considered, following the relation of maeder92 . Higher mass cut
values (closer to the stellar surface) in the models of limongi12 and
ekstrom08 may improve the fit between models and observations. AGB
models may account for some observations but there are generally away
from the majority of CEMP-no stars. Models approaching the most the bulk
of observed stars are (1) some non-rotating @xmath @xmath Pop III models
from heger10 , represented by big blue circles, and (2) fast-rotating 40
and 85 @xmath models with @xmath from hirschi07 .

##### A fast rotating massive source star with extreme mass loss

Let us first summarize the peculiar evolution of the fast rotating 85
@xmath model of hirschi07 , that leads to [C/N] @xmath and @xmath (
@xmath C/ @xmath C) @xmath in the ejecta (big red star in Fig. 4.31 ).
From the beginning of the core helium burning stage, @xmath C and @xmath
O diffuse progressively to the radiative H-shell. At the middle of the
core helium burning phase, the helium convective core encroaches the
H-shell so that the CNO cycle is suddenly boosted in the H-shell and a
copious amount of @xmath N and @xmath C is quickly formed. The energy
released makes the H-shell convective. This CNO-rich convective zone
quickly reaches the stellar surface so that the surface metallicity is
enhanced and dramatic mass loss occurs, removing about 60 @xmath from
the star. The material ejected is only partially processed by the CNO
cycle because the convective zone extends very quickly in cold regions
where the CNO cycle operates slowly or does not operate at all. In
addition, the strong mass loss episode occurs also quickly after the
encroaching of the H-shell, saving definitely the material from further
processing. From the instant of the encroaching of the H-shell to the
instant where strong mass loss stops, only @xmath Myr have past.
Finally, the model (which is now about 25 @xmath ) finishes to burn
helium in its core (and then subsequent burning stages occur normally).
The big red star in Fig. 4.31 shows the chemical composition in the wind
of this model, which is indeed partially CNO processed.

##### H/He interaction in non-rotating massive source stars

Some @xmath @xmath models of heger10 experience a similar encroaching
(cf. previous paragraph) of the He-core with the H-shell, as they
mention in their paper. Also, as they note, in some models, the
encroaching occurs during the core carbon burning stage, between the He-
and H-burning shells (like for the late mixing process, cf. Sect. 4.5 ).
In both cases, it produces a lot of @xmath C and @xmath N. Mass loss was
taken equal to zero in their models so that no material is ejected
through winds. However, some material is likely saved in cold regions
from further CNO processing until the end of the source star evolution.
It leads to a partially processed CNO material in the ejecta as shown by
some of the blue points in Fig. 4.31 that approach the bulk of observed
CEMP-no stars.

##### A strong H/He interaction: a characteristic shared by the best
source star models?

All the models able to fit the observations in the [C/N] @xmath @xmath
C/ @xmath C diagram (including the models of this work discussed in
Sect. 4.5 ) likely share a common feature: a strong interaction between
the H- and He-region occurred in the source star, boosting the CNO
cycle, but right after, the material was saved from further CNO
processing (either by being ejected quickly, or by being saved in cold
regions of the source star until a supernova expels these layers). The
fact that this interaction occurs also in non-rotating models (e.g.
heger10 ) may indicate that the origin of the phenomena is not entirely
due to rotation. Rotation may facilitate such interactions. As discussed
in Sect. 4.5.4 , the main ingredient might be convection. Convection
constitutes a major uncertainty that should be better constrained in the
future thanks to multi-D simulations.

This said, the present work suggests that this strong interaction
between the H- and He-regions is required but not sufficient to explain
the CEMP-no stars. The special nucleosynthesis induced by the
progressive rotational mixing at work in the source star also appears to
be needed to account for the abundances of CEMP-no stars (e.g. Sect. 4.6
).

##### The mass of the source stars

Models of hirschi07 and heger10 in Fig. 4.31 suggest that the CEMP-no
source stars could have initial masses of @xmath @xmath while this work
suggest lower masses, about 20 @xmath (e.g. Fig. 4.24 ). heger10
investigated the origin of the CEMP stars HE 0107-5240 and HE 1327-2326
with their Pop III massive models. In both cases, the best fits are
given by their @xmath @xmath source star models. Similarly to umeda03 ,
an artificial mixing episode is included is their models at the time of
the supernova in order to mix a little bit of iron in upper stellar
layers. The iron is then expelled and the little iron content of
HE 0107-5240 and HE 1327-2326 can be reproduced. placco16 have used the
models of heger10 to investigate the origin of 12 stars with [Fe/H]
@xmath . They found that the best fits are given by @xmath @xmath models
(in both studies, the @xmath C/ @xmath C ratio is not considered). Also,
in these works, comparisons are made through the [X/H] ratios but no
dilution with primordial ISM was considered. It likely means that the
yields of the source stars models considered should be seen as upper
limits since any dilution with primordial ISM will decrease the [X/H]
ratios. Some caution is therefore required.

From Fig. 4.30 and 4.31 , we see that the @xmath @xmath of heger10 are
not reproducing the bulk of observations. Fig. 4.31 rather suggests that
their models with @xmath @xmath may be better source stars. In the
present section, since the comparison is made using only few abundances
(C and N), it is not possible to conclude further. It suggests that
tensions probably exist and that the preferred masses of the CEMP-no
source stars may require further investigations.

### 4.9 Summary

This chapter has investigated the origin of the CEMP stars with [Fe/H]
@xmath and not significantly enriched in s- and/or r-elements (CEMP-no
stars). The main results are summarized below.

The high abundance scatter (especially for C, N, O, Na, Mg and Al) of
these stars was suggested to originate from a material ejected by
previous massive source stars that experienced various degree of
rotational mixing. A part of the CEMP-no star sample is thought to have
formed mainly with the H-burning shell of the massive source star.
During the core He-burning phase of rotating source stars, He-burning
products are transported to the H-burning shell by the operation of the
rotational mixing. Once into the H-shell, these products are further
processed by H-burning and transported back to the He-burning core, etc.
I developed a one-zone nucleosynthesis model that mimics the H-burning
shell of a rotating massive star. The effect of rotation was modeled by
progressively injecting He-burning products ( @xmath C, @xmath O, @xmath
Ne and @xmath Mg) in the burning zone. The ranges of abundances of the
considered CEMP-no stars were found to be overall well reproduced by a
material processed by H-burning at a temperature and density
characteristic of @xmath @xmath source stars. To reproduce the
observations, this material should be enriched, while burning, in @xmath
C, @xmath O and occasionally @xmath Ne. This suggests that the CEMP-no
source stars experienced mid to strong rotational mixing.

Source stars models with various initial masses, rotation rates and
metallicities were computed. As the result of the rotation induced
mixing during the core He-burning phase, the yields of elements from C
to Al scale with initial rotation. In the fastest rotating model, the
[X/H] ratios in the ejecta can be boosted by @xmath to @xmath dex
compared to the non-rotating model. The mass cut and the dilution of the
source star ejecta with ISM are important and weakly constrained
parameters, that strongly affect the source star yields. Overall, a
global match between the abundances of CEMP-no stars and very low
metallicity 20 @xmath source star models with various initial rotation
rates can be found. The low @xmath C/ @xmath C ratio (especially on
unevolved CEMP-no stars) requires that no or little material processed
by He-burning was expelled from the source star. In this case however,
[C/N] @xmath , which does not account for the bulk of CEMP-no stars,
that generally have higher [C/N] ratios. The source star ejecta either
have low @xmath C/ @xmath C ratios together with low [C/N] ratios or
high @xmath C/ @xmath C ratios together with high [C/N] ratios. It
cannot fit the bulk of CEMP-no stars.

A solution to improve the fit is to include a late mixing process in the
massive source star, operating in between the H-burning and the
He-burning shell, about 200 yr before the end of the source star
evolution. It may occur preferentially in @xmath @xmath source stars
(both rotating and non-rotating). This additional process was studied by
computing new source star models with initial masses of 20, 32 and 60
@xmath , without and with fast rotation, without and with the late
mixing process (12 models). Using the yields of these 12 source star
models, an automatic abundance fitting procedure was applied to the
CEMP-no stars with [Fe/H] @xmath . I found that the best CEMP-no source
stars are preferentially rotating 20 @xmath models that experienced the
late mixing process, that ejected the layers above or just below the
interface between the H-rich and He-rich region and whose ejecta
underwent a modest dilution with the ISM.

Finally, to avoid confusion, I recall the three different kinds of
mixing that may arise in the source star:

-   The mixing induced by rotation that occurs progressively and
    everywhere, during the entire life of the source star.

-   The late mixing process (Sect. 4.5 ) arising between the H-burning
    shell and He-burning shell, shortly before the end of the evolution
    ¹⁰ ¹⁰ 10 It may also occur earlier in the evolution, between the
    H-burning shell and He-burning core, cf. Sect. 4.8 . .

-   The mixing in the sense of umeda02 that occurs between two limiting
    shells, at the time of the supernova.

## Chapter 5 The s-process in CEMP source stars

The previous chapter focused on light elements, from C to Si. These
elements are of particular interest for studying the origin of the most
iron poor stars (with [Fe/H] @xmath ) that are mostly CEMP-no stars. The
reason is that these stars are often strongly enriched in such elements
while, by definition, they are generally little enriched in heavier
elements.

Many CEMP stars show overabundances in s-elements, especially at higher
metallicities ( @xmath [Fe/H] @xmath ), but also sometimes at very low
metallicity (e.g. HE 1327-2326 with [Fe/H] @xmath and [Sr/Fe] @xmath ).
The weak s-process is expected to occur in massive stars (provided the
metallicity is not zero). As mentioned in Sect. 3.1.2 (also Fig. 4.1 ),
the effect of rotation in massive stars can alter the production of
s-elements. At very low/zero metallicity, the amount of seed (especially
iron) is very low so that little s-elements can be produced. At higher
metallicities, there are more seeds, hence possibly more s-elements.

The main purpose of this chapter is to extend the study to heavier
elements that can be formed in the source stars through the s-process.
The s-process is studied in a new grid of massive source stars at [Fe/H]
@xmath together within lower metallicity source star models. Then, I
investigate whether the nucleosynthetic signatures of these massive
stars can be recognized in observed metal-poor stars. A very recent
paper (in Sect. 5.2 ) and a letter (in Sect. 5.3 ) are directly included
in this chapter. Additional results and discussions are included,
particularly in Sect. 5.4 .

### 5.1 The weak s-process in a box

Before investigating complete stellar models, the s-process in a single
burning zone is discussed. Using a similar code as in Sect. 4.2 but that
now mimics the He-burning core of massive stars (this is mostly where
the s-process operates, cf. Sect. 3.1.2 ), the s-process in massive
stars can be studied qualitatively. The single burning zone considered
burns at @xmath MK and @xmath g cm @xmath , as characteristic values of
the He-burning core of massive stars. The initial mass fractions in the
zone are @xmath for @xmath He, @xmath for @xmath O, @xmath for @xmath C
and @xmath for @xmath Fe (in mass fraction). The initial mass fraction
of @xmath Ne is varied from @xmath to 0.05. The calculation is stopped
when all the @xmath He is burnt. The final chemical patterns in the
burning zone are shown in Fig. 5.1 .

When increasing the initial @xmath Ne, heavier s-elements are produced
at the expense of lighter s-elements. If little @xmath Ne is available,
the neutron flux is small and only light s-elements are produced. When
the initial @xmath Ne mass fraction is 0.05, the pattern becomes
flatter. It shows the effect of changing the source ( @xmath Ne) over
seed ( @xmath Fe) ratio. If this ratio increases (provided some
reasonable amount of seed is present) the hs (heavy s-elements) over ls
(light s-elements) ratio increases.

Fig. 5.2 illustrates the poisoning effect of @xmath O by changing the
initial @xmath O mass fraction. For higher initial @xmath O mass
fractions, the production of s-elements is reduced. This is because if
@xmath O is more abundant, the @xmath O( @xmath ) @xmath O( @xmath )
@xmath Ne chain is boosted, so that less neutrons are available for
heavy elements.

### 5.2 A new grid of massive stars with rotation and s-process

Grids of massive stellar models including rotation and full s-process
network are needed in order to investigate the role of such stars in the
chemical enrichment of the Universe. To date, only frischknecht16 and
very recently limongi18 have provided such grids. An important part of
my work was to compute a new grid of massive rotating star with full
s-process, so as to extend the study of frischknecht16 . The final goal
being to gain knowledge on the nature of such massive stars by comparing
their yields to the abundances of observed low-mass metal-poor stars
enriched in s-elements.

In choplin18 we computed a new grid of massive stars with initial masses
between 10 and 150 @xmath , at a metallicity @xmath in mass fraction
(corresponding to [Fe/H] @xmath ). The models were computed either
without rotation or with @xmath . We considered only one metallicity but
significantly extended the range of mass compared to the study of
frischknecht16 , that focused on @xmath @xmath models. We also
investigated the impact of a faster initial rotation and a different
@xmath O( @xmath ) @xmath Ne reaction rate. Most of the physical
ingredients of this grid are the same than for the models discussed
previously. The main change is the size of the nuclear network that now
comprises 737 species, from @xmath H to @xmath Po instead of 31 species
(cf. Sect 3.3.3 ).

The paper describing the models is directly included in the thesis (in
the present section). It was very recently accepted in A&A and I have
therefore almost no discussion to add yet. Before the paper itself, I
discuss several aspects that were not published: several additional
physical ingredients and some obstacles I had to overcome. In Appendix
A.5 , additional parameters, allowing to quantify the efficiency of the
s-process, are defined and tabulated for the new grid of models. The
table was not published in the paper but it may be useful to have these
quantities for future comparisons with other models.

#### 5.2.1 Nuclear network and reaction rates

As shown in Table 2 of the paper below, 8 important nuclear reaction
rates were updated compared to the study of frischknecht16 . Originally,
the reaction rate format in stellar evolution codes is the following:
one table for each reaction rate with two columns, one for the
temperature, one for the associated rate. Then, interpolations are done
in these tables to evaluate the rates at the desired temperatures. With
large networks, it is convenient to use analytical reaction rates such
as in the reaclib format ( cyburt10 ) in order to save computational
time. Such a format allows to express a reaction rate with @xmath sets
of 7 parameters @xmath . For 2-body reactions, it yields

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath and @xmath the Avogadro number. For 1- and 3-body reactions,
the left side of Eq. 5.1 is respectively equal to @xmath and @xmath ,
where @xmath represents the photodisintegration or @xmath -decay rate.
If just the standard tabulated rate exists, one has to find the @xmath
parameters that allow to fit correctly the rate. A leastsquare method is
used to estimate these parameters from a temperature-rate table. @xmath
is often required to reach a reasonable accuracy. Finding the @xmath
parameters can sometime be challenging, mainly because of the large
range of temperature to be covered (several orders of magnitude, it
depends on the reactions). Once the @xmath parameters are determined for
the forward reaction, the @xmath parameters for the reverse reaction can
be easily calculated ( rauscher00 ) .

best13 provided, in the tabular form, new rate measurements for the
@xmath O( @xmath ) @xmath Ne and the @xmath O( @xmath ) @xmath Ne
reactions, that are of crucial importance for the s-process in massive
stars. I used the fitting method described in rauscher00 to convert
these tabulated rates into the reaclib format. For the two fits, I found
that @xmath provides satisfactory results: the final deviation is less
than 5 % (Fig. 5.3 , only one of the two fit is shown).

#### 5.2.2 The @xmath and @xmath profiles

When first trying to reproduce the results of frischknecht16 , I found
significantly different results: many s-elements were underproduced by a
factor of 100 in the new models. It was caused by strong oscillations of
the @xmath coefficient in between the H- and He-burning zones, during
the core He-burning stage. The green profile in the left panel of Fig.
5.4 shows such oscillations. The low values of @xmath at @xmath strongly
reduces the exchanges of material between the He-core and the H-shell,
leading to a smaller synthesis of primary @xmath N and @xmath Ne (Fig.
5.4 , right panel, green line). Such @xmath oscillations are likely not
physical since their shape change or disappear when changing the model
resolution. An example is shown by the blue profiles in Fig. 5.4 : the
resolution of this model ( res- model in Fig. 5.4 ) is reduced compared
to the green model ( res+ model) but it is still enough to see the
eventual @xmath oscillations. In this case, the @xmath does not
oscillate so that the mixing is not cut and more @xmath N and @xmath Ne
are synthesized compared to the green model (Fig. 5.4 , right panel).
While the changes induced by the presence or the absence of oscillations
are not huge for @xmath N and @xmath Ne (factor of about 5), they are
much more significant for s-elements (factor of about 100 at maximum, as
shown in Fig. 5.5 ). Models of frischknecht16 are similar to the blue
lines in Fig. 5.4 and 5.5 while new models to the green lines.

To improve the stability of the code and find similar results when
changing the mesh number, I improved the way of calculating @xmath (Eq.
3.10 ), by trying to better evaluate the derivative of @xmath and @xmath
, that appeared to be responsible for the oscillation of the @xmath
coefficient. The oscillation problem is solved if properly smoothing the
@xmath and @xmath profiles when calculating their derivatives (see
Appendix A.4 for more details). If applied, this technique gives similar
results when changing the mesh number (see Fig. 5.4 , black and red
profiles). It also gives similar s-process yields compared to the models

### 5.3 The origin of the single CEMP-s stars

As discussed in Sect. 2.5 , CEMP-s stars are generally explained with
the AGB binary scenario. This scenario predicts that the CEMP-s should
have a white dwarf companion (cf. Fig. 2.6 ). The CEMP-s stars that
appear to be single ( hansen16a ) may challenge the AGB scenario.

#### 5.3.1 Massive source stars

In choplin17letter , we have investigated the origin of the four
apparently single CEMP-s stars in light of the new grid of massive stars
including rotation and s-process presented in the previous paper. The
abundances of the apparently single CEMP-s stars are reported in Table
5.1 . We found that 3 out of the 4 CEMP-s stars can be well reproduced
by the yields of the fast rotating ( @xmath ) 25 @xmath model that was
computed with the rate of the @xmath O( @xmath ) reaction divided by 10.
The dilution factors @xmath are between 4 and 20 and in all the cases,
the mass cut @xmath . In general, the other models of the grid do not
provide enough s-elements. If deep layers are expelled some models may
nevertheless provide enough s-elements but in this case, Na, Mg and Al
are overestimated by several order of magnitudes compared to the
observations. These results show that some s-rich metal-poor ([Fe/H]
@xmath ) halo stars may have formed with a material that was enriched by
the ejecta of a previous fast rotating massive source star. It gives
support to the spinstar scenario at higher metallicities (compared to
the lower metallicities considered in Chapter 4 ).

The late mixing process introduced in Sect. 4.5 is not considered in
these new CEMP source star models. This process will mostly affect the C
and N abundances. It may nevertheless also synthesize heavier elements
through neutron captures ( clarkson18 , cf. also Sect. 4.8 ) . Including
the late mixing process in the models with an extended network is among
the possible next steps of this work. However, it is not excluded that
the late mixing process occurs only at very low metallicity (maybe
[Fe/H] @xmath ), and not in these new source star models, with [Fe/H]
@xmath . The reason is that at very low metallicity, source stars are
more compact so that the H- and He-burning shells are closer from each
other. It might imply an easier interaction of these two shells. This is
however speculative and deserves more investigation.

See aa31948-17.pdf

#### 5.3.2 The AGB scenario

Below is discussed some aspects of the AGB binary scenario for the four
stars of the previous letter. abate15b ; abate15a have used a binary
evolution and population synthesis code to predict the orbital
properties of the system (CEMP-s + AGB). The chemical composition in the
AGB intershell region, from AGB models of lugaro12 , is used. The
abundances are function of 3 quantities: the mass of the AGB star at the
first thermal pulse, the thermal pulse number and the mass of the
partial mixing zone (cf. Sect. 3.2 ). The procedure is discussed in
details in abate15b ; abate15a .

Because of its high Pb abundance, the apparently single CEMP-s star
CS 30301-015 discussed in the previous letter likely cannot be
reproduced if considering only the massive stars ejecta computed in this
work. The best AGB fit for this CEMP-s star (shown in Fig. 5.6 , top
panel) is a 2.6 @xmath AGB star with a period (at the present day) of
about @xmath days. Although not perfect, the fit is improved compared to
what can be done with massive stars. In particular, Pb can be
reproduced. Also, the long predicted period provides a simple
explanation to why this CEMP-s star appears to be single: its orbits is
so wide that no radial-velocity variations can be detected. It is
consistent with the statement of hansen16a that reported that any
undiscovered binaries among their four apparently single CEMP-s stars
would have periods of at least @xmath days.

For HE 1045+0226 (bottom panel in Fig. 5.6 ), AGB star models predict
too low Y and Zr. Also, the predicted period for HE 1045+0226 is about
40 days, which is too short to explain the non-detection of radial
velocity variations. For this star, a massive rotating source stars
provides a better solution (cf. previous letter). For the two other
CEMP-s stars, only the Ba abundance is available among the heavy
elements so that both massive stars and AGB star models can provide a
reasonable solution.

Generally speaking, massive stars tend to produce larger light s-element
(e.g. Sr) over heavy s-element (e.g. Ba, Pb) ratios than AGB stars.
Another difference, as discussed in the previous letter, is the oxygen,
that can be higher by @xmath dex in massive stars compared to AGB stars.
Some CEMP-s stars are O-rich, a characteristic that AGB models may not
be able to account for. For instance CS 31080-095 has [O/Fe] @xmath (
sivarani06 ) , LP625-44 has [O/Fe] @xmath ( aoki02c ) , HE 2258-6358 has
[O/Fe] @xmath ( placco13 ) . Such high ratios do not exclude a
contribution from an AGB companion but may indicate a contribution of
one (or more) additional source (i.e. previous massive stars). By
detailed comparisons between AGB and massive star models, it would
probably be interesting to try to spot the elements like oxygen that
could help probing the nature of the additional source(s).

### 5.4 The weak s-process at lower metallicities

With decreasing metallicity, less seed is available so that less
s-elements are produced. In non-rotating models, the production of
s-nuclei in massive stars becomes negligible below about @xmath @xmath
@xmath ( prantzos90 ) . In rotating models, this metallicity threshold
may be around @xmath : frischknecht16 have shown that at @xmath ,
rotation in a 25 @xmath model has a modest effect on the abundances of
s-elements. At very low metallicity, the lack of iron seed implies that
even if the neutron source is boosted by rotation, there is no
significant s-process boost. Also, it is worth mentioning that above an
given metallicity threshold, the s-process boost induced by rotation
becomes very small: at @xmath , frischknecht16 have shown that the
abundance patterns of rotating and non-rotating models are almost
identical. This is because rotation does not provide much additional
@xmath Ne (neutron source) at this metallicity, as a result of the less
efficient back-and-forth mixing process (Sect. 4.1 ). Indeed, at higher
metallicity the distance between the He-core and the H-shell increases
and the gradient of @xmath is smaller so that the shear mixing between
the He-core and the H-shell is less strong.

#### 5.4.1 A rotating 25 @xmath model with various initial metallicities

The computation of grids of massive star models at lower metallicities
(including s-process) is a work in progress. Only 25 @xmath models are
presented here. Fig. 5.7 shows the ejected mass (Eq. 3.15 ) of four
isotopes for rotating 25 @xmath models with @xmath , @xmath and @xmath .
As the metallicity decreases by 2 dex, the ejected mass of the
considered isotopes decreases by @xmath dex, depending on the chemical
specie. The green and red patterns in Fig. 5.8 show the production
factors (Eq. 3.17 ) of a non-rotating and a rotating 25 @xmath model at
@xmath , respectively. Compared to their initial abundances, elements
between Cu and Y are overproduced by @xmath dex in the rotating model.
The black pattern shows an extreme case, with fast rotation and a lower
@xmath O( @xmath ) reaction rate (/10). In this case, the production of
elements between Fe and Eu are enhanced by 1 up to about 3 dex compared
to their initial abundances. Overall, it shows that at very low
metallicity, although the absolute yields are low (Fig. 5.7 ), rotation
can strongly affect the distribution of heavy elements that are
initially present in the star (Fig. 5.8 ). If rotation is not
considered, the initial distribution of heavy elements is barely
modified at this metallicity.

#### 5.4.2 The origin of HE 1327-2326

The star HE 1327-2326 ( frebel05 ) is one of the most iron-poor star
with [Fe/H] @xmath and an excess of Sr compared to Fe. Red circles in
Fig. 5.9 show its surface composition, according to a recent re-analysis
(Ezzedine, priv. comm.). In particular, an overabundance of Zn was found
([Zn/Fe] @xmath ).

All possible chemical compositions one can obtain with the non-rotating
25 @xmath model at @xmath @xmath @xmath are shown by the purple area.
This area shows the range of [X/Fe] ratios one can obtain when varying
the mass cut from the final mass of the model @xmath @xmath (in this
case only the material in the stellar winds is considered) to the
remnant mass @xmath @xmath (according to the relation of maeder92 ) . We
see that whatever the mass cut, N is underproduced by more than 2 dex
and Sr by more than 1 dex.

The thick black pattern shows the [X/Fe] ratios of the fast rotating 25
@xmath model ( @xmath @xmath @xmath ). The mass cut is set to 10.5
@xmath , which is just below the H-rich envelope. No dilution with ISM
was considered. In this case, the [Sr/Fe] ratio of HE 1327-2326 can be
reproduced. The fit for light elements is also satisfactory. In
particular, N is much closer to the observed value. It is however still
underproduced by 0.5 dex. The dashed pattern, shows the yields of a
model with same metallicity and rotation but with an initial mass of 20
@xmath and a small network (model of Sect. 4.3 ). This model can produce
enough N, suggesting that a source star with a bit different initial
mass may provide a better fit (at least for the light elements).

In Sect. 4.6 , the source star model that best reproduced the abundance
pattern (for light elements, C to Si) of HE 1327-2326 was a fast
rotating 60 @xmath model without late mixing, without dilution with ISM
and with a mass cut close to the bottom of the H-envelope (cf. Table 4.5
). All these characteristics are consistent with the new results
obtained here, except for the initial mass of the source star ( @xmath
@xmath here vs. 60 @xmath before). The high [Sr/Fe] might favor rotating
@xmath 25 @xmath instead of @xmath 60 @xmath source stars because the
s-process boost induced by rotation peaks around @xmath @xmath (
choplin18 ) . A rotating 60 @xmath source star may not produce enough
Sr. In the future, the computation of additional source star models at
this low metallicity but with different initial masses may help to
further address this point.

The source star models presented here underproduce Ti, Ni and Zn by
@xmath dex. Such elements can be affected by explosive nucleosynthesis.
Interestingly, it was shown that Ti and Zn are overproduced in
jet-induced SNe ( tominaga09 ) . This kind of asymmetric SN may be
produced by fast rotation of the massive stellar core at the time of the
explosion ( woosley93 ) . Fast rotation of the core at the time of
explosion may be due to fast rotation of the progenitor. The fact that
HE 1327-2326 is enriched in both the product of rotation (e.g. N, Sr)
and of jet-induced SNe (e.g. Zn) may indicate that its source star was a
massive rotating star that experienced a jet-induced SN.

In general, the determination of the abundances of both rotation
products and jet-induced SNe products in very metal-poor stars might
give clues on the impact of rotation on the explosion. An interesting
perspective is to study these two families of elements in very
metal-poor stars. However, for some interesting elements like Zn, almost
only upper limits are available at the moment since they are very
challenging to detect.

### 5.5 Summary

By increasing the amount of available neutrons, rotation boosts the
s-process in massive stars. A new grid of non-rotating and rotating (
@xmath ) stellar models at [Fe/H] @xmath with initial masses of 10, 15,
20, 25, 40, 60, 85, 120 and 150 @xmath was computed. Stellar yields are
publicly available. Rotation has a strong impact on the production of
s-elements (especially the first peak, e.g. Sr) for initial masses
between about 20 and 60 @xmath . Two additional 25 @xmath models were
computed: one with faster rotation ( @xmath ) and another with faster
rotation ( @xmath ) and lower @xmath O( @xmath ) rate (divided by 10, it
reduces the poisoning effect of @xmath O). In these two models, the
production of s-elements is boosted again. The fast rotating model with
a lower @xmath O( @xmath ) rate is the model where the s-process boost
is the strongest. In particular, a modest amount of heavy s-elements
(e.g. Pb) is synthesized. In stellar models with initial masses @xmath
@xmath , the back-and-forth mixing is less efficient so that the
production of s-elements is similar whether or not rotation is
considered.

Some CEMP-s stars appear to be single stars, which may challenge the AGB
binary scenario (for these specific stars). The yields of the fast
rotating 25 @xmath model of the computed grid provide a material able to
fit the abundance patterns of 3 out of the 4 apparently single CEMP-s
stars.

The s-process boost induced by rotation still exists in lower
metallicity massive stellar models (probably down to about @xmath ).
HE 1327-2326, one of the most iron-poor star known, has [Sr/Fe] = 1.08.
Its abundance pattern can be reproduced by a fast rotating very low
metallicity @xmath @xmath source star. The fact that this CEMP star is
also enriched in Zn, which is a product of jet-induced SNe, is
consistent with a scenario proposing that its source star was a fast
rotator that experienced a jet-induced SN.

## Chapter 6 Conclusions and perspectives

### 6.1 Conclusions

This work mainly aimed at better understanding the nature of the early
generations of massive stars. They are crucial objects to figure out the
origin of the elements in the Universe. Although long-dead, indirect
clues on these stars can be obtained from the surface chemical
composition of still alive and observable low-mass metal-poor stars,
formed early in the Universe. Some of these low-mass metal-poor stars,
very little enriched in iron and showing highly non solar-like abundance
patterns (CEMP stars, especially CEMP-no) are thought to have formed
from the ejecta of only one or a few previous zero or very
low-metallicity massive stars (the source stars). To gain knowledge on
the characteristics of the early massive stars, I computed models of
massive source stars under various assumptions so as to determine what
are the source star ingredients required to reproduce the abundances of
CEMP stars.

Below are listed the main concrete works carried out during this PhD,
followed by the main results.

-   I developed a nucleosynthetic one-zone code mimicking the effect of
    rotation on nucleosynthesis in stellar interiors and made
    comparisons with abundances of CEMP stars (Sect. 4.2 and choplin16 )
    .

-   I computed pre-supernovae massive source star models under various
    assumptions (initial mass, rotation, extra mixing…) and made
    comparisons with abundances of CEMP stars (Sect. 4.3 , 4.4 , 4.6 and
    choplin17a ) .

-   I developed a small module in genec allowing to generate extra
    mixing events in a specific zone of a stellar model (Sect. 4.5 and
    choplin17a ) .

-   I computed a new grid of massive stars from 10 to 150 @xmath , at
    @xmath , with and without rotation and including full
    nucleosynthesis so as to follow the s-process (Sect. 5.2 and
    choplin18 ) . Stellar yields are available online ¹ ¹ 1 See
    https://www.unige.ch/sciences/astro/evolution/en/database/ or the
    CDS database at cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr . . Then, comparisons with CEMP
    stars enriched in s-elements were done (Sect. 5.3 , 5.4 and
    choplin17letter ) .

-   During a short term scientific mission with Prof. Jose Groh, I
    produced CMFGEN spectra for a population of main-sequence massive
    stars at @xmath and started to investigate the effect of fast
    rotation in the spectral features of such stars (see Sect. 6.2.1 for
    more details).

-   I included the effects of axion losses in genec and computed a grid
    of non rotating Pop III stars with and without axion losses (Sect.
    3.4 , Appendix A.1 and choplin17ax ) .

-   I included in genec the new diffusion coefficient of maeder13 that
    describes the interaction between various instabilities arising in
    rotating stars (Appendix A.2 ). I carried out several tests models
    to compare this prescription with other prescriptions (Sect. 3.3.1
    ).

-   I included in genec the new mass loss recipe of moriya15 that
    considers the mass loss induced by pulsations in the late evolution
    of very massive metal-free stars (Appendix A.3 ).

-   I improved the way of treating the rotational mixing in genec by
    upgrading the calculation techniques of the @xmath coefficient
    (Appendix A.4 ).

-   I transformed the tabulated reaction rates of best13 into the
    reaclib format (Sect. 5.2.1 ).

The main results of these works, presented in the chapters 4 and 5 , can
be summarized as follow:

-   Using the one-zone nucleosynthetic code, I found that a significant
    fraction of the CEMP stars with [Fe/H] @xmath can be overall well
    reproduced by a material processed by H-burning at a temperature and
    density characteristic of @xmath @xmath source stars. While burning,
    this material has to be enriched in @xmath C, @xmath O and
    occasionally in @xmath Ne. It suggests that the source stars
    experienced mid to strong rotational mixing.

-   Complete source star models with various initial parameters
    (especially rotation) were computed. The efficient rotational mixing
    operating at low metallicity triggers exchanges of material between
    the He-burning core and the H-burning shell. It leads to a rich and
    varied nucleosynthesis, able to cover the ranges of abundances of
    light elements for the CEMP stars with [Fe/H] @xmath 3.

-   Comparisons between source star models and observations in the [C/N]
    vs. @xmath C/ @xmath C diagram revealed some discrepancies that can
    be alleviated if a late mixing process is included in the source
    stars. The mixing operates in between the H-burning shell and the
    He-burning shell, about 200 yr before the end of the source star
    evolution. The mixing may also operate before, provided the material
    in the H-burning shell (at least some of it) is saved from further
    processing shortly after the mixing event (e.g. it is expelled
    through stellar winds).

-   The abundance fitting (for light elements, C to Si) of 69 CEMP stars
    with [Fe/H] @xmath and not significantly enriched in s- and
    r-elements was performed with @xmath ejecta composition of source
    star models. The best source stars are preferentially fast rotators
    (74 % of the cases), have initial masses of 20 @xmath (70 %) and
    experienced the late mixing process (72 %). In most of the cases (
    @xmath %), only the outer layers of the source stars (above or just
    below the interface between the H-rich and He-rich region) have to
    be expelled. Finally, the best abundance fits are mostly obtained
    with a modest dilution of the ejecta with the interstellar medium (
    @xmath times more interstellar material than source star ejecta).

-   A new grid of massive source stars at [Fe/H] @xmath was computed
    with an extended nuclear network, able to follow the full s-process
    during the evolution. Rotation was found to strongly boost the first
    s-process peak (e.g. Sr) for stars with initial masses between 20
    and 60 @xmath . If the initial rotation is high enough, models
    predict a significant synthesis of s-elements from the second peak
    (e.g. Ba). Elements from the third peak (e.g. Pb) were found to be
    little impacted by rotation.

-   CEMP-s stars, which often have @xmath [Fe/H] @xmath , are generally
    associated with the AGB binary scenario. Four CEMP-s stars were
    recently found to be single stars, a characteristic that may
    challenge this scenario. The fast rotating 25 @xmath model of the
    new grid of model including s-process provides a material able to
    fit the abundance pattern of 3 out of the 4 apparently single CEMP-s
    stars.

-   The abundances of HE 1327-2326, one of the most iron-poor star, were
    examined in detail with the yields of new very low metallicity
    source star models including the s-process. Both the excess in light
    elements and Sr can be explained with the ejecta of a fast rotating
    @xmath @xmath source star model. Interestingly, the fact that
    HE 1327-2326 is enriched in both the products of rotation (e.g. N,
    Sr) and of jet-induced supernovae (e.g. Zn), is consistent with a
    scenario proposing that its source star was a fast rotator that
    experienced a jet-induced supernova.

The results of this work suggest that rotation in the source star is a
crucial ingredient, which is able to provide a solution for the
abundances of light elements (C to Si) and s-elements of many CEMP
stars. It supports the idea that rotation was a dominant effect in the
early generations of massive stars. The results propose that in most of
the cases, a strong and late mixing event operated in between the
H-burning and He-burning shell of early massive stars. It was also shown
that CEMP stars should be formed with only the relatively outer layers
of the source stars (generally only the H-envelope or the H-envelope
plus a small part of the He-rich region). This suggests that early
massive stars expelled only their envelope and experienced strong
fallback. The present work does not offer a specific mechanism for the
ejection of the source star envelope. Although stellar wind is a good
candidate for the reasons mentioned in Sect. 3.3.5 , the wind material
of the source star models presented here is generally not sufficiently
enriched in light and heavy elements for reproducing the CEMP star
abundances. An additional (generally modest) supernova contribution is
required. In any case, the fact that just the envelope of the source
star should be expelled is consistent with the mixing & fallback
scenario that could finally co-exist with the fast rotating massive star
scenario.

### 6.2 Perspectives

The nature of the first stars is a topic where we are still scratching
the surface and where to move on, modelers and observers should go hands
in hands. Below are important possible future steps or projects (mainly
on the modeling side) linked to the present work.

-   The modeling of grids of source star models including s-process has
    to be continued, especially at very low metallicity. The aim is to
    get a more complete picture of the nucleosynthesis in rotating
    massive stars and perform extended comparisons with observations,
    with as much abundances as possible.

-   The new scenario for the origin of HE 1327-2326 raises the interest
    for studying the outputs of rotating massive stars experiencing a
    jet-induced supernova. A consistent prediction of the
    nucleosynthetic yields of a rotating massive star ending its life as
    a jet SN could be an interesting project. In the future, the
    comparison of such models with observations might give clues on how
    the explosion of early massive stars can be affected by rotation.

-   Although generally operating in very central regions, which may be
    finally locked into the remnant, the SN-shock may lead to further
    neutron capture nucleosynthesis in the He-shell. It could be
    included in source star models.

-   The late mixing process could be studied using multi dimension
    models. Also, when available, constraints from such multi dimension
    models (especially on the convective boundaries of the H- and
    He-burning shells) should be included in 1D stellar evolution codes
    so as to further test the hypothesis of the late mixing process in
    the source stars.

-   An important project would be to recover the initial surface
    composition of evolved CEMP stars by computing grids of CEMP star
    models including various mixing processes. To date, such a work on a
    large CEMP star sample has been done only for correcting effect of
    the first dredge-up on the C abundance ( placco14c ) . Knowing well
    the initial surface composition of CEMP stars (especially for the
    most evolved CEMP stars) is crucial to connect them more
    consistently to their source stars.

There are also different observational perspectives. One may be to try
determining the abundances of both rotation and jet-induced SN products
on the most metal poor stars (cf. point 2 just above). Isotopic ratios
(especially @xmath C/ @xmath C) are very constraining (especially on
rather unevolved stars) and can provide strong clues on nucleosynthetic
processes at work in source stars. Also, the oxygen is likely
overproduced in massive stars compared to AGB stars ( choplin17letter )
and might help to further assess the relative contribution of these
sources (particularly in the case of the apparently single CEMP-s stars,
cf. Sect. 5.3 ). As first proposed in meynet10 , this work predicts that
some CEMP stars are enriched in helium (Sect. 4.7 ). Detecting helium in
CEMP stars is probably very challenging but it may be mentioned here as
a possible observational perspective. Generally, an observation campaign
able to determine rather complete abundance patterns (as for
HE 1045+0226 and CS 30301-015, cf. Sect. 5.3 ) will help very much in
choosing between the different existing models. Also, although probably
tedious and challenging, radial velocity measurements of more CEMP stars
over a long period of time would be very interesting ( hansen16b ;
hansen16a , did such measurements for 22 CEMP-s and 24 CEMP-no stars)
and would help better understanding their origin.

#### 6.2.1 Linking the old and local with the old and distant Universe

To gain knowledge on the first generation of massive stars, the present
work focused on their signatures in the local Universe. As mentioned in
the introduction (Sect. 1.4 ), an alternative way is to observe the
distant Universe: either individual explosive/transient events or the
integrated light of high redshift galaxies. An interesting project would
be to predict the specific signatures in the high redshift Universe of
the CEMP massive source stars. It will establish a connection between
the old and local Universe with the old and distant Universe. A
schematic view of such a project is shown in Fig. 6.1 : the source star
population that best account for observations of metal-poor stars is
determined using stellar models (the aim of the present thesis, for CEMP
stars) and also Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models. GCE models are
suitable to investigate the origin of normal metal-poor stars, which
probably formed from a reservoir well enriched by different previous
sources and not just @xmath source star. Type of supernovae, supernova
rates, and emergent spectrum of this massive source star population may
be estimated combining the outputs of stellar evolution modeling, GCE
modeling and the predictions from a radiative transfer code. Such
predictions could be compared to high redshift observations, especially
observations from JWST, that may be able to catch the explosion of the
first generations of massive stars ( whalen13c ; whalen13a ; whalen13b )
.

During a Short Term Scientific Mission ² ² 2 STSM, in the frame of the
COST action ChETEC ( http://www.chetec.eu/ ). of two weeks with Pr. Jose
Groh (Trinity college, Dublin), we started to work on one aspect of this
project. As a very first step, I tried to see what would be the emergent
spectrum of a population of main sequence fast rotating massive source
stars compared to a population of main sequence non-rotating massive
source stars. I extended the small grid of massive stars presented in
Sect. 4.5 . In addition to the 20, 32 and 60 @xmath models, I computed
10, 12, 15, 25, 85 and 120 @xmath models. The initial rotation is either
0 or 70 % of the critical velocity. Only the main sequence was computed.
To compute the output spectra of the models, the atmospheric radiative
transfer code CMFGEN ( hillier98 ) is used. CMFGEN is a
spherically-symmetric code that computes line and continuum formation in
non-local thermodynamical equilibrium. Fig 6.2 shows the emergent
spectra of the non-rotating models at the middle of the main sequence (H
in the core is half burnt). Also the integrated spectrum is shown by the
dashed line. After normalizing the spectra with their continuum,
comparisons can be done with the rotating population. A detailed
comparison of specific lines (e.g. HeI @xmath 6680 or HeII @xmath 4687)
between the different models remains to be done.

In the future, after the analysis of these first results, it would be
worth computing a more realistic emergent integrated spectrum by
calculating more CMFGEN spectra (at different stages of the main
sequence but also after the main sequence), by considering a
non-constant star formation rate (e.g. a burst of star formation), by
maybe considering additional rotational velocities, by introducing some
noise and convolving the spectra with a Gaussian (corresponding to a
given spectral resolution) so as to predict which kind of observing
facility may be able to detect a given spectral feature predicted by the
models.

  -- -------- -- -------

@xmath is the reduced planck constant, @xmath the speed of light and
@xmath the Boltzmann constant. The Debye–Hückel screening wavenumber
@xmath , is given by raffelt08 as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the fine structure constant, @xmath the atomic number
and @xmath the ions/electron number densities. The term @xmath in Eq.
A.1 is equal to @xmath with @xmath the plasma frequency defined as

  -- -- -- -------
           (A.5)
  -- -- -- -------

In genec , I have included the energy loss by axions @xmath by adding it
to @xmath , the energy loss by neutrino. Axion losses are considered if
the parameter iaxions=1 . When solving the stellar structure equations
with the Henyey method, the derivatives of @xmath and @xmath as a
function of @xmath and @xmath are required for convergence. Most of the
time, @xmath , so that @xmath can be neglected. At the end of He-burning
however, axion losses become the dominant source of energy loss and must
be included in the energy derivatives. In the case of genec , the
following terms have to be evaluated:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath . The term on the left in A.6 can be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

The derivative of @xmath as a function of @xmath is equal to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

At this point, the derivatives of @xmath and @xmath have to be
calculated:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

The derivatives of @xmath and @xmath as a function of @xmath are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

with

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

since @xmath . The derivative of @xmath in Eq. A.8 is non-zero because
@xmath . It yields

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

A similar derivation has to be done for the second term of A.6 . Then,
@xmath has to be derived as a function of @xmath (with @xmath constant
but not @xmath , so that @xmath has to be derived as a function of
@xmath ). It yields

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

The derivative of @xmath as a function of @xmath is evaluated similarly
to Eq. A.9 , A.10 and A.11 . Then, as in Eq. A.12 , one needs the
derivative of @xmath but this time as a function of @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

Finally, the derivative of @xmath as a function of @xmath is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

From this point, all quantities are defined or available in the code so
that Eq. A.8 and A.14 can be calculated and the two quantities in A.6
evaluated.

### a.2 Secular shear mixing

The @xmath used in this work is the one of talon97 . The other @xmath
coefficient from maeder97 can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath the fraction of the excess energy in the shear that
contributes to mixing. It is generally calibrated on observations (cf.
Sect. 3.3.1 ).

It also exists other instabilities (e.g. thermohaline instability…)
that, when included in 1D stellar evolution codes, are generally
translated as individual diffusion coefficients. The global diffusion
coefficient is then expressed as the sum of the coefficients of the
various effects considered independently. However, it can exist physical
interactions between the different instabilities, possibly leading to
amplification or damping effects. maeder13 have proposed a global
stability criterion, taking into account different instabilities
together (thermohaline instability, shear instability, Rayleigh-Taylor
instability, semiconvective instability, the instability characterized
by the Solberg-Høiland criterion and the baroclinic instability). From
the stability criterium, I have derived the global diffusion coefficient
and included it genec . The global stability criterium is written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

with

@xmath

@xmath

@xmath

and where

@xmath

@xmath

@xmath

with @xmath the distance to the rotational axis. It can be written
@xmath where @xmath is the colatitude. @xmath can be expressed as @xmath
. Let us express the first term of @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

It yields

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

In numerical calculations, one has to average @xmath over an isobar. We
obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

The diffusion coefficient is @xmath where @xmath are the two solutions
of Eq. A.18 . Test models were computed with both solutions. The first
solution leads to convergence issues while the second does not. The
second one also gives plausible results (Fig. 3.5 ). In genec , the
second solution was implemented as a standard choice.

### a.3 Mass loss recipes

The pulsationally induced mass-loss rate derived by moriya15 are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is expressed in @xmath yr @xmath and with @xmath . In genec
, this mass loss is considered and added to other kinds of mass losses
(mechanical, radiative) if the parameter ipuls=1 and if @xmath (it
corresponds to @xmath K). This is the temperature below which the
stellar envelope becomes pulsationally unstable ( moriya15 ) . The
parameter @xmath is a free parameter that has to be chosen between the 4
possible values (0.1, 0.3, 0.5 or 0.8, parameter epsil in the code).

A small change was also done in the mass loss recipe of jager88 in order
to correct a bug happening for very luminous stars. In the expression of
@xmath , there is a term

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a function defined as @xmath . This definition implies
that the term in brackets in Eq. A.23 must be @xmath or equivalently,
@xmath . In extreme cases (e.g. very massive stars), it happens that
this condition is not verified, leading to convergence issues. To solve
this issue, I just took the minimum between 1 and the bracket value in
Eq. A.23 .

### a.4 Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing

In genec , a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing technique can be
used for smoothing the profile of a quantity (e.g. @xmath or @xmath )
when calculating its derivative. It is used at least during the main
sequence of rotating models to smooth the @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
(vertical component of the meridional circulation) profiles. Without it,
the code may experience convergence issues.

Fig. A.1 illustrates the technique. Let us consider @xmath data points
with given coordinates @xmath and @xmath (black crosses in Fig. A.1 ,
upper panels). Let us focus on the point at @xmath in the upper left
panel of Fig. A.1 . A window of @xmath points around that point is
selected. @xmath is a parameter to chose. In this example, @xmath so
that @xmath . A linear fit with these @xmath points is then performed
and the derivative is taken equal to the slope of the fit. Fig. A.1
(lower left) shows @xmath , the derivative of the data when considering
just the two neighborhood values (black line) and the derivative if
smoothing is done (red line). The smoothed data being more regular, the
red profile is less sharp.

The size of the window @xmath used to smooth the profile plays an
important role. The upper right panel of Fig. A.1 shows the same data as
well as the three smoothed profiles for @xmath (blue), @xmath and @xmath
(green). The larger the size of the window, the more damped the
irregularity of the raw profile, because the fit is done using more
points. It leads to smoother derivatives (Fig. A.1 , lower right panel).
This smoothing technique can be seen as a filter that damps the
irregularity of the @xmath profile. If @xmath is small, the smoothing is
weak (i.e. close to the raw data), if @xmath is large, some important
(physical) features in the profile can be lost.

The effect of varying @xmath in a complete stellar model is shown in
Fig. A.2 . The @xmath gradient calculated from just the two neighborhood
values (pink line) presents strong oscillations which are likely not
physical. The smoothing procedure described previously damps these
features (other lines).

In genec , I introduced a mesh-adaptative @xmath parameter, defined as
@xmath with @xmath the mesh number and @xmath , a constant selected
after carrying numerical tests with various values of @xmath .

### a.5 S-process parameters

I remind here some quantities that can be used to quantify the
efficiency of the s-process. These quantities are tabulated in Table A.1
for the grid of models published in choplin18 . These quantities may be
useful for future comparisons with other models.

The central neutron exposure during core He-burning @xmath is defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are the age of the model at the beginning and
the end of the core He-burning phase, respectively, @xmath the neutron
density and @xmath the thermal velocity (with @xmath keV as a typical
value in the helium burning core). Because the neutron density @xmath
varies with time and mass coordinate in the model, it is interesting to
define the neutron exposure averaged over the He-core and over the
He-burning lifetime:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

@xmath is the neutron density at time @xmath averaged over the He-core.
It is defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the mass of the helium core at time @xmath and @xmath
the neutron density at coordinate @xmath . Finally, the average number
of neutron captures per iron seed @xmath is defined as ( kappeler90 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath and @xmath the final and initial number abundance of a
nucleus with nuclear mass number A and @xmath ( @xmath Fe) the initial
number abundance of @xmath Fe.
