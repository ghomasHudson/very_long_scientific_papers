##### Theorem 3.6.

Let

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

where @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath . Then @xmath is invariant under @xmath for all @xmath .

###### Proof.

By Proposition 3.5 it suffices to show that @xmath maps @xmath into
@xmath . We shall first deal with the operator @xmath . Consider the
states of the form @xmath , with @xmath . Since

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Calling

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

from Eqs. ( 3.13 ) and ( 3.20 ) we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

Similarly, if @xmath , the identity

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

implies that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and therefore

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (3.24)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

belongs to @xmath on account of Eqs. ( 3.11a ) and ( 3.14 ). On the
other hand, from the equality

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

it follows that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Setting

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

and using again Eqs. ( 3.13 ) and ( 3.20 ) we then have

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (3.26)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath , the RHS of Eq. ( 3.26 ) belongs to @xmath if and only if
@xmath . The last type of states generating the module @xmath are of the
form @xmath , where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

From the equality

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

it follows that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using again Eqs. ( 3.13 ) and ( 3.20 ) we obtain

  -- -- -- --------
           (3.29)
  -- -- -- --------

Since @xmath , the RHS of the latter equation clearly belongs to @xmath
. This shows that @xmath .

Consider next the action of the operator @xmath on a state of the form
@xmath , with @xmath . From the identity

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we easily obtain

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and therefore, by Eqs. ( 3.11b ), ( 3.15 ) and ( 3.16 ),

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

Thus @xmath , as claimed.

Consider, finally, the operator @xmath . If @xmath , the identity

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

yields

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and hence, by Eq. ( 3.17 ),

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (3.31)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

clearly belongs to @xmath on account of Eqs. ( 3.11c ) and ( 3.18 ). The
last type of spin states we need to study are of the form @xmath , where
@xmath with @xmath . Since

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we obtain

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and thus, by Eqs. ( 3.17 ) and ( 3.20 ),

  -- -- -- --------
           (3.32)
  -- -- -- --------

From Eqs. ( 3.11c ) and ( 3.18 ), it follows that the RHS of the
previous equation belongs to @xmath . Hence @xmath , which concludes the
proof. ∎

###### Remark 3.7.

We have chosen to allow a certain overlap between the different types of
states spanning the spaces @xmath . For instance, if @xmath is symmetric
a state @xmath is also of the form @xmath . Less trivially, in the case
of spin @xmath the identity

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath and @xmath are respectively defined in Eqs. ( 3.22 ) and (
3.27 ), implies that the states of the form @xmath in the space @xmath
can be expressed in terms of the other generators of this space.

###### Corollary 3.8.

For each @xmath , the gauge Hamiltonian @xmath leaves invariant the
space @xmath defined by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

We shall begin by showing that each space @xmath is invariant under the
operator @xmath . Note first that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the states @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are defined in Eqs. ( 3.22
), ( 3.25 ) and ( 3.27 ), respectively. Using Eqs. ( 3.13 ), ( 3.15 )
and ( 3.17 ) one can immediately establish the identities

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.34a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.34b)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.34c)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

From Eqs. ( 3.33 )-( 3.34 ) and the fact that @xmath is a derivation it
follows that @xmath leaves invariant the spaces @xmath for all @xmath .
This implies that @xmath preserves @xmath for @xmath , since the
coefficient @xmath vanishes in these cases (cf. Table 3.1 ). On the
other hand, for @xmath the coefficient @xmath is nonzero, and thus we
have to consider the action of the operator @xmath on the space @xmath .
We now have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

and, from Eq. ( 3.15 ),

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

Hence @xmath leaves invariant the subspace @xmath of @xmath defined by
the restrictions @xmath . From the obvious identity @xmath and Eq. (
3.30 ), together with ( 3.11b ), ( 3.12 ) and ( 3.16 ), it follows that
the operator @xmath also preserves @xmath . Likewise, Eqs. ( 3.33 )
and ( 3.34b ) imply that @xmath is invariant under @xmath , and hence
under the gauge Hamiltonian @xmath . ∎

Theorem 3.6 characterizes the invariant space @xmath in terms of the
subspace @xmath in Eq. ( 3.21 ) that we shall now study in detail. In
fact, from the definition of the invariant space @xmath it follows that
we can consider without loss of generality the quotient space @xmath ,
where @xmath if @xmath . For instance, from Eq. ( 3.19 ) it immediately
follows that if @xmath and @xmath is a permutation such that @xmath for
@xmath , then @xmath belongs to @xmath and is equivalent to @xmath .

In the rest of this section, we shall denote @xmath simply as @xmath for
the sake of conciseness. From Eq. ( 3.19 ) it easily follows that any
symmetric state belongs to @xmath , since

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

On the other hand, if @xmath the corresponding state @xmath is a trivial
(factorized) state. We shall next show that the reciprocal of this
statement is also true, up to equivalence.

###### Lemma 3.9.

For every @xmath , @xmath is a factorized state if and only if @xmath .

###### Proof.

Suppose that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is a factorized state. Since the LHS of the previous formula is
symmetric, @xmath for all @xmath and @xmath . By absorbing the constant
@xmath into @xmath we can take @xmath without loss of generality, and
therefore

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

From Eq. ( 3.20 ) with @xmath it then follows that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Setting @xmath and using the previous identity we obtain

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Hence @xmath , as claimed. ∎

By the previous lemma, it suffices to characterize the nonsymmetric
states in @xmath . To this end, let us introduce the linear operator
@xmath by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

Given an element @xmath of the canonical basis of @xmath , we shall also
denote by @xmath the set of distinct components of @xmath , and by
@xmath the number of times that @xmath appears among the components of
@xmath . For instance, if @xmath , then we can take @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath , so that @xmath , @xmath . Consider the spin states @xmath ,
@xmath , given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
                                   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.39a)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.39b)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

Here we have adopted the following convention: an ellipsis inside a ket
stands for an arbitrary ordering of the components in @xmath not
indicated explicitly. Note that the states ( 3.39 ) are defined only up
to equivalence, and that @xmath for any permutation @xmath .

###### Proposition 3.10.

Given a basic spin state @xmath , the associated spin states @xmath are
all in @xmath .

###### Proof.

Consider first a state @xmath of the type ( 3.39a ). Using the
definition of the operator @xmath in Eq. ( 3.38 ) we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the permutations @xmath act only on the @xmath spin components
specified by an ellipsis. On the other hand, we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

Comparing Eqs. ( 3.40 ) and ( 3.41 ) we obtain

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (3.42)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

This shows that any state of the form ( 3.39a ) belongs to @xmath .
Suppose next that @xmath , so that @xmath is given by Eq. ( 3.39b ).
Since

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

it follows that in this case @xmath is also in @xmath . ∎

###### Remark 3.11.

Just as symmetric spin states, cf. Eq. ( 3.37 ), the states @xmath
satisfy the relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

Indeed, if @xmath , from Eqs. ( 3.39a ) and ( 3.42 ) we have

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

On the other hand, if @xmath Eqs. ( 3.39b ) and ( 3.43 ) imply that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Example 3.12.

We shall now present all the states of the form ( 3.39 ) for spin @xmath
. In this case, up to a permutation the basic state @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

If @xmath is either @xmath or @xmath , then @xmath and thus @xmath is of
the type ( 3.39a ) and proportional to @xmath . If @xmath , then @xmath
and we can take (dropping inessential factors)

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

Although the states @xmath and @xmath are linearly independent, the
combination @xmath is equivalent to a symmetric state. In the case
@xmath the states @xmath are obtained from the previous ones by flipping
the spins. Finally, if @xmath then @xmath and the states @xmath are now
given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

According to the previous example, for spin @xmath there are exactly
@xmath independent states of the form ( 3.39 ) associated with each
basic state @xmath , up to symmetric states. We shall see next that this
fact actually holds for arbitrary spin:

###### Proposition 3.13.

Let @xmath be a basic spin state. If @xmath is the number of distinct
components of @xmath , there are exactly @xmath independent states of
the form ( 3.39 ) modulo symmetric states.

###### Proof.

Let @xmath be the number of distinct components @xmath of @xmath such
that @xmath . A straightforward computation shows that the combination

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

is equivalent to a symmetric state. Suppose first that @xmath . It is
immediate to check that in this case the set @xmath is linearly
independent. If a linear combination @xmath is equivalent to a symmetric
state @xmath , then @xmath must be proportional to @xmath , so that we
can write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Hence @xmath , and the linear independence of the states @xmath implies
that @xmath for all @xmath . On the other hand, if @xmath the set @xmath
is linearly dependent on account of Eq. ( 3.47 ), but removing one of
the two states with @xmath clearly yields a linearly independent set. It
is also obvious from the coefficients of the states @xmath that no
linear combination @xmath can be equivalent to a nonzero symmetric
state. ∎

The next natural question to be addressed is whether the states of the
form ( 3.39 ) span the space @xmath up to symmetric states:

###### Proposition 3.14.

The space @xmath is spanned by states of the form ( 3.39 ).

###### Proof.

For conciseness, we present the proof of this result only for the case
@xmath . Let @xmath denote the subspace of @xmath spanned by basic spin
states with @xmath “ @xmath ” spins, and set @xmath . Since the
operators @xmath and @xmath involved in the definition ( 3.21 ) of
@xmath clearly preserve @xmath , it suffices to show that the states
@xmath with @xmath given by ( 3.45 ) span the space @xmath up to
symmetric states. Note first that the statement is trivial for @xmath ,
since in this case the states of the form ( 3.39 ) obviously generate
the whole space @xmath . Suppose, therefore, that @xmath , so that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since the state ( 3.46 ) and the symmetric state (up to equivalence)

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

both belong to @xmath , we need only show that (for instance) @xmath is
not in @xmath , i.e., that @xmath is not symmetric. But this is
certainly the case, since a state of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

appears in @xmath with coefficient @xmath depending on @xmath . ∎

### 3.4 The algebraic eigenfunctions

In the previous section we have provided a detailed description of the
spaces @xmath invariant under the corresponding gauge Hamiltonian @xmath
. In this section we shall explicitly compute all the eigenfunctions of
the restrictions of the operators @xmath to their invariant spaces
@xmath . This yields several infinite ¹ ¹ 1 For the model ( 3.2c ) we
shall see below that the number of eigenfunctions with a given total
momentum is finite. families of eigenfunctions for each of the models (
3.2 ), which is the main result of this paper. We shall use the term
algebraic to refer to these eigenfunctions and their corresponding
energies. It is important to observe that the eigenfunctions of the
gauge Hamiltonian @xmath that can be constructed in this way are
necessarily invariant under the whole symmetric group, in spite of the
fact that @xmath is symmetric only under cyclic permutations. In fact,
the explicit solutions of all known CS models with near-neighbors
interactions (both in the scalar and spin cases) can be factorized as
the product of a simple gauge factor analogous to @xmath times a
completely symmetric function [ 124 , 10 , 48 , 75 ] . This, however,
does not rule out the existence of other eigenfunctions of the gauge
Hamiltonian @xmath invariant only under the subgroup of cyclic
permutations, which is indeed an interesting open problem.

#### Case a

We shall begin with the model ( 3.2a ), which is probably the most
interesting one due to the rich structure of its associated invariant
flag. In order to find the algebraic energies of the model, note first
that one can clearly construct a basis @xmath of @xmath whose elements
are homogeneous polynomials in @xmath with coefficients in @xmath . If
@xmath has degree @xmath , then @xmath and @xmath has degree at most
@xmath . If @xmath is ordered according to the degree, the operator
@xmath is represented in this basis by a triangular matrix with diagonal
elements @xmath , where @xmath is the degree. Thus the algebraic
eigenfunctions are the numbers

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We shall next show that the algebraic eigenfunctions of @xmath can be
expressed in closed form in terms of generalized Laguerre and Jacobi
polynomials. The computation is basically a two-step procedure. In the
first place, one encodes the eigenvalue problem in the invariant space
@xmath as a system of linear partial differential equations. The second
step then consists in finding the polynomial solutions of this system.

Regarding the first step, we shall need the following preliminary lemma:

###### Lemma 3.15.

The operator @xmath preserves the following subspaces of @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.48)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.49)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.50)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath are as in the
definition of @xmath in Theorem 3.6 , and @xmath , @xmath , @xmath are
respectively given by ( 3.22 ), ( 3.25 ) and ( 3.27 ).

###### Proof.

The identity @xmath and Eqs. ( 3.23 ), ( 3.24 ) and ( 3.33 ) clearly
imply that the subspace @xmath is invariant under @xmath . Consider next
the action of @xmath on a function of the form @xmath . Since @xmath is
symmetric under @xmath , we can replace @xmath by @xmath in Eq. ( 3.26
). Secondly, any state @xmath satisfies the identity

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

Indeed, we already know that the previous identity holds for symmetric
states (cf. Eq. ( 3.37 )) and for states of the form ( 3.39 )
(cf. Eqs. ( 3.38 ) and ( 3.44 )). On the other hand, by Proposition 3.14
every state in @xmath is a linear combination of a symmetric state,
states of the form ( 3.39 ), and a state @xmath such that @xmath . But
for the latter “null” state @xmath for all @xmath , and hence @xmath .
Therefore, Eq. ( 3.26 ) can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

From the previous equation and Eq. ( 3.33 ) it follows that @xmath .
Finally, if @xmath , Eq. ( 3.29 ) reduces to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

which, together with Eq. ( 3.33 ), implies that @xmath . ∎

###### Remark 3.16.

The requirement that @xmath be symmetric (respectively antisymmetric)
under @xmath in the definition of the space @xmath (respectively @xmath
) is no real restriction, since the antisymmetric (respectively
symmetric) part of @xmath does not contribute to the state @xmath
(respectively @xmath ).

By the previous lemma, we can consider without loss of generality
eigenfunctions of @xmath of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the spin functions @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are all built from
the same spin state @xmath . Note that we can assume that @xmath , and
that the spin state @xmath is symmetric under @xmath and belongs to
@xmath if @xmath , whereas it is antisymmetric under @xmath if @xmath .

Using Eqs. ( 3.23 ), ( 3.24 ), ( 3.33 ), ( 3.52 ) and ( 3.53 ), it is
straightforward to show that the eigenvalue equation @xmath is
equivalent to the system

  -- -------- -- ---------
                 
     @xmath      (3.55a)
     @xmath      (3.55b)
     @xmath      (3.55c)
     @xmath      (3.55d)
     @xmath      (3.55e)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Since @xmath and @xmath are linear in @xmath , we can write

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are polynomials in @xmath and
@xmath . Taking into account that the action of @xmath on scalar
symmetric functions is given by the RHS of Eq. ( 3.12 ) with @xmath ,
and using Eqs. ( 3.11a ), ( 3.14 ) and ( 3.34a ), we finally obtain the
following linear system of PDEs:

  -- -------- -- ---------
                 
     @xmath      (3.57a)
     @xmath      (3.57b)
     @xmath      (3.57c)
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (3.57d)
     @xmath      (3.57e)
     @xmath      (3.57f)
     @xmath      (3.57g)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

As a consequence of the general discussion of the previous Section, the
latter system is guaranteed to possess polynomials solutions. In fact,
these polynomial solutions can be expressed in closed form in terms of
generalized Laguerre polynomials @xmath and Jacobi polynomials @xmath .

###### Theorem 3.17.

Let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the center of mass coordinate. The Hamiltonian @xmath
possesses the following families of spin eigenfunctions with eigenvalue
@xmath , with @xmath and @xmath as indicated in each case:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath            
              @xmath   
     @xmath            
                       
     @xmath            
     @xmath            
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
     @xmath            
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

Here

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the spin state @xmath is symmetric under @xmath and belongs to
@xmath for the eigenfunction @xmath , and is antisymmetric under @xmath
for the eigenfunction @xmath . The functions @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
are polynomials given explicitly by

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

for even @xmath , and

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

for odd @xmath . For every @xmath , the above eigenfunctions with @xmath
span the whole @xmath -invariant space @xmath .

###### Proof.

Recall, to begin with, that the algebraic eigenfunctions of @xmath are
of the form @xmath , with @xmath given in Table 3.1 and @xmath an
eigenfunction of @xmath of the form ( 3.54 )-( 3.56 ). In order to
determine @xmath , we must find the most general polynomial solution of
the inhomogeneous linear system ( 3.57 ). From the structure of this
system it follows that there are seven types of independent solutions,
characterized by the vanishing of certain subsets of the unknown
functions @xmath . These types are listed in Table 3.2 , where in the
last column we have indicated the eigenfunction of @xmath obtained from
each case.

We shall present here in detail the solution of the system ( 3.57 ) for
the case @xmath and @xmath , which yields the eigenfunctions of the form
@xmath (the procedure for the other cases is essentially the same). In
this case the system ( 3.57 ) reduces to

  -- -- -- --------
           (3.59)
  -- -- -- --------

Let us begin with the homogeneous equation for @xmath . We shall look
for polynomial solutions of this equation of the form @xmath , where
@xmath is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath in @xmath and @xmath
is a polynomial of degree @xmath in @xmath , so that @xmath by Eq. (
3.54 ). From Eq. ( 3.58 ) and the homogeneity of @xmath we have

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

Hence the equation for @xmath can be written as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath . Since @xmath is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath
in @xmath , both sides of the latter equation must vanish separately. We
are thus led to the following decoupled equations for @xmath and @xmath
:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.60)
     @xmath      (3.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

In terms of the variable @xmath , Eq. ( 3.61 ) can be written as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.62)
  -- -------- -- --------

is the generalized Laguerre operator. Hence @xmath is proportional to
the generalized Laguerre polynomial @xmath . On the other hand, we can
write @xmath where @xmath is a polynomial in the homogeneous variable
@xmath . With this substitution, Eq. ( 3.60 ) becomes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the Jacobi operator @xmath is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus @xmath is proportional to the Jacobi polynomial @xmath , so that we
can take

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.63)
  -- -------- -- --------

We must next find a particular solution of the inhomogeneous equation
for @xmath in ( 3.59 ), since the general solution of the corresponding
homogeneous equation yields an eigenfunction of the simpler type @xmath
. Since

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

(where the dot denotes derivative with respect to @xmath ), we make the
ansatz @xmath , where @xmath is a homogeneous polynomial of degree
@xmath in @xmath and @xmath is a polynomial of degree @xmath in @xmath .
Substituting this ansatz into the second equation in ( 3.59 ) and
proceeding as before we immediately obtain

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If we set @xmath the second term of the LHS vanishes, and canceling the
common factor @xmath we are left with the following equation for @xmath
:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The form of the RHS of this equation suggests the ansatz @xmath , with
@xmath a polynomial in the variable @xmath . The previous equation then
yields

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

From the definition of the Jacobi operator we easily obtain

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which implies that @xmath is a particular solution of Eq. ( 3.64 ).
Hence

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.65)
  -- -------- -- --------

is a particular solution of the inhomogeneous equation in ( 3.59 ). We
have thus shown that @xmath , with @xmath and @xmath respectively given
by Eqs. ( 3.63 ) and ( 3.65 ), is an eigenfunction of @xmath with
eigenvalue @xmath . Multiplying @xmath by the gauge factor @xmath we
obtain the eigenfunction @xmath of @xmath in the statement.

It remains to show that the states @xmath ( @xmath ), @xmath and @xmath
with @xmath generate the spaces ( 3.48 )–( 3.50 ). Consider first the
“monomials” of the form @xmath , which belong to @xmath if @xmath . We
can order such monomials as follows: we say that @xmath if @xmath , or
@xmath and @xmath . From the expansion [ 96 , Eq. 8.962.1]

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the Pochhammer symbol

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

it follows that @xmath provided that @xmath and @xmath . In particular,
@xmath since

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Hence we can write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath , so that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Likewise, a similar argument shows that for @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and therefore

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proceeding in the same way with the remaining spin eigenfunctions we can
finally show that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

as claimed. ∎

#### Case b

Since @xmath in this case, reasoning as before we conclude that the
algebraic energies are the numbers

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the degree in @xmath of the corresponding eigenfunctions
of @xmath . We shall see below that these eigenfunctions can be written
in terms of generalized Laguerre polynomials. To this end, we begin by
identifying certain subspaces of @xmath invariant under @xmath .

###### Lemma 3.18.

For any given spin state @xmath , the operator @xmath preserves the
subspace

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are polynomials of degrees at most @xmath and
@xmath in @xmath , respectively, and @xmath is given by ( 3.22 ).

###### Proof.

The statement follows from the obvious identity @xmath and Eqs. ( 3.11b
), ( 3.12 ), ( 3.16 ), ( 3.30 ), ( 3.33 ) and ( 3.35 ). ∎

By the previous lemma we can assume that the eigenfunctions of @xmath in
@xmath are of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

From Eqs. ( 3.30 ), ( 3.33 ) and ( 3.35 ) it easily follows that the
eigenvalue equation @xmath can be cast into the system

  -- -------- -- ---------
                 
     @xmath      (3.68a)
     @xmath      (3.68b)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Since @xmath is linear in @xmath (cf. Eq. ( 3.66 )), we can write

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.69)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are polynomials in @xmath . Using Eqs. ( 3.11b
), ( 3.12 ), ( 3.16 ), ( 3.34b ) and ( 3.36 ) we can easily rewrite the
system ( 3.68 ) as follows:

  -- -------- -- ---------
                 
     @xmath      (3.70a)
     @xmath      (3.70b)
     @xmath      (3.70c)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.71)
  -- -------- -- --------

The last step is to construct the polynomials solutions of the system (
3.70 ), which can be expressed in terms of generalized Laguerre
polynomials, according to the following theorem.

###### Theorem 3.19.

The Hamiltonian @xmath possesses the following families of spin
eigenfunctions with eigenvalue @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

where @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath , with @xmath and @xmath . For each
@xmath and @xmath , the above eigenfunctions with @xmath span the whole
@xmath -invariant space @xmath .

###### Proof.

As in the previous case, the algebraic eigenfunctions of @xmath are of
the form @xmath , where @xmath is given in Table 3.1 and @xmath is an
eigenfunction of @xmath of the form ( 3.67 )-( 3.69 ). The functions
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath are polynomials in @xmath determined by the
system ( 3.70 ), which in terms of the variable @xmath can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.72)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the generalized Laguerre operator (cf. Eq. ( 3.62 )).
The general polynomial solutions of the first two equations in ( 3.72 )
are respectively given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.73)
  -- -------- -- --------

On the other hand, from the elementary identity

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

it follows that the general polynomial solution of the third equation
in ( 3.72 ) is given by

  -- -- -- --------
           (3.74)
  -- -- -- --------

Equations ( 3.73 ) and ( 3.74 ) immediately yield the formulas of the
eigenfunctions in this case. The last assertion in the statement of the
theorem follows from the fact that the functions @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath in Eqs. ( 3.73 ) and ( 3.74 ) are the most general polynomial
solution of the system ( 3.72 ). ∎

###### Remark 3.20.

It should be noted that for @xmath the potentials ( 3.2a ) and ( 3.2b )
scale as @xmath under dilations of the coordinates (as is the case for
the original Calogero model). The standard argument used in the solution
of the Calogero model shows that there is a basis of eigenfunctions of
these models of the form @xmath , where @xmath is a homogeneous
spin-valued function. The eigenfunctions presented in Theorems 3.17 and
3.19 are indeed of this form.

#### Case c

In this case the number of independent algebraic eigenfunctions is
essentially finite. We shall take, for definiteness, the plus sign in
the change of variable listed in Table 3.1 (it will be apparent from the
discussion that follows that the minus sign does not yield additional
solutions).

Let us first note that the potential for this model is translationally
invariant, so that the total momentum operator @xmath commutes with the
Hamiltonian @xmath . Hence the eigenfunctions of @xmath can be assumed
to have well-defined total momentum. Equivalently, since

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.75)
  -- -------- -- --------

the eigenfunctions of @xmath can be assumed to be homogeneous in @xmath
. Let @xmath be a homogeneous eigenfunction of @xmath of degree @xmath
and eigenvalue @xmath , so that @xmath is an eigenfunction of @xmath
with total momentum @xmath (cf. Eq. ( 3.75 )) and energy @xmath . By
Eq. ( 3.75 ), the function @xmath clearly has total momentum @xmath . In
fact, the following lemma implies that @xmath is also an eigenfunction
of @xmath with a suitably boosted energy:

###### Lemma 3.21.

Let @xmath be a homogeneous eigenfunction of @xmath of degree @xmath and
eigenvalue @xmath . Then @xmath is an eigenfunction of @xmath with
eigenvalue @xmath .

###### Proof.

From the identity

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath , we immediately obtain the following expression for the
gauge Hamiltonian @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.76)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath for any real @xmath , it follows that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Taking into account that @xmath , we conclude that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

as claimed. ∎

By the previous discussion, in what follows any two eigenfunctions of
@xmath that differ by a power of @xmath shall be considered equivalent.
From Theorem 3.6 and Corollary 3.8 it easily follows that in this case
the number of independent algebraic eigenfunctions is finite, up to
equivalence. More precisely:

###### Lemma 3.22.

Up to equivalence, the algebraic eigenfunctions of @xmath can be assumed
to belong to a space of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.77)
  -- -------- -- --------

for some spin state @xmath , where @xmath is given by ( 3.22 ).

###### Proof.

Given a spin state @xmath , the obvious identity

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.78)
  -- -------- -- --------

and Eqs. ( 3.7 ), ( 3.31 ), ( 3.32 ), and ( 3.33 ) imply that the gauge
Hamiltonian @xmath preserves the space

  -- -- -- --------
           (3.79)
  -- -- -- --------

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are as in the definition of @xmath in
Theorem 3.6 . Let @xmath be an eigenfunction of @xmath , which as
explained above can be taken as a homogeneous function of @xmath . From
the conditions satisfied by the functions @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
in ( 3.79 ) and the homogeneity of @xmath , it readily follows that
@xmath for some @xmath , as claimed. ∎

###### Theorem 3.23.

The Hamiltonian @xmath possesses the following spin eigenfunctions with
zero momentum

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the center of mass coordinate. Their energies are
respectively given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Any algebraic eigenfunction with well-defined total momentum is
equivalent to a linear combination of the above eigenfunctions.

###### Proof.

By Lemma 3.22 , in order to compute the algebraic eigenfunctions of
@xmath it suffices to diagonalize @xmath in the spaces @xmath given by (
3.77 ). Equations ( 3.31 ), ( 3.32 ), ( 3.33 ) and ( 3.78 ), and the
fact that @xmath preserves the degree of homogeneity, imply that the
following subspaces of @xmath are invariant under @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
                 
     @xmath      (3.80a)
     @xmath      (3.80b)
     @xmath      (3.80c)
  -- -------- -- ---------

From Eqs. ( 3.80 ) it follows that the alternative change of variables
@xmath does not yield additional eigenfunctions of @xmath . Indeed, the
latter change corresponds to the mapping @xmath , which up to
equivalence leaves the subspace ( 3.80a ) invariant and exchanges each
subspace in ( 3.80b ) with the corresponding one in ( 3.80c ). For this
reason, we can safely ignore the subspaces ( 3.80c ) in the computation
that follows, provided that we add to the eigenfunctions of @xmath
obtained from the subspaces ( 3.80b ) their images under the mapping
@xmath .

For the subspaces ( 3.80a )-( 3.80b ), using Eqs. ( 3.7 ), ( 3.12 ), (
3.18 ), ( 3.31 ), ( 3.33 ), and ( 3.34c ) we easily obtain the following
eigenfunctions of @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.81a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.81b)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.81c)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

We have omitted the two additional eigenfunctions

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

from the above list, since they are respectively obtained from ( 3.81b )
and ( 3.81c ) when the spin state @xmath is symmetric. The
eigenfunctions ( 3.81 ) are equivalent to the following “zero momentum”
eigenfunctions:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.82a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.82b)
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.82c)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

where the energies have been computed from those in Eqs. ( 3.81 ) using
Lemma 3.21 . The eigenfunctions of @xmath listed in the statement are
readily obtained from these spin functions together with the transforms
of ( 3.82b ) and ( 3.82c ) under the mapping @xmath . ∎

###### Remark 3.24.

If the spin state @xmath is symmetric, then @xmath for all @xmath , and
one easily obtains from Theorem 3.23 the following eigenfunctions of the
scalar Hamiltonian @xmath :

## Chapter 4 NN spin chains of HS type

### 4.1 Introduction

As we saw in Chapter 2 , one can successfully solve spin chains of HS
type by means of Polychronakos’s freezing trick, which essentially
consists in computing the large coupling constant limit of the quotient
of the partition functions of a spin CS model and its scalar
counterpart.

In the present chapter we shall extend this technique to the case of QES
models of CS type with spin. This extension will prove crucial in the
analysis of the spectrum of the novel @xmath -site chain

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.1)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

with sites @xmath defined by the algebraic system

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here and in what follows, we identify @xmath , @xmath (and similarly for
@xmath and @xmath ), and keep denoting by @xmath the domain ( 3.3a ) and
by @xmath the particles’ spin. It is not difficult to check that the
spin chain ( 4.1 ), which we shall simply call the NN chain , is related
to the NN Hamiltonian @xmath in Eq. ( 3.2a ) along the lines of the
freezing trick.

We shall see in this chapter that this spin chain is in some sense
intermediate between the Heisenberg chain (short-range,
position-independent interactions) and the PF chain (long-range,
position-dependent interactions), from which one can derive the
Hamiltonian ( 4.1 ) by retaining only nearest-neighbors interactions.
Moreover, @xmath turns out to be QES in the sense that a nontrivial
proper subset of the spectrum can be explicitly computed for any value
of @xmath and @xmath . While QES models have long played a relevant role
in the theory of CS systems [ 179 , 180 ] , this is to our best
knowledge the first QES phenomenon spotted in the (as has been made
clear in this dissertation) closely related field of HS spin chains.

The results in this chapter can be easily modified to deal with the NN
chains

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

where the chain sites are respectively defined by

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

These spin chains are obtained from the NN models ( 3.2b ) and ( 3.2c )
respectively by a freezing trick argument. Note, however, that the sites
of the second chain turn out to be equally spaced, so @xmath is
essentially the Heisenberg chain.

This chapter is organized as follows. In Section 4.2 we analyze the
distribution of the chain sites using both exact results and numerical
calculations. In Section 4.3 we show the QES nature of the chain by
providing several families of eigenvectors, valid for any choice of
@xmath and @xmath . The main technical tool is a nontrivial refinement
of the freezing trick developed in Chapter 2 which also applies to QES
systems. Finally, we discuss some qualitative properties of the spectrum
and formulate an intriguing conjecture claiming that an eigenvalue of
the chain is algebraic if and only if it is an integer.

The material presented in this chapter is taken from Ref. [ 63 ] .

### 4.2 The chain sites

We shall begin with a detailed analysis of the distribution of the chain
sites on the line in which we shall combine exact results and numerical
computations to extract as much information as possible. An easy
observation, which stems from the spin chain’s connection with the
dynamical model ( 3.2a ) that will be developed in the next section, is
that the sites are given by the coordinates of a critical point of the
function

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is the scaled logarithm of the ground state function of the NN
Hamiltonian ( 3.2a ).

The first questions to ascertain refer to the existence and uniqueness
of the critical points of @xmath . In this direction we have the
following result, which is roughly analogous to Proposition ( 2.20 ):

###### Proposition 4.1.

The function @xmath has a unique critical point @xmath in @xmath , which
is a hyperbolic maximum. Moreover, @xmath satisfies

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

###### Proof.

The existence of a maximum of @xmath in @xmath is clear, since it is
continuous in @xmath and tends to @xmath both on its boundary and as
@xmath . Uniqueness and hyperbolicity follow from the fact that the
Hessian of @xmath is negative definite in @xmath . Indeed, by
Gerschgorin’s theorem [ 96 , 15.814] , the eigenvalues of the Hessian of
@xmath at @xmath lie in the union of the intervals

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and thus all the eigenvalues of the Hessian of @xmath are strictly
negative.

Furthermore, the mapping

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is a symmetry of @xmath and maps the domain @xmath into itself. Since
@xmath is the unique critical point of @xmath in @xmath , it must be a
fixed point of the above transformation, and thus Eqs. ( 4.4 ) follow. ∎

From the previous proposition (and also directly from Eq. ( 4.2 )), it
immediately follows that the center of mass of the spins vanishes, i.e.,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

###### Proposition 4.2.

@xmath .

###### Proof.

Let us write @xmath in terms of the variables @xmath and @xmath , i.e.,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Obviously

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

as we wanted to show. ∎

It is convenient to think of the spins as if located on a circle. In
this way, the chain ( 4.1 ) truly presents only near-neighbors
interactions in spite of the fact that the first spin interacts with the
last one. Indeed, if the site coordinate @xmath is understood as an arc
length in a circle of radius

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

as shown in Fig. 4.1 , the spins at the sites @xmath and @xmath become
nearest-neighbors and, moreover, the strength of the interaction is
inversely proportional to the squared distance between the spins,
measured along the arc.

We saw in Section 1.8 that the site coordinates of the PF chain define
the @xmath -th Hermite polynomial. It is natural to wonder whether a
similar result holds for the family of monic polynomials

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

defined by @xmath , which can be regarded as the closest NN analog of
the PF chain. In the following proposition we answer this question
negatively:

###### Proposition 4.3.

The polynomials ( 4.7 ) do not form an orthogonal family.

###### Proof.

In order to show that the family @xmath is not orthogonal, it suffices
to prove that the polynomials ( 4.7 ) do not satisfy a three-term
recursion relation of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with @xmath constant. In fact, solving the system ( 4.2 ) for @xmath one
immediately obtains

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus the previous recursion relation already fails for @xmath . ∎

The sites are certainly not equally spaced; in fact, our numerical
computations lead to the following

###### Claim 4.4.

For @xmath , the site distribution follows the Gaussian law with zero
mean and unit variance.

Note that, should the site distribution follow a Gaussian law, its mean
would be zero on account of Corollary 4.5 . We have solved numerically
Eq. ( 4.2 ) for the positions of the chain sites for up to @xmath spins,
and the results completely support the validity of the above conjecture.
More precisely, we claim that the cumulative density of sites

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is Heaviside’s step function, is asymptotically given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

The agreement between the functions @xmath and @xmath is remarkably good
for @xmath (see Fig. 4.2 for the case @xmath ) and increases steadily
with @xmath . For example, the mean square error of the fit for @xmath ,
@xmath and 200 spins is respectively @xmath , @xmath and @xmath .

###### Heuristic proof of Claim 4.4.

The fact that for large @xmath the cumulative density of sites is well
approximated by the Gaussian law ( 4.9 ) can be justified by the
following semi-rigorous argument. Let @xmath be a smooth function such
that @xmath for @xmath , and define the rescaled function @xmath . By
Eq. ( 4.2 ), the latter function must satisfy the relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

for @xmath and @xmath . Let us now assume that Eq. ( 4.10 ) holds for
all @xmath and all @xmath . Writing

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and using the expansion

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

the leading term in Eq. ( 4.10 ) yields the differential equation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The general solution of this equation is implicitly given by

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.11)
  -- -- -- --------

Hence, up to terms of order @xmath , the cumulative distribution
function of the chain sites (normalized to unity) is approximated by the
continuous function

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The normalization conditions @xmath and @xmath imply that @xmath , and
thus the empiric law ( 4.9 ) is recovered.

From Eq. ( 4.11 ) (with @xmath ) it follows that the site @xmath can be
determined up to terms of order @xmath by the formula

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

Note that, were the sites @xmath exactly given by the previous formula,
they would satisfy the identity

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which is clearly inconsistent with the exact relation ( 4.4 ). However,
the slightly modified formula

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

differs from ( 4.12 ) by a term of order @xmath and is fully consistent
with the relation ( 4.4 ). Although both ( 4.12 ) and ( 4.13 ) provide
an excellent approximation to the chain sites for large @xmath , the
latter equation is always more accurate than the former, and can be used
to estimate @xmath with remarkable precision even for relatively low
values of @xmath , cf. Fig. 4.3 .

∎

In the rest of this section we shall analyze several relevant features
of the site distribution using the above heuristic approach. It is
certainly of interest to determine whether the position of the last spin
tends to infinity as @xmath , since according to our interpretation of
the chain’s geometry the number @xmath is the radius of the circle on
which the spins lie. According to Eq. ( 4.13 ), for large @xmath the
last spin’s coordinate @xmath is approximately given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

so that @xmath should diverge as @xmath . Of course, this assertion
should be taken with some caution, since in Eq. ( 4.13 ) the argument of
the inverse error function is correct only up to terms of order @xmath .
In order to check the correctness of the approximation ( 4.14 ), we use
the asymptotic expansion of @xmath for @xmath in Ref. [ 26 ] to
replace ( 4.14 ) by the simpler formula

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

As can be seen in Fig. 4.4 , the approximate formula ( 4.15 )
qualitatively reproduces the growth of @xmath when @xmath ranges from
@xmath to @xmath . A greater accuracy can be achieved by introducing an
adjustable parameter in Eq. ( 4.14 ) through the replacement @xmath , so
that in Eq. ( 4.15 ) @xmath becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

In Fig. 4.4 , we have also plotted the law ( 4.15 )-( 4.16 ) with the
optimal value @xmath , which is in excellent agreement with the
numerical values of @xmath for @xmath .

The last property of the spin chain ( 4.1 ) that we shall analyze in
this section is the dependence of the coupling between neighboring spins
on their mean coordinate. Calling

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we shall now see that when @xmath the Gaussian law

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.17)
  -- -- -- --------

holds with remarkable precision, cf. Fig. 4.5 . Indeed, if @xmath
denotes the RHS of Eq. ( 4.13 ) we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

so that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is of order @xmath . Hence, up to terms of order @xmath we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since (up to terms of order @xmath )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Eq. ( 4.17 ) follows from ( 4.18 ) replacing @xmath by @xmath .

A brief comparison of the previous properties with those of the PF chain
( 1.28 ) is in order. For large @xmath , the density of sites of the PF
chain (normalized to unity), that is the density of zeros of the @xmath
-th Hermite polynomial, is asymptotically given by [ 36 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

The last site @xmath of the PF chain grows with @xmath much faster than
the corresponding site @xmath of the chain ( 4.1 ), for the largest zero
of the @xmath -th Hermite polynomial behaves as @xmath ; see, for
instance, the recent paper [ 56 ] .

### 4.3 Quasi-exact solvability of the NN chain

In this section we shall explore the solvability properties of the spin
chain ( 4.1 ) by exploiting its connection with the QES model @xmath
defined in ( 3.2a ). As in Section 2.5 , we shall rescale the constant
@xmath in the latter Schrödinger operator and its scalar counterpart
@xmath and remove the ground state energy, defining

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In terms of the matrix multiplication operator

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

the connection between @xmath and @xmath can be simply written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

whereas the spin chain Hamiltonian ( 4.1 ) is recovered as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

Recall that the ground state function of the scalar Hamiltonian @xmath
can be written as @xmath , cf. Table 3.1 and Eq. ( 4.3 ). We shall also
denote by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

its normalized square. The following result is easily established by
repeating the proof of Lemma 2.22 .

###### Lemma 4.5.

@xmath converges to the delta distribution supported at @xmath and
decays exponentially fast away from @xmath .

One would be tempted to believe that, mutatis mutandis, the discussion
of Section ( 2.5 ) would provide an appropriate bridge to link the
algebraic states of @xmath and @xmath . However, the fact that the
dynamical models @xmath and @xmath are only quasi-exactly solvable, and
thus only a proper subset of their spectra is known, makes it impossible
to compute their partition functions from their algebraic energies.
Hence Lemma 2.26 , which constitutes the core of the application of CS
models to the study of spin chains, cannot be invoked in this case.

In the rest of this chapter we shall develop a finer version of the
freezing trick that will enable us to circumvent this limitation. We
shall obtain a number of eigenstates of the chain (which we call
algebraic ), valid for any choice of @xmath and @xmath . As mentioned in
the introduction, these algebraic states do not span the whole spin
space, the chain Hamiltonian ( 4.1 ) thus inheriting the QES structure
of the dynamical model.

In the following lemma we prove the key convergence result (“freezing
trick”) that shall enable us to compute the algebraic eigenvectors of
@xmath in closed form. This result is most easily stated in terms of the
function @xmath , that is, the normalized ground state of @xmath .
Moreover, given a scalar function @xmath and a spin state @xmath , we
shall use the notation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

to denote their @xmath -valued scalar product.

###### Lemma 4.6.

Let @xmath be an algebraic eigenfunction of @xmath with energy @xmath
(cf. Theorem 3.17 ). Assume that there exists an eigenfunction @xmath of
@xmath and a @xmath -valued polynomial @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

and suppose, moreover, that these eigenfunctions can be normalized so
that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then the limits

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

exist, and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Proof.

The existence of the above limits trivially follows from the polynomial
dependence of @xmath and @xmath on @xmath and the fact that @xmath is
linear in @xmath . Furthermore, the self-adjointness of @xmath , Eqs. (
4.21 )-( 4.22 ) and Lemma 4.5 readily imply that

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath            
  -- -------- -------- --

If we now use Eq. ( 4.20 ) and Lemma 4.5 to write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

substitute the former equations into this identity and take the limit
@xmath , we readily derive Eq. ( 4.24 ). ∎

###### Corollary 4.7.

If @xmath , then @xmath is an eigenvector of @xmath with energy @xmath .

###### Remark 4.8.

Since, by Lemma 4.5 ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

the previous corollary is of no practical use unless @xmath can be taken
as the normalized ground state @xmath , in which case @xmath .

We are now ready to prove the main result of this chapter.

###### Theorem 4.9.

If @xmath and @xmath , the states

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.25a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.25b)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.25c)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.25d)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

satisfy the equations

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

The proof consists in the application of Lemma 4.6 to appropriate
triples @xmath , where in fact @xmath (and hence @xmath ) in view of the
previous remark.

In the first place, it is easy to show that @xmath directly. However, we
prefer to prove it using the same freezing trick argument as in the
other cases. To this end, consider the functions

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

which trivially satisfy the hypotheses in Lemma 4.6 with @xmath and
@xmath . Since in this case

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

from Corollary 4.7 it follows that @xmath , if non-vanishing, is an
eigenvector of @xmath with eigenvalue @xmath .

The next case is slightly more complicated. Let us set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It is not difficult to show that @xmath satisfies the hypotheses in
Lemma 4.6 with @xmath . Since @xmath in this case, Corollary 4.7 shows
that the state

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

is either zero or an eigenvector of @xmath with energy 1. Here we have
used the identity @xmath , cf. Corollary 4.5 .

The other two states are obtained in a similar manner starting with
@xmath and the functions

  -- -------- --
              
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

in each case. Indeed, with the former set of functions we immediately
arrive at

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

while in the latter case we obtain

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Using Proposition 4.2 , the result follows. ∎

###### Remark 4.10.

All the algebraic energies of @xmath being integral multiples of @xmath
, it follows that any eigenvalue of the chain constructed from them via
a freezing argument must be an integer.

###### Remark 4.11.

The linear combinations of eigenfunctions with energy 2 and 3 used in
Theorem 4.9 are not casual. Should one start, e.g., with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for which @xmath and @xmath , one would be lead to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The above linear combinations have been chosen so as to suppress the
dominant parts in @xmath and @xmath , which respectively are
proportional to @xmath and @xmath .

It is also clear that the state @xmath (resp. @xmath ) is zero whenever
the spin vector @xmath (resp. @xmath ) is not symmetric
(resp. antisymmetric) under @xmath , which accounts for the condition on
@xmath and @xmath imposed in Eqs. ( 4.25b ) and ( 4.25d ).

It is natural to wonder whether additional eigenvectors of the chain can
be computed using some different linear combinations of the algebraic
eigenfunctions of @xmath listed in Theorem 3.17 . Nevertheless, since

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

it is clear that an algebraic eigenfunction in the linear span of @xmath
, @xmath and @xmath can only give rise to a nonvanishing vector @xmath
when @xmath and @xmath . Indeed, @xmath , with @xmath , is an
eigenfunction of @xmath with energy @xmath , which implies that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

as @xmath , proving the former statement. The latter condition follows
directly from the factor @xmath present at the above eigenfunctions of
@xmath . This discussion strongly suggests (albeit does not rigorously
prove) that one cannot obtain any additional eigenvectors of @xmath
using the technique developed in Lemma 4.6 and Theorem 4.9 .

### 4.4 Qualitative properties of the algebraic spectrum

In this section we shall analyze which portion of the spectrum of ( 4.1
) is algebraic and how the algebraic eigenvalues are embedded into the
whole spectrum. Regarding the first point, it is convenient to start
with the following states @xmath , whose evaluation at @xmath yields the
chain eigenvectors ( 4.25 ):

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

It may be easily shown that if @xmath is symmetric then @xmath and
@xmath vanish at @xmath . Likewise, if @xmath then @xmath is also zero
when @xmath . For this reason, we shall consider the following spaces:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

###### Proposition 4.12.

The dimensions of the spaces @xmath are given by

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.26)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.27)
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.28)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

###### Proof.

First of all, the dimension of @xmath is simply the number of
permutations with repetitions of @xmath elements from @xmath .

Consider next the space @xmath . If two basic states @xmath and @xmath
differ by a permutation of the last @xmath spins, then @xmath . Hence
the dimension of @xmath is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the first quantity is the number of possible choices for @xmath ,
the second one is that of symmetric states of @xmath particles, and the
last one, that of symmetric states of @xmath particles.

The dimension of @xmath coincides with that of the space @xmath , a
basis of which was computed in Propositions 3.10 and 3.13 . Using the
previous notation we can say that, for a given spin content @xmath with
multiplicities @xmath (with @xmath ), there are @xmath independent
states in @xmath . Hence

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the binomial term accounts for the different choices of @xmath ,
and the cardinal for all the possible values of the multiplicities.
Noting @xmath and using the identity

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we arrive at the desired formula.

It only remains to prove Eq. ( 4.28 ). To this end, let us concentrate
on the spin vectors @xmath with a fixed spin content @xmath , @xmath .
It is clear that @xmath is spanned by the @xmath states

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We shall shortly show that, for all @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

By antisymmetry, the double sum @xmath vanishes, so there are at most
@xmath independent relations of the above form. It can be verified that
@xmath is in fact a basis of @xmath , so the dimension of @xmath is
obtained from (ii) by substituting @xmath for @xmath .

Finally, let us prove ( 4.29 ). A first observation is that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Hence

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

The first two terms of the RHS obviously cancel, and the last one
vanishes by antisymmetry. ∎

This proposition, which is interesting in its own right because of its
connection with the dynamical model ( 3.2a ), has the following
consequences for the spin chain ( 4.1 ):

###### Corollary 4.13.

For each @xmath , the number of algebraic eigenvectors with energy
@xmath is bounded by @xmath .

###### Corollary 4.14.

The ratio

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

tends to zero as @xmath . The whole kernel of @xmath is composed of
algebraic eigenvectors.

###### Proof.

The first part of the statement follows by direct comparison with the
total number of states @xmath . The second part is due to the fact that
@xmath is a linear combination with positive coefficients of the
nonnegative operators @xmath , which implies that @xmath . ∎

These observations are corroborated by our numerical simulations: the
number of algebraic levels increase as @xmath and @xmath become larger,
but nevertheless they span a lesser and lesser part of the spin space.
The kernel of the chain, e.g., shows clearly this behavior. But most
remarkable is the following conjecture regarding the embedding of the
algebraic eigenvalues in the spectrum.

###### Conjecture 4.15.

The algebraic eigenvectors ( 4.25a )–( 4.25c ) span the three lowest
levels of the spin chain ( 4.1 ). When @xmath the fourth algebraic
energy, @xmath , is however the fifth lowest level of the chain, and its
whole eigenspace is spanned by the states of the form ( 4.25d ). The
algebraic energies are singled out in the spectrum of @xmath as being
the only integer ones, i.e.,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We have numerically diagonalized the matrix representing the Hamiltonian
@xmath for @xmath and up to @xmath particles, and our results fully
support the above conjecture. Another important observation is that the
standard freezing trick relation between the energies of the spin chain
@xmath and of the dynamical models @xmath and @xmath , namely

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the fact that @xmath has noninteger eigenvalues imply that the spin
dynamical model ( 3.2a ) has noninteger energies, and hence that some of
its eigenfunctions are not among those listed in Theorem 3.17 .

## Chapter 5 Conclusions and perspectives

In this thesis we have studied three QES models of CS type presenting
short-range interactions and developed a rigorous treatment of the CS/HS
correspondence, valid for both ES and QES Hamiltonians. In a nutshell,
the main conclusions and results that one should extract from this
dissertation are the following:

1.  On the @xmath HS spin chain: We have computed the spectrum of the
    trigonometric @xmath Sutherland model by expressing its Hamiltonian
    as the sum of squares of an appropriate set of commuting Dunkl
    operators. The @xmath HS chain is obtained from this system by
    “freezing” the particles at their classical equilibrium positions.
    We have proved a rigorous version of the freezing trick which has
    enabled us to compute the partition function of the chain in terms
    of those of the corresponding scalar and spin models. We have
    resorted to numerical computations to explore the level distribution
    of the chain, finding out that the energies accurately follow the
    Gaussian law. A constant magnetic field was added to the picture in
    a rather straightforward way.

2.  On NN spin models: We defined three QES spin models with
    near-neighbors interactions that are related to NN versions of the
    sum of the squares of appropriate sets of @xmath Dunkl operators.
    Furthermore, we have obtained infinite flags of finite-dimensional
    spaces invariant under these models, and computed several families
    of eigenfunctions in closed form by diagonalizing the restriction of
    the Hamiltonians to these spaces. All the algebraic solutions, whose
    energies are integers, can be expressed as the ground state times a
    symmetric function. We conjecture that some of their eigenfunctions
    are not of this form, and that their corresponding eigenvalues are
    not natural numbers.

3.  On NN spin chains: We have defined a spin chain presenting
    nearest-neighbors interactions that is related to one of the
    previous NN models by a freezing trick argument. We have discussed
    its site distribution in detail, both analytically and numerically,
    and obtained a number of algebraic eigenvectors and energies using a
    refinement of the techniques developed in Chapter 2 that also
    applies to QES systems. We have raised the conjecture that the only
    integer energies of this chain are @xmath and @xmath , and that the
    eigenstates corresponding to these energies are all algebraic.

The conjectures scattered throughout the text do not exhaust all the
open questions that we find worth exploring in connection with our work.
In what follows, we shall briefly mention some wide research lines that
in our opinion would be of interest, and that we intend to follow in the
near future:

1.  The structure of the (non-algebraic) eigenfunctions of @xmath (and
    other QES operators): From the previous discussion, it looks
    unlikely that all the eigenfunctions of @xmath admit the ground
    state as a Jastrow factor. Nevertheless, this does happen in the
    theory of CS models, and the functions that are explicitly
    constructed in the usual QES models are generally of this form. A
    thorough study of this phenomenon is, to the best of our knowledge,
    still lacking, and would probably shed some light on the connections
    between Schrödinger operators and orthogonal polynomials. The
    particular case of @xmath would be of special interest.

2.  HS/CS and symmetric spaces: A powerful procedure for constructing CS
    models with spin starting out with a symmetric space of nonpositive
    curvature has been recently developed by Fehér and Pusztai, as
    described in Section 1.5 . It should not be difficult to extend the
    techniques described in this thesis to solve the associated spin
    chains.

3.  Statistical properties of the spectrum of CS models: The remarkable
    statistical properties of the @xmath HS chain occupied a significant
    portion of Section 2.6 . It is difficult to obtain pen and paper
    results on these aspects, but the rigorous literature studying these
    topics is always increasing (see [ 38 , 49 ] and references
    therein). Further study of the topics mentioned in this section and
    extensions to the case of NN models would make a valuable addition
    to the existing literature.

4.  Integrability vs. solvability in spin chains of HS type: A
    satisfactory analysis of the integrability of the chains of HS type
    has only been accomplished in a few instances. A natural approach to
    this problem would be to define a set of integrals of the chain
    using the freezing trick, but in general it is not easy to grant the
    linear independence of these conserved operators. If one managed to
    overcome these technical problems, this method (which has already
    been exploited in the study of some particular models) would provide
    a clean proof of the integrability of the chains associated with
    integrable spin models.
